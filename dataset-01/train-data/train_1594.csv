1,Motsenbocker Lift Off #3 Stain Remover,Product is absolutely 100% WORTHLESS - simply does not workTried it on a number of items - waste of time
1,I sent it back,"The photos were blurry, maybe that was done on purpose to make the subject more mysterious. I have read all of the books on Mongolia and this is the only one I sent back."
4,david loves this game!!!!,"My 5-year-old says this is his favorite Leapster game - and he has several. He loves math so it's a hit with him. He can play this game on long car trips and the trips don't seem so long. If your child enjoys math, numbers and counting - they will enjoy this game."
3,good game,"my daughter likes the game a lot and she's constantly playing it.it has taught her numbers, etc. the game itself seems to be a littlechoppy. from time to time it will freeze."
4,Nice Touch!,"Perfect for keeping the jacket wrinkle free. Easy enough to install and remove.I am using it in an Acura TL. I expect it will work in any automobile the has the same type of two rod headrest supports (i.e. not just for BMW).Only comment I'll make is that it could be a bit sturdier - the hanger has a bit more flex in it than I prefer. Time will tell... That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.Overall, I am very pleased with the product."
2,Extremely overpriced.,"Extremely overpriced, but if you own a Break My Wallet and want an official B.M.W. coathanger, then bend over and grab your ankles. I've purchased many genuine BMW parts from a dealership and most of the time, I'm pleasantly surprised by how inexpensive it is. Not so with this part.This is not a criticism of the company I purchased it from (Lukas). Their price was very similar to the dealership price (where I get a substantial ""frequent flyer"" discount). This appears to be a discontinued item that the dealership could no longer get, so Lukas was my backup.On top of this, it isn't very convenient to use in a hatchback (probably the same goes for coupes). I have to tilt the seatback forward to use it. The main hanger part can dislodge from the base and fall to the floor a little to easily. I'm also slightly concerned about rear seat passengers doing a face plant on it during hard braking or a front-end collision."
5,William Bounds Salt and Pepper Mill,"This is the third in a series of Salt and Pepper Mills that we have bought from William Bounds company.We average almost 25 years each before we buy a new one. They all still work fine we mainly replace them because they have been dropped, chipped, etc. Other then our own caused damage they work GREAT!!!"
1,Painfully bad.,I would heartily recommend skipping this book. I feel obligated to read a book through to its conclusion (to give the author every chance to make the point he's trying to make). This was a torturous experience for this book.
3,Doesn't really excel as a red or white light,"This is a good idea, but it doesn't really hit the mark. The white light isn't really bright enough and the red light is too bright to be night vision friendly. This would be a much better product is they changed the LED arrangement to one (or maybe two) red LEDs and five white LEDs. You can operate the red and white simultaneously, but it doesn't increase visability significantly. Might be OK for camping, but it doesn't really make a good aviation flashlight. The unit appears to be well constructed and uses standard batteries."
4,Reasonably robust.,"The flashlight has a metal body, seems robust, emits light of the advertised colors and intensities. Switches not quite perfect, but close enough for most purposes."
4,Great for astronomy,This is great for astronomy. White flashlight for setting up and taking down equipment -- red for looking at star charts -- all in one inexpensive package.
2,Wake Up,"Obviously the viewer is making a leap of faith when he/she decides to believe Jonas is telling us the truth about any of this. I felt we watched an interesting, heart-warming movie about his life of late, but I couldn't help feeling a bit 'off' about it all. I wanted to be convinced, but he rung false to me, I got that vibe D:If I'm wrong, I wish him and his family all the best. And regardless of any powers, working on spirituality is brave and important.The fact that he was a film maker before anything happened to him also made me put my guard up. Getting J.Z Knight in the film only made things worse, she's so dicey, and finding that out is only a google search away... did he do that?I did enjoy the segments with the energy healer, and the sufi mystic, they had some interesting contributions to make.I give the film 5/10"
2,christian spirituality,"It was not what I expected. The description doesn`t suggest that the content is christian biased. If you are looking after something esoteric or exploring new age mystisism, that` s not it. It is about the awakening of a christian inside you."
5,Great Film!,Started off slow but picked up. Great documentary about an ordinary guy given a gifthe doesn't know what to do with which forces him on the seekers path.You see him change as he progresses in the movie.I show movies at our local non-profit and I'll be adding this to the list.
1,Me Me Me,"Why is this happening to ME, Me me me me, I must find out what it means to ME. Maybe there's a God but it's all about Me. I need to listen to other spiritualists but it's ME. Girlfriend, why aren't you paying attention to ME.My god. What a selfish prick.At one point the guy says he's turned away from his upbringing in Christianity. I could see why. At it's true core Christianity is about accepting the fact there's someone or something greater than YOU out there. Followed by the idea that you should love and help others.All this documentary does is follow a guy's self-interest quest. Assuming it's even true which I doubt, but even if it is, the dude has a lot to learn."
5,Inspiring and thought provoking,"I first saw this on OWN network, and then bought it on Amazon. This was such a great film, it was done well and you could really relate to Jonas and his girlfriend. I've watched it twice and had insight to something different both times. Jonas was just a regular guy who had this amazing experience/epiphany and he takes you on his journey of embracing this gift. It was so inspiring .. I wish there were more films like this."
4,max cell,i give it 4 and a half stars. you see goku and trunks at ssj ultra2. after it is over watch brolly. uncut is better. than watch cell games. im tellin you its awesome!
1,Access 2000 Programming - A Crashed Course,"I was very disappointed in this book! Within the Preface, Acknowledgements and the First Session alone there were miss-spelled and missing words, and references to applications that didn't work. Granted, it does say it that you must have Access 2000, but even with Access 2000 this book is more of a crash than a crash course. My recommendation.... look for information on Access 2000 elsewhere! You get what you pay for here."
2,Disappointed in Book & CD,"I received my book and was so excited about reading up on programming in Access2000. I know a bit about about programming and I know Access2000 somewhat, however, this book jumps around too much. Their are NO instructions on setting up the CD-Rom, so your on your own their. When you finally figure out how to get the files off the CD they do not come up. You have to keep digging until you find the files shown in the dialog box at the top of the illustrations. The book never says what file to retrieve. Once you do find the files they do not match the book. The idea of a book like this is to TEACH me programming, not have me trying to figure out what the author is doing and debugging this book. Didn't learn much. In fact, I may return the book."
1,Content doesn't deliver what title promises,"I'm an MIS professional. From this book's title and a quick browse at the bookstore, I thought it would be just what I needed to quickly come up on Access VBA, given my experience (including Access database design and Word VBA). Wrong! There's no way you could spend a weekend with this book and come away with anything more than theoretical knowledge, because there's no chance to apply anything.Incredibly, there are no step-by-step exercises in the book and no practice databases on the CD. What looked, at first glance, to be exercises actually turned out to be just explanations in numeric form. Apparently, connecting the book's explanations with the CD's finished code (a time-consuming exercise in itself) is supposed to teach you all you need to know about Access VBA. I've taught enough computer courses to know it just doesn't work that way."
3,Good For Intermediate Access Programmers,"This book assumes quite a bit about your background in Access and VBA and is not suitable for a beginner. However, the authors have significant experience in developing commerical access applications and I found the code and attendant explanations more than worth the price of the book. I aggree that the book works around one application, but as a developer often seeking more efficient ways of using the tools, I found the book to be very helpful, and provided some tips and techniques that I have not used as often as I may in the future. Overall, a good book for reference and review of specific techniques. Not on a par with Ken Getz's books, but very helpful in production code work."
1,Disappointed in Book & CD,I was disappointed in the book and CD. They did not go together and your on your own when it comes to figuring out which file to use as an example. I spent more time trying to figure out what to do with the files than actually learning. Not much help here.
5,SohoDecor Decorative Garden Tulip Solar Lights,"Absolutely great product, have had it 2 months, works extremely well, highly recommended. Just be careful to bend the lights in a way that the whole structure is balanced. Maybe you can add a put a velcro at the bottom. Advise to anchor the structure in case of storm, the whole thing may tip over otherwise."
4,"Very much a joy to read, and I learned a lot from it.","There's obviously a great amount of research that went into the writing of this book. So many interesting facts regarding some very important cases. Great background book if your looking for a casual read while studying law, but are too nervous to read something that doesn't involve the law.It stands on it's own, though, and I think will be interesting to anyone interested in Criminal Procedure, it's evolution. Surprising in many ways, but at the same time, not so surprising.I guess my only gripe with this book is that on some stories, there's a bit of editorializing in a manner that may or may not be consistent with the facts, but the authors' views are valuable. Sometimes you just can't tell where the opining begins and ends.I very much enjoyed this book. (a bit costly perhaps, but a great read)"
4,Glad I bought it,"I'm reviewing the Kindle version (just to be clear). I use the Kindle app on my iPad and Macbook and my only compaint is that the page numbers in the software don't match the page numbers in the physical copy of the book. This was an optional book for a class I was taking, so there was a little difficulty in matching the recommended page numbers on the syllabus with those of the version I was attempting to read. I don't fault the book, this is a software issue - just wanted to make sure that potential buyers are aware of the fact. Anyway, on to the substance: this is a good book. It really makes some of the dry opinions that you read in the textbook come to life with lots of well written and researched background and history of the cases. You get a much better picture of the litigation strategies and social/cultural climate that surrounded these cases. I would recommend."
1,"Beautiful Music, but Terrible Recording Quality","This is my second attempt to obtain a playable copy of this 2 CD set. Maurice Abravenel and the Utah Symphony did a good job of interpeting this fantastic music, but VOX did not do their part. The first set of CD's bombed shortly after starting CD no. 1. I notified Amazon and they promptly sent me a second sealed set. The first time through was okay, but on the third playing, CD no. 1 again failed. It is not playable. However, CD no. 2 appears to be okay. I feel saddened for Mistro Abravenel and the Utah Symphony that their efforts were not matched by the quality of the reproduction."
5,Wonderful songs for children.,"This set of books - Salvation Songs for Children - has almost gone out of print. I was so glad to find these on Amazon.com.They are just right for teaching Sunday School and Vacation Bible School, and for family worship. I hope they will be reprinted andnever go out of print. Having the music with the words is a double blessing."
3,Good performances but badly overpriced,"This is one strange download. Vox used to be one of the leading labels when it came to budget recordings. If you were a college student and could not afford one of the major labels, you could always depend on Vox for quality and a very large repertoire. This set of Schumann symphonies came out some time in the '70's. The performances are quite good with the exception of No. 3 which is too slow and lacking in both energy and passion. The orchestral playing throughout is exceptional.The problem is the price. It costs more than double that of Muti, Barenboim, Von Karajan, etc. For 20 dollars you can get both the Schumann and Brahms symphonies and still have change. I think somebody at Amazon made a boo-boo on the price. Based on the label, the age of the recording and the competition, this set should cost about 5 dollars and not a penny more."
3,Not Great,"This is really low budget stuff. Very few fighters you would know unless you are a die hard fan of MMA. The fights themselves are decent, though hardly world class caliber. The problem is the visuals. The camera work is very poor, and everything is so dark. At least the announcer seems to know a little bit about the sport. This one is for MMA fans who have everything else and want to collect everything."
5,Unimaginable heroic story,"It is a compelling well written story. This book has touched me deeply for their pain, suffering, and inspiring will to live. I truly appreciate those that risk their lives for our freedom. Amazing story, you can't put the book down. Read it, you won't regret."
2,Nothing but problems,"I recently bought one of these cards. Everything was fine for the first couple of months. Thing worked fine. Then the fan on it went bad. It growls really loud nonstop. So i called the customer support. They told me they don't cover it until the fan actually goes out and destroys the whole card. So then frustrated, I asked if i could just buy another. and they said no!!!"
4,"Good card, works fine for normal use","This card was an add-on to my old system so I could run advanced (at that time) graphics. It makes video less of a strain on the processor, and improves resolution over on-board graphics."
2,disappointing,I bought this from Computer Geek. They sent me a refurbished one but it was not advertised as such. I was very disappointed since the effect proves to be defective. I wondered if PNY makes poor quality PCI card or because it was refurbished. I probably would stay away from PNY anyway.
5,Buena calidad,"Excelente presentación y calidad del producto, con una terminación perfecta, y se adapta a muchos estilos de reloj de diferentes marcas."
3,A disappointment after the first...,"The Kindle download for this book comes with Shoofly Pie, which I quite enjoyed. Not so much with Chop Shop though. For one, bugs play a much smaller role compared to the first book. I really enjoyed the entomological aspects that made both Nick and the mystery at hand unique.My second problem was with Nick himself. I kind of lost who he was starting to be in Shoofly: quirky, kind of Aspergerish. In Chop Shop he seemed kind of more like Indiana Jones with thick glasses.I'm not entirely sure if I will continue on with the Bug Man. So-so mysteries are like mediocre science fiction: ubiquitous and hard to finish."
4,Good Book,I like Tim Downs work. This book is not his best but OK if you like him and his work. It is worth the price. Good but not great.
5,"Smart, Funny, Fun = One Great Book - mild spoiler warning","I had almost come to the point of despair over how few truly wonderful books I've read of late. This book cured that. I count myself lucky to be such a latecomer to this series because now I can snap up a few more of them without waiting. Why isn't this author world wide famous? His story has plot, humor, action, intellect, and handles them very well.Dr. Polchak is an interesting character. Not your typical drop-dead gorgeous hero, but a smart guy who isn't afraid to take risks or dump himself and some poor woman into a river if the cause is right.Some plot twists seemed a little too convenient, but that's the way a tight story's run. Dr. McKay is a nice foil to the lovable bug man.Most importantly, this book made me laugh. I hate mysteries that simply overdo the seriousness factor. Chop Shop handles humor with a deft hand. Many many thanks to the author for this intriguing tale."
4,Trot along with this lively duo!,"This book was a delightful surprise! At times heartbreaking, at times laugh out loud funny, it portrays the solid friendship of Terence and Owen. The banter between the two is especially priceless! I was quite happy to clop along side them on their journey!"
2,That was so crap,They should let u listen to the whole song before letting you write thisi hope u listen to this or i would rate this item on a one star next time!!!
5,Good Shoe,"I got my husband this shoe after he stepped on a ring shank nail in July. He is a carpenter, and nails are a major hazard (which we had previously taken some-what for granted). We got the shoes because thy have the steel shank in the sole to protect your foot.They are comfortable as well as protective, and he has worn them everyday since (about 9 mo.). And, even after so much wear, they are holding together well- he hasn't even had to replace the laces!"
4,The Edited Version?,"This book was advertised as ""exciting historical fiction,"" and the author has an interesting way of interjecting his real-life characters into actual historical events ala James Michener. But unlike a Michener novel, these stories left me wanting more. I don't need to know how the Texas hills were created by volcanic upheaval, or how the dinosaurs turned into oil deposits, to enjoy a story about Texas oilmen.I did find myself wishing a few of the events, such as the double murder that goes along with the oilmens' story, had gotten a little more play. But all in all, this book was very much like reading the abridged version of a Michener novel, which was very appealing for me. BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,So much Fun . . .,"Being a big fan of Basia, I learned about her beginnings with Matt Bianco.Much in the same style as Basia, Matt Bianco is an enjoyable blend of; Salsa/Jazz/Swing/R & B and pure fun. A must have for Basia fans and those who enjoy upbeat happy MUSIC."
4,Matt Bianco still swinging,"Basia's harmonies really stand out and the arrangements are fantastic especially with the headphones on. Quality always floats to the top and Matt Bianco proves that their blend of jazzy hipsway, brassy funk and bossa nova groove never goes out of style. This has it all."
4,buen libro con mal fin así que solo cuatro estrillas,Es cuento de una familia méxicana que vienen a EE UU en 1950's a hallar trabajo. Es se dijo a el niño y es en parte una autobiografía. Es un libro corto de 120 paginas y facil a leer. Un buen libro para el joven pero no tiene fin feliz. Quiza el autor usted quiere a leer su segundo libro que es una continuación de este cuento.
1,haven't received the book purchased a month ago,Today is October 5th and I STILL have NO BOOK!I ordered this book on 8/22..it's a month later and there's no sign of it....and no response from the vendor to my inquiries
3,Compelling and manageable read for a non-native speaker,"Length:: 1:20 MinsAs someone who minored in Spanish in college and who doesn't want to lose fluency completely, I read a couple Spanish novels every year. Most recently, I read the brief, entertaining, and insightful Cajas de Cartón. I would recommend it."
5,Excellent intermediate-level Spanish-language read,"An excellent read for an intermediate-level (third-year?) Spanish student. Narration style is straightforward, vocabulary is basic, and story is easy to follow (yet compelling). Highly recommended by this little gabachino."
5,Great Book,"As a student of Spanish, I read the Spanish version, which with a Spanish/English dictionary, was a good reading level for an intermediate Spanish student. In any language this is a great book. It tells the story of the author's life as the child of migrant workers. It relates not only the family's struggles but the great love and strength of the family as as they worked together to survive and obtain a better life. Don't miss the sequel Senderos Fronterizos."
3,Enjoyable to read,"As an intermediate reader in Spanish, I found this book to be easy to read. Each story depicts the life of migrant workers in an entertaining manner. If you are new to reading novels in Spanish then I would highly recommend this book."
5,"A No-frills, Straight to the Point Devotional","After searching a long time to find a devotional just right for me I picked this one up a my local library. Unlike many of the devotional guides I've encountered this one is very direct and doesn't waste a lot of space trying to keep you entertained. It speaks right to the point, without being too blunt or preachy. Althought it's not especially funny it WILL draw you closer to God. If your looking for a real condensed devotional, then this is the book for you; if you want something more lighthearted, try one of Martha Bolton's books. I'm so glad God gave me this book!!!!"
4,Hand of God,"It was awhile back when I recieved this book as a gift. I can't recall who gave it to me, or even why. I do remember it setting on my bedside table and picking it up from time to time. I remember that each time a read one of those short chapters that I understood a little more about God and my personal relationship with Him. I felt closer to Him. I thank God for giving me this book. It was a significant step in my journey."
1,Well.,"I don't get it why wasent it done the Atheist way with science, and logic, and asked for a new locker, by a teacher. At least scientologists would have recruited people to help them."
2,3 Rolls of duct tape and a diaper later,"Well after a long talk with the lord i have decided that this book has been sent from Satan himself. I say this because this book has lead me to adultery, drug use, and worst of all talking to a member of another race. I have since then repented for my sins by wiping myself and praying for forgiveness of my lords clean white male hands that are as soft as a babies booty. I have since then tossed the book in to moredoor to send it back to where it had came from which i can only assume is some where in africa. But other then that it was a ok book."
5,Sealed-beam Flaslight Bulb,"I've had a Big Beam lantern for many years. I accidentally broke the bulb, and couldn't find a replacement locally. Big Beam, which is still in business, ignored an email I sent about where to find one. Then I looked on Amazon, and I had the bulb a few days later."
3,Charming,"Not even back when it was produced this tv series where up to most show's standard. The only exeption is the long, half-paced intro."
2,It not worth it!,"Sexy ladys, cheap comedy. It's not black and white. Actors: Sasha Montenegro, Manuel ""Loco"" Valdes, Lilia Prado, Cuitlahoc Rodríguez and Toño Infante. Year MCMLXXXVIII."
2,"Ok, but nothing special","I really enjoy novels written in old Europe, especially England and London. This was an ok novel to pass the time, but after I finished it, I just kind of shrugged my shoulders. It was somewhat predictable and really didn't develop the characters all that much, not even Ned Warriner. It wasn't a bad book, but neither was it all that good."
3,Good Enough,"I totally dig English history and was excited to jump into this book. The book jacket made it sound as if it would be tough to put down. But it wasn't. I wasn't in a hurry to get to it when I read in bed before I go to sleep - sometimes I began with a magazine. And it didn't leave that ""oh, time for lunch. I get to read my book!"" kind of feeling.The other reviewers nailed it. The research and the period details are good, but the characters aren't fleshed out very well. It turned out to be a slightly absurd plot line, too. It's not likely a book I'll revisit."
1,Not a tight fit,I purchased this product at Walmart to use with our portable dvd players. The plug does not fit snuggly and falls out easily. The part that fits into the cigarette lighter is a great fit. It's the end that attaches to the dvd player that is the problem. I'll be exchaning it for another brand.
1,Doesn't work,"Even after reading the 'not so great reviews' I decided to take a chance on this product because I had one that just quit working after several years of use. Well, I thought my radio was being charged but it was just the batteries that played the radio not the charger. I double checked it on my own vehicle to make sure the cigarette lighter worked. Now it is after the two weeks to return the product and I have a useless piece of junk. I am a mailman who needs to listen to my own radio because the postal trucks do not have them. Batteries get so expensive! Does anyone have any suggestions for a charger that works?"
2,"OK, up to a point","Did what it needed to do. The plastic ring around the cigarette lighter plug part cracked and is now no longer usable. Made cheaply. As long as you don't expect this thing to last a long time, you're probably OK with it."
4,Great sound!!!!,"Very good music! If you hear this music you will remember many movie scenes. Much power in this music. You feel the speed of the action in ""Con Air"". The only two things to object to: 1. only a few change in the music, nearly all tracks sounds like the same, 2. I missed ""Sweet Home Alabama"" on the CD, that would have given a greater feeling of remembering the movie!!! That's why I rate 4 stars for the soundtrack, nothing is really perfect, (except me?! just kidding...)"
2,Only the score - not a soundtrack!,"I had hoped that this CD would contain all the wonderful songs that were in the movie - songs from the '70s, and of course Trisha Yearwood's hit, ""How Can I Live"". I was disappointed to find that the entire CD is instrumental - a score, if you will. Then I tried to find an actual soundtrack, but I don't think one was ever made. Too bad. It would have made great listening."
2,This Sountrack is Average,"Hey, what can you expect from a former rock producer and a guitarist. Con Air is a great soundtrack if you really want to sit down and listen to both heavey and light guitar for an hour (?). If you dislike the guitar songs this album isn't for you. My advice is to borrow the soundtrack from a friend and record Track 8 (The Discharge). This is not the the best Soundtrack I have heard. For its type it is one of the best!"
2,The Cd sucked because the only good song was The Discharge.,"I haven't really grown onto this CD because I don't really like any of the songs except for the Discharge of course because that's when they take out Garland ""The Marietta Mangler"" Greene (played by the very fine actor, Steve Buscemi). The other songs aren't that great but I guess that they are okay. I like the rock music in The Discharge (no particular reason of course). So in conclusion buy the CD but only for the song The Discharge. Thank You. Oh, Yeah no to mention that the pamphlet was nothing but a white piece of paper with only a few credits, NO PICTURES OF STEVE BUSCEMI! so all you Steve fans will be disappointed but you can always buy the movie, so I guess that's the up side to it."
1,"i was very dissapointed, not what i wanted,expected","i was and am very unhappy, with this product i was lookin for the songs that were played by the original artists."
4,"PowerPoint 2000 ""Professional Results"" Delivers","As a professional consultant in the area of presentation design and development, I've learned over the years how easy it is for even very large clients to create very bad presentations. Professional presentation design is an illusive goal for most companies. Finkelstein's book delivers a good balance of thorough, well-illustrated description, pages full of 4-color examples and contributions from professionals in the field, which add a real world perspective to the textbook instructions. It's my experience that most presentation designers only get a handle on a small fraction of PowerPoint's capability. Books like this one will propel you well beyond the basics. I would recommend it highly. (For those not finding a specific download, it's a bit like focusing on the handprints on the glass front door of the Smithsonian - you'll never discover the true value within if you can't get by the small things.)"
2,Terrible company,"The book is fairly well presented considering the magnitude of the program, but there are numerous dense areas where descriptions are difficult to follow, and early on you are led to a download that doesn't exist.It took an obscenely long time for Osborne/McGraw-Hill to answer numerous e-mails about this problem and when they finally did, after some BS about gee we just got your message, provided with a support(?)person who was vague, unresponsive and seemed to think that clever dialogue could make up for lack of service, knowledge and throwing files at a customer that at first didn't work and in fact caused some system problems."
3,Does not tell about the fun things.,"This is a good book for presentations. However, I want to know how to transfer slide shows and such to video, CD's. This book does not even mention that it can be done. I know it can, I've seen it done. I'll keep looking until I find a book that tells how. Not everybody uses PowerPoint just for business."
3,The Skinny,This is another look into the Black Gay community. An interesting video on Gay pride and what it means to be gay in America. I found it held my attention until the end and it left you with a good fuzzie feeling.
3,Why must our movies also turn into PSAs?,"Seeing beautiful black men loving each other is so wonderful (though seeing older black men in love would be even better but that's another story). Seeing this film turn from a fun pride weekend romp to profiling drug abuse, date rape, and a PSA on STD/HIV statistics in the black community while ending so improbably upbeat is baffling to me. I assume the setup is for another film to follow the stories started in this film, because I'll be that much more disappointed if there's not going to be sequel to this film. Hopefully next time there's more story and less PSA."
3,HMMMMMM,It was a good movie. Certain parts were a little over the top and the acting was not all that good..... But for the most part it was good.... sexy characters
3,Expectations Unmet...BUT Not Disappointed,"I enjoyed this movie for the most part. But, from reading the reviews, I think my expectations were too high and they weren't completely met. Not to take anything away from the movie though. The character portrayals are spot on and you can easily this group of friends being ""real"". and encountering these ""real-life"" instances. I think Anthony did extremely well and Jussie Smollett will go far."
3,A good home movie!!,"The film of course is good, but it lack the real true about gay man. I hate watch movie the always put gay down in a bad way. I don't want to see movie that always have gay man using drug, cheating, hunting for sex. Not every gay man live like that."
4,an awesome skinny,Very well written movie. My favorite so far on amazon video. I love P-IP's work. Very realistic. This movie is definitely one to buy.
5,Great swim shirt!,We bought this in the purple and the teal for our 1 year old for wearing throughout the summer. It's very soft and comfortable on her. We ordered it larger than we needed it because we wanted it to be comfy and to fit for as long as possible. It is totally ok to have it big on her. I'd definitely recommend buying one if youre in the market!
3,Pretty Cool,Interesting perspective on the career of Manson and his impact on America from an outside (UK) perspective.
2,2.5 stars? Just so-so for me,My first time reading this author and I can't say it was very exciting or dangerous. I was disappointed actually after reading it compared to what the reviews said. It is NOT a 4 star book for me anyway. It was certainly not a steamy romance book. Not much depth to the characters but it had a good try for the plot or mystery. No surprise to the ending for me. I would not recommend this book unless you got it at a thrift store for $1. or less.
4,"Not a keeper, but worth reading.","Was a pretty decent read. Just got a bit boring toward the end. The chemistry was fun to read. I'm with the reviewer, that stated that the cousin was a pain to read. I hope Ms Smith doesn't write about her in the future. I can see that being a very boring book if that happens. I'm glad I bought this book, it was entertaining. Just not enough to read again. I do love my books that I read over and over again."
2,"Great Idea, BUTTTTTTTT ----",Too many Gizmos in a small space. Hardly enough room to get your foot on the mat. No Gizmos or a larger mat would be the solution.
4,Highly Recommended,"Though it is not noted in the description of this item, this is the New American Standard version of the Bible, Old and New Testament.I have been listening to the tapes during my commute and really enjoy it. The reader is very good and I highly recommend an audio Bible for anyone with a reasonably long commute or just for listening to while working around the house."
5,Did you notice that it is very funny????,Enjoyed this book many years ago and just read it again. It is still very funny. I take it just as seriously as I did Desmond Morris' version of the subject. All good - enjoy.
1,You've got to be kidding!,"The nine reviews I read here about this book are almost as far beyond belief as the book itself. Some reviewers even claim to be anthropology students! None seemed to notice that the Pliocene was actually 3 million years long, a period of climate cooling, and a period from which many homonid fossils have been found; rather than a 12 million year long heat wave from which NO homonid fossils have been found, as presented as the only scientific ""fact"" upon which the book's major conclusions are based. All else is selective, slanted and foggy thought with no actual evidence even pretended by the author.This book belongs on the same shelf as ""Chariot of the Gods,"" another interesting story of entirely possible events presented with extremely questionable evidence. I am sure that ""The Descent of Woman"" makes women feel better, but I am equally sure that it is not a respected ahthropological work and not, as it claims to be, ""the classic study of evolution."""
2,Text offers little if any scientific merit...,"The book was an interesting enough read to keep in my library, but I would not consider it a legitimate argument for the Aquatic Ape Theory - nor, specifically, for the aquatically influenced evolution of the human female and the proceeding ramifications. It approaches the issue in a simplistic, unscientific manner that is not at all convincing. Keeping in mind that this book is dated (having been first published in 1972) could not save it's argument either. The Descent of Woman left just me as I was before and I'll be looking further still for writings on the subject."
5,Love Bites ~ QED,"Love Bites~ QED is a great trance cover of Def leppards classic ballad and this is one intense trance song with great vocals, sounds, beats and it is a must have dance track for parties and gatherings. This is one great track."
1,Not Happy,"I was kind of surprised that the price of this booklet was so high, but I needed it for a course and purchased it. Though it was listed as ""new"" it was far from new -- it was yellow and not what I expected. I was able to return it to the seller. But more amazing was the fact that I was charged a ""re-stocking"" fee. A pretty ridiculous and unfair practice."
2,Incomplete,"It was a big waste of talent. None of the characters are developed..you never feel as you know or care to know them. Too bad. Each actress was doing her best, but it doesn't make up for the poor screen play and direction."
3,Just to add another one of Liza's film to my collection!,"I'm a Liza Minnelli MEGA fan and I had not had the opportunity to watch this movie of hers before, yet I wanted to add the film to my DVD library. Ms Minnelli's performance as ""Cara Varnum"" is fabulous, I also loved the portrayal of the homeless woman ""Mr. Goo"" by Kathy Bates... superb! However, I found the movie a bit boring at times and somehow very long with many senseless parts that do not add to the core of the story. It is just one of those hard to find but gotta have movies! Jennifer Grey's acting in this picture it is just appalling, very hard to believe she is actually Joel Grey's daughter...hummm...one of those occasions that the acting genes did not obviously carry down to the next generation. Liza as usual...one of a kind! Forever LIZA!"
5,Pak up and PLAY!,"The Nintendo DS is basically a miniature laptop computer. In my opinion, that calls for a laptop case to protect my investment. So when I bought the DS for my daughter for Christmas, I also bought a case that looked like it meant business.The DS fits snugly in its padded slot, and there is sufficient room for her six games and wall charger. Additionally, the case comes with a car charger, screen cleaning cloth, couple of extra sylus and game cases. All of this fits nicely into the PlayPak.My daughter likes the look of the case; says it looks like a spy case. It's small enough not to be bulky. It's also easy enough to access that it isn't a hassle to always put her DS safely away.Especially with the extras, like the car charger, I think this case was an excellent bargain!"
3,eh...,"it's cool once you get it. you're all excited to have something new for your ds, but, in truth, the only thing i use in it is the wipe that cleans your screen and the small game cases. other then that, all the other items are pointless. even if i lose my stylus, it came with a two white ones and i have a black ds lite. the thumb stylus sucks and so do the screen protectors. i can't use the car charger and i don't have any gameboy games. so... yeah... pretty pointless."
2,Underwhelmed,I was a little dissappointed when I got the DS lite play pak. It contains a number of items all of which I felt were of limited appeal to me. I guess I just didn't read the item description well enough before ordering. This is my first time to own a DS lite (or a hand held game unit of any kind for that matter) and I guess I didn't know what would be useful and what wouldn't.
2,Basic Pilates,"If you done pilates before, you know these exercies.Just a few warnings about back pain and positions. Good for beginers or people trying to get back into the goove of things."
2,new age stuff,The only pointer I got from this book was that posture and breathing are very important in correcting back and neck problems. These facts reinforced facts already known. Better exercises can be found elsewhere.
4,"Late-night, smoky, sulky romance","Violet Indiana is the new project of Robin Guthrie (ex-cocteau twins) and Siobhan de Mare (ex-mono). This is their second proper album (not counting the USA release ""Casino"" which was a collection of UK EPs and b-sides) after ""Roulette"". Stand out tracks include ""new girl"", ""you"", and ""beyond the furr"" and ""close the world."" The album definitelty benefits from repeated listens and is great late night listening. Violet Indiana is a unique act in this world of homogenized, mass produced music."
2,Another Violet Indiana album I really WANT to like,"Like Casino, I want to like Russian Doll. I like Guthrie and de Mare, but the combo just doesn't work for me. With the exception of ""New Girl"", the tracks are forgettable and over-produced. ""New Girl"" is Robin Guthrie at his best, and Mare is giving it her all, but even as the best track the two artists' styles work against each other. I find myself being distracted from the mood of the music by the pop lyrics, and sometimes Guthrie's wall-of-noise guitar sounds so out of place under the pop melodies. I'd love to hear de Mare backed up by simpler, more pop-ish music and hear Guthrie's guitar work under a more vocally esoteric singer (like Becke Gainforth.)"
5,Milk Inc's best remix!,"Water Music Dance is great at singles, but god awful at compilations (Don't buy any of their comps! They say they're full versions, but their edits. One compilation (Trance Anthems) it faded out every song after 5 minutes. Avoid these).YAY! Milk Inc finally makes it to the states. This isn't their best single and it's a remake, but the Valderan Remix makes ALL the difference. This is a great remix and is filled with energy and extremely euphoric. It greatly improves the song! You have got to get this, especially for the price!"
3,The 'Energy' Future of Civilization,"This book bills itself in the introduction as a ""must read for everyone in America."" I generally don't like such statements but must admit that in this case it is proper. Roy McAlister is a fully credentialed scientist who obviously knows what he is talking about. It is not the best written book by a long shot (thus the 3 star rating) but the content and ideas more than make up the difference. It is a detailed, provocative look at our foolish reliance on fossil fuels and how we can transform our civilization with the use of 'Solar Hydrogen'. McAlister rightly gets into the philosophy as well as the mechanics of using hydrogen fuel. Read this book if you want an insight into what had better be our future energy use. Read this book and discover what you can do to help realise this vision."
4,Music for the move,This is a wonderfull album from James Taylor Quartet. It's a must in the acid jazz field.
4,Sexy Skills,"The best scene in this movie was the one displayed on the cover. I would consider it a porn, but a very soft one. I recommend it..."
1,Boring,"Remembered this from childhood, thought I liked it. Absolutely tedious. Except the one poem he's noted for. That's good. What happened? Why is this book still in print?"
4,Delightful Dictionary,"Amaze your friends, confound your competitors... you're sure to find a half-dozen or so words that are too good not to sprinkle into daily conversation. Gordon's selective dictionary covers the traditional bases by giving definitions and word origins, and using words in sentences, but any similarity to a conventional dictionary ends there (well, it's in alphabetical order, too). It is Gordon's selection of words and phrases and her inspired illustration of their use that make this little book so thoroughly enjoyable. New (to me) words like ""callipygian"" and ""persiflage"" are held up to the light by a variety of eccentric characters and fictional excerpts. Even old favorites and less exotic words are given a fresh coat of varnish in Gordon's baroque treatment. The book ambles, rambles, and diverts itself. A treat for anyone who loves the language. Keep it nearby and browse at random."
3,"Fun, but definitely will appeal to the few","I found this book incredibly entertaining, and I loved Ms. Gordon's hilarious illustrating sentences and mini-stories. It is obvious that she has a true passion for words, in and of themselves. If you share this passion, you will LOVE this book. If you already have a good vocabulary and are interested in increasing it, you will REALLY LIKE this book. If you are struggling with language AT ALL in ANY WAY, this book will confuse you and probably be a total waste of your money. THE DISHEVLED DICTIONARY is a unique and wonderful rollercoaster ride for the senses, but it's a mental workout, too. Make sure you're ready for both."
3,A good intro to Bay Area trip-hop,"Contrary to what the CD's title and liner notes self-proclaim, this complation works best as a trip-hop piece rather than an excursion into true abstract electronica,(see the Mille Plateaux label.)A majority of the tracks are based on downtempo beats and noirish atmosphere. So basically any track with the phattest beat is a winner. Examples are the work by Bugs, Dj Wally & Swingsett and T-Cisco. Unfortunately, much of the music gets bogged down in redundancy, giving me an itchy finger on the ""skip"" button. But overall, compared to its weak sequel, this CD is a nice exhibit of takes on trip-hop."
2,Need better item description..............,"What the description for this item does not tell you is that a 1/2"" drill chuck is required to use the larger size hole saws. I have an assortment of 3/8"" drills that have served me well for many years. There is nothing on or in the packaging that states what size chuck is required. I discovered it the hard way by trying to make 1-3/4 hole using this set and my 3/8"" drill.If I had knwn this hole saw set requires a larger chuck, 1/2"", I would not have pirchased it !!!"
5,No Complaints w/ this Drill Set,"I bought this drill bit set for my OSP team and they haven't given me any complaints yet! We already had some drill bits on hand, just not this size. Dewalt comes through again!"
3,Badmarsh '- Differences,"Arabic beats and breaks on Badmarsh's DIFFERENCES. On ""Tribal Warfare,"" he incorporates a sample that flanged enough to sound almost like a call to prayer, where it's really a call to roll. The title track takes a fat jazz bass and lets it sink into the sound. ""Simply Rolling"" takes a Hindi vocal and tosses it atop a chattering beat, whereas the vocals have a slower backing on ""Goa Funk."" Finally, on ""Let It Roll,"" hints of piano-based Latin jazz sink into the track, giving it a nice groove. Not the same differences here."
5,ProVenture Business Cards,Was very glad to find this out of date software. I love this program and was upset when I lost it due to computer error. It makes the best business cards and is very easy to use. Thanks to the seller for a smooth transaction and a great product.
5,Adorable!!!!!,"I bought this last year. It is just adorable!!!! The butterflies ""twinkle"" in the evening, as if they were flying. I have gotten so many compliments on this. It doesn't project much light, so don't get it to light up an area. It's for decoration only. However, if you are in doubt, get it, you won't be dissappointed.SharonWhite Marsh, MD"
3,Don't expect too many years.,"This was a very nice addition to the backyard solar light display, but only lasted for about four years. Judging by comparison to other products of this type, it seems to bee the standard."
5,Tracks are...,1. It's Only A Papermoon2. Sih-Sah3. Bean's Talking Again4. Bah-U-Bah5. I Surrender Dear6. Sophisticated Lady7. My Blue Heaven8. Honeysuckle Rose9. Organ Grinder's Swing10. Perdido11.

2,Incredible format variety but,"I guess for the price I should not be surprised it is breaking down after 3 months. The dvd region change count is decreasing even though I have never changed it. It starts at 5 and it is now at 2.Also I changed video cards and now can no longer watch commercial dvd movies.Tried all players like power dvd, real player, nero 7, windows media player.They say there is no disk in the drive.I assume this is the same drive as LH-20A1S because there is no model number on this page."
1,Product not as advertised,"Before purchasing this DVD RW drive I carefully searched for drives which could be attached as external drives, and found this one for which the description stated it could be used either externally or internally. When it arrived, though, it was purely an internal drive and turned out to be incompatible with our computer when we attempted to install it internally. Hence, I returned it. Your product return handling was excellent, though, so I am fully satisfied with that part of the transaction."
1,LiteOn 20x SATA DVD/Dual Layer RW Drive (LH20A1S12),"Horrible, Worst product I ever purchased, I need and IDE drive and did not know the difference (I do Now) the seller wanted to charge me a fee to send it back and by that time I would have lost money for buying this horrible product, DON'T BUY!"
4,Excellent drive.,"Positives;1. The default bezel for the drive is black unlike product picture. Comes with beige bezel but you have to attach it yourself.2. It comes with a red sata cable, not L shaped.3. It burns dvd single layer quietly compared to last liteon burner.Negative;1. Comes with really crappy Nero Essentials software that makes you purchase mpeg encoder/decoder.2. Nero software sucks to begin with.3. The manual for the drive is for IDE version and not SATA version."
1,Bad firmware?,"Not recognized by XP Pro SP2 as anything other than a ""CD-Rom drive"". A firmware upgrade (flash program?) from Lite-on, did nothing.It will read media, but won't burn anything."
1,Short Lived,"Amazon had sold this item for $33.27 and it died after 2 months. No warranty,so I was out of luck."
4,Drive is fine,"Works fine...BTW It comes with a black faceplate stock, but also includes an extra white faceplate. FWIW, it's not the drive's fault you have to pay extra to play some video file types... that's a Windoze issue. MS doesn't include the codecs with their OS or WMP."
1,"Regurgitated,voyeuristic and overpriced!","I came across Yes Rasta recently in a Black bookstore while visiting Paris.As an African Jamaican I was immediately attracted to the book based on the title!However,half way in the book I was overcome with immense disappointment.The images are mostly badly exposed and sadly 'déjà vu'.Yes Rasta lacks overall direction and many pages are blank which in my sincere opinion could have benefitted from text-so imperative here,as the photos fail to speak for themselves!Anyone interested in InI livity in book form,I would advise,in conclusion,to save your money and purchase instead Dreads,published by Artisan...trust me,you won't be disappointed!"
4,Good Couples Movie,"My wife and I don't like hard core porn, but we do like tastefully done couples movies as a way to get things started. This one was pretty good and my wife learned a few things which made it good for me."
3,for beginners,"i bought this video and learned 3 or maybe 4 new tricks nto please my husband, the video is defintely for a beginner/amateur."
3,Decline in product quality?,"When I bought these jeans in 2011, they were great. They looked good and have held up amazingly well under rough use over time.In early 2012 I bought two more pairs, expecting the same quality. But this time the buttons inside the waist band that suspenders hook to were missing in one pair and were poorly aligned in the other pair. And even though both pairs were the same size, one pair fit as though they were a size smaller than the other. I hope the quality issues with my most recent purchase were a fluke and not a trend."
3,Fine it you wear boxers,"The pants are well made and true to size.The gusseted crotch does work well when you crotch down however, the extra seams for the gusset rubbed my inner thighs almost raw because of the extra material. They would probably be fine if you wear boxers but I'm a brief kinda guy."
2,Too large for skinny person,"I liked the style and apparent toughness of the jeans, but they were wayyyyy too baggy on me, despite the 33"" waist and 30"" length fitting properly. I'm 5'-8"" and 160lbs, so I'm skinny, but not overly so. These pants are only appropriate for thicker people. I returned these and found the Wrangler Classic Fit and Regular Fit to fit properly, but not so with any of their carpentry pants. Disappointing."
5,Wow great DVD,"This is a great DVD it includes the first 25 episodes of the incredibly good yu yu hakusho series. It is also better than buying the DVD's seperately, because that would cost [a lot of money]. It includes the new apprentice saga, the beasts of maze castle, rescue yukina, and the three artifacts of darkness."
5,A great beginning to a great anime.,"it's a little slow in the beginning, but totally worth it. the next sagas are much more fast paced and interesting, like the Dark Tournament is kinda like the martial arts tournament in DBZ. kinda.but the beginning is necessary for understanding the whole story line. this is a better deal than buying the dvds separately.the characters are well developed and not only age over time, but change and grow emotionally as well. it's not just a fighting or adventure anime, there is some serious themes woven in as well.overall it's exciting and hilarious...a must see for all ages."
5,How to tell cut from uncut,"Listen up folks, the general rule of thumb here at Amazon, it seems, regarding ratings is that in the item description box if it is listed as unrated it is uncut whereas the cut episodes are rated as ""G"".Great anime, love the series and the Manga--everyone reading this has got to check out Shonen Jump (at any supermarket, K-Mart etc.) to see it how Yoshihiro Togashi intended it! and it's good to see some other YYH caliber stuff, too.This uncut box set is definetly recommended. There isn't really any straight forward inuendo or nudity or anything just mild swearing B***h, D**n, H**l, a*s and so on, and the violence which is in the other anyway, but I digress..."
2,Misleading Title,"Although this book is supposed to be about the neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen in NYC, it frequently veers off topic into long stretches about the Tenderloin (about which much has already been written), the police force, Father Duffy's stint in the armed forces, etc. When the book does stay on topic, it is quite good. But Hell's Kitchen the neighborhood too often seems like an afterthought."
1,"Wrong, Wrong, Wrong, Wrong","This book is just plain wrong -- no interviews with Warren were conducted, Mair used conjecture to fill in gaps, and most of the book really doesn't even have anything to do with Warren.And most troubling is the fact that where Mair DOES talk about Warren, he makes mistakes all over the place.How do I know??? Because I have attended Saddleback Church for nearly 10 years, know Rick Warren personally, have listened to hundreds of his sermons, and I have even had dinner with not only he and his wife, but his father, Jimmy.Believe me, this book is no biography of Rick Warren. Pass on it, and wait for an authorized bio."
3,A little on the Light side.,"This is a difficult book to review. While being fairly well written, A PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE doesn't really explain much about the subject, Rick Warren. I was hoping to find something out about Warren's leadership techniques and ""team-building"" methods, if you will, but found very little. In fact, I really don't know much more about Rick Warren now than I did before I read this book.The author certainly gives high praise for his subject, touting accomplishments on virtually every page, but that's about as far as it goes. Overall, a dissappointment."
2,Not Much About the Man - Mostly About the Church Growth,"The top of the book cover says ""The story of the man behind the Purpose-Driven Life. Well, sort of. As you read this book you get the idea that the author never got an interview with Rick Warren and had to find something besides biographical details to fill the pages.The resulting book is really an overview of the Church Growth Movement in North America. I was surprised to find that there is almost as much biographical information about Robert Schuller as about Rick Warren.The examination of principles of church growth will be interesting to many readers. They will also appreciate Mair's indepth look at growth programs at Saddleback Community Church.But if you're looking for an intimate look into the spiritual growth of Rick Warren and stories of God's guiding hand in his ministry, you will be disappointed. The bulk of the biographical information about Rick Warren can be found on pages 33-35, 49-55, and 68-78."
1,Deceptive Shoes,The product sent was not as depicted. One model was shown on site and an entirely different model was delivered. I have vowed never to order shoes on line again.
2,Yellow handle /Case Peanut Pocket Knife,"I was not completely satisfied with this product. I have been purchasing Case pocket knives for over 20 years and I have always been satisfied with the quality of Case Knives. I love the style of this particular knife. I have two others just like it with different handle material. This knife has a hair line crack on both sides of the knife where the handles are attached to the sides of the knife. This is the first time that I have purchased a Case knife that was not excellent quality. I was sent a second knife to replace the one that I purchased and it also had the same defect. I must say that I was disappointed. Thanks, for asking my opinion. William J. Wells, Case knife collector."
5,DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS,"I have used this tuner in many different places and ways, from tuning classical nylon string guitars using the built in mic to plugging in a guitar chord from acoustic electric (NYLON string) through regular metal string electrics (recommended using input jack in noisy situations without hiding in silence somewhere- often hard to do).The fact that this tuner uses little lights instead of a phoney needle meter done with LED displays makes it much more useful in low light siturations and very easy to read. When it hits green you are in tune. If you want to tune down or up a step, no problem either. Just watch the little lights.All around an excellent tuner for both bass and guitar, very versatile and as much as you would want to spend. It is very durable and has taken more than its share of hard living.Highly recommended."
5,An excellant product!,"The content is expansive and fully-integrated. There is a tremondenous amount of material that is logically organized and quick to access. The software is so simple and intuitive you can really get right into it and use it right away without any instructions. It also has some very elegant touches that includes color illustrations and liturgical music clips that enhance the feel of using the program and at the same time has several useful features that allow you to efficiently cross-reference documents, cut and paste, and book mark. It's just a plain good product."
5,pleased with this resource,This resource is extremely helpful for study purposes. We will put it into our library of Catholic resources that we are now building.
4,awsome prezels,i got this product for my grandson and he loved them but the reason why I rated it a 4 because they were to salty
2,Not an easy read,"Ok I got this cause Richard Brautigan was mentioned in a song I like , I didn't know who he was- looked him up -tried him out. Can't say I'm crazy about him. His shortstorys seem rather pointless, though they did elicit an occasional chuckle. Frankly I'm still working on this. I read a story or two between novels, can't take much more than that at a time. I'm not a deep thinker so could be I'm missing all kinds of metaphors and symbolism and what have you so give it a go if you think you will see stuff like that, and like it! What the hell it's cheap and like I said not a complete loss several of them I have liked a couple made me think WTH??"
5,Purely amazing,every word Brautigan pens is pure beauty. I really don't know how anyone can truely live without reading at least one of his stories if not every thing you can get your hands on. Brautigan is pure and utter genius. Too bad he had to kill himself........
1,So totally overblown,"This guy's is so completely overrated. It's cut-rate stuff, it rings false, it's precious and silly and utterly dull writing. If you really get into this kind of thing, you'd probably be better served to go back to some of the better Tom Robbins material, who, though he's cloying (and can be awfully irritating), at least does this kind of thing more artfully. This is everything that's bogus and annoying about latter-20th-Century California 'Literature.'Ugh."
1,Do not order Kindle edition,"I love Richard Brautigan's work. Don't go anywhere near the Kindle edition if you're sensitive to proofing errors.I read the Kindle edition (via Overdrive) and noted a bunch of errors in the Revenge of the Lawn stories before I quit in frustration at 8%:* The; classrooms - in ""Elmira""* place for mc to hunt - in ""Elmira""* I won't She left the kitchen. - in ""Coffee""* Cup ""of coffee - in ""Coffee""* Take your head cut of your - in ""The Lost Chapters of Trout Fishing in America""* At tie poor -- in ""The Lost Chapters of Trout Fishing in America""* Picnic basket? - in ""The Lost Chapters of Trout Fishing in America""* Mu:h meat. - in ""The Weather in San Francisco""* ""I don't wan: any - in ""The Weather in San Francisco""I was appalled by the quality of what I saw...it looked like they did an OCR scan and skipped even a basic spellcheck. Let alone having anyone actually proofreading."
3,don't bother with re-hashing!,"nothing can surpass the greatness of Soilwork's ""chainheart machine"" album....the best riffage, the most AMAZING solos and the album is chalk full of them...in my opinion, the chainheart machine is THE pinnacle of Melodic death metal. do not bother with this Duskfall stuff, it is just rehashing, and who wants the same album written by a different band...not too original...but if that is the style you are obsessed with, by all means, go ahead and waste your money on the same damn ride you have been on 100s of times before..."
4,Hot Rods by Boyd,"A well-illustrated, well written ""his life and work"", of arguably the most accomplished custom car builder in the US today. Showcases his best known and lesser known projects, plus some work in prgress at the time of publication. A must for custom car aficionados anywhere."
3,Elven Gardeners,"This is another book about communicating with nature spirits. It's less insightful than Summer with the Leprechauns, and focused more on agriculture than general working. Many things about it remind me of the Perelandra books, which I review elsewhere.These elves speak in vernacular, which is somewhat disconcerting, and they lead the author on an agricultural journey, teaching her how to work with nature spirits to increase plant health and productivity. In many ways this book is much like the Findhorn work as well, but less spontaneous and fresh. The focus is more on ecology and biodiversity, and in reading it I had the sense the elves were just tossed in to make the book more readable. While I didn't object to anything they ""said,"" they sounded very human to me.If you're really into gardening and sustainable agriculture and want to hear what ""elves"" say about it, get this book. Otherwise, there are others that are more highly recommended."
1,Don't be duped,"Self-styled ""scientists"" have been creating an artificial fluoride controversy for years in order to cash in on the hysteria that they generate. These people create a demand for their services by preying on the fear of the unknown, and market themselves on ""lecture circuits"" where they receive thousands of dollars per lecture to speak about either a ""conspiracy"" or a ""failure on the part of the scientific community""; neither of which, in fact, exist."
5,Must reading for all Americans-especially dentists,"This scientific, well researched book reads like a detective story!I couldn't put it down! This book reveals the terrible deception and fraud that heads of state,industry and the scientific community have perpetuated on the innocent public, much to the detriment of the health of the American people. This book should be required reading for every doctor and dentist before their license is granted and for every parent when the birth certificate for their child in issued. This book could bring about real changes in America for the betterment of the health of the people. For your own good, do read it!"
5,Just One More Drain on the Taxpayer ... >,"in any scientific arguement, the only thing that matters is the available evidence and that is clearly lacking at the CDC. It's been said that when the data doesn't support your arguement you don't have enough data. The gov't is renowned by flubbing its own studies, sponsoring stupid programs with no basis in fact, and draining the taxpayer just to create a jobs program. Enough!! Even WITHOUT all the nobel-leareates against it, I cannot condone the adding of nutrients, vitamins, minerals, fluoride, or green tea to public water at taxpayer expense. I can take care of my own teeth, thank you very much."
3,This is a silly book....,"This is a silly book, about a silly story, about what may even be, quite a silly country. Perhaps you should read it to find out why. Well done, Farley. Obviously not one of your best, yet it had to be written anyway, I suppose..."
5,Spanktasticly Sound!,"Of all of DJ WAllY albums available, this collaberation with DJ Swingsett is the most out there. It feels more like Pink Floyd meets Tito Puente on mescaline, all with a taste of drum and bass. All the tracks are different, they flow together fluidly and even sound strangly familliar. Definatly worth checking out.."
3,Drill bit broke on first use...,"I was drilling a hole in an electrical panel (thin metal) with this the day after I received them and the drill bit just snapped. No major torque or anything, it just snapped. I will be contacting them for a replacement, but I am disappointed in the quality of the bit. Overall kit is nice, just disappointing to have it break on first use doing something it was designed to do."
3,Dewalt Hole Saw,"The actual hole saws work great. I am a home owner and needed to get a couple holes from inside to outside. They work fast and are sharp. I have stucco so I was careful in not running the saw into the stucco. I was able to work from the inside out. The only qualms I have with the kit, and the reason for losing a star or two, are there was a broken plastic piece holding one of the saws in place that was broken and one of the plastic pieces holding one of the chucks was broken in multiple places."
4,Hole Saw,"This is a great little kit. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 start is if you use them enough, like for a living they will eventually have to be replaced. I use them quite a bit and they work wonderfully. With this type of tool you use it in excess then you will at some point have to buy new ones. Dewalt is also a very good company to work with when you are looking for better tools. Good Product."
2,Great sound but issues with cable connector,I have always been a big fan of Denon products. These in ear headphones have great sound but after about one year the connection from the cable to the silver connector came loose and the sound disappeared from one channel. Fortunately it was under warrently and they sent me a new pair. About 15 months later the same thing happened to that pair. I called Denon and although it was past warranty they did not hesitate in telling me to send them back and they would get out another pair. I am greatful but I am not sure how long they will allow that if this keeps happening. I realize that that connector is exposed to flexing at that point when inserted into a pocket or worn when working out but I am a fairly fastidious person when it comes to caring for things like this. So I don't think I am being negligent or abusive. I wonder if it's a design flaw or something that inevitably happens to any headphone after a year or so.
3,Eh...,I'm kinda disappointed because these are the earbuds I chose after several months of research. I guess I'm not putting them in correctly because I can't get much bass out of them no matter how well I seat them. Might take some EQ work which is not an option on my shuffle. =(
5,A MYSTERY THAT KEEPS YOUR ATTENTION!,"I'm always attracted to mysteries featuring some kind of book plot and this one was intriguing. Very likeable characters. Even if you guess the plot, it makes little difference as there is pleasure in the story and characters themselves. It made me look for other of her books and hope that there were more -- or will be -- of Rona Parrish."
2,There are better alternatives out there!,Have suffered with this program for two years. Much too complicated. Frustration is off the scale. Too many shortcomings
5,Christian Lacroix Bazar summer fragrance,"This perfume is hard to find as it went out of production I believe, a few years ago. I was pleasantly surprised by the low price and very pleased with the delivery terms (fast service and reasonable postage costs). For me this was a real bargain."
3,Tool kit,"The tools were nice, but the case had a broken latch so I can't give it as a gift as I had planned. I guess I could have returned it, but what a pain."
2,Not Built to Last,"I purchased this product since I was looking for an affordable but comprehensive drill bit set. I was immediately disappointed by the plastic case which makes taking bits out of the slots very difficult and putting them back in to their slots even more difficult. The oxide drill bits flex/wobble so much during drilling that it will make your drill vibrate in an unsafe manner. The titanium bits are stiffer but I already had 2 break spontaneously. The case also does a poor job of keeping pieces in the place. Every time I open the case after neatly stowing each piece in it's proper place, I find that many pieces are jostling around freely. I'm not happy with this purchase and will try to return it for the quality issues listed here."
5,Denali Contractor's Drill Bit Set,This is a very nice set with a rugged case. It comes with a variety of different bits that prove very useful in construction jobs. I am pleased with the quality and would recommend this set to others. Bits seem to be pretty strong and aren't cheap chimpsy material that breaks easily. Overall GREAT set for the money!!!
5,"Great tools for the price!, Really great!",Denali must have stepped up their QA since all the negative comments because I have a rock solid set that the rest of my work crew is envious about. Great quality for the price. Heck Great quality if it were triple the cost.
2,Not so good,"No drivers for square drive screws, lots of drivers for things I never use. The drill bits I can use in my compact driver/drill are not titanium.The storage trays are pure junk, and they hold a number of items. That's why things fall out of the container. I highly recommend this item to people who don't do much.edit; I found a couple of square drives in one of the cheap boxes that keep falling out as you open the container. There is no way to tranfer them to one of the more prominent places in the carrier. The drill bits with driver bases are pure junk.So for me, everything I wanted out of the set is unsatisfactory."
4,Bang for the buck,"Overall its a nice set. It is replacing my old Black & Decker bit set. In comparing the build of the set, the Denali is made better. I took some small drill bits from each set and saw how easy it was to bend the bits using minimal force as to not destroy the part. The B&D parts bent a little easier and even feel poorer. I would call the Denali set hardcore but it is of average to slightly above average. For the price and the size of the set, I don't think it can be beat. It was between this and the Hitachi 72 piece set, and I decided on this and have no complaints. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wouldn't call it perfect. But then again I do believe you get a little more than you pay for."
4,Does the Job,"I have bought piecemeal several screw bits, drills, nut drivers, etc but am constantly looking for them. With this kit I have everything in one place. Although I have not had it long nor used all of the pieces in the kit, what I have used got the job done. I find the steel in not of high quality but for the average job around the house it gets the job done. So if you are looking for an inexpensive kit and not using it on the job on a daily basis, this works fine."
4,Denali Titanium 136-Piece drill/drive set,"Quality is good except for the smaller diameter drill bits, they break easily. Good price, I would buy it again if I had to do it over."
2,Weak,"Guitar is chunky & groovy, but the vocals are so weak, they ruin the record. Totally without soul. The record sounds like a bunch of white guys who studied and learned to play funk, but never got any instruction on soulful singing. If they ever make an instrumental record, I'll buy it."
2,Game Over???,"This isn't ""Aliens"" so why is he using that quote to dismiss his students. I'd rather stick to watching Marathons of America's Top Model. This show's worse than ""Rock of Love"".The only reason I'm giving it a 2 is because his strategies do have point. But, take the strategy away from the show and there's nothing to watch here, folks."
4,Spirited Performances,"This is an excellent set with snappy performances of some of the great Masonic choruses. The best is still the oldBernhard Paumgartner Mozarteum LP (Epic) which I'm not sure was ever was on CD. Paumgartner's Laut verkundeis much more exciting than Maag's. But still in most ways the Maag is superior to the Istvan Kertezs set, so if one wanted a good CD of the music this might be the one."

4,"Very Good, but some great matches were left out","This was a comprehensive look at The Undertakers career in the WWE. Some great matches where left out, like THE BOILER ROOM BRAWL@SUMMERSLAM, and UndertakervsUndertaker in 1994, and Undertaker vs. The executioner. Those matches should have made it in and some of the more recent matches should have been left out. Otherwise, It is a very good dvd and I watch it a few times here and now."
4,"All wrestling, no documentary","This set is the complete opposite of the Bret Hart set. While the Hitman's set was stronger on the documentary side than the wrestling side, the Undertaker set has no biographical content at all. There is nothing on Mark Calloway, the real man behing the Undertaker character, which is a shame. Being that he has done such a good job with this character, the least the WWE could have done was give him some air time on his own DVD. With that said, if you want pure wrestling, this is a good set, especially at the sale price (19.95). I am told that ""This is My Yard"" (2001) is better if you want to learn more about Mark Calloway, though I cannot vouch for it personally. Overall, this set was worth the price I paid, but I will be happier when a more complete set is released."
4,It didn't do Mark Callaway the justice he deserved,"I have been a fan of Mark's since he was part of The Skyscrapers in WCW and I have a huge collection of Undertakers stuff and will remain a fan forever. I purchased the Ric Flair set and was impressed. Taker's set was bad packaging, no one on one interviews with superstars and NOT even ONE personal interview with Mark or his wife Sara. I felt the matches picked were excellent BUT this set lacked the power that Flair's did. The way the discs are stacked on top of each other is CHEAP and the artwork is just plain. BOY WWE especially Vince....this is the way you show respect to THE MAN who never left your company and fought thru pain and other things to make your company money....two words to you Vince...""YOU'RE FIRED!"""
3,MY VIEW,I thought this was a pretty good set some stuff i havent yet to see like the ground zero match great match so all in all a great set i wish they would put out a best of Y2J or kurt angle
2,Nothing but Matches,"If you want to watch a bunch of the Undertakers best matches then this is a good DVD. If you want to learn anything of the history of the Undertaker, either the man or the character you won't get any of that here. This is bascially a bunch of matches with a little voice over in between, similar to the Ric Flair DVD (but without the great promos as Taker isn't exactly one of wrestlings great speakers, nor is Paul Bearer for that mater lol). This DVD has no vignette with interviews with the wrestler or history of the character from McMahon and company whatsover (unlike the Bret Hart, Hogan and Warrior DVD's). Furthermore the cover art is horrible and all of the discs are all stuffed into one side of the box (as opposed to it opening up to several DVD flaps with picture art (e.g. Flair and Hart DVD's). If you are a wrestling purist then it is okay, else wait for the inevitable second 5 or 6 disc DVD WWE will release when he retires in a year or two."
5,awesome,I really liked the movie. I bought it for my sister. It was a Christmas present. She was really happy.
5,AWESOME!,"this is possibly the greatest edvd ever. The only bad part is only the packaging, but it is extremely great"
4,"Great dvd, but misses greates matches.","The undertaker have to many important and great matches but don't show all, however i think the wwe want to release part II of the history of the undertaker."
2,This is how you repay the phenom??,"The Undertaker, one of Vince McMahons MOST LOYAL Wrestlers. Mark Callaway deserved much more of a history then what they gave him. But if I go that far than so does Hulk Hogan (Hulk Still Rules could have been longer). They also Rushed through the casing and put them all stacked on top of eachother, Ric Flair got something of a box set. I just think that this dvd was another RUSHED through biography, just like Andre the Giant's dvd they could have done so much more with it too! Let me go before I get too frustrated with WWE's antics...."
5,"good price, fast shipping.","I got these for my wife who does not like the liquid version, the pills work very well if you don't like to drink the cider."
1,product seems to be worthless,"after soaking my carburetor( for 3 hours ) this stuff did not clean any part of it. even the old gasket did not get soft and had to be scraped off. this is not the old carb cleaner that use to be ,does not look or smell as the old type. dont wast your money."
1,This stuff is TERRIBLE,"New stuff is TERRIBLE, leaves a yellow residue that hardens when it dries on the carb parts clogging passages and jets. Switched to the equivalent berryman carb cleaner dip, not going back."
5,What an Experience of Baroque Music,"A couple of years ago I first saw Wang playing cello in Isaac Stern's 1979 award winning documentary ""From Mao to Mozart"". He was 9 years old then and he had already impressed my by his passion to music. Ever since then, I have been looking for his CD and hoping to hear his new performances as a young musician. Now, this Baroque album has really demonstrated Wang's maturity. He still plays with passion, but more in a sense of caring as soloist.The combination of Boccherini and Couperin make this CD a real Baroque experience. I also like Monn's Concerto for cello, strings and harpsichord. Wang plays especially well in the second movement."
3,Dorothy wore blue socks,"The shoes were fine but it always annoys me that people never seem to notice that Dorothy wore BLUE socks, not white. Watch the movie, her socks are blue."
2,Wrong size,"The shoes aren't of bad quality, but I ordered medium, and the packaging said medium, but the shoes themselves were large."
2,Wrong size,I read the reviews they said they run big but they don't i had to return these for another larger pair. The shoes are of good quality though.
1,Returned item,"I purchased item and it was shippped promptly, cute item and would have kept but they were too big - said 9/10 I am a 9 but way too big could not have worn without falling out of them. I paid over $30.00 for the item. I never wore them put them right back into the bag they came in. I just recieved email saying I was only going to get 50% credit. I sent back in the bag and in the orignal box they came in. Don't understand how and why they say they were damaged or not in orignal container as it states in the policy. No place to comment back. Am contemplating not using Amazon anymore. Once burned - that is enough for me. Thought Amazon was different than others, but now shows they are going the same path. This is the first time I have had an issue with any of my purchases and I purchase on a regular basis."
1,extremely disappointed,"We bought this by the picture thinking these were the perfect dorothy shoes. They were over-sized and hooker like.We tried to return them the day we got them, but our email was not answered. Threw them in the halloween costume box.Don't waste your money. Go to payless and just buy some red shoes."
3,Beautiful shoes BUT WAY TOO SMALL,Ordered size small 3/4 but they look more like a toddler 9/10 . I believe size may be by age for child. They are adorable shoes. Too bad they were too small.
1,Collection of sermons Marc has heard over the years,This brief book gives an overview of the prophetic movement of the past 25 years. Marc suggests that we should focus in on the Apostlic Movement. With little reason given and lots of speculation this book lacks an authoriative touch.
5,AMY BEACH RE-DISCOVERED!,"I ""discovered"" Amy Marcy Cheney Beach's music quite by accident in graduate school, and an older professor dug in his piles of music and found ONE piece ""Canticle of the Sun"" - and I was bowled over by its power and unique-ness. I tried to order some anthems of hers for my choir, but all were out of print. Recently I discovered Ms. Block's book on the composer and read it - cover to cover. It stated at the end that her works were being revived! I looked on Amazon.com and found serveral CDs. I ordered them all. Her music is fabulous, accesible, virtuostic, well-written and a FRESH approach to late romantic - an approach I have not heard before and that I love. HIGHLY REOMMENDED. (Note to the woman who called this ""outdated"" - I feel no beautiful and artistic expression has any sort of DATE, and feel this to be a limited and perhaps academic point of view.)"
5,Excellent book on the Soviet Navy,Wow. That is the only thing I could say when I started looking at this book. It totally exceeded my expectations. I bought it for a list of Soviet ships during the cold war and hopefully some info on Soviet bases for a research project I am working on. This totally blew my mind.The book has 34 chapters and 4 appendixes with Flags and Insignia appendix being the only one in color. Below is a list of some chapters.Personnel and TrainingFleet DevelopmentSubmarinesAircraft CarriersCruisersDestroyersFrigatesNaval AircraftNaval WeaponsNaval ElectronicsBases and PortsFishing FleetThere are hundreds of photographs and it is loaded with diagram and data on every ship the Soviet Navy ever had. A must have for anyone interested in this subject. Well worth the price.
2,Entry level knife,"I recently got two of these knifes, and several others of different brand, thru a safety program at work. I like the appearance and general shape of the blade. Handle fits my hand nicely. The sheath is kind of cheesy in my opinion. My main concern is the blades of both knives are badly rolled over. I mean REALLY ROLLED OVER. Not what I expected from Case. Granted this knife isn't the most expensive you can buy, but this is a workmanship issue that really shouldn't have been. Not from Case. 2 stars."
1,Buying an item blindly,"The ad for the item got my attention, the description of the item was pretty good, but my imagination can only take me so far and the like the saying goes a picture is worth a thousand words. I tried to find something that I could click to to the view the item clearly, but there was none. My suggestion is a clear color picture. That's is why you lost this sale. Thank you."
5,Leapster Book: Thomas the Tank Calling All Engines,Item purchased for grandson. At 4 1/2 he finds it very enjoyable.
4,Great for little ones who want to be independent,"My four year old is able to navigate and learn with very little assistance from Mom & Dad with set up or play. At first, we had to force him to allow us to assist him as we ensured he was truly grasping the learning skill. It explained everything to him and he was able to be independent."
3,Doesn't hold interest,My two girls enjoy this game for very short periods of time. They don't get as into it as they do other games and we LOVE Thomas. I was surprised.
4,Great first game.,"My three year old is a bit young for the Leapster, but Thomas is a familiar character to him and so he loves it quite a bit. I have watched him play and am confident he will grow into this game in a matter of months. And it's better than him playing the gameboy. He really wants to learn his letters and numbers now. And though he has had this game less than a month, he already recognizes the numbers 3 and 5. It's a start and I am happy he is learning in a way he likes. He does have a little trouble with the pen/stylus because sometimes you have to press a small button on the pen along with touching it to the screen."
3,Calling All Engines Good For Very Young,We purchased the leapfrog and three games for a 4 1/2 year old. He played this game a few times then quickly outgrew it in favor of the Diego and Cars games. This game is very basic and did not challenge him in any way. It would be good for a 3-4 year old who has not used a computer or any game before. I do not recommend this game for a child five or older.
5,perfect,My 5 year old loves this game! I was told by the seller that it would work on the Leapster 2 and he was correct. My son loves Thomas and this is a great learning game for him.
5,Terrific cartridge.,"My three year old son loves this cartridge, and has a leapster in his hand most of the day with Thomas the Train going. I just have to change batteries once in awhile!Terrific toy!"
3,ENJOYABLE READ!,"I'm a straight woman who found this book quite compelling. As a matter of fact, I abandoned Jonathan Frazen's totally boring THE CORRECTIONS in favor of SWEET DESIRE and thought it was a good decision.The book zips along and I couldn't wait to find out how the predictable ending would be carried out. I particularly liked the loving community of women and the enchanting Nicole. Enjoy!"
3,You'll Need much more to pass the exam than this book,"This book gives you a basic idea of what the exam is going to cover, but the exam questions and the ease in which you answer them may give you false send of security. The book is very lean on Defining Technical architecture and Managing Access to FP and really assumes that u know a great deal about NT, Unix and how to configure these. If u know about these then you're in great shape. I also read Running Front Page 98 (RFP)by Jim Buyens besides this book.Because I don't have a good background in IT, I decided to sample the Transcender Exam and bought the tests. In my opinion, you definitely need the Transcender Tests. Studying the transcender answers really cuts through the walls of words in RFP and the holes in this book."
3,Ok as study material. Not good enough for the exam.,"It is ok to start with this book for the exam preparation. But do not expect to successfully complete the exam just with this book. The book does not cover a considerable number of topics that are part of the exam. The book tends to repeat a few pieces of information, such as Active-X controls being supported only by Internet Explorer, over and over again. A couple of chapters in the book do not appear anywhere in the list of examination objectives as published in Microsoft certification website. The practice/live test on the accompanying CD is not at all good. It is mostly just a repetition of the chapter-end review questions. The actual test is much tougher than the practice/live test on the CD."
2,Errors,"With the fact that you are relying on this as a test study guide, it is frustrating to weed through errors on the on the cd and in the self-tests answers."
2,Practice Exams on CD-ROM are not reprentative,"I've used Frontpage98 for two years and decided to take the exam. I studied this book for two weeks and was scoring 98 percent on the CD-ROM practice exam. I took exam 70-055 and failed with a 680 out of the possible 1000. The practice exam is far to easy, and gives the false impression that you are ready for the exam. I would suggest that they not even include it."
3,"Great book, terrible practice tests","This book did a great job of thoroughly explaining the subject matter. The book outline exactly matched the order of the objectives that Microsoft lays out on their web page. However, the book was too long and much of the information was duplicated in various chapters. Just a scattering of typos. The only major problem with the book are the practice tests on the cd. The answers on the online exams do not match the answers in the reading material or in the practice exams at the end of each chapter. You can get a 100% on every end of chapter test and then take the full test on the cd (which uses the EXACT same questions) and get a 70%. TIP: Read the book to prepare, DO NOT use the test engine on the cd...rather get another proven testing tool. Good luck!!"
5,Outstanding Book,I just passed the exam on 4/24/99 after using this book to study for three weeks. I highly recommend the book as a primary resouce. I also used the exam cram book from Certification Insider Press as a supplemental resource.
1,wow,this is the worst site in the world . Ive been waitin for a month and a half and no video...... they just keep posponing it... hmmmmm looks like iam not the only one......
3,"Early Mingus, if you're curious","This CD has some of the early recording of Charles Mingus, back when he was sometimes known as 'Baron'. The songs have a variety of lineups, and some feature vocalists. The title track is a catchy enough song, though at 2:55 there isn't much time for soloing or improvisation. The other thing is that the players aren't 'A' list. The biggest names are saxophonist Buddy Collette, Britt Woodman, who played trombone with Duke Ellington, Lucky Thompson, who played sax on Miles Davis' ""Walkin'"", and vibist Cal Tjader, who plays on two songs. ""Weird Nightmare"" and ""Baby Take A Chance With Me"" are nice vocal songs. ""Mingus Fingers"" features some hot bass playing, and ""Boppin' In Boston"" ends it nicely. A lot of the other songs are okay, but simply slower-paced songs of their late '40's era. This CD is of most interest to big-time Mingus fans and people who like the pre-bebop style of jazz."
3,"Good program, not enough direction.","I consider this program worth buying, but with the caveat that it has almost no directions (at least mine didn't) and I spent some time just trying to figure out how to get it to produce the printed/faxed apprearance I wanted. If you're good at figuring things out or just have a little time to spend getting to know the software, it's not bad.Here are some things it does that I did like:-Easy to fax through on-line fax service-Keeps running tab of paid/unpaid invoices for each client-Doesn't require that you open different files--it's all there together.Suggestion to manufacturer: include tutorial or handbook."
4,Carlos Proventure Review,"The Item is very good has helped my secretary keep good records, I recomend that people use this item to keep good track of incoices. Please I need some help I have difficulty backing up the files. I follow the instructions and it seems that the file has been backed up but when I try to open the flopy in an other computger I get an error "" file can not be opend %SPE not found, ThanksCarlos"
5,Interpreting the DSS Damascus Document,"While working to ""produce history"" Maxine Grossman of the University of Pennsylvania reads the Damascus Document via a literary critical perspective (ix). She believes she is offering an ""alternative approach"" to historiography because textual meanings do change over time(""never are complete"" xi) and according to the sectarians who wrote and interpreted themselves as fulfillments of the Hebrew Bible their ""history"" was as much an ""ideology and not simply statements of facts"" x). Her book ,is in other words, a how to interprete the DD.That is, if we want to have a methodological hermeneutical approach to this Dead Sea scroll document then we have found it."
3,Horrible Recording,"The recording is poor. The signing comes out well, but the symphony is drowned out and muted. Hopefully the next one will be better. This is not his fault but whoever produced the recording of the DVD. He sounds so much better on CD."
2,Sound editing/mixing extremely bad,"I've long been a Watson fan and have put off getting any of his live DVDs until now. While the quality of the sound mixing sounds fine on the first track, the rest of the performance has to be some of the worst sound mixing I've heard. At one point you begin to hear some feeback from the stage monitors!While the vocals can be heard fine, and clear, the orchestra ranges from being hardly heard to sounding just plain muddled. Not only is this annoying, it's just plain unacceptable.If you're a Watson fan who thinks he can do no wrong, you'll probably be happy with this. There are lots of places where he shows off some personality. If you appreciate fine sounding classical audio this will drive you nuts."
2,A Non-working Wall Hanging Only,"I was a bit disappointed in this, hoping for something with a little more weight and solidity to it. It's nothing more than a piece of plastic, punched into a clock shape. No, it does not work, the hands are printed on the plastic. For the collector, it's passable as long as one merely looks at it from a distance. Touching it would spoil any illusion..."
1,Cheap quality!!,"This is a very cheaply made product. I used this for my 3 yr. old for Halloween. It barely made it through the night because it was so flimsy.It's made out of a very thin plastic. Also, the chain kept coming apart."
1,Disappointed,"I have to say I was disappointed with this purchase. First of all, the product came to me in the mail smashed. I was able to pop the heart back into shape, but the plastic was marked from being smashed. Secondly, there was no back to the heart. It is not a full hollow plastic heart as it appears to be. From the front it looks great. From the back, it's just the white shell of the front piece. The chain was very flimsy. I was mostly disappointed that it wasn't packaged properly and came smashed."
3,Woodman's heart,"The product was shipped quickly, is very attractive, and arrived in good shape. It ia made of a thin plastic. I wish it was more durable."
3,It is what it is.,Not sure what I was expecting but it will do. Doing a retreat with the Oz theme and one of us is dressing as the Tin Man so it will be a nice accent.
3,It's okay,I only needed it for halloween but buyers should know it's only a 2- dimensional shell of a clock made with the thinnest plastic.
1,Boo...,This is a thin piece of plastic that should be sold at the dollar store not for nearly $10... DO NOT BUY!!!!
2,Meh,I purchased this as a cake topper for a friends Oz themed party...and that's really all it's good for. It is very thin plastic and has a hollow backing. Doesn't look as nice as the picture.
1,Tinman Mom,"This was purchased for my three year-old's Halloween costume. I had read that it was made of cheap plastic, but that doesn't do it's crappiness justice. It is extremely thin, rigid plastic that tears and marks if slightly bent. It is only the front of the clock, there is absolutely no backing at all, just an open crevice. I didn't expect working hands, but I did expect a back. The whole product cost pennies to make and I paid [...] plus shipping. It just isn't worth that much."
1,Cheap heart,Very weak and flimsy product. Not even 3 dimensional -- barely half a heart. Can't believe I paid $9.99 for this accessory. Strongly suggest anyone seeking a Tin Man costume find an alternative accessory for the heart.
4,Buddha Da,This is an engaging book about one man's interest in Buddhism and how it effects his family. Once you get used to the unique writing style (which takes about a chapter) you will fly through this book in no time. It is a poignant read and expertly crafted.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
2,Too Clear,"When I tried this color in the salon I loved it, but for some reason this was way thinner and i needed three coats until you couldn't see my nail underneath. Not really a fan"
4,Different than previous Samsonite Focus Attache,"I have enjoyed owning and using three Samsonite Focus 4"" attache cases over the past 25 years. They are have been very durable, well-designed, and attractive looking; that is why I keep buying them. I was surprised, however, that this current model is substantially different than the previous model in several ways: -1- It is larger in height, width, and depth. -2- It has two separate hinges rather than the previous models' ""piano"" type hinge all the way across the back. -3- The finish is very shiny black. -4- There are hard plastic containers for pens/pencils, etc. which take up room inside. -5- The pen/pencil container has a flimsy plastic insert which is poorly designed and will not hold different thickness pens/pencils (I removed the insert completely). -6- There are no dividers inside the lid for organizing papers. It is a good attache case, just not an exact replacement of previous model. I hope this information is helpful to others."
4,Construction site strong,Sturdy and dependable. Bought as a gift for my husband who works in the construction industry so it puts up with a lot of abuse. He likes all the pockets to keep everything he needs handy. This is the second Samsonite attache I have bought him. The first one lasted 15 years!
5,Absolutely Amazing And Elegant!!!!,This is a very unique and amazing design case I'm absolutely satisfied and very impressed. I love how it wont open when the case is upside down. Worth every penny! A must get if you are on the fence.
3,Good Book,"Both of the other reviews are right...1 star because it is very light in most areas...However 5 stars for the things that I learned in an hour after picking up the book.So make it an average of 3 stars...It showed me a few things that I didn't learn in reading a ton of other Linux books... I've run Linux-Mandrake for almost 4 months now. But now I can do more, and it makes Linux very exciting!"
5,A terrific Summer activity for your aspiring cartoonist!,"We received Duane Barnhart's book ""Cartooning Basics"" on Saturday, and my son hasn't been able to put his pencil down! The book is filled with easy step-by-step illustrations for drawing a variety of expressions and poses for your characters. I bought my son a sketch pad to go along with the book. He was drawing again this morning before school! This book will provide many hours of entertainment for my son this summer. Thank-you Duane!"
2,Cartooning Basics,I purchased this book thinking that it was for aspiring cartoonist and animators but it was not. I suggest that you purchase a scientific book on human anatomy that has many illustrations of the skeletal and muscular systems if you are interested in becoming an animator or a cartoonist.
5,Excellent Book-Excellent Service,"The books were received as advertised, in a very timely manner. Excellent service."
4,Don't Know Why Others Don't get a Kick Out of This!,"I watched the entire season over a weekend with my boyfriend who got it on Amazon's Instant Video and I thought this was a much better show than the critics (and other reviewers) are saying... and I'm a woman! I think it's great that guys learn how to equalize their situation. Nice guys do NOT get on our radar even though we keep SAYING that is who we want. And we DO want a nice guy but you've got to be REAL and actuallty kind of a jerk befroe you get our attention. Once you have that, you can and should begin to show us kindness. I don't think meeting women comes naturally for MOST men and if this show helps them, I'm all for it."
4,great entertainment,while men struggle to do good in life i recomend to take trip to another world of reality and change to oneself
4,SUPER,This was one of the best episodes of this series. The nerds are worse than ever but you start to see some things move forward at a quicker pace with the 3 obvious ones who will be finalists improving their skills every show.
3,Entertaining,"Watched a couple episodes so far. I have to say I don't think the ""professionals"" are all that smooth. Not too impressed with their skills, but we'll see how it goes. Regardless, it's slightly entertaining to watch nerds learn some skills about talking to women."
5,I learned alot and you can too,"Even though the show is geared towards men, I learned alot. I had to tweak a few things being female but this program was still extremely useful. I have dated a ton since I bought these. I know feel I am definitely meeting and dating people more my equal. This was more than worth it. I feel I can chose who I am interested in now."
3,Kinda funny and interesting,"Not my favorite new show this year, it's kinda interesting, but didn't hold my attention for very long."
4,Great Stuff,"I have not yet heard the entire CD but do like what i've heard so far. It's a bit more modern sounding than their ""Rhode Trip"" (may he rest in peace) CD, but yet, at the same time seems to be heavily influenced by ""SpaceJazz"" or ""AcidJazz"" (don't really care for labels but it might be helpful to some) pioneer Lonnie Liston Smith and the Cosmic Echoes. This area is somewhat new to me since i have been more traditionally ""Fusion"" oriented and hadn't cared too much for the little Acid Jazz that i had heard. But if this is where Acid Jazz is at or is going, i am definitely going to be paying attention! Another contemporary group you might want to check out (although they are not really Acid but just a very soulful and R&B influenced Jazz band) is The Brad Upton Quintet. Especially their Black Orchid CD."
4,"Smooth grooves, trip-hop tones","It took me a few listenings before I began to appreciate this disc. At first it seemed a little on the repetitious side and sounded a bit like space/groove elevator music. But after three or four times the laid-back grooves started to feel right to me.This is one of those discs you put on when you're in the mood to chill-out but not drift-off. I was most impressed with the bass and percussion production, although don't expect a bunch of boring drum/bass dub tracks. These pieces are thoughtfully arranged, and not just thrown together.The only ""down side"" to me was that it seemed a little over-produced. I've never seen this group live so it's a little hard to tell how much of the finished product was due to creative engineering or digitized performances and how much is raw musicianship.Either way, the subtle jazziness of the disc and the overall laid-back feel makes it an easy disc to play day or night."
5,A must-have guide for hiking trips in the Grand Tetons,"Small and light (great for backpackers) cheap (great for everyone) and best of all, it gives what the title says. A great day-hiking guide for the park, offering some of the lore and background history of the Tetons, information concerning the park's geology, biotic communities, native wildlife and weather conditions. You'll never find a book on the subject that gives you more (or even close to as much) for such a low price. Can't be beat--a must for anyone planning a trip to the Grand Tetons."
2,GOOD ACTING BUT IT'S NOT THE ORIGINAL......,"Although I am a fan of Melanie Griffith, Don Johnson and John Goodman, I am not a fan of this version of Born Yesterday. If I had never seen the original or if the original was not one of my favorite movies, I may have rated it higher, because the story and the acting are good. But the original is a classic and, in my opinion, a movie should only be remade if the original can be improved on, and this one doesn't meet that standard. The best part of this movie is the ingenious song about some of the Amendments to the Constitution sung to the tune of ""The Twelve Days of Christmas."" If you really want to see this movie in its classic form, buy the original Judy Holliday, William Holden, Broderick Crawford version. Note to Hollywood: Classics don't need to be remade!"
4,a very good remake.,"this is a remake of the 50's movie by the same name,and i like it better,don't get me wrong the origional was a great movie,but i like john goodman in this role.premise have someone tutor your less than educated girlfriend.not an easy task when your falling in love with her.also don't be put off by some of the less than stellar reviews."
4,Tiny ruby slippers for tiny feet!,"My daughter lives in these shoes. She loves them! I bought the XS and they're a little big on her feet (she's 2 and wears a toddler size 6). The shoes do shed a lot of glitter so make sure to watch your little ones closely! The soles of the shoes are pretty slick, as well. The only traction is on the heel. Overall, I'm very happy with the quality of these shoes. :)"
5,Comfortable and true to size,My daughter loved these for Halloween with her Dorothy costume! They were comfortable and very cute! I would highly recommend!
2,NOT AS PICTURED,"Beware. The item that I received does NOT look like this photo with a neat bow. Instead, it has a cheapy-looking bow with zig-zag edges that resemble bow-tie pasta. Just not nice. When I tried to return it, I had to wait two days before Toynk customer service would respond; then they wanted a description of the item received before they would even give me authorization to return the item. Huge hassle!"
1,Big disappointment,"As a regular Amazon customer for years I feel disappointed for the first time.So here's my warning re. 2 overpriced products that look promising.Beware Stan Kenton CD collectors. Unless you want any disc in your collection (like me)it's NOT a good idea to purchase these 2 phony CD's.Both discs have the same 20 Capitol tracks and in an inferior sound as well.Shame on you Amazon not only for offering these CD's but also for having manufacturedthe unnumbered ""Acewonder ltd."" discs of Werner Last's Favourites Swing. Jan K."
3,FOR THE NOVICE ONLY!!!,"THIS IS CUTE AND GOOD FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER BELLY DANCED. FORGET THE ""VEIL"" - IT IS JUST A NARROW & LONG PIECE OF CHIFFON - THE MUSIC IS GOOD FOR THE BEGINNER & THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE ENOUGH FOR SOMEONE WHO JUST WANTS THE VERY BASICS. WORTH THE PRICE JUST FOR THE ZILLS..."
1,The only reason this item received one star from me is because I had to,"The irony in this is because I love Armani Emporio. I thought I had gotten lucky when I seen the price on this item, but obviously had nothing but bad luck. I never received this item after paying over $60 for it. I will NOT be buying from this seller again."
4,Fun tub squirters,My two-yr.-old loves these squirters. He giggles every time I got them out at bath time. He had even figured out how to squirt them at himself.
5,My boys love these in the bath,"The only negative is that the cars fill with water and squirt (creating their own little knowledge of cause and effect, plus FUN) but the rest of the vehicles don't fill up. The kids love them anyway. I highly recommend this."
3,Not good for baby to bite,My baby is just 8 months old. He likes this toys very much. But the material is not good for baby to bite.
3,"Fun, durable, BUT mold grew inside","I put these on my son's baby registry and received them. He loved playing with them at bathtime, however one day I was looking at the bottom of them and saw that there were black marks on the inside. I was hoping it wasn't mold because I never saw black stuff coming out of the toys when I would sqirt water out. However, as I continued to look, I was convinced mold had grew inside and I had to throw them out. Other than that, they were great. Although I am not sure there is a way to prevent the mold from growing and even though they are durable and he loved them, mold is just too much of a health hazard to mess around with."
2,Too small,"THe four toys are cute but very small, pait comes off, and water gets inside, so it's hard to keep clean."
3,my baby likes it!,He loves it and I brought it with him to the pool. But i am not sure whether it is safe to chew because my 8 month boy can't stop chewing it...
2,description is wrong,"The description for this item says there are 5 squirters, when in fact there are only 4 (there isn't a car). Item is as pictured, rather than as described. They aren't as big or as nice as I had imagined for the price. Not bad, but just a little disappointing all the way around. I'll probably return them."
1,Great software - TERRIBLE REGISTER PROCESS!,"I downloaded the software and was very excited to set up my own business cards. The first time in it asked if I want to register and I said ""later"" and it said you get 5 tries. So, the next time I tried to register and it calls their 800 number. However, it was busy, BUT THATS ONE STRIKE AGAINST ME! So, for the next 4 times I got into the software I tried to register every time, and every time it was busy. Now I cant use the software. So, no matter how nice it is, and it was easy to use, its now useless."
1,Be careful with this program,"I built a nice biz card. Then I tried to print, and the print options were not available. They were ""greyed out."" I tried everything possible to make them available, but to no avail. That, however, was not the problem. I tried contacting MySoftware to get some simple guidance and got absolutely NO response. I got telephone voice messages constantly, telling me to leave a message and they'd get back to me. Right! I went to their Web site and discovered that they were not intersted in having me contact them. In fact, they set up barriers to every possible contact method.Their software went back to where I bought it. Stear clear of MySoftware...any of their products. They clearly don't care about their customers."
5,Every little bit helps...,No one book can change a persons life but some like this provides more tools for the project that may lie ahead.
3,"Major refining, minor declining","This sound dissector and refractor may have been overpraised upon arrival simply due to the new laptop-samurai nature of it all, but by his fourth outing Fennesz had all but silenced skeptics, myself included, with continual sonic refinement and tonal placement breathing unforeseen life into previously sterile alien-aesthetics, even striving for structure in a few songer-sounding songs. It still is far from the second coming though, as an apathetic unevenness, accented by ineffective formula-meddling, eventually squanders noticeable momentum built from better production within the approach this man takes best."
4,Perfect for the C programmer moving to C++,"As a C (and other languages) programmer, I have spent hours in the bookstore reading 20 or more books on C++ trying to find one that would give me the C++ concepts quickly and simply - and this book does. I am quite certain that it will not be my last book on C++, it is NOY a complete referece by any means. I would also add that it is definitely NOT for someone with no programming experience (even though the copy says it is). While this book is not really what it purports to be, it is perfect for the C programmer moving to C++."
1,No way to finish.,"Cannot recommend this book. 1. So many errors in sample codes and explanation, which takes a lot of time to figure out for a biginner like me. 2. From around the array/pointer, samples get suddenly difficult, and they are provided as a function. Since these functions are linked to teh main program in various ways using pointers, the absent of main program really hurts. 3. The structure gets more and more disorganized as topics get more complicated.In short, it is almost impossible for a biginner to learn C++ from this book. I readup to a half, after spending much more than weekend, but had to give up eventually. I got another non-crash book and now finally in a right track. I have never seen a book that contains so many mistakes in important parts such as early samples, which I found fairly irresponsible."
2,Book needs improvement,"This book needs improvement in several areas: 1 - clear explanation in key points, like pointers and constructors. 2 - better revision (too many errors that make the reader lose a lot of time) 3 - review the code (almost nothing works with the software that is shipped with the book). I gave up reading the book and went to another one that didn't promise to teach me in a weekend and has a lot more explanations and examples."
2,Dissapointing...,"This book was my first book on learning C++. After reading several other books on C++, I can honestly say that this book was dissapointing at best. In a beginner's eyes, it is easy to imagine how this book might seem handy. It is informative and helpful on elementary topics, and also was helpful in the respect that I had no idea where to get a compiler or how to use it. However, once the book delves into more advanced topics, it becomes apparent that1.) the author never bothered to debug and test his programs and2.) that the author is inadequate at explanations.If you have plenty of money to burn, buy this book. Otherwise, try to get a book that doesn't have some sort of false ""in a weekend!"" or ""in 21 days"" or ""for idiots!"" promise. Learning to program takes hard work and perseverance, and those kind of books simply aren't cut out for teaching programming (not in the timeframe they promise, at least.)."
2,Relatively useless...,"This book is relatively useless unless you intend to write the programs he has made into examples in the book. Nothing is explained or defined, many explanations are missing as far as terms, ideas, or even how or what something does. I would not recommend this book."
5,perfect and comfortable,this bra is one of the most comfortable bras I have ever own. Light weight on and looks great under chlothes.
2,decent umbrella,[...] I too gave it two stars because it is a decent umbrella that dries amazingly fast.
3,Needs to be better organized,"There is some very good information in this film but it lacks chapters or scenes making it very difficult to locate that information on replay. It is also not really a documentary in the ordinary sense, falling somewhere between an Art Film and a compilation of shorts about various aspects of Brazilian religious beliefs. The visuals and music are interesting but often, as is the case with the first song, they run longer than your interest in the subject given the limited explanation provided. Chapter headings would also have given the viewer a better idea of how the parts relate to each other. I don't doubt that David Byrne was very well versed on this subject. Unfortunately, having that knowledge can make it harder to see the gaps in understanding experienced by a less well educated audience."
3,I'm not sure what exactly to write?,"Maybe ""Ile Aiye"" is some kind of code for David Byrne took his camcorder to some of the most remote parts of South America and filmed lots of dancing, drum playing and trance like singing.No Talking Heads, no David Byrne, no subtitles, no translation, no music you would even understand... You're on you own on this one and you'll find yourselves looking numerous times at your airline tickets saying ""when does this jet depart so I can get the hell out of here?""Unless the theme of this video is something you are ABSOLUTELY familiar with, don't waste your time or money.You can save your money and watch programs like this on the ""foreign culture channel""."
2,I love David Byrne but this was a bit tedious.,I watched this once and yawned. I love David Byrne but this didn't do much for me.
5,Excellent Suede Winter Flap Cap,"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my husband. We feel that it is dressy enough looking to be woren with his black leather coat. It is very nice and warm. It is similar to the items that he is comfortable wearing. We were surprised that it has vent holes, but it is warm enough for them to be practical. The price on the item was definitely fair. It arrived here in time for Christmas. It was appropriately packaged. I love seeing him wear it and he must like it because he never fails to wear it when he goes into town on business. I believe other men admire it because I have seen other men looking at it. Perhaps that was because we live in the extremely cold area of South Dakota and they were not wearing anything on their head?"
1,NOT winter hat,"This hat is a light weight UNLINED cotton baseball cap with faux shearling ear flaps - up here in Canada this is definitely NOT a ""winter"" hat. Very misleading advertising."
4,Old School,"This has them all, from Arodite to Zeus. Hades ruled over the land of the dead, or hell. Charon isn't mentioned here. Pan is mentioned. In 400 AD the Christian God became official in Rome."
3,"Ginger is fine, container is not","I have been enjoying ginger for years, but do not consider myself a gourmand. That said, I enjoy the flavor of this ginger.My issue is the packaging.The material the tubs are made with is bad. Brittle, thin, weak. When I got the box with these in it, half needed new containers immediately (one of these was thrown away upon further inspection as being too compromised). And the rest, I didn't trust to just leave on a shelf and stay together.I got this in Feb. 2011, hopefully this has improved since. Oh yes, I am still eating the ginger I put into better containers. So no complaints with it lasting if it's in better storage conditions."
3,Poor packaging,"Good taste to the ginger, albeit a bit on the sweet side. The problem, similar to another reviewer, is with the packaging. Each and every thin plastic container was cracked and open with much of the ginger on the bottom of the cardboard holder. We had planned to give these as Xmas gifts, but now have to go to Plan B. Shame on Klein's and/or Amazon for their shoddy packaging."
5,Really nice,I bought these for my brother. Very good quality. Each shoe has its own black flannel bag. Rugged and classy. Size 14- true to size.
5,Another quality Product,This is another Quality product from Sherline.Now I can finally put knurls on the items I make.Nice solid construction.
3,Thrashing uncompromising stuff within!,"Be forewarned. This music is like a visit to the dentist. It is abrasive in moments, calm in others. It would be sacrilegious of me to edit out the bombastic angular parts and join together the calmer sections. But I guess this music is like a long coast to coast voyage across the Atlantic: there will be moments of calm and moments of absolutely horrendous thrashing waves. If this kind of voyage is your cup of tea you'll enjoy Carlos Chavez. If it isn't stay on shore."
4,Good book,"I bought this book for my son who isn't a big reader. But he liked this book. Actually, he like almost all Bill Wallace books, so apparently the author knows how to grab the attention of middle school boys."
5,The wonderful adventerous: Upchuck and the Rotten Willy,"If you like animal books this is the book for you. It is adventerous, funny, sad, and loveable! It is the most wonderful book I have ever read. You have to read it; it is so exciting you'll not want to put this book down! You'll also want to read it over and over again."
5,It's a Must-Read-Gotta-Get-Book,"I love this book. I got it at a school book fair in 4th grade. I think all pet lovers, or any one that would like to read a good book, should read this one. Upchucks (Chuck) best friend moves away. One day his is stuck between to fences. The Rotten Willy (a kind dog), and the one that would like to bite Chucks head off. To find out what happens, You've Got To Read It Frist!"
4,Cats and Dogs can Still be Friends,It is a funny book and a good book. I think it is funny bcause first the dog hates the cat and the cat hates the dog. And my 2nd reason is because the dogs name is chuck and he throws up in someones car and so they change his name to Up Chuck instead of Chuck. #1 book
2,"Generally good, but few details or tips","I have previously read several of the ""Your X Year Old"" books by Ames and Ilg and loved them. For some reason, I couldn't find one on 9 year olds by that series, so I thought I'd try this 9 year old book in this series (I'd never read anything by the Tavistock Clinic). I was really disappointed! The book gave few actual characteristics of 9 year olds, but said a lot of ""9-year olds vary greatly in this area"" kinds of things. I found it to be very unhelpful in dealing with my 9 year old. (For example, it didn't tell me if temper tantrums or mood swings were normal, etc.) It was easy to read, however, and gave lots of anecdotes (though these were only mildly helpful). It was also a very short book. Disappointing..."
3,awkward but interesting,"A pretty good movie, sort of a Swedish St. Elmo's Fire - Luke Perry sort of stuck out like a sore thumb, but I guess any American would in an all Swedish cast. I liked seeing the characters come to a realization of their relationships and who they are to be with. All in all I enjoyed it because I have a hard time finding current day movies in Swedish language, so I appreciated seeing it."
2,Rxaggerated =portrayal of Sweden,"It has its fun moments but is largely an exaggerated portrayal of a Swedish holiday gathering.. Yes, there is lots of drinking and sex in Swedish summer holidays, but this is over the top."
5,Round and robust,"Does whatever a cooler is supposed to do only with more style. Well built, robust, pretty - the orange color is a plus."
4,La revolution Los hermanos,"Le magazine Trax l'annoncé comme une revolution ,le premier titre que j'ai écouté m'a fait revé l'album est par contre un peu plus plat, mais il s'écoute parfaitement chez soi!!!"
5,What might have been,"I discovered 1994 in Boston in 1978 when WBCN showcased then at a $1.04 per ticket concert. I was utterly blown away. Karen Lawrence was incandescent. I immediately bought this album and practically wore it out. The followup, Please Stand By is equally good. Interestingly, Please Stand By is one of the first albums to have been at least partially recorded digitally. I kept waiting for radio to pick up on 1994, but it never happened. That's a crying shame."
5,Finally on CD!,"I'm bit tardy in discovering this little gem, but nonetheless glad to see this is finally available on cd (and in an expanded format). In 1978 Karen Lawrence very quickly became one of my favorite female singers, and has remained so throughout the years, including the other Jack Douglas-helmed ""Girls' Night Out"" by Karen Lawrence & the Pinz in 1982. (I have yet to catch up on her Blue By Nature period.)"
2,"Buy this for the repertoire, not the performances.","Fascinating exploration of now forgotten American composers. The program notes are well written and informative. Unfortunately the performances rarely rise above an undergraduate, state-school level, and often sink below. The recorded sound one dimensional and the quartet sounds as if they play on plywood instruments. However, if you're researching repertoire, this is an important recording, and hopefully these beautiful pieces will be visited by greater artists in the near future!"
2,Fun to see a VERY young Daniel Craig...,"...In a role he'd probably like to pretend never happened! (But he looks darn cute, though!)For the kids, this is not one of Disney's better flicks. Plot is silly & predictable. Special effects are surprisingly cheap looking (especially for a Disney film). But there is nothing offensive to worry about as a parent, and it's a decent film to run on the DVD player on a raining Saturday when the kids are chanting ""I'm bored. I'm bored.""For Daniel Craig fans, it's good for a chuckle to see him in one of his very earliest roles (nothing like his usual edgy work - he must have had the rent due when this role was offered to him!) His shaggy, slightly surfer-style haircut reminds you of Duran Duran. Very cute in silly medieval costume. He was funny at times, with a bit of silliness in the role that makes me wish he'd let down his ""artistic standards"" and do a romantic comedy (*SIGH*).Family-friendly entertainment."
2,I like this movie because kate winslet was on it.,"It was pretty chessy to me but what the heck do I know, the only reason I like it because my kate winslet was in it and did a pretty good job of acting."
2,Two Stars,"I rated this 2 stars because there are TWO STARS in the film. Kate Winslet from Titanic , Etc. and the new James Bond 007 (Casino Royale) Daniel Craig. My Daughter is a huge Daniel Craig fan and she got the film just to see what he looked like before she was one year old. (she's now 12) This is run of the mill, every line is predictable stuff but, I must say after having taken my daughter to see Casino Royale 9 times, this was a real hoot!!! It is fun seeing actors early in their career paying their dues. i have seen an episode of the old 1950's TV series Highway Patrol and it had Clint Eastwood as a Biker. It was one of the first things he ever did. Anyway, I would reccommend this movie if you need a good laugh, unintentional as it may be."
1,Very disappointed!!,"This was bought for my husband so he and our son could have boat races. Little did I know when I purchased this item, but the 9.6v 700mAh NiCd battery pack was NOT included even though the ad says all that is needed is the 9v battery. Needless to say we have a very interesting piece of plastic sitting around with NO ability to use it. Amazon does not even carry the 9.6v 700mAh NiCd battery pack needed so we are stuck trying to locate one somewhere before we can even attempt to charge it and use. Do not buy this unless you want to cause great disappointment."
1,Unsatisfied,"To whom it may concern,This product was a gift for my son, when we recieved the FIRST one the box was all ripped and broken. Needless to say the toy did not work. A second toy was shipped and the box was also in bad shape and the toy again did not work. You very quikly picked up the second toy and refused to send another.I have yet recieved my refund and am very dissatisfied with the service. I would appreciate an e-mail in regards to my refund.Thank You Frank Labombarda"
5,The Shadow Shifter Saves The Sea Arrow,My zig zag racer2 fliped the sea arrow over.Thanks to my birthday money I bought the shadow shifter.(stealth).It brought the sea arrow back.
1,"""History"" without reference to sources","While the narrative is somewhat entertaining, the author provides no sources for the situations he claims represent the life of Patino. There is no indication of how long the author lived in Bolivia (if he did) and no way to check many of his statements against either Spanish or English-language sources. What expertise the author brings to his findings is not indicated. Lack of verifiable information makes the book little more than a string of anecdotes that may or may not be true."
1,WILL NEVER USE AMAZON AGAIN SELLER LIED ABOUT ITEM THEY WERE SELLING SO I BOUGHT IT AND FOUND OUT IT DID NOTHING THEY SAID,I BOUGHT IT AN FOUND OUT THAT THEY LIED ABOUT THE COMPUTER PROGRAM AND THEN THEY WOULD NOT REFUND MY MONEY THEY ARE SCAMMERS AND IT HAS MADE ME NOT WANT TO USE AMAZON EVER AGAINHOPE PEOPLE READ THIS AND DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLERTHEY DONT EVEN HAVE THE BALLS TO CALL ME BACK
1,Item NOT as stated!,"It said the program was for the following: Proventure Greeting Cards by AvanquestPlatform: Windows NT / 98 / 2000 / Me / 95, Mac, Linux, UnixI bought it specifically for mac and it is NOT compatible!! I can't even use it!!"
1,Not for MAC,Bought this for my MAC but it does not work as advertised with MAC application.Out $10.48 costs too much money to return for a $5.50 refund.False advertising.
3,Battery for Dell Inspiron 3800,"The battery arrived on time or quicker than the vendor said it would arrive. It charged up and everything worked as expected. The battery did not fit in the battery bay as neatly as the production version from Dell. It sticks out just enough to make a rough edge. It was not enough of a problem to contact the vendor. Overall, I think it is still better than paying the cost of a perfect fit battery."
4,Cute and well made...,"We bought this for my son's state in a box project (North Dakota). It was a little larger than I thought, but worked great. Easy to press for sound. Held up to being handled by hundred of kids testing it out and still plays. Bird sounds are not too loud or too quiet--just right :) We gave him a shot of spray adhesive to his bottom and sat him on the box and there he sits to this day..."
2,OK if youre not too concerned with looking cheesy,"Looking back at the pics for the item, I should have known better. They could work if you're just doing a lighthearted take on a Cowboys cheerleader. If you want a serious look for your costume, these boot tops are not the accessory for you. They were very loose and floppy looking. Just going with white boots is a better looking choice."
2,BootTops,Not what I expected. Too floppy and has space on the shoes. We cannot use them for our purposes. I never took them out of the package other than to try one of them on for looks.
3,"Excellent collection of important works, execution uneven.","This is an excellent compilation of important American symphonic works at a nice price (it is a double CD from VOX recorded [analog] in 1971 and 1973). The program content far outweighs the intonation problems (mostly in the winds and brass), and usually from the Westphalian Symphony Orchestra. The standard of the Utah Symphony is quite high, making the Rorem and Schuman Symphonies very worthwhile! Bravo to VOX for this series-- if you enjoy Copland, Barber, and other perhaps more well-known American composers, you will get your money's worth here!!"
5,"Good for Girls, too!","We have an advanced 6 year old who LOVES this game. She is no tomboy, but rather a ""Barbie"" girl. I was reluctant about getting this for her, but it turns out that she adores playing it. We got this game for her L-Max."
3,batman,i bought a Batman leapster game. I thought it was brand new. It was not. I had to give it as a christmas gift. But it worked find.
5,Sensory Reliving of a Lost Time,"I bought this originally because I play trumpet and saw Vizzutti's name on the list of artists. Of course, he's excellent, but what's really special here is that you can close your eyes and be back in the town park in small town America of the 2nd half of the 19th century when every town had a band while they waited for TV to be invented. I have a photo of my ancestors posing with the Mount Pleasant Mills (PA) band in the early 20th century and feel I'm there when I hear this music."
5,Rock Is Dead... Long Live Rock,"Rigor Mortis Sets In has some totally funny and politically incorrect today songs.The songs were politically incorrect back then come to think of it, but Who Cares!1. Gimme That Rock `N' Roll - very average2. Mr. Bass Man - Appropriate but I find it slightly annoying to listen to.3. Do The Dangle - A song about suicide by hanging done as a dance song. Really good.4. Hound Dog - The Elvis song. No improvement over the King's version.5. Made In Japan - Another great song about infidelity.6. My Wife - This song was on Who's Next. This is a different version. Who's Next version was slightly better.7. Roller Skate Kate - A tragedy song done in the fifties style, funny.8. Peg Leg Peggy - Another fifties style song totally over the top. Hilarious.9. Lucille - Another fifties type song.10. Big Black Cadillac - Pretty cool song of a guy stuck between the cops and the mob."
2,Highly Dissapointed,"Although it was somewhat interesting seeing actual footage of an infantry platoon, I was very dissapointed with this film. It was far to short, however it seemed to drag on endlessly. There is only one action scene in the documentary at the very end, which is it's highpoint...as low as it was. I found it quite pointless to film a platoon in vietnam and then say, this person died two weeks from now...this person died four days from now..."" I know that people died in vietnam, unfortunately, I still don't know how they fought."
5,The Vietnam Documentary you didn't see on CBS,"I was wondering [while viewing this remarkable film] why I never saw it as a kid during Vietnam on the U.S. media. I realized why it was buried in the American press soon enough. It showed Americans helping sick women, children and wounded enemy personnel --- while being shot to pieces."
1,Disappointing,"I ordered this video based on the overwhelmingly high marks other viewers gave, but I cannot concur. Although some of the action scenes were enough to evoke strong emotion, overall the video is replete with irrelevant scenes like the ankle-level footage of the soldier's footsteps; bad music and nearly indecipherable narration. English subtitles would be a plus. I can't decide whether the high point was the soldier buying his ""girlfriend"" a guitar while on R&R, or the urination scene."
5,GREAT PLUGS!,"JUST GOT THESE PLUGS TODAY AFTER RESEARCHING THE NET ON THE BEST PLUGS FOR FUEL ENCONOMY I CAME ACROSS THE IR'S . I PREVIOUS PURCHASE THE E3 SPARK PLUGS BECAUSE THE INFO. ON THERE SITE BUT I WAS'NT SATISFIED WITH THEM AND WONDERED IF THEY REALLY WORK , THEY ALSO HAVE A GAP MUCH LARGER ON THEM THEN THE RECOMMENDED FACTORY GAP FOR MY TRUCK. ANYWAY I WENT FOR IT AND BOUGHT THE BOSCH IR AND INSTALLED THEM , I TEST DROVE MY TRUCK AROUND TOWN FREEWAYS AND HWYS AND NOTICED THE FUEL NEEDLE DID'NT MOVE DOWN AS MUCH NOT LIKE THE E3'S AND NOTICED MORE LOW END TORQUE. SO I WOULD SAY THESE PLUGS WORKS WELL AND BETTER THAN THE E3'S BUT I ALSO INSTALLED A THROTTLE BODY SPACER FOR THE TRUCK SO IM WONDERING IF THE COMBINATION OF BOTH HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE AND FUEL ENCONOMY."
1,Do NOT USE IN A HEMI ENGINE,"Time to change my plugs in my DODGERAM 1500 5.7 Hemi.I searched Amazon for some good plugs.I found some reviews on these with the site telling me they will work in my 2004 Dodgeram 1500.I paid AMMCO Transmission 250.00 to put them in.The cost is high because its real pain in labor time for these.Mind you 16 plugs go in this engine.OK so the first 2000k miles everything was fine......then the problem....went to the Dodge dealer the service dept says do not put platinum plugs in this engine...he gave me some tech talk about heat and all that...and the misfire codes were all over the place...3 misfires.I said to the service rep""'but Amazon says they fit"" Yea they fit just not compatible with this engine,,,he says 5000k more mile and could blow a piston.Another $337.00 to replace plugs again.DO NOT PUT THESE IN A DODGE HEMI ENGINE!!!!!!!!"
5,Less expensive but yet powerful!!!,"Installed it in my 02 dodge GC, it works great, took it for almost 1000 mi in one day up and down terrain with no hesitation, new plugs and wires, hopefully will stay like that forever.. not bad for the price plus rebate.."
1,Go with OEM...,"Bought these for a 2005 Trailblazer (90,000 mile) which resulted in constant random misfiring (p0300), hesitation, and poor mpg. Decided to go back to the OEM ACDelco plugs and everything runs great now."
2,Antiquated software,"We used this software for our wedding invitations a while back. To be kind, it's antiquated. Note in the description that it is designed to run on Windows 3.x (which predates Win95, Win98, and Win2K) ... there is a reason why it says that. Although MyMailList can manage a mail list and print out a variety of label and evelope formats (including custom ones), the user interface is pretty clunky compared with current software. We're about to send out another mailing and we're not going to use this any more; we're looking for new software."
2,"too fast, too slow","This book is pretty bad, I must say. It goes much to slowly over some things (they could've spent 2 or 3 lessons on the alphabet instead of 5, for example) and then super fast over important stuff. They will mention an important point of grammar once within a dense paragraph of information, and you have to go searching for it or you'll miss it completely. They don't provide enough practice examples, either.The tapes also move too fast, without enough pause time for you to repeat; you will have to pause the tape after each phrase if you want time to finish it before the next phrase starts.Overall, get a different book if you can. If I didn't have Korean co-workers and friends to help me with this, I would be completely confused by this book."
5,Friendly for Beginners,"This is the first volume for beginners out of 3 volumes. I found it the most user-friendly Korean textbook I ever used to teach Korean to English speaking students. It starts with the very basic Korean alphabet. Then each unit has vocabulary, pronounciation, grammar and practice using new teaching methods. It is availabe with or without cassette tapes. I would recommend to get with cassettes which are excellent for students. This text was developed by Seou National University. I understand many American universities and colleges use this."
3,Only for rank beginners...,"The introduction into Hangul(the alphabet of Korean)is good. Really. The tapes provide good examples to follow. The drawbacks to this series are the extremely limited vocabulary. The vocabulary that the first book offers is not very useful, ie, a chapter on dry cleaners and one on buying gas. If you are a rank beginner and have no one to teach you the sounds of Hangul, go for it. But, I agree with the other reviewer, switch series after the first book."
5,A Childhood Favorite,"Took me a long time to find this -- couldn't remember the author's name or title. I read this when I was about 10 years old, back in the 70s, and I always remembered it. It was my first introduction to some of the real concepts of Irish Fairies -- particularly the Sidhe.I don't know whether it will stand the test of time for me now, but I'm looking forward to re-reading it some 30 years later...(I also read and loved her book The Walking Stones.)"
5,Lamps,"Thanks for the shipment of my items, they are really nice!! And they arrived in one piece. Very great item!!"
5,Very Nice Machine,"This Viking processor is quality built. It has a heavy base with rollers on the rear to move it easily across the counter but will stay put during operation. The motor is very quiet with a single control to either run or pulse. The unit comes with a blade storage case, also large and small blades and bowls. That's all you need. The price is a bit more than the higher store-brand models but I'm glad I decided to go with the Viking. The quality and style is supurb.TF"
1,terrible customer service,I ordered the movie one good cop and never got my order and I even emailed and called Amazon and the seller. What stinks is i just wanted the movie and got nothing. i hope to still get the movie as a frustration for my dispair.Phil G
2,A sentimental action drama... go figure,"Widowed cop Stevie Diroma (Anthony LaPaglia) dies on the job. His partner Artie Lewis (Michael Keaton) decides to take care of his three daughters for a while. Artie's infertile wife (Rene Russo) would like to adopt them, but given his salary they live in a small apartment, so the kids will end up in adopting agency. Therefore Artie decides to stick up the drug dealer responsible for Diroma's death and use the money to buy a big house where he can live with the children.Is he supposed to be a 'good' cop? A bad cop isn't necessarily Harvey Keitel in Ferrara's 'Bad Lieutenant'. Innocent people get killed due to his smart idea but he gets away with it because his colleagues cover some things up. In a world where the Internal Affairs DO exist this movie makes no sense.An overlong and unfocused sentimental cop drama that ends with an ordinary shoot-out. Won't go down well with neither action nor drama fans."
1,Shame on AHC,"I have long been a serious fan of African Head Charge, Dub Syndicate, Bim Sherman and all the other On-U Sound bands, but even Adrian Sherwood's legendary recording studio couldn't pull this one out of the crapper. I was so disappointed in this endeavor.I would highly recommend ""Songs of Praise"" if you really want to hear what this amazing band is all about.Don't waste your money on Akwaaba."
5,A must see comedy!,"This movie is so funny! I was pleasantly surprised at the writing and comedy as well as the production quality! As an avid Independent film watcher, I was thoroughly impressed with the whole movie. It looks and feels like a Hollywood high budget movie. I particularly loved the ""Kooter"" and ""Possum"" characters! They are a riot! There were lots of great racing and action scenes as well. Well worth seeing!"
2,Not to be mistaken...,"..for the Godspeed side project, which was my problem when receiving this completely lukewarm sampler reeking, though perhaps not stinking, of stale techno."
5,Gotta have it!!,"If you are a George Strait fan, or grew up watching rodeos in the Houston Astrodome as I did, this is a must have item. It's a classic."
1,It's a rip-off,"Very poor quality not worth the money. The video and sound are subpar, the only way they sell this is that it's George Strait."
5,Knockout Performance!,"I've been a big fan of George Strait since 1983 and this dvd doesn't disappoint. The tracks are terrific. And I think the 5.1 Dolby Digital mix is excellent. If there is too much crowd noise in the surround speakers, just lower the surround level on your receiver! The sound is dynamic and clean. The 2 channel mix is great too. This is a must buy for all Strait fans and for even the casual country music fan. After all, George is the King. After watching this dvd, it's clear that King George still rules the throne!"
5,Classic George Strait...,"This a very well made DVD. The video is crisp and clear especially with progressive scan and component video out and the audio is true Dolby 5.1, with an excellent soundfield. With the talented Ace in The Hole Band backing him up they go from one number one hit to another. Perfornmed on a circular stage at the Astrodome in Houston. A must have for any George Strait fan. The DVD credits don't give much info other than song selection but not to worry it's all there - buy it...."
5,She Loves Him As Much As She Can,"Kim Novak superbly portrays S. Maugham's Mildred Rogers in OF HUMAN BONDAGE. This is the absolute best screen adaption of the novel. Novak shines in this movie. See how the character of Mildred completely changes from beginning to end. Fans of Kim will delight in seeing this so very beautiful a talented actress in a story of how a cold social climbing waitress toys with the obsessive affections of a young medical student, played by Laurence Harvey."
4,Rommance set in 19th century England between a medical stude,"nt and a waitress on the make. Laurence Harvey and Kim Novak bring this novel to life. The film spans several years during which the waitress becomes a lady of the evening and the medical student graduates. While destined for greatness, Harvey must come to final terms with lost love and compassion."
5,Thank you!!!,"Got the product quickly and it was a gift for my best friend who was ecstatic to that I was able to find this version for her!Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!"
4,The Walton segment,"There is one moment in this interview which I found especially interesting and instructive. Walton in the interview explains that his shyness and stuttering shielded him from people for many years. Others would do the talking for him. This by the way explains the sense fans had of his being silent and surly and somehow mysteriously problematic. Walton tells how he met the sportscaster Marty Glickman who took him aside and told him that he had to overcome his lack of speech problem. Glickman told him how to create a working program to do this, the same way his basketball coach constructed a working program for how to win at basketball games. Walton did as Glickman asked, overcame his stuttering and became , what he is at the time of the interview, a professional sports broadcast.Much of the interview is devoted to talking basketball. Fans should enjoy it."
1,Junk. Don't do it,The title says it all. I just got it and it's now working less than a week later. Junk!
5,Jazzy? YES!!,"All That Jazz is certainly all that jazz. The movie vividly described what some actors, actresses, and directors go through behind the stage. The happy moments, the sad moments, the loving, the caring, and the joyous. I think it gives a marvelous review of real life jazz dancing. I have to say, that I, myself have learnt several dance routines from that movie. Oh, yeah, Roy Scheider was awesome! I think I fell in love with that man!"
4,a harrowing roman a clef from a top song & dance man,"while i dont usually enjoy self-indulgence in an artist, i cant deny that this works very well. bob fosse chronicles his own mental and physical collapse from a few years earlier while simultaneously directing ""lenny"" on film and ""chicago"" on stage. this is a nightmare movie, in no way pleasant to watch but fascinating nonetheless. strong performances from roy scheider (as fosse), leland palmer (as gwen verdon), and ann reinking (as ann reinking). and btw, take a look at what won the oscar as best movie that year when this (and ""apocalypse now"", ""breaking away"", ""being there"" and other worthies finished out of the money!)"
3,All That Jazz,Spell binding. The story and the music and the dancing and the acting. Bob Fosse was a master with no equal.Absolutely a great movie.
1,Waste of my money,I loved Chicago and thought from the other posted ratings that this would be just as great - or better. It was NOT. I haven't been able to watch the full movie YET!!!!
1,Don't waste your money!,"I loved Chicago and can see why it was the best film of the year. I thought I would like ""All That Jazz"" too but it really stunk. I hated the plot. The dance numbers were nice but it was a total waste of my ...for the DVD. Just my $.02."
4,Fosse and Scheider,"I saw this movie at least 7 times when it was in the theater, and finally bought it on dvd. It's a fairly sardonic look at theater, and the travails of the artist--a slight step down from 8 1/2--buta glitzy, overwrought step down. Looking back at it, there's a lot of cheese on this burger, but it's high cheese.I still love this movie. The heart sugery scene no longer makes me sqeamish. The dancing still makes me happy."
4,This movie is a trip!,"okay, I didn't think I'd like it judging from the title, but this movie is so odd! A trippy and sometimes terrifying look at showbiz and its indulgences, told through Gideon's dreams and hallucinations during a life-threatening operation. I haven't seen much of Bob Fosse's work (just this film on cable TV), but the success of this ""art imitating life"" musical only tempts me to delve deeper into his world. great, weird, wonderful film..."
5,GREAT MOVIE,"MY UNCLE FRED TOBIAS WROTE THE SONG IN ALL THAT JAZZ,TAKE OFF WITH US,AND ITS GREAT AS THE MOVIE.Jeffrey Tobias"
5,Lover of Musicals,"I absolutely love this video. It took me back to highschool days. The quality is better than on the movie screen and the sound quality was superb. If you are a fan of musical, this is a must to add to your collection. I found myself singing and dancing with the actors. My video arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition."
3,An interesting musical film with a bad dvd transfer,When I remembered having seen this movie I knew I wanted a copy for my collection. The film was enjoyable except during those moments when you notice that the voices seem to be out of sync with the actual mouth movements. This appears periodically during the film and was easily noticeable. Other than for this I would have been happy with the film to the fullest extent. This is what happens unfortunately for some vhs to dvd transfers.
4,A musical unlike any other,"The Bottom Line:Something of a musical reimagining of 81/2 (but actually interesting and engaging) that depicts a Fosse-like character (played by a fabulous Roy Scheider) as he moves closer to the grave, All That Jazz occasionally feels self-indulgent--how could it not?--but contains some standout musical sequences and a lot of compelling material; it's imperfect but very interesting even to people like myself who don't typically like musicals.3.5/4"
3,Great dance but lengthy show,"A pretty nice video except for the fact that I found parts of it a little bit lengthy and boring with Fosse going back and forth with his dillema. It was a little cliche at one point , however I do enjoy the fantastic ""dance"" involved here and there"
1,Disappointed ! Why would I be sent aboard movie copy knowing it is not compatible as I tried 3 different DVD players....,"So very disappointed! It did arrive before Christmas but was sent a copy that can not be used here in US as it is not compaitable with our DVD players which I tried Three different ones. The funny thing about that is it gives you message saying it is a aboard copy and is not compatible, your company aware of this, why would I be sent this?? I am very disappointed in Amazon as this was my first purchase and may be my last. Was not aware you were not dealing with in US as this would be another reason to not support your company....."
5,COMPELLING,"THIS FILM WAS BRILLIANT. I SAW THIS AS AN 13-YEAR OLD GIRL, AND EVEN AT THAT AGE, I GOT THIS FILM BECAUSE FOSSE IS SO EFFECTIVE IN HIS STORYTELLING IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY. JOE'S ADDICTION TO THE DANCE, TO WOMEN, TO EXCESS, TO PLEASURE, TO SELF-DESTRUCTION, TO CREATION IS SO STARKLY AND UNCOMPROMISINGLY PORTRAYED. I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND HOW A PREVIOUS REVIEW COULD SAY THE DANCE SEQUENCES WERE TOO LONG. BOB FOSSE REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL AND BREATH-TAKING CHOREAGRAPHERS OF THE LAST HALF CENTURY. HIS STYLE IS SOPHISTICATED, SMART AND WITTY. THE EDITING, THE HOSPITAL SEQUENCES, THE GLIMPSES INTO HIS CONTINUED DESTRUCTION AND FAILING HEALTH ARE NOTHING SHORT OF GRIPPING. AND THE MUSICAL AND SHOW-BIZ SEQUENCES SHOW BOTH THE SLEAZY AND THE JOYFUL FACETS OF THIS WORLD.I COULD GO ON ALL NIGHT....I JUST CAUGHT THIS ON BRAVO AND, 20 YEARS LATER, IT IS JUST AS COMPELLING AND EXCITING AS THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT. ENJOY."
5,It's all about the dance,"For those who love to watch great dancers, the Fly with Me number is probably one of the greatest dance numbers ever created. As a former dancer I hate to think how long rehearsals and filming of this single number took.The opening, audition number is absolutely real. What is known as an open call in theater (or in film a 'cattle call')If you are not a fan of dance, you should probably skip this movie as there will be little to hold your interest.This is a very autobiographical film, very close to Fosse's real life."
5,Superb!,A real gem of moviemaking and entertainment!The most talented cast! Can't express my admiration for Roy Scheider and Bob Fosse work.it's a must!
4,It's nice,I love the music but it's difficult to listen to. I have to turn the volume up so high to listen that I hear a lot of background noise over the music. I don't know if it's my system or the recording but I don't have this problem with my other CD's.
3,Nine Faces of Christ,This was an interesting book. Like reading different stories of Jesus. I liked that this showed the trainings he went through. It distracts toEspecially though which is why I gave it three stars.
5,Amazon is the best!,"Techniques of Neville Page 1: Character Design -- Fantasy WildebeestThe DVD is materfull just like all of the works from this artist!But my review isn't just about this, it is about Amazon.com. I looked everywhere for this DVD and they were all sold out everywhere,I came to Amazon and they got it for me, I don't know how but they followed thru and I was so pleased, I will always check here first because they mean business and satisfing customers they are the BEST!Thank You Amazon!Ron"
3,like it overall despite it's flaws.,"I found the last season of BSG to be better than some, the ending while at least an ending was a little weak but when considered in context was par for the course, the series as a whole was more ambitious than it's creators could handle so they took it less seriously than they should have and took a lot of short cuts at the expense of quality.... worth watching though.that said the ending and final seasons of BSG are likely what killed it's sequels/prequels shortly after and before they were born."
5,Great conclusion to an awesome series,"Sadness grew as we were approaching the end of what had become a well loved series for my family. Without giving it all away, I'll just say that I loved the way it ended, it was a great way to send the series off. May BSG live on!"
5,battlestar galactica,I bought this for my husband as he loved watching the t.v. show.. He loved it as he didn't get to see all the shows.
3,can the last 15 minutes really ruin an entire series?,"excellent beginning, and middle, rushed/laughable ending. recommendation is to press stop on your dvd player when the fleet finds what they are looking for and go no further."
5,Review,Great end to a great TV show! Amazon always has the best prices too which makes it even better!
5,Awsome,"I'm a big fan of this series and was very excited to see if this final season reached my spectation. The veredict: This is awsome. From the beggining there's a lot of surprises and the last extended episode is just astonishing. That episode alone makes Battlestar Galactica one of the must gratifing television experience of my life, add the rest of this wonderfull series and you have some dvd or bluerays to buy right away."
3,"Love BSG, not paying $60 for the 4th season","Title says it all.I'd been waiting to see how they ended BSG, I'm thrilled with the series as a whole, it was the only decent entertainment on television while it aired. I made the mistake of paying double for the 2nd season, I won't make the same mistake again. I don't pay $60 for a season of ANYTHING.5 stars for the series, -2 stars for its marketing. -kd5-"
3,Just ok,This is a great series but it could have been condensed into one season. Most of the dialog is circular and the theme repetitive. It is clear that the producers preyed on the loyalty of the scifi fans to milk 4 seasons out of a simple plot. The most obvious defect is the prolonged dialog with the characters and lack of significant action. Action is what scifi fans like most. I did rate this 3 stars as a die hard scifi fan and respect for the origional series which by the way was great. If you think this is a 5 star series then you have ignored the hours of dry dialog that has nothing to do with the lost souls in pursuit of their home.
2,Give me some decent writers!,"Okay where is the science in this show? It is suppose to be a science fiction show? It looked to me, more like a war story. Surely the producers could have hired a scientist to help them out and put some in.At the start the series showed promise and I was hoping once it warned up it would get better like B5 did but instead this one went worse.Like many stories, this one failed with the writers. The acting is quite good. I thought that Mary McDonnell played well as did Edward James Olmos. Also I liked the special effects too.In 4.5, many scenes that were clearly suppose to move me did not. Several seemed a repeat of earlier ones in the show.Nor did the ending make sense. No way would an advanced civilization allow itself to collapse back to pre-stone age. Why destroy the ships?"
3,galactica on bluray,"i bought 4.5 on bluray at best buy this week, and probably WON'T be buying the rest of the series on bluray. the detail looks so crisp and clear, the cylon centurions CGI looks LESS believable than it does on regular dvd.i'm glad i didn't buy the whole series package that's coming out."
5,Good Closeout,"Solid close out to a great show. Continues to build until a very spectacular climax, easing down and filling in most of the loose ends."
3,Disappointing blue ray quality,Was really looking forward to seeing the final season on blu-ray. The resolution looks just like a regular dvd. Otherwise loved the product. Vendor delivered quickly.
4,Amazing scifi!,"I love the science fiction themes in Battlestar. The plot in complex and interesting, the conclution spectacular and sound. Well worth seeing no matter if your a fan of the genre or not. Enjoy. 8.5/10"
4,BSG is finished but I will watch the DVD's for Years,"First I loved the ending. What it did not like was the ultra slow progress since the end of season 2. My favorite characters in the show were Apollo and the Number 8 who shot Adama. In the end it was Apollo who took the bull by the horns and saved Adama and Tigh. And the number 8 who shot Adama saved their bacon to many times to count. To all the whiners who gripe about half seasons, you should have bought a DVD recorder and like me you would have a complete collection. The video quality from DirecTV was always good. Looking forward to Caprica and have watched the pilot movie 3 times now, and still picking up fine points."
5,Jeeze-give us a SEASON FIVE!!!,"I dont know what all the bitching is about-I bought season 4.1 (UK edition) and was riveted-if this is what they came up with during the writers strike-then I say more writers strikes!UNIVERSAL UK has not been as GREEDY and PIGGISH as here-all seasons have come in reasonably priced full season box sets-thought they finally couldnt resist, and Season 4 is in 2 sets, though I suspect there will be a complete season 4 box out simultaniously, along with 4.2, on June 1, 2009; Having an ALL REGION DVD player has its good points..."
4,BSG Final,"The saga was brought to a conclusion that leaves you satisfied. The stories as told in this collection make you contemplate the possibility of our beginning, beginning out there."
5,great as with all BATTLESTAR GALACTICIA,"I LOVE IT ,DOG TAGS, EXTRAS,I HAVE ALREADY WATCHED IT ABOUT 50 TIMES. SIX IS SO HOT,SO IS STARBUCK.JUST THE TYPE OF WOMEN I WOULD LOVE TO BE,ALREADY GOT THE STARBUCK TEMPER,AND PERSONALITY,WHICH MY HUSBAND LOVES"
1,the origin of man,"i am disappointed with the way the writers ended this wonderful series. maybe it's just me but i don't like stories where the origin of man is presented to us. never liked that kind of story telling. i just can't comprehend how any of the history we know today ties into the humans landing on earth thousands of years before to start again. how does their starting over create the history we know today. the roman empire, the crusades, the great wall of china, the middle east crisis today. oh well it's not like khan from star trek really was a product of the superhuman race of our 1990's. i still can watch that show with no problem so i guess with time i'll accept the prehistory of this show."
1,End Of Galactia,"Galactia season 4 was a complete waste, and how it eneded left me disappointed. I will still get season 4.5, but It's only to comptete my collection. Hopefully the Plan and Capria turnout better."
4,Not as good as the rest of the season but still good,"BSG - the new one - has been called the ""best fraking show on television"" and I have to agree with that assessment. The 4.5 season however was not quite in keeping with the quality of the previous seasons - the ending IMHO seemed to be rushed to make some sort of arbitrary ending date and had too many things to tie up and yet left many questions still unanswered."
3,A little better than previous seasons.,"These final episodes were good (for the new series that is). I never cared much for Moore's version of the show, but every now and then a spark of good comes out of his version. Still not as good as the original, but worth buying if you've already got the other seasons on DVD or Blue-Ray.The show's finale was a two-parter with part one being an hour long episode and part two being two hours long. Not much to offer in part one, but part two for the most part is excellent. The humans have their final battle with the Cylons, which is no doubt the best action-packed moments of the entire series, and finally find Earth. The show comes to a great conclusion.It's not the original, but still good."
4,Not bad for modern tv,"This show is not bad for modern tv. It has its good points and bad points, but over all it`s not bad. I consider that praise in themodern tv wasteland.The good.The acting is very good as is the directing.The writing is decent.The characters become well developed and mostly believeable.Best of all, dispite some crazy convoluted sub-plots, there is a story being told that has a beginning, a middle, and an ending.The bad.Often the show can`t seem to decide if it is space opera or soap opera. Then throw in a bunch of metaphysical gunk to really gum upthe works. All too often it seems that it`s the story line that is wondering in the wilderness instead of the characters.While the over all story and the main plot line are not bad, it is rather drawn out. It could have been told better in half thetime.Still, all in all, not bad for modern tv."
3,Half the season but at least half the price,"We don't have to talk about the content here. Just for the record: I am one of the few who did NOT like the ending.At the technical side you get business as usual: A picture that looks good on a middle-sized screen but sucks big time on 110cm LCD. If your TV is big, buy the BluRay instead. Sound is great, neighbours agree here.The set of extras is outstanding again.The only bad thing is that again it is just a half-season box but at least it was thrown out for 18 bucks before x-mas. Season 1 was a complete box set, season 2 half season boxes, season 3 complete, season 4 now again half-season. Sucks sucks sucks."
4,Finale Doesn't Disappoint but...,"The finale had emotional punch, though it didn't completely answer all of the questions introduced during the four-year run of the series. Babylon 5 had a much more satisfying multi-year story arc."
5,A great video science fiction television series,My entire family really enjoyed this television series. It was so interesting that we couldn't wait to see every episode. We bought the entire series so we could view each episode when it was convenient for us. I was surprised at the plot and the in depth story of each character. It was mesmerizing to all of us. The cast was very good and so were the enemy.This story had a strange twist but you will not find out until the end.I loved the ending--it was very inspiring. I hope you will enjoy this as much as we did.
1,Why bother with Season 4.5 and Razor if Season 4 has all these episodes?,"I love the series so far but why was a season 4.5 released if season 4 contains what would be classified as Season 4, 4.5 PLUS Razor? I should have read the newest reviews because it seems like I'm not the only one who made a double purchase of season 4 and 4.5 at the same time only to find out when I opened season 4 that it included 4.5."
1,Don't Bother,"Season One? Gold. Season Two? More gold. Season Three? Maybe bronze. Season Four? toilet paper. And the episodes get worse the longer you watch the season...Seriously, this is a season to skip. It certainly isn't worth paying for."
4,Partial Seasons are a fact,"I agree that partial season are BS. However, if you wait for the full season 4 to be released it will be very cold in Hades before you are able to buy a unified Season 4. Its called marketing and it is a great way for them to make us spend more money. Do I like it? Absolutely not. do I expect them to change? Absolutely not.BTW, this is the final season of BSG so enjoy it while you can!"
1,Boring,"Although I enjoyed the begining years of Battlestar Gallactica, it did not grow into a science fiction epic with special effects, battle scenes, etc., that I normally look forward to and enjoy ---years 4.0 and 4.5 proved me correct --- year 4.0 was so boring that I almost fell asleep in places (and I have a doctorate in philosophy) --- the last 2 seasons were filled with pseudo theological and psychological queries and scenarios that bored the heck out of me --- at times reminded me of a semi futuristic ""Grapes of Wrath"" --- I have never said this about a series that I owned before --- but it's a ""fracken waste of money"" ---"
1,"Praise for Content, Rage at Packaging","I support the series and love the content. However I will NOT be buying this or the 4.0 box set. I wil ONLY and EVER buy COMPLETE season box sets. That means all season 4 episodes in a single package.The vampires in distribution need to be weaned from this teat immediately. NO MORE split season releases. They will not sell and the rave reviews this series rightly deserves WILL be damaged by this flawed packaging nightmare. I know this negative ""number"" reflects poorly on the series as a whole, and I'm sorry, it should. Perhaps if they would also read these reviews and learn the specific cause of outrage and concern, they will properly identify the flaw in the marketing department and remove it.I will not artifiaially prop up a flawed marketing scam for the sake of an otherwise very worthy and watchable show."
3,Can we please stop this partial series nonsense?,"Sure, we've all been victimised by the writer's strike (and they had every right to it, IMO), but why postpone the inevitable complete series box?The rating would of course be higher if it had been the full series. Asides from that, up to this point (4.14) the quality has gone down IMO. Personally I dislike the infighting and would vastly prefer to continue with the storyline proper. But hope springs eternal :)From a commercial perspective it's a nice thought to get rid of the 4.0 boxes by creating a 4.5 but let's get real: anyone with a semblance of common sense will wait for the entire series."
3,"Excelent series, bad BD menus and packaging","I love Galactica since the original series.. The story line is one of the best...I got the series finale in blu ray. Horrible packaging.The Blu ray menus are hard to navigateThe Episodes are visually great...It only has DTS sound and 2.0 stereo... Where is Dolby 5.1? This is negative...If you have a Receiver without DTS, you have to play with the blu ray settings to force it to play in stereo..I was expecting a much better blu ray set..."
4,Battlestar Galactica Season 4.5,We started the whole Galactica series a year or 2 after it began and have exclusively watched it on DVD. So far they haven't disappointed us on the quality of the writing.
4,good to see,"After watching this season I was able to understand what was going on> I was pleased to see the writers put a good ending to a long story that I had enjoyed.So many shows donot have an ending or are cut before a proper ending is shown.Being 4.5 indercates that it may have been an afterthought, however well done."
4,Not Bad At All,"Three years have past, and the androids have finally arrived just as Trunks predicted, and they are wrecking havoc on an unsuspecting city. One of the androids is Dr. Gero and the other is android 19 these two are not the one's Trunks fought in the future. Later on two stronger androids come to fight they are android 18 and android 20"
2,"Ok, for the day after that trash it","it ok, for the day, it is a paper plastic and if you use it on a little one, more then likely its going to brake. if it was hard plastic it would have lasted longer. bumer..."
3,Eh...,This badge was cute but it was plastic an really big Lol i thot it'd be a little metal pin. But it is cute jus not wat i envisioned.
3,Good as part of a big overall collection,"This product was part of a larger purchase of WofOz stuff for a 4 year old nephew. He got some use out of it but it was not 4-year-old sturdy. Worth it for the pleasure it brought him at the time, not durable and appears more hearty in the pictures."
2,You're kidding right?,"I had written a review when I first recieved this item, funny? It never appeared, lets see if this one does. I thought the item was a steal at $3.99, oh my deamon greed! The postage, tax and handling was almost 2 1/2 times as much as the original item and it was only comming by US mail. TOTAL rip off, I wouldn't do it again!"
3,"Good, but...","The recipes sound good, but many lack detail. Some recipes do not indicate what size package to use. Others have additional ingredients listed in the directions instead of the list of ingredients."
2,Looks better than it is,This book is tiny. I don't know if they gave the dimensions in the listing but if they did I missed it. It could probably fit in a shirt pocket. I was disappointed.
2,"Smaller than anticipated, quite disappointed",We were disappointed with the size of the t-rex. It is the size of my pointer finger and very skinny. Just not what we expected.
2,Yawn... except for Michael Prophet,"Not creative enough for me. Even if reggae is a syncopated beat, this CD is definitely on the boring tip. Don't waste ya money."
5,"Good quality, best natural source of vitamin E","Product arrived in good condition, oil was fresh. It is pleasant tasting, kind of nutty. Wheat germ oil is the best natural source of vitamin E that you can get."
2,ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"This has to be one of the most boring videos I've ever seen. Granted, it isn't supposed to be an Academy Award winner, but they could have done MUCH better.I agree with the reviewer who said it was strangely organized. I also must add that at least some of the footage dates back to the 70's based on the appearance of the ""talent.""If you're going to: 1) operate a ""nationally known"" tactical school, and 2) produce a DVD that is supposed to represent it, SPEND A FEW BUCKS and do something other than dub some old VHS tape to DVD and jack people $40 +/- for it.This was one of the most disappointing purchases I ever made from Amazon, and a LAME effort on the part of the producers. I actually fell asleep while watching it. Look for another instructional shotgun DVD."
1,EXCELLENT VIDEO,"I was having a problem loading this dvd for a second view, but now that seems to have gone away.So now my rating goes from 1 to 5 stars. I can't get the stars to change, sorry so I guess it says 1 star but is really is 5 stars.Really informative, at a good pace. Would buy it again."
4,Meets my needs just fine,I have a small business and wanted a database software program that could help me organize information and keep track of my customers. This software product works great for me and my needs.
5,A Great Way to Learn About A Different Culture,"With all the things that are going on in the Middle East right now, The Feminine Art will give you new insights into a world we Americans know little about.Weam Namou is an excellent writer who has a gift for letting us ""see"" into the souls of her characters.I highly recommend this book.Marilyn Meredith, author of Wingbeat, the Deputy Crabtree mystery series"
2,Not what I thought,"It made me feel lightheaded, so had to stop taking it. It may have been the other products that I was taking it with."
1,Not for me,"Amazon is always great to order from and the company that filled the order got it here way ahead of time.But for me the product itself was a real disappointment. I took only one pill and will throw the rest out never to take this again.I took one (and only) pill before going outside to wash my car and about 20 min later I started to just not feel like myself at all...kind of a really strange head-rush. Also something weird, my jaw muscles started to hurt. Maybe the doseage is just too high or my system did not react well to it but it actually had the opposite effects for what I wanted it for. After the intitial rush...It kind of left me spacey and light headed for a couple of hours. Luckily, it just wore off and I was able to sleep well that night. - No thanks"
3,Ain't it funky now,"This album is touted as the type of mix you might hear if you went to club where DJ Greyboy was spinning at.So this is not his original compositions and songs. There are a few remixes on here of songs off Soul Mosaic which are different enough from the album versions that they're interesting.The majority of the songs are really funky hard-to-find obscure songs by artists that you've never heard of. Nonetheless, the man has a good ear for music.Most songs are funky and probably from the 60's or 70's. It's similar to James Brown and his Funky People.So if you're into different hard-to-find groove based funky music, I'd pick it up. It's already got Greyboy's approval.But if you're really into the newer hip hop / beats type of music, I'd steer clear, especially given the high retail price."
4,Fun if you like old movies and Agatha Cristie,"This is a classic movie for the time and lots of fun if you like old movies, as I do, and Agatha Cristie mysteries. You have to guess who is secretly killing off all the other guests trapped by a storm at a moody dark old mansion."
2,a comedy?,"This film is very interesting yet a gigantic disappointment. it has been turned into a comedy thus killing Miss Christy's original intent. Though it is based on her adaptation of her own story as a play, no one in the book is likable and there is probably not one word of comedy anywhere. If you don't care about what Miss Christy originally wrote you will enjoy this film as it is fun with many well known actors.The Russian version, with terrible titles, can be found and it is one of the great mystery films. It is very dark and lives up to the original ending of the title poem while the unfamiliarity of the actors helps immensely. And only this conclusion fits."
5,Great Movie,A Great Old Hollywood Who Done It with a million dollar cast. First saw this as a boy and never forgot it. Wanted to see it again so I bought it.
3,Not nearly as good as the book,"WE got this DVD to go with a book club selection of the book as we thought it would be interesting to see how it matched the mystery of the novel. We had seen the later version with Fabian which was set in the Alps instead of on an island. We had hoped this would follow the book better. The director took a lot of unnecessary liberties with characters' names, backgrounds, and above all the ending.We would suggest reading the book as a lot of the characters internal thinking was important to the development of the mystery as well as for giving clues to the mysterious U. N. Owen. None of this is in the movie.For those not familiar with story, ten people who have been involved in ""crimes"" difficult to prosecute have been brought to an isolated island, where they are systematically killed persuant to the poem ""Ten Little Indians."""
4,Good old days mystery,"""And Then There Were None"" is one of those old time fun mysteries that anyone can watch without fear of profanity or sleaze. The cast is top notch, the action moves seamlessly and the conclusion satisfies. I recommend it for any audience."
5,The Very Best,"I recently purchased ""And Then There Were None"" issued by Image Entertainment. There are several other companies that have issued this movie. Which one to buy?Give thanks to the review written by keveny01. I did. I won't repeat what was said other than that the conclusion was that the Image Entertainment version is of much better quality than the others. I have not seen the others, but I must say that the Image Entertainment version is of excellent quality other than the shaking of the beginning titles. If you like a classic whodunit, this is the movie, and this is the version. One does not beat Agatha Christie at her best."
5,Delightful classic with small twist,This is the delightful classic with a small twist. Great for Agathy Christie fan!
3,"10 to 1, Then There Were None","In the movie ""And Then There Where None,"" ten strangers are intentionally invited to an island called Indian Island. They all meet up and are asked to stay in a house with two maids, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers. All the strangers are not fond of each other, and start talking out of suspicion, because they don't know what's going on. During the first night, a couple of the visitors find a poem called ""Ten Little Indians"" hung up above the fireplace. While they were dining, one of the guests choked on their wine, and then there were nine. After a while, the guests catch the drift that their lives are now according to the poem. As the hours and days go on, mysterious murders are occurred and there are only a couple of them left. What are the remaining guests going to do to stay alive, you may ask? Hmm...you'll see =).I would rate this movie 3 stars ***"
5,Fun Until The End!,"I loved this movie! Although the ending is different from the book, I thought this movie was very well done and well worth the money. I did notice however some parts where the movie was supposed to taken seriously, but ended up being funny through bad lighting or whatnot. But you must realize that this movie is older, so appreciate it. The story line is very well done, and the acting is surprisingly well done. PURCHASE THIS MOVIE! I know you'll love it to death and watch it over and over :D"
4,"A VERY GOOD ADAPTATION, BUT STILL NOT IT....","I have seen this movie a few times and I liked it. But still they have the same happy ending, where Vera Claythore and Philip Lombard trick the killer and blah, blah, blah... But the movie is still the best of all American adaptations, with its spooky sets and good cast. But the music is a little bit to happy and they changed almost every single character's name and crime they commited. So if you in a mood for a fun ""CLUE"" style funny detective movie get this one. But if you really want to see the real Agatha Christie spooky and suspenseful version that was made in Russia (althuogh Vera and Lombard do make out in this one). I think that the Russian version is by far the best one. But it is very hard to get. So if you realy want it, then my only advice is... GO TO RUSSIA !"
3,Old Movie,The reason why I bought And Then There Were None is because it is my school reading assignment. The movie helped me a lot while by understanding the charcters and setting of the story. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that since the movie was so old the lips of the people speaking did not match the voices. I think Hollywood should remake this movie to fit the younger generation. The movie is a great mystery and would remcommend it to mystery lovers.
2,And Then There Were Two??,"Doesn't have quite the same ring, does it?After calling every video shop in town and not being able to find this, I ordered it from ..., and impatiently waited two weeks for my delivery. When it finally came, I ran inside, turned the lights off, watched it and... felt thoroughly cheated.Its not that its a bad movie; if I hadn't read the book I guess I would've enjoyed it. But changing the end they did totally ruined for it me. This is not the way it was supposed to be."
3,Don't expect the book,"For anybody who has read the book by Agatha Christie, don't expect it here. The movie is close, but most definitely not the book. The ending is different, half the characters are different. It is very clearly Hollywood's take. Don't get me wrong, I somewhat enjoy the movie, but it doesn't hold a candle to the book."
4,Ten Little Indians ...,I don't want to be detailed and specific in my review. I simply rented this title and enjoyed it. I remember seeing it on TV as a young girl (probably early '70s) and thinking it was so clever.
4,Excellent murder mstery,"Rene Clair's ""And Then There Were None"" is an excellent portrayal of the ten people deserted on an island (nicknamed Indian Island) that come from all walks of life, It includes a judge, doctor, secretary, detective, adventurer, maid & butler, retired general, an entertainer, and an old woman who never really has a job. One night a mysterious record accuses each guest murdered someone long ago. Although they try to prove tier innocence, thier mysterious host ""Mr. Owen"" has found a great deal about them. One by one as each person reveals that the accusation is true, the perosn mysteriously is murdered. Each murder is by way of the nursery rhyme, The Ten Little Indians. As each guest is murder, the thrilling climax leads to a murder that never actually occured. The movie closes follows each guest and adds a excellent combination of humor, mystery, and drama, unlike others."
2,"""Restored original???????""","Film has intrigued me for a long time (since I first saw it as a kid in the 40's). Even this latest DVD needs much more serious restoration than it received. Better contrasts between black and whites, but the film is still dirty and unsteady. Both problems are correctable with today's computer technology. Present issue is not worth the extra bucks. Wait for a good restoration."
2,A big disappoinment.,"If your expecting one of those classic black and white movies, with great acting, set in a eerie mansion, with heart stopping suspense and thrills, don't bother with this movie. The acting was not good and there seemed to be more comedy than suspense. This was the first Agatha Christie book I read, many years ago, and the first movie I saw based on one of her books. The movie did not compare to my imagination while reading the book. If other movies based on Christie's books are like this, I would strictly stick to reading, and not watching."
2,RUINS EVERYTHING THE BOOK STANDS FOR,"First, let me say that the book is wonderful. The movie isn't a bad movie, if you don't consider that it is supposed to be based on this book. Beacuse Hollywood has to have romance and a nice ending, they changed the ending, completely misrepresenting what the book symbolized and the chillingness of the plot. Just beware that this is what can happen when a great novel is ""Hollywood-ized"" . If you see the movie, at least read the book first, and you'll see what I mean."
4,Hollywood Ending,This is a great atmosphric British mystery with great casting and good acting. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the Hollywood ending. If they would have stuck to the ending written by Agatha Christiem the film would have been even greater.
4,And then there were none!,It has not subtitles in English or other languages.The ending is not the same as in the written version by A Christie.
4,Don't like the ending,"I read the novel and it was brilliant. What about the movie? It is right if someone said that you can't compare a book and a film. They stand in diffrent medium. It's like you compare a fried chicken and an orange juice. The movie's just like the novel. But,you know,old movies usually had short duration. So, you wont find any detail emotion of each characters and it had no time to built a mystery as thrilling as the book. And some jokes were included. It was OK. The screenwriter could write all the important parts of the novel into a 1,5 hour film. But the screenwrite made an alternative ending that made the story had a happy ending. I just dont like this ending. The novel already had the better ending. There's no need to make a twist by changing it.The DVD is okay. And it's cheap. What do you expect?"
2,Only Fair,"There are differences in this script from the book and play version, both written by Agatha Christie herself. The changes keep this movie version from being as good and suspenseful as Christie's original works. Don't try to improve upon a classic that was written by the genius of murder mysteries. It isn't a bad movie, just falls short of the originals."
2,"ANOTHER ""HAPPY ENDING"" VERSION OF A CLASSIC",Don't buy if you like the ending of the book. The other reviews said this version follows the book closely but it does'nt. What made the book such a classic is that all ten people die on the island leaving only a note in a bottle to explain to the reader how it was done and by whom. When will Hollywood finally make a real version of Ten little indians? I really don't want to see Vera and Lombard team up to take out the villain like in every version of the film I've seen. Call me picky but the other reviews are misleading.It's O.k. for three quarters but the ending makes it inexcusable. I only wish I could take it back.
3,5 star movie. 1 star quality,"A classic movie indeed. If you love a good mystery you can't go wrong here. This is one of the best. The plot is so original and fresh it has stood the test of time.If you want a watcha great movie, buy this.BUT BE WARNED - the quality of the film is sub par. The sound and the visual did not match - slightly off. If you are stickler for a quality print, be ready to be disappointed. It bothered me at first but this is such a good movie - I was willing to tolerate it."
3,Pleasing Diversion,"While not quite up to the quality of the novel upon which it is based, this little film starring Barry Fitzgerald is entertaining nonetheless. Because of the problem of bringing such a novel to the screen, the production team found it necessary to change certain of the elements of the novel. It is up to the viewer to determine if they did so effectively or not in each case."
4,Fun for a Rainy Day,"This movie is not as thrilling as the book by any means, but for a rainy afternoon with a fun ""who-dunnit?"", this movie is a real gem. True the ending is a little sappy compared with the original, but those who REALLY know Dame Christie, know that the ending she wrote for the stageplay was very much the same. All in all, not an overwhemllingly suspensful movie, but an enjoyable one nevertheless."
1,A waste of time.,"This film has nothing to do with the book. This is a comedy, not the suspenceful thriller that Agatha Christie wrote. Don't waste your time, because this film is just ridiculous."
3,Not the best print.,"This is one of the best mystery movies ever made. From the book by Agatha Christie, it's the one about ten people on an island who are being killed off one at a time. Great suspense, with a little humor. The print is not a laughing matter, however. The quality varies from fair to good; but there are better prints out there -- I have seen them.It's a good story, and can overcome the problems with the print."
2,The new Virginia Andrews of Astrology,"There's one section in the book that resembles Linda Goodman's inimitable style - the rest looks like an attempt to cash in on her name. Was Linda too trusting? We may never know. Avoid this book and reach for her Stars, Love or Sun Signs tomes instead."
1,Travesty,"I have never believed in censorship, but this book really ought to be withdrawn from the market.On what grounds?Insult to the author's memory.The only thing that's Linda Goodman in this insipid pseudo-tribute is the name on the cover... and I am willing to bet with my life that it didn't get on that cover with the owner's permission."
2,hard to understand,"i liked the fact that this book covered alot of info,but it was very hard to uderstand. so it was very hard for me to make a relationship chart for me and my boyfriend. linda goodman's sun signs is a better book."
1,Could this be ANY more complicated?,"I went to pick this up at the bookstore because I was hoping to read about my astrological compatibility between some friends and co-workers. Instead of being just the sun signs, there were moon ascendants, the ""houses"" or whatever, and to use this book correctly you would need the exact day and time the other person was born. Most of us don't know that, so this book is useless. There were also many diagrams that looked so difficult and overwhelming, so I left this one on the shelf. ""Love Signs"" was much easier to understand."
5,Use this book to uncover important relationship secrets!,"Carolyn Reynolds successfully continues the Linda Goodman tradition of making astrology accessable to the common folk in this easy to read book. Up until now, a person would have to hire the services of a professional astrologer to have access to such detailed information. Now anyone can create and interpret a personalized relationship chart by following the simple instructions outlined in the book.You'd think that you would know everything there is to know about a person after 18 years of marriage, but this remarkable book helped me gain valuable insight into my relationship with my husband.I loved the book and enthusiastically recommend it to anyone who is interested in using astrology to better understand the unseen forces that guide our most intimate relationships."
3,Not bad,"What interested me most about Linda's book was her ascendant table. At first, I thought it was wrong because it said I was a Libra and not a Scorpio rising. I looked it up, along with the decanate orb that was given. It described me perfectly! So someone above me said something like the ascendant chart was wrong, but for me, it worked perfectly. I also really like the style of the writing. It's simplistic, but it will never be like the other books. It happens to be one of my favorite books by her that go deeper into depth, not just the shallow superficiality of sun sign compatibility."
4,Wow!,"The object of the book is to make astrology simple to understand. Well, it sure is. This is definitely a must have. Everything is explained very well so that anyone can understand it. The only section that is weak, is section Four: How to Find Your Ascendant or Rising Sign. The calculation of the Ascendant is better explained in ""The Only Astrology Book you'll ever need"". That is the only reason why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5."
3,Carolyn Reynolds is a worthy successor!,"To all who love astrology I recommend Carolyn Reynold's wonderful book, The Book of Lovers. She is that rare combination of a great astrologer and a great writer - just as Linda was. And of course, all of Linda Goodman's books are fantastic and should be required reading. I do share some of the same concerns as others here - I have also been told that Linda's name is owned by a company, and that makes me very suspect. I would not trust anything else that came out posthumously with h er name on it, but I do recommend all other Goodman books, as well as Carolyn's books. I hope that Miss Reynolds will grace us with more of her astrological insights in the very near future. I think it's time to start looking at the resources we have in some of these new bright astrologers who will take over where Linda left off."
5,A Friend for Dragon,I am a nutrition associate for the University of Maine which requires me to go to a number for different schools and head start programs to teach nutrition. All of the children loved this book(A Friend for Dragoon)--actually I have to read it twice for them.
5,Great for Beginning Readers,"My sons loved Captain Underpants, so when I saw this book I grabbed it for my 4 year old, who is beginning to recognize words. He loves this book, and especially that it is a chapter book. It makes him feel grown up, like his brother. But, it is an easy reader and a superb picture book at the same time. After having heard it read to him a few times, he read it to me last night! We've read Dragon's Fat Cat also, and it too is a winner."
2,what I think,It's kind of interesting but gets really boring after a while. It's more like art for art's sake and basically refuses to get involved with anything. It is very original at first glance but after a while it's like so what... abstraction to the hilt. If you like abstract visual art with a fine sense of rarity you will like this.
5,"Excellent, clever illustrations, captivating stories","Wow. I was really impressed by this book! The illustrations were as much, if not more important to me then the story. Several of the drawings caught my attention. They really appeared so well thought out, so very artistic. I was refreshed and truly entertained by this great little masterwork. Thanks Ben."
4,A must for all writers,This is a super book. I work with writers every day- and this is the book I tell them to go buy. Every new writer needs this book. Congratulations- this book is fun and gives writers the information they need to know in today's marketplace. ...
2,An uninspired performance,"Walter Kraft's playing is technically advanced but unimaginative. Most pieces are just played along either too fast or too slowly, with virtually no climaxes. I was especially upset by his rendition of the Toccata, Adagio and Fugue in C (BWV 564). Adagio was ok, but Toccata sounded like a race just to get it over with. In the Fugue, whose very music commands it to be crystal-sharp and dance-like, the pedal registration was so heavy and muddy that it pulled the manuals down with it.I wouldn't recommend this CD to a serious music lover. However, it presents a good lesson in how to keep a steady tempo throughout a piece and could be useful as an educational tool."
5,Giddy,"This is the kind of CD you can listen to dozens of time and still get new meaning and feelings. I just completed a cross country trip with this CD and it helped both perk me up and made me think; it's been with me for meditation, celebration and relaxation. Izolda's voice is beautiful, her songs wonderfully written and expressed. Pick this up."
3,Low Dust Compared to What?,"Installed these brakes on a BMW 525I -- no issues with installation. At 350 miles, they are still squealing. I can live with that. However, the LOW DUST claim of these brakes makes me wonder -- low dust compared to what?. They produce MORE dust than my previous BMW pads. The dust is blacker and thicker. Absolutely worse than previous BMW dealer installed pads. Will never buy this product again."
1,Dont' Buy,"I bought this product not realizing how extremely limiting it was. You can't change the color on the type and the amount of text you can use is only 40 characters. Let alone the sizing capabilities are limiting...........way too much to complain about, so don't buy it."
1,they lie about the rebate,I bought this item because they advertised that they give a rebate. I submitted all the forms and the required items and they never gave me the rebate. They said that it was a duplicate. And it was surely not a duplicate. How can I send more than 1 set of original UPC and receipt. So be careful.
1,Where oh where has my little script gone????,"It has been well over a month since I ordered this script, the audition has come and gone, oddly enough the script has yet to arrive!"
5,"heart wrenching, emotional rollercoaster..","this book runs the gamut from joyous hedonism to the extreme visciousness of humankind. I cannot remember the last time I was so emotionally drawn in and captivated by such intelligent, breathing, living characters. This book is a powerful must read for anyone concerned with what makes humanity tick, and the absolute evil that seems so inherently possible. A love story that trancends all generations. This is proof that the human will is a miraculous thing."
4,Characters not developed enough but important to read,"I enjoyed this play but I found it hard to feel much emotion for the characters because they were not developed enough in my opinion. The persecution of any group of people, whether Jewish, Gay, Gypsy, or others.. is horrible and should never be condoned. I am glad that this play was written. It sheds some light, however small, on the treatment of Gays by Nazis. More should be written on this topic!"
1,Proventure,The ad did not specify that this item cannot be used for Vista and I am unable to return because the shrink wrap has been removed
2,"Tough to get on, a bit bulky, and not very good at directing the force where it needs to go.","I've tried a few of these. This one is not as bad as some but there is better out there. First, it is not a gel pad as I would expect, meaning that I anticipated a gel pad to allow placement of force directly over the correct tendon. The gel pad is the majority of the brace. My other complaint is that the Buckle tends to move to the horizontal instead of the vertical when you try to put it on. It can be a bit frustrating to do. I recommend the Champion brace. It fits well under close and you can place the pad directly on your tendon."
3,"OK, I guess.","I gained weight last winter, so I ordered a bigger waist size.Unfortunately this comes with baggier legs. Lucky I can operate a sewing machine.Oh, I also got some cut-offs, same model no. somewhere else, look the samebut no stretch stuff. These pants are made in many different ways, and youshould not assume that what you got last time in this model, or any othermodel Levis is the same as you got last time. There's no consistancy anymore.PS, None of this stuff feels like the old jeans!"
4,Nice...Nice...,"Really like the long inseam without the girth. Glad they have my size- 34X36. Get a dark color, i'm not normally a dirty guy, but these pants just seems to get mysterious off-colored-spots. I ordered the sidewalk color.."
1,Pretty sure these were fake,I have another pair of Levi's 511s and the fit with these is NOTHING like the fit with my other pair. These are way tighter at the thighs and the groin. They barely have any stretch to them unlike my other pair. Pretty sure these are not authentic Levis although I'm sure that depends on which shop you order from.
2,Does not corredpond to size,"The pants are to tight in waist area, although built quality is good.I use 38X34 all other brand jeans like, wrangler, lee, old navy, but those came too tight."
5,Nephew loves these!,I bought these for my nephew. He likes them because they are 'cool' but not skin tight. They are not the stretchy ones that cling to you like second a second skin. Good quality of course...Levis!
5,Skinny Jeans - great gift!,"I bought the red skinny jeans for my 13 year old son. He loves them (and they look good on him). He also has grey, black and blue. For those of you who haven't been clued in, Skinny Jeans are in for the young teen set!"
4,levis 511 men skinny jeans,"the jeans fit me very well. the only complain i might have is the bad quality of the craftsmanship levis is popular for.over all this jeans make you look very hot, specially becouse they don't make look like a women in slack. the only thing i don't like is the back pocket, i would prefer the 507 back pocket."
3,"3 different 511s, 3 drastically different sizes, 3 stars","I bought three 511s of different colors. One fits PERFECT (most definitely my favorite pair of jeans EVER). One of the other two shrunk a whole bunch during washing and is now way too short and the seam on the legs twists towards the front. The third is great in the legs, but way too tight in the upper thighs compared to the other two. The worst pair of jeans was made in China. The other two were made in Cambodia.Honestly, it is worth the risk. I found one incredible pair of jeans (Sky Blue) even if the other two are just passable... Levi's quality is very bad. Unfortunately, since I am tall and skinny, it is hard to find a company (like Levi) that produces slim jeans in my size."
5,Perfect For The Skinny Guy,"Yup, these rock. Fit is almost perfect, and my 34""'s are longer than stated. Only issue I had was the waist was a little loose after quite a few washes. I just wear a belt. I always do cold water, inside out and hang dry. Going to try to soak the waist into shrinking. Also they're quite a bit cheaper on Amazon than at the Levis store at the mall. One caveat: I've caught girls, you know...staring (I didn't know girls did that), so I've dubbed them my ""sl*t jeans"" and decided they're inappropriate for work."
1,Levi's changed the sizing,"I have been wearing the 511 Skinny Jeans for few years now, and the pairs I have fit great but have shown their age. Levi's recently changed the fit of these jeans, they are now smaller and skinnier than the previous design. My most recent pair I purchased about a year ago, and just picked up two more pairs last week. They are both the same style # 045113619 however the new jeans have updated tags and labels. This is very disappointing that Levi's would all of a sudden change these, as they have fit me perfect in the past and I can no longer fit into the new design."
5,Good Quality,I love it.Stretch design with rubber.pure black colour.really skinnySlim fitshipped on timeworth for money.
3,Not as slim as I would have liked,"The wash and the quality of denim is great, my only gripe is Im a pretty slender guy, so I was a little disappointed that from the knee down the pant leg was not near as tapered as I needed them to be. Im going to have to tailor them a bit. This is a little suprising becasue I bought the 511 trousers in Tan (Kangaroo) and Grey (Revolver) and both of those fit more like they should and are tapered perfectly, but these to my chagrin, are not. You're probably better off going with the 510 in the same or simliar wash. Again, it has nothing to do with the quality of jean, but rather how ""slim"" this particular pair of slim fit jeans are. For me personally, not slim enough."
3,Item received in good condition,"Everything was okay, except that the color doesnt seem like rigid grey. But well, it is a good deal. :)"
2,Not so skinny,I was thinking they would be a nice skinny jean cause Levi never lies but there more of a boot cut :(
5,EXCELLENT FIT,"These jeans arrived on time and fit perfectly! Do not be fooled by the name as they are not too skinny, but fit more like jeans used to fit before the ""baggy look"" became popular."
1,not the best,thin material and they are about one size smaller than the regular skinny jeans. so tight for sure is what you ll get
2,Did not fit and had to return.,"The quality seemed ok. Length was fine. But the waist was way off; I couldn't come close to buttoning it. This is curious because I've always found Levi 511s consistently true to size when I purchase them in a brick-and-mortar establishment, which is just what I did after I popped these back in the mail to Amazon.I would've only given this product one star but for the fact that Amazon's return policy is so ridiculously easy and convenient."
3,No size the same,Bought 4 pairs of pants in just different colors. 4 different waist and 4 different inseams for the same style. Ridiculous. No wonder Levi's are dieing out.
2,"Good color (3D Grey), but bad length size","I have ordered 2 of these 511 jeans before and the size 32x30 was almost the same as the 32x32, a little bit long for me, then I ordered the 32x29 in order to try, and it's ridiculously short. So, it seems these levi's jeans have certain inconsistency in the lenght sizes."
1,Baggy NOT skinny,"These 'skinny' jeans were baggy. Plainand simple...Not buying Levi's jeans on lineanymore, there being too much variation betweenthe stated size and reality...."
4,"Finally Found 29"" Waist Men's Jeans!","I'm a tom-boyish, horse-riding woman who, though I have adequate curves in all the proper places, prefers men's jeans. I checked a number of name-brand sites and came up empty for 29"" waist, skinny-leg jeans... ""youth"" tends to stop at 27"", men's start at 30"". Amazon.com came through for me with a pair of Levi's, and at a sale price. They fit great; I'm delighted."
3,you get what you pay for,"I have many many pairs of jeans and pants. I feel like these Levi's are a decent pair, but they are definitely not my favorite. I you want a nice pair of skinny jeans, not too tight - but still form fitting, these are not the jeans for you. Unless you have a massively sized butt, or pull these jeans up to your belly button, the back of the pants will be sagging around the pocket. I do wear these jeans, but I think of them as my 'fat pants'. If I am dressing to impress or want to look chic, I choose a different pair of jeans (pacsun's bullhead skinny jeans are really nice)."
3,3d ONYX is tighter an smaller,"I got the 3D onyx black color.I'm usually 30 x 30 or 31 x 30,but the black 3D onyx was wayyy to tight and rigid. Very uncomfortable.I'm definitely 511 Levi size, but these are a lot smaller.I'd recommend ordering up a size if you get that color,the color was shiny, rich, and the material was rigid and nice.But I was looking for something more along the lines of Black stretch,I like the stitching on them though, orangish gold stitching."
3,not like the old jeans,"Why don't they make jeans like they used to? These are okay but definitely not the quality, feel or even look of ""real"" jeans.."
2,Sizing is off!,"My son buys nothing else but Levi's, but to his disappointment, the sizing on these jeans is not accurate. Three other men in our family with a 32"" waist tried them & they were too tight. Now, the larger sizes are sold out"
2,Shrink away,"My son ordered 2 pairs of these jeans. They fit great on arrival, but by the time they were washed (cold water) and dried (low temp) they had shrunk to high waters. Would not order them again. I suppose companies think its great, expecting you'll buy them frequently. Forget it. I'll go back to tried and true every time. What is so difficult about pre-washing and drying the material to prevent shrinkage after fabrication? Isn't quality worth customer satisfaction? Of note, as a woman I have not bought a pair of Levi's in years. At 5'9"", 135 lbs. and needing a 33"" inseam, I cannot find a pair in stores or online that fits. Plenty of shorts and mediums out there but forget finding talls. When you do find the odd pair it is usually an odd style and only a 32"" inseam anyway--shrinkage always a problem."
5,511 Skinnys,Very comfortable jeans!* Does not shrink in wash.* Love the low waste line and holds my phone devices very well* Color is awesome!* Takes my thicker belts very well!
2,The fabric was strangely weird. (Clean Dark version),"I purchased the 511 Clean Dark version of these jeans. The fit was exactly what I expected from the jeans, but the fabric was weird and sort of burlap-y. The color was an excellent dark color, but the legs are already fading and it's been like 1 week. I'm afraid to wash them ever because I'm sure it'll fade like crazy. Not a huge fan of the jeans. I'd just recommend going to a store and buying them there."
5,Quality jeans.,"Quality jeans, great color, doesn't fade, just great quality generally. I'd reccomend 'em. They're a bit costy, though."
1,wrong sizing,"I bought the same size i have bought in levis many other times, but this time the sizing was totally wrong and the jean dont fit, is smaller !!! the label is wrong ... and i have not gained weight !!!!!"
2,Don't fit like 511's,"Like other (negative) reviews, the jean color in the picture was different than what I received. The picture of the chain link color shows a blue pair of jeans but I received a gray pair. However, the label on the jeans do say chain link. I ordered a 28x30, like all my other Levi's 511 skinny pants but these didnt fit like them. They fit more like very skinny jeans, like the kind on the Miller Lite commercial. The waist size was correct and did fit like 28 should. Levi's is at fault for not keeping the all sizes at a standard. I will be returning them."
3,The new 511s,"I ordered these because I already had a pair of 511's that are awesome. I was very excited to find the cheap price and the variety of colors so I ordered a new pair in the same size as my other 511's. The new 511's are wayyyyyy skinnier than my older ones and i think it has to do with the increased % spandex. I checked my old ones and they were 1%spandex, 99% cotton. The new ones are 2% spandex, 98% cotton but it sure makes a difference in the fit. Like I said these are very skinny jeans. Hopefully they loosen up a bit with some wear.Fast shipping though!"
2,"Jeans without elastane, no stretch.","The seam line of jeans was black instead of light color, as was reported in the photo. The jeans had not elastane and it was not clear in the ad."
3,nothing but levis,I wear nothing buy levis. I have been ordering levis but this color clean dark I don't like the way behind the knee it looks wrinkle. I sent one pair back for that reason.
2,Wrong picture of item.,"Bought these jeans thinking that i was going off of the picture for ""tumbled night"" wash. It was not. This color is closer to the ""gray"". Its an ugly half black half gray quality. I was hoping these would have the colored stitching and all that. The fit is great besides this. 100 percent cotton with no spandex or stretch. Im extremely disappointed in the color. Dont let amazon fool you this is more of a Gray wash. In the future i would go with the Rigid dragon wash or clean dark."
5,Levi's,Levi's Skinny 511 Jeans in Black (Stretch) - Ships in ''24'' Hours!These jeans were so popular they were hard to find at a good price. Finally I found them on Amazon.com at a very good price with excellentservice from Amazon. My grandson is very happy with them!
5,511 sLIM,WITHOUT QUESTION THE BEST FITTING JEANS I HAVE EVER OWNED. MOST JEANS FOR SKINNY GUYS ARE USUALLY BIG IN THE REAR END OR WIDE IN THE LEGS. THESE ARE PERFECT. I'VE BOUGHT 3 PAIR IN DIFFERENT COLORS. GREAT!
1,Sizing incorrect,"I am so sad and disappointed in these pants. The pants are not true to size. We ordered a 30x32 and they are more like a 28x30. I assumed since they are made by Levi they would be accurate size, but they are not even close."
3,"""Rigid"" and Inconsistent","I purchased 2 Levi's 511 jeans - one in Seaweed and one in Tumbled Night. Both were size 31x30, but the Seaweed pair was significantly baggier than the Tumbled Night jeans. Also, the Tumbled Night jeans had a ""Rigid"" tag on them which stated that the jeans need special care, but few other instructions. After some googling, I found that ""rigid"" may mean that the jeans are made from ""raw denim"" - they were not washed before being sold, which basically means they may lose some color in a wash and will probably shrink (which would have been bad for me because these jeans definitely fit smaller than 31x30 to begin with). I also called a local Levi's store - they said that ""rigid"" jeans should be dry-clean only.To wrap up, even though I like the jeans, sizes are inconsistent and Amazon should really describe the Tumbled Night color as being ""rigid."""
4,Levis 511 Chain link color: slightly looser,"i own 2 pairs of 511 levis and i love how they fit. the length and with of the legs are just wat i want, so i went ahead and bought these levis because i needed jeans in color grey. i have no complains in the color or quality but i was expecting these jeans to fit just like the other pairs i own, however even though they are the same size (29x30) these grey (chain link) levis came out slightly bigger both in length and with. i wish they would have fit the same as my other levi's because then i would have been 100% satisfied, but either way its not THAT big of a deal."
1,Far from expectations,I wear 34/34. To fit my size I should of order 36-38 waist and nt the 34 i did. Looks like a joker. terrible.
2,Deceptive Sale,"Levi's Men's 511 Skinny Denim Blue JeansI chose the model Men Levis 511 Skinny Blue Denim Jean because in describing Web Amazon indicates that this pant is made &#8203;&#8203;in Mexico and have had experience of buying in the same country and have been highly satisfied with the quality of them.I applied 3 pants and when I received my order of the three only one is pants made &#8203;&#8203;in Mexico the other two are made in Cambodia and China.The Levis made &#8203;&#8203;in China is not the same quality as made &#8203;&#8203;in Mexico and therefore in my country you can buy in any market unless menial price. It is for this reason that I am not satisfied with the purchase.If in the future I want to buy on Amazon Web a perfume made &#8203;&#8203;in France, for example, no one would like it done in Panama not know the product and may not be the same quality."
3,stiff jeans,"These jeans came very stiff. I had to soak in fabric softener, and rub with sandpaper. Still a bit stiff."
2,too skinny!!,"it looks great on the picture... but it was actully way to skinny... Im really thin, and I couldnt buckle it."
1,511 Skinny!,The picture is very different than the real product. The jeans were VERY SKINNY. They are extra slim.
1,Word,First I tried these pants on in my size and I looked like Kramer in that episode where Jerry dares him to wear jeans. It was ridiculous. I went back to the store and bought them a little bigger and they are the best pair of jeans I've ever owned.
5,satisfaction,"After pulling out a trousers to see unexpectedly is made in China. Put them on a look very satisfied, cultivate one's morality version of cutting my legs look very slender."
5,Levi's Skinny Jeans,"Very good jeans ,order for my 15 years old son.But in my opinion he grew up or size was small. I'll order these jeans one size bigger!"
5,He loves the Skinny Jeans!,"I ordered these jeans for my teenage son and he was very happy with them. As with most Levi's, they are comfortable and fit very well. We were also pleased with the company because they shipped them quickly and we received exactly what we ordered. We will definately order from them again!"
5,Great skinny jeans,Our 17 year old son now has three pair of Levi's 511 jeans in different colors. He loves them. The 2% lycra makes them more comfortable and flexible than 100% cotton jeans. I just wish all the colors were available for Amazon prime shipping. I had to pay more for the black jeans and then shipping as well.
5,Fits perfectly!,I already had one of these 511 jeans so I knew it would fit perfectly and it did! It's 100% original Levis so don't be afraid to purchase these bad boys! they feel great!
5,Excellent fit & feel!,These are even better than what I anticipated. The washed look is perfect and the feel is excellent. I'll be buying more of these in other colors.
4,Got the wrong jeans,"Got the wrong jeans, I ordered the Tumbled Night and they sent the gray. It was similar so I was satisfied after all"
4,like it,i have been like it.. comfortable and just right size but it would be nice to have a 31x29 ..
3,Check Fabric Weight: to know which one you want.,"These are good jeans. But you should understand why levi's fit differently even among the same line. I ordered these (3d Grey, 511) looking for a nice thick denim however this pair was really thin (not what I wanted). I did some research and found that each line of levi's (511, 514...) has colors that are different materials and weights. I returned the 3d Grey, all cotton, and ordered a pair of Rigid Dragon which are heavier, yet also has some elastic. I really like the ones I have now."
4,They're skinny jeans,"I've just received these in the mail and they're the first pair of skinny jeans I've owned. Like many of the other customers have stated, these jeans fit small so you should order a larger size to accommodate. They're much tighter than I thought they would be, and that's because I've been wearing normal cuts my entire life. My biggest problem with my order is that the picture of the jeans i ordered is not the same as the ones I was shipped. I ordered Tumbled Night, but it might as well have been gray. I'm okay with either color, but I was kind of disappointed. Finally, on the details page for the jeans it says that these jeans are made in Mexico, but on the jeans it says that they were made in China. This may be the reason for the size difference and the color change.TL;DR They weren't the right color, they fit small, and they're made in china."
5,Another Great Rob Bell video,Rob Bell is always thought provoking. His videos are well done. These are great for small group discussions or personal growth.
4,good tour,"This is one of Bell's home runs. He brings Jesus down to earth, where He walked and fleshed out humanity the same way we do."
3,"Good workout, if you like push ups","In this DVD, C.J. Caracci guides you through an intermediate level workout. The workout is not very fast paced, as Caracchi explains every move, giving you a brief rest between exercises. As this workout is intended for Real Men, there is no dancing moves or jumping around involved, and they use machine guns, parachutes and the like as props to give you the ""authentic Navy SEAL feeling"" during the workout.The workout consists mostly of jumping jacks, push ups, abdominal work and stretching. The film gives you a very good workout, but there would have been room for more variety of exercises. Most of the exercises are probably familiar to you from PT classes at school, and you don't need any exercise equipment to run through this workout. Along with physical exercises, Caracci gives you some pointers on mental toughness as well.The production of the film is pretty OK. There is nothing special, but everything works just fine."
1,DVD quality atrocious!,I ordered this DVD expecting to get a solid workout but was disappointed to dicover the quality of the program to be ridiculously subpar. Perhaps the exercises are decent as the other reviews attest but the sound quality is so awful you have to turn the volume up way high to hear anything this guy is saying. I could make a better DVD than this on my PC and am SHOCKED this product is sold for $30!!! Unbelievable! I am in the process of trying to return my copy and praying amazon will take it back....Don't buy this!!
1,"Worth 50 cents, if that","All this is is one guy (yes, one) doing his exercises in front of a cheap video camera (or did he film it on his camera phone?). Let me save you 30$ with this tip: do a lot of pushups. That's all that you will get from this dvd. Oh, and the guy must have had a big accident during the filming. He has a bloody, scraped thigh during the second half of the workout."
3,Left in the Dust,"As at least one other reviewer noted, this album is a very inexpensive way to pick up a comprehensive set of Saint-Saens' orchestral music with violin and cello soloists. And as that same reviewer and others have also noted, the performances of the better works in this set have since been surpassed by subsequent recordings, so much so that my only reason for possibly suggesting purchase of this release is its price. As an alternative plan, I would go with another reviewer's recommendation of Phillipe Graffin on Hyperion for the violin concertos and then find recordings you like of the Havanaise and Cello Concerto No. 1 -- I don't have personal recommendations for those."
4,Darren d.,Father Murphy season one. a good clean show and a good price for this dvd . i like the show back in the 80`s and i love it now don`t see show like this no more. IT`S a feel good show to see. IF YOU LIKE A GOOD SHOW YOU NEED THIS ONE. thank you.
5,Father Murphy Season 1,"This is a good heart warming series for the whole family. My family watched the whole thing and then started over and watched it again. Good, Clean viewing and a lot of morales . I would reccomend to anyone who is tired of what is available on tv today"
1,BOOTLEG WARNING,This Item is a bootleg version of the dvd. It is highly recommended that you DO NOT purchase this item! Great deal or not if you are a true fan you should understand that purchasing bootleg items hurts the anime industry!
5,Really great find!,"This is by far one of my favorite animes! This DVD is a great find and it also comes with a bonus CD with rocking tunes. I highly recommend this item. I haven't seen a lot of DVDs like this before so this probably one of the best finds, sometimes the subtitles mess up but it happens rarely."
1,Why do they still allow him to write?,"How can someone get something so wrong, and yet still have apologists who defend him, and believers who buy his books?There's lots of money to be made in Doomsday predictions if you can rationalize taking the money from the fools that will buy your pitch. This books predicts the world will starve to death due to overpopulation. Only problem, the predictions were made decades ago and they were all wrong. We're still here.Maybe he can write a book on global warming..."
1,Julian Simon is the master of this Topic,"As a fifth grader I was convinced and very scared by Ehrlich's predictions. I became very interested in the environmental issues that Ehrlich helped make popular. However, upon studying the subject in greater detail I realized that a free society is best prepared to deal with any environmental issues. The facts and research uncovered by Julian Simon convinced me that wealth created by human being helps the environment. Poverty (which is caused by government regulation and totalitarian states) is the biggest threat to the environment. All of Ehrlich's predictions have been shown to be shortsighted and wrong. Read ""Population Bomb"" but only if you follow it by reading Julian Simon's ""The Ultimate Resource"", otherwise you will be gullible to the scaremongering politicians warnings that you must give up your individual freedoms in order to save the planet."
1,A Reverse Cassandra,"Cassandra was able to foresee the future but was cursed in being unable to make anyone listen to her. Ehrlich has never been right and people keep on listening to him.Had Ehrlich's 1968 predictions in ""The Population Bomb"" been right, we would now be stumbling around in a sea of smog killing one another for the few scraps of food we could find. On the other hand, had we adopted the draconian measures Ehrlich proposed in ""The Population Bomb"", the environment might be as good as it is now and Ehrlich would be declaring victory. However, the price we would have paid in individual liberty and standard of living would have made it a hollow victory."
1,Ehrlich fails to see that technology innovation isn't static,"In the predictable style of most misanthropic environmental doomsayers, Ehrlich conveniently forgets that humans are capable of confronting pressing problems with technological and social innovation, as though we're all doomed to live in the 1970s (or the present) forever. People who think Earth is about to be depleted of its resources might want to check out books like ""Mining the Sky"" by John Lewis. There are enough resources in space to support us for a long time. And yes I know we don't yet have the capability to get to them yet but there's no law of nature that says we can't eventually."
1,Erhlich = Hitler,"I agree with the reader from South Dakota (review dated January 23, 2000 below) Erhlich's views can be equated to Hitler's, both would preffer to eliminate all the people that they dislike. How ironic that Erlich's fans finally unmask him as the monster he is. What we need is more people with the education and opportunities to be productive."
1,"The Population Bomb, a bomb of a book","Paul Ehrlich's book ""The Population Bomb"" is a terrible book. Ehrlich is never clear about what he believes, and moves from one emotional position to another, never realizing that he has no idea what he is talking about.Writing in 1969 he predicted massive famines starting in 1984. Of course this didn't happen. So did Ehrlich question his assumptions? No, he simply reisses an extremely flawed work. If you want to know what was wrong with the 1960s just read this book along with Reich's ""The Greening of America.""For what it matters, Ehrlich did his undergraduate work at the University of Kansas, where I went to both undergraduate and graduate school."
1,The Liberal Bible,"And in keeping with the Liberal tradition, it has been proven wrong on every count..."
4,In Defense of an Insightful Classic,"Currently posted reviews of this book (all one-star) miss the mark in disturbing ways. We can all agree that in a quantitative sense, Ehrlich was wrong about some things. Does that negate the books import? Of course not, and those who heap abuse on it are tragically misguided. The processes discussed in The Population Bomb are very real, and need our attention. The point is, the book was very influential and without question helped mitigate some of the problems it examined. Subsequent books by the Ehrlichs discuss why things haven't turned out so catastrophically...YET. Anyone who thinks that overpopulation isn't a problem, or that Earth's resources are unlimited, is quite simply too ignorant to appreciate the gravitas of this work. Been to Ethiopia lately?"

1,YUCK,Piece of JUNQUE that does more harm than good!Decides on its own when to switch to battery anddoes THAT quite often for NO CAUSE. BEWARE!
1,I am disappointed,"This item arrived with a dead battery in it. I cannot unscrew the bottom plate so that I can see what kind of battery it needs because the screws are stripped. I have spent two hours on it so far and still cannot get the plate to budge. So I have a dead backup battery. I am concerned about backup for my computer, but cannot afford to take another chance that might end up like this."
2,The other reviewers are right...,This UPS was a gift & used on a basic Dell desktop. It has reached the end of it's life after two years. Batteries cost more than the replacement of this unit. Another electronic item destined for the local landfill.
1,WUT WUZ DIS!,The first ppv wit one raw belt and one smackdown belt! IT WAZ DUMB! ONly good match wuz HHH and RVD! But i still almost fell asleep!
4,Good PPV,"This PPV was one of my favorites ever, i just loved the Angle vs Benoit match, but some 'fans' say it was a boring match, but this one is a good example of those matches that DON'T NEED BIG BUMPS or anything, excellent technique by both of them and proving that technical wrestling in my opinios is WAY BETTER than hardcore wrestling (i agree with Ric Flair about hardcore wrestling is an alternative for those wrestlers that can't do anything), the Lesnar vs Undertaker match was also one of my favorites, in my opinion this match was better than the Hell in a Cell they had at No mercy. Triple H vs RVD was a little bit boring but hey, Triple H is a better champion than RVD can ever be."
3,"Good event, that was faulted by the last two moments",WWE Unforgiven 2002 was a pretty good event. My two favorite matches were Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit. The two problems I had with the show were Lesnar vs. Taker which was a bad and boring match. And The HLA that ended with nasty old Rikishi giving Bischoff the stink face.
3,Elementary Statistics,"I would have liked to have known the edition of this book. I should have contacted the seller to find out this information. It was the wrong edition for my class. Basically I wasted my money purchasing it. And, as a student, I really cannot afford to do that. I have learned from my mistake.The item cannot really be rated because it was not the right one for my purposes."
4,Elementary Statistics: A Step by Step Approach,"The book arrived early, which is greatly appreciated. The condition of the book, however, is kind of old, not ""like new"" as described in the amazon's website."
5,A new york reader,"David Means allows his reader to begin to comprehend what utter disposession from the world and from oneself would be like. A process like this allows for pure emotion so inundated with pain and suffering, that so few of us ever allow ourselves the luxury - it would be all too engrossing. Means' stories are not only a deadly ride through the railyards - they reflect what so many of us feel but cannot express."
3,Skilled writing but something is missing,"This is tough stuff. Not for the uninitiated. Life is indeed cruel and people can be nasty beyond what we care to think about. I get it - Means wants us to see all of this head on. And he is skilled, even artful. Despite the relentless bleakness of these stories, and they are indeed jarringly, intrusively dark, and perhaps honest to how cruelty happens, somehow they still skim on the surface rather than getting below for causes, motivation and the illumunation of character. Dark is not always deep and light is not always shallow. Something valuable is missing here."
5,A Masterpiece,"A perfect, concise, thirteen stories that never fail. As Jonathan Franzen states of the book's jacket, this is one of the ""best books of the past ten years."" In the post-bombing aftermath, these stories never fail. They are about human trials, the pain of loss, and the redemption of the truth. I felt, reading them, that I was being taken into the heart of the human experience. Means is daring enough to write about deeply complex and troubled lives. He never cops out. It's no wonder this book won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize last year and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle. They saw what I did. A great book."
2,OLD NEWS,This book is full of ideas but is out of date (when it was publihed) I belive that Govenments have used this book and have mad thing harder. STRIKE please don't wright another one they do take note.
3,"Like most people, this book is imperfect but necessary:","Would that it were otherwise! The fact is, no other commonly available reference is as handy and easy to use; and while the pictures leave much to be desired, this book has more useful color pictures than any other. It has helped me become familiar with the most common EAPG patterns, but since I know it's full of mistakes I don't accept its information uncritically. I wish the authors would clean up their many sloppy errors in future editions, even as I look forward to the book's expansion. This book is helpful, but I use mine alongside McCain's vastly more authoritative, reliable work."
2,"A beautiful book, but lacking!","Suppose you do not know much about glass. You probably won't know a whole lot more when you've looked at this book. Some of the pictures do not show the pattern. There are numerous ones, ie.; caprice, chestnut oak, star & thumprint, etc. that are taken at poor angles, or poor lighting or whatever and are just indisctinct. I was looking for a pattern on Cathedral and that is shown on a bowl that has the pattern going underneath. No way can you see what the entire pattern looks like. In the front of the book, they describe the shapes of the glassware. They list 20 shapes, but in the price guide, they list many more. What is the difference between a milk pitcher and a pitcher? a tumbler and a goblet? What size and shape is a sauce? What is a wastebowl? They never show or describe the bottom pattern. No explanation is given as to whether this is important, distinct or has no effect whatsover. I have no more knowledge of the patterns on my glass than I did before."
2,flashy but ignorant book,"Nice pictures and easy layout attract beginners (like myself), but about 30% of patterns do not quite correspond to the descriptions and incorrect. Historical facts are awfully wrong throughout the book.How could the authors release this book? And why was it reprinted without corrections?"
4,Good buy,"I bought this product for fun and it worked out almost perfectly. The only let down is that there is no push to talk feature but it's still a great product. It's small, lightweight and loud just like the product description says. People's expressions are well worth the 30 bucks it cost after shipping. I highly recommend it."
3,does the job,"I bought this product to use on a school bus. Does the job I needed, speaking loud enough for the back of the bus to hear. I have only had this about a month. Hope the product holds up, but for now it is a help."
1,Poor quality,"Good price and for the few minutes it worked, adequate volume for my purposes. But stopped working almost immediately."
2,too small,"I didn't realize that they made such a model: small and not sufficiently powerful. The savings realized in this model wasn't worth it, especially when you add shipping costs. Don't buy it."
5,Everyone should have one,"Stylish, small, lightweight, loud. Got it for my father. The look on my mothers face when he opened was worth 10X the price of this gem."
2,Not loud enough,"This megaphone was temperamental. The volume wasn't there and it seemed to fade in and out with static. And when it tried to make it louder, the unit started chirping. The siren worked well though. Maybe I had a defective model. I'm going with a more reliable unit."
5,Works Great,"Cant beat the price, works great, its light, spreads the voice at least 100 yards even in a forest, and no complaints!"
4,the first that I've read...,"This book, being the first that I've read from the author, was great in it's own sense. The author does very well with the storyline and the conflicts but I felt that maybe there could have been a tad more character development. I guess because this is a novel that is part of a series, and it is a MacAllister novel, she assumes that the reader has been introduced to everyone in the family. I have not and was a little confused with all of the family names. Maybe I should just go and read all of the novels concerning this family and it will all come together, I am sure of it. It was a nice read for me, being stuck overseas."
2,Not for beginners!,"I am an undergraduate electrical engineering student. I have 2 years of math (basic calc through ODE) and got an A in general physics. I wanted a book that would introduce the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian techniques and prepare me for more advanced physics, and this is not that book. As another reader pointed out the implied summation notation is confusing and gets in the way. The author also defines most concepts using generalized coordinates (instead of say... cartesian coordinates), which is cool if you are applying the concepts to complicated systems and need generalized coordinates, but I think it confuses the actual physics that are going on, at least for the beginner. Perhaps this is a great reference, but I do not see how you could learn the topic of classical mechanics from this book unless you are already very good at math, physics and mechanics to begin with."
1,Dreadful,Bought the book based upon the glowing reviews and got burned.The book employs cryptic notation and lacks examples. It makes the simplest concepts confusing.If you are a physics professor and already know the subject inside and out and want a book to torment students with -- this book is the one.
5,Debussy at His Best,"This is a wonderful selection of Debussy piano music. Frankl's touch is precise and gentle. Fans of Debussy, or anyone who enjoys listening to the piano, will enjoy this purchase. I must also say that this is a remarkable price for 2 CDs and over two hours of music."
3,A good deal,"If you're looking for a great performance of a specific Debussy piano piece, this CD set may not be for you. Frankl's interpretations, while good, are not the best out there. However, if you are looking for an all-around good performance of the COMPLETE Debussy piano music, then these CDs are an extremely good deal; for $10 you probably won't find much better than Frankl's fine playing."
3,Motorcycle Gang 1994,"This film was ok,not that bad for motorcycle movie,Jake Busey makes a pretty good bad guy ,bad guys all get whats coming to them ,from TV's Major Dad,(Gerald McRaney)."
2,Not the best book on the subject,"This book is a short tour of the world of mathematics. Although some footnotes are adjourned up to 1994, the first edition of the book was published in 1956 (under a different title) and the style of the book is obviously antiquated. The author seems to be undecided between delivering an advanced excursus in most important mathematical application and presenting a collection of mathematical trivia-jokes-games. I don't think the mix works well. Besides, in line with this contradiction, sometimes the author dwells into explanations of elementary concepts, but then he takes for granted that the reader is familiar with integrates and calculus. Only to make things worse, some mathematical puzzles (perhaps the most interesting) are given without the solution. Although admitting that the writing style is intelligent and communicative and that it is rich in accurate references, I found many flaws in this book."
3,Generic battery,The battery won't fully charge even after following the manufacturer's battery recalibration guidelines on their website (Battery Technology). Only four out of the five LED lights on the side of the battery indicate that its roughly 80% charged (88% according to the power meter in Windows). It still lasts around 2 to 3 hours using typical office apps which for me is acceptable.
2,Roll-A-Lotion,"Great idea, ok execution. The roller beads scratch my back and aren't that soothing. Is there aNew and improved version?"
1,Very poor quality,"In the past 5 months I have owned 4 of these. Three I purchased and one was replaced by the retailer. The plastic where the threads on the lotion holder is so thin it cracks and falls off within a month. The plastic where the handle slides into the lotion holder is also thin and cracks. It does this consistently in all four cases. I bought one of these about four years ago and it lasted 3 1/2 years. I thought the first three recent purchases were individual cases, they weren't. I talked to the manufacturer, Jobar, and they denied a problem. It is made (you guessed) in China."
5,Reach a hard place,"With my arthritis, its impossible to reach all the places on my back with lotion. At any age we need to use lotion every day -- especially with the sunscreen factor -- and this is the only reach-stick I've found that really works -- it hits all the places and delivers enough lotion to do the job completely. Its a bit fragile, so I keep it in a safe back-of-the-shelf place because if it drops, it will break. I like that the cover keeps the lotion from drying out between applications."
2,"Genius, but poor quality","I live where the humidity is often 4%. I've tried pads and hard plastic devices to apply body lotion (or sun tan lotion) but they must be well cleaned daily not to become quickly gunked up from dried on lotion. This is the first applicator I could use that didn't require such maintenance as the lotion is sealed inside when not in use. Quality is the only problem. I've owned four of these over the past five years and they're all gone now. One handle broke, balls kept permanently falling out, and heads repeatedly fell off spilling lotion everywhere. It was very frustrating but a common problem with products ""as seen on TV."" What else would you expect for 5 bucks? What was a person to do? Answer: spend more. SeeHydas Body Creamer Skin Care Set, White/yellow- same genius but much better made."
5,Very much needed item,Works great! I use it every day in the winter time so I can apply lotion to my back.
2,roll-a-lotion applicator ineffective,Most of the lotion you apply gets caught between the rollers. I'm going to order another one with a flat pad that will spread the lotion more consistently.
3,Could be better,If the lotion is a thicker lotion it does not come out unless you hit the applicator against something like the bed. It is a great idea though and I think I will have to try it with some thinner lotion. It would be good to have two interchangable heads - one for spot applications and one for the whole back.
2,Cheaply MAde,"Good idea but bad production. THe head is not secure enough to withstand use, it constantly falls off putting lotion on the floor. Also the balls are plastic and get jammed after one use"
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this with the hopes of putting lotion on my back. Well it worked for about a week, before it clogged up. I had to clean and wash it every few days, and waste lotion that would get dried in the rollers. Some of the roller balls had sharp edges, which would be fine if you wanted cat scratches on your back."
2,not worth it,"The beads are not finished and have a rough line from where they were formed, they're rough and scratch, not at all what you want on skin suffering from dryness. The only good thing is that it does actually work to dispense the lotion."
5,Wonderfully useful item!!,This is my second purchase of this item. The previous one lasted more than 5 years. Once in a while a ball would fall out (as others have reported) but never very often and always popped right back in. I live in a VERY dry climate and need lotion on my back ALL winter. This is the PERFECT item!!
2,Very poor construction/plastic,"I've had 3 of them now and they have all broken on me. Very poor construction. The plastic is just not sturdy at all. It's a great idea, but very poorly made."
2,roll a lotion applicator,It has to be filled up with a lot of lotion and does not work well in winter. The removable handle makes it easy to travel
5,"Dry skin, no help?","Buy one of these for those hard to reach places. Saves my skin in the Northeast winters. It's my second one, don't drop."
2,"Great idea, but this is the 3rd one that breaks","It is a great idea, but the lotion holding part of this contraption keeps cracking, resulting in the little balls falling out and not being able to use it anymore."
5,Exactly what I wanted,Whoever invented this was SO smart. I am forever in your debt - now I can get cream on those impossible places to reach on my back!! Thank you!!!
1,what a terrible product!!,"Fill it up with lotion and then try to use it. The little balls don't turn. If the little balls don't turn, the lotion doesn't come out. If the lotion doesn't come out, it doesn't moisturize your back. If it doesn't moisturize your back, time, lotion, money and high-hopes for a non-itchy back have all been wasted and dashed to the ground. It also comes with some little cover so you can save the excess lotion in there to use later. What a joke. I went to ""use"" it again the next morning (thought I'd give it a try in hopes that maybe the day before was a fluke) and the lotion was all dried out. What a waste. Oh well, it was a good idea in theory - not so much in real life. Mine went to the trash bin."
1,Roll-A-Lotion Applicator,"Very disappointed with this. It has several balls that allegedly roll the lotion on your back. Well, the lotion works as lubrications for the balls and they don't roll once the lotion is on it. The lotion just cakes up on the applicator. You get more on the applicator than you do on your back."
1,Lotion Applicator,This is the worst product I have ever purchased! Had it two days and it broke! The material it is made of is really cheap because when I went to attach it together it crumbled apart.Don't buy this you will regret it.
3,Good idea needs work,"This is a great idea, but needs beefing up. The plastic cap broke in a few weeks, if you are gentle with the applicator it is fine. Gets those dry spots!"
2,doesn't do the job,"I bought this so I could apply tanning lotion to my back. It doesn't do a very good job. It's uncomfortable, the lotion just sits in the chamber and barely comes out. The pieces don't fit together very securely either. I dont' know if a thinner lotion would work better or not, but who wants to use a thin lotion? I am displeased to say the least."
1,Roll-a-Lotion Applicator,"If I could have given it a ""0"", I would have. Very flimsy. It broke during the 2nd week of only occasional use. The balls do not distribute very much lotion and it took a long time to apply enough to make any difference on my back. Also, if you happen to get the roller balls close to your hair, the hair can get tangled in the balls. A cheap product which does not perform as advertised."
1,Falls Apart,"This item would work well if only the blue part that holds the lotion would stop falling off. It screws into place, but not very well, & falls off very easily & quickly. Maybe I received a faulty one & others work better, but I would still definitely not recommend this to anyone."
3,Good Christmas Present,"I gave this product to my mother for Christmas and she is very happy with it. She says it delivers lotion easily. You have to clean it every time you use it, but she says it's worth it!"
1,Didn't like,"Probably would have been okay, but the several of the little balls kept falling out on first use. Threw this away. Not worth the money to return it."
1,OMG!,Oh my God!! No wonder I see these at the thrift stores! It was so junk! Not worth it! Don't bother buying this!
3,"Works well, poor quality","This is the 3rd Roll-A-Lotion I've owned. The first one lasted quite a while. The 2nd and 3rd not very long. The 2nd and 3rd are visibly less sturdy than the first one and is probably why they don't last as long.I really like the product but I haven't had this one 4 months and the first roller fell out of the unit yesterday. I can put the roller back in but it falls out again the next time I use it.I rated it a 3, the average of a 5 for design and a 1 for quality."
2,not recommended,"Worked OK when I first got it, but after about a month - the rollers don't roll and the lotion will not come out. Dont' waste your money - or put your money toward a different kind."
2,The Roll-a-lotion is a waste of $,"I purchased this product with high hopes of finally having a smooth, soft back. But after a few tries, I find the lotion isn't coming out and some of the balls aren't even rolling!! Am I doing something wrong? I think I will try a different product. Rats!"
2,few years old,"I have had this applicator for a few years...the balls are beginning to fall out...not very effective now...don't know how long it's supposed to last, but mine is no longer useful."
2,Cheaply made,"This product does work well, but it is cheaply made. I have purchased two of these in a 3 month period. I am now looking for another manufacturer of a product like this."
2,Wish it worked better...,"I purchased 2 of these, and soon after, one of them had several of the small rollers falling out; they will go back in, only to fall right back out again. Checked into sending it back, but unfortunately it was just past the 30 day time frame...Also, they can be scratchy and rough when rolling the lotion on. I guess I now have 2 back scratchers, for the dry skin we have on our backs due to needing a lotion applicator! Sounded like such a great idea, I do wish they would have worked better..."
1,Giant Piece O'Crap,"Don't waste your money or time, the balls don't roll, the lotion won't come out of the head. The plastic is brittle and breaks easily."
3,good but does not apply enough lotion,"I bought this product because my boyfriend refuses to put lotion on my back and in the dry mid-west winters my back gets so dry and itchy...my only complaint is, it does not seem to apply enough lotion... but I wonder if the lotion I chose to put in it is too thick? wondering if it should come with a list of lotions that work best in it..."
2,Doesn't hold up under daily use,"I have had three of these, and they last about 3 months before the balls wear enough to fall out, or the handle breaks, or the threads that screw the main parts together wear out and it won't stay together. Good idea, bad engineering, cheap construction. Thanks a lot, China!"
4,"Great, but.","I just received my third roll-a-lotion. I really love it. It keeps my back from being so dry and itchy. That said, here is the but. Both of my first two had breaking problems. Pieces break off of the white part that holds the lotion. I have put a thin strip of duct tape around this new one to see if I can keep it from breaking."
2,lotion applicator,I ordered this because it is the 2nd one that I have had. I enjoyed the first one but started having a problem with the balls falling out. Now it is happening again with the second one. I would like a replacement at no cost or a refund. Thanks Elaine Levine
4,Couldn't live without,"Especially if you live alone this is a great item. How else can you lotion your back, so you no longer have dry skin. It's wonderful. Just don't overload it with lotion or the little balls can't roll."
5,Awesome Product,"I purchased the (Roll on Lotion Applicator) due to having surgery on my shoulder and now disable with my arm...I am totally pleased..It is awesome..I am now able to get lotion on my back, without asking for help..I have had no problems with this product..The price is good for this..And if any thing happens to mine..I will be buying another.."
4,"Gets the job done, but could be sturdier","I ordered this for my mother to lotion her back and she is very pleased with it. She thinks it does a good job evenly applying the lotion. However, the product is a little bit cheaply made, but considering the price, I can't say I'm surprised. If you're careful with not putting too much stress on the handle, it seems to last a little longer. She said she likes it enough that she would keep buying it."
1,Difficult,This just gets really gross very quickly. The balls do not move very well. I would not buy this again.
1,Don't waste your money on this one!,"This thing is horribly made! That really stinks, because with better quality materials, it would be perfect! The plastic is cheap crap and breaks easily, the balls fall out, and the applicator head twists off way to easy spilling lotion everywhere!What do you expect for something made in China!"
5,This is one of the greatest gifts I ever received and I was sure to share the enjoyment!,"I would recommend this for every individual with an itchy back. I tried putting body soap in it and didn't have very good luck, but the lotion works GREAT! Try it - you'll LOVE it!"
2,poor construction,"It really does work, but I've had 2 of them and the handle plastic keeps breaking. It gets stressed when the application ball piece is screwed on and then breaks.I'll be looking for some other kind of applicator."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this as-seen-on-tv this piece of cheap plastic!,I purchased this roll on applicator as a gift for and elderly friend. It lasted about a week. The applicator head did not function as described and got clogged up even with light high quality lotion. Rinsing it with hot(not scalding) tap water cracked the lid because it is so cheaply constructed and the handle was broken by the 6th day of use. My advise: forget it and keep looking!
1,Save yer $$$,"What a piece of CRAP! If the merchant is reading this, how bout my $$ back. Totally worthless P O S! Oh, did I mention ""TOTALLY WORTHLESS P O S! Garbage, totally useless, doesn't work, messy need I go on?I was forced to 'rate' this P O S but sadly, they don't have NEGATIVE STARS"
3,Lotion applyer for backs,I had one before but I wore it out. This one seems scratchy when I apply lotion to my back. Maybe I haven't used it long enough.The other one I had was of better quality but It is better than nothing.
1,missing parts,"Finally opening box after dicarding the generic box that the vendor box was in, found that the applicator for the lotion was there but with no handle. Useless. posted complaint already with no response or satisfaction from Amazon or 3rd party vendor."
1,Not what I was expecting!!,"I was (I thought) buying software that would enhance my ability to do various jobs (newsletters, note cards, labels, letterhead, etc) on my computer. The proventure/brochures software that I received, gives me the direction to ""SELECT PAPER STYLE"", then it gives me NO paper style to select from! It only has one paper style-Brochures ( 3 fold brochure-landscape; 3 fold brochure with rotary; 3 fold brochure with reply & 3 fold portriat). No OTHER selections!"
4,Defending against a knife attack,"This film covers only defending against a knife attack. There is a separate film from the same instructors that is devoted to attacking (Winning a street knife fight).The film covers the basics very well, and in detail. All the techniques they instruct are very simple, and you get the impression that that's all that is needed (I haven't been in a knife fight, so I have no experience myself). The instructors (Marc Mac Young and Richard Dodson) explain very well all the techniques, and they also demonstrate why these techniques are good and effective. There is also much humor in the film, making the film enjoyable to watch.The instruction of the film is very good, but the production is not of the same standard. With better production, this film would be worth 5 stars.Run time: 59 minutesDVD extra: Winning a street knife fight (59 minutes). Also available separately on VHS; see separate review."
5,An enjoyable little pamphlet,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable little book, and the first I read in Kreeft's series. The funny thing I found in this pamphlet is the personalities of the characters are the exact opposite of what I expected. Both fellows I've always suspected were a bit mental. You may remember Socrates standing in the middle of a street for several hours deep in thought. The Socrates in the book would more likely have stepped into a Starbucks, looking less conspicuous. There are some emotional moments where at one point I was in shock. At other times, I would break out in laughter. Because Machi is a funny guy. I look forward to future volumes one of which was mentioned by Socrates. I was thinking it would be great to see Socrates cross-examine Neitzsche, but Kreeft mentioned another philosopher whom Socrates would meet--Kant. I can't wait."
4,"Viking Professional 5 -quart Stand Mixer, Black","I like it a lot, only issue is the top cover that you snap in place when you first unpack it rattles when the mixer is running."
4,Return to Kitchen Klique,Make sure you go see mixer before buying. I ordered the red and it is not color of red i guess i expected it to be. I checked return policy and it states it goes with Viking return policy. I would probably pay a mint to return it plus there is a 20% restocking fee. While not too excited about the red I think I will be happy with performance and that really is the bottom line. I am sure you could put it in cabinet and not have to have it on counter all the time to see. Mixer is not as attractive as Kitchen Aid stand mixer but will probably be more of a workhorse at 800 Watts vs 250 Watts.
2,Poor Kindle edition,"The moment I saw the 'unjustified' text on the Kindle edition, I was disinclined to read it. Could you please make amends to it?"
2,Heavy-handed satire that became drudgery,"This was a middling effort. High class ennui, but the satire is much better in Wodehouse than this book. I love Waugh's writing generally, but his early satire is weak in my estimation."
3,"Nice, but could have been a bit better","It's adorable. Well made. Brightens up a room just be being so neat looking.Unfortunately, the ""many different dances"" are limited to two moves put in a couple of different sequences over different songs. Maybe 4 or 5 songs. Also, the songs are a bit short, so the whole routine is maybe 10 seconds. Tops.But the biggest problem is that there's no reason to buy more than one. If I were the designer, I'd have upped the price point a bit and outfitted them with sensors so that they could sense another Boohbah doll. Then, if you had, say, two dolls, they could sync up dance together. Or three and so on.That's how you get people to part with thirty bucks five times over. Not by putting a different colored wrapping on the same toy."
5,Book on Majohng,This book is an easy and understandable read. It has helped us to know more about this fascinating ancient game and its appeal in America.
4,"Useful, well-written and fun!","A tremendously useful book for those who weren't raised in a proper Victorian household but would like not to embarrass themselves while putting on a proper tea. In particular, the recipe for ""Curry in a Hurry"" was ""yummy""!"
3,A tale of great wealth and possible malfeasance,"True crime aficionados will enjoy reading this book, and it will also appeal to graduates of Stanford University and those interested in turn of the century Honolulu, where the putative murder took place. It's an interesting locale, situated at the juncture of violated native sovereignty and a new, tourism-based economy.The author is dry to the extreme, and again and again nobly resists the opportunity to speculate (i.e., fictionalize) the details of his complex story. He makes it clear whom he suspects, and it's a terrible story indeed. And to think that for a hundred years Jane Stanford has been commonly thought of as dying by accident. Accident--no~-far from it--this was cold blooded murder!A classic case of who-done-it and who covered it up."
4,"Tailfins, hairstyles, big dresses and small ties","This is a cute and not too serious movie from 1961 starring Bob Hope and Lana Turner in a lighthearted romantic comedy. But what I really enjoyed was the clothes, interiors, and hairstyles from the late 1950's. And the cars with giant tailfins! Worth watching for those wonderful styles of a bygone era, which I remember well from my high school years. Bob's little hat. His narrow ties. The big skirts women wore.Lana Turner's hair is so structured, coifed and cemented it's amazing she was able to hold her head up. And the sex stuff - so mild and sweet by today's standards. Cute movie, the America of a more innocent time."
5,Great fun!,"If you're looking for a clean, funny, classic movie, this is it. Bob Hope is great as a writer, hiding out in a California housing tract and helping the women of the neighborhood spice up their marriages, while gathering material for his book on American marriages. With Paula Prentiss, Jim Hutton, Lana Turner and other great actors, you're in for a lot of laughs. Remember, this is a 1961 movie. It's worth seeing for the fashions and what the California hills looked like before they were all filled with houses. Enjoy!"
3,Bob Hope in another great Classic !!!,This is another of Bob Hopes fun films ! Lana Turner plays hard to get in this wonderful movie. Warner states on the case that it is remastered; however it is not up to what I would call remastered though. There is nice color balance; but a lot of dirt and scratches that are normally not in a remaster. There is one scene in the movie with Hope in the kitchen trying to get a garbage disposal freed up when all of a sudden the color changes hue and is somewhat saturated. This is only for a short time period. It was really great to see this movie come out on DVD; but the quality represents that of a VHS version. If you like Bob Hope- you wont be too disappointed. Just wish that Warner Brothers would have taken time to give this movie proper treatment.
5,Brilliant!,"I,ve seen this on the tv countless times, its such a cute funny comedy gem, please please release this on dvd in the U.K., here's hoping."
2,Not as good as his 3 previous salsa albums,"*** stars - can't change the above!Valio is a rearrangement of some of the songs of Amar sin Mentiras. And it definitely has the feeling of an afterthought.While it is a pretty decent salsa album (albeit brief), it is simply not in the class of his other three salsa CD's, Todo a su Tiempo, Contra la Corriente, and especially, Libre. The arrangements are standard competent rather than thorougly innovative and unique as were the older ones."
3,why did you do this to us Marc?,"Now, I am the top MA fan. I have every single cd he has recorded as well as cds that he has cameos in!For one: Lamento boricano is not NEW! He sung this in a cd by Banco Popular (Romance del Cumbanchero) cd years back, and I even have him singing it on VHS. So, that's nothing new.I have the ballads version of this cd, which are pretty and nice. Though, he could have given us a few salsa version of those songs on that cd! Why make us buy another cd! Just strange and cruel marketing if you ask me!I hope Marc decides to not cheat his fans as much, and give us a mix cd of salsa and ballads or just one or the other. I just don't get it!"
3,Kind of fuzzy...,"This is my first flat-screen LCD monitor, so maybe the images and type aren't supposed to be as crystal-clear as my old NEC Multi-Sync CRT monitor. Or maybe it's because everything's enlarged to 19 inches.Also, the Auto-Brightness setting button seems a little limited. The eight choices are either too bright for me or too dark (and that was AFTER following the calibrataing instructions). Makes me miss the old-fashioned manual turning-wheel dial.However, the price was right and it will do."
1,This video is not a work out tape!,"This video is useless if you want to do aerobics. If you want to be a boxer, it might be good for that but it really stinks other wise. It's as if someone shot a boring video in their house about how to punch a boxing bag."
1,snooze mode,"This video was such a let down. I dont think it focused enough on the body as a whole unit. It was mostly upper body. i wanted to see more feet & leg positioning when throwing punches.It wasnt worth its price on...not at all.Sincerely, Disappointed in AK."
3,Precautionary Measures,"I gave this product a neutral 3 star rating because I'm not sure exactly if it works for the intended cause. You must be aware that if you have any sort of ear problem or the ear is already infected, that this product will not help, and does a poor job of adequately warning consumers. I used it and after just a drop or two I was in excruciating pain, so do not use this if there's even a possibility the ear is infected, or if you have a history of ear problems, they will only be heightened."
1,Alcohol,"I definitely just paid over $5 for a couple drops of alcohol. That's all this is: alcohol, 95%. The most expensive alcohol in the world I suspect. I feel dumb."
4,Good for Disinfecting Earbuds,"I listen to my Ipod a lot. I did get an ear infection after using the earbuds, so I bought this product to disinfect the earbuds with. I haven't had an ear infection since."
3,Works but nothing special,"Seems to work, but its just a stronger concentration of isopropyl alcohol (95 percent). I would assume the reason the other reviewer's daughter had a problem was because she already had an ear infection or lesions in the ear."
4,Morbid subject but fun read,"When Bad Blood made its way to my desk I thought that I'd leave it there for a while and then quietly put it on my bookshelf. Luckily, my morbid curiosity took over and I began flipping through it. Before I knew it, I had read the entire book backwards to front. Divided into two major sections-""Case Histories"" and ""Screen Psychos""-the former gives biographical information of serial killers and infamous murderers before providing abbreviated reviews of films that relate, directly or tenuously, to each of them. These ""Case Histories"" stand as the stronger section of Fuchs's book. To have this information collected in such a convenient method is invaluable.Bad Blood sports some odd typos resultant of translation from German to English but they're easy to overlook. The accomplished writing and research elevate the book from what could have been a slapdash recap of movie murderers to an articulate study of an undeniably important facet of cinema. (ISBN: 1840680253)"
5,Great Tau starting army,"This is a great way to start creating a Tau army for warhammer 40k. It has one Tau Crisis XV8 Battlesuit, one Devilfish APC, three Tau XV25 Stealth Suits, one Markerlight Drone, six Gun Drones, twelve Tau Fire Warriors, and twelve Kroot Carnivores. Assembly is definitely required so have glue, and paints at hand. Just keep in mind this is a basic army. It will be torn apart by heavy units so adding more crisis suits, broadsides, a hammer head (or 2), or Vespid squad is highly advised. If you prefer a heavier army with no kroot you might want to look at the Megaforce instead."
4,A great read.,This is a book you can read over and over. It fits itself with what ever situation you are going through. It really makes you think about the importance of relationships and what you are contributing to them. I love it!
2,The scent is distracting,"Much as I like the well-balanced, gentle conditioning properties of VO5 Keep Me Strong, I find the sweet scent of the product annoying. Though the scent dissipates after use, I've decided to try other comb-through conditioning products in hopes of finding one that is effective and appealing in every way."
2,Poorly informed,I also heard Barbara Simpson interview Ms. Firey. from the interview I would have to agree with Frodo's comments below.
3,A Good Beginning point,"This book is an ok overview work of the various types of divination that have been employed by man. Areas touched on include: Astrology, Numerology, Runes, Tasseomancy, Oneiromancy,Haruspicy, Tarot, Chiromancy, Geomancy, Phrenology, Metoposcopy and a few others. The treatment is brief, and should serve strictly as an overview. Don't expect anything in depth in any of these chapters. Well illustrated and nice picture plates. Light reading, nothing heavy. Good for party banter."
3,THE BOOK OF DIVINATION,THIS BOOK IS A WONDERFUL ON THE HISTERY OF DIVIATION!BUT FOR SOMEONE WANTING A MORE SIMLPLIED IT DOES NOT DO THE TRICK.IT IS A GREAT BOOK TO HAVE TOUGHT FOR YOUR LEARNING OF SUCH AS WICCA AND ALL EARTHBASED PERSONS.
4,Sketchers work nicely :),"These sketchers work nicely for work because they feel more like a tennis shoe, but still look more formal than a regular tennis shoe :)"
5,Just what you are looking for,"If you are looking for value, style and comfort look no further. Your feet will thank you."
5,Very Nice,I ordered these for wife along with another Skechers shoe. She was very satisfied and the price was amazing compared to department stores.
3,not bad but....,"I normally wear a 9.5, all 3 pairs of sketcher i have bought thus far a 9's.There is not enough arch support for my day to day walking around but I can comfortably put in an insole. This shoe was bought for work and I walk between 3 to 6 miles in the course of my work day.Always wear either nude stockings or knee highs with this shoe because otherwise the shoe will cause blisters and I generally don't wear any enclosed shoe without some form of socks."
4,Hell Boats,I like it so much that I loan it to my friends. The action in this picture is terrific. I recomend it to everyone to wach it.
2,Picture not representative of shipped product,"While the straps I Received have holes to adjust the length, they are 6 inches apart not 2 inches as the pictures show. I really like the one in the picture and was quite disappointed."
2,You get what you pay for,"I have had a set of these pans for a couple of years. The copper ""cladding"" is actually a very thin plating that can't possibly be of any help in transmitting and evening out the heat. It's purely cosmetic, and it's beginning to wear off completely with each scrubbing I give it. I could accept these as plain, cheap stainless steel ware, except that one of the lid handles broke off under slight stress, while I was drying it with a dishcloth. Sad to see such flimsy stuff - made in Indonesia - from a formerly high-quality brand."
2,poor quality,"I wanted to add to my ""old"" Revere pots that were my grandmothers, so I bought the 1-quart copper clad bottom. They are now CHEAPLY MADE..it's the last time I buy revere ware. Very Disappointed. very poor quality.only reason I gave it 2 stars: shipped quick, good price."
5,Winged,"Have had 2 orther Revere Cooper 1 quart saucepans for 33 years, still great! Needed 2 more with no kids at home. Love there pans. fast service. Thanks"
4,Revere saucepan,We haven't been able to use this pan a great deal. But so far its appearance and durability has been okay.
1,Miniature,Haven't used it yet. I blame myself for my displeasure. I didn't realize how absolutely miniature 1-Quart is. Thing is tiny. Tiny. Simply too small to be practical for anything save boiling two eggs.
3,There is no lid!,"Product description mentions a lid in two places. Says ""Controlled cooking is easy with fitted stainless steel lids."" But this pan comes with no lid."
2,I didn't expect a pot without a lid.,"If the pot is special ( copper bottom ) it has to have at least a lid, but it does not.Revere Copper Clad Bottom 1-Quart Saucepan"
3,Revere makes ok quality pots,"I've had a set of revere pots that I inherited from my parents that is over 40 years old and they are the best longest lasting pots I've ever had, so when I decided to get rid of the other junk pots I had I bought these to expand my collection and they are the same great manufacture as my old pots. Am looking to at least another 40 years with these pots.Update:I've had these pots for about a year now and even though they seem sturdy they do not hold up to high heat as well as the older models. The biggest problem I've had with these pots is how easily they stain. I still think these pots are OK, but I don't think they will hold up very long at all. The copper bottoms seem to be very thin as well. I had a burn through on one of the pots in the first week."
5,Revere Copper Clad Bottom 1-Quart Saucepan,"The same Revere quality. Nice smaller saucepan esp. for cooking for one or two people, or warming up leftovers. Recommend this product!"
5,Excellent pan,"I received this pan almost instantly after placing the order - great service. The pan itself is a perfect size for heating gravies, sauces, etc. Heats up very quickly to boiling point because of the copper bottom. Excellent pan to have in your culinary cooking arsenal! Fantastic price!"
2,Revere ware 1qt saucepan,"I currently have older revere ware and the quality of this recent purchase is inferior compared to my existing cookware. The quality of the stainless is poor(light weight)and the copper bottom is rough not smooth. The thing I dislike the most, is it was not made in USA as all my other cookware. There I believe is the problem."
2,Cheap quality,"This saucepan is OK, but the copper is uneven on the bottom. Also liquids do not heat very fast with this pan because it is uneven on the bottom."
5,Hooray for copper bottoms!,good condition... good quality.... matches all of my wife's Revere ware perfectly....save me from the horrors of burning up a copper bottom!
4,Revereware is still a great buy!,"Although this saucepan is not as heavy as the one I bought in 1955 (and still use), it is still a good buy. I also think I was fortunate to find it. This would be an excellent set for someone just starting out."
2,Revere pan disappointment,"The lid was not included with the pan, should have been clearly stated they were sold separately. Gift for a elderly aunt who had lost hers and wanted very badly to replace it and could not find Revere ware anywhere, sorry but what good is the pan without the lid!"
1,American Psycho,This novel intersperses a monotonous riff on the shallowness of New York brokerage house yuppies with pornographic violence. I got sucked into it by glowing reviews from the literary glitterati. Don't read it. It is tedious and will ultimately leave you feeling like some kind of a sadistic voyeur.
1,What a boring book,"What a boring book. Desciptions are too long, emotionless, as though seen by an outside person and not lived as the writter would like to think she is. It's a book written by a scared and obsessed person who is still afraid to live. She seems to be outerly lost and unprepared for living an everyday life full of adventures, changes, death, unhappiness, impermanece,joy, violence, love,etc...after all these analyses and boring lines she still does not seem to have understood the message!"
3,Poor Quality Production,This book is a fair short treatment of algebra and number theory at the graduate level. I am not writing a review of its pedagogical or mathematical merits. My problem with the book is its sells for about [$$$] bucks for 153 pages but the quality of printing is so poor it makes the book hard to read. The pages are not opaque which means print from other pages appears through. The line spacing is narrow and the inner margins are very small. The hard cover seems to me to be of inferior quality as well.
2,wrong picture,"This cord should be an excellent product but be aware that THE PICTURE IS WRONG!! The plug on the white cord is the same oversize plug (with fuses) like the Christmas tree version. The plug will stick out from the wall more than 2"". I was unable to use it because of that."
2,Stopped working 2 years later,"Worked for two years of 3-5 times daily use. Just a few days ago noticed when I step on it, the fan does not turn on. Bummer. What's scarier? When I jiggled the wires around the foot switch, twisting them, it cut electricity on and off as I twisted and pulled in/out - dangerous!I'm off to buy a new one, different company this time. Hopefully will last longer."
1,Broke after a year or so,I used this to turn off a lamp that was difficult to access in my cramped home. Worked for a while but is too cheap to last.
3,Working fine but switch closer to end you plug into the wall,"Note that the position of the switch is closer to the end that goes into the wall socket than to the end you plug items into. I was expecting it to be more central or closer to the end you plug items into it. I had to rearrange some other plugs to get the switch into a place where I could use it easily, which involved another extension cord."
4,Works great,"I haven't had any problems with it so far. I've had it for about a month, using it every day. The only problem I have is getting it to lie flat. The cord doesn't want to untwist. But it's a minor problem. I thought the nightlight would be annoying, but it really helps you find the thing! I am using it for a floor lamp in a room that doesn't have a convenient wall switch."
1,Wouldn't recommend buying this if you're looking for a heavy duty product,The foot switch broke a week or so after purchase - it blew out. I'd recommend purchasing a surge protect instead or something more heavy duty.
1,Disappointment,"I am looking to understand accupuncture and accupressure without having to suffer through reading text-book style presentations on the subject. Hence my choice of an ""Idiot's Guide"" book -- I thought it would give me, in layman's terms, a greater understanding of the concepts on which accupuncture and accupressure are based -- kind of a mini-course on the subject. Instead, it focused on what practitioners of these medical arts can do for the patient and what to expect when visiting a practitioner.While the book does provide descriptions of points that can be stimulated on one's body to alleviate selected conditions as well as visuals in the form of pictures, these are quite limited and not easy to follow.Also, as I read the book, I was annoyed by the poor editing of the text. Frequent grammatical problems undermine the book's credibility.Hence my disappointment."
5,An outstanding overview with lots of practical information,"This book is just what it should be - a good overview, an excellent survey, with useful information. Information you wouldn't likely see in any one book.If you're looking for a single book to help you get started - this is a good one for such a purpose.The depth of material is reasonable, considering that it covers so much and is an overview/survey."
1,"No Illustrations, huh?","Tell me, if a book is written for idiots, wouldn't you expect some pictures andillustrations of the subject matter? The subject is acupuncture, so where are the illustrations of the pressure points? This book is very disappointing for this key reason."
2,Mistitled book,"The title should state ""Complete Idiot's Guide to Acupressure"" because there's very little puncture data. Not worth the price in my opinion. I learned from it but not what I was hoping."
2,not too helpful,"This is for the individuals who know absolutely nothing about acupunture. Good introduction, but a complete waste, if you are trained or are a physician. There are better and more technical books. It really depends on your current level of acupunture knowledge."
2,Not as Good as the first one!,"I found the first book extremely helpful for creating Library displays and bulletin boards, however this book was a great disappointment. There were not nearly as many good ideas, rendering this book a waste of money. Thank goodness I had only checked it out at the library."
5,An amazing AV receiver,"After my son fried my old and faithful Yamaha receiver, I scouted around and decided after a lot of research on the Marantz. I'd heard a lot of good things about this brand, and I am happy to report that they are all true. I wanted this receiver primarily for listening to music (so I'm old-fashioned, I listen to SACDs, not just mp3s)and secondarily for my home theatre. The only negative which I can possibly come up with for this receiver is the lack of true HDMI connectivity - which I think is a small compromise for the quality of sound and the build-quality. A great buy, if you can pick it up for what I paid - the list price is ~1200K, and I got it for under 400. Additionally, the sound transmission through my powerlines to the separate receiver works seamlessly."
5,Terrifically helpful,"Thank goodness for this book. It is exactly what I was looking for. Dr. Greene's theory and practice is very helpful. This book outlines his ""Plan B"" very well, and if you are a parent looking to help your child and get some peace in you life this will help you."
4,Great Film,"If you are a fan of films like Kill Kill Faster Pussycat, Natural Born Killers and any 50's fun sci fi film...this film may be something you will thank god you discovered. A very fun film, everyone will have fun with it. Recommend."
2,Another Dang Disappointment,"In the last few dang months, I've pondered if I should just stop watching modern horror films altogether. After watching El Monstro Del Mar, I've thinking that might be a dang good idea. Well, at least until Scream 5 comes out. Or Friday the 13th, Part 69. El Monstro Del Mar, like many in recent years, is a dang horror film that looked fun on paper. But after viewing it, I only found about ten dang minutes that were fun. The gore is about the only good thing in this cheapie that wants to be as dang good as those old Roger Corman movies, but it just can't pull it off. There ain't even any dang nudity in this film. How can you make a modern day horror movie that's set on the dang beach, and there not be any dang nudity? Even Jaws had some dang nudity, and it was rated PG! The bottom line is that I wouldn't want to sit through El Monstro Del Mar again, for all the dang hemorrhoid cream in the world."
3,"a classic to the ages, but very hard to play","I love the originlity of this game, based on how old it is. The game is very creative and I love the music....Here's the bad part, it's very easy to lose in the game, even on easy mode!you have to time your steps perfectly or else your going to run out of food or fuel. The first thing you have to do in the game is go to sleep, and sleeping in the game is as hard as s*** because your more likely to lose sleep when aleep...the hardest part of the game is probably not dying, because you constantly need to eat and go to sleep after all the damage the guitar warriors do to your life fource. And once again, your running out of life and fuel every moment in the game, so it's really important that you dont f*** up.I swear, the day I beat the game is the day pigs fly..."
3,"Jekyll, Hyde, and plenty of sex","I collect different versions of the old story of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and I expected this one to be a bit daring. In fact, it was more than so... The book is actually rather well-written, but the sexual content would be more exciting if it didn't happen so very often, and for no appearent reason, between anybody and everybody who just happens to be in the same room toghether! More story and less sex and this would have been a rather good version of Jekyll & Hyde."
5,what a fantastic novel,"Although the reviews below are full of praise, none of them suggest what a truly gripping, enjoyable read this is...I tried Sleep With Me just because it's had a rave review from Jonathan Coe, another great British author, and how right he was. It's one of the most addictively absorbing, thrilling, sexy, witty novels I've read for years, with an amazing sense of place, great characters...I was up until 3 a.m. reading it, and am recommending it to EVERYONE. A must-read."
4,Early classic concertos,"It's just such a pleasure to hear concertos that I have never heard before, and which are rarely performed. The recordings are very good and are an excellent addition to my library."
3,could of been better,"i bought this book hoping for lots of pictures and descriptions of the woodys built in the past 100 years. it does cover the making of woodys and several models of woodys. the problem is it seems as though the writer couldnt find enough stock examples so he included customs, woody toys, and several pages of manufacturing. too many customs, too many woody toys, and too many pages of manufacturing for what i was looking for. worth buying but only at a discount."
2,PNY NVIDIA GEFORCEFX 5200 128MB,had a lot of problems with video lockup playing 99% of newer games. PNY's fixes have not helped. Tech support is a joke. They run you through a lot of choices before you end up at a dead end. I am going to try to get my money back rather than an exchange cause I DON'T want another problem card.
5,Great,Product exactly as described and arrived much faster than expected. Would most certainly order this product again if needed. Great
5,One hell of a scary prop...,"As an live-action vampire gamer, I can say that not only is this posibly the greatest WW book there is, it also makes a great prop. Having the book 'written' by a malkav, and 'published' by another is a great touch that makes the book of Nod easily accessable to any occult character (or malkavian). A touch of genius, and certainly my favourite of all game books."
5,Beautiful legends and artwork,"Being a Toreador myself, I was initially turned unto the beautiful artwork....but the stories were equally as beautiful and fascinating. Although I was a tad dissapointed as to what the original Toreador had to say about my clan....oh well. As well as being fun to read, it is also a good supliment to the Vampire game."
2,Not as horrific as I would have hoped,"I am not saying that this book is not about vampires. I am saying that it is more or less just a gloved attempt to educate people about the story of Adam and Eve and more stories from Genesis with a twist of vampire just to gloss it over and make it edgy.Some decent artwork and if your a fan of the series, then by all means indulge. For those who love their vampires more like The Lost Boys and less like Twilight stay away. This seems like an old lady took a stool on the genre and called it vampire. I love the bloodthirsty bloodsuckers not the diary keeping emo kids. All you goth kids would love this maybe. I wouldn't know, I don't cut myself. Sorry if your offended, but this is coming from a fan of Blade. I just am not a sexually frustrated and confused teenager who listens to The Cure . I am a mid twenties horror action slasher fan. If this sounds like you, STAY AWAY!!!! ITS GARLIC!!!!!!"
4,FEARFULLY REAL,"THIS IS NOT JUST SOME OL' FOLK LORE, I AM SORRY TO SAY. BEING THE GOD FEARING MAN THAT I AM, KEEPING JESUS CHRIST FIRST IN MY LIFE IN ALL THAT I DO, I CANT RATE THIS ITEM. THIS BOOK IS MEANT FOR A SELECT FEW, IF THAT. JESUS IS THE TRUTH. DONT READ THIS BOOK UNLESS GOD CALLS UPON YOU TO DO SOGOD BLESS AND MAY JESUS BLESS YOU ALL"
5,"Highly Recommended, if you are into The Masquarade","A great little, inexpensive book that can provide a wealth of ideas for storytellers. Power Players will already own it, and use the knowledge frequently to control the game...if they are allowed to. The book's binding alone is worth the price. The competitive advantage the content provides is priceless...(And this Ventrue got his money's worth...)"
1,"Cannot Rate This Item, it was broken","I gave this 1 star because it would not let me do otherwise...I cannot rate this item because the box had been opened prior to my receiving it. Someone had tried to put it together but tried to put the big end into the small end. It stripped the threads.I was really surprised that this item was sold again after the damage. I returned it and got a full refund. Please, please do not sell damaged goods to loyal customers. You will lose them quickly that way."
1,Junk,The threads on one side of the bar are all messed up and I can't screw the rubber part in. Very poor quality control on such a simple item. Unusable. No excuse for this sloppiness. Not worth shipping back so I get to eat the cost on this purchase.
2,Lukewarm,"This coffee maker looks very good and the controls are easy to use. However, the coffee came out lukewarm even though I warmed the carafe with hot water before running the coffee maker. The other concern was noise, with it being quite loud, perhaps contributing to the illusion it would be coffee worthy of loud praise, but alas, my response was as lukewarm as the liquid that came through. I returned the machine for a refund right away."
1,Very disappointed,"The coffee pot keeps shutting off automaticly and not even filling up half way, tried many many times, cleaned it and ran just water first and that didn't work either."
4,not THAT bad!,"I purchased mine for $70 at Tuesday Morning. Came home and read reviews that weren't not favorable of this maker. I almost took it back but decided to keep it.Some of the troubles people had were easy to either fix or be knowledgable about just by reading reviews. Not hot enough? Well, I guess that depends on how hot you like it. For me it's fine. I don't like super hot coffee. I want to drink it right away, not wait 5-10 mins.Ease of use; there is not an indicator/cup fill line on the outside. It is located on the inside on the water uptake tube. Don't fill higher than it says. Make sure lid is completely snapped down. Make sure carafe is properly inserted. That's it. I think it works fine.Also, the clock directions are not on page 10 as stated, but rather on page 12. Instructions are a bit lacking!"
2,Automatically Shuts Off Before All Water is Dispensed,"I loved this when I first bought it because the carafe keeps the coffee hot without it sitting on a burner, turning into tar. After I had it for several months, it would shut off before all of the water had run through the system, so I'd have to stay nearby and turn it back on, until all of the water was through the machine. The coffee tastes fine but I can't trust it or have it set to turn on, because after a few minutes, it shuts off and doesn't finish making all of the coffee until I push the start button again and again until all of the water is extracted. It forces me to stand there for 15 minutes or so until it has run its course. UGH"
2,Loved the design. Hate the hassle,"Sorry to say that I am returning this product. The manufacturer's consumer line told me to use the carafe with the lid on to pour water into the reservoir. It takes FOREVER as the water trickles out just like any coffee carafe. If you try pouring water into the reservoir from the carafe without the lid on, it just spills everywhere. I was then told to use a spring water bottle or a separate cup to fill the reservoir with water. This is just not practical and the lines inside the reservoir that tell you how much water you are measuring are very difficult to see. It's like you would need a flashlight to see how much you were pouring in. There are no water indication lines inside the carafe. All in all, even though I thought the machine looked cool, it's just poorly designed and not very well thought out for the consumer. Saeco needs to go back to the drawing board."
3,Coffee snobs,"We like strong coffee and notice things like the difference between a fresh brewed cup of coffee and one a half an hour old. The carafe works well for keeping the flavor better longer. My critique with this machine is it has no way to slow down the brew speed to make a stronger brew if you want it. The first time I used it it was like- ""you're done already?"". I have had to use more coffee than I want to in order to strengthen the pot to my taste. If I do that its okay. All in all better than the last three makers I've had in all other facets. I'd buy one if it was on sale."
1,The worst coffee maker EVER.,"We had a Krups Aroma Control for almost 8 years and absolutely loved it. However, the white exterior was stained so we decided to replace it with the Saeco Renaissance. The first one we purchased overflowed constantly -- which isn't the best way to start the day. We exchanged it for another one, hoping that the problem was a fluke with the first machine, but after 2 weeks the second machine overflowed all the time as well. Save yourself the hassle and don't even consider this coffee maker. We're trying the Zojirushi next -- and I'll review it after a few months. Cheers!"
2,look elsewhere,"I returned this product after using it for 2 months. Unless you're okay using a separate measuring cup to add your water each morning and you remember to insert your filter, this will not be your cup of coffee.The one time I forgot to insert the filter cup, the coffee spilled all over the counter and even into the machine. This caused the machine to stop working altogether. Not a user friendly maker."
5,A great read !,"I really enjoyed this book and didn't want to put it down once I started it. It was so great to read that these children made it without mental scaring for life. I am sure they have some, but just that Othello was able to share her story had to be healing. A few of the pages are hard to take and makes your heart break for the life they had to live. It makes one wonder how that place was able to get away with so much cruel punishment. But then again I know how they got away with it, the $$$."
2,Too traumatic for too long to be true,"My title tells it all . Where was a the older brother all this time? Where we're the aunt's, and the grandparents? Just too many holes in the story...I truly enjoy non_fiction, but this seems overly exaggerated."
5,A brave and raw journey that offers hope to those who suffer,"This book is a courageous, brave, and powerful retelling of the authors life. Not only does it retell the trauma and it's affects on the author but does what so little autobiographies manage to accomplish, which is to navigate the individuals way out of that chaous and suffering. As someone who has experienced a great deal of trauma I feel it offers hope and an alternative in which to help cope. It is a trully powerful and inspiring book that stays with you long after you're done reading."
4,A should read,A very good read.I started this book and didn't want to put it down.such a good writer.I would definitely recommend this book.
5,Cry into the wind,Makes you appreciate the life you have. Love unconditionally. Fear not. And learn to love and be loved. Anyone who has ever experienced any form of abuse would benefit from this life story.
3,A walk on the bad side of religious schools,"I had heard of how some religious orphanages were run, but this first-hand account of someone who experienced it and the side affects of a motherless family just tears at the heart. The father was shameless. A good read."
5,Must read,This book was a pageBy far best book I've read in past 6 months . I read at least 3 books a week .
5,Cry into the Wind,"I loved this book! This is a very heart touching story. There is something about true stories that takes me back to my childhood times, good times and bad."
5,Cry into the WInd,Very readable. Might read it again someday! In spite of many problems she had enough determination to use her many talents to overcome them and succeed!
5,Cry into the Wind,Great story of triumph over adversity. Othello beautifully illustrates her very unbeautiful childhood and the love between siblings. Eye opening views into church orphanages in the 1940-50's.
4,A good book,"This book was well written about a girl's life growing up, as well as her siblings. The hardships they dealt with. At times it was sad. I can't imagine what her and her siblings life was like living in an orphanage. I liked that she made something of her life, like she wanted to despite what she endured."
4,Cry into the wind,"Ok, so I initially chose this book because based on the cover and title I thought might be about the Dust bowl...guess we should never judge a book by the cover. This was a riveting and emotionally powerful book. It is hard to believe that anyone could live through that kind of abuse and neglect. Great book that I would recommend...just be warned of the adult nature of the content."
5,Loungin' in the 70ties,The england based Mother Earth offer the listener a psychadelic journey into the past. Retro sounds (with retro clothes on the cover). Listen to the lirics and imagine yourself sitting on a superb green field of grass. Behind you a line of trees and the rest of the forrest. Looking out over the ocean below the steep cliffs. The sky is blue and everything is fine! Very clear and relaxing music. A must to people who like to go back to the time of love and peace once and a while.
4,"A Funny, Good, Movie","This was a funny movie. At sometimes it was a little confusing but good! I think kids who like to laugh or act would really like this movie. It has kids who are horrible actors, that make you laugh loudly. This is a Great Movie!"
3,A sweet-natured comedy,"This is a likeable (if somewhat naive) comedy with perfectly cast stars in familiar situations. This is by no means a movie for someone looking for strong depth and unpredictability, but it is quite funny and sometimes touching."
3,Ok,"There are a lot of activities but most are not that original. And most only take a few minutes to complete. I was loooking more for activities that take up approx. 45 minutes, not 10 minutes."
5,"104 Games ready to use for Teachers, Therapist & Leaders","This is a GREAT book for Sp.Ed.Teachers,Teachers, Counselors,Church group leaders and families. Children, teens and adults can all learn more about themselves while having a good time. This book works on Self-Esteem, Coping Skills, Communication, Anger Management, Self-Discovery and Teamwork. Each game is prepared with Objectives, Audience, Group size, Materials, Description, Discussion prompts and Variations for 104 EXCITING GAMES.

4,Fun and therapeutic!!,"This book contains excellent, easy and fun, not to mention therapeutic, ideas. Most activities, however are geared toward older children, of reading age and thus can not be used with younger children. I have used many of these activities with great response from the children who have so much fun they don't realize they are growing and discovering a lot about themselves."
4,Games for all kinds of reasons,"This games in this book are great for introductory activities, building a positive and socially interactive classroom environment, binding a group ""community"", easing into collaborative or cooperative learning activities, and engaging ways to take a break from more serious classroom pursuits."
5,A mental health professional must!!!,"If you are in the mental health field, this book is a must. I have utilized many of these activities which have all been a success. Teaching elementary and junior high students social skills can be a challenge, but not with this book in your library. The activities are targeted towards children who struggle with self esteem issues, anger management, and coping skills. This book is FANTASTIC!!!"
3,Not as Good as her other Book...,"This book is pretty good, but not as good as her Teamwork book. The key is that this book does not have team building activities like the other book. It only covers what is stated. I would still recommend this book for the topics it says it covers... but dont buy this for teambuilding..."
3,Beware the duplication from her other book!,"I got this book becuase I liked JOnes' other book Team-building activities for Every Group. I was so disapointe to find a dozen or more of the activities exact duplicates of ones from the other book. Word-for-word. Other activiites in this book are good, just didnt like the covert deception that i was getting 104 activities when i already had purchased some of the once!"
2,"Too simple, too vague","I found that the activities in this book are too simple, and not flexible enough to adapt to the wide range of teens in my line of work."
1,rip off,"I ordered a cable from this company and did not get what I ordered, when I tried to inform them I received emails that were not nice.I would be very careful."
5,Pleased to find this CD.,"A wonderful collection of the roles sung by this superb and multi-talentedbaritone of days long gone. In 65 years as an opera lover, I never heard abetter Figaro or a more bone-chilling Scarpia."
1,Can't use 2nd USB port on Powerbooks,"This device has serious design problems when used with a powerbook G4. Since the powerbook's USB ports are next to each other and this Iogear device is so round at the sides, you cannot use your other USB port. This means you will either need to purchase a USB dongle or sacrifice the port. Also, I was not able to get the device to work on Mac os X. The system would not recognize it."
1,It is defective,"I bought this adapter 4 months ago. It took me almost an hour to pair it with my SE T68i, and I was naively suspecting that it was because of the phone. I was using it rarely, so I could afford 30 min struggle of establishing the connection. But recently I got a 3Com adapter from a friend, and it worked flawlessly. In fact you just need to pair the devices for the first time, and you can reconnect any time after that. I called tech support and told them my story, they said that I have a defective unit. I got a replacement unit, and apparently this one is defective too, because I can not pair it with my other devices AT ALL. Stay away from this adapter, apparently all units are defective."
1,j&K cameras sent me a broken camera,"We spend $768 to buy this camera. However, when we first receive it. The camera box was not sealed. we were thinking the camera should be a new one, and continue to use it. End up the port upload to the computer didnot work, and the Company selling this camera (J&K)refused to provide any repair or help because it passed 7 days after the purchase. We are very disappointed with this seller."
2,Great video!! Absolutely horrible sound!!,"No doubt about it, the Canon HV20 has a great picture. The ability to shoot in HDV and 24p is amazing considering the cost of this camera (right around $1000). Unfortunately, nobody mentioned the subpar sound. The microphone picks up the noise from the motor and tape. I'm sure I could find a way to take out the hiss/whirr sounds in post production, but good grief, nobody wants that headache. I haven't seen it mentioned here on Amazon, but many other boards/forms have many other users who have experienced the same problem. The only solution I have seen is to buy an external microphone ($150-$500), but that still doesn't eliminate the noise from this camera. If there is a fix for this, let me know as I would rather keep the camera than give it back."
5,amazing and clear image,"this is my second camcorder and i am very glad with it, the image is amazing, if you watch in a high definition tv, the diference is high.I recommend use mini dv HD, you will see the diference"
4,Great Camcorder,"Great camera. Very easy to use and seems to fit your hand pretty well. Optical zoom is x10.... I wish it was more. I have a macintosh computer and had no problem installing the canon software. Uploading the video to the computer was easy with the fire wire. Overall, I think the camera was a great buy and am very satisfied."
4,"Compact HD camera, best HD value.","This is a great camera. The video output is incredible; guaranteed to put the output of your VHSC, Hi8 or older cameras to shame. The tapes are kind of expensive, but the quality is worth it.I haven't tested the firewire output yet, but everything I've read elsewhere leads me to believe that this will work great with my Mac.I've owned many Canon cameras over the years, and I am never disappointed."
5,"A bit out of date, but still a decent camcorder.","A bit out of date, but still a decent camcorder. It shoots fine, I have a 35mm DOP adapter on it, with some Canon EF lenses on it, plus a mattebox. It's really fun to shoot with."
5,Vibrant Colors and Super Sharp Image,I am very pleased with my new HV20. It exceeds my expectation for color saturation (since it does not have 3CCD's) and the sharpness and detail when shown on my 1080i HDTV is nothing short of excellent for an amateur outfit.One gripe is the sloppy fit of the battery. I fell in love with HDTV when I watched my first programs and now I'm feeling sorry for everyone still filming home videos with SD camcorders. You should get one - $900 is cheap for what you get (assuming you care about the film and subjects you shoot).
2,Can't connect to PC,"Picture is beautifull, but cannot connect to my PC via Firewire port, Windows looks for a AV/C Subunit software nowhere to be found, Canon tech support unable to help. Looked on various forums in the internet and this seems to be a common problem, with no solution so far.Nobody seems to know what is AV/C Subunit"
2,My HV20 failed after 4 months,"I bought this camcorder four months ago. I was really happy with the image quality of my recordings. However, last week I needed to use the camera (after not having used it for about three weeks) and tried to turn it on only to find out that it wouldn't. Thinking the battery had run out, I left it to charge overnight. The next day and for a couple of days afterwards I tried a combination of things to try and get the camera to power-up, but nothing worked. Finally, I gave up and called Canon tech support. Tech support told me that I had to send the camera in for repair. I sent the camera in for repair paying $42 out of my own pocket to do so. Hopefully, it will be repaired and come back soon. Another person wrote of a similar problem with this model and I'm beginning to wonder if this model might be prone to such problems."
1,Beware: motor noise ruins your sound recordings,"After 2 years with my HV20, I'm splurging on a new SDHC flash drive camera, because of all the HV20 motor noise, which ruins my video sound recordings. I love Canon & my HD video camcorder, and I bought all accessories from Day 1 including the DM-100 directional microphone. But it doesn't help the motor noise problem. It may even be worse with the DM-100, I can't quite tell. If anyone has ideas to solve, please post."
2,HV20 Lens Shutter Breaks,"I have had the camcorder for a couple of years with fairly light use, maybe 20-30 hours total on the camcorder and the motorized lens shutter broke. I can's see why Canon would make a lens cover motorized given that most other camera types, such as digital SLR's have manual lens covers. It's an unnecessary design risk for an absolutely critical function: open to let the image come through. I won't buy another camera with an automatic lens opener and prefer an manual lens cover. STAY AWAY from this model."
5,:),This mixed Japanese chilli spice is pretty good. It is very hot though! A little goes a long way. I like it.
1,Yuck!!!!,"I love Pepperidge Farm Milano Cookies and I like almost every one of the different Milano flavors but I just don't like these raspberry milanos. The raspberry taste is very strong and very yucky! They taste fake too with a strong imitation raspberry flavor! Yuck! I recommend The Milk Chocolate Milanos, the chocolate Orange Milanos and the Mint Chocolate Milanos instead!"
1,Kat's dipstick oil heater,"I used this dipstick heater in a Subaru Outback for the first time this past Saturday. The overnight temp was ten below. The black rubber of the electrical cord on the heater solidified and cracked completely. I had to apply electrical tape to prevent shorting. It was extremely difficult to get the long element into the dipstick tube. The second time I attempted to insert it into the tube, the element buckled like an accordion despite my being very careful. It is now in the trash. A complete waste of money."
2,So-So Product,"Unit was shipped with a bent tip rendering it useless to fit any oil dipstick tube. I re-shaped it, plugged it in and it worked but wouldn't recommend buying."
1,junk,"does not work a piece of junk total waste of money would not recommend . it doesn,t heat up enough to do anything"
1,It doesnt really work unless...,"I got this thinking it would warm up my car or keep it warm it doesnt work, waste of money, dont buy it"
2,Failed,"One use, and gone. Warmer car up, as instructed, inserted in block (dipstick), seems to work the one evening, but never again...."
1,Failed after one week,"Do Not Buy!!!!The unit failed after one week of operation just like the other reviewers mentioned. It's a shame, it worked well at first and I thought it was really going to be useful. The unit was never abused and was only run while it was sitting in the crankcase. It's just a piece of junk."
4,"Great, but MAKE SURE it will work with your car / truck!","These used to work great when I was a child. I think the size of the dipstick sheath / receptacle has changed over the years. I had to essentially force the dipstick heater down into the oil chamber. This caused it to curve / bend and I'm still not sure it was down far enough into the oil.Consequently, I think I burned it out. But I can tell it would have worked just fine, if there'd been a better fit. So again, MAKE SURE it will work with your vehicle and if you have to force it or you don't think it's going down into the oil far enough, clean it off and return it before you damage it!"
1,dip stick,"What can I say, it burned out the first time I used it. save yur money and go for a better item that will last."
1,2 PRONG - Ungrounded unit...shorts out!!,"Description says ""Three prong grounded plug"". This is not accurate. It is a 2-prong ungrounded unit that shorts out when submerged in the pre-heated oil. I debated purchasing this item due to the negative reviews. I am a retired industrial maintenance tech and yes I followed the directions. Since they were calling for blizzard conditions I thought it would be worth the risk. I installed it in my (warmed up) tractor and plugged the unit in. The following day after the storm subsided, I went out to see if it was working. It was ice cold and I could see by the discoloration that it had indeed heated up and shorted out. I ordered a replacement and I am hoping that I will get the proper 3-PRONG grounded unit.Just an update: Amazon sent me a replacement. It also was another ungrounded heater. However, they changed the description of the unit to a 2 prong, ungrounded heater. I returned the unit to Amazon. Once again, great customer service."
1,worked once,after reading the reviews i bought this with some hesitation. i had the same affect as the other two guys. i pluged it in one night when the oil was warm and it didnt keep the engine warm but it kept the oil warm resulting in better oil flow for the first couple minutes of start up. the next night i went to use it again with the oil hot and the next morning when i pulled it out and touched it it was ice cold (0 degrees out). i tried it two more nights since then and it does not work anymore. next time ill buy one that goes in the lower radiator hose
1,completely worthless,I had used a a dipstick heater for a few years. I don't remember what brand it was but it did a satisfactory job. I misplaced it so I ordered a Kat's dipstick heater expecting similar results. I inserted the new heater into the crankcase and plugged it in. I came back a few hours later to check on it and it had burned out. Don't waste your money on this.
1,NO STARS!!,"Tried one unit which worked for about an hour: smoked from the top, heated up, went back to check it and it was dead! Unplugged it from the outlet and retried, but to no avail. Got a replacement from Amazon and second unit performed same as the first. These are junk! Surprisingly, the Kat's battery warmer is flawless, but this thing is a sham."
4,dipstick oil heater,"it was what i expected,i like it because it is easy to use,i would recamend it to freinds and family."
4,The Set-Up,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
5,SUPERB FILM NOIR FROM ROBERT WISE IS A GREAT DVD!,"Long before television's ""24"", Robert Wise gave us this 1949 film-noir classic, set in ""real-time"" against a boxing milieu.An exceptional performance from Robert Ryan, with great support from a seasoned troupe of film favorites, THE SET-UP will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.The DVD looks marvelous, the best I have ever seen of this film. It captures the essence of the RKO-noir look, and is genuinely film-like. Don't be swayed by these neophytes who negate a video transfer because it has ""age-related artifacts"". What hooey! Not every film has to undergo a million dollar digitization to look as good as it did when it was new, and THE SET-UP has surely never looked better!An added treat are insightful commentary thoughts from the film's director Mr. Wise, and another legendary director who seems to like the movie. Some guy named Marty Scorsese. :)Grab it!"
2,Was this Author supposedly SPECFOR?,"If he was, it must have been for the country of ""Bologna)Very often former soldiers try to relate their experiences while embellishing their exploits, any former SPECFOR Soldier will quickly see this sad attempt at self glorification for exactly what it is, trash"
3,So-so,"This was a cute comdey film, but the length of time it took to ship was not appealing. The movie itself was comic, but not knee-slapping hilarious. Over all it was an okay buy, but with shipping and handling, maybe a little pricy"
2,too thick.,"Item is very sturdy, and I gave it two stars because it might do well for some other purpose (I have yet to find one), but it is too thick and doesn't allow the cupboard to close. I would not recommend this item."
1,Awful,"I am very unhappy with the under shelf basket that I ordered. It is way to long for my top cabinets (which are standard size) and on the bottom, it is very hard to get to. The basket also is not very stable, it moves around when you put anything in it or take anything out. Overall, I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Very Poorly Made,I was torn between these racks and the type that you mount on a door or wall and eventually settled on these which was a TERRIBLE mistake. When we received them they were twisted and the arms on one of them weren't even the same height resulting in a wobbly mess when we put them on the shelves in our pantry. The wire they are made of is thin and cheap and the product in general is very poorly made. I will definitely be returning both of them.
1,Arrived Broken... low quality.,"This product arrived broken, but I gave it a try anyways. I really wanted it to work, but the metal is too weak to hold the weight of a package of ziplock bags, a roll of tinfoil, a roll of plastic wrap and a roll of parchment. I am very disappointed. Don't waste your money on this one, folks."
4,Funtional Extra Space,"I ordered it for the kitchen, but ended up preferring to use it in the bathroom. It works for that little extra shelf space you need. It blends in so well you can hardly tell it's there."
5,UnderShelf Wrap Rack,"We are so glad we bought this item, it keeps some of our pantry items up and out of the way! It really is a space saver and is a good value for the product."
2,Does not fit standard top cabinets - MEASURE YOUR CABINET FIRST,"This came, seems sturdy, but it is too deep for my top cabinets. I asked and was told my cabinets are stadard size, but this rack is deeper than the cabinets. Disappointed since I really wanted this to organize my foil and plastics. If you have deeper cabinets this would be nice to use."
2,Does not fit all cabinet sizes,"I was surprised to see that this was too long to fit my cabinets. I do live in a small apartment. I probably should have checked the dimensions, but I assumed it would fit all sizes. Learn from my mistake, measure first.I imagine if it had fit, it would have worked. Seems sturdy."
2,Great idea on paper but doesn't work when put to the test,Make sure you measure your cabinet. Most standard sized cabinets above the counter will not fit it unless you use a wire cutter. It will fit in under the counter cabinets but you can't put stuff that is too heavy because metal will bend. It looks great in the picture but really isn't practical to use.
2,Meh,"Not as nice as I thought it would be. Also, seemed kinda cheaply made. It's not what I needed or had been led to believe it was like."
3,Did not match.,I ordered two. I got one that the rack was squared off and the other was rounded so they did not match. I was disapointed but did not return. They are not going to be seen by a lot of people so it does not matter. Other than that they work fine.
3,good product...but pricey...,amazing product... but make sure your shelf is long enough to hold this inside... good fit for long shelves. but little pricy.
3,Great if you have the shelf space,"I had high expectations for this rack. If my shelves were long (deep?) enough, they would've been great. It didn't fit in my cabinet so I had to return. You also have to make sure that whatever you're storing below the rack is short enough to not interfere with the shelf and the boxes."
2,Not true to the dimensions given,This was much larger than the picture and product write up indicated it would be. I could not use it for the purpose intended. We'll see if I can find another use for it somewhere else in the house.
3,Under shelf rack...,Just okay...a little less stable than I expected...but it does do the job. I probably would not have bought it had I seen it in a store.
5,well made item,"The photo doesn't show it but this rack has a back to it and is shaped like a rectangular basket. It is the right size for a box of plastic wrap or the basic size of aluminum foil, but a roll of butcher paper or the longer heavy duty foil is going to be too long for it. That said, it is deep enough that those items don't fall out. The arms are nice and sturdy and slide snugly onto the shelf. It fits perfectly on the top shelf of my pantry closet. I use it like in the photo, for storing food wraps and storage bags."
2,Too big,This is much too big for our cabinets and we have a large kitchen. It was too deep for most of the cabinets and to tall the cabinets that would fit it.
3,not what i expected,"I can not used where I wanted but it is being used for other thinks after all now i made a boboo, I have to used to what ever porpuse i can put it to work"
5,super long,"I didn't realized this item was so deep, even though I saw the picture showing the boxes of aluminum foil and plastic wrap box fitting perfectly fine in this shelf. So it doesn't fit in my cupboard at all. But since I am planning to move in about a month or two, I dont care about this mishup and will keep it, since it looks SUPER sturdy! love the use of it."
1,Too Big,"It is too bad I cannot close my cabinet when the rack is installed. The edges are too thick, which gets on the way of the cabinet door. :-(Under Shelf Wrap Rack in WHITE model 1983W from Organize It All"
1,"Flimsy, unusable","I excitedly ordered this after seeing a mention of it on an organizing website. When I got it and put it up, I was extremely disappointed because the top part (with the hooks) was so flimsy. I bent it to fit the shelf we have, and then put one--yes, one--roll of foil in the basket. The back part of the basket leaned down and the roll fell out. I was going to put about five or six rolls in that basket...obviously not.Definitely not worth the purchase for even $.01."
3,"ok product, bad fit","Product is OK but because of the way it's designed the bottom in the front leans forward enough that if you shelf isn't set back at least 1/4"" the cabinet door won't shut all the way. Will work great for a pantry shelf where you don't have a door closing against it."
2,Don't be fooled by the picture - you won't get one like it,"The pictured rack looks quite sturdy, and holds four rolls of wrap without sagging away from the shelf. The rack I received was made of flimsy wire, and it drooped significantly when I put a roll of aluminum foil in the rack to test it out. The whole point of the rack is to keep the wrap above items on the shelf below it - this fails that test. It's not worth the hassle to return, but I may have to use it to hold light weight items, and not the wrap it's supposedly designed to contain."
1,larryn,does not fit in the space of the wall mounted cabinets this shelf is to long to hang correctly and cutting it down will not work either
1,Miserable little shelf,"This is a miserable little shelf.Poorly made, cheap materials.Doesn't work properly. Lilts to the back.Had to prop it up with soup cans."
2,Great for saving space poor quality,I only put 4 containers of foil and plastic wrap and the back bent down. I had to prop it up with soup cans. Definitely doesn't work like shown in the picture.
4,A little flimsy,Was a bit more flimsy than I expected. Bounces around a lot when putting things into it. It does serve the purpose however!
3,Disappionted,"I got this item but it doesn't stay under shelf like in the pic, mine leans down in the back. I'll try and get a hook to hold it up in back."
2,It really doesn't hold weight,I just have 2 aluminum foil rolls and it doesn't hold it well... I think the holders are not strong enough..
3,MEASURE! Wish I'd listened to the other reviews...,"This product fulfills it's purpose but seems to be larger than most standard pantries/shelves. A little duct tape did the trick, but I wish I'd measured before I ordered as other reviews had posted."
4,Under Shelf Wrap Rack in WHITE model 1983W from Organize It All,"Under Shelf Wrap Rack in WHITE model 1983W from Organize It AllNot the sellers fault, but did not fit shelf, door stays open due to frame hitting on door. Keep in mind you have to have shelves that go far back. I like the idea of this product, but would prefer my door to close. :)"
2,Flimsy,"I kept it because it was not worth the money to return it but it is rather flimsy. The back end flops down when the wrap containers are placed inside. I could duct tape the back part to the underside of the cabinet, but I'm not going to bother. When this falls apart I'll just trash it."
1,too wide for top cupboards,"The item arrived a bit slowly but it is too long to fit into the overhead cupboards, it will only fit into the lower level cupboards which is not convenient for accessing it. It is the length of a roll of saran wrap so it wouldnt work if it was shorter, so either way, just not a good product."
1,I think it stinks...,"This thing just didn't work well with any of my shelves. Without a screw mount on the top to drill down into the shelf the unit kind of stinks. It sags a ton at the bag if you load it up as pictured and really is a pain in the butt for the shelf below. Becuase of the cost of the product and my laziness I think I just jammed it down in my basement. However, I should have never purchased in the first place. Just trim down the junk in your drawer and get better rated and reviewed organization products."
2,Flimsy,I liked the idea of the product. But I will buy something that has better quality. This one is so flimsy and just one roll an it hangs.
1,got damaged item,As many of them mentioned you need to measure your shelf before ordering this. This did not fit my cabinets so for me its useless and got damage piece. :(((((((((((((
2,Busted Crap,Ok the price wasn't bad but both racks we ordered arrived squished and broken. I'm sorry but metal products shouldn't break from shipping. The metal bends easier than a coat hanger. These products were shipped with others from Get Organized and none of it had any sort of protective packaging. The other products were also junk. DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!
2,"two different versions - one good, one garbage","I ordered one of these. It was well made. The back was open so that longer items could stick out the back instead of the front. It was made of sturdy round wire including the arms that set on top of the shelf it hangs from. I liked it so well I ordered another one.The second one has a closed in back and the arms that set on top of the shelf are flat. The arms on the second one are weak and if you place anything heavier than boxes of tin foil or sandwich bags on it the back of the rack will sag down, due to the weak arms sagging.The one with the round wire arms and open back is great. The one with the flat arms and enclosed back is cheap junk. If you order this, you are gambling on which version you will receive."
1,cheaply made and no back...,"Not the strongest made piece. But an even bigger problem is that there isn't a vertical piece in the back to stop the foil or wax paper from falling out the back. I may throw this out and get another. Also, wobbles when you put something in or take something out."
1,Flimsy metal,Very flimsy metal that bends easily and was not able to hold up 1 freezer bag package and 1 sandwich bag package. I'll be returning this poorly made shelf rack.
1,Not sturdy,we ended up not using this because it wasn't sturdy enough. we threw it away. The wire that holds it on the shelf is way too weak so with weight it bends
2,Flimsy!,"I bought two of these and they are super flimsy! I don't know how they are holding the weight of the wraps in the photo, unless they are just empty boxes. Mine bend with just a few things in them."
2,Not that great,I had to put this in several different cabinets until I found one it would work in; the shelf depth has to be a little shallower than that of the cabinet or the door will not shut. I ended up putting this in my garage for my husband to use. :-(
3,Flimsy,"This rack looks great in the picture but once you fill it with foils etc., it hangs down from the weight. Overall I like having it as it does save space."
3,Good idea,"I thought this was a great idea, especially for small spaces. Unfortunately I did not measure the depth of my cabinet and the product is longer than my cabinet."
5,AWESOME PRODUCT,I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT IF YOUR NEEDING MORE SPACE. WE HAVE A SON AND WE NEEDED TO MAKE SPACE BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL AND I GOT SOME OF THESE AND IT MADE SO MUCH SPACE.
4,It's good if you have the room for it,I really liked the idea and the rack is much bigger than I expected. My problem was that I did not measure the depth of my shelves in the pantry and the shelves were too short on the underside because of how the shelves were mounted. I ended up using them in the bathroom closets where the shelving was deep enough and the height between shelves was high enough. Make sure you measure both sides of your shelves and the height.
1,Not satisfied - does not fit,"Product shown in picture as nicely fitting inside cabinet. However, shelf length is longer than std. cabinet depth. Had to scrap since it was useless. Also, bracket holding cabinet divider fits loose."
1,"1983W is FLIMSY, CHEAPLY MADE, JUNK!!!","First, there is no way the product pictured is the same one sent. The picture shows the rack neatly level with the shelf. The product I received SAGs to an alarming degree. So much so that you would have to put something under the back to prop it up, or you would have to tack it to the underside of your shelf.Second, the positive reviews have to be either shill reviews, or for similar products. The garbage I purchased is ""Under Shelf Wrap Rack in WHITE model 1983W from Organize It All."" It isn't sturdy, and as mentioned above, without support, you aren't getting anything under the rack, so it isn't saving any space.I bought a competing 'Rubbermaid' branded product at my local WalMart that is just fine, so it's not the concept, it's the second rate material used here.Save your money!"
1,Under Shelf Wrap Rack,It came in 2 pieces so it is hard for me to write a review. I didn't get to use the item. I was very disappointed because I really wanted the item.
5,I love this!!! Definitely recommending this to everyone,"Update:Just bought 5 more, and they were delivered timely as usual. I am super happy! Now I have to get smaller ones for my small cabinets ;)I bought it not really expecting to find it useful, but I love it! After filling it with container lids I figure I need more to fit everything else that's awkward in the cabinets! I'm super excited to finally be able to have clutter-free cabinets. I should be a spokesperson ;)Some things it's great for:ziplocs and trash bagscontainer lidspot lidssponges and wipeswashcloths...and more, but I'm too lazy to write them all."
2,Poor design and quality,"Please be aware that the far end of the shelf bends down, even without load. The hooks are too weak. Returned for that reason."
2,It works but has some wiggle,"It works. I use it for boxes of jello and pudding mixes under a shelf in out pantry closet. The distance between the arms and the rack is not adjustable. Despite the good width of our shelves, it wiggles. For this reason I would not use it inside the kitchen cabinets."
2,Good Quality but of Limited Utility,"Just too small to really help organize. Quality is OK, but not very helpful in keeping things in order. Functions as avertized. I wouldn't buy this product again because it just wasn't as effective as I wanted it to be."
1,Came broken,"So cheaply made, came broken and I didn't even bother to return it. I wouldn't waste your time and money."
5,Might have been my favorite Christmas present...,"I've been wanting this for awhile, but didn't want to actually buy it. So I left it on my wishlist and it got passed up time and again. Every time I saw it still sitting on there, I'd quietly whine about it. My boyfriend finally took the hint and got it for my for Christmas.I HATE the pantry. I hate that everything is always toppling over and in the back and you just can't find a thing. I love organization, and no matter what my pantry was a mess.This has helped me in the steps towards happiness. It fit perfectly and slides right onto a shelf. It's so much nicer to be able to grab the tinfoil without getting a flashlight first! I like it so much, I might buy another! Just measure first to make sure it will fit."
3,Good but one drawback,I like the size and easy way to organize with it. The drawback is the back of the shelf rack does not hook to cabinet shelf. I used white duct tape to secure it to the white cabinet at work. Had it been any other color (cabinets) I would have sent it back.
3,Too deep,This item was too deep for any of my cabinets. Probably my fault that I should have measured first but I don't recall there being different size options when I was ordering. The shelf itself is heavy and sturdy - just measure the depth of your cabinets first.
4,Shameful sound quality,"It's a real shame the sound quality isn't better on some of the recordings. The Pierne concerto, for example, is performed wonderfully by Marylene Dosse, but the sound quality is horrendous. It sounds like it's being performed inside of a pillowcase. For the sake of anyone else purchasing this CD, let's hope mine it just defective. I can always get another one for free from my teacher (Marylene Dosse)."
1,Terrible toner. Ripoff!,"It says Xerox but it's not, its from some other country. Sent it back, haven't gotten credit yet & it's been over 3 weeks, Will be emailing them."
5,Triphala is good stuff,"Take it on an empty stomach just before bed or before an evening practice. Mix a teaspoon with about 2 or 3 oz of normal temperature water and some honey.It will not dissolve completly but enough. It taste really bitter, so this way is more palatable than trying to make it into a full cup of tea.If you have eaten recently, then use sugar instead of honey.It helps in its effectiveness to taste the bitterness, instead of using capsules. When you taste it feel yourself strong, and that will help its effectiveness as well, rather than shirking back from it.Triphala consists of three herbs, Amla which is famous as a rejuvinative and very rich in vitamin c, bibitaki, and haritaki which has been called the king of the himalayan herbs. It helps the eyes, heart, hair, and intestines, gives stength, and tends to push out toxins accumulated in the body. It helps for sound sleep as well.Do not take too much, and with that said it is safe and like a food for the body."
2,Disappointing,"As a true follower of French design & architecture, I was disappointed. First, I am not found of ""coffee table"" books in paperback -- immediately it cheapens the experience. Second, I found there little guidance of substance on creating the ""French touch"". The photos and homes did not meet my expectations."
2,Not a good design,"this cane/seat is meant to help those who have difficulty walking and standing for a long period. the cane is not very helpful for walking and the seat, which must be straddled is impossible to use for someone who is unsteady on her feet. I was unable to balance to get my leg over the seat."
4,Folding seat/cane,"Handy and sufficiently well built to hold advertised weight. However, if you're looking for something you can pack in a suitcase for occasional need, this won't do. I'm not even sure such exists but it would be handy if it does and if it could be made strong enough."
1,Paid for next day air - it was shipped 7 days later!,I refused this shipment. I paid for next day air and they shipped it a week later - TOO LATE!!!! I refused delivery and am still waiting for a credit to my account.
1,The pic deceived me,I did not know I'd have to straddle the handle...most people who need a cane can't manage to do thatAnd returning it cost me $13+.
3,Folding Cane Sling/Seat,"Only used when I plan to walk a few blocks and back when resting is required. This Cane/Seat Looked more strudy than 'Tri-Pod' Cane Seats I have seen. I'm pleased with this 'Folding Cane Slind/Seat' ,though I don't use it every day."
4,Next Best Superstar Remixes,"This is Melanie C. first release on her new label and I really love the song ""Next best superstar"". The album version is great it is more rock flavored, but it still should be loved by her Spice Girl fans. Next would be the song ""everything must change"" which is a very great song in it's own right and I wish she would have included some remixes of that song as well. The remixes fall a little short for me except the ""culprit alt. mix""which really jams it adds just the right amount of pump to the song and it would be great if they used that mix for radio."
4,Phenomenal bargain,"Aaron Rosand is one of the most overlooked fiddlers of our day. His Sibelius is fresh, with Rosand capturing a musical snapshot of the dark, cool Finnish landscape. The Lalo is stylish and impeccably executed. The remainder of the discs, while well played, does not quite reach the excellence of exalted interpretations by Heifetz in the Havanaise and Rondo Capriccioso, or Oistrakh in the Poeme. Occassionally there is some strain in Rosand's slender tone, some of which may be attributable to the sonic limitations of the recording. Climaxes in the Chausson and Berlioz and hindered by such technological limitations. But beneath such problems is exciting and vibrant playing well worth the unusually affordable price."
4,Pretty damn good,"Luck help find this CD's way into my hands and ears, and boy am I grateful. Very mellow, ""groovy"". Lots of acoustic strumming and smooth, easy vocals from Matt Deighton. A very delightful surprise."
5,"Now, this is baseball!","Casting, detail to to the emotions and charm of the game, and the very heart of the minor league-the people that make the game.The kind of movie you don't mind seeing over and over. This movie depicts one player's love for the game, a coaches dedication to game and the abilities of his players, and also the reality of what the minor leagues were all about.I guess what impressed me the most what the script. The dialogue was appropriate, as was the content. A family movie."
1,Cannot understand,"I am a beginner for 3D graphic. I choose this product becasue I used poser well and I would like make a model for me. It is a new area for me. However, it looks like too difficult to use and it cost lot money."
2,Not Appealing,Many of the gardens in this book are not really that small by urban standards. Most of the photos have a dated quality about them and there is very little written content for each of the spaces. Would not recommend this book.
2,philosophy?,a woefully overdirective book that gives children a pre-set choice of answers rather than inspires them to come up with their own creative and reasoned responses. Would that the author had more respect for children's capacity to engage in autonomous thinking.
5,troubling,"Consider the definition of ""existentialism"" as given by the author: ""a movement that emphasized the practical aspects of existence."" Well, Sartre and others were hardly pragmatists! The author could certainly have done a better job introducing the essence of Sartre's ideas to kids - they'd probably find it appealing. In any case it is much too open of a book for kids. However, I am giving the book 5 stars because I commend the author on his efforts and he has probably done good by a lot of kids who are interested in this topic."
3,Philosophy for Kids,"Wasn't really what I was expecting. I was looking for a little more information on the philosophers and their ideas as opposed ideas for discussion in philosophy. If that's what you want, though, this is a good book for you."
3,Too open ended for kids,"I bought this book to read with my nine-year old daughter. Lots of great questions posed, but we found they weren't explored deeply enough for our satisfaction. One could argue that this is precisely the purpose of the book, ie to encourage further discussion, but we're both quite new to the field of philosophy and lack the training and tools for a deep evaluation of the issues. Another book, Philosophy Rocks (Law), offers far deeper analyses (of admittedly fewer questions), but left us far more satisfied and inspired."
4,Ready for the Sequel,"I really enjoyed this book, although the ending left me a bit surprised (and not in a good way). The story seemed to turn into a soap opera plotline right at the end. Up until then everything was believable. The book is still a good read and the characters come alive in your mind. It was hard to put down. I guess I need to see where the story goes from here."
3,Stepfather Review,"This movie was very good, although I'm sure that the first Stepfather is the best. I remember seeing the first Stepfather years ago when I was younger but can not find it now. I have looked everywhere. Some sequals are good but the original is always the best. The Stepfather II is better than the Stepfather III..."
3,First movie was a hard act to follow,"...but at least Terry O'Quinn stuck around for this one. Jerry Blake's latest fiancee in this film is played by Meg Foster, an actress who has always given me the creeps for some reason. I was actually rooting for Jerry Blake to kill her.FOR SOME STRANGE REASON this sequel is on DVD and the original is not. Go figure. Are the ownership or distribution rights to the first one in dispute or something?The first one RULES! Great psychological horror and a career-defining performance by O'Quinn. And director Joseph Ruben would go on to make some other great films, including ""Return To Paradise"" with Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn.As for ""Stepfather 3""... ignore it except for the fact that O'Quinn's replacement is Robert Wightman who actually does a very very good job replicating O'Quinn's mannerisms, body language, facial expressions, speech patterns, voice, etc. It is more imitation than acting, maybe, but he's very good at it."
4,DON'T UPSET DADDY!,"I know that I am amongst the minority here, but I actually enjoyed this as much, if not more, than the first Stepfather movie. Although it is less suspenseful, it compensates by offering more in the way of horror. I think it is a complintary sequel to the Stepfather and together they make a great set. Terry O'Quinn gives a great performance as the deranged pshyco who is in search of the ""perfect"" family, and although the supporting casts' performance isn't quite as impressive its not completely awful either. Horror and thriller/suspense fans will both enjoy this movie. Adopt it now!"
4,The best of three,"Terry O'Quinn rocks as the Stepfather. This was a big improvement from the first volume with lots of subtle humor and scary moments; although, Meg Foster's eyes were probably the scariest part, lol. The commentary sucks, as most commentaries do. The deleted scenes should be deleted. For a B movie, this one is pretty good. Terry O'Quinn is underrated.Skip the third movie because O'Quinn is not in it, and the plot sucks."
2,INFERIOR IN EVERY WAY TO THE ORIGINAL!,"I've always enjoyed the 80's horror film known as The Stepfather, it had wit, charm and suspense with a couple of splashes of blood and gore. This sequel seems to lose sight of what made the first film so likable and aside from O'Quinn giving a decent performance this film offers little else. It's a watered down version of the first film with no where near the wit, charm, suspense or gore, so why bother? Unless you want to see Stepfather III....Oh brother! ;-b"
3,Not as good as the original; just okay,"Again, it is O'Quinn who shines the brightest as the stepfather, who managed to survive long enough to break out of a facility and go out into the world again, seeking a new identity and a new family to take over. It seems to take an awfully long time to do this, however, which makes the movie a bit of a slog and not nearly as suspenseful as the original.There is a great, funny/creepy scene in the wedding chapel which I will not spoil."
3,The Stepfather 2,"Following in the immediate footsteps of the first film, THE STEPFATHER 2 finds Jerry (now Gene) cozying up with a real estate agent and her son after his bloody escape from the institution. Things appear to be going well until her estranged husband returns to reconcile and her closest friend begins growing suspicious of her new fiance. The sequel does offer a familiar plot, but with weaker characters, writing, and suspense, it ends up feeling more like a cheap imitation than a true continuation story. TerryO'Quinn remains to be the only ingredient in the film that works, although his performance feels much less inspired than before. Sequelitis has also set in, as the blood and gore have been noticeably increased in order to capture some of the late 80s Slasher audience. While it may not be as enjoyable as the original, THE STEPFATHER 2 maintains a similar style and tone that should appeal to series fans.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
3,A viewer,"A pretty good horror flick, it may not be as scary as the first one, but it is a well made sequal. Some parts of the movie are pretty creepy and the acting is great.All in all STEPFATHER 2 is a spine tingeling horror flick that is great to watch on a Friday or Saturday night, so you should check it out."
4,Terry Sells Film Once Again,"Another stellar performance from O'Quinn as well as a clever script overshadows a rather inferior supporting cast compared to the first film. It might not have the same appeal as the first film, but it was a treat to hear the stepfather whistle again. I recomend it to anybody who's a fan of The Stepfather and Terry O'Quinn."
4,Not what I thought it would be.,"I do like this author's style, but despite finishing the book I felt it might have been handled differently, the subject matter. He does have keen insights into human nature, but not all of us can relate to them."
2,Sophomore Jinx,"A major disappointment after The Mezzanine. Baker goes to the well once too often by trying to recreate that excellent book here. That first book seemed to avoid crossing over into pretentiousness by giving us a self-deprecating narrator and by simply pouring on the wit and intelligent observations and forcing you to laugh. Here, pretentiousness and self-indulgence abound. The subject matter is just far too personal to connect with the reader and, simply, it seems that Nick didn't try as hard the second time around. If you enjoyed the pretentious and turgid essay ""Lumber,"" then this might be for you, but if you were drawn to this book after reading more engaging Baker fare such as U and I, The Mezzanine or Vox, stay away."
4,The Schwa Was Here,"Nicely done, well written, the story of a boy who was, for all purposes, invisible (until he decided to take charge of his life). I thought the ""crime noir"" style of the narrative was a little overdone, but i enjoyed it nevertheless. Many kids and adults will identify themselves, sadly or guiltily, with the characters."
3,"You'll like ""The Schwa""","Anthony ""Antsy"" Bonano struggles with the pressures of adolescence, argumentative parents, peer friendships, and beginning to understanding girls. The plot centers around Antsy's relationship with Calvin Schwa, a boy who is also struggling but in a more fundamental way with discovering his own identity. ""The Schwa"" has an interesting but also handicapping ability and Shusterman uses poignant humor to tell an enjoyable story about these engaging friends.The only disappointment is that Shusterman does revert to the overused plot convention of the absent mother. In this story thankfully however, there is also the positively portrayed character of Anthony's mother. Enjoy!"
5,The Schwa Was Here,Great book for middle school students to read. It is a book that all adolescence can relate to in one way or another.Very entertaining also!
3,boring.,"I origionally picked up this book because we had just learned about a schwa in english class. A schwa is a upsidedown e, that is invisable when put into words. well i expected the book to be about a invisable kid. he was invisable alright. but the book was so boring. there was no hook. i had to read this book for a report and it just dragged on. there was little story to go with, none of which was intresting might i add. the ending was alright, however i dont see how this book won any type of award."
3,Not a complete outfit,We are disappointed because we were expecting to receive a complete outfit like the photo shows but only the white parts were included what a horrible price for something so small!!
1,Dry as toast,I don't know how someone this interesting can make a documentary this dull.And 3 dvd's! I bought this to show my students and can find very few elements that won't send them to sleep.This material is found in much better outlets elsewhere.I'll never use this.
4,Best Selleck Drama,"I always like Tom Selleck movies. Some are actually very entertaining. This is by far his best dramatic role. I was very impressed how well he played the part of a framed Airline crew chief Jimmie Rainwood. F. Murray Abraham gives a great performance as one of the prison inmates, Virgil Cane, that befriends him. It has all the elements for some good drama, bad cops, drugs, decent and really bad convicts, attractive loving wife, and motive for revenge.David Rasche and Richard Young do a fine job as the crooked detectives that frame him. I have recommended this to many people since many Selleck fans are not even aware of it. Whether you like Selleck or not you will enjoy this film if you like movies like ""The Fugitive"",""US Marshals"", and ""Shawshank Redemption"". It is being released on DVD soon and you can bet I pre-ordered a copy."
4,Very Good Wrongly Accused/Prison Movie,"Corrupt cops, high on cocaine make a bust at the wrong house. They frame an innocent man to cover up their mistakes and Tom Selleck is sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit and is taught prison ways and how to hang tough by life convict F. Murray Abraham. His wife continues to try to prove his innocence, assisted by an IA officer who senses there is a problem with the arresting officers. Great performances and the most interesting performance for me was David Rasche as one of the bad cops. When this movie was made he had just finished a television series called Sledge Hammer, a comedy spoof of Dirty Harry movies in which he played a tough cop. His performance is almost the same in this movie yet there's no comedy and he translates that Sledge Hammer performance into a scary, intense character."
1,The Innocent Man,Without my knowledge this video is only viewable in the UK. This was mailed from US address to a US address. So it seems strange I wasn't informed that it wasn't for our region.
5,Gave as gift,"I have not seen this one yet, but I love all his movies.I will have to borrow it back to see it."
5,Excellent Movie,As with all Tom Selleck movies it was well acted and a pleasure to watch! I thoroughly enjoyed the time I invested in watching this movie!
5,TOM SELLECK - WHAT A GORGEOUS MAN!,"This is a great movie - I saw it years ago and I loved, loved, loved it! Tom Selleck is an exceptional actor!"
5,An Inocent Man,My brother had been looking for this movie for a long time and wasn't able to find it. I found in on Amazon and ordered it and had it sent to him. He was thrilled. The movie was in excelent condition and was delivered to him in fast time. He was one happy person and I was a happy customer! It is an excelent movie. And the price was very reasonable! THANK YOU!
1,An Inocent man,I purchase this movie about a month ago and I did not receive it. I want to know what happened with it. I'm still waiting for my movie. Thank you!
1,Never received the Item,I usually have an awesome time with your product but in this purchase i received zilch.... Usually you are on time and very punctual... At first i thought it might have been because of the Holidays... but time came and went and I never received the item...Like I said before i love the service i get from Amazon but sometimes like in everywhere you would receive one person who may have failed you or something going wrong..... Thanks
4,Two inept cops who frame An Innocent Man,"This is the story about two inept cops who frame AN INNOCENT MAN named Jimmie Rainwood(Tom Selleck). The two plain clothes police officers deviously plant drugs inside Jimmie's home,also using his mailing address. The cops spot a shadow of what looks like a pistol,but is actually a hair dryer. Jimmie was drying his hair after taking a shower. After other officers discover the drugs in Jimmie's home,he is arrested,arraigned,convicted and sent to prison for six years. After Jimmie is released,he and a few friends scheme to incarcerate the drug-planting cops. The cops end up in jail. Jimmie's buddy(F. Murray Abraham),who's still in prison,says at the end of the film,""Ain't life a motherf---er?"". This film was not as great as THREE MEN AND A BABY and HER ALIBI,but I loved it."
5,I love tom sellecl,"an old movie that I have always loved, especially because is was written bya former classmate.great quality, prompt shipment - thank you amazon.."
5,Another Tom Selleck homerun- hits all the needed parts,"Tom Selleck has always been a favorite of mine and I own many of his videos and ALL of his Jesse Stone series. This is almost a cereal western (cop) type film. It hit all the required ""buttons"". We have the innocent man wrongly convicted, his dedicated wife's struggle to save him, true love totally dedicated to each other, the good cop and the bad cops, the facilitator (helper), the prison bad guys and the struggle that was inevitable, the fight scenes and the happy ending. I have added another Tom Selleck to my connection and have watched it 3 times in the last couple of months. Buy it, don't just rent it."
4,An Innocent Man,Am a big fan of Selleck's Jesse Stone series so recently bought this just because of Tom Selleck & very much enjoyed this movie
2,a bit scattered,I thought the book was not well organized and also a bit dated.Carla Fine's book is better.
4,A fair live album.,"If you're looking for new material, don't buy this one. One new song is featured, but most are from recent albums. If you're an old fan, this probably won't impress you very much. The production is pretty fair. It's better than I thought it would be. For a great live Mortification album, check out Live Planetarium. Few come close. All in all 10 Years Live, Not Dead is good. Unless you collect Mort merch, you can pass.El Kabong gives it four head-bangs!"
4,"Works great, but needs a little tweaking","I just got home from a trip from Kansas to south Texas with this on the roof of my 2007 Ford Focus, with a roof carrier attached to it. It worked great!I recommend buying a set of ratchet or lashing straps. The clips that come with the rack, though they're made of metal, don't really give the feeling of strength. The straps connected to the clips are very thin. Also, I had to zip-tie the lashing straps I used with the rack to the rack itself, to prevent whistling while at speed.My other problem with the rack was the holes in the rack, for connecting the bars. If they are left uncovered, those whistle, too. I grabbed a roll of duct tape on the road, and covered these up. This solved the problem, but I would have liked to not have had to have taken that step.Other than the above-mentioned issues, I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing a way to transport extra cargo with their vehicle, no matter the distance!"
3,Decent racks for the price. Not a great mounting system.,"The attached clips did not fit well on my door jambs (2005 Mitsubishi Lancer Evo) so I had to use the straps on my hand holds. This worked ok except that the driver's side doesn't have a hand hold so I had to use the clip and I wish it was more secure. So, I used some para-cord to tie down the base bars in case the mounting system gave way (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S5ODNC/ref=oss_product) and that worked well.After installing the para-cord, I drove these base bars with a snowboard rack for 100+ miles at 100+ mph without any issues. I also wrapped the para cord around the front 2 bars about 10 times to cut down wind noise and it worked great.Overall, these racks will work but I definitely recommend securing them with a backup system in case the base clips fail. I'll likely upgrade to a car specific base system in the future."
3,fair review,I bought this product and tried to install it on my honda civic.But I could not get the tiedown straps to tighten up.As it was a good price for the price but coundnt get the straps to tighten up so I returned the item.
2,highland universal car top bar carrier,"the product is ok. however, the arrived package was broken with heavily wrapped tape. the bars were not inside the plastic wrap. all indicates it was a returned product from the retailer who did not bother to repack it."
5,Well made considering the price.,"Bar is painted (powder coated) medium gauge conduit. Seems heavy enough. I cut it shorter to fit my Corolla better, removing all overhang. The Suppport pillars are plastic, but of pretty heavy grade. I think the tie down straps are too wimpy, so I replaced them some heavier ones. The strap hooks seem fine, and did an excellent job fastening to my 1990 Corolla. I welded up some brackets for carrying skis, then drilled and bolted this to the cross bar. Very spiffy. Considering that this carrier is 1/10 the price of the name brands, I am very pleased."
1,Honda Pilot owners: don't buy,"I was under the impression I had to have these for my 2005 Honda Pilot, which does not have crossbars, to use with the Highland soft-sided car top carrier. These bars are supposed to attach to your car using straps and clips, but the clips did not attach anywhere. Even after jury-rigging the straps, the bars still moved around and did not seem very secure. Was glad I purchased the Surelok Tiedown straps. I attached the car carrier straps to the crossbars anyway for a 6-hour trip, and everything worked fine (probably due to the extra tie-downs). But on the trip home, I did not attach the car carrier to the crossbars (attached side-to-side instead), and nothing budged. So if you have an older Pilot, I don't think you need these crossbars for the ""Highland 10391 Kar Pak Rainproof Soft-Sided Car Top Carrier."""
2,Incomplere Parts,Recieved the shipment but it was missing some of the hardware. I would give the return process 5 stars they refunded my money back into my bank account within 3 days of recieving the returned item.
1,Bad quality parts. Poor design. An absolute fraud and rip off.,"We installed the rack and checked it at every stop. 600 miles down the road, all seemed fine then the front straps let go. I had checked the straps just a few miles back when I bought gas. My car is now dented and the paint is badly scratched in several places.I am utterly disgusted with this product. Amazon should not sell this inferior product. It is a sham."
1,Not Universal,"While the bars fit across my Taurus, the metal grips that were supposed to sit inside the car door were to shallow to use. It would not even fit past my rubber window sealing. They should tell you the grips are only 1/2 inch deep. Very disappointing."
1,Not really universal,"I purchased this product specifically because it said it was universal and could be used on cars, trucks, and SUVs. I used it for the first time yesterday on my 2010 Chevy Traverse and the clip that grasps the edge of the vehicle doorway let go when I went over a bump and my kayak went flying. I had pulled and yanked to be sure that it seemed like it would hold and it seemed like it was going to be OK. It was fine on the trip to the lake. I double checked when returning home but it didn't make it. Not happy. Not impressed. Still needing to figure out what to do about it."
2,Not good for the long haul!,"This seemed like a good inexpensive way to haul my kayaks on top of my GMC crew cab. Bad idea! It might be OK for a very short trip but is far to unstable for any distance. The carrier is probably fine for something rather light and with a low profile but for anything that will catch the wind I wouldn't recommend it. Also, the nylon straps really ""sing"" in the wind."
4,Inexpensive Good buy,I bought this to carry my kayak on my 2005 chrysler 300 it works great and very sturdy. The instillation was simple and it carry's my malibu stealth 12 perfectly. A good buy!!!
3,You get what you pay for.,"It was cheap to buy and cheaply made. I already had a piece break. The clips do not fit my VW well and only hold because you can close the door on them to secure them. When you open the door the fall down and hang. However, it does do the job of carrying surfboards and paddleboards securely."
1,never again,flew off the top of my car on first use - lost > $1200 of ski & snowbaord equipment. would not buy again.
3,Product Very Flimsy,"See my reviews for the Keeper 7200 Roof Top Cargo Bag. These bars were not necessary using the Cargo Bag, Skid-Pad and the Cargo Hooks."
1,Cheap garbage!,"One of clamps broke and the bar blew off the car going down the highway on my first trip with them, before I ever had a load on them."
1,Universal car top bar carrier,This item does not fit all cars to may it hold. The clips sliped out and the carrier flapped and broke the back window of the car. and it was propertly put on right. Rate it as minus stars
1,Not as strong as they seem,"I traveled about 400 miles each way with this roof rack, and I was highly disappointed. on the first trip the rubber feet somehow blew away. and on the second trip, our luggage flipped off the roof along with the racks! (highway driving) . No warning whatsoever. If you're going to use these racks, I would suggest using a ratchet strap for your bag as reinforcement ."
1,Caused Damage to Car,"Purchased this prior to vacation because I wanted to be able to transport a rented surf board from the beach to the hotel and back. First decided to use it to transport 2 beach chairs and 2 beach umbrellas down to SC from CT. I attached everything securely as instructed. Everything looked good, felt tight and appropriate. Still not sure exactly what happened, but once I reached 60 mph on the highway (approximately 5 miles into our trip), the whole thing gave way and flew off the car causing huge dents and scratches on my car. Thank goodness no one was behing me or it would have caused an accident. Looking at about $800 worth of body repairs on the car. NOT HAPPY!"
4,good for the cost,"for the cost, I surely wouldnt complain. These worked out fine for me. I did renforce them with some ratcheting straps to hold down my luggage."
5,Glad I bought it!,"Bought this for my 2005 accord. IT's a little noisy, but we were able to install it quickly and easily. It worked great for the roof top box we borrowed. We drove from VT to VA and back again. Popped it off and stored it when we got home. Excellent buy!"
3,roof rack,"ok, i bought this rack to carry a canoe on my subaru sedan. it worked pretty good i took the canoe for a six hour drive and back with out a problem. i should have listened to the other reviews because some how i lost one of the rubber feet on the ride and nearly lost another. i wouldnt plan on leaving the rack on when not in use, it whistles and hums and the rain water seeps in thought the straps. all in all it is more than i expected for the money."
1,Get it if you want to lose all of your belongings on a highway!!,"We carefully read the instructions and installed the roof rack. We were using it to hold one large suitcase and a folding double stroller. Everything was strapped down and secure. About 20 minutes from home the rack flew off the car, along with all of our stuff. We were on a major highway in California. The fact that no one was seriously injured is a miracle. Our load was lighter for the remainder of our trip as we no longer had anything to haul!Seriously, this was a nightmare. Think we'll need to pay up for something better next time."
1,useless for me,"The price was too good to be true for a car top carrier. Not badly made, just a very poor design for my 04 honda civic. Would not use on a trip of more than 1 or 2 miles. It would likely fly off the top of the car."
2,You get what you pay for.,"This product is a cheap solution if you're looking for a temporary removable roof rack. Otherwise, if you're looking for something a bit more permanent, move on from this one. I gave it two stars because one, it arrives quickly, and two, its what it says it is, otherwise, save your money,"
3,"Bars are OK, Included Straps are Junk","I used these for a 500 mile round trip (mostly highways and interstates) with a softsided cargo bag. The bars are fine, but the included straps did not work for my Chevy HHR. I ended up using 12' lashing straps to hold these down and that worked fine. Wind noise was greatly increased, but since nothing fell off my roof I can live with it."
2,Box arrived busted & parts missing,"I recieved this via a freight forwarder who noted the package was open/taped, however the four feet that raise the bar off the roof are missing from the box rendering the product useless. How do I file a claim with Amazon for this? I've never experienced this problem with Amazon before."
3,"Inexpensive, OK for short distances","I wanted this mainly for securing plywood sheets and other long home improvement items. It is very easy to attach and detach; and seemed to stay in one place pretty well. There are four hooks that sit between the door and the car frame attached with nylon straps. If you are not going very long distances, I think this is a good buy, but for particulary long trips I would want something attached more permanently.As far as the universal fit: it fits well on my 1997 Sentra, but I could not put it on my 2007 Mazda3 [maybe you can, but I couldn't figure out a safe place for the clips to engage].It does make a bit of a whistling noise, but because it is easy to install and remove, this isn't much of an issue."
1,You get what you pay for with this product,"I just received this roof rack set(lightning fast shipment and secure packaging from Amazon) and I am not pleased with it. Specifically;* The supports are plastic, they should mention this in the description, I assumed that the bar supports would be metal.* The gripping feet that come in contact with the car roof are smooth and slippery so even when the straps are as tight as I can pull them and the assembly will not move side to side, they still slip on the roof front to back.* The lip holding the foot onto the plastic support is also rather flimsy.''All in all it's cheap made in China crap, you definitely get what you pay for. I am going to try to find some rubber gripping material to use under the feet to stop them from sliding around."
1,Bad Product,This was a horrible product. Used it once and the plastic foot holding the crossbar broke. This resulted in my kayak skipping into the ditch. This is not a good product for any purpose. DON'T BUY IT
2,"Disappointed, does NOT work on all vehicles as advertised.","Tried these racks on my 2012 F150, my wifes 09 Odyssey, and my neighbors 2010 Tundra and the hooks wont hold on any of the vehicles. Wont hold on any rain gutters on the roof or hook inside the door, disappointed. I had to go out and spend more money to have longer straps with ratchets that would come inside the cab and secure it down. Not as advertised."
3,Cheap but works,"I purchased this for my 2007 Kia Rio. Racks fit alright and locked down securely after modifications. I carry my 60lb. Ocean kayak on top and when secured front to back and strapped to the rack I had no problem with the load coming loose.Construction is cheap, and while I did not expect Yakima or Thule quality I did expect better. Rack mounts are cheap plastic. I broke a tab off the mount when tightening the rack down. I had to bend the hooks to fit my door frame better. The pads will slip around on the roof, I coated the bottom of the pads with plasti-dip, a rubberized coating for tool handles, this works well to keep it from moving.While the rack works I would not trust just the mounting system to keep it on the car. Secure your load by either running the strap into the car and around the grab handles inside or tie it down front to rear like I did.For the money I'll make it work, I needed cheap and removable and that's what I got."
1,Extremely Disappointed !!,Anxiously waited for the product to be pleased by it's earlier than planned arrival. Took it out of the packaging read all the instructions and precautions to be assured to be placing it on the vehicle properly. After placing the carrier on the car I decide to do a quick double check of it's secureness and it breaks in one of the inlet slots where you put the straps through. Overall a very cheaply and poorly made weak prouct....but alas we get what we pay for....unfortunately...live and learn
1,Note good,"I would not recommend this item, it didn't fit properly on my car, the straps kept falling off and the plastic pieces that hold the bars cracked. I would not buy it if I were you, it is just a big headache and a waste of money."
5,Awesome deal!,"I needed to carry extra luggage and was doubtful this affordable solution would work. I attached cross bars at right angles and the set up worked beautifully. I did not have any trouble keeping rain our at the straps and have kept the roof carrier up on the car for future uses because it worked so well. It just made some noise at times, but was stable and reliable on a long trip."
1,Garbage,"I'm regretting taking the cheap route, this product is complete garbage! The mounts are made out of plastic, and as I was tightening the straps down, the plastic bar that the straps wrap around snapped off and made it useless. I tried to work around the one broken piece, but as I was trying to secure it again, the other side snapped! I rage hurled it to the garbage. AVOID THIS!"
2,Lightweight construction!,"Purchased this to use with J-carriers to transport two kayaks. The product looks fine, but the base units are plastic, and the tie downs connect around plastic pins. The second time we used it, the entire unit broke away from the car roof (thankfully I was able to stop fast, and no one was following). It appeared that once one plastic pin broke, they all failed in short order.This carrier might be just fine for more lightweight transport, and perhaps even for a single kayak sitting flat, but it was a near disaster for my application."
2,Flew off in the highway,"I installed this onto my wife's BMW to pick up our kid from college, in case she has extra stuff to bring home over the summer.She ended up not needing it and the rack stayed empty. On the way home one of the rack flew off in the middle of the highway going 70MPH. Thank goodness no one was behind her car or she could have hurt someone.I'm pretty handy and I installed this on really tight, but it still flew off..."
3,Hmm work great when it's not raining,Everything is great beside there will be water leaking from the straps if you tighten it up on the handle. The problem can be solved if you tighten it up with the buckles that come with the product.
3,"Looks nice, but...","It was a great price and it looked good, but I'll never know. I ordered this, put the box in my garage, and forgot about it for a while. When I opened it, both of the crossbars were missing. At that point, I noticed (as another reviewer mentioned) the item was sent from the Amazon.com Return Center. The return window has passed, so I'm stuck with some mounting brackets. At least they won't be able repackage them and send them off to some other unsuspecting customer."
4,Good product,Nice product for the money.It fits my 2012 Honda Civic and I was able to attach my Yakima ski rack( round bar)and it worked well.Im not sure it would be adequate for a heavy item such as my kayak but Ill find out.
2,Does NOT fit a Mazda5.,"While it may work on other vehicles, this is just a warning for those of you with a Mazda5. It causes the sliding doors to flex and allows water in."
4,Nice racks,"Its really nice, wide roof contact points are good they wont dent my roof. Only thing is the hooks to attach them don't fit my car right im going to have to modify them."
4,"Awesome, but smelly.","Pros:CheapEasy to assembleEasy to installMuch more stable than I expected.Able to hold a Klippan sofa easily.Fits in my trunk.Cons:Everything in the package smelled a little like gasoline when I first opened it. (if it wasn't for this, I'd have given it 5 stars.Other thoughts:I had to pull the door seal away from the frame to find a good place to attach the hooks. (doesnt' really count as a con, but it might be a bit confusing if you've never used a cheap roof rack before)Story:I got my rack about a week ago, and today I used it to haul a flat-packed Klippan sofa about 60 miles down the freeway on the roof of my Toyota Corolla with no trouble at all. A few ratchet straps to hold everything secured, and nothing so much as wiggled."
5,Great product for a great price!,I bought this because my girlfriend and I had to move 1200miles and all we had was my Subaru WRX to move in! The bars fit very nicely and secured very well! Very nice product for the price!
4,Great product at a low price.,A great product at a low price.Easy and quick to setup for my windsurf on my Ford Escort.
4,Good bars,Never used them for their intended purpose but once again I tweak things and they were sturdy and most useful.
4,"Great, Got the job done","Took it with bags and snow gear to Reno from San Diego, it held up great, felt very secure. EVen through blizzard conditions."
3,It looks ok. Worry about if it damage my car so I haven't install it.,Not very good quality. If you have a car less than 5 years I don't recommend it to you. For used old car it does the job.
4,Works great on older Corollas,"I have had a pair of these for around 5 years and have hauled everything with these christmas trees, doors, mattresses, even a 2 wheeled horse cart (several hundred miles). I use plenty of tie downs and reccomend a fore to aft tie down for large flat loads (doors/mattresses) or long distances. I have replaced the plastic pads with thicker shelf padding cut to fit since the pads have been lost. Other than that, no problems. They are secure, cheap and effective."
2,okay for a single kayak; but not for a cargo bag,"Well, we tried it out by itself (in other words, without something strapped to it. It was noisy, but stayed on without an obvious problems. Tried it with a kayak tied down to it. Still no problem, but noisier. Then we tried tying our new cargo bag to it instead of taking the straps from the bag through the car windows, and it totally slid off the back of the car on the parkway going no more than 65. What a waste."
2,doesn't stay flush on car,"we used this product to secure the Highland 15 Cubic Feet top carrier bag, however the bars wouldn't stay flush to the car. At least 2 of the pads were lost in transit, and had we not tied the straps to the inside handles we would have lost our entire load. If you have a Ford Focus... BEWARE"
1,Flimsy and non-durable,"The bars have very thin walls and cannot support any kind of load. The plastic towers are flimsy and crack or split within a few uses, so the bars are not secured. The tower feet are not attached and do not stay on when the racks are removed. The strap tightening hardware develops rust within a couple of weeks. This is a shoddily designed and contructed product. Not worth the money."
2,Ouch!,"Thought it was pretty secure on the roof with the buckles hooked into the roof lip. Just past Indianapolis on Rt#70 the whole load flew off the roof into the path of the car behind me. $200ticket plus damage to the other car. If you use this roof carrier, be sure to have a ratcheted belt going all the way around through the inside of the car."
4,Worked great.,Bought some swimming noodles from Walmart ($2). Split then down one side to cover the bars and keep the load from shifting. Was able to haul 5'x 8' windows although it looked like the Beverly Hillbilly's.
3,Scary,"I bought this carrier to carry a small sailboat. It was SCARY. It took me forever to put it together. Not because it is difficult, but because there is no way to make it fit snugly to the top of my WV Golf. It won't stay put until you close the doors, and it is only by closing the doors that it is somewhat secure (no matter how much you try to do it by tensioning the straps). Also, the metal pieces that are supposed to help them stay in place, ended up scratching my car (not too much, but still a scratch).Now, I have to admit that I went to pick my boat, loaded it (it is about 150 pounds) and drove it for ablut 20 miles at about 40 mph with peaks of 55 mph, and the thing didn't move a speck..... may be I was just too scared for no reason..."
3,Pity to close hatoum'work on a book,"The big art work of Mona Hatoum really don't are able to be close between to cover. Like her performance, her installation and sculpture are ugly and mute in a static and not-so-well-printed photografy book. Good is the intro, and the index of exibitions"
1,Not so great,These replacements are dull. Don't waste your money. Just buy a new set clippers. It's not easy being bald.
3,Won't order again due to unacceptable shipping cost,Product appears fine. I haven't needed to use it yet to verify sharpness. Shipping to AK. was OUTRAGEOUS!!!
4,Great Product/Good Seller,Great product/Good Seller will buy again from seller. Product came fast and as expected. Nice!
3,Blade arrived damaged.,"The outer blade was fine, but the inner blade arrived damaged. Since I needed it immediately, I was able to use the new outer blade with my older inner blade to get the job done. Of course now I cant return it since I used half of it. But only half arrived defective."
4,Nice blades but need honing,"I bought these blades to replace the two year old blades in my Wahl clippers. I installed the blades using the instructions provided but the new blades were loud and grabbed/pulled hair when I tried to use them. I was tempted to return them, but inspected them first and realized the machined surfaces on the inside of the blades (where the two slide against each other) were a little rough near the teeth cuts. I ran the blades across a sharpening stone a few times and knocked down the roughness, wiped down the blades, oiled them and put them back on and they work fine now. These are nice, sharp replacement blades but I shouldn't have to debur or hone them right out of the package."
2,U2 fans beware!,"Watch out if you are buying this CD because you are a U2 fan. The CD only has one U2 song --a techno remix of Mysterious Ways. Other than that, I found the CD dissappointing. The only other track I was familiar with was ""Zombie"" by the Cranberries. 98% of the CD is tracks by obscure Irish bands that range from boring to cute but not worth buying the CD for. It's not even as if U2 has submitted fresh material for this one. Unless you are looking for a sample of Irish rock culture, this CD is probably not for you."
4,Great bands Yanks have never heard of.,"Unlike the other people who reviewed this CD I have heard of most of the bands included. If you were fooled into buying it just because you thought it had a new U2 song on it..thank you for playing anyway. However, you are lucky enough to be introduced to music from a country where styles of music other than Rap, heavy metal and neo-punk are frequently played on the radio and thus each band sounds different. You will be introduced to the likes of Therapy and Ash, two well known bands on the more tasteful side of the pond, and you will get a copy of the Boomtown rats ""don't like mondays"", unbelievable! Stop whining and appreciate good music."
5,Breath of fresh air,I get tired of the repetitive top40 pop played over and over on the radio. I picked this CD up because I had 5 bucks left on a CD store gift card and this CD happened to be on sale. I must say that the music is incredible and I play it over and over in my car. I'm now on a crusade to find other international music as great as this.
3,It's not what you may think...,"Generally, I buy anything that has the Cranberries on it, so when I got the email notification about this CD, I bought it right away. But when it arrived, I realized that this definitely was not I thought it was. It is some sort of comp of Irish bands/singers. The Cranberries have only one song (Zombie) same with U2 (Mysterious Ways). There is only one other band (The Pogues) and one singer (Sinead) I have ever heard of.Overall, it's okay, but unless you collect the music of Irish bands ""just because"", I would recommend using your money to get The Cranberries ""Animal Instinct"" instead. Hope this helps!"
1,Not What You'd Think!,"I ordered this CD thinking I was getting a new U2 cd, not just a collection of other artist and only one U2 song (and a old song at that), I was disapointed."
2,Ehhh.... its alright.,"Well, at first I was wondering what this cd was, but now that the track listings are listed I know exactly what this cd is.This cd isn't actually ""new"". It actually came out a few years ago, BUT with a different title, ""Rock 'O the Irish"". ""Rock 'O the Irish"" and ""Emerald Rock"" have the same tracks.As other people have mentioned, none of the songs on here are ""new."" The only bands that I have really heard of are the cranberries, U2, and Sinead O'Connor who does a duet with Shane Mcgowan on Haunted(track 12).I bought this cd a few years ago and the only tracks I listen to are ""Zombie"" by the cranberries(but I hardly listen to it on this cd) and ""Haunted,"" a duet by Sinead and Shane. ""Haunted"" is a wonderful tune and worth the money if you're a big time Sinead O'Connor fan like myself. But other than that, you probably don't want to watse your time or money."
5,adrenal conspiracy,"This product rocks. here is some things to consider:Adrenals is root chakra. caffeine shuts down adrenals. we got starbucks etc. everywhere. nations are addicted to coffee. shut down root chakra and you shut down source of health. immune function etc. adrenals are in charge of more than 50 different hormones. its kidney chi. chinese cannot stop pointing out the importance of kidney chi and longevity. no root chakra your cut off from mother earth. this is how to control a population. shut them off from source. fear anxiety etc. will flourish. this is MASSIVE. ALL chakras are getting the energy from root and upwards. kundalini cannot rise without a fully functional root. this is how to stop awakening on this planet. feed fear, caffeine and fight or flight media manipulations........ get your adrenals back online. drop the stimulants. run on real energy."
1,Capsules one third empty.,"I purchased this product based on the glowing reviews from many other users. I just received my order yesterday and I am extremely disappointed. I took out the first two pills and noticed they were a little empty at the top of the capsule, which was weird. I poured the rest of the capsules out and ALL of them are are filled to about 2/3 of the capsule. I've never seen anything like it and I'm wondering if the reason it's such a low price is because the company is actually not giving your 240 capsules of product but instead making up the price difference with empty space. I've sent an email to amazon asking for an explanation, we'll see what happens."
1,"Never mind, it is not working for me","It didn't work for me at all. It destroyed my regular sleeping schedule. I was scared that it might made me deaf, because I could hear pingggggggggggggg............... sound everyday after eating this tablet."
5,Great stuff!,"My parents actually gave me a little sample bottle of 8 they had picked up. I took one one night to help me unwind and I ended up falling asleep on the couch, then going to bed. These things make me sleep like a baby!"
5,"Love Them, Healthy, Good for my Adrenals",I take a lot of supplements and some pre workout stimulants. This product is awesome. I feel healthier and I sense that I have more energy during the day. It is really good formrepairing my adrenal gland after caffeine.
5,Great product and it works,My good friend got me started on StressCare. I have found that it helps my body deal with stress more effectively. It doesn't make me sleepy or jittery. Its worth trying.
2,GREAT SAGA,this was one of the greatest sagas ever in the first dvd cell go's out looking for 18 and tien fight of cell awesome next goku shows up to save tien and the should be dead piccolo. then vegeta and trunks come out of the time chamber they have been training in so they go looking for cell and 18 cell and vegeta and trunks end up on the same island how conveinent vegeta kicks the crap out of cell then lets cell absorb 18 so he can have a challenge so cell becomes perfect then whips vegeta trunks tries to beat cell but he to fails cell announces the cell games and that is the saga
4,flawless........... not!!!,"this saga was great ive been watching dbz since i was 5 and its awesome!!!! ok when the fighting began it was brilliant but wen cell was transforming it was rubbish because for the whole episode all the z fighters were staring at him shaking for like half an hour the good thing was gohan became a super saiyan and goku put on the ""im a proud father"" look. another thing was weird though because trunks looked like broly and his yellow super saiyan bannana hair style changed!!!"
4,a pretty good and exciting dvd,this is a great saga. i think they extendied it a little to long though. i recommend buying it . i think they give gohan a little to much credit in this. i super saiyan 2 isnt that strong. only a little more than 1. also vegeta is to weak. if u r a true fan get this but if you just like hard core action and the best sets i am not shure if i would ge this. i would get majin buu. well averall it is a pretty good dvd
1,"Stansport Pack-Lite Pad (72X19X3/8-Inch, Blue)",I received but found one of them is scratched as soon as I opened the package. I believe it was scratched before it was packed in the box. I need to credit some amount to me for this damage on the pad .
1,My Goof???,Adore James Patterson (and assorted collaborators). Pre-order every new one...BUT always Hardcover AND English.El 3er Grado arrived in Paperback and Spanish...SURPRISE!!!! No Comprende!Guess I pushed a wrong button; so gave it away...hopefully to someone who could enjoy discovering Patterson in their lingo. He'd be great in any language! But not for Me.
5,They never answer their emails!,"Chaps!Without doubt the quintessential 90's jazz funk revival record!The london and ny funksters agree.....i just bought my fifth copy since i've lent and nevr retrieved it or its been just plain nicked...I've asked to come and play parties here in the US where they'll get a huge crowd but no dice....Simon (the guitarist) has a mate from school called Barry Cronin who say's they are bit up their own backsides.....PS for a continuation try and grab a rare copy of ""High Havoc"" the second. After that it goes a bit sour......the new one though ""Clik"" is ace....Cheers Chuckles"
3,Bish Bash Bosh,"Gotta Get Some Bish Bash Bosh is a witty and entertaining book. I was immediately convinced of the narrator's absolute charm and maturity (all right, so he has some improvements to make, who doesn't?) and drawn into his epic campaign for popularity and confidence. This book is the perfect source for some good laughs, as well as a few helpful tips on how to achieve inner fulfillment in the face of bad hair cuts, unenthusiastic parents, and disloyal girlfriends."
5,Untouchable modernist - preacher man,"This is some of the most uncanny acoustic work ever heard and goes down with R.Johnson to the core of the blues and all music as a matter-o-fact. i even heard that doug martsch did a concept record based on Fred Mcdowell. or something like that. if this don't turn you into a hippie, i don't know what will -"
3,White LIghtnin',The movie didn't stay true to the death of D Ray White (Jesco's father). I thought that the actor that portrayed Jesco did a good job though and the movie kept my interest.
1,What a disappointment!,"I've seldom if ever rated a video 1 star. I had watched a recent documentary about the Whites, so was looking forward to this movie. However, though it's supposed to be based on the life of Jesco White, it's a travesty. None of the trashiness or criminal bent of the family is portrayed, and Jesco is alive and well today--unlike the Jesco of the movie. The casting and acting are poor. Just an awful film"
1,NOT about Jesco,"Terrible portrayal of beloved Jesco. I wonder what he thinks of this portrayal of himself, because it is more of a betrayal in my mind. I don't know why they felt they had to base it on Jesco. Why not give it another name and leave Jesco out of it. If you love the dancing outlaw, DON'T waste your time on this. You will be disappointed."
1,Son of a Feminist,"The book examines many women's perspectives, but never once examines the sons' perspective and the obvious question of the negative impact of feminist male bashing on sons. I was ""orphaned"" by feminism as it lead my Mom not only to divorce my Dad, but also to champion women at every turn over even me, her own flesh and blood. Now at 53 I see the hollowness of my Mom's assertions that men always have advantages and that there is some male conspiracy out there to ensure my success over women. My Mom's feminist teachings merely made me a tool for women's agendas, which could never include my own success since I was a man. My Mom's feminism not only separated me from my father, it separated me from her and set me up for a life of exploitation by less deserving but more politically savy feminists in the academy."
3,Great concept but slow moving,"My then 3 year old son found this game to be boring and we never completed a round. At age four he is likewise bored. My daughter probably would have enjoyed it at that age, but she possessed more patience."
4,fun toy for preschooler,"Colorama is a great first game for preschooler! This game teaches colors, shapes, and turn-taking. Will use it with my next child too."
4,get lots of use from this,My daughter loves playing with this game and it is one of the few that a two year old understands. It has helped her learn her colors and shapes tremendously. There is also many different ways to play so you can make it your own. The only downfall is that the board is cardboard and my child can be rough with her toys. Plastic would have been better.
4,Good Game,This is a good toy for learning colors and shapes - there are lots of different ways of playing so it can appeal to multiple ages and kids - unfortunately is can be a bit repetitive but the repetition is good for learning.
2,"Interesting SW history, but hard to like","'Golden Age of the Sith', as the other Tales of the Jedi books, is a bit of a hard sell for fans and non fans. Fans of Star Wars will buy this book to complete their collections, and just might enjoy it for it's historic tale set in the far past of the Star Wars continuity. However, the tale is so bizarre that it bears almost no resemblance to the current Star Wars universe. For some it might be a drawing point, but I think others will be turned off by this. Non fans will turn away, as the story isn't particularly intriguing and the art is sub-par. The rest of the 'Tales of the jedi' stories are much better."
4,"Pretty good, but not the best in the serier","The Golden Age of the Sith was an OK book. The artwork was functional and the storyline was interesting. Also, the information on the Sith Empire makes it a good read. However, it does suffer from a few problems, mainly that the two main characters needed to be more involved in the story. As it is, they were just kind of ""there,"" stumbling into major events at random. Other than that, this is book was pretty good, but there are better ones in the series."
4,"Impresive background reading for ""Dark Lords of the Sith""","Well, I liked it because in Dark Lords of the Sith, it tells about Exar Kun finding and finishing Naga Sadow's work. This tells about Sadow, about his ambitions, and I also like info about the unification about the Emprise Teta Systum. I'm into haveing background information on things I read about, and this gives more background than I could have hoped for The events in Dark Lords of the Sith and Naga Sadow himself"
3,Confusing start for the Old Republic Jedi,"On the SW time line this is the first of the OLD REPUBLIC ERA stories released Aug 1997. Written by Kevin j Anderson, author of the JEDI ACADEMY TRILOGY (1994), KJA is one of the more important writers in the SW universe, or at least he was. He wrote the young jedi series, and those kids are now the heart of the jedi in the NJO series of books. He also wrote the Essential chronology with Daniel Wallace released in 2000. These old republic are comics have been criticized as almost unrecognizable from the jedi that luke is training.It is not my job to defend KJA and his story, but times were different. What I can't explain away is the poor editing. All the ORE comics are confusing as heck. Most of them have no importance to the Skywalker era. The art work that gets a C grade, but Darkhorse has made tremendous strides in later comics. Comics produced in 2002 and 2003 have stunning artwork! I'll give this comic a 3 star review for starting things off."
5,"Epic Adventure, A great escapist read",This book goes beyond great graphics and has a good story line and plot. Character are well developed and have depth. Its fun to read and goes a long way to tie up loose ends in George Lucas's stories.
2,not very good,i read all the tales of the jedi comics lately and the best thing you can say about this one is at least it's not as bad as fall of the sith empire. poorly done
5,Way cool!!!,"The character developments of Memmit Nadil and Odan-Uur were great! The art is abseloutly incredible! If you are an aspiring artist, use the scetches in the back for references!"
4,An Excellent Album,"Glossary is an indie rock band hailing from Murfreesboro, TN. They offer a mix of alternative, folk, and melody to form an excellent second album..."
5,excellent,"I very much enjoy this product. However, I can not find it in stores. And I hate to pay postage or shipping on it all the time. The stores that say they carry it don't. Not sure what to do."
2,"General Foods International Coffee, Cappucino Cooler, French Vanilla, 6-Count Single Servings in Box (Pack of 8)",Personally it is the cost that is to much with shipping but you you can't get out to shop it is fine
5,My family loves these,"We discovered these drink mixes several years ago, and have loved them ever since, but they are getting harder and harder to find. I like that you mix them with real milk, so they're good for you, and they're just so refreshing. I have introduced them to lots of friends and coworkers who ask what I'm drinking all the time, and everyone loves them."
2,Not so good. More plucky and snippy.,"Have a real problem with nosehairs. My grow quickly and I can't stand the feel or look of them. This product is simple enough in design and I like that it is not battery operated. However, for me it just didn't seem to get the job done well enough. I found it to pluck my nosehairs more than a nice clean snip or cut. Seemed to work best when I closed the blades then twisted the unit with the hairs ensnared between them. Of course, this wasn't so comfortable as it was really just plucking the hairs out. Have a hard time recommending this product."
4,Great Sound Track!,"OK...so for anyone who wants to know what Wing Chun is, and how it is different from most other schools of Kung Fu, this is actually pretty good. There are explanations of all the underlying principles (centerline theory, economy of motion, etc) and explanations of things like Sil Lim Tao (one of the open handed forms). This was made by one of Bruce Lee's trainers under Yip Man, and judging from the production quality, Bruce was still very much alive when this was made :P What really makes this a must have for any 70's kung fu enthusiast is the soundtrack! It's the real deal! Dirty grooves reminiscient of Hong Kong porn, or perhaps ""Kung Fu Panda Slam"" are sure to delight."
1,1980's content with a 2008 cover,"Wow... that's all I can say (and that's not a good thing). The cover for this dvd makes it look like the latest in state of the art CSI style body dynamics. The reality that it's a 1980's VHS tape that has been transferred to a DVD and sold as something new and different. Whoever designed the cover sure knew how to use photoshop. The quality is horrific, the sound static filled, and unless you're looking to learn Wing Chun for a break dance-battle don't buy this."
3,Wing Chun,"This is very basic. If you know anything, don't get this. Wasted my money on this. For $14, I expected much more."
2,Helpful but skimpy,"This dvd is somewhat helpful, but has no real depth to it.It is dated, which isn't really bad, but you will notice it and I would like to make you aware of it.It got a 2 star rating because it is Wing Chun, because routines were done right and because the price was right.If you are looking for a home course to make you good at Wing Chun, this may help but it will not make you an expert by any stretch of the imagination."
5,A Classic!,Master Wong Shun Leung intended to do a series of instructional dvds on the Wing Chun system. I would love to see more if they are available. This is a CLASSIC!
3,Review 7june2009,"Handling took a while, but the waiting is being rewarded with good quality dvd. It shows you techniques, application and the complete first form by WSL himself. I hope they can make a dvd by WSL for the other forms as well.."
1,This Sucks,"You'd be better off purchasing an old kung fu movie.. DO NOT buy this DVD in any form!!It sucks,It sucks,It sucks"
4,A review by a beginner in Wing Chun,"Video quality is good considering the age of the original footage. English dubbing was OK, but I also expected the original Chinese to be available. Oh well ....A pretty basic introduction to the main Wing Chun philosophy, centre line theory, gates, etc.Good demonstration of the basic footwork and how to apply it. Brief run through of the first form: Sil Lim Tao and applications.What I enjoyed the most was towards the end with the 2-man scenarios. Sifu Wong would demonstrate a technique taken from Sil Lim Tao which one of his students would counter, then the next scene would be his counter to the counter.You won't be able to learn Wing Chun from this DVD, but it is a good overview of the Wing Chun philosophy and some very well filmed sequences. I'm sure I will dip into this periodically as my own Wing Chun training progresses.Sifu Wong died in 1997 so there is no follow up video demonstrating the next form: Chum Kiu (Searching for the Bridge). A great shame."
1,HP support of psc 2X10 All-in-One printer line.,"I bought a predecessor to the PSC 2610, the PSC 2410 Photosmart all-in-one 21 months ago and have only used it for one replacement set of cartridges. The printer stopped working and HP has determined that the printer has a hardware problem and offered to sell me a 2610 for $ 156.I have had 3 other HP printers, use other printers at work and am accustomed to printers lasting for several years. I do not know if HP's quality standards have changed, but they do not feel obligated to do anything more for me after the one year warranty has expired.X HP customer"
5,A Screaming Bargain!,"To anyone who loves Beethoven Symphonies, enjoys great sounding recordings and loves to find incredible bargains: Folks, this set is for you.The Berlin gang has never sounded so inspired and energetic--yes, even more so than for the ""big K"" himself. The performances are shaped with outstanding artistry by Cluytens and the original analog sound trumps many of the modern digital (and also SACD) recordings presently on the market. It is a triumph for all concerned!If you don't buy it before EMI (eventually) pulls the plug, you'll regret it."
4,Eraserhead meets The Aristocracts meets Fellini.,"Very weird, with an Eraserhead type of vibe. Lots of profanity, almost as much as in ""the Aristocrats"". Random flashes of insight and interesting visuals a la Fellini. Not for everyone, but I'm glad I saw it."
4,Witch in the House by Ruth Chew,"This is an unusual witch story in which the witch is basically good but absent-minded, needing the help of two girls who are best friends. The girls are rewarded with some fantastic travel adventures from two unlikely sources. Also unlike most other witch stories, it has year-round appeal, not just at the time of Halloween. The story shows the children's independence, industriousness, and their willingness to help others even when the tasks required are at times unpleasant for them."
3,"Great looking, not so great wearing","Let me say that I haven't been as pleased when opening a shoe box as I was when I received these in a long time! They look even more fabulous in real life. I wore them for the first time on a night out with friends - only a few blocks of walking and then mostly sitting. Suffice it to say that I COULD NOT WAIT to get these shoes off! They are really uncomfortable: my toes were squished (even though there's room at the heel), and there is no padding on the sole. If you buy these, invest in some gel inserts for the heel and the ball of the foot. They look so great that I'll continue wearing them - I'll just put them on at the last moment!"
4,"Room for toes, adequate padding","I usually wear a 9 or 9.5, so I ordered a 9, but I will have to exchange for an 8.5 in this shoe. However, there was an amazing amount of room in the toe box, both in height and length. There are extra heel pads in the box, and these were pretty comfortable! My only curiosity about this item is how well the material will wear - the lacquered fabric is definitely durable, but I wonder if it will crease with wear?In case anyone is wondering, my wife posted this through my account. I don't wear heels.-CL"
5,I love these shoes,"I own 4 pairs of Naughty Monkey shoes. There are not many shoes that comapre to them, even though they are high heels, they are very comfortable."
2,"Cute Design, quality lacking","I usually love Naughty Monkey shoes! The quality is always top notch and the designs are so different. I really loved the color and look of these shoes. However, they are made of some kind of basket weave straw materical or something. When I got them out of the box they were already kind of falling apart near the sole and heel. I could just imagine with a couple wears they would just get worse. I take care of my shoes and I have a shoe man who resoles, cleans, patches and puts new tips on my heels. He would not have been able to fix these."
3,Nice shoe,"Good shoe. If you like shoes that are different, then this is it. However, I think that the picture looks better than the actual shoe."
3,More of the same from taiwan_guy . . .,"Continuing on from what I wrote previously, why is is that these books can be so unhelpful? The answer seems to be that the authors decided to spread all of the explanations of the language items across all three books - so that one book on its' own will have language items which may then not be explained until the second or third book!I only realised this last night when, thoroughly frustrated at 12:30am and almost ready for bed, I happened to look at the ""Grammar index"" and put two and two together.The upshot, therefore, is that you will not get the full benefit of these books unless you buy all three and can actually therefore _look_ at _all three_ while you are studying. Buying just the first one is helpful but there are too few explanations of the grammar items in any one book; you must have all three."
3,Korean Through English 2,The Korean through English series I find kind of strange. I really enjoy the dialoges how they make them entertaining however the grammar in this book is not well explained. I don't suggest this series if you are a novice because you basically have to guess how to use the grammar it tries to tell you about.
5,Aimed at Teens just Beginning to do Movies,"The technology has changed so that producing a movie is not (quite) the daunting task that it once was. Modern cameras and video editing software make the production of a movie far different than it was in the days of film. In fact, the authors recommend that you start with a quite basic camers. They are much easier to use, while the professional level cameras have so many controls and adjustments that using them becomes a task in itself.The video editing software package that the authors use is based on the Apple computer (don't tell me you're surprised at this), but they also list several packages that run on Windows and which do a perfectly acceptable job of editing.The CD that comes with the book contains a movie, the script and directors comments on that movie and video clips that you can use for practice editing. There are also several sound files suitable for editing. The demo software included on the disk is mostly Apple oriented."
4,Students love the book,My after school students really enjoy this book. It has been check out many times and my students use it often as a reference.
4,Something all Fathers should consider,"Not really having much information about my father, and being a father that wants to pass on something of significance to my children, I found this to be a very enriching book.There are a couple of chapters toward the end that drag a little regarding how Vaughn went from leading a lunch group to championing a ministry.It is a very quick read, and is packed full of encouragement, I would highly recommend it."
1,frustrated buyer,I didn't realize the company sending the product could substitute another companies product. The ad clearly read Roux Fanci-ful Rinse#21 Blush Brown (by Roux). They sent me Fanciful Hair Rinse #21. The Roux name isn't on the bottle. What I thought I was purchising was a professional product and what I got was something anyone can buy at many stores locally. This seems like deceptive advertising to me.
3,Good product but small buttle,I got the package in time.A Good productIn the picture it seems big but it is a small bottle.
3,Smaller bottle,"I was pleased with the low price for this item, but was surprised upon receiving it that the bottle had fewer ounces than the same product available at other sites that indicated 12oz or 10oz bottles, of course at a higher price. The size of the bottle I received has only 9oz, which should have been disclosed in the ad. Of course, that accounts for the cheaper price. However, service was prompt."
2,Zone diet book,I would have to say that this book is good but if you want recipies for the diet find another book. there are a limited number of recipies in general and if you are a pickey eater or don't like a certain type of food i would reccommend getting another zone book.
