5,Rolando Villazon,"As musicians ourselves, we are of the opinion than Rolando Villazon is one of the greatest, if not the greatest tenor of this time. His voice reminds of great ones of the past like Gigli and Frits Wunderlich."
1,Anything Goes (The original cast with Ethyl Merman),Very disappointing!! Too much space relegated to the British cast and the horrible French chanteuse who was the female star. Not enough of Ethyl Merman and the Broadway cast. A waste of money!!
1,How did it sound then?,"This record enables us to compare authentic historical performances of this famous score. The London Reno. for instance, brings a completely different approach to the songs from that of Merman, who created the role. Porter's own performances give a living room intimacy to the songs. The inclusion of songs now interpolated into revivals is a bonus."
1,Does Not Fit 2004 Toyota Tundra,"I ordered these cables in March for my 2004 Toyota Tundra and had them shipped to me in Jamaica. After the 3 week wait... The cables seemed to be of a quality build but they were too short for my pickup even though Amazon said they fit. It's going to be hard to return them so I'll just have to keep them until someone I know needs a pair. Could someone give me some info on which cables to buy? I measured the old ones and they measure 17"" center to center."
1,You Can't Judge a Book by the Title on the Cover,"This book should be titled ""Moving into Management for the Technical Professional."" Less than twenty pages are devoted to project management. I gave it one star for meeting the expectations of the title, but for the actual topic covered it rates a three or four. It discusses the challenges and pitfalls for a technical professional who moves into the role of managing other technical professionals. And also gives good guidance on how your thinking must change to be successful in your new role."
1,Waste of money,"Do you like songs the way you heard them on the radio or original records? And not some ""do-overs"" made after the fact?If so, you are not going to be happy with this collection. Most of the songs on this set are poor imitations of the original hits, I'm not even sure if they are performed by the artists as stated on the box. Do yourselves a favor and let my misfortune benefit you. Spend your money on ""real hits""."
1,NOT the Original Recordings,"These are not the original recordings. Every song appears to be RE-recordings of the songs by the original artists or someone who sounds like them. Instrumentation sounds the same on every song, and the sound quality is very thin."
1,doo wopp collection,"Just plain poor quality folks, poor quality.My best guess is it sounds like someone recorded it at home.I wasted a lot of money on this one.Sorry, but that is the way I see it."
5,Helpful on the job,"This device is easy to install, simple to operate, and does a fine job. I do medical transcription for a physician, and when he moved his office 12 miles away, a logistical problem arose regarding stat transcription. Now he can call, and I can turn on the device and record his dictation on my transcriber via the phone line. There are better options out there for this purpose, but they cost thousands of dollars. This was an inexpensive quick fix that works well when emergencies arise on the job."
1,Range Busters,Poor video quality on this movie - The 2nd feature was a better quality - neither was good.
3,Turtle Tube,"My 5 year old loves nature and was very excited to receive this gift. He plays with them a lot. They are very durable and have a wide variety of species. I wish they came with a description of the different types of frogs including name, range and special characteristics. Even a link to read more about the frogs so I could add an additional educative experience around the toys."
4,ALL WIRED UP!!!!!!!!!,for the cheap price for this it was a great buy this is good if your tv has onley one vidio jack
4,great gift,I bought this gift for my granddaughter who is 10. She has had many enjoyable hours putting these bracelets together and showing them off. She and her friends will compete with each other as to who can be more creative! I wouldn't recommend for younger girls. For girls 9-12.
3,Not worth the $ - buy some thread and a book instead,"I opened the box, and though the outside looks great, what is inside is rather lame. A few skeins of thread and some beads, which were all over the package, plus some cheap hair clips and some (rusted!) bobby pins. There is a tiny little paper instruction book (book? - maybe 3 pages) but that's it. You'd be better off buying a friendship bracelet book and some embroidery thread separately and wrapping them up in the same box. It's too bad - I was really excited about this gift for my sister."
2,THE COLORS ARE PRETTY BUT ....,"ONCE YOU OPEN THE PACKAGE, THE KIDS WILL NOT BE TOO HAPPY THAT SOON ALL GETS TANGLED ... THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE ALSO NOT SO EASY ... HARDER YET THE LACK OF TOOLS TO HELP ACHIEVE THE RESULTS BUT IF YOU DO LEARN HOW TO MAKE A BRACELET YOU WILL BE HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS, SPECIALLY WITH THE FACT THAT, YOU MAY END UP WITH PATIENCE AS A VIRTUE YOU NEVER KNEW YOUHAD BEFORE THIS DAY."
1,Easily the most pathetic poker book I have ever read!!!,"Of the 10-15 poker books I have purchased, this is easily the biggest waste of money. The practice questions were fit for a 3rd grader and I can honestly say I leared less than nothing. I take that back, I learned that I know a little about poker already.Save your money, purchase dan harringtons books instead."
1,Not Good!,"The stitching fell all to pieces at the first washing. Having it repaired by my seamstress seemed like a better alternative than shipping it back to sender, but now I'm not so sure. It continues to shed. Don't buy this purported bargain."
1,Poor Quality,"The robe was on sale for $37.00,reduced from $75.00. poor quality even at $37.00.Did not fit correctly. Returned item and paid postage both ways and got a refund of $28.00."
2,Too Small,"The product description says one size fits most, thisrobe is a medium at best I'm 6'2"" 230lbs. And thisproduct won't come with in 6"" of closing.you should keep this in mind when ordering."
2,Does the job but not worth the price,"I can't say that it's not soft or that it doesn't dry well, but after 4 months it already looks extremely old and the stitching is coming off everywhere. Quite poor quality for the price, even with the extreme discount. I'd rather have spent something more to get something better.One size can't and shouldn't fit all... I'm 5'1 and tiny and this is ridiculously big for me."
1,Lightweight navy blue terry bathrobe 100 % cotton 501,The company is bad. They never sent the robe. I would never do business with this company again.
4,Bathrobe,We purchased this bathrobe as a gift for our oldest son. He is thoroughly pleased with it. Says is very comfortable. This helps him a lot because he currently is going through a tough time mourning the loss of his son Marine Sergeant Sean Lagrand.
4,Unsurpassed pre-SPICE filter design reference,"Zverev is the classic reference for continuous time filter design, especially lumped element LC ladder filters. The book is mostly tables, but the plots of filter behaviour for different designs--ripple, group delay, and so on, are easily worth the price. The discussion of how to synthesize a bandpass, bandpass, or bandstop filter from a lowpass prototype is very useful. They don't teach this stuff in school any more!"
4,Not a 'Sailing to Philadelphia' but....,".....stands it's own among the current crop. My favourite song is 'Devil Baby'. Sounds something off a Nick Drake album, except ofcourse for the extra instruments."
2,What happend to MK?,"The latest cd from MK is in many way a disappointment! There is some good lyrics and MK has for sure improved his singing but that's not very unik. Where is that guitar-man we love to listen to? Golden Heart was nothing but excellent and I don't know how many times I have played that CD, and MK:s second solo album Sailing To Philadelphia was also great, but what happened to his latest recording? I use to admire Mark Knopflers music and especially -of course- his wonderful guitar playing, but MK:s latest effort is not what you would expect from such a talent guitarist and musician. MK, go back to what you once was! Or do you dont't really care about your guitar and your unik sound anymore? MK used to be able to put together some wonderful music but The Ragpickers Dream is nothing but some kind of ordinary recording and even if I try I have a hard time appreciate his latest album. The Ragpickers Dream is certainly not a ""MK-guitar-picking-fans dream"" in the record player:("
1,"Disappointed after ""Sailing""","Judging from the other reviews I'm very much in the minority here but I was very disappointed with this follow up to Sailing. Mark is a huge talent and if he wants to make an esoteric album that's fine, but I wish I had had some warning before plunking down my hard earned bucks for this turkey. Just too personal and quirky for my tastes. Destined for immediate obscurity."
3,Ragpicker's Dream,"Vey laid back Knopfler, superb guitar work but thats what we expect from him. I liked some of the country influenced instrumentation but it needed more. I wanted a track to jump out of the speakers and shake me up....it didn't happen."
4,Another Gem For This Sultan Of Swing,"The Ragpicker's Dream is another fine recording from former Dire Straits leader, Mark Knophler. This CD takes on a more acoustic format so if you like the electric/Dire Straits sound you may be shocked and a bit dissappointed.There are several captivating melodies. The swing flavored Quality Shoe is a nice toe tapping tune. The title track has a nice homey feel to it with a little holiday sentiment in the air. A Place Where We Used To Live and Fare Thee Well Northumberland feature some nice interplay between the guitars and the piano. Love the folky feel of the later one.Its good to see musicians step out and grow. Mark Knophler is certainly adding new elements to his repetoire and this makes The Ragpicker's Dream a charming CD."
5,Can Do No Wrong,Has Mark Knopfler every done an album that was not fantastic. The tradition continues here. If Mark has a new album Amazon.com can just go ahead and ship it to me on the day it comes out!
2,"I understand it`s folk, but why?!","I dont got much to say about this album. Huge disappointment would fit nicely. While ""Sailing to Philadelphia"" was a major success and something for everyone, ""The Ragpickers Dream"" is a..well its not a bad record, for its not! I just cant stand it. This review is not to say its bad, its to warn those who think it is something like ""Sailing to Philadelphia"". I thought it was, and bought it. I wasnt particularly happy after it was finished. 2 great songs, ""Why Aye Man"" and ""The Ragpickers Dream"" isnt enough to make the record good. They are the only two songs who could have fit on STP.I dont know what to say about this. I am a huge fan of his Dire Straits style, with his slideguitars and catchy riffs, but they are gone! Listen to this album before you even think of buying it. Lets hope Mark changes his mind on the next album, giving us a varied rock album with great songs and guitarplaying."
3,Now Mark likes his music but...,"I'm a big fan for a long time. So my opinion is not very dispassionate : i'll listen this album a lot of time. But the Knopfler we like (love) is the guitar man and there is no guitar in this album. I think he has recorded a CD only for himself. He has improved his way of singing and the songs are not bad but there are plenty other CD's like this one. One of the best track of TRD, ""Hill farmer blues"" is cut just at the moment the drum restart the song. Very frustrating!.However, a positive aspect of this album is the rootsy approach : more bluesy, country, jazzy: between golden heart, on every street and notting hillbillies.To conclude, don't worry Mark, i'll buy even a single star album."
5,AWESOME,"if you love music with wonderful story lines, played by a master craftsman of the picking technique.. this is your CD. Devil Woman and Coyote are my favorites on this record but they all are good. MK takes a very genteel turn on this record, just relying on his fingers and it is brilliant."
5,Vivid and varied images from Knopfler continue,"At 47, I am a long time fan of Mark Knopfler's work. I like a good love song as much as anybody but I am always looking to MK for music which takes me to other times and places and introduces fascinating characters. To me, his music often seems like a scene in a good movie. His masterful and distinctive style is becoming nearly as fully realized as one of his own personal icons, Chet Atkins."
3,Now Mark likes his music but...,"I'm a big fan for a long time. So my opinion is not very dispassionate : i'll listen this album a lot of time. But the Knopfler we like (love) is the guitar man and there is no guitar in this album. I think he has recorded a CD only for himself. He has improved his way of singing and the songs are not bad but there are plenty other CD's like this one. For instance,one of the best track of TRD, ""Hill farmer blues"" is cut just at the moment the drum restart the song. Very frustrating!.However, a positive aspect of this album is the rootsy approach : more bluesy, country, jazzy: between golden heart, on every street and notting hillbillies.To conclude, don't worry Mark, i'll buy even a single star album."
2,Give it up Mark...,Hearing Mark Knopfler without Dire Straits is like eating cereal without milk- it's dry and boring. If Knopfler has such an aversion to playing with his former band he should just retire because he's not doing his career any favors. I gave this cd two stars instead of one because it's decent background music...but that's about it.
1,"Yawn,Mark knopfler sucks!",Mark knopfler is one of the most boring singers ever.All his albums suck terribly and are ideal for insomniacs as it pull put anybody to sleep.Dont buy this album.GET ANY ROLLING STONES ALBUM INSTEAD.
1,"Oh no ,not at all","Mark Knopfler is so boring both in Dire Straits and as as well as a solo artist.He only made a single decent song in Sultans of swing.To the reviewer named For whom the bells toll a.k.a Whirligig,your opinion on great bands like LED ZEPPELIN,PINK FLOYD,LYNYRD SKYNYRD and THE ROLLING STONES has not been asked for.Leave those great bands alone and go and listen to your awful Green day and foreigner.Ragpickers dream is very very boring.DONT PURCHASE THIS,BUY LED ZEPPELIN'S FOURTH ALBUM instead."
1,"Lousy, lousy","This fit my instrument cord okay, but the fit inside my recorder's plug receptacle was loose. I was able to record more noise than signal. Spend an extra dollar or two for a better quality product.Returning this item would have been more hassle (and more expensive) than just buying something better. I gave it to my local second-hand store. Maybe someone else can make better use of it, though I have my doubts."
3,This is MONO,"If you are looking for a stereo adapter, watch out... this one is mono. It says so right in the description, but not in the title."
1,"Mono, and reduces quality significantly","First of all, if you hadn't noticed, this adapter is mono, so it's not good as a headphone adapter. Second, it drastically reduces the sound quality. Spend a few bucks and get something nicer."
1,The title of this book is decieving,"This book is a human resource management book covering different areas in HR management with many boring and tedious examples. The book focuses on interview setting questions, employement and hiring. I was looking for a book on language, word structure and influencing techniques but this book is the complete opposite. In addition, this book does not have a ""search inside"" option nor a description."
5,Absolutly awesome,"Words That Change Minds: Mastering the Language of Influence 2nd editionIf I would have bought this book first, before buying any other, it would have been my only purchase, for a while. Until I would have digested the material.It lies at the core of NLP and the communication process. Shelle Rose Charvet has a unique insight into the subject that is easy to grasp. Not only can you understand what she is writing about, but she also provides plenty of clear and easy to understand examples.It is the only book that I carry with me all the time. I really do not have a desire to finish it, much less rush the process.Each paragraph is full of relevent information that triggers associated experiences, which you start using immediately to create your own scenarios and start experiencing what you've read."
1,Not what I expected,"I am a hypnotherapist and I was looking for something to compliment that line of thinking. This book was not it. It is targeted at the business world. Perhaps persons in management could use it, but for everyday conversation, it doesn't help."
5,Empowerment,A must-read-book!This book is an excellent choice to empower yourself and others. It touches the exact points of everyday life; especially in the workplace when dealing with supervision and co-workers.
2,Same Old Story,"If you have never read a book on this topic its ok, otherwise just reread and study the one you already have."
1,It is obvious ...,"... from reading the reviews for this book that it is not worth the time or money it costs. Not one single review uses words that compel or even just get close to making a sale of the book. A remedial version for all the reviewers must be in the works because the author can't be depending upon this book to produce any significant income. If the positive reviews are unable to ""change minds"" then what good is this book?"
3,Great concept -- needs a good editor.,"Charvet's concept warrants more than just a read-through of her book. I intend to study the material until I get the hang of her very sound principles. Hopefully in subsequent printings, this worthy book will receive the attention of a good editor (to catch some typos and awkward phrasing), and the trained eye of a seasoned typographer (to visually present the text and charts in an easier-to-grasp format). It deserves the best presentation."
3,Why so expensive?,Why in the world would the price for this item be $1498.99??? Is that a typo? Who in their right mind would purchase a kid's book for this much? Ridiculous!!!
5,Snarling Dogs Picks,"These picks are great. They are, by far, the easiest picks to hold onto without slippage, due to their textured back and front. Also, the tin box, they come in, is great for keeping them all together."
5,Brings back the good old days.,"This looks exactly like the megatron figure I used to have as a kid. It's gun mode looks like a Walther P-38 with a scope and silencer, it even comes with plastic bullets you can shoot with it. It's transformation to robot mode is as easy and smooth as always. This Takara reissue comes with a sweet looking ball and chain weapon.The only thing that seems weird, and it might be me, but I can't seem to get the chamber piece that also makes up his chest back down over the gun barrel when converting it back to gun mode, can anyone tell about that? Over all though a really awesome addition to anyone's transformers collection."
3,"Looks great,but.....","Just purchased for my almost 4 year old son. We need to work on letter recognition and writing skills and this looked perfect. My main issue with the item is that even when I write some of the letters to show him how to use the toy, it doesn't always recognize the letter...even when I'm being particularly careful to apply even pressure on the writing surface, moving the pen slowly and being very precise in the strokes. Makes me think that a 4 year old has very little chance of getting it ""right"" according to the computer."
3,"Good idea, needs more development","I bought this toy because I saw that it has been developed since an earlier version to make it more able to recognize a young child's writing. My son got this for his 4th birthday and I was quite excited about it, however, I'm disappointed because when he uses it, the toy often corrects him unless he writes a perfectly straight line. His motor skills are good but it still tells him he's not correct and he has become very frustrated with it."
2,Save your money...,"I bought this item for my four year old who is learning to write, and it is very frustrating. As other reviewers have said, even when I tried to write the letters as the toy instructs, I was told that the letters were not correct. The toy does have some games that my son likes and some songs that he enjoys, but overall I would not recommend this toy until the technology improves. Save your money and invest in a chalkboard and chalk which is far cheaper and much more rewarding."
1,"Awful Quality. Thankfully, there is better.","As verified by someone else's review, the picture quality jumps around from ""decent"" to ""poor."" A couple episodes are so difficult to watch you'll be forced to skip to the next episode. A few of them have been edited and the closing credits don't match with the episode (apparently very poor editing, why would you want to see who is in the cast you just watched when the closing credits belong to a different episode?). Worse, the company superimposed their company logo on the corner of the screen. Very annoying. The packaging is very attractive, I'll give them that. But it's the only thing attractive and good about these DVDs. If you want superb quality, I recommend you get the 25-disc box set from CoverOut dot com because their product is much, much better. I bought a set last month and have been pleased all the way."
1,Major disappointment,"Total agreement w/ last reviewer.Vol 1 (not labeled as one) has at least two shows that are on other discs in this series. No attempt to properly sequence in order of showing. Expected less than perfect quality due to age of shows, but quality much poorer than restored discs of this same vintage. Also most disappointing that the end credits were often copies of end credits from another show. One of the good things about watching vintage shows/films is discovering people who were bit actors then who later become stars.Super Roy Rogers fans, be prepared for a major disappointment."
1,unhappy after shipping,"My son received this dragon for Christmas and was real unhappy to find out it either didn't survive the shipping experience or it was faulty to begin with. Even after new batteries, the legs wouldn't walk and the other features did not work, oh but the sound effects did!"
4,A Dealer to Be Trusted,The dealer included all the accurate and pertinent information in the description of the book. The condition was as described and shipment was prompt.
2,Playboys play bad,After years of enjoying Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys I found Vol 4 slow and unemotional.
3,Will he ever learn to play the saxaphone?,"The Bobs first album is definitely not their best. While the vocal harmonies are there right from the beginning, they still hadn't really developed as songwriters. While there are a few good original songs here, most of them are pretty forgettable. Which would explain why the Bobs almost never perform any of the songs from this album anymore, with the exception of their cover version of the Beatles' ""Helter Skelter"". That classic song is the highlight of the album, along with their cover of the Talking Heads' ""Psycho Killer"". The Bobs would go on to have much better original songs, starting with their second album (My, I'm Large). I would recommend getting that album before you get this one."
2,Not that bad,"The bobs' first album is not that good either. There is a definite lack of maturity in the choice of songs, as most of them are boring and without any real interest.However, the ""Psycho Killer"" (last track) cover is flawless and shows how this great acapella group earns its keep - fantastic harmonics, great rhythm and awesome lead singer. I recommend this album just for this song alone."
2,not so good book,It needs real pictures of the plants not drawings. someone could eat the wrong things with out proper photos to id the plants also there are a hell of a lot more edible plants than these.
2,I did not like this at all,"I generally enjoy Mercedes Lackey books, what with them being the most abundant set in my bookcases, but I was sorely disappointed with this. It just was not up to my expectation of excellence for this writer. The only story I specifically remember that I like whas something about a priest who lived off somewhere by himself and one of the giant cats from the Karse sungod thing... if you have read the books, you know what kind of cat I mean, I just can't think of it. I also can't think of the name of the stories because I barely made it through by skimming to see if there were any I wanted to read after reading a couple. I didn't see this as a good investment other than completing the collection, and if you aren't a book collector, I recommend checking this out at a library or going to a used bookstore or borrowing from a friend. It's not worth the money. There are worse books, but this was far below my level of expectation."
2,Hit and Miss,"I quite enjoy most of Lackey's work - it's entertaining, engaging light reading, with a well thought out world and sympathetic characters. Not great literature, but a really good read.That said, I have not been impressed with her forays into editing. Sun in Glory suffers from the same faults as its precurser, Sword of Ice. There are a couple of decent stories, notably Nancy Asire and Tanya Huff's entries, which provide interesting forays into Valdemar. Most of the rest read as if they were fan-fiction. Not truly terrible, but unsatisfying and unable to stand on their own as good stories.My advice - go off and pick up a copy of Magic's Pawn or Arrows of the Queen, or Oathblood for some *good* Valdemaran short stories. Give this book a miss, unless you are intent on completing the series."
2,The sun should set on this one...,"I normally enjoy most of Mercedes Lackey's work. I picked this up, and was expecting good things. The Valdemar world is fairly structured and stable. I barely made it through the first story before I put the book on my ""to give away... QUICKLY"" shelf. One of the other stories wasn't too bad, although it wasn't memorable enough for me to remember its title (it would be the one about the priest and his suncat).I think this is probably the worst book with Ms. Lackey's name on it since she changed the complete history of Skif in 'Take a Thief'. If you must read this, get it from the library. Its not worth owning."
3,Not the best in the series,"I mainly purchased this book as it was the one anthology from the series I had not yet read. I knew the reviews were mixed but I still wished to read it cover to cover. I have to say that the first story written by the 12 year old fan didn't really engage me. It was good for her age, and I can understand why Ms. Lackey would include a piece of what is likely untold thousands of fan submissions. Still, it would have been better served if it had been published in an anthology specifically devoted to fan work.The remainder of the stories were hit and miss, though it was a pleasurable way to pass the afternoon. I look forward to the next anthology for this series."
2,Disappointing,"This three CD set has many songs that are difficult to find in a compilation from the 70s. That's precisely why I ordered it. Unfortunately, this set is advertised as ""original artists"" but sounds like remakes in virtually every situation. At a minimum the recordings sound like they are at 78 rpm rather than the original 45 rpm that I first remember hearing them. The original integrity of the songs does not seem intact here. I was disappointed and wouldn't suggest buying, unless you don't care about how closely this approximates the original."
1,Sensational 70's Various Artists,"What a disappointment! The cuts here are not the original cuts. These songs are cheap imitations, so bad I couldn't tell for sure if even the artists weren't imposters. Stick to buying the real thing unless you are willing to settle for less."
5,Sensational Box Set,"This Box Set has to be the greatest collection of rock/pop songs from the sensational 70's. With bands like Boston, Cheap Trick, and Santana it makes a great gift for any fan of 70's rock. I loved this box set and I hope you will too."
2,"Weak overall, but has its moments","A number of songs are just plain generic, but a few catchy tunes like ""Dirty Old Town"" and ""Rock and Roll Fever"" may make this one worth getting for fans of ELO Part 2.""Beyond the Dream"" and ""Sea of Dreams"" come across as experimental cuts and frankly, I wish this was the direction Kelly Groucutt and Mik Kaminski had stuck with, instead of playing it safe with standardized pop. But I'll take what I can get."
2,OH WHAT A DIFFERENCE ONE PERSON CAN MAKE,"I'm not going to waste much time with this review and I think I can sum it all up with this ""It is obvious Jeff Lynne made these guys what they WERE"". Without Lynne.......Ahem....NOT GOOD!"
1,Crap. Do not recommend.,"This was a total waste of money. The plastic pieces are flimsy, hard to position, and not flexible enough of a ""goose neck"" that you can adjust your drill press table height without doing major adjustments to this as well.Mine will ultimately end up in the garbage."
4,Unique Education,"This book, as is snowflakes, is very unique. Illustrations are fantastic and tell a story of their own!"
3,Not what it could be!,"I won't presume to be critical of such a great copywriter as the author. But my reason for giving the book only 3 stars instead of five is because the entire book could have been so much more.The latter half of the book are ""100 ways to start a sales letter"". It ought to be a gold mine. It IS of value, but again, in nearly all of the illustrated ""ways"", Lewis illustrates how people foul them up; not in how they are used successfully.The same is true for the first part of the book. He helpfully offers actual samples of sales letters that he has received but spends most of his time mocking them and showing what's wrong. Certainly many of them deserve criticism but I wonder how much better the book would have been if Lewis had given examples of GOOD copy.I recommend the book. I was just disappointed that it continually focused on the negative instead of helping the reader with GOOD copy."
2,Speak English Herschell...,"I agree with Rush.This book does have a very useful list of headlines, opening sentences, and a knowledgeable section on envelope copy with illustrations.....but the guy explains these things in such a bizarre vernacular and egotistical vibe that it was hard for me to feel any sort of enthusiasm as I was learning (or trying to). Maybe Lewis should've been a politician.If you want a sales letter book, I fully recommend Dan Kennedy's 'The Ultimate Sales Letter'. It's step by step, easily understandable, fun to read and teaches you everything Lewis does but much more. Your excitement will skyrocket. Kennedy's your Man."
4,Ball Home Canning Utensil Set,"These utensils are so durable and useful. We have two sets of them, one for my husband and myself. He enjoys canning right along side of me. We enjoy canning what we grow and enjoy eating it even more."
5,Works great.,"The cable splits the channels perfectly. I haven't noticed any loss of quality from the cables, and they seem to be built sturdily. I bought them so that I could get true stereo sound off of a set of two portable speakers. I plug the male end into the audio source, and the two speakers into each female end, the black is the left channel (conducted through the tip of a TRS jack), the red is right channel (conducted through the ring of a TRS jack.) Previously to buying this one, I bought a little jack from Radio Shack that was supposed to do the same thing, but for some odd reason it's manufactured with the ground in the wrong spot (on the ring, or the tip, instead of the sleeve I think?) and the consequences were that it only worked with non powered devices plugged in (such as headphones) but didn't work with amplified or powered devices (such as rechargeable portable speakers.) But anyways, this item is doing what the Radio Shack item couldn't."
3,works ok.,"used to feed an stereo in my backyard, connect it to the ipod and its working, it is outside so i hope the rain does not kill it. so far is ok."
1,even if you are a die hard fan this is hard to watch,While the book this was based on (Charlie's Angels Casebook) had some great insight on one of my all time favorite shows - the movie version does little to shed any real light on the coming and going of the Angels. The recreation of David Doyles Bosley is a travesty and a true disservice to his memory. Kate Jackson (although the most convincing played by any of the actresses)is a beer bottle guzzling hard ass. No wonder Kate posted on her own website asking people to NOT watch this film when it originally aired on television. Farrah was so upset by the movie and all of the presumptions made of her life at the time that she refuses to even discuss the film. While all of these behind the scenes films are geared toward the lowest common denominator - This one reaches to the very bottom of the trash heap to entertain(?)
3,This should have been a two part mini series or something.,"This movie mainly focuses on the controversy about Farrah Fawcette decision to leave the show after the first season, her relationship with actor Lee Majors and the court battle with Producer Aarron Spelling.To me, this T.V. movie about the show, should have been made into a two part series. From what I have read over the years about the show, the real ""drama"" began during the start of the second season and it is now known that, Kate Jackson and Cheryl Ladd did not get along at all. Not only that, but also Ms. Jackson's feud with both Aarron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg.Also, it would have been more interesting if, the movie went more indepth about the other stars personal lives and how the show was affecting their relationships as well. People don't realize, but during Charlies Angels run, Kate Jackson, Jacklyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd all got divorces from their spouses."
5,SURPRISINGLY ENTERTAINING! WORTH WATCHING!,"I WAS HESITANT ABOUT PURCHASING THIS DVD WITH IT BEING AN ""UNAUTHORIZIED"" VERSION OF THE STORY, BUT ONCE I WATCHED IT I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED! VERY GREATLY DONE! I LOVE THE CHOICE OF ACTRESSES WHO PORTRAYED THE ANGELS, AND AARON SPELLING. THERE WAS NOTHING VULGAR OR MIS LEADING ABOUT THIS DOCUMENTATION AT ALL. IT WAS DONE VERY VERY TASTEFULLY! EVEN WITH ALL OF THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING FARRAH FAWSETT LEAVING THE SHOW AFTER SEASON 1.. IT WAS NOT PORTRAYED NEARLY AS BAD AS I REMEMBER HEARING BACK THEN. THIS IS WAS A VERY CLEVER WAY OF SHOWING US CHARLIE'S ANGELS FANS A BEHIND THE LOOK AT WHAT IT WAS LIKE BACK THEN FOR THE ANGELS, AND THE CREW & MANAGERS. I LOVED THIS LITTLE FILM. BRILLIANT!!!"
3,CA FAN,"The actresses were very believable, but to true C.A. Fans, it was a bit disappointing. Should not have ""gone there""."
5,If you enjoyed the Carreras recording (and I did) ...,"... try Traditional Catalan Songs, sung by Victoria de los Angeles (Catalan name: Victoria dels Angels),Original Release Date: January 1, 1992Number of Discs: 1Label: Collins ClassicsASIN: B0000268LB"
1,Piece of Junk,"This toy is sad, breaks easily, jacket made from solid plastic making it fall over easily, the moveable part are junk, price? To expensive for the quality. Looks fake overall due to the poor painting job. Easily smaller than 6 inches. My advice, buy the devil may cry 4 Dante from square enix rather than this piece of junk."
5,must have,"If your a devil may cry fan this is the action figure for you. It comes with all dante's wepons twin pistols Ebony and Ivoy,sword Rebellion, guitar Nevan and cut off double-barrel shot gun. It also has a second head. You can put him in about any pose know to man and some only know to rats. All in all its a great figure."
3,Some good some bad,First of all the song list is the same for every concert and that sucks. The Tim Owen concert is just horrid. He can't sing for crap glad I never went to watch him. I don't know if it was the recording or not but it just sounded plain bad. This should have been one disk with two concerts and half the price. Also the crowd was so crazy muted you can't even hear anything when they sing a part. I mean not a sound.
1,Made where ??,"Looking for boots that are made in America. The description does not mention that these are made in China ! I'm glad that a reviewer mentioned this fact before I bought a pair and had to return it. Very sleazy not to mention this, most people think Harley Davidson products are made in USA when most harley products are made in China !"
3,Boot guy,The boots are nice but require a bit of wearing-in. They first turned my socks dark at the ankle area due to the leather. I guess thats expected. They also hurt my ankle a bit. Maybe I tied them too tight. Dont know. They are however very pleasant to the view just not as comfortable as expected. I guess comfort should not be an issue if your a hardcore Harley rider.
3,Good boot,"Good boot for the money. solid matterial and construction. comfort is medium-well. very disappointed in ""made in china"" origin of manufacturing."
5,You have to like them,I got this album for a present last year. I would say if you like E.L.O. your love this one.
5,this game is very good there are limitless stufff u are able to do i say buy this one its aswome,very great game there are tons of unlockable and many many hour of game play to keep u busy for a while.
3,its an ok game,"this game isnt bad but its not what a lot of people made it out to be. the graphics arent great, they arent even ""good"" considering that its an xbox game (only a little better than dreamcast in my opinion). that doesnt take away from gameplay though, the controls are clean and its pretty easy to play. except for the constant system crashes its a game worth buying expecially considering the price."
3,THESE ARE STEREO > DUAL MONO OUTPUT!,"If your looking for a headphone splitter, this is NOT the device you want. The item takes a stereo signal (Left & Right) and converts it to single split mono channels. Meaning you only get 1 ear in each pair of headphones. Make sure you buy Stereo to Stereo output splitter if that is your desired use.However, this is a great device for plugging in 2 guitars to one amplifier! So I guess it has a use!"
1,Need more info,Tell us in the product description whether it is a mono to L/R or a mono split or a mono to R/R or a mono to L/L.Seriously.Or provide a wiring diagram and let those of us who care figure it out for ourselves.I should not need to rely on a reviewer for that info.
3,"How can I exchange item for you, Hosa?","This item is new return, it is not suitable for me,I need item like, ""2 Headphone Splitter"" Sharing on the computer.How can I contact Hosa?"
4,not bad at all for the price,"This cable seems to be made semi cheaply, but that's not unexpected considering the price. I haven't had it very long, but it seems that it will hold up for a decent period of time. Does exactly what it needs to do without issues,"
3,works fine but not as sturdy as expected,"I would like to expand my mic input to 2 mic inputs. some people reviewed it as a sturdy product. I ordered two units, and received right away. One of them worked pretty well. Another one seemed having connection issues. one of the mic interrupted from time to time. Checked Mic was working fine since another unit worked very well and mic worked fine w/o the this unit as well.I am kind of disappointed but at least one worked. Since it is cheap so just tossed the defect unit into trash can. I gave 3 stars since only one works."
5,good deal,"uh... um.... uh... oh yeah... this plug makes it possible to plug two guitars into a single jack on an amp.... nice if your amp has just one jack and you want to play a duo w/ a friend.... works well, no prob."
5,great product,"this is somehow a rather rare product, but they carry it. great product, fast shipping, A+"
3,Works,Note- this product is mono not stereo. You will not get sound on left and right. I did not notice this before I purchaced it. It does work fine but I am using this for music and you need stereo so why bother.
1,Waste of Money,This toy is not worth the plastic it's made out of...The battery pack does get very hot very quicly and what you can't really tell by the picture is there is a seam right in the middle of both eggs big enough to fit a fingernail in and it snags in places you don't want it to snag....awful product don't waste your money.
1,Defective Product,I ordered this product and the first time I used it the control for it burnt my skin. The batteries get way too hot! I recommend staying away from this on.
1,ok,"i bought this product because i wanted a kit and thats what it showed and said but when shipped only bag wow!, repoff"
5,Great DVD,This is one of the few DVDs that specifically speaks to the woman athlete. It is packed full of different exercises and guidelines for creating my own specific program. No it is not your typical workout DVD where the Richard Simmons like instructor does twenty lunges and cheers you along.This DVD shows you the form of the best excersises done by serious women endurance athletes. I am a much stronger athlete since using the exercises taught on this DVD.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"If you are an endurance athlete like myself (I run ultra-marathons), then the information presented is not new. I actually purchased this DVD thinking that it was more of a workout DVD, which I could use to augment my current training program. But instead it's just a workout tutorial. (ie: How to do a squat..) It's very very basic information.. Most endurance athletes I know already have this information in their repetoire. So save your $$$. (I wanted to give it 0 stars, but it wouldn't let me.)"
1,Programmers and PHD's only,"For me (non-engineer, support staff) this book was a complete waste of time. Since it was highly recommended to me by an engineer who is very knowledgeable in IP telephony, I assume that for others it can be useful. I suspect those others either should be very experienced engineers or should have PHD's in both mathmatics and IP telephony. It most definitely is not an introductory-level book."
3,routing,what actually is dealt on trunk reource management of ip telephony. what numbering plan is used here
3,Paul Simon liked it enough,"Those with eclectic musical tastes and an appreciation for old and new may recognize the melody in track # 3, ""Mein Gmuth ist mir verwirret,"" composed by Hans Hassler. Later reworked by Johann Sebastian Bach as his chorale from ""St Matthew Passion"", it was again reworked by Paul Simon in the song ""American Tune"", released on his 1973 album ""There Goes Rhymin' Simon."" Simon gives Bach (not Hassler) credit for the music."
1,Billy Bury???RERECORDINGS,"THIS ALBUM CONTAINS 20 OF BILLY FURY'S RERECORDINGS OF HIS HITS THE LABEL DOES NOT MENTION THIS AND WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY NOW I HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER FURY COMP WITH THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS ON IT......TRY TO FIND 40TH ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION,LOVE SONGS OR ROCKIN AND BOPPIN BUT NOT THIS RIP OFF FROM KTEL"
2,"Good value, but doesn't work very well","I bought this to carry in my messenger bag so I could use it at worked, when needed. While it worked the first couple of times, it has started to be a pain. When I try to charge it I have to wiggle the connection and then place the phone in odd positions so it will stay connected to charge. After several hours of charging, the phone still wasn't fully charged. I know it's not my phone because my home charger does exactly what it is supposed to do."
3,Love Tony Benett,"I grew up on this music, so it brings back many memories. Only drawback was that some of the quality of the songs was lacking."
4,Very cute!,"Perfect seller! - Adorable toy for kids (in perfect condition!) - and price - much ""cheaper"" amd shiiping cost too - from other stores and ebay. If you want/like this toy - I would recommend this seller to you."
5,best stuffed animal ever!,"awesome quality with official square enix tags still attached and still wrapped in plastic. great for anyone who is an avid fan of the final fantasy series. great for children too, as there are no small pieces to choke on and is very soft. recommended for all."
3,Textbook what should be read once every 10 years,"History textbooks should be re-read every 10 years. In 1929 no one from League nation believed in next war. They spoke ,they said that if it would happened it would be end western civilisation. In 1970 many accepted communism or USSR as partner in world dialogue of nothing. Now one has to ask what Those from next want to suggest as Historic reading?"
3,Flash back,"A re-make of the 80's arcade classic, Gauntlet Legends lets many of us relive our youth, with the days we spent pouring our hard earned allowance into a machine at the local arcade. Gauntlet Legends contains mostly monotonous hack and slash game play. It consists of little more then mashing the attack button and collecting gold. At first the graphics might catch your eye, and the chance to relive the days of old, but soon after you will tire of this game. It is a renter at best which is always better played with a friend then solo."
5,Gauntlet,I mainly bought this game for my kids and I. I liked the product I received and have enjoyed playing the game.
3,Good Game,Came quickly and in excellent condition. Game is fun with other people but somewhat repetitious with antiquated graphics. I am very satisfied.
3,Very fun as a multi-player!,"The stroy-line isn't very good, but It is a great game for people who like to kill evil beasts or if you have lot's of people in the house!A great multi-player game for sure!Just don't buy it unless you like LOTS of killing and/or multi-player games!It DOES take up loads of memory space, though..."
3,"A Legend, NOT!","It's a shooter, you run around through a maze shooting. You find occasional powerups, and you shoot. You go into different levels and worlds and shoot. Not much skill involved. All you need is 2 thumbs/controller/half a brain and shoot! I guess shooters are just not my BAG! Graphics and gameplay are good. Didn't play it long enough to actually find the plot (2 weeks or so, surprised even that long) Shooters just isn't my favorite genre, and my review may in someway be biased. If your into shooters, then its your call, but as for my personal opinion, this game is ok. Maybe a little fun with multiplayers, but replay value=( Try to find it used, or wait for the price to go down. This game get's 3 stars: Grade: C. Gamer247 is OUT! GAME ON!"
4,"Pirates,Dames At Sea and a rare monster or Two !","PIRATES OF TREASURE ISLANDStarring: Lance Henricksen, Tom Nagel and Rebekah Kochan.Long John Silver has some treasure, Not his, and he has to hide it and get it at a later date. That's the plot, Now executed by Lance Henricksen and Theasylum regulars. The cast stood out with great accents and commitment. Tom Nagel had the thankless role as the hero. Rebekah Kochan looked the best I've seen her, She can fight too-Sometimes just with her blouse .Lance Henricksen seems an odd choice for LJS(What a tasty franchise),But he was great and so into Villian-mode. Okay, final score,The ship looked great, Island scenes rocked and The occasional creature was welcome."
5,"Amazing, amazing, amazing","Like the previous reviewer, I love my Justin boots. Not just gorgeous but comfy like slippers. NO wearing-in required, they're comfy-cozy right from first minute you wear them with a cushioned foot bed that reminds my of a running shoe. I wish I could wear them to bed. :-)"
3,Not to be taken TOO seriously....,"Anyone who does a cover of Modern English's ""I Melt With You"" and Killing Joke's ""Psyche"" in a languid stylee gets my vote."
3,Decent but nothing extraordinary,"The general idea - let's take songs of some specific genre (hard rock, reggae, punk, disco) and redo them in absolutely different way (remember Pat Boone singing metal?) - was used so many times that it is not funny anymore. Still this rates as a rather enjoyable attempt although I can understand old punksters and new-wavers having heartattacks at the sacrilege. Put it on as a background and don't take it too seriously, then you'll get some kicks out of it. ""Guns of Brixton"" is pretty cool, ""Marian"" and ""Love Will Tear Us Part"" are very listenable. I could give this a 2 stars rating but I must confess that I liked the overall ambience so here..."
1,"Now kids, can you tell me what sacrilege means","This is horrible. Absolutely f***ing horrible. Take post-punk/synth pop classics and put them through a shredder/blender of bossanova and 60s pop and what have you got? A total mess. Currently being hyped as an "" album that would melt any cold post punk's heart."" Which is complete rubbish. This is sacrilege of the highest degree. Now if people get into Joy Division and Depeche Mode because of this - that's all very well and I welcome anyone on board. But please, this CD is an insult to those classics. Some may see it as a good idea ( and I admit it does have a good nice novelty factor ) but when you strip away the novelty factor what you have is a very shallow record devoid of the emotion that was put into the original recordings ( OK I'll be the first one to admit that there's not much emotion in DM's happy-clappy Just Can't Get Enough ).Call me a musical purist if you will but some things should never be tampered with"
1,disband this band,this band needs to be disbanded. They turned Love will tear us apart into an inspipid pop tune. such a blasphemy of one of the all time great song.
4,Punk and new wave meets acoustic guitar,"This album is one of the most ingenious things I have ever heard: covering songs like ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" and ""I Melt With You,"" among other songs, with acoustic guitars, synths and jazzy drums, making the album more suitable for easy listening than rocking out. All the vocals are good, but some are weak, such as Camille's vocal on ""Too Drunk to $%*#"" (listening to the squealing on that song is very painful). Overall I recommend this album to people that usually like their music eclectic and their electronica downtempo."
1,product not delivered,"Ordered the Boston Acoustics E100 speaker advertised on Amazon via Electronics Expo. Upon placing the order and talking with customer service, I was told the product was in the warehouse and to expect delivery by 29/30 Dec, but product never arrived. I called customer service at least 4 times after to get the disposition of the order and was promised a call back each time, which never happened. Finally got an email notice that the order had been cancelled with no explanation as to why. Even a final call to customer service to get clarification resulted with ""I don't know why the order was cancelled but will find out and call you back within 30 minutes""... of course, 2 weeks later, there still has been no call back. I'm totally mystified by this lack of customer service; very unacceptable."
5,"Great, but obscure live album of blues jazz funk.","This is a live recording made in Portland, Oregon. Features Bernard Purdie on drums and a bunch of players who are not as famous, but excellent players. The album includes some songs with strong vocals and some that are instrumental. A very nice variety if you like blues with a funky feel. Excellent guitar work, harmonica, horns, vocals, keyboard, all moved along by Purdie's exact and innovative drumming. The players really work off each other and seem to be having a great time. One of my favorite live albums of all time. Should be listened to my more people. Love it. I found it quite by accident, looking for a version of Kidney Stew Blues, then ended up buying the album for myself, and another copy for a friend."
4,Master of Rhythm,"I saw Bernard 'Pretty' Purdie playing with Dr John's band at Croydon Fairfield Halls in 19**. The year hasn't stuck with me but Purdie's playing has. Technically hot, effortless energy and with a really great feel. This album captures what sound like a really fun evening. Wish I'd been there."
3,So so,"This book was great for outlining policies and regulations, but was a bit dry. Got distracted easily while reading it..."
2,Good stories but so-so adaptations,"So very sorry to say this but these adaptations were at best, okay. Knowing these stories as well as I do-- I think the author could trust kids and teachers more."
3,Reader's Theater,I wanted plays that were interesting and could be used with 5th graders. Some of the plays were bland and of no interest.
5,Nice Item,I use this with a PDA and laptop. Works as advertised and is really the only solution for a mouse on a PDA.
2,Dissappointed Too,Dissappointed in the performance of the mouse. It doesn't track my hand movements well - hesitates. I too read all the positive reviews. I wonder if they were sent in by employees. Smart marketing. Good concept. Has a ways to go.
1,Does NOT Work for SmartPhones!,"Amazon's product description claims the iGO MSBTUE Stowaway Bluetooth Mouse ""works with smartphones""--that is false!I could not get this bluetooth mouse to connect to--pair with--my Motorola Atrix, Motorola Xoom, or Samsung Galaxy. I have successfully connected many different types of bluetooth enabled devices to both smartphones and Android tablet. But this mouse is the only bluetooth device that ever failed to connect.Think twice about buying this mouse for your smartphone or Andriod tablet."
2,Wonderful little mouse...Until it exploded under my hand!,"I bought this mouse for my Gateway laptop and absolutely loved working with it. I upgraded to Windows Vista and did have trouble getting the laptop to discover the mouse. Finally got all that worked out, then one evening I had my hand on the mouse when there was a very loud pop and my hand buzzed. After poking at it for a while, I removed the batteries and one of the inside of the mouse was black! The batteries seemed to be intact so I assume it was the mouse itself that exploded. I loved the mouse but I'm not sure I will buy another one!"
1,Absolute Powerhog,"I am using it with a Macbook Pro, had no problems to connect it but the red light is constantly blinking and it eats through batteries as there was no tomorrow. I certainly would not buy it again and cannot recommend it ( mind you I have a ThinkOutside Bluetooth keyboard and I am very happy with it). On average new batteries last four days!!"
3,Slick Design + Battery Killer,"I love the small, slick design. It travels well, but beware it goes through regular AAA batteries about every 3 weeks if used for 5 day, 8 hours per day work week. I use rechargeables now. I would test out other products too, maybe the Logitech one. The bluetooth also goes out sometimes and doesn't connect right away, kind of buggy if you ask me. I'm an electronics power user and this is a ""would have reviewed others"" first."
1,Warning! Batteries die quickly!!,"I've had it for one week only and I'm using 3rd pair of Duracell batteries right now! I was using it for 3-4 hours per day (I have another mouse at work). Stayed switched off for the rest of the day in order to save batteries. Nice mouse when it works.. Mine is piece of junk, maybe the latest batch they've got was not up to standard. So I totally agree with Mr. Loftin.. And it's silver one in my case, not a black one I've ordered..."
5,Very Nice,"I took the advice of all who wrote reviews here on this mouse and purchased it for my Dell notebook. It is exactly what I was searching for - tiny, simple, bluetooth wireless, and attractive with a comfortable fit. But, as a precaution, when I ordered, I expected to receive the rubber-coated black mouse everyone admired. Instead, I received a regular plastic silver version that I had not seen pictured before. Awesome mouse for notebook computers!"
2,Terrible battery life - stay away!,"Looks cute, but perfomance is average. The movement doesn't feel very precise, I always feel like I need to correct for movement errors (on lacquered oak table surface). But the biggest disappointment is that it eats batteries like there is no tomorrow. I have to change batteries every 5-6 days after moderate evening use. Less than a week for a set to drain out!The automatic power off doesn't help much.Addition after couple of months: I thought the mouse was bad and had it replaced by ThinkOutside. Same story. So eating up the batteris is a desigh flaw."
3,Packaging is horrible,I really cannot comment on the mouse. I have not had it long enough yet. However the packaging is from h*ll. It took me a 15 minutes just to get the mouse out of the clam shell plastic and I gave up trying to get batteries house.LJK
2,Try one of his newer titles,"After being mildly entertained by Lupica's novel Bump and Run, I decided to read his first novel, Jump. I was very disappointed. It is a very poorly written book with week characters, a shakey plot at best, and terrible dialogue. This was his first novel and he did seem to get better with Bump and Run, so I will probably take a look at his future offerings. I suggest skipping this one and picking up one of his newer books."
1,I read more of it than I wanted,"Dialogue is jumpy.....story is old....everything in the world revolves around New York to him, no wonder he doesn't actually watch games that he comments on. Thought he would be much better....very disappointed."
3,depressing NBA/Crime novel,"It is an interesting story, the problem is that it's too much like reading the sports section in the newspaper these days. When I pick up the sports section I like to read about sports, but it's sometimes hard to find in all of the financial and crime news. If you like Mike Lupica, you'll probably enjoy this book, but if you want to read a much better Lupica novel, try to get your hands on the Peter Finley novels (Extra Credits, Limited Partner and Dead Air)."
1,won't buy it,as a buyer you have not given any info on this disc. What songs are onit? who is the manufacturer? don't expect to sell it if we don't know what's on it duh!
4,Easy to read 2 pages a day !,"Schaum's easy outline for Spanish grammar has only ONE objective : to get the grade , that is to pass the course.It does not purport to get you to speak or to write in Spanish ; only to pass the exam , to get the grade.With 126 pages of text,exercises solved,verb charts, a student can easily complete the study of the book on a basis of 2 pages a day; an ambitious student or one short of time can complete it on a basis of 4 pages a day in ONE month.Yes, if you are short of time and need to pass your Spanish grammar test, this book will help you pass it.Go for it."
5,A MUST READ FOR THE HORROR FAN! NOT FOR THE WEAK OF STOMACHE,"A VERY FAST PACE BOOK, IF YOU LOVE TO BE SCARED BY YOUR IMAGANATION THAN YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK. THIS WILL TURN YOUR STOMACHE BUT WILL LEAVE YOU WANTING TO READ IT AGAIN AND AGAIN TO SEE IF YOU MISSED ANYTHING."
4,Total mind trip,"This story really messed me up in the head. All the weird flashbacks and the asylum, it's easy to get lost in this one. Really vivid material."
1,No. Just....no.,"Not only is this clearly designed to make children into sheep, it assumes that every child is a mentally handicapped zombie. The only people who will find this informative are Christians (and that's insulting most Christians, who shouldn't be lumped into such a sad group). Impressively unfunny, other than the humor derived from laughing at the pathetic excuse for a production this video is (much like The Room). It saddens me people attempt to enlist children in their cause in such blatant and disturbing ways. Also, the racism is atrocious. Seriously, the New York Jew is the computer of the devil. Good one, guys.This just defies description."
4,It is what it is,"This is what it is... A super cheap mono Y-cable. It should be sufficient for many needs and is cheap enough that thin wire gauge and such can be forgiven. Just be aware that it is cheap and unshielded, etc.For the price and intent, I almost gave it 5 stars. But it's not a 5-star cable... It's a fair quality ultra cheap cable. 4 stars seems about right."
3,ok but not great,"The female connection is a little loose, causing crackling or drop outs. You have to twist and wiggle until you hit the sweet spot. annoying."
4,Good Quality,"No flaws. What you see is what you get! I use this to hook my PC into my powered studio monitorsHas dedicated LEFT and RIGHT output, 1/4 inch"
3,Fishkeepers Guide to African Cichlids,"This was good book for someone buying their first Cichlid (Like me). However I very quickly wanted to know more! The book is great for setting up the tank and gives nice reviews of some species. I think it is a good first book, I found it very helpful, but it is not for experienced cichlid breeders."
2,Not what I had hoped for,"This book was very samll (116 pages) and was not what I had hoped for. I am a new cichlid owner and this is not the first book I bought. I already had my tank and my starter fish. I wanted some information that was not in your average ""dummies book"" which I had already read. What I got was some new information, but for the most part, it was just a review book.Also, I wanted an idea for some more fish to buy. This book has profiles of 40 cichlids, which sounds like a lot. However, when you take into account the size you want (in my case 4 or 5 inches) and the disposition of the fish (a lot of reviewed fish would not do well in a community species tank), you end up with just a small number of fish you would even want.In conclusion, it was an informative introductory book, but I wish I would have spent a few more dollars and gotten a more complete species guide."
5,Hempz is the best!,"There is NO lotion on the market (in my opinion) that smells so good, is so thick and works wonders at this lotion. I have purchased tons of it and have given it to my mother and mother-in-law for birthday gifts. Make sure that you get the Moisturizer in Hempz... the other two do not smell the same and I don't think that they smell as good. They are also not as thick and creamy as the moisturizer."
5,Best. Lotion. Ever.,"Great price, fantastic product. Bottles up and gave as stocking stuffers to everyone on my list this Christmas. The original formula (without any scent) is the best, and leaves hands and skin feeling soft and moisturized. Get this lotion and it will be the last you ever buy."
5,great product,"Can't believe I was paying over $20 per small bottle at tanning salon for 2 years. The gallon lasts me almost a year for whole body. Everyone loves the strawberry smell. I haven't found anything that compares.....good aroma, does not cause me to get acne like most others do, and moisturizes ok for body and face, and is totally non-greasy."
1,GALLERY,THIS BOOK IS NOTHING BUT PICTURES. VERY UPSET WHEN RECIEVED BOOK.WOULD NOT RECCOMEND TO ANYONE
5,One of the best!,"Germs Make Me Sick by Melvin Berger is one of the best books I've seen to educate primary grade children about viruses and bacteria and how they can make you sick -- and how you can make yourself well again. Sometimes, your Doctor will have to send a swab or a drop of your blood to a lab to see just the right way to make you well if your illness is caused by a bacteria or protect you from some diseases caused by a virus.I am amazed at how well this scientific information is presented for young readers, and the follow-up with a section on The Rules for Good Health make this a must buy for parents."
3,Germs Make Me Sick,"This is a good children friendly teaching book that shows kids what they should and should not do when it comes to staying away from germs. Very creative and attractive illustrations that peak a child's interest. The book actually contains facts that even adults should know and practice. This is a good, fun, science, math and health book all in one.Jennifer Dunagan,authorof Auntie Jennie's Puppy Series:The Adventures of Santana andSantana's Harrowing Halloween"
4,"An untimidating, practical account of germs for young reader","My three-year old son really enjoys this book. The book's fairly simple, yet informative account of how viruses and bacteria can make us sick helps to make the abstract concept of germs more concrete for him. As an added bonus, the book gives a plug for handwashing, covering mouths when sneezing or coughing, and not sharing cups that most preschoolers can benefit from. I must also confess that, despite having read the Times Science section for years, I learned quite a bit about viruses and bacteria from this simple, well-illustrated book. A good buy, especially for parents who field a lot of factual queries every day. The Let's Read and Find Out series is a great way to let someone else do the explaining for a change."
3,A missed opportunity to teach about hygiene,"Although this book is thorough in describing the differences between viruses and bacteria, I think it misses an important opportunity to reinforce hygiene...wash your hands, cover your mouth etc. These are given a cursory review on the last page, with no accompanying illustration. I had hoped that this book would help my almost-4-year-old to understand how people get sick, how they get well, and how they can help prevent communicable disease to reinforce what I teach at home. I do not think that the authors did a very good job of meeting those expectations."
4,"Good...but wish it had ""tips""","We really enjoy reading these book and it is full of awesome information as with all of the ""Read and Find-Out Science"" books. My only wish is that included reinforcements on HOW to help keep the germs AWAY...wash hands...cover coughs and sneezes...etc. Still a VERY good book and will open discussion on how to help keep the germs away...sometimes it is just good to hear it from someone other than your mother:) Recommended."
5,Definitely Fun For All Ages,"We originally bought this game to try to get my six year old son to PLAY a game. He loves to watch my husband play games and ""help"" him out. My husband ended up loving the game and enjoyed playing all of the different characters in the different backgrounds and levels. My son played a little and so did I. It was easy to do tricks even when you didn't know what you were doing. My son would hit buttons and whiz around for a while. Very enjoyable game and the music wasn't bad either. My husband ended up buying a CD or two from the tracks. I would recommend this for anyone who likes non-violent games and anyone who enjoys Disney characters."
4,Da Bomb,"This game is an exiting game of adventure. Some levels you work really hard for, some you don't. You can even make a skater that looks like you. Perfect for ALL ages"
5,A Must,This book takes you through the entire ministry of Smith Wigglesworth from childhood to flourishing ministry. It is a lovely book to read and to pray into your life. It is a quick glance at the man from start to finish and gives you a decent understanding of Smith Wigglesworth's ministry and life.
4,It's pretty good,"I love the fish, great in color. Also a good amount of fish to chose from. But you can only have 7 fish on the screen at a time. You can pick the fish or have it random. I love the clock/calender it's great. The back ground gets really boring after a while and I hate the fade in and out to black."
4,Great screensaver for fish lovers and keepers,"Marine Aquarium 2.5 is a great, realistic screensaver to have if your a fan of fish or you enjoy keeping them. I got this screensaver to help me coup with being away from my fish tank at home while I study at college. This purpose is ideally suited as the fish are very realistic and behave as wild fish would. I enjoy how you can optionally have daytime and nighttime light effects on the scene, or add different species of fish to the fray. One of the only things I can negatively say about this program is that only one background scene is available.With only one minor deficiency this program will keep you satisfied and relaxed for a long time."
1,Mac users may not be pleased.....BUT,"I have used Marine Aquarium in pc's foryears,it is the best aquarium screensaverI have seen or used.I ordered it for my I-MAC 24, since I knew itand has a wide screen feature.But it does not work with OS X 10.5.4 leopardInstall is fine,but when you use it,a window appears""version does not work,ask vendor for newer version""I returned it.PS Installed 2.6 for mac os 10,last night,works great,,,,Mac owners,thisis the version,you need!!"
4,Aquarium Software,Only software of this type Ive used. Has many options including transparent clock and number of fish (up to 11 I think).Great life like graphics and screen size settings.Worth the price.
5,No cleaning required!!,"We've had this on our computer for a week now and thoroughly enjoy it. We've had both a marine tank and reef tank in the past and find this very realisitic. The only improvements I'd like to see is more of a variety in the sizes of the fish to be more representative of reality and it would be wonderful if the live coral, feather dusters, etc., also moved with the current in the water."
2,It doesn't work on Mac OS X,I couldn't get it to work on my iMac or my MacBook Pro laptop. It just doesn't work on 10.5 or higher. I had to install it on my other laptop which has Windows (XP) and it worked fine. The software itself looks nice though and I just wish that I could enjoy it on my iMac. I didn't return it since it was only 5 bucks and not worth it.
1,Warning! Do not buy if you have Mac OSX Snow Leopard,"While this is currently the best looking screen saver -- Marine Aquarium is not compatible with OSX Snow Leopard. When going to them for support they basically said, ""tough luck"" and that they had ""no plans"" to do anything about this any time soon and ""no refunds"". If this is how they want to treat their customers I recommend looking for something else."
5,GREAT AND RELAXINGThe first,The first screensaver that I've found that is both relaxing in sight and sound... Are there more out there???
1,"Where are the crabs, seahorses, snails ?","This ss is kinda nice, but there is not enough variety. There should have been a lot more exotic fishes, and crustations like spider crabs, snails, starfishes, etc.There are over a thousand different animals in the ocean, but the programmers decided that it would be easiest to place only a handfull.There should also be an option that lets you ""buy"" toys to place in the aquarium. Like sunken boats and treasure chests.I hope someone makes a third version of this ss with my above recommendations."
1,NOT Mac OSX/Snow Leopard compatible,"Recommend avoiding this version. There are still many ""new"" boxes of OLD software (like produce) for sale out there. Version 2.5 should be pulled from vendors inventory and returned to the manufacturer. Lousy experience... I read the product description which said that this software was compatible with OSX 10.1.5 or higher...and thought it was going to be O.K. for my new Mac mini. The software company wants another $9.95 to ""upgrade"" this new purchase. Shame on them. Disappointed."
1,Don't bother,"I just bought this SS after seeing it live in action at the store. It looked great. Well at least at the store. I have a 3 GH CPU, 1024 of DDR RAM, and a 64 MB video card in my laptop. (The laptop is 1 month old) When it does run, it is SLOW and choppy. The bubbles suck, and the fish swim as if they are about to go belly up and end up at the top of the tank. Thankfully the store I bought it at is offering me a full return."
5,Marine Aquarium Screensaver software,Absolutely fantastic..........As good as the real aquarium that I have with the advantage that the fish never have to be fed or the system kept clean and balanced !!
3,Excellent at the price....but,"Compact and light but 27mm objectives limit useful power to around 30x, anything higher requires a tripod anyway. Still,for brilliant days it's nice to have the potential. If price is a factor this is a good choice."
2,Mediocre at best,"I went for these binocs after reading so many favorable reviews, but I would not recommend them... For these Meade's you need tremendous light and they have a narrow field of view. At the maximum zoom they are worthless and even at the minimum zoom they are marginal."
4,cheap chopper,my husband has not had time to read it very closely yet but so far seems to think it is okay
5,ii like it,"this book is what it is i have read a lot of bad reviews on this book and saw a few good ones. If u really think u can just buy one book and build a bike,tome that would be a fantasy but it is a good book to start with. i plan on getting a few more books and finding someone with some real world experience in building bikes . at least i will know what to ask and now i know where to start"
3,Want To Read A Cheap Chopper Book?,"I was looking for more of a book that compared the difference of builds using just parts for Harleys. This book even goes into metric bikes something I'm not interested in. It's more of a here's a few pics of my bike and some fundamental information you should know. Would have been better if it went through an entire build on one bike, what options there are, costs and difficulties encountered. The only thing I don't understand is the title as there is no such thing as a cheap chopper. Maybe the metric choppers is the cheap way to go. Building a Harley is no longer cheap. Buying new parts is expensive. Build a cheap chopper and I think of building it with used parts. Even buying someone's aborted build is expensive if all the parts aren't there."
4,WRONG NAME FOR THE DVD: it must be: Vladimir Jurowski and the London Philharmonic Orchestra,"This is a DVD featuring Vladimir Jurowski and The London Philharmonic in works by Wagner, Berg and Mahler."
4,guess what daddy's bringing home for supper,The second compilation to come from siccmade muzicc if you dont know about them you better learn more because they are coming up. If you are not familiar with siccmade they have the dark sound to them very original you wont hear anybody like them. With that said let me tell you the best tracks on the cd.track #3 cos track#6 doomsday productions track #10 young droop Track #12 dubb sakand the lynch track is alright too.
4,The height of the Chicago Brass!,"The Chicago Symphony has always had a great brass section, but this is the proof. Who cares if it's not musical? When the trombone section completely obliterates the rest of the orchestra during the 1812it is just glorious! And in Marche Slave when the low brass gets theCzarist National Anthem, CharlieVernon takes the Bass Trombonepart down the octave and blasts overthe tuba deep in the pedal range!Like I said, it may not be completelymusical, but it's a testament to what can be done."
1,saddest lack of responses to all emails,I canceled my order previous to my text book being sent out to me and I have been fighting ever since just to get my money refunded. Amazon is passing the buck off onto the seller which has not responded to any of my emails. Amazon is not doing anything at all to refund my money or to even contact me back to get my money back to me. They took my money out of my account imediately but does nothing to make sure that my money is returned. I work hard for my money and depend on people to be honest but not even amazon has done anything to assist me in my problem. It looks as though I am going to have to report this to BBB and the consumer protection authority. I have been a month trying to get someone to do something about this and keep getting put off. Theives.
3,Pretty cute,"This one is pretty good, my 19 month old prefers a couple of other Elmo DVD's but likes this one occasionally too"
3,Good but . . . .,The Elmo part of the video is really good and is an extended Elmo segment. The rest of the video is another group of characters that my daughter is not inerested in. She watches it but keeps asking for more Elmo. The Western Elmo part of the video is great!!!!
2,"Too many cowboys, not enough Elmo","My 13 month old daughter is possibly the world's biggest Elmo fan, so naturally we were excited to add another video to our collection. She is normally glued to the t.v. when he is on. Unfortunately this video did not keep her attention as the skits with people imbetween the bits with Elmo are just too long. I would stick to ""Best of Elmo"" or the videos with multiple topics such as ""Elmo has two Hands, Ears, and Feet"" (they are simply a collection of his shows from Sesame Street)."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN WILDER...,"Second Elmo feature is pleasant enough, but should have been much better. Many of the elements that made the earlier ST. ELMO'S FIRE such a kick are here, but unfortunately innovation and originality are not among them. One or two songs stand out, but really folks, this is just a pale shadow of the mindblowing original. The ertswhile star does contribute a commentary track, at least..."
5,God bless Elmo,These Elmo's World videos are the only ones I can sit my 17 month in front of and have some time to get other things done. He doesn't move and just watches through the whole thing.
4,Fun for all ages,"I have four sons, ages between 2 and 8 years. All four of them were riveted to this film, and have watched it a couple of times in the short time that we've had it. It's wonderful to have found a movie I can feel completely comfortable allowing my children to watch - that they actually enjoy viewing more than once."
5,horses!!,My two year old loves horses and wild wild west is his favorite movie. I also have a 4 month old who loves to watch it also. Every kid should have this movie.
5,"Wild, Wild, West is a hit!",My daughter received this for her second birthday and she loves it. Once again Elmo fans are delighted with the wonderfully animated puppets and great guest stars. The music is wonderful and the costumes are adorable. This is a great movie to add to your Elmo's World library.
3,"too long, not enough kids, not enough songs","My girls are Elmo fanatics and love the ""Favorite Songs"" DVDs. This one, though, goes on forever and doesn't show them enough of what they like most - fun songs sung by various kids plus the Sesame Street characters. Not enough other Sesame Street characters, not enough kids, not enough songs. But long nonetheless!Could have been better. Wish I had gotten another straight song DVD which is what they like best (21 months)."
2,Good but not what I expected,"I am really not a fan of science fiction, but after reading Shattered Range of Vision by Mario Watts, I had to buy this book. I wasn't really impressed with this book, but found it interesting. Especially for readers who might like a fairly good science fiction novel. Personally, I think Mario Watts should keep writing horror instead of science fiction. That way I'd buy more of his books."
5,Weird but fascinating!!!,"I love this book and the way Watts orchestrates the plot, building the suspense slowly. It is easily one of the most tantalizing books I've read this year! It takes you on an alien abduction adventure that is everything you can imagine. I like the fact that it always has you in suspense wanting to read more and is not that scary. I couldn't put it down until I read through it in two days. I'm looking forward to reading another book from this author. He's a really good story teller! I recommend this book to anyone like me who loves stories about alien abductions."
4,"Fun, considering the topic","My 6yo didn't like doing this work, most of the time. She really liked the pages that involved coloring or clowns. I think this was a fun workbook for her, considering the topic (not her favorite). Next we plan to get / do the English - Grammar & Writing book from this same series. (We homeschool.)"
1,Poorly made product,"We were looking forward to playing volleyball in the water. So we researched and bought this product.Unfortunately, it was a waste of money. The net and it's parts quickly fell apart while we were playing and were extremely difficult to put back togehter. No fun was had by anyone."
3,""""" johnny was """"","This is a good british film , likable characters . was'nt a bad rental , but only gets 3 stars from me ."
2,Don't believe the hype,"This movie got a high rating by all it's reviewers but for me I wasn't impressed I'm a fan of British gangster movies but this was lame. Wasn't sure where it was going, it had many characters different plots and some action. But still in the end and how it ended was a let down."
3,looking for info about a song!,"This cd is great if your a deep jazz fan, with tracks by Miles Davis you can't go wrong and the track of Somewhere Over the Rainbow/It's a Wonderful World is just wonderful. I was dissapointed to find that the other song during the credits (the one that sounds like the True Romance theme (probably a marimba as the main instrument) wasn't on there. If anybody knows what that song is or where I can get it, PLEASE write me, I loved it! Thanks!"
2,more on missing songs,"For all those who want the missing song that sounds like the True Love theme song, it's actually a composition by Carl Orff, part of a collection called 'Musica Poetica'. Hans Zimmer, um, 'adapted' it for True Love, and it was used in Finding Forrester, as well as in Ratcatcher, and in many, many other movies. Do check it out, it's a wonderful piece."
1,Where's the Music,"I was terribly dissapointed in this soundtrack. There was so much wonderful music in the movie, but very little of it made it to the CD. With all the great stuff that was available, it really is a shame that Sony opted to give us a CD that didn't really reflect all the variety of the movie. Next time maybe Sony should go for relevant content instead of taking the easy way out by using artists from their own stable. I know it's easier and cheaper to produce a CD this way, but it sure makes for an unremarkable experience."
2,Waste of Money,"I should have read the fine print in the ad's as this is NOT the sound track of the movie but (some) ""music from the motion picture"" - as it states on the CD box. Aside from the ""Over the Rainbow"" song by Israel K the rest of the CD is awful - unless, of course, you are a jazz fan. One track out of 13 is not a good return for my money."
1,This is not the movie soundtrack,This is an orchestral (bad) rendition of the movie soundtrack. None of the selections are the actual music from the movie.
1,What were they thinking?,"I purchased Finding Forrester and i got hugely dissapointed. I agree with the guy from lincoln city, ""over the rainbow"" is the only good track, the rest isn't even music. I don't even know if I can get rid of it on e-bay, i guess all i can do with it is scrape the ice off my wind shield. What were they thinking, the ""music"" if thats what you wan't to call it, is terrible."
5,Israel Kamakawiwo'ole,"The Finding Forrester soundtrack is enjoyable. Such as this, music in a movie can often enhance the meaning to watchers. Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's 'somewhere over the rainbow' is the perfect song for this movie and message it is trying to send. Israel's music is, in itself, is very beautiful and should be appreciated since he is know longer living. I was able to attend a tribute concert for him last summer at Waikiki Shell in Honolulu, Hawaii. He is a legend to Hawaiian music. Israel's 'somwhere over the rainbow' was preveiously release on his Facing Future cd; it is a must have."
3,Love the Hawaiian Over the Rainbow,I bought this album after seeing this wonderful film. I recently had a baby girl and she loves track #8 Over the Rainbow. It's one of my childhood favorites and I hope it becomes one of hers.The other other selections are good but a lot different from the usual Miles. They are a bit dark.Enjoy!
3,the missing song,"the missing song, Over The Rainbow/Wonderful World ,is by Isreal Kamakawiwo'ole-check out his other music"
5,Works awesomely!,"I bought this for a Huntington 54 piano, which for some reason has left and right audio output. It works very well and fits snugly. It will transmit all sound, good or bad, so chances are if you hear any hissing or crackling it is either your headphones or the item you are plugging this into."
1,Looks Nice From The Picture BUT Wait Until You Get It,"I saw this roadside tool set & loved it because it was PINK and it had everything that you would need if you broke down. I really liked the little vacuum too. BEWARE!!!! The vacuum plugs into your cigarette lighter BUT the cord to the vacuum doesn't even reach all the way to my passenger's seat. That's not even the worst part about the vacuum, THE VACUUM DOESN'T SUCK UP ANYTHING & I MEAN ANYTHING!! Ooh and the flashlight, don't count on that either. I picked it up to take it out of the bag, the whole thing fell apart as I was picking it up. After that, that's when I closed the bag and walked away if you get what I'm saying. I have no idea about the rest of the stuff in the bag. I haven't opened it again since that day. I paid A LOT of money for it to be more like a child's pretend roadside tool set. If I could give this NO STARS I would!"
5,Apollo tools and roadside kit,"I am very excited that I purchased these. Now I am prepared if anything happens while I'm driving. I love that it is all pink because I am single and the quality is good. They have a good variety of tools and other things needed in the car. My brother was proud of me for buying something ""wise"" since I travel out of town a lot."
3,Superficial: Broad not deep; also it ignores the neck,"This books covers a lot of territory but I did not find it particularly helpful. It feels like it has a lot of filler material to get it to ""book length"", without focusing in on the most useful information. Also, it completely ignores the neck, apparently assuming that all problems are lower-back problems.Save your money on Back Pain Remedies for Dummies or just check it out of the library and skim it; in my opinion it is not worth the space it takes up on my book shelf."
5,Back Pain Remedies for Dummies (A Reference for the Rest of Us!) - Good Resource,"For the most part this is a good resource for those suffering with back pain and want to be a little more knowledgeable about your misery. Simple layman terms, nice lay out as is the custom of this publisher, and excellent home resource which could help you avoid the doctors if your condition is not too sever. I also like the style that you do not have to read it from front to back. You can jump around from one subject to another without missing anything. The only word of warning, be prepared to have some medical professionals contradict the findings in the book. Medicine is not an exact science and in some cases health care professionals would prefer their patients not have too much knowledge regarding their condition. However, it is your back pain not theirs and the better you are prepared to address the problem hopefully the quicker it will go away. This book is a good place to start and well worth the money."
4,Pain free,This was an enlightening book. It's nice to know that there are doctors out there who will talk to you like people.
4,works great to clean hydration pack hose,"I've owned a hydration pack for years and the knew the hose was getting dirty. This brush, although softer than I hoped, works very well to clean out the dirt/gunk buildup inside the hose. It's not long enough to completely push through, so you'll have to go from both sides.I've only used it once, but it seems sturdy enough for repeated use over years. Hopefully the plastic cord doesn't crack/break"
4,Marina hose brush review,I was a bit skeptical about this product at first but all doubts were removed as soon as I used the brush. I cleaned out my aquarium hoses and filter head and now water is once again flowing through my system beautifully. The reason why I gave this item a 4 out of 5 was because the brush wires are wrapped around a metal head which cannot go around sharp corners. I was still able to get into every nook and cranny so I will definitely be buying another one of these in the future.
1,Wrong length listed in description,"The description on the Amazon page says 6', but the package says 36"". I have to push it into both ends of the hose to make it work. A big pain. The brush itself doesn't look like much, but it works good for my Rena XP3 hoses."
5,Need some help!,"Hello customers let me tell ya a little story I always liked my SNES from DONKEY KONG COUNTRY 1, 2, and 3 I loved them so much. Now I just bought a PS2 for the first time with a cool game PITFALL: THE LOST EXPEDITION now I want more kinds of games like Pitfall, DKC and Tomb Raider but there's thousands of games from PS2 and don't know which is which so I need some help I guess I am a rookie! Thanx!!!"
2,Oh no.......,"I rented this game a couple of days ago. Right when I got inside, I put the game in. After 10 minutes, I took it out and never put it back in. This game is awfull! I like the old pitfall, but this game gets boring in like 5 minutes!!!! Trus me on this. I dont know how someone could give this 5 stars.The graphics are okay, but not anything compared to other ps2 games. The controlls get me so mad; I try to get on a rope and I keep falling, completly missing!! Sometimes it jumps, sometimes it doesnt want to.The only good thing is that you can unlock the old pitfall, ( if anyone will go through the most boring game ever, ) But I didnt get far enough cause this game is so bad.RENT FIRST!!!! Please dont spend 50 bucks on this game. I had high hopes:( :( :("
4,very adventureous,"I got this video game for my kids, aged 7, 9, 14, & 16, and they have all enjoyed playing it. My 7 year old has a harder time, but it's just because he doesn't know what to do. My 9 year old loves it, and I must say I sit and watch him and it makes me want to play. It's a great adventure game, with lots to explore, that isn't fast and it's easy to understand. You get hooked on it. I am happy that I got it, and would recommend it to others."
5,Very well rounded game with a lot of challenges,The game is excellent for the ones that like to set down every day/other day and play to the next save point. It gives challenges but it is long enough and challenging enough to not set down at one time and play the game.
5,Fair and sympathetic,"Toscanini was one of the great men, and easily the greatest conductor, of the 20th Century. Chotzinoff gives a fair and loving portrait of a man to whom he was devoted to the end. Revealing, moving and inspiring.Ralph Schoenleben"
1,Toscanini as a egomanical monster,"This book portrays Toscanini as a self centered, egomaniac. As described by Chotzinoff Toscanini off stage would be an unbearable presence. Childish, insulting, selfish and cruel are just a few words to add. An old man that demands a toy from a child. A serial adulterer who won't have anything to do with anyone who divorces. If this were truly how AT was in his last 20 years, I pity those who were around him."
4,Eye-opening Preacher,"This very enjoyable book which is also very well-written. The author allows entrance into the hidden scenes of the denominational world to give a hefty and healthy glimpse of the spiritual sicknesses that can occur in that realm we, today, call religion. Characters come alive which makes the reading of this book a ""don't put me down yet"" experience. If you have always wondered, wonder no more, as the reality of it all is there for you to see(that is, read) as Leon Stewart reveals it through the eyes of his blind, main character, Marshall Bennett."
4,Right ON,"Being in my mid sixties and having grown up in this denomination, I say""Right On"" Bishop Stewart."" Who else would have the grace of God upon them to be brave enough to reveal (most already knew - just have their heads in the sand)the truth about the leaders, their past and the headquarters dynasty. I have been involved in many areas of a local church and at the headquarters. The people Bishop Stewart wrote about thought they had the people (who they thought were stupid in the first place) fooled and if the style of living with our leaders doesn't stop with this revelation, then what will. Bishop Stewart, don't you want to tell it all and mop out our headquarters the the antiseptic of God's word, wisdom and revelation?"
3,colorful,"This book is not quite the real French Country, but more of an adaptation. It is a good reference book, though, especially alongside New French Country, my personal french country bible."
4,Who wouldn't like it if they ordered it?,"I needed one and got it and it is fine. How can you love a dish drainer? Doesn't exactly fit the sink, but I don't mind."
1,disappointment-overpriced,"I tried this line during a facial. They talked me into purchasing the entire line. I'm picky about my facial cleansers. This cleanser did nothing for me. I used the entire line for nearly 2 months, spending close to 300.00 and saw no real difference. I have no problem spending money on a great product, but ""more"" does not necessarily signify ""best"". Save your money and find another product that will work better and at a quarter of the price of this line."
3,Not much change to see with Vitamin C,"This cleanser gets the job done. Yet, most cleansers do. I do notice a difference when I use it with my Clarisonic. But, that is probably the Clarisonic and not so much the Vitamin C cleanser. I will go back to the Murad clarifying cleaner which leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and glowing. I don't know why I switched in the first place. You know us girls, we're always looking for something new to try."
4,good morning Vietnam!,"not bad but not the original soundtrack, music is good anyway of course and provides a few additional songs of the period"
4,i will not complain,"I thought this was an excellent book. I think Hazel revealed her illness in a way that made you feel like, Lord why am I complaining. To go thru so much and be able to raise a family alone and manage to work and deal with her health was remarkable. I have known Hazel for many years and until I read her book I had no idea what she was going thru. I can understand now there was no reason to pity her. Her book expressed her ability to go for the gold. She really is a strong woman. Even though her health is not good she still is able to volueteer to help others. An inspiring book."
4,Power-trio,"The Flow is another power-trio from USA, NY,(not in the same league as Blue Cheer or Grand Funk, but still...) which was strongly influenced by Black Sabbath. Although Pete Fine on vocals cannot compete with Ozzy, the band is very interesting and convincing - two tracks of flirting with classical music (Toccata, Third Movement) show the skills which are well above those of the better established musicians. Basically, this compilation covers the whole history of the group,albeit not so successful - there is enough studio work (sometimes unpolished) on the CD. A good purchase for every fan of 70s fuzz-guitar sound, and a real collector's item."
1,Ugh !! Music for goths and vampires,"I gave this one star because it has Steve Rothery on one track on guitar.I don't know what everyone is going on about. This is NOT prog, it is goth. There is nothing prog about this in my opinion. It is not enjoyable music. The themes are dark and unpleasant.The recording is TERRIBLE. It is compressed beyond belief, there is no extension on bass or treble and the sibilants sound scratchy. It sounds like it was put together in someone's garage."
3,Forces you to take a break after one playing.,"My last three music purchases have been non-standard slices of musical experimentation (Galahad, Circus Maximus and Sieges Even - all fantastic bands), and along those same lines I invested in The Reasoning. Yet again I got something completely different, but not as catchy. I know this band will grow on me from my first listen, but they were not as powerful an influence as the previously mentioned. I also think these guys are a mood based listen, and do not have as hard of an edge.As a DJ who despises rap, and critical music sceptic I appreciate what they are doing, and look forward to revisiting their vision within a couple of weeks."
5,Metal for Life,A true masterpiece from Metal Mike. The best metal album of year 2004. The album offers nothing but pure metal. You can find sample tracks at www.painmuseum.com
4,A good if cursory review,"I enjoyed this DVD very much, but clocking in at about 51 minutes (the box says 49, but the DVD player said 51 and some change before the credits), it's a bit short.It basically details the big bang theory, and a few rival interpretations of them, leading always back to the same conclusions based upon everything we know about physics.If you're looking for a gift for a science-lover, you could do far worse than this."
1,This thing SUCKS!!!,I ordered this for my MP5 and it doesnt even fit it....I also have a friend that owns a G3 and it didnt even fit that...I am very pissed off at these people...I called there office to return this product and they have given me the runaround for about 3 weeks now. DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!! THEY SUCK!!!!
2,Need guidance to use.,It's hard to say if this process could be useful I couldn't really get rolling with it from reading the book. It just didn't have the right flow. I couldn't make much happen and I stopped.This might be useful if someone trained you in how to do it. Otherwise I think the book is pretty much worthless.I bought this a while back for $29. It looks like they have really jacked up the price.
2,Don't waste your $$$$,"Sabian makes solid cymbals but this, B8 series sounds cheap. Pay $200 more for a better sounding Sabian. If you are looking to get a better sound, look for a Wuhan(Chinese made)."
3,A bit dissapionted,"First of all I have to admit that I have not listened to the entire recording. Mainly because I was a bit dissapointed by the singing of Mara Zampieri, and by the recorded sound.Mara Zampieri has a rather strange voice wich sounds the same the entire time and it is very mechanical. As far as the recorded sound, you do have to crank up the volume to hear it all clear."
5,"Absolutely, Positively, Unequivocally Great Rock and Roll","The Brodys's web site claims ""great pop/rock songs"" and a lot of stuff about regional and northern california, but this CD , ""Unexamined Life"", shows so much more. This is a great ROCK album that transcends any regionalism. There is no west coast, SF, LA, Sacramento, Boston, NY, Seattle, etc. in this sound. Its pure Rock and Roll and a lot of fun.The CD starts off with 5 smart catchy songs, anyone of which could have sold this CD on its own (especially Sunset Mess Around). Then it moves into the somewhat moody Doll House, and finishes with 4 more smart catchy songs that includes the brilliant 14 Miles Away.This is a group that is on the move. Get this CD now and with Christmas just around the corner...As a side note: I've seen these guys live one (or part of one) time and it was a blast."
4,Good Read / Slow Delivery,The book arrived in great condition - and is full of great information for any CAR PC project. I ordered a used copy and it took almmost two weeks to arrive. I found this to be disappointing since everything from Amozon usually arrives so quick. I be sure to verify who is sending my item instead of just looking at price next time.
3,Usually it's the other way around,"Would think that usually it's the other way around in real life, that someone looking for work would be stalking a headhunter or boss of a good company to get them hired, yet this movie was just the opposite. Overall it was not too bad, kept my attention well throughout the movie and was quite suspenseful. Worth a watch if you enjoy corporate/office suspense films.Peter J. Miller"
4,Classic Christian Slater,Christian Slater and Gil Bellows are terrific in this fast paced thriller. I enjoyed every minute right to the action packed finale. Christian Slater gives a performance as good as any he's had and shows he can still deliver. I recommend to all.
3,Hmmm what happened with the end,"You know this started really good, Christian Slater gives a pretty good performance but by the end I am left feeling like I am watching a made for TV Movie.. Regular fight suspense at the end could have went a little more the Firm. They used technology in it which could have went a little more Enemy of the State. They used a throw away performance as the guy that helps the pursued just to get him killed and extend the time of the film, mabe they should have spent more time developing the ending story caused I really like the theme.."
3,Christian Slater is the only reason......,"...this movie is being written about on this site. The script for the movie was pretty bad and the storyline was also poorly written. Christian is a great actor though and the mere fact that he was in this film, made it viewable. Christian plays a headhunter who is absolutely ruthless as he hunts down hispray. He even involves the persons immediate family by sending them presents etc. In other words, he just will not give up until they sign the dotted line."
1,Not good for the dairy free crowd,I purchased these drops to use for my 3 month old breastfed son. We went dairy free because he was having issues with his stomach.These drops contain caramel colouring which I now know is on the no-no list for the dairy free.Please know all the other names for dairy before you buy anything.
5,Good flavor,I read several reviews about the flavor and the baby rejecting taking the vitamins. My baby likes this one and has had no problems taking it and digesting.
4,Amazing at it is. Can we have a non-patriarchal Buddhism please?,"Fun discussion of some of the more obvious clues in the Lotus Sutra and other Mahayana that the sutras were literary devices, to reinstate an active Buddhism. I think it needs to further consider the fallen state of Buddhism at that time and how Buddhism had declined in favor of middle period upanishads that become more popular with the people, when these sutras had been written. I think the motivation of the authors was in the spirit of reformation of declining monastic sects and corruption in both hindu and Buddhist sects. Also, the cultural norms of the times, need to be considered as well, as modeled on family structure and social norms. The idea of reading the sutras as though they are ""conspiracy theory"" by literary tricksters, is certainly fun, but one might overlook the visionary, yogic background of the authors, as well as their obvious literary skills."
5,History well-written,"Ridenour's saga takes the reader back in time, the way things used to be, at least for one remarkable Kentucky family. The author has practiced the art of history well; the book is researched meticulously and written beautifully. No arcane tome written for dry as dust academics, THE GREENS OF FALLS OF ROUGH will appeal to the lay reader interested in the history of Kentucky. The book was one of only ten books nominated for the Governor's Award by the Kentucky Historical Society, given for the best book written on Kentucky history in the last four years."
3,Got mp3 album instead...,"I bought Held up, and some others, well, how would Irate/describe the album? AVERAGE. WHY? The tracks are new, true that,but many elements of fresh, unique styles are missing. However, HELD UP, first track, is pretty good and it kind of moves up and down from there, try it yourself, if you can."
3,"Some wonderful moments, but not her best","I became a Colvin fan with ""Cover Girl"". This work is generous, beautifully recorded and has some fetching music and turns of phrases. It is NOT her best work. P.S. If ""I Don't Know Why"" doesn't get to you (and it is as corny as they come), check your pulse."
3,Too Slick?,"Admittedly 'Fat City' was my intro to Colvin. At the time - 14 yrs ago - I thought it was 5+ star worthy.Don't get me wrong - even w/my 3 star rating, I find it a good disk. But when compared to her body for work, you get sense that it tries too hard in too many places. It becomes slick. A good disk for Colvin's work doesn't cut it. Most of her efforts are great.Larry Klein polished the hell out of these songs - to the point of almost taking the life out of them. There are exceptions - most notably ""Monopoly"" and ""Set the Prairie on Fire"". Even the hey-kids-lets-try-for-a-radio-hit ""Climb On"" works.I still like the disk - but I do not find myself coming back to it. I cannot say that of 'Steady On', 'A Few Small Repairs' or 'Whole New You'."
2,Too country for me,"Don't get me wrong. I love Shawn Colvin. ""A Few Small Repairs"" is one of those rare albums where every song is wonderful.While Fat City has some nice melodies, the production is decidedly country. The CD's best tune, ""Polaroids"" has a wonderful sound until the twangy guitar solo interupts. Deeper into the CD, Colvin lets off a few country sounding ""yips"" that I can only describe as Shania Twain-like. Yikes! Come to think of it, many of these songs could be in Shania's act.If you like that kind of music, this CD is for you. I personally like the more attitude and angst feel of Few Small Repairs."
2,Too country,"I loved her CD ""A Few Small Repairs"", but this was too Shania Twain like for me. If you are expecting something like ""A Few Small Repairs"", you'll be sorely disappointed. If you didn't like ""A Few Small Repairs"", you might like this one."
4,Works great.,Works as it should and durable. Only 4 stars because it's bulky and ugly which means it's great for home stereo use but not great to use with my phone.
5,Great,Works perfectly on Macbook Pro to use to watch videos listening to things etc. At a good price too is a steal
4,Not quite big enough,"I purchased the Medium size from fear of all the reviews on the Large size. As soon as it showed up on my doorstep I ripped the package open like Christmas time!I guess its just me, but it only took about 20 seconds to comfortably fully insert... product feels really good, I just want a little bigger!"
4,Doesnt stay in,I like the fact that it stretched me but i wish it could of had more of a suction cup and I wish it could of been longer.
5,Yippee!,I love this toy!I love the silicone material.I love the size.I have my man in the front and this in the back and I always end up on cloud 9!I also use it on him and he loves it also.The big O is always intensified for both of us when this is included.
3,Track Listing,1. Not That Kind (Album Version) 3:202. Not That Kind (Kerri Chandler Mix - Radio Edit) 3:463. Not That Kind (Maurice Joshua's Chickenpox Mix) 3:334. Black Roses 3:38Dissapointed that this is listed as a maxi single when all the tracks are radio edits.
4,Cool Idea,"I'm an 11 year old and I'm a Tony Hawk fan! I think that this is a good idea. As you may know already, Tony Hawk is rated T, but it is a fun game. I think it was good of them to let smaller kids have some fun with it too, but not with all the bad language and stuff. My only complaints are that some of the challenges are extremely easy, but I guess that this game was mainly for younger kids and they might have a harder time with it. My other complaint is that some of the songs are too...I dunno. I'm not very ""in"" to all that music, but there were a few good songs in this game like the ""where's your head whatever"" song. I guess that the music was mainly for younger kids too. Anyway, this game is a great buy. If you have children who around 8 years old, they'll LOVE this game! Even I do."
4,Sooooooooooooooooooooo Awwwwwwwwwwesome,I got this game for Christmas. My only Complaint is that Lil' Romeos voice is like a normal edit kid. I thought that it would be Romeos voice. In Zurgs World it has a low gravity crater that is good for ollies and spine tranfers.
4,Just too short,This game was an awesome idea but got put out too quickly. This game was great until I beat it on the second or third day. The characters were really fun to play with but had 5 or 6 easy objectives each. But even though the levels were short the create-a-skater was worth buying the game for. It was a fun game but I suggest waiting for the new Tony Hawk.
4,LOL funny,Best Channing Tatum movie so far. I was never a fan of the series so I didn't really know what to expect but it was well acted and I enjoyed it. I'd watch it again.
5,Laughing was an ab workout!,"I have never seen the original series so I didn't have anything to compare to. The movie was hysterical, especially because I graduated high school in 2005 so I could totally identify with the story line. Both actors did an amazing job and Ice Cube's appearance was great too. The storyline was also legitimate, nothing far fetched or drawn out."
3,Funny in places,"I wasn't expecting this movie to be as good as it is. There were only 2 moments that were groaners or WTF? moments.It's an enjoyable, funny movie, that moves along well. The plot is light, but not too simple."
1,21 Jump Street,Thought this was the actual movie and pissed off that it was just a stupid preview.Just made me want to watch the film even more.
2,Didn't do it for me...maybe because I was sober?,"I never watched the original series but knew of it and who was in it. The Depp role was great, but the comedy and quality of this movie was hit or miss for me."
3,Funny but crued,I have to admit... it was funny as hell! I was never a Jump Street fan so I didn't expect to enjoy it. It is crued though so be careful who you watch it with.
4,Hilarious,Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill was awesome together. This is a great movie to watch if you want to laugh your bum off.
3,WhatEVarrr!!,"Some laughs but not enough, some cool moments but not enough, some funny performances but not enough of them either. The script never really delivers the goods, and despite good chemistry between Tatum and Hill, this one never really catches flight.The nods to the tv show have a few good bits, especially Depp's scenes and [spoiler, look away!] ridiculously Tom Cruise-flick-like demise. And there are a few chuckles, no doubt. But all in all it just felt kinda flat too often. If you liked the show, you'll get some laughs. If you like Hill, you'll like him here. If you see Tatum as a basic brooding action guy, you'll like his vaguely comedic presence. But if you like really funny movies that don't rely on weirdly non-ironic violence, move right along."
5,Hope they do a sequel!,"I thought this was a very funny movie. I watched it with my teen age children and we all laughed hard, out loud. I never saw the origional but we hope they do a sequel!"
4,"Lots of fun, easy to download","We downloaded this movie on the spur of the moment to watch something with visiting relatives. First time we have ever downloaded, and it was super easy to do. The movie was very funny, high action and we all loved it. HOWEVER, don't show it to preteens because it contains lots of R-rated language."
4,"Funny, guilty pleasure","21 Jump Street is a funny, entertaining film. The two main characters, played well by Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, are two inept police officers who are sent undercover back to high school (much the basic premise of the original television show).The pair has difficulty fitting back in, but through comedic adventures and high-octane action, they uncover the drug ring and ultimately have success."
3,Pretty good.,Not a bad buddy cop flick. Jonah Hill looks weird skinny(er) and Channing Tatum really surprises with decent acting for once. Its got some funny parts but the best thing about it is that the movie knows what it is. Recycled. And it embraces it making for a funny self aware experience. It's worth a rent for sure.
1,Is awful a strong enough word?,"Talk about lame. Yes, I made the mistake of watching this lousy flick. Live and learn... won't be doing this again."
3,"Great Movie, but beware awful ""UltraViolet"" Digital Copies","This is a great movie. It's probably the funniest movie I've seen since The Hangover. It's really disappointing, though, that they chose to go with the UltraViolet digital copy instead of supporting iTunes. UltraViolet copies can only be streamed, meaning you can't watch them on an airplane or while riding in the backseat of a car. If you're buying the Blu Ray, odds are you want the digital copy for portability reasons, and UltraViolet is useless in that regard. Very disappointing."
2,Too many curse words.,Funny at times but to vulgar for my ears! I stopped watching in the middle because of the language and filthy ideas.
3,OK,"This movie is watchable, but not a must watch. So much potential. No character development or relationship development. Story is good, but done before."
2,Language @#)##*(,"Movie was OK I guess, but so much filthy language that I couldn’t enjoy it. Not for the faint of heart."
2,Uggh,"This movie did the tv series no justice at all. I never watched the tv show, but I heard it was pretty good--this was terrible."
2,"TV show put on the ""big screen"" that should stay on the small screen",Comedy was predictable and sad that every other word is the f bomb. The best part of this movie was to see JD in his cameo role.
2,The Jump,The slap stick in this comedy just didn't connect with me. I thought the actors were great. The silliness put me off.
2,21 Jump Street low marks on humor,"For all the high marks this movie received, I sure do not know why. I must be missing something. In my opinion, there was hardly any humor. Mostly childish pranks not worthy of a laugh."
2,Not My Kind of Movie,"I didn't think that I would like this, but read some fantastic reviews about all of it good points. I did not like this movie."
2,Didn't really pick up until the end,"The movie is not anything like the TV series with Depp in case anyone was wondering. TV series aside, the movie is supposed to be comedy with bits of action. Unfortunately, it didn't really start getting funny until the end. There's lots of crude language/jokes that tries to pass off as funny. If you're bored and have nothing else to watch then this is the time waster for you."
2,"Way, way, way too many F bombs","I watch this movie expecting to like it. Good cast and a great tv show that has become a movie. I am not one that normally complains about language in a movie, but in the first 20 minutes of the movie I bet they don't go 90 seconds with out someone saying the F word or worse. The story week and most of the humor wasn't what I think is funny. A few good spots here and there but overall BAD. I haven't seen a movie this bad in years. Maybe 22 Jump Street will be better."
2,Predictable Punchline Trash,"Probably both of their worst movie, based on basically genitals and getting high and a few predictable punchlines to try to make it funny. How anyone can give humor this lacking of any kind of substance or intelligence (even the so-called intelligence in the movie was not even close to impressive). I was disappointed. The trailer is pretty much all of the movie. The rest is just filler fluff that makes you want to cringe."
1,Pure Crap,21 Jump Street seems like it was put together in about two week. It was boring and I did not see one funny spot in the whole movie. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PILE OF CRAP.
1,A load of crap,Not funny at all!! The crude humor was over the top and not even inserted (no pun intended) to make the story better. Even the whole role reversal/fish out of water thing fell flat. Wait for it to come to TV if there is nothing else on.
1,Drugs give the laughs,"In the same vein as the recent movies that seems to cater a teen crowd : Ted, Project X...Watch scenes where the characters get stoned on drugs and smoke pot give you the laughs.Junk."
1,Horrible,"This product I did receive fast but, the product itself was defective an skipped no sound. Subtitles were on. This was not what I was promised highly disappointed!!"
2,They weren't even born in the 1980's,As the forty year old virgin age of humor came to an end with Walk Hard we get these millinel kids showing us they do indeed watch reruns and wish they had been part of a more exciting decade. You know these seth rogan movies were no longer funny after green hornet. But these well connected show biz kids certainly have chutzpah. Further testament that the nineties weren't that interesting of a decade as hollywood has broken their cardinal rule and are still drawing from the 1980's. The twenty year rule insists that they only try and rehash the 1990's. Further testament that American culture stop being interesting after Seinfeld.
1,21 Jump Street? Should be another title...,"The entire movie is just a sectional comedy that don't have good thing to remember or tell anything good and funny about this movie to your friends. It was only interesting because of the actors. Besides that, it's a slapstick comedy."
4,Hilarious!!,"I don't usually watch movies like this, but I had a credit on Amazon and I like Channing Tatum, so I decided to go for it. It was absolutely HILARIOUS!!!! Especially in a teenage-high-school-boy kind of way. I watched it over a week ago and still laugh about it with my co-workers almost every single day. I definitely recommend this one for a ""laugh until you cry"" kind of movie."
5,hilarious movie.,Ive never watched the old version of this movie or a show or whatever it was so I can't compare the two. But this movie was so funny! My husband and I loved it so we watched it about 4 times.
3,Passable,There are some funny moments in this film that had me really laughing. It was an okay enjoyable way to pass some time. But if you pass on this film don't feel like your missing out.
4,Pretty Funny,This movie gives you what most comedy films do now a days and that is a few laughs and some cliches nothing out the ordinary. It has the story line of almost Every movie dealing with friendships gone wrong and how they mend it. Great movie to watch with friends or a girlfriend.
5,Very funny.,We wanted to watch a movie that would make us laugh and this delivered. I wasn't sure if it would be just a dumb flick based on the concept and the previews that I saw but I have to say it really was funny. I really enjoyed it. It's a good comedy.
1,Jonah Hill ruins it...,"I get this is sort of a send up of an 80's classic, but it gets a bit insulting to the fans of the original. Channing Tatum's performance is surprisingly good, but Jonah Hill sucks the life out of about every scene he's in. His one-trick pony approach to being funny just gets old after about 5 minutes. I wish that I had something more positive to say, but this movie is pretty awful if you ever appreciated anything about the source material. If you have no clue that this was based on something else, I hear it's mildly humorous! ;P"
1,"such a disapointment,really wanted to love this movie","i was waiting for this blu ray for a long time and couldnt wait to get home and relax and watch 21 jump street. i was a fan of the tv show and was hoping that this movie would stand up right along side it, boy i was wrong, it wasnt funny,it seemd to drag on, the story and plot was weak and boring. even the gag reel they have in the extras section wasnt even funny. the only thing that i thought was cool about the movie was they had a few of the org. cast playing they old roles. other then that, this movie was a big upset in my eyes."
1,Disappointed,"My husband and I never actually watched the series. We were just looking for a fun movie. While we did laugh some, most of the movie missed for us. We just looked at each other during the movie, like, is this really supposed to be funny? We were laughing more after the movie discussing how the writers seemed to think streaming a certain word was apparently funny and how obsessive they were about a body part. A shame really, because I do think the premise was promising as a farcical comedy and it had it's moments. The Johnny Depp appearance was good, and I think I will try the series for an interesting drama series, but imo, this wasn't much of a comedy. I regret wasting money on it."
1,"Bring Back Johnny Depp, Please!","My wife and I went to see this movie, being fans of the original show. To say it was a let down is a HUGE understatement.I'm a fan of Channing Tatum, and he is usually very good in whatever role he is in, but he could only do so much with this script.The humor would only appeal to people who love raunchy jokes that take no creativity or imagination. There must have been at least a hundred references to a certain part of the male anatomy throughout the film, and I'm being conservative there.These guys are supposed to go back to high school as undercover narcs, and you you would think that would be cool and funny, but this is like dumber and dumbest in high school, minus the laughs. Anyway, I believe the joke is on you if you watch this movie, but go see it if you don't believe me.I give this a 1 out of 5."
5,I hope there will be the college continuation,"It did more than I expected. I did expect silly and boring but it was just opposite. The cast for two main characters is awesome, those guys just work together. The plot was good, I would like to see little more of a background for characters, I could even see this move evolving into a TV show. All and all I had a good laugh and I'm looking forward to a continuation."
4,21 Jump St,"I have to say, I love this movie. It's so funny. I purchased this movie after seeing it on the big screen."
1,Very disappointed,No where in the description of this product does it say it will not play in dvd player if you dont live in the uk
1,21 street,Quality of the video we poor. I liked the movie and could have better if I could have seen the rest of it.
1,If it were not for 4 letter words these characters would be mute,"Movie could have been ok (only ok) if the script writer knew any words other than F!@#, &$*$, $##, !@@@!#,**^^%@@. Totally ruined the whole movie. Don't waste your time with this movie."
2,Some Funnies; Some Juvenile; Some Pointless,"A lot of slapstick humor that the under 12s would appreciate. A lot of sexual, drug; language humor that the over 16s would appreciate, that is if they were still mentally stuck at under 12. The spoofs of action and chase films were nicely scripted e.g. which trucks are going to catch fire or explode and is turns out it's the truck with the chickens; the apartment drug exchange shoot out with the customary unlimited ammo. Acting was pretty much just act stupid and read your line with exception of Ice Cube who gave his character a bit of personality. A favorite foil for Hollywood script writers are school personnel and they didn't hold back for this fictitious school and to their credit created a couple of interesting portrayals but also had the usual stereotypes.A mindless tolerable entertainment for 99 minutes if nothing else is happening in life (like sleeping) but a more productive entertainment if ff to about half that time."
1,Disappointed,"The previews for this movie made it seem like it was going to be pretty funny, and, after reading so many positive reviews, I decided to watch it for myself. I was expecting it to be hilarious, and I kept waiting for the funny part, but it never came. It was vulgar, and it was definitely not necessary to drop the F-bomb every 20 seconds or less. This movie was a complete waste of 2 hours that I will never get back. I think I actually FELT my IQ dropping throughout the course of it. :("
1,rarely funny,Anything that was funny was shown in the preview. Very disapppointing. Best thing in the movie was looking at Channing Tatum.
3,Funny,"It was entertaining and funny. I would recommend it if you don't have high expectations, which hopefully you wouldn't have for this type of movie."
4,21 JumpStreet exceeds,"I guess I kept my expectations fairly low, because I thought this movie was so funny, I watched it 2 more times before my rental time was up. I urge everyone who loves comedy to rent!!!"
5,Hilarious!,The funniest movie I have seen in a long time! My girlfriends and I quote it all the time and can't watch it enough! Channing Tatum is such a bad ass!
5,21 Jump Street,Hillarious! You don't need to have seen the television show to enjoy the comedy of this highly entertaining movie. Brilliantly funny!
4,A Certain Kind of Humor,"The advertisements did not do this movie justice..which is unusual. Despite Channing Tatums history in other movies, this one is actually entertaining and funny. However, Jonah Hill is clearly the real entertainment because he is one who does well with this type of sarcastic humor. Not everyone can appreciate this type of humor, but I found myself laughing throughout the movie. Overall, It's definitely a movie worth seeing!"
4,Channing/Jonah Surprising Chemistry Saved This From Horribleness,"I wasn't expecting much from this, and plot and writing-wise, it pretty much met those mediocre expectations. But Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill were surprisingly good together I felt, and their chemistry - both in terms of comedic timing and in the buddy emotion department - got this movie up to 4 stars for me. Between that and the few laugh out loud moments that I got from this, I think it's a solid rental for an escapist Saturday night at home. I should perhaps mention that I actually never watched the TV show, so I had no preconceptions about that going in, which was perhaps a plus."
4,Clever more than laugh out loud funny,"I really enjoyed ""21 Jump Street's"" sense of humor. Over and over again, there'd be a gag that was extremely clever and funny while never sinking to Will Ferrell territory. This could so easily have been another ""Starsky & Hutch,"" but Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are better than Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. The biggest surprise was Brie Larson, who could be the next Emma Stone. Just a really funny actress who never went over the top and was truly likable. Also, the Cameo. The Cameo was the best and most natural thing I've seen that actor do in years."
4,So funny,"I didn't like comedies before but currently I bought a lot of them maybe because I wanted to change my lifestyle.This one was so funny that I actually cried during laughing.Two main actors' chamistry is so good and most of the actors are all very attractive.The story is nothing, but the episodes and each scenes make the movie shine like a diamond.So funny comedy.If you need to laugh, buy this one.It's a comedy so I wouldn't buy bluray though."
2,Juvenile,"This movie could been funny, but it was wasn't! I was sorry I bought it. It was filled with stupid humor. :-(("
1,Screw Movie Mars,Totally sent me the wrong region DVD and they know it...they refuse to pay S&H and are the biggest douches I have ever talked to...never had a problem.wit anyone on Amazon except these guys...bunch of douche biggalos...but besides that the movie is awesome...the one I saw in theaters...cuz I can't watch my own DVD!!! CUZ MOVIE MARS SUCKS AND SCREWED ME!!!
2,Just use iTunes,"You can't fullscreen the picture, connection was laggy and didn't allow buffering. Just download it on iTunes and start watching while it downloads. Great movie obviously though!"
3,It was an o.k. movie,It was a good movie to pass the time. There were some funny parts in the movie but it wasn't anything memorable.
3,Alright,"As mush as Jonah Hill annoys me, this movie was an ok movie. I would rather rent to movie then buying it"
2,horrible,horrible movie thaks god only pay 99 cents maybe others person like it i no recoment this movie thanks for read
2,Few laughs,This movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Wish my husband and I didn't waste our only movie night watching this.
2,Way too crude for my taste.,There were some funny parts in this movie but not enough to counter all the distracting language. This movie would have been much better without all the foul language. I'm not a prude but in this case the language was over the top and definitely detracted from the over all experience.
2,Don't waste your money,"The previews looked very funny for this movie, I was so excited when it came out on dvd. I rented it at red box before buying to see if it was any good. I am so glad I only paid $1 to watch this movie.. don't get me wrong there were a few funny parts but this movie was overall just stupid and boring, and only got a couple chuckles out of me."
3,It was ok.,This comedy was just ok. It's pretty much your standard issue slap stick comedy. I would probably recommend it others I think may like it..
2,Terrible,I thought this movie was going to be funny but it was one of those movies where the jokes and acting just didn't do it for me. It was trying to be overly funny. I really like J. Hill and all of his movies but I thought this was his worst. C. Tatum I just don't like as an actor especially when he is trying to be funny.
2,21 Jump St.,It was good intermainment to watch on my flight but I would not pay full price to see this movie on the big screen. Story line was not great and the acting was lacking.
3,21 Jump Street,This movie had FAR too much language! I think it actually detracted from the humor and the story of the 2 main characters.
3,"So, so movie",This is an entretaining movie but stupid trama. I don't know how parents allow their kids to make a movie like this. Theaching them that drugs is ok. I was kind of shock on that part.
2,Good Till The Last 30 Minutes,I was enjoying the movie and even though I despise Tatum he was funny in this movie until the last 30 minutes.From the explosion in the freeway on it just became dull and typical.The comedy was lame and Johnny Depp was stupid as a cameo along with his co-star from the original 21 Jump Street.Delete the last 30 minutes and this movie would have been a 5 star movie but alas for me it's just a 2/5.
3,Not for children of any age!,"I have no idea why hollywood thinks that if it add a ton of foul language, that would make the movie funny. It didn't need the foul language, at least not after every two words to be funny. After a while that's all you focus on unless you are also a potty mouth. Please hollywood, let's put out movies that the whole family can watch. We don't mind being realistic, but not over the top with the street language."
2,"Uh, not for me","Hey, I can understand how one might enjoy this film, but for me it was irritating.It got off on the wrong foot for me from the very first when the main character said 2 different things that I disliked a lot. First his line used Gosh Damn except he didn't say Gosh. This is a pet peeve curse of mine that I can't stand. Next he told some gang member type of character that he would beat his d*** off.What?The writers on this film continue to include pure gems like the above. Not my cup of tea."
2,Don't waste your time.,"I was hoping for something funny and entertaining. There were parts of the movie that were laugh out loud funny, but I became disinterested in the entire plot about 30 minutes into the movie. I say pass on this movie."
1,This was really really bad........,I rented this clunker from Netflix and only made it about 35 minutes or so into the film before I had to stop watching. Agggh! It was just terrible! Mainly it was due to bad acting; it seemed as if everyone was just reading from the cue cards. Dumb plot with corny tired old lame jokes (done poorly). I am so glad I only wasted a small amount of time and just a little money on this low rent excuse of a movie.
1,Extremely inappropriate,"First to start off this movie is extremely perverted, the movie says every swear word you can imagine my 13 year old even found it wrong so if anyone under 15 is watching they will not enjoy the movie the slightest bit."
2,What's the difference between Channing Tatum and a chunk of wood?,I'm not surprised you didn't get it. It's a trick question. There is no difference.I never saw the original series. I was traveling with my son and couldn't find anything else to see at the theaters. This was lame IMHO. The only fun part was the Johnny Deppy cameo at the end.
1,"LOVED the movie, HATE Ultra-Violet!","Saw this movie 3 times in the theatres and couldn't wait for the Blu-ray release! BUT, once I saw it was an UltraViolet release, I passed. This is what ruined GREEN LANTERN's Blu-ray release: UltraViolet BS. Ultra-Violet is NOT a Digital Copy. After signing up for 3 different websites (UltraViolet, Flixster & the studio's), Ultra-Violet gives you access to STREAM the movie. But you MUST have Wi-Fi capablity, or no movie! You never ""own"" the movie, only the ability to stream it. What a waste and a disappointment. DON'T BE FOOLED!!"
1,Stay away from ultraviolet!r,"The movie was great, but stay away from this ultraviolet crap! Its a sony scam to get you to put more of their spyware on your computer. Just stay away."
2,Motion Picture Rating System sucks!!!!!,"Hill and Tatum were GREAT in this, but....This was rated ""R"" and should have EASILY been pg-13 minus a few f-bombs. THE problem with the rating is the DRUG related material..Take out the drugs, and you can label ANY film with VIOLENCE and sex a pg-13 no prob. The system is backwards. Wake up and smell the _____!"
3,"Some laughs, spot the cameos !","I didn't have high expectations for this film, just sit back and enjoy, and that is exactly what you are going to get if you are looking for a movie filled with sophomoric type humor."
2,dissapointed,I think that it could have been tummy hurting funny. I really liked the plot of the movie. the only majority of the parts that were funny were showed in the trailers. Dnt belive the hype.
2,Not good,Just not one of those movies I like to watch. Looked pretty good when reading about it but lost interest not very far into it.
3,Good buddy comedy,"Hill and Tatum make a great, if unlikely, duo. This has some slow spots, but there are hilarious scenes, such as when they are forced to take drugs and then interact with the always stellar Rob Riggle. Great cameos throughout. Tatum is surprisingly good at comedy."
4,Not what I expected as a The Office fan,"There was some style to this film that I was not expecting. Although there was some surreal Lethal Weapon-esque moments I did enjoy the overall humor and chemistry between Jonah and Channing. As a fan of The Office and Parks & Recreation I got the jokes and enjoyed the cameos, you might too."
3,"Fairly hit and miss, but somehow manages to hold the average viewers attention.","For the most part, I found it to be a bad, somewhat boring and predictable, film which somehow manages to entertain by forcing you to wonder what mishaps Hill and Channing will get themselves into next. Despite the fact that they are seperated for a good part of the film there is no question that Channing and hill have on-screen chemistry that manages to keep the film together. Unfortunately, the script was rather weak. Many jokes will fall flat, but if u can manage to get by it than you'll see a Johnny Depp cameo which was pretty cool."
3,Silly-Funny,Pretty damned funny. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum work really well together. I laughed so hard at times that my stomach hurt. As long as you go in with low expectations you will probably laugh your a** off.
4,kept my interest,Didn't blow my mind but worth watching. Not something you'd watch for date night but a good way to kill a night off when nothing is on tv.
2,Terrible,"Although there are some parts which are funny. Overall the movie has a terrible story line, terrible punch lines and terrible acting overall. I would not even recommend this movie to my enemies."
2,A Different Slant on 'Police Academy',"The movie starts out interesting and a bit funny, but soon degenerates into teen-age silliness as the pair of unlikely, supposed brothers pursue a drug ring in the local high schol. En route, there's even a bit of romance, but overall it just wasn't worth watching."
2,Will not play at all..,I have tried to get the dvd to play on multiple dvd players but it just will not play. It's frustrating.
5,Great value for a great movie!,Love blue ray love this movie loved the price!!!!!! couldn't have been happier!! got it two days before it was even suppose to be here!!
2,goofy,"Stupid acting spoofs, especially when Jonah Hill meets his mothers friend. The best part of movie was Johnny Depp and his cameo appearance!!!"
2,Not Worth It!,"I love these two guys, but in this movie it just didn't work. It was a Bomb! Not only was the acting not so good, the storylinedidn't even make sense half the time!"
1,Foreign format,I was so excited when I got this dvd then tried to play it...nn it was unplayable. This led me to discover that they sent me an irish formatted dvd which doesn't play her on american dvd players. at NO WHERE on the description was this noted. They lost a costumer in me.
2,Bad...Bad,"I thought with the hot guy...maybe it would be worth a watch. I was wrong. After about 10 minutes I could feel myself getting ""stupider"" (I know not a word, right?) It is painful to watch it. Bad BAD BADDDDDDDDD!"
2,A Travesty,This was nothing like the original series. It was too stupid not even funny. Even the part where Johnny Depp played a short scene could have been eliminated.
2,not for the orignial tv audience,"I loved the show when I was a teen and figured that was enough to get at least a little nostalgia enjoyment out of the movie. I was wrong so I write this review strictly for those considering the film as a reminiscence. Let me be clear: I wasn't offended or incensed by the profanity or other types of humor as some other low-star reviewers. I just didn't find it funny, plausible, well-written or anywhere close to interesting. If you like Jonah Hill and the current strain of raunchy humor, this movie is for you. If you are more discerning in your humor, or looking for any of the heart of the old show, I'd reccommend watching a few eps of the original on Hulu."
3,If you like previews.,"If you like previews, this is for you. 21 Jump Street is an okay film for a Sunday afternoon watch."
5,Awesome,Really funny. I loved it. I would recommend watching. These 2 are great in this movie and I love Jonah Hill.
2,kind of dumb,Predictable and kinda disapointing. Ok if u r sick and stuck in bed and bored. Not terrible but it is mediocre.
3,"Silly, and Proud of It","""21 Jump Street"" is a movie satire that's too self-consciously aware that's a badly put together movie satire, and therein lies its quaint charm. The movie seems to be struggling against itself, against the mendacious machine that is Hollywood -- the recycling of bad television shows and bad concepts from a more innocent era when people watched stupidity with glee into a cynical era when people expect to watch stupidity, and it's this understanding that everything on the screen is stupid that fills people now with glee. Well, ""21 Jump Street"" does deliver."
1,21 jump street,It was terrible. I was so offended by the crude language. I thought it was going to be comedy not something raunchy.What a waste of money.
2,Bleep Bleep Bleep,I understand the need to censor the language but this 10 min preview was one long bleep. It would have been better if it was a clip that didn't have so much bleeping language in it. Turned it off immediately.
5,21 Jump Street,"Very good movie! Action, comedy, drama, all the things that make awesome movies! Watch it, you won't regret it! Channing Tatum really, really is a fabulous actor."
5,i love it,"i bought this movie as a christmas gift and also recieved it as a gift myself... WE LOVE IT, its hilarious!!!"
4,Surprisingly funny,"I wasn't planning on seeing this, but it got the vote for movie night. So, I watched it.Imagine my surprise when I laughed the whole way through. I seriously did not expect this to be so funny, especially since Channing Tatum was in it, but he was a scream. Yeah, it ain't Downton Abbey, but if you want a good laugh, don't think twice."
4,DVD,"I gave it four because the case was broken on the bottom. Other than that, everything else was fine. It arrived quickly and the DVD works perfectly."
1,Wasn't worth the time,I love this movie but amazon only offered a seven min clip of this great movie so I was disappointed
2,"21 ""DUMP"" Street!","Don't waste your time on this movie! Stupid plot. Channing Tatum as a high school student? Really? The ""over-acting"" by Ice Cube is so embarrassing! Jonah Hill should be ashamed of himself for being in this movie. No one in this movie is believable!"
1,Funny,One of my top favorite movies. It will keep you laughing.The package was all broken with I received it but I didn't try returining it because the disc was still intact.
2,Not so funny as i thought it would be,"Not that im saying Jonah Hill wasin't funny, it' just that he wasin't in this one. And when you executive produce and star in it thats proably to much. Channing was really funny did'int expect that at all he always does drama. I liked him big he had more humor as in his other ones:Superbad (Unrated Widescreen Edition),Get Him to the Greek (Single-Disc Edition)& His latest oneThe Sitter. The laughs were ok cant say it made me crack up like the back-cover said ""Your laugh till it hurts"" NOT. But it's alright, i would rent this like i did $1.99 not bad though."
1,Stupid,This movie wan not even remotely funny. I had high hopes for this as I think Jonah Hill is great. It was a dissappointment for sure.
1,The Worst Movie I've Seen...,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. While there are a few funny moments, overall this movie is a waste of money and time. It's hard to believe that critics actually recommend this movie for anyone over 12 years old...and yet it's probably not appropriate for young eyes and ears. Horrible Movie, don't waste your time and money!!!"
1,Awful,One of the least funny films ever. That critic and fan reviews suggest go or must go is beyond comprehension. Don't waste your time or money. Watching plants grow is more exciting.
1,This is a HORRIBLE movie!!,"This movie is utterly annoying. My 2 friends and I could not stand to finish the movie because it was so ridiculous. I can't even believe that this movie went to the theaters...DO NOT WATCH...you will want the 90 minutes of your life back. This is as bad as the movie ""Young Adult"" with Charlize Theron. A million thumbs DOWN!"
1,This could have been a great movie if not for the vulgarity,"I'm sorry, but this movie is a perfect example of how movies these days are so tainted by in-your-face vulgarity that the producers shoot themselves in the foot. My kids and I loved the original 21 Jump Street but I would go to great lengths to keep them from ever watching this piece of trash that could have been so funny. Seriously, how many references to ""sucking d***"" and anal sex can you put into the first hour of a movie? If you're not sure, either view a porno movie or rent this piece of garbage. I was looking forward to watching this movie and saw how great it could have been (some parts had me laughing hysterically). But, alas, I had to turn it off about halfway. Another potential classic ruined. IMO, they could have even made this a G or PG and it would have been just as funny. Double, triple BOOOOOOOOOO."
4,Funny movie,"It's not for youngsters, but it was funny. Going back and reliving high school is something i would not want to do!"
3,In the mood for a laugh?,"Not academy award material, but if you're in the mood to have several chuckles and a few belly laughs, this one deserves a look."
3,So-So. Worth 4 dollars to see.,"Just ok - crude humor, is it getting a little old? Predictable, overdone. I'm running out of words to describe this movie. See if it you're bored."
4,Channing Tatum's Best!,I'm not a huge fan of Channing's acting but he did very well here. He was funny. This movie is a good watch. I bought it because it made me laugh hard but I know other's that didn't seem to be as thrilled with it as I was.
1,plantar fasciitis,"they hurt my foot that has PF . i threw them away . this is not a good product for PF foot pain ,know cushion at all. i now use tuli's heavy duty gel and love them ."
4,Recommend!,"Tried several, including the plantar gasoline sock sling without much relief. These by far were the best and was able to do daily activities or better yet tolerate. In the end, 4 stars because I still needed a cortisone injection since pain was ongoing for 5 mtgs. Had I found these earlier I may have not spiraled out of control . Still wearing and feel great, now use for prevention"
3,Not the best!,These are just okay. There are surely better insoles out there. I don't think I gained anything from buying these. They did nothing for my plantar fasciatis.
2,didn't work,wore them for 2 weeks straight with no change in my heal which started acting up a month ago. the only thing that does seem to work are my logger boots since the heal is raised a couple inches.
4,very good foot support,"I bought this as a substitute for full-on orthodic inserts, and as best as I can tell, they're just as good! Not absolutely sure that I don't miss the additional lift under my artch, but this is excellent."
1,No pain relief at all,"I bought these as well as their gel heel cups for my 8 year old who has Sever's Disease. She's been wearing them for 2 weeks and instead of giving her relief, her pain seems to have gotten worse. She is now starting to walk on the side of her foot because she can't stand to step on her heel. I know not every product will work for everyone. This one didn't work for us."
2,"No relief, only more pain",I had plantar fasciitis for over 6 months at the time I tried these HTP Heel inserts. I tried them for 5 weeks and found no improvement in my plantar fasciitis. If anything the special accupressure bars that are supposed to stretch the tendon caused more discomfort. I would not recommend this product.
4,Instant relief,I have suffered with plantus facilitis over the years and am an avid walker. I have used it for 2 weeks and have just ordered another set. I am so pleased with this product. I did not want to go through the cortisone shots again. I am not totally pain free but the pain has drasticly decreased. I do the exercises on the Heel That Pain website as well as the inserts.
2,"Sorry, but I don't like Heel Seats","The ridges on the end of the seals away from the heel were more than I could ever get used to. My feet hurt more with these heel seats than they did without the heel. I think I gave them enough time to get used to them, but I am ""thumbs down"" on these heel seats."
3,HTP Heel Seats,I put them in cotton Tai Chi shoes. They don't cushion enough in a hard shoe surface. Its a cloth surface to the floor. They're also lumpy at the arch? I got a pair of Dr Comfort inserts and I regret I didn't get them first.
3,Questionable,"I ordered these to help with heel pain. I tried waring them in my athletic shoes for two weeks, but my heel pain was still very bad! I switched to an arch support and heel support insole and I think that is helping more. I also have been sleeping in a brace for my sore foot; that probably helps most!These are good, but I don't think they helped my problem. I think the pressure point hump irratated things more."
4,Heal of Approval,I took these to my podiatrist and she said they would work for most people. They did not work for me. However the ones I got from the podiatrist did not either. I bought them for heel pain. Still having it. Cheap enough to try it for yourself.
5,These are great,These work immediately and are well worth it.My feet feel great when I use HTP heel pads. I would recommend them to anyone that has heel pain.
2,Did not help my pain,"i bartend so i am on my feet all day 5-6 days a week. If my heels weren't already in pain i think these inserts would be comfortable. But it has done absolutely nothing but aggravate my heel pain and i think its kinda made it worse. not sure what it is but these were no help at all. my heel pain is located directly under my heels, not towards the back or sides. and where this insert lifts is exactly where it hurts. very disappointing. too bad i had high hopes."
4,"They work very well for plantar fasciitis, BUT","You must be patient. Some help will likely be noticed immediately, but it takes months to develop the problem and it can take months to completely correct it. The price seems a little high for peices of plastic, but they all cost about the same."
2,Not Very Good,"I bought this product to relieve heel pain. The product seemed to work for a few days, then it seemed to make the problem worse."
5,Nice inserts,After having these heel seats for a few weeks i must say i love them. My feet would hurt whenever i was on my feet for any extended period of time. My job requires me to be on my feet much of the day. The first week wearing these i must say they were not comfortable at all. I took a day off wearing them during the first week and since then i haven't left home without 'em. I realized a few days ago that my feet haven't hurt at work for some time now. My advice is if they seem uncomfortable give them a few weeks. I don't even notice that they're in my shoes anymore.
4,Really helped!,After trying drugstore inserts (that didn't work) I read the reviews for these heel seats and took the plunge about 4 months ago. I'm in sales and I travel frequently so it was imperative that I find something that works for my PF. The other reviewers here are right - you need to give yourself time to adjust to the fact that it feels like you're walking on a bar. BUT it took me about 3 weeks to get used to it and let me tell you they have helped. Now I don't dread that first step out of my car after a 3 hour drive or a long flight. This is not to say these heel seats are the answer and my PF is gone. I still have to stretch my big toe several times a day and even roll my foot on a bottle of frozen water. But the seats have lessened my pain.
1,Terrible,This product was a complete waste of money!!! I brough this product to the podiatrist and she recommended throwing them in the garbage. I was unable to return this product so it went in the recycling bin. Poor quality and construction and probably cost fifty cents to fabricate.
1,3 Days Later Heel Pain Worse,"I really bought these with a very optimistic attitude after experiencing pain in my left heel that caused me to limp for the past six months. I have done icing, taping, stretching and then bought HTP cups. It has only been three days, but it feels like a hump near my arch area with soreness and stabbing pain. I will try to bypass the pain and continue to wear them for a little longer if it will help..but so far nothing."
3,"OK, but not a miracle cure","I have flat feet, multiple heel spurs, scarring on nerves and very painful plantar fascia. These heel cups do lessen the pain a tad, but are not a miracle cure. I do find significant relief while wearing them in my Nike Air shoes, but found that when worn in my Birkenstocks or Crocs they did not stay in place."
1,No Good,I walk 4 miles a day 6 times a week and get sore heels. This had a couple of good reviews so I was excited to try them. Unfortunately they did nothing to help me. I did not feel that there was any benefit to these rubbery (not cushiony) inserts. Do not waste your money!
3,Not quite working right,"I can't get these to sit right within my shoe. They feel very hard right up under where they are supposed to bring relief (to the heel). At first, I only wore one, on the foot that actually has the plantar acting up badly right now, and ended up throwing my back out of alignment! Chiro said it was probably the heel cup and I should be wearing both at same time so I don't throw back and hips out. Duh! I actually knew that. Anyway... hard little cup that is not bringing relief like I had hoped."
1,slowest shipping ever!,"I ordered this product through HTP over 3 weeks ago, and they just sent them out today. And the only reason I found this out was that I emailed them repeatedly to find out when they would arrive. Like most people, I imagine, I ordered this product because I am in a significant amount of pain. If I had known how long the delay would be before they would even be shipped, I would have chosen a different product. I don't know whether they will work when they finally get here, but you can bet I'll return them if they don't."
5,HOLY SPIT THESE ARE FANTASTIC!!!!!,"I CAN NOT sing highly enough of the praises of the inserts. I have had Plantar Fasciitis for 6 years, and these are part of the cure. My foot was hurting so bad I didn't even want to stand up - EVER. These have helped tremendously. I combine these with a nice pair of crocs, a daily ice pack for 20-30 minutes, and the North American Foot Rocker and my Plantar Faciitis is slowly going away. :-)"
5,HTP Heel Seats,"Product provided much needed comfort and support for heel spur. Minor initial discomfort, largely due to prior inflamation."
1,Not a Good Option for Everyone and that included me!,"The logic behind these heel seats makes sense. The issue simply is that they didn't work for me, as about twenty other reviewers. Not only didn't I get improvement, my pain got considerably worse. So, luckily, I can return these to Amazon. I assume these work well for others, but as with most things so personal, it doesn't work for all."
1,HORRIBLE,BACKGROUND I am 47yr old m 5.11 165lbs play tennis 2 x a week. Have problem with leg knee thanx to quack surgeon appartently has caused Plantar Fasc in left foot. I tried the HTP and it made it MUCH worse!!! amazing. Now a week with out it and back to the orginal pain. I do have a narrow foot I dont know if this makes a difference I would avoid
2,Disappointed,"I was eagerly awaiting this heel seat after reading the reviews, well disappointed doesn;t even go there.I have worn the heel seats and am in so much pain still. Thinking i'm doing something wrong but there is only 1 way to wear them. Total waste of money."
1,no help..maybe more pain,"I was excited to try this product. It did not help, actually I feel more foot pain then before the test ride. Sad but true."
2,Did not seem to help me very much,"I had high hopes when I purchased these heel cups. I find that they hurt my feet while doing little to ease the pain. To be fair to this product, I also purchased some ASICS nimbus 13 tennis shoes which were reviewed as having excellent heel padding and I was not impressed by those either. Based on the review, I think you have a situation where depending on what the cause of your pain is, you may or may not get relief using these heel cups. For $25 bucks, it was worth a shot, but the gamble did not pay off for me."
2,not for me,I thought these heel seats would be nice especially because the cost is less expensive than my prescription orthodics. They simply don't work for me. I need to stick with what works for my particular situation.
1,heal that pain...,Sorry these did not work for me..I am going to have to return them..I was very disappointed after reading all the positive reviews however they did not help the pain at all...
2,not right for my injury,"I have developed bumps on the inside bottom of my heels and the pads of my forefoot that I believe is inflammation of tendons, but could be wrong. Anyway, I first thought i had bone spurs on my heels (other bumps formed later) and thought I would try these out. Well, these were not the right tool for the job. They seemed to put a lot of pressure right on the inflamed spot and actually made the pain worse (particularly in my running shoes). I thought maybe I just had to get used to them but it didn't get any better, and seems to have gotten worse worse. I'm switching to some Spenco insoles and initially those seem to be much better for my particular injury. I'm sure these work for some injuries based on the other reviews I've read, but not for mine. Incidentally, I've seen other heel cups for much less money at my local sporting goods store, so you might consider one of those before trying these. These seem pricey for what you get."
4,They work,"So, do they work?Yes!I had developed pain in my heels - mainly from playing tennis, and because of a lot of standing around at work.I ordered them through a company via Amazon - very efficient.At first they were a bit awkward, still hurt a bit. Now though, I barely notice the pain. Some days I don't even need them.I would definitely recommend them.I read that other ""inferior ones"" are ok, but that they are mainly for temporary comfort.I would just say - BUY THESE ones"
2,Didn't work for me,"I guess I'm the .03% that this product didn't work for. My plantar fasciitis must be more severe than most. I've pushed the limits playing basketball 3-4 days per week, now its hard to walk more than a block. The HTP Heel Seat is somewhat comfortable however there is almost no cushion where the center of your heel sits on the insert. If they would have put a little cushion there the comfort and healing may be more successful. They are versatile, and fit snugly in most shoes without removing the existing insert. Around the house I wore them with crocs, which I have found provide the most cushion. I wore the product for two weeks straight and found no appreciable pain relief. I recommend stretching and icing 3-4 time per day, with zero impact exercise over this product."
4,FINALLY A GOOD GAME WITH REAL PITCHING,I LOVE THS GAME BECAUSE YOU CAN REALLY CHOOSE WERE YOU WANT THE BALL TO GO AND ITS NOT FAKE LIKE SLUGFEST OR REALLY DIFFICULT LIKE MVP. THIS GAMES GRAPHICS RE VERY UNDERATED. THIS GME SHOULD BE A GRAND SLAM WITH ALOT OF PEOPLE
2,MLB 2004,"First of this game is a waste of money. The graphics are horrible and MLB 2004 has made now improvments from past MLB games. If i was looking to buy a baseball game i would get either ASB 2004, World Series 2k3 or MVP baseball."
2,Waste of time and money,"This game is alright but is unrealistic. The pitches never go the same direction. One time it will left, the next time it will go right. The graphics in create a player are so unrealistic. You can't even change the shape of the face and you also have limited stats. There is no way to create a player that is good at both hitting and fielding."
2,hmm,"didnt think much of this really _ I loved the Only Ones but find Perrets love affair with drugs just downright sad. Interesting liner notes, though put me off the music."
3,Panasonic,"The machine is a good working Microwave, but is not as solid as I had hoped. Some of the comtrols are not user friendly,(Like defrost. If you want a good Microwave and not the top of the line this will fit the bill."
5,Panasonic OTR Microwave,"This is a great microwave oven, but I recommend you take a look at the NN-H264WF for an even better bargain."
1,Don't waste your money,"I can't believe I actually bought this game... I played for 20 minutes and it is on it's way back to the store today. People say that this game is the most realistic, but I didn't have the heart to play it long enough to find out. The graphics are the worst I have seen for a playstation baseball game, and the gameplay is terrible. Don't let anyone talk you into this game. I honestly laughed out loud while playing, it was that bad. I can name at least 4 old Nintendo baseball games that were better that this, and actually had better graphics."
4,Shines as a baseball simulation - inching towards a complete experience,"The High Heat baseball series was distinct from Ea Sports' Triple Play baseball and other brands in that it tried to give you a realistic baseball experience, almost a no-nonsense style of gaming. That's not always such a bad thing. Giving the gamer the competitive feel makes it more satisfying to play.Graphically, the models, stadiums, and other details aren't quite there yet, but the gameplay makes up for it. Strategies exist here in this game, like bunting, hitting the other way, shifting, throwing certain pitches, small details like the such. It all adds up to one of the most complete games for 2001.I also like that you can create and edit existing players, something which has become quite a nice feature in today's gaming. Customization is a nice plus.I spent endless hours playing this game when I wasn't even a teen yet. If you manage to play this game again or just the first time, it's a classic and simply fun."
3,Not Much Better Than TP 2001,"After the failure of Triple Play 2001, I got this game, hoping it would be better. It wasn't. The graphics are lackluster, and if you don't concentrate on every single pitch, the other team will most likely hit a home run. Also, when a fielder has the ball, he throws it to the first baseman instead of the pitcher. That's one thing they really need to fix."
3,Mel Mcdaniel reloaded,"I bought this one for the song ""Plastic Girl"". It's pretty funny and one of his songs I had never heard before."
2,5 actual hits!!,"There are 16 songs of which 5 were actually hits. This isthe minimum criteria for me to buy, so I guess thats good enough!"
3,A better choice we have,This product is fine if you want to replace items for your Fuji gun but a far better product is found in accuspray guns. I wish I had not spent good money after bad. A 3 star is plenty when I think how this gun sprays.
4,New bulb makes a BIG difference!,"This bulb does not burn out as much as it get dim. It does it SLOWLY, soyou should replace it when you think your image is getting dim."
1,One of the worst PS2 game ever,"Overrated and boring game is a real waste of money and time that it makes Kingdom Hearts look like a masterpiece. A policeman kills people on the streets,jacks car,and shoots anyone one with a gun. This game gets old very fast and the camera angles make this game hard to play. The graphics are good and the missions are decent but the real reason this stinks is because those annoyning camera angles. Please play at your own risk but do not buy this. True Crime is real crime to release this at stores for children/teens to waste their parents or their money own."
3,"Not bad, but no GTA. Needs more music options.","It's an okay game. I compare it to Grand Theft, but unlike GTA there is nothing but rap music in the game. So for the more aware part of the human population, you will get sick of hearing the repetitive music. But hey, for you mindless-trend followers, you will be in heaven. The game play is like Grand Theft, but you have way more, and more brutal fighting moves. The game lay out is of the 300 square miles of LA California, but most of it looks the same. So it is hard to recognize where you are, or where you have been. The game has a random crime generator, which can be fun. It just get's annoying breaking up the same types of crimes over and over again. After a while you just end up shooting the criminals, because how many times can you really break up a fight? In all it's a good game. More music options would have been nice. It's worth $20."
1,one of the worst ever,"After seeing all the commericals and hype for this game, i expected something way more. This was overall one of the worst games i have ever played. The controls are nearly impossible to remember. The missions are idiotic and pointless. Most take less than a minute to complete while others take u hours to finish. This game is a cheap rip off of GTA 3 and Dead to Rights. The fighting in this game is crap. the driving is stupid. People say that being able to drive all over LA is a good thing, but u get lost so easily and if u try to get back somewhere it takes u forever to figure out where in the hell u are.Im glad that i rented this game before i bought it.I do not recommend this game to anyone."
2,"Car, Guns, and Violence","This game can be comparred GTA: Vice City but no helicopters or motorcycles and the music could be better. But the storyline makes up for it the classic cop seeking the truth to what happened to his father. The guns also are good the upgrade are ok and the fighting is fine. But one draw back is when you are fighting a major boss you cannot use your guns. The best part is you cannot die. But if you are looking for a replacement For GTA this is not your game. If you want a roaming game or just a way to releive tyou stress (go on a killing spree) this is your game. The senless violence and language aside I do not really understand how this game revived the rating that it did. There is no blood in the game, expect for the final movie"
2,"OK GAME, BUT I'M GOING TO GO WITH- GTA VC/GTA 3","TRUE CRIME IS AN OK GAME. THE ONLY THING BETTER ABOUT IT IS MORE SQ MILES TO DRIVE AND MORE FIGHTING MOVES. YOU CANT DRIVE MOTORCYCLES, HELICOPTERS, TANKS, YOU CANT DO CRAZY STUNTS, BORING STORY LINE, UNREALISTIC,. I GIVE IT A 2 FOR THE FIGHTING AND MORE SQ MILES. IF YOU WANT A MUCH BETTER GAME FOR A CHEAPER PRICE THAT IS STILL WORTH $50 TO ME, GO WITH GTA VICE CITY OR GTA 3.."
5,this game is the bomb diggity!!,"this game is way cool, but you are all right, it is way too easy. still it is very cool and the fighting and the fact that you can just go around to random people and search them for drugs is a cool and original idea. plus i love how almost everything breaks when you run into it (ie. walls, fences, etc...) overall, this game gets my approval and it is on the top of my list for best games.way to go activision!!!!!"
4,THE AVERAGE GAME,When first playing this game you realize that it is at first great with all the things you can do with it. Everything almost that you can do in real life you can do in this game. However the only problem with this game is the controlling problems. It is very hard to control the character as he fights and moves.I give this game about a B-
1,This game sucks!!!!,"I played a demo of this game thinking it was going to be like GTA, was I mistaken. The first thing I noticed was how annoying Nick is. The graphics are also very dissapointing. I finally got to one of the fights thinking finally, but it feels like your not even controlling your character. The driving is also very clunky. This is one of the worst games on the PS2 system. If you want a game kind of like GTA go with the Getaway, or Driv3r. Stay as far away from this game as you can."
4,cloning is wrong!!!!,"this is what i like to call a wannabe. wannabe games leach off the success of blockbuster games, such as, o i dont kow, GTA!! this game is exactly what GTA is, except your a cop instead of a villian. GTA now has a double pack, thats both GTA 3 and vice city for less than this one steaming pile of wannabe. GTA will do everything this game trys to much better, and you'll feel like a bad ass a long the way, instead of some tool with crappy one liners."
4,True Crime Streets of L.A.,"True Crime is a very good game that you can drive all kinds of cars from escalades to street racing cars to ferraris, so if you like shooting, fighting, driving, and just having fun i'm sure you will like this great game."
2,True Crime: Streets of L.A.,"The gameplay is great, the fighting and shooting modes are a lot of fun but the game is really weak in the length department. The game took me less then 8 hours to complete which I think is a rip off for $50. Vice City took me over a week to complete (full with all side missions). Although I loved the driving and actions modes the missions are way too easy (if it takes you more than 3 tries to complete a mission it would really suprises me) and the story is way to short, I would not under any circumstance recommend buying this, save it for RENTAL."
3,It's okay,"I was surprised how accurate they were about the streets of Los Angeles in this game. They had the major streets as well as the smaller streets in their correct locations, but regarding the scenery in this game, there is no difference between the Rodeo/Dayton intersection(Beverly Hills) and the Normandie/Florence intersection(South Central) which are VERY different in real life.The game gets pretty redundant.Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty Cityis better on every level, but this can be a nice break if you ever tire of GTA."
3,GTA is so much better,"If ur looking for a game where you can do anything, or kill anyone this is not the game. Get GTA:Vice City. True Crime is ok though."
5,What are you thinking? this game is the BEST,"I don't get why all of you people hate this game. If I read all of these reviews before I rented it i would never of even thought about it. And to that guy who said if you can't beat the game in two hours you are an idiot. Well your the idiot. you obviously didn't play the whole game. There are so many levels, it is impossible to beat it in 2 hours. you should check to make sure that you played the whole game, and not just the first branch. there are three branches. the game does get harder closer to the end."
1,True? No. Crime? Yes... in a contridictive way!,"Ok The title says true crime, yer? But you go around as a cop who can do what he wants! WTF! You can mug innocents and although it gets you a bad cop rating, in the end you do more bad stuff than the ""criminals"". Way too many glitches such as when you mug some one (yes a cop :S in GTA youre to be a criminal!) Breakdown: (before i die)Good.240sq. miles of Sweet L.a with real crappy background buildings :D. DunnoBad. All of it. Martial art moves which equal a stupid weak slap. Character you want to murder. Stupid catch phrases. Short, short!, TOO SHORT!. Waste of money. Cars suck. Guns suck. Stealth mode sucks. 3 crap games into one ultimate crap game. Too easy. Crappy endings. Overrated piece of filth. Nick Kang is a bent cop in more than one way. Cheap GTA rip offI could go on but im bored of it all! The game sucks!"
3,good but overrated,i got this game a few months ago and i completed it in a few weeks and aint picked it up since. i found some of the missions in it a bit repttive and i got frustrated with alot of them as well but overall it is a good game that is fun but u would probabbly be better borowing this game of a friend rather than buying it in my opinion
5,i have never played this game b4...,"but my friend rented it for a week, and he said it is better than GTA3 and GTA: Vice City. which i was surprised because i have heard this game blows. but gta is amazing and my friend owns gta: vice city, so TRUE CRIME must be great game! nice work"
1,how can you screw up a game that sounded so cool,"this game sounded awesome 2 hours after playing it and beating it I thanked God that it was my Stepdad's Christmas present and not mine. The figting system is the worst ever, the driving is like driving in a crappy arcade game, and the shooting is way to easy. Like I said if you can't beat this game in 2 hours you are an idiot. I haven't played many games worse then this one save your money and like everyone else is saying buy a different game. Go with the Getaway if you want a better game like this that isn't GTA at least the Getaways story and gameplay where good"
2,fake @$$ vice city,"I thought this game would be better than Vice City when I saw the advertisements on TV. But when I played the game for myself, I saw that it was just a clone. I am a very picky person when it comes to anything, and trust me, this game is not worth buying."
3,NOT any grand theft auto vice city,I thought this game was pretty cool at first. I thought the cars were ok and some missions were ok but not like gta vice city. The fighting missions are WAY WAY WAY too HARD. The game needs more cars and better graphics. If you dont like to get frusterated dont buy this game. This is NO GRAND THEFT AUTO game... trust me.
5,GTA's Brother!,"I know this game gets mixed reviews, but this game is tyte! Some noobs of the GTA series and such give it bad reviews, too bad for them. This owns a lot of games. It is a must buy. C'mon, havn't you dreamed of holding a pair of AK's and jump in bullet time? Here's your chance!!!"
3,does'nt come close to Grand Theft Auto,"True Crime;Streets of LA looked like a nice game,so I decided to rent it.I really had high expectations for this game.I started playing it, and I did enjoy it.But the missions are the most rubbish,boring and stupid ever.Not to mention the controls.Driving a car was so hard,the camera was terrible.But the one thing that really bugs me is the feel of the city.The gta cities had such a nice feel,I could go on playing for hours.The solving street crimes was interesting at first,but it soon got boring.My final thoughts on this game:You should rent it first,like I did,just in case you don't like it.The grand theft auto's were amongst my favourite game's ever,this one is certainly not."
4,Grand Theft Auto Or Max Payne?,"True Crime is in my eyes an exellent game. True Crime has the basic gameplay that you would expect from a Grand Theft Auto game or Max Payne, either one. With more combo moves than GTA, I would say the fighting is better here. The story line is great aswell, and to make this game exellent, lets add a couple tanks, helicopters, and motorcycles."
4,A serviceable shootem up,"Not a Grand Theft Auto, but a totally new franchise thats for sure. Instead of the criminal, you're the cop and it is your job to save L.A. Not that the streets of L.A. are actually this bad (I recommend people who actually live in L.A. should buy this), but it is a fun frenzy as you go on crazy attempts of becoming a good/bad cop. You lead the way, it's your choice, get out there."
4,A cool game,"This game is really fun. GTA vice city may be better but you can not compare them. GTA is much different. In true crime YOU are the cop, you are not the bad guy. There are fun missions to do, and then when you beat them all, you can stop street fights, chase street racers and a lot of stuff like that. I liked this game, some people dont so I would rent it first, but I thought it was cool!"
4,"Awseome Game, maybe 2 short?","So what it's not better than GTA, its still really tight. The driving controls are a bit frisky but you'll get used to them. The camera annoys the crap out of me. But, the only other flaw is that theirs not actually 100 missions. Their are lots of movies which are cool, but lets play the game.The kung-fu will get repetitive. Rounding up this game is tight and should efiantly be a keeper.P.S. dont expect this game to be as good as GTA, youll' get pretty P.O.' D"
1,This Game Sucks,I rented this game thinking that it was gonna be the next big game. Instead I realized that I was gonna have to pray to God that this would be one of those gifts I DIDNT get for Christmas even thought I asked for it. And what happened I got it anyway. So you know what came next- the day long search for the receipt. Luckily I found it and didnt have to keep this horrible game. (...)The only good part about the game was the driving and it still isnt worth 49.99 . (...)
4,True Crime,"This game isn't the best like vice city or those games. YOu should get it but if you want the best game wait for the new grand thef auto which i insure will be much better. this game is short and its not worth $50 if its on sale then buy it but dont buy it for 50 dolars. THis game has bad driving skills. If your on a street a car wont stop they will just hit you and that brings down your health which isnt a good thing. This game isnt awful but its not the ultimate either. you should buy this game cause it is good since you could drive around. The cars are good but the place isnt, you cant go in any bulding and they look fake like they were in driver1 &amp; 2. so the graphics arn't so goodbut still buy it cause its better than those other games."
3,"Good or Bad, u decide","Most gamers expect a gta style experience from True Crime. True Crime is both better and worse then vice city. true crime covers a larger area, 240 square kilometers, it also has better graphics. The game is A LOT more realistic, except for the dragon and demon part. Overall, the game takes about 5 hours to beat. Its also ok to pass missions and come back later or fail them altogether. U don't just get stuck like sometimes in v.c. The street crime stuff is relatively fun. There is a wide range of different crimes u have to stop, making it interesting. The game is has a wide range of different cars. Its fun and i would suggest buying it."
2,True Crime not all it's cracked up to be,"Admittedly, being able to drive around 240 sq. miles of Los Angeles is a neat feature. But I was disappointed with the game as a whole.Unlimited ammo for your pistols is unrealistic. You have to fight a dragon. A dragon!!! How can you call something ""True Crime"" when you have to fight a freakin' dragon!?!The replayability of this game is about zero. Once you finish all the missions, all you can do is drive around looking to bust street crimes. What you can play as Snoop Dogg? Whoop-dee-doo.Rent this game before buying it. I bought it, played it for two weeks and returned it for credit on SOCOM II."
1,riiiiippppppppp oooooofffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff,"THIS GAME BLOWS!!! BUY ""XIII"" IT ROCKS!!!I DION'T EVEN WANT TO GET INTO IT BUT ITS THE SHORTEST GAME I HAVE EVR PLAYED AND ON TOP OF THAT THE GAME PLAY IS DULL?"
2,is bad,"i expected this game to sorta good, boy was I wrong. it is terrible I hate the fact that you have to choose your missions from a menu screen and you can't just drive around and kill people."
4,Carlota,"This was a good book, even though Scott O' Dell has written better books. I really don't know how to summarize it, except that this is a book about a tomboy Spanish girl. It's first point of view, and (very) good if you just want a quick read, or an easy book to do a book report on, like I did. ^_^"
3,Bored to Death,"This very lackluster effort by Roger Waters is not even close to being in the same league with his earlier solo efforts: Pros and Cons of Hitchiking and Radio K.A.O.S. Those albums are much more substantive, creative and original than ATD, which borrows every sound effect from them and earlier Waters/Floyd. I love PACOH and KAOS so much, was sure I'd love ATD, and after listening too many times, I have to say I'm done with anything new by Waters (Live in the Flesh DVD was horrible), and I'm going to check out the Gilmour side of things...UPDATE: OK, I've listened more and while my impression has improved somewhat, for me it's not nearly as enjoyable as his previous work. 3 and a half stars."
2,Has he lost it?,"I will defend ""Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking"" and ""Radio KAOS"" until the bovines come home, but this disc truly makes one wonder if Roger Waters has lost it. Unfocused, untuneful, utterly disappointing. There are about three good songs here and the rest is repetitive, confusing, slow and, a first for Waters, not even very interesting. What a letdown."
3,Old man what the hell you gonna kill next,"I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan and just recently started collecting solo works by Pink Floyd. I heard that this was suppose to be Roger Waters best solo album so I decided to buy it. WOW!! What has happened to Roger Waters voice, its totally dead! When he sings it almost sounds painful at times. The lyrics are exceptional like all Waters albums but his voice has really aged. I recommend ""The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking"" or ""Radio C.H.A.O.S."", his voice sounds much better in those. Buy this album if ur trying to complete ur Pink Floyd collection."
2,Decent but unnecesary,"2 1/2Solid, if predictable and bloated continuation of Waters post-Floyd era suffers from self-importance, essentially still taking many ideas from mainly The Final Cut and recycling with a fair amount of success."
2,Am I amused? no not really,"Roger Waters... a awesome singer/songwriter, dont get me wrong but this album ""Amused to Death"" is far from what I expected from Roger Waters. The thing that annoys me the most from this cd is the background singers, boring lyrics besides a couple songs, I mean when I listen to this cd I dont hear the same Roger Waters I grew to like, and when I listen to this cd it just makes me think of how this wouldve sounded if Roger was still in Pink Floyd and how all of the creative talents couldve made a true masterpiece. This album is no comparison to the Wall or anything from Pink Floyd."
2,"Wordy, rambling","Waters packs his songs full of ""too many"" words. His themes are compelling, but he could have been better served editing his material by half. What he sings is almost unlistenable, like a combination of Bob Dylan and Mark Knopfler. Arrangements and mix and instrumentation are good, particularly the guitar work of Jeff Beck. I came away disappointed. THe brief instrumental ""Ballad of Bill Hubbard"", all by itself, said what Waters wanted to say with the entire album."
4,Roger's best solo effort,If you even remotely enjoy Pink Floyd do yourself a favor and give this effort a listen. This is of course not background music but something needing your full attention to fully appreciate. Give it a listen!!!! Dan
4,Roger Waters - His Best Solo Album,"This is Waters best solo album and although it has some flaws is probably the closest he has come to the glory days of Pink Floyd. Guitar god Jeff Beck guests on this one and helps to bridge the guitar gap missing on Waters albums ever since he split with David Gilmour. The album is another concept piece mainly revolving around war, politics, and more war. The themes of the album are as relevant today as when they were written in 92. Waters tends to be a bit wordy at times and has a tendency to drive his points home probably more than needed, but for the most part this is a solid effective disc. As with his other solo efforts the album failed to generate a lot of interest at the cash registers. 15 years later he has yet to do another solo album. It's a pity because I think with each solo release Waters was producing better material."
5,realistic,"I don't think anyone here actually caught onto the humanity of this album. IE- The song where they are talking about the innocent boy from Cleveland, and describing the american every day home life. They then switch to the scene where the missle is fired upon the streets of a ""political enemy"" yet they also focus on the normal home life of the man's married life. How would we feel if this was to happen to our families? This album makes you think about what our political wars do to people's families; both home and abroad."
5,Another masterpiece from Roger,"There are no much words to say about this CD, i only can tell you that Roger did it again. If ""The Pros and cons..."" was great in composition and Clapton's guitar work; this one is excellent too, in composition and Jeff Beck's guitar work.Roger is still in perfect form. If you liked ""Pros and cons"" and ""The Final Cut"", you will love this album.This is the obligatory reference from Roger's post PF era."
5,Like a cool mountain stream,"A damn fine bit of rock opera, after the rubbish pop they play on the radio this is like drinking from a cool mountain stream after living on fizzy drink."
5,A Unique Masterpiece,"This is without a doubt Waters` best solo album since he left the Floyd. The songs are arranged in such a way that they go hand in hand with the lyrics. The sound effects are awesome, and Beck is at his best. Gilmour and Mason may have the Pink Floyd name, but not the tools to create an album with such emotion and passion. A great piece of work that questions mankind and his ""wonderful"" creation.TELEVISION"
2,bored to death,"I'm a huge PF fan, but I feel like after David Gilmore and Roger Waters split up, they never really reached their potential. Gilmore's first solo came close. This moody album doesn't live up to the standards set by previous PF albums. While I'm no fan of the present course of civilization, I didn't find these lyrics to be particularly profound or persuasive and I really miss the guitar and harmonies from the good ole days."
1,"Evidently, God wants horribly boring music","Without David Gilmour to turn his banal meanderings into real music, Waters has created yet another totally forgettable album. This cd has four good songs on it, thanks only to the amazing guitar of Jeff Beck. The remaining fifty minutes of this cd is filled with songs that are so mind-numbingly bland they make elevator music sound like punk-metal by comparison. One star is a generous rating for this atrocity, given only because it is the least horrible solo album to be inflicted on the public by Roger Waters."
4,Learn to Love It,"If you are a huge fan Pink Floyd, you will like this CD. If you like the socially angry style of Roger Waters, you will love this CD. I am so glad I took the leap...I love it!"
5,love it!!!!,roger waters is the best!!!! three wishes is my fave off this album. my advice is to buy this album it is awesome
4,Roger's best album post Pink Floyd,You really have to put yourself there and listen to any Roger Water's recording from start to finish to really feel the impact of a concept recording. His best among his solo releases.
5,Rog!,"This album is simply a masterwork. Very emotional songs, arranged in a devastatingly powerful manner, all set to convery Waters' message of a society beset by false images and false realities.There is a book by Neil Postman titled ""Amusing Ourselves to Death"" which echoes this message, and, I suppose (but I have no idea) that Rogers must have taken his inspiration from it."
4,Roger Waters' best work after The Wall,"Pleasantly surprised by this album after being disappointed by pretty much everything else Roger Waters did after The Wall.Very atmospheric and mocking of shallow human culture, while at the same time the closing title track is oddly uplifting."
4,Belongs beside The Wall and The Final Cut,"Roger Waters / Amused To Death: This is another excellently written attack on War and the idiotic precepts that bring War about. While the writing is excellent, the musical performance is not as dynamic as the Pink Floyd albums. This is, however, still a very good album and not only should it be heard and owned, it should be placed alongside The Wall and The Final Cut. A four star album (4 )"
5,inspirational song writter,"roger waters is a person who tells it like it is, after hearing his music repeatedly for years i can't think of another person that could tie his shoes when it comes to writting music"
5,An excellent CD,"Roger Waters (Roger/Floyd)is my favourite writer and performer, so no matter what he makes i will love.But thats not why i love this album.When i first bought it i was disapointed...it was the first solo Roger album i heard.I expected something Floyd like or at least like the final cut.So i put it in my CD case and never mentioned it.Then about two months later i listened to the entire album.And i was amazed...i couldnt believe i practically threw this album away...ive loved pink floyd for years and rogers writing but in the past 4 months i love him 10 times as much after listening to this album and his other solo work...Roger Waters is for sure the best writer of all time."
3,Waters' poorest solo,"Sorry, but I disagree with almost everyone on this page. This is Waters' poorest solo record. For fans only, but those fans will be rewarded with some great songs and many average ones."
5,Number One and Beyond Bullets!,"I've had numerous opoortunites to listen to this Cd for about 10 years + now. It holds up and more, through repeated listenings. It's about as complete a retrospective of the state of the planet now, as it was when it first came out. But suffice it to say, the more things change...just listen to the thoughts of the Jet bombers over Iraq...The girl in Tienammen Square has not moved too far away, either.Starts with a WWI vet recounting how he had given his all to save his buddy...the real gen...when soldiers had some badges of honor...leading up to the American bombers who have no clue whom they are killing...But it's not a leftist CD...all war is equally absurd...Thus the aliens that have to do the absurd Anthropologic studies...If anyone can send me a note explaining how Waters got it confused, I'm here to answer.Lachryme@yahoo.com"
2,No-Doz required,"Once again, I fell victim to glowing reviews and purchased a CD without listening to it. What are you people talking about? This album is not good. Waters' voice is shot and I resent being beaten over the head with his social commentary. A little more lyrical subtlety would have suited me.Musically, I was nearly lulled to sleep several times before even reaching the fifth track. Plain and simple, John Lennon needed Paul McCartney, Roger Waters needs David Gilmour. And vice versa on those, by the way.I respect Waters as an artist, and usually revere him as a lyricist, but he missed the mark CLEARLY on this CD.Overly long, funeral-paced, and not lacking for obvious social cliches, Amused To Death dies a slow one.And what the heck is he thanking FLEA for in the acknowledgements anyway?"
3,overly long,"imo, theres only about 1 lp worth of good music which is about 40min.i get bored halfway through and his voice is shot. my fav track is 3 wishes i think.i recommend pros and cons and radio kaos over this."
5,Water's best,"In my opinion, after Dark Side Of The Moon and The Wall, this is Roger Waters' best work. You might hear it as a mixture of these two albums, on the other hand, it could be the continuation, or even, the second part of The Wall. It is very well done. Jeff Beck appears in it, and as usual, he sounds great, in fact, he is one of the reasons that made me buy this one (without hearing it before). And I do not regret it.The quality of the sound is extraordinary.I have not heard such quality of work from Waters since The Wall. I guess this one is way under rated. I do not know how come it is not well known.I hope he could release another one like this.If you are a Pink Floyd fan, or Progressive sound, you will love it.Buy it, no regrets."
5,This guy is brilliant,"If you like the final cut, do not hesitate to buy this one... it will open your mind. Earphones, something to smoke and this album is all you need to have a great evening...i swear."
3,Dragged down by the drone.,"There is a deal of truth in the assertion made below, that this is the work of ""The Artist Formerly Known as Pink Floyd"", but with one important difference. Oh, sure, lyrically it's up to his old standard, and the music is strong throughout: but his voice is ***. I just hope this is his final cut."
4,deathly good,"Thoughtful and timely musings on life, philosophy and politics performed with musical prowess by a master of the game.One is ultimately entertained and enlightened almost to death."
5,Where Pink Floyd would be if Roger had stayed on....,"This is the most significant album Roger has made since his split with the Pink Floyd. Technically and instrumentally it's an extremely complex album, with hundreds of overlayed sounds and several Floyd signature TV audio out-takes. It tackles the subjects closest to Roger Waters' heart, issues touched on in the Dark Side of the Moon, but revisited here in greater depth with more maturity: Money, politics, war and the frustrations and helpless feelings often evoked by living in the modern world. If Pink Floyd were still a ship steered by the emotional edge that Roger gave the band, this would be the product of the their labors. It's easy to listen to, and an album that's so full of everything a great album contains, that you'll find it hard to get fed up of this CD."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"When I bought this album, I was only doing it because this guy said it was great, better than any Pink Floyd album. So, I bought it with the mindset of, ""This guy is an idiot.. there is no way this beats 'Dark Side of the Moon' or 'The Wall' "". While that still held water (no pun intended), I was surprised by this album. It only proves that Roger Waters still has a few tricks up his sleeve, and the whole album is great. Doesn't compare to Pink Floyd classics that i have named, but Pink Floyd fans should check it out. I think Jeff Beck's guitar work was beautiful, though Roger's voice is like an old man. However, I did find it ironic that two of the biggest egos in music collaborate on ""Watching TV"". This album flows through, and you are surprised by the end. I have a low opinion of Roger Waters as a person, but I was still amazed by this album. True genius."
1,Almost Nothing You Need to Know Is In This Book!,"Lucky for me I checked this book out from the library. Let me save you the trouble. Don't buy this book. Judging from the table of contents, this book would seem to be informative. It definitely lists the things that are important to know about learning disabilities. However, I only wish that the content lived up to the expectations generative by perusing the table of contents. The only group that might find this book useful are the children that have learning disabilities. It might be a good introduction that they could read for themseves. Everyone else should check out books, such as the Complete Learning Disabilities Handbook by Harwell."
3,"""Truthiness?""","Things like this probably go on in Saudi Arabia, but I doubt that so many life changing emotional events like the ones in this book happen to and around one person, especially in such a compressed time frame. One red flag on truth is the Princess's son taking $1 million (and his sister's passport) from the family safe, and nary a word mentioned hence.For those interested in this topic, Carmen bin Ladin's ""Inside the Kingdom"" is a five star book. While she writes with restraint, I believe what she writes is true."
5,W o men of KSA,Awesome eye opening look into the lives of the women KSA...thought provoking gives you a new respect for the freedoms we take for granted
5,Great book!,Excellent book! I've read 2 of the 3 in the series. It kept my attention easily. I find Saudi Arabia fascinating.
5,Another great book in the Princess Trilogy,Another Jean Sasson book that I couldn't stop reading. Can't wait to read the last in the Trilogy. I highly recomend this book. Thanks Jean for writing this!
4,Princess Sultana's Daughters,This is a very good book that truly depicts life styles in Saudi Arabia. You have to have been there to really beleive it.
3,The first book was the best,"While the story of Sultana continues to hold interest, I found this second book to be a little drawn out. I think that there are one too many calamities that befall women in this book and now it seems a little unlikely that every kind of abuse imaginable is witnessed by one single person. I think that too may people take Sultana to be a real thing, when in truth there is a great deal of controversy surrounding the question whether the book is in fact a true story, or a work of fiction. In any case it is still an interesting book, but in my opinion not as good as the first one."
2,De ja vu all over again,"If you read ""Princess"" you would be wasting your time reading this follow up book. Nothing has changed in Saudi Arabia or in Sultana's life and in the long run - after 911 - who cares. What is most not believable about the narrative is that ""she"", Sultana, contradicts herself repeatedly. It is almost impossible to believe that her husband, and her husband alone, would allow her to conduct herself in a manner that goes against everything the arab male stands for - a female with a mind and will of her own, even a wife, that he would allow this female to dictate to him even in his own home, no less. Sultana does not always get her own way but I cannot believe she never suffered physical and a great deal more mental and emotional abuse than she says in this book. Not convincing. Again - who cares."
3,An okay book,"This book shows true revealing information about the goings on in Saudia Arabia. I decided to give another review. Make it less complicated.Princess decides to tell us the lives of her children. However what she fails to do is be discreet about it. I know books tells all but because the things she is saying can and will affect her daughters marriage, what others think of her, I found that appauling.I prefered her other book Sultana's Circle than this. For she tells of her daughters lesbian love affair and that to me is so private. She is gossiping about their affairs and I think it is simply wrong.I recommended her third and first book. I do not recommend this book for general reading only if you want gossip. Sorry princess."
4,Another eye opener into Saudi royal hypocrisies,"I bought this book only to delve into the lives of Princess Sultana's remaining family. After reading the first book ""Princess Sultana"" years earlier and knowing it had been a fantastic read, I didnt doubt Jean Sasson the author's remarkable ability to translate Saudi culture particularly of the younger generation. She has once again exposed the shocking, double-standards of the Saudi royal family. Having been to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia I wasnt completely in the dark of the kind of hypocrisy that exists between the super rich, middle class and the mutawa's (religious police), even so some revelations made my stomach churn. Read this book if you are a wandering and wondering spirit. You will not be disappointed."
4,good read,Good read in the Princess trilogy. I liked to learn about the princess's daughters and how different they were with the same upbringings. The read was really easy but you should start with Princess to understand this book.
5,Excellent read,"This book shows true revealing information about the goings on in Saudia Arabia. The only thing that I felt was horrible is how her daughters turned out. I see nothing wrong for a woman to a feminist but she has no respect for husband or her own family. There are things, I would not share, and would keep in a journal or diary. Most definitely stick to her life but out of others. She is demanding respect but has none.However, this book is wonderful, and a quick read, I could not pur it down. Maybe she will be watchful next time of what she says."
3,ANOTHER ONE SIDED BOOK OF SULTANA BY JEAN SASSON.,"RANKS OK .I,VE READ BOTH BOOKS PRINCESS & DAUGHTERS OF ARABIA BOTH I FEEL ARE ONE SIDED WITH MINOR REFERENCES TO THE OTHER SIDE. ALTHOUGH THIS BOOK TOGETHER WITH PRINCESS PROVIDES A PIECE OF LIFE OF A SAUIDI PRINCESS."
3,A work of fiction,"I actually enjoyed the first book of the three, as it was very vivid and actually interesting to read. This one I did not liked, as I found Sultana going on and on...and on about all kinds of abuse and yet she somehow was able to witness/hear of it ALL first hand?? What surprises me is that so many people here are raving about ""true stories"", and ""doing something about it"". Just because something is marketed as a ""true story"" does not mean that it actually happened! While I am not an expert on women in Middle East by any means, there is no reason to assume that every time you hear of something horrible befalling a woman who is presumed to be from that part of the world is true!"
2,Good reading but book 2 is not credible,"Book 1 was a great read but by books 2 & 3 I was convinced Sultana is not real. I think it is a collection of news items, gossip and J Sasoon's viewpoint that I was reading. After reading lots of books on the middle east and looking at her website, I have doubts about the truth in the book. This also makes me question what she says about what she reports about her stalker and lawsuit which is up on her website."
3,What happened?,"She's beautiful, smart, and well cared for. She has three loving children she can provide excellent care for. She had already aired the dirty laundry of the lives of Saudi women in her first book, ""Princess.""SO WHAT HAPPENED?There was little focus on Sultana's daughters, and I was expecting some sort of conflict-resolution to result as I concluded this work, maybe in the form of her older daughter being ripe for marriage combatting society. Furthermore, there was a lot of redundancy, as she took it upon herself to explain parts of the first book in the second book.I would die for one percent of this woman's material wealth. It's phenomenal, almost sickening. I'm going to read the third book now, so wish me luck. :)"
3,After reading Princess I couldn't wait to read this one!,"I had just finished reading Princess by the same author and couldn't wait to get my hands on this book to see the effects on her daughters. This book is much shorter than princess. (Finished it in a couple of hours) Although is was still very interesting, I found that Sultana's life did settle down a lot from her teens and twenties. I would like to see where the road takes her in her 40's and 50's."
4,Followup,"This book was filled with a lot of depressing stories, albeit, they were told well and interesting, but they were depressing. However, if you liked the first Princess book, there is no doubt that you'll enjoy this one too.It's not as good as the first, but it's a pretty good followup."
1,Not helpful at all.,"This book is more of a dime store novel then a helpful resource. It's mostly just words, words, and words from a doctor who like to hear himself go on and on. There are very, very few diagrams and the one's they have arn't helpful. A 5 minute google search on back exercises would be more helpful. I recently bought 5 back books from Amazon and this was the worse one."
5,Excellent source,"This book is an excellent source for practical information concerning the health and care of your back, plus it really is a fifteen minute workout of exercises that really work. I have been doing the exercises and no more back stress."
4,Great play doh toy,This is a great play doh toy. The saw works and keeps my son fascinated. I gave it 4 stars because I do not like the wood scented play doh. The white play doh that is included has a strong wood scent that is difficult to wash off hands.
5,Excellent pre-school software,I bought this software for my grandson when he was only 4 years old. He enjoyed the activities and learned a lot. At the beginning he needed my help finding different options and things to do. He mastered very quickly and he can do it all by itself.It's a great software to prepare kids to enter pre-school.
3,What can you say about a butter dish?,"The title says it all....It holds a stick of butter. The base is recessed a bit too much for my liking as it makes it a little harder to get the butter out with a knife, but on the other hand, the butter won't slide off the base easily. The service from Amazon was very fast."
4,Butter dish,Nice butter dish. Exactly as advertised. The only negative is that the top doesnt snap onto the bottom when the dish is being used. Other than that- great item.
4,Yay,Got it in excellent time and it is so cute - we got red. Keeps butter fresh - fits in our butter compartment perfectly - glad to have it! Make sure it snaps closed.
5,Rubbermaid butter dis,I can't believe I couldn't find this in the stores. I was looking for a plastic one to keep in our Camping Trailer. I wanted something that would snap shut while we traveled and not have to worry about broken glass on top of that.This was exactly what I was looking for :)
2,ok butter dish,"This butter dish is ok, but the lid does not stay on when you pick it up and it is not very attractive. It does the job, but the one that I used to have (can't remember the brand) the lid would stay on much better."
3,Not cat proof,"We bought this butter dish because it snaps shut, hopefully keeping the cat out of the butter. But the cat still knocks it onto the floor (expected) and can open it (unexpected). Maybe our cat has evolved opposable thumbs."
2,not over the top,"I got a red one which was cool since my kitchen is red. However, the top is very loose and comes off without much effort. I'm not sure if it is defective or if that is the make up of this item."
4,Just a good ol' butter dish!,"I'm not too sure why I bought this, because I realized a few days later I could have just bought it at a local grocery store and still be OK! It does hold butter, and for that, I thank the product."
4,Believe the reviews,"This is an excellent butter keeper for our frig. It fits into the refrigerator compartment and with the secure lid, it keeps the butter fresh. The only part of this product I do not like is that you cannot pick the color. We received a red one - not too crazy about the red, but the quality of this butter dish is so excellent, I just overlook the red."
4,RL,"I have been looking and looking in stores to find a replacement for the one I had. Other then the color I got, I love this butter dish for it's size and most of all for it's durability."
3,Kind of disappointed,"My regular covered butter dish finally bit the dust (hubby broke it). So I went looking for one that wouldn't be too expensive but would work. The reviews were right about getting red (although it hasn't turned my butter that color) and it being ""narrow"". The regular stick butter fits, but unless you're really careful about putting the top on, the top will get covered in butter. Because of that, hubby now leaves the top off - which wasn't the point of buying it. Needless to say, we will be looking for another product."
2,Didn't get what I paid for even at this price,"Price was certainly right, and a number of other people appear to have gotten a decent product, so I ordered one. Not worth even the few bucks it cost. The bottom is warped so badly a flat stick of butter won't stick to it, so teh butter slides all over loose. amd sometimes rolls off the tray if not moved carefully. And it doesn't stay inside the butter dish, because the lid doesn't snap on like it is supposed to, because the flat ridges it is supposed to snap over are warped. Butter dish wobbles in the fridge, lid falls off when you pull it out of fridge, and butter flops around on the bottom holder. The only reason not to rate it a ""1"" is as long as you leave it in the fridge untouched, it does protect the butter. Otherwise, I don't recommend it to anyone."
2,butter dish,Guess I didn't read the discription on this item as I didn't realize it was rubbermaid. wanted a ceramic butter dish.
5,WOW!,"Have a lot of butter? CHECK.Need another thing clogging up space in your fridge? CHECK.To lazy to open the foil or lid on a pack of butter? CHECK.You've found what you are looking for! This amazing contraption stores an open stick of butter in a convenient clear plastic container. No longer will you say, ""now where did I put that butter?"" Well there is is, in the clear plastic butter holder sitting on the top shelf in plain view!Holds the better well and keeps it nice and buttery for all your butter needs. Lead easily comes off for those late night stick of butter cravings! LOVE IT!!"
1,unbeliveable,This was a simple butter plastic dish with a cover. However it must have been boxed by a complete moron since there was no cover just a little plastic bottom.This is the second time I have had a problem with your outsourced providers. The last time it was a computer printer which never arrived.However I like Amazon.com and will continue to shop here. The customer reviews are particularly useful and I realize these errors are not your fault.
2,A couple of issues,Two problems (1) does not seal tight; and (2) raised edge around the trey prevents cutting the butter all the way.
2,Defective Lid Won't snap closed,"I have a much older version (maybe 10 years older) of this butter dish which appears to be the same design, except that the plastic is slightly different. The only reason I bought a new one, is that the bottom of the old dish is missing a piece of plastic after falling on the floor. The base and lid of the old butter dish snap together tightly, so that you can easily lift the whole unit by the lid, without the pieces coming apart. The new dish is supposed to be the same design -- It has the same plastic ridges which should snap together. But it just doesn't snap closed. I can use the old lid on the new base, and it will snap closed properly, but the new lid is just not the right fit, and sits loosely on the base. If I didn't already have an old lid that would fit, I would return this. BTW, the base is red."
3,Lid doesn't lock,I'm glad to finally get a plastic butter dish because I couldn't find one in stores. I wish it snap-locked.
4,Love it!,"We bought a refrigerator that does not have a built in butter dish and needed something unbreakable and covered. This Rubbermaid butter dish was exactly what we needed, and the price was right. The lid sort of snaps into place, and the only way I would improve it would be to have it snap in place more securely. Because of this I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
5,good lid,"The lid goes on, but not so tight that you have a hard time getting it open. It's just tight enough so that a child grabbing it from the fridge will have hope of not sending the butter stick flying. :) made w/ safe plastic."
5,"Doesn't Break, has a lid","My children have broken everything, including our old blass butter dish. I like my butter soft, so I prefer to have it on my counter, but the little fingers in our house love to find butter. The lid is snug enough that it's not hard to take off for an adult, but my 19 month old has to work at it - thankfully. Couldn't find it anywhere but Amazon. Very please with my new butter holder."
3,More glass,We like the glass because it is attractive and cleans up well. This dish works well but the round lid is often a bit slippery to lift offWe are still looking for the perfect set of butter dishes..
2,Standard Butter Dish,I was very disappointed. I received a defective product. I had to return the item and was told it was no longer available!
1,Way too narrow and sides too high,"At just under 2 inches, this butter dish is just wide enough for a cube of butter, with a tiny bit of wiggle room. That said, if you are a little shaky or careless putting the lid on when the butter is soft, you're in for a mess. Also, the place where the butter fits, the side walls are too high for the knife to go all the way through to make a clean cut. The walls are about 1/2 inch high, where the butter we use is about 1 1/2 inch. So all in all, it's pretty much a waste of money for us. Since I'm giving measurements, the inside length of space for the butter is around 6 inches. Outer dimensions are 3""x8"" and 2"" high"
5,Plastic Butter Dish Hip Hip Hooray,"We looked all over for a plastic, Tupperware, Rubbermaid, you name it - butter dish with snap on cover. Looked in all the discount stores, small outlets, large big box stores and no one carried a plastic butter dish. All had glass - but we were not interested in breakables. Finally I went to Amazon and I found the Rubbermaid quality butter dish. It was shipped and arrived in no time. It's clean, crisp, cover snaps on nice, fits in our fridge inside door compartment. Perfect. Price was right - liked the $9 price including the shipping. Look to Amazon before wasting gas shopping."
5,Rubbermaid butter dish,"Bought this to replace a glass one that got broken. Couldn't find this at my local stores, so ordered from Amazon. Works great! Lid stays on, and it isn't breakable! :)"
4,Good Rubbermaid Product,"Order was processed quickly. Rubbermaid has great products. Although this butterdish will be perfect, I'm not used to the butter sitting in a 'well'. It makes it more difficult to use."
4,Rubbermaid Butter Dish,"My main concern had been how well the lid snapped shut or held tight, which could not be determined by the picture or discription. It seems to stay securly closed however, so I'm happy with it."
1,Not what I expected.....,"I really should have paid more heed to the reviews already here. I ordered two of these for the express purpose of increasing my odds of NOT getting a red one. I got two. They really should be more upfront and just say you WILL get a red one. That alone would have prevented me from getting any. The dish is indeed too deep. I used it for one stick of butter, and during that time the high shoulders of this dish were chopped up by the butter knife. Not a well designed dish and I immediately went back to my 12+ year old Tupperware butter dish I had been hoping to replace. Not with these! Will keep looking, maybe Tupperware still has them!"
2,lid does not snap on,lid does not snap on and falls off in my hand not real good quality. the red color is nice.
4,"Amazingly hard to find in stores, any more.","I searched all the big box food and department stores - you just can't find a butter dish of any kind, anywhere.I'm on an RV, so this works perfectly, since you can snap the lid on. The red is kind of a funky color, but it will do."
2,cream,the product was not worth the price. i used it as described but did not see a difference over much cheaper creams. okay but not worth the price. will not buy again.
2,PLAYER'S CHOICE? What is this world coming to!?,"Seriously, when did this become player's choice? Let me tell you my story.I was interesting in buying finding nemo, but figured it would be like watching the movie, so I was not so sure. But we bought it, and I played it. About 5 minutes into the game, it starting loading. I figured it was only going to last 5 seconds like other games I have played. WRONG. I must've stared at nemo for 5 straight minutes! All he did was move around! Since it was nighttime, I got tired and just fell asleep. I went back to toys 'r us and told him it might be the disc, but this started happening as soon as I got it. But he told me I probably scratched it somehow, So he gave me a new one. But when I came home, the same crud happened again! 2 whole minutes staring at nemo swim...slowly...but surely...onto yet another loading screen.After playing this game, my eyes burned from staring and waiting so much."
4,Don't act like me: read this review first.,"After watching the beautiful movie, I had no doubt on clicking and buying this game, yet without checking opinions about it. So let's imagine THQ staff chating at the office, the guys with feet over the table, and the director tells: come on, we have to deliver this game until next weekend! And they just had the work of copying movie scenes and making a no concept, with terrible gameplay title. Last, and most important argument of all to hold you far from this game: the bigest challenge is to exercise your pacience with the HUGE loading time. It takes about 4 minutes (an eternity if you look at an ugly clownfish swinging at screen) to load a new level. You don't have clear goals to achieve, you feel like beeing pushed to the end of each stage. People of Pixar and Disney must be ashamed. It takes an unbeliavable distance beetwen the movie and the game. If you are not training your patience to be next Dalai Lama, trust this cheated player."
3,Finding Nemo - finding patience!,"As expected the game was full of wonderful underwater scenery with lots of colors that will keep a child interersted for hours and hours. However, the part that contributes to the hours is the waiting time for the next portion of the game to load. It seems to take a minute or two at times for the game to continue - wonder if it's my copy of the disc(?). Very annoying and very bad game design. However, because of the excitement of the movie and the cute nature of the characters, your child will wait....doesn't give the parents a needed break during the game breaks though!"
2,Loading?,The game is alright....but it takes FOREVER to load on GameCube. It takes about 5 to 6 minutes just to get the game started up again after you lose or pick a setting. I have heard the Playstation2 version is much quicker (loading wise).
2,The loading time is too long and frustrates my child,"My son is 6.5 years old and while he loves the adventure contained in the games, he is completely frustrated by the amount of time it takes for loading. The art work is beautiful but the game has a lot of technical glitches. I can't recommend it."
2,so far no good,My son just got this game as a gift - he is 5 years old. The game takes a long time to load. Very long time where we thought the disc was dirty or something else was wrong. I found a usenet post that discusses the same problem. I can't see my son having the patience for this.
2,Not Much Play Time!,"I was very disappointed when I bought this game for my home -- it actually gets the least amount of play time of all the games in our collection.The graphics are great, but the amount of time you have to wait for the segments to load is enough to have you load an entirely new game. The load time is much too long."
1,DONT BUY,I SAY DONT BUY THE GAME BECOUSE IT HORRIBALE!!!!! the movie was great how could be such a bad game. DONT BUY THE GAME!iit takes hours to load an the graphics are real bad
1,eww,i have'nt even played this game and i think its dumb. i have read the other reviews though. buy sonic adventure 2 battle or dx instead.
4,fun game,This game is awsome.The loading time only takes 5 seconds. I got this game for Christmas and I really enjoyed it. The only thing I don't like about the game is the Submarine level where Bruce is chasing you. That gets so annoying. I also hate the last level. Otherwise the game is great.

3,Slow!!!,"This game is fun but it takes sssssssssooooooooo much time to load. you press a button and it goes loading, loading, loading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Please dont buy this game.,"I did not believe the people that said the load times were so aweful and went out and bought the game for my 3 year old. Was I horrified at the absolutely long load times for every aspect of the game. On top of that the controls for Nemo are kind of difficult for young kids. If you dont believe me, just rent it and see for yourself. It is TERRIBLE."
1,Frustrating and boring!,"My seven-year-old son played this game and became frustrated very quickly. The game takes FOREVER to load, and the loading happens between every segment of the game. So, you'll spend more time looking at the word ""Loading"" than you will playing the actual game (which is boring, anyway)! Don't waste your money on this clunker!"
4,The Greatest DBZ Tape,"This DBZ DVD, along with Battle Royal, sets up for the final saga, the Buu Saga. The DVD is full of action and humor and is a most buy for any DBZ fan. While Goku, Gohan, Vegetta, and the Supreme Kai get ready to fight Babidi and a mysterious man, Android 18, the Mysterious Mask (Goten and Trunks) and Mr. Satan are still competing in the World Tournament. This is one of the best DBZ tapes out there."
3,bibidi babidi buu!,"the start of the babidi saga! and it looks pretty good. goku and the crew head to babidi's spaceship and after kibito is destroyed and piccolo and krillin turned to stone they head down to the spaceship to kick some booty! the reason it gets three stars is because there's no action in the first two episodes, but in the third episode pui pui finds out not to cross the saiyan prince! thank you vegeta! like he said, ""this guy is really annoying"". the expression on the supreme kai and pui pui's faces as vegeta, gohan and goku play rock sissors paper to decide who gets to kick the crud out of pui pui is great!! we also have some good emotion between gohan and videl. buy it."
5,Songbird,"Songbird where might you be? Thanks Nanci Griffith for pointing my ears to this beautiful songbird. Katie, tho your stay down here was short, what remains is exqusite, beautiful and peaceful. My eyes have not seen, nor my ears heard ever so beautiful a voice. I miss you greatly."
5,One of the BEST!,"What can you say....but, Kate is the best! We have really come to love her music. We believe she is the best of folk music."
5,Her spirit shines through,"This is a most beautiful, powerful album. I would recommend it thoroughly. You feel transported to a very caring place."
3,Murad product is good.,"The service was fast... no problem with that issue. the product itself is good... Murad reduce my puffiness a little, however, i expected at least 87% reduce under bags and for me it work around 70%"
5,Fast Shipping! Great Prices!!,"The locks were brand new, inexpensive and arrived quickly! These were hard to find here in town and my son is the only one with RED so its easy for him to locate his locker! Having the same combination for both PE and School lockers is helpful!"
1,RANDOM COLOR,As stated in other reviews these arrived in the wrong color. But hey at least I didn't get purple. I paid the extra couple bucks for colored ones and didn't even get what I paid for. FIX THIS
4,They don't make these like they used to,These feel light. Apparently the Master Locks no longer produce their own locks. They let Chinese manufacturers produce and sell these under a license. Of course they are going to cut corners.
1,Wrong Color,"A similar review has already been posted - there's no way to get the color you want, so you have to spend a bit more and buy them SOMEWHERE else."
2,Too Wordy For Kindle,"Metroblogging Seattle has the opposite problem that Seattle WA (blog) has. Seattle WA was brief and to-the-point yet not updated in months. MS appears to be updated daily, but event listings and articles are SO WORDY that I scrolled for pages and pages and pages just to get through one day (yet still found nothing of interest)."
2,Outdated,"This is a good book, I know the authors personally, but this book has then been updated so not all the info is correct and up to date. Get the new one if you could find it. Snakes of India...."
3,crip hop?????,"real disappointed in the track trued up. if hes so crip whys he got some slob on the anthem yeelling ""we stay flamed up/ banged up/ brite red laces/ flamed up chucks/ its piru till we die blood......""?? cant bump this crusin thru the neighborhood. other than that MOST of the rest is good."
1,fake rapper,"I for one hate this cd. Mainly because He is a rapper from san Fransico who tries to be a hardcore Rapper and Challange people like Jay-z, and Snoop only that to get his (...)kicked in a rap contest by these guys. Dont by bother with this cd if you are a true fan of rap."
4,I didn't want the story to end,"As usual Robyn Williams has out done herself. The main characters Ashela & Sam were in one word incredible. I was left wanting more. I need a sequel to this novel. The love scenes were more than just heated. The words actually brought you to the time and place that the characters were in. We have all had that type of love or all desired the all encompasing passionate love that these two main characters shared.The plot moved quickly and there were no dead areas in this book. I would recommend this book to everyone. Robyn Williams, my hat is off to you, as a writer you are one of the best, your books are loving and lyrical and truly portrays realistic love stories that speak to the mind and the heart."
5,A Twist of Fate,"This story begain as a deep experience for a little girl! Who grew up by the HARD WAY! Ashelas growth from childhood through adult life went from one extreme to another! Robyn left not stone unturned and definitely kept the reader totally involved with what could possibly happen next to this young woman!The story high and low points were descibed to the MAXIMUM! The style of writing is explosive! And entertaining! Ms. Williams, keep them coming like these Preconceived Notions and A Twist of Fate and you will definitely have a reader for life who will continue to pass the word on to other fiction readers!"
1,you've got to be kidding,I was previously a fan of Ms williams until I read this book. The first half is well written and keeps one's interest. Somewhere in the middle she lost me and I was never to be found. I am an advid reader of AA fiction....but not this time.
5,Spicy,"Spicy and hot! I loved A Twist of Fate. Robyn Williams caught my immediate interest with her superb character development. Then things just started to unfold. A Twist reminds me of the fact that the decisions we make can and do impact us for the rest of our lives. It's what we do to recover from not so good decisions and how we take advantage of the good ones. I've already passed this book on and have told friends it's a must read.. I can't wait to read Preconceived Notions. Robin, thanks so much for your work."
5,Magnificent!,"A Twist of Fate is undoubtedly the better of Robyn Williams' two novels. It certainly rivals any of the love stories I have read thus far. The story itself begins in such an enticing manner, with the heroine, Ashela Jordan, in conflict and reminiscing about the ghosts of her past.The book covers her ascent in the realm of the music industry and details all the turmoil she had to endure before she made it to the top. A Twist of Fate has incredible twists and turns, (although they seemed a bit abrupt at times) and I tried to finish it in one whole sitting (despite its hefty length and small print). The characters are well-developed and thoroughly enticing. Its not often that you can find such a detailed and marvelous book as A Twist of Fate."
1,Hated it.,I absolutely did not enjoy this book. I found myself skimming through it about a third of the way. It wasn't keeping my attention and there was way too much going on and I found it tedious to be expected to follow it all.
4,A Page Turning Thriller,"A Twist of Fate will have your heart throbbing, your mind whirling, and your nails gripping the side of your chair. You'll anxiously read each page anticipating the next shrilling encounter or loving escapade. Robyn Williams does an excellent job of making her characters real to the readers. You'll feel as if you know Ashela & Sam as if you've had them in your home for dinner. Robyn Williams expertly interweaves intrigue and romance using her sassy women, strong men, and sultry descriptions, to produce the next Bestseller....A Twist of Fate. Make sure that when you start this book, you've blocked off at least two to three hours for reading time because once you start reading, you won't be able to stop."
5,Beautiful,"Once again Robyn Williams has outdone herself. Her characters came alive and I thoroughly enjoyed Sam and Ashlea. All of the characters seemed very real to me. I thought that Ashlea grandmother Julia was a grounded woman with deep christian values who raised Ashlea as well as she knew how. But I was amazed how Ashlea turned out. Sam was such a charmer. Intelligent, handsome and so suave. Thanks Robyn for letting me go into your world and visit with Ashlea Jordan and Sam Ross. The book was done very well and I'm looking forward to reading your next book."
5,Keeps you turning pages!,"This book is truely wonderful and a true masterpiece. Ms. Williams keeps you turning page after page. You cannot wait to see what happens next. The characters were real and very believable, Ashela Jordan is truely a hero, a strong black women. The way Ms. Williams describes the scenes in this book makes you really feel as if you are standing in the same room with the characters. Sam Ross is truely a strong black male and a good counterpart for Ashela. I believe that this book is a true masterpiece and one that anyone would love to read. It makes you know that anything is possible and you can truimph through any adversity."
5,simply magnificent ! ......,"That an ensemble could play this beautifully is hard to imagine. If you've ever enjoyed a wonderful ensemble, a perfect concert, or a the thrill of a ""tight"", well-rehearsed concert band, you know then what to expect from this CD. The performances are great and the sound magnificent. The selection of music spans traditional to modern, and the ensemble rises to the occasion no-matter what the piece. A must-buy CD."
5,best intro to PC hardware I've seen,"Great explanations and diagrams packed into a relatively short book. I was able to read most of this in a couple evenings, yet I felt I learned quite a bit, for example the difference between a controller and adapter and why the IDE hard drive standard was considered an advance over ESDI and ST506. A relief from the plethora of 1500 pg ""upgrade"" books on the market, with their scholarly compendia of Intel chip specs and pinouts, and the superficial beginners books that are so broad-brush that you wonder if you've learned anything.One drawback is that the book is a few years old. Almost all the material is still useful, but some recent topics (Pentium III/IV, wireless, Windows 2K/XP, USB 2.0) aren't covered."
3,A good Reference resource,"It is written for the reader who is not a computer or electrical engineer but who wants enough information so that they can make intelligent buying or upgrading decisions, maximize their productivity, and become less dependent on others for help with their computer questions and problems. It is a great reference resource."
2,"Come on, Disney!!!","I'm not going to tell you how I played this game. I will tell you this though: this title seriously lacks any solidity. It's basically a monotonous series of little games that are more chores than fun. As Cinderella, you clean spots all over the house and nothing more, and I can't even remember what Belle, Snow White, and Aurora do. Ariel swims around and is ever-so-vaguely remeniscent of The Little Mermaid for NES -- which is still a great game, by the way. DP is not a total loss though, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. It has it's moments: Princess Jasmin provides minor thrills on her magic carpet. But Disney could do so much better.There are no girl-gamers and boy-gamers! There are only gamers and non-gamers! You don't need sludge like this to entertain a little girl."
2,May entertain princess lovers.,I bought this game for my 3 year old daughter who has been getting into GBA games lately. There are 6 different Princess games each with different game mechanics. This is good because it will keep the player from growing tired of the same mechanics. However some of the princesses stages are timed with poor level design which just makes for a frustrating situation. The other deal breaker is having now save system which forces the player to start over after every power down. Would only recommend for kids who are obsessed with Disney princesses.
4,I bought this for my 5 year old daughter,"She got this for christmas of 04. It was challenging for her but fun enough to keep trying. She finally asked for help and so I sat down with her and it was fun. Not hours of fun for adult, but it was fun. she finally finished the game and still plays it alot one of her favorit games.It is set up so the beginning screen shows all of the princesses. You can be any of them and have to complete 2 or three challenges each. Some are easier than others. After all that is done a last challenge becomes availible.The only bad thing is you have to use passwords to get back to where you left off. Although it helps with letter recognition.I bought a folder and we put stickers all over the cover and titled it Passwords. Then on the inside each page is labled with the name of game and she can write the passwords in it with out loosing that much needed info.Hope all this helped."
4,Not for Young Girls unless...,This game is really fun; but is more for older girls. They must be able to read unless mom wants to have to help every minute. If your daughter can read and loves the Disney series; then it is highly recommended. One of the definate perks is that you can choose which princess you are as you play. Very cute game.
4,A 5yr Old New Game Boy User,"My daughter is 5 and just got a Game Boy. This game is great, but only if know how to read. There are a lot of pop up screens that tell you what to do, but she can't read them. There is a lot of variety to the games. I find myself playing with it more than her, because she gets frustrated over needing me to read the screens."
4,Pictures alone are worth purchasing this book.,"After borrowing this book from a close friend, I knew I had to get a copy for myself. From Doreen Valiente's last poem to Patricia Kennealy Morrison's retelling of her pagan past (and present) with deceased husband Jim Morrison of The Doors, this book is a great addition to any pagan library.If your journey is just getting started in the craft, or your path is well traveled, these well known pagan leaders offer insight to their own lifestyle and spiritality, with common ground being an affinity with nature.The photos that accompany the interviews are brillant, with sharpness and clarity. Note: the Horned God was VERY inviting.Only drawback, would have like to have seen more pagan authors/leaders being interviewed."
1,Bad description,"Product description does not state if it is L/R to L and R or L/R to L/R and L/R.I need the first of the two options, if anybody is intelligent enough to understand basic audio gear and descriptions of it.@ Amazon Inc. : If your product description writers are incapable of understanding this, feel free to offer me a salary position to clear these things up for you, it does not need to be the equivalent of full time."
4,Great game!,"I love Pitfall! I used to play it when I was younger on the computer and I was excited to see it for XBOX. It was harder than I thought and different (slightly) than the computer version, but overall great!"
5,By far the most played CD I own,"This music is the richest sounding music the human ear has ever had the pleasure of hearing. From the Hadacol Bounce to Cuttin' out to Tipitina to etc. and beyond, every cut is played with that special Rhumba Boogie shuffle with the Proffessor singing at the top of his lungs. Whooaaahhh Lalalala. A whole lotta uh uh for you. This is the joy music was meant to be. And you too will be a Fess Fan! Just ask Fats Domino and John Bonham."
4,"""Tipitina"" Version Not as Good as Rock 'n Roll Gumbo Version","Now I don't claim to be an expert in ""Fess"" music but I am from New Orleans and have had Rock n Roll Gumbo for many years and love the version of ""Tipitina"" that is on that record. The Anthology is a great great record with 2 versions of ""tipitina"" but in my humble opinion, neither version measures up the version on ""Rock n Roll Gumbo"". This is probably a 5 star record that I had to give 4 stars to simply because of this one song."
5,Terrific Shirt!,"I have several of these Wrangler shirts and I really like them. The tough material is rigid at first, but softens over time through wearing and repeated washings. They look good and I'll keep buying them."
4,my favoriate hymns nicely done,"20 of my favoriate hymns nicely done, but sometimes the strings distract my brain from what I love to hear most, the harp sounds and the words floating on the melody in my mind."
5,This Song Is Da Bomb,"Cool Breezes single, Watch For The Hook, is awsome. I heard this song at my friend daves house and I knew I had to have the single. After listening to this I went out and got Witchdoctor, Goodie Mob and Outkast's CD's because they were feaatured in Watch for the hook."
1,"Well, there's trash, and then there's rubbish.","I enjoy reading all types of books, from classics to trashy novels. I have read hundreds, even thousands, and this is, without question, the worst book I have ever read. It was so bad that I kept reading only to find out how much worse it could get. I hope I can spare someone else the agony. The writing was simply awful, the plot was absurdly contrived, and none of the characters had any appeal or desirable qualities. This book's only redeeming value will be realized in the recycle bin. I guess that is what's indicated by the required one star."
2,Could have been better,"What had the potential to be a great book, turned out to be so-so. I knew within the first 10 pages what the great threat was without being told by the author. That did not however, prevent me from thinking it was a good story.What disappointed me was how the author got lost in her own words. It seemed as though she wasn't satisfied with the first description that she gave of the major ""players""; she had to do it again in much more detail. Where these descriptions were placed made the storyline disjointed.I did enjoy the premise of the story though. Miles French is definitely a hero, however unlikely."
2,Barely Worth The $$$,The Weatherguard kind of works. Unfortunately it looks like it was tested in a lab and never outside where there is 'Real-Rain.' The unit is worthless if there's any amount of wind or even a breeze and with rain there normally is wind.As good an option: A large clear zip-lock bag with a couple of holes and a rubber bands to keep it in place. Cost? 39 cents..
5,great,"This dictionary is exactly what I was looking for. It is about four inches wide and 4 inches thick. It is about 8 inches long. These dimensions are perfect to carry around. It's not quite a pocket dictionary, but it is easy to handle. It is a complete edition full of necessary information. I am very satisfied."
5,Pompeii...Buried Alive! (Step into reaading),This is a great book! The pictures and facts are very interesting and easily keep a child's attention. My son wanted to read it again as soon as we finished.
4,See a volcano,I think you ought to read POMPEII. It is very cool. I like the middle part. My desired part is at the end. My favorite part is when the volcano blows its top. By:
3,Stiching traveling in time,"Written in very simple language and with some of the fascination and disbelief of the era.Marco Polo's travels could be enjoyed if read with a map, discussing it with young teenagers.I read it with a story about the writter, who met Marco Polo when jailed.a good book for those who like traveling, but it is simply a description of different areas."
5,"super nice, great price","We are redoing our kitchen, new granite counter tops, new ceramic tile floors, and sadly, our ugly outdated white laminate cabinets, the king people recoil in horror from on home decorating and home buying shows. We did decide to upgrade with new pulls. We found these locally for 9.00 a pull, and got them on Amazon for half that. For 34 pulls that is a huge savings.All the hardware came, the pulls are really beautiful, and they even make our ugly cabinets look better- a great and not terribly expensive upgrade."
5,"Great advice book for ANY ADULT, young adults to older","I wish I had this book when I was 20-something! I was so impressed and amused by this book that I bought two copies, one hard back and one paperback, and am sending the paperback to a good friend. The book is full of good advice, writen with humor and in an entertaining way, which in no fashion diminishes the true value of the advice! The best part is that the book is concise, short enough that even those who are not inclined to read much, can polish off this book in a day or two. Good advice, for making yourself happy, getting ahead in the world, living a long and healthy life, presented in an amusing way. Highest recommendations!"
5,A Man For All Seasons (Ages),"A friend kept trying to quote from 'Rules for Aging' and I would shush him because I hate people shoveling out quotes as a response to a problem. Smart man, he bought the book and gave it to me. I have been laughing ever since. Roger is as witty (oops, sorry Roger-see Rule #14) and wise as they come. Mostly this book gets me in a good mood no matter how cranky I am. I use it like my I Ching. I close my eyes and select a page to learn my fate for the day and with out fail, laughter is the prescription. I recommend it highly I am giving this book to both my 30 year old daughter and my 81 year old mother for Mother's Day.A proponent of Rule #4"
5,This book sums up what life is all about!,"The authors 58 Rules for living have clarified how one should think about and live ones life. After reading this book I have recommended it to friends, family, and colleagues. I have also recommended it to many of my patients as a guide for living (I'm a Psychologist). Of course, in the end, the book and my review don't matter as summed up in the cardinal--- Rule #1---""IT DOESN'T MATTER"". I recommend this book to anyone who wants to really enjoy life."
2,Save your money.,"Almost nothing of value throughout. More rants than content. Author seemed to want to be funny, not helpful. Highly do not suggest."
4,Awsome game for pooh & piglet fans,"This game is awsome, but a little simple. At times you are running back and forth which is why it got the 4, but otherwise it is great. The graphics are good and the plot is excelent. It doesn't show much of pooh, it is mostly all piglet helping out others, and once in a while you get to play as tigger. All in all I rate this game a 5 (except running back and forth. Oh yeah, you can't save just anywhere you have to finish a dream and get the code, which is pretty complicated a combination. But the play itself is fun and easy."
3,I love the Tool But,"This is a great tool to check wires for any purpose,current,or continuity. The long end makes it easier to grab wires that are in difficult spots to get your hand on and the screw turn makes for a positive connection every time. The only complaint is the the end that you connect to your meter needs an adapter that is more than the probe after shipping. Why couldn't they just made it a female end?"
4,Useful but not perfect,I wanted to be able to pierce the insulation of automotive wires for test purposes. These probes do a good job of piercing the insulation but the connections at the other end are hard to use since they seem to be for special cables for a specific DMM. They are better than nothing.
1,Buyer Beware,"The Power Probe PPPP01 looks good enough, but it's difficult to use with my VOM without the Female Adapter Probe tip extender (sold separately). The extender is inexpensive at $3.56, but unlike the Green wire probe, it's not eligible for Amazons super saver shipping. So you must also add $6.12 S&H to complete the $11.66 probe. That makes the cost $21.34 + tax! Another gotcha from creative marketing."
1,I'm quite the angry customer,"I purchased this item today thinking it was the entire Blaze Battle, as I had seen it on HBO and was fully aware of the length of the actual program. I got the DVD and tried to skip to a particular Eyedea battle that I was waiting to see and noticed in the scene selection it wasn't there. Thinking this was just some mistake I fast forwarded the entire DVD trying to find it and after about 2 minutes of fast forwarding the DVD stopped. There is 16 minutes of battle footage on this dvd, the actual show had right at 30 minutes. This is completely unacceptable that a company would break this up into two parts and mislead consumers into purchasing them both. I've got movies twice the length of the actual show on DVD and a company sees fit to split at most a 2 hour DVD into 2 discs sold seperately? That is ridiculous and I feel horrible about wasting my $15 dollars on this."
2,Only half of the battle!,The show on HBO was only an hour or so long. Why did they need to split this onto 2 DVDs?! There is no extra content here. Very lame.
1,"half a show, someone messed up here....","I had seen this show in it's fullest on HBO when it aired November 2000 and this is some idiot trying to make a quick buck off this show. the show as others say is only a 1/4 of what they aired on HBO. This is wack. I'm glad I s[ent no more than $17.00 on both round 1 and 2 but so far I've only watched round 1, but I am already dissapointed in 1 and hope that the other disc finishes off the rest of the show as I saw it on HBO. this disc get's 2 thumbs down from me. the show is awsome but very little shown on this disc"
2,DONT PAY RETAIL!!!!,"Good thing I bought this at the ""USED DVD"" rack for $6. I was lookin forward to Eyedea's last 2 battles and next thing you know ENDING CREDITS?! No extras... At least it was worth $6. Sux when they cant put together a satisfactory DvD. O well"
4,Results Vary,"ok, i own a ps2 and a xbox, i have all smackdown and raw games. wwe raw 2 is not that good compared to the smackdown games on ps2 gameplay wise but graphically is much better. But overall even smackdown shut your mouth is alot better than raw 2. So if you have both systems, buy smackdown here comes the pain, but if you only have an xbox buy raw 2 because raw 2 is the best wrestling game on xbox anyway. One thing that raw 2 lacks is its gameplay. the AI is very stupid and the story mode is much like the story mode in smackdown 2 for ps1. But the create a wrestler mode is the very best. so if u only have xbox buy this game. but if u have ps2 aswell dont buy it because u will find it very disappointing."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I had been looking forward to this release for a while...i wanted it to be a sweet game but it was just a big letdown. The actual wrestling is poor.The season mode was supposed to be the high point as it allowed you to have total control of your wrestler's actions during an entire show. Unfortuantely i could never actually perform any of my desired actions (they always failed). despite my popularity being 100, I was stuck wrestling the same nobody's who had been bothering me since day 1 instead of the big dogs.There's lots of wrestlers in the game, but what's the point if the actual wrestling is no fun?"
4,Rey Mysterio,This is the firs and only game i have even heard of that has Rey Mysterio in it... from the screenshots I have seen i can tell that Rey will be a kick-butt character... WINE ME DINE ME 619 ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Not That realistic,You dont bleed when you hit them with a chair and you only stay down for 8 seconds!!!
4,Not that bad!!!,"C'mon guys, this game isn't that bad. Sure, Smackdown kicks its ass, but still its better the Wrestlemania, give that much credit. The graphics could be better, but they arent horrific, and the souund and match-types aren't bad either. If you have a Ps2, get Smackdown, but if you have an X-Box and settle for it, you can rent raw 2 first. Rent it before buying! Wrestlemania gets old and boring, however Day of REckoning is gunna be kick-ass, even though Smackdown 6 will whip their ass again!!!"
2,It is really bad,This game does have a big roster but it is really confusingThe graphics are good but it sucks.
2,Frustrating,"If you're a wrestling fan with XBox, your options are limited. There is no good wrestling game for the system, however, this will have to quench your thirst until something better comes out in the future. It's not horrible but it's nowhere near good. For starters, the control stinks. It's nearly impossible to defeat an opponent via pinfall because the referee takes an enternity just to count to 1. Also, the season mode stinks. I've never gotten a title shot yet but Stone Cold and Molly Holly have managed to win and loose the tag titles 6 times. Stone Cold and Molly Holly? What the f#@k! Buy this game if you want to, but don't say I didn't warn you."
2,Better than WWF Raw but...,"Yes, this game is better than it's predecessor but still lacking. The season mode is interesting but there's no plot behind it. You just beat someone up and maybe get a match after a while. There's no feature to challenge for a belt or request a certain match (solve 4 months of fighting with a Cell match).The CAW is very expansive but really nothing new.The gameplay is very simple and after an hour or two just down-right redundant and boring.The best feature in Raw2 is the ability to really tweak your ring entrance. Everyone knows you can rip music from CDs into the game but THQ also created some big Pyro effects that you can synchronize to your character and the music. Sadly the moves your character makes are pretty lame and most intros start with a shot of the audience so you miss any opening pyros. The only way you can see a wide shot of the opening pyro is if your guy walks out like Goldust or HHH.The game is good but I'll wait for Smackdown."
1,Not that good.,"Game froze every time I entered ""Create"" mode. What can I say? I'm a creativity nut. This was even after I cleaned the disc. Let's just say, it's no wonder that there were only 2 Raw games and, altogether, 11 Smackdown games, from Smackdown 1 on PS1 through Smackdown Vs. Raw 2011 on PS2. The Smackdown series was always superior!"
3,It's OK,"Raw 2 is a little ""so-so"". The gameplay controls are kinda messed up. The countering system works a little bit, and when you press the counter button before your opponent does something, your unable to move for a few seconds, allowing your opponent to do a move on you without a problem.There's not alot of moves you can do, it doesn't matter how you grapple them, you are limuited to a very few amount of moves.This game's roster is pretty good, many, many fans would have given this game a 5/5 if they did it just as good as the ps2 version.Overall, the game can be fun as long as your okay with doing repetitive moves several times a match."
2,WWE RAW 2,"one word describes this game when compared to some of the classic wrestling games from the past -- ""meh"""
3,"Good, but could've been better...","This game is one of the best games in history. the only problems with Raw 2 is that The game don't have The Elimination Chamber. Another problem is that it don't have Bra & Panties match. Another thing, The ref is SLOW!!! When you want to do a pin, the ref counts like if he's on War Zone or Attitude. Oh yeah, no Hulk Hogan, Not even Mr.America. Come to think, stick with WWE: Smackdown Here comes the pain for PS2..."
2,boring boring boring hey thq thats for you and raw 2,ok im gonna keep this simple this game is a waste of money .
4,they could have improve the more before they had release it.,they could have improve the more before they had release it. i can't still wait for smackdown!
1,Not even worth a dolla!!,This game is really bad!!.. The graphics are good ok one thing but the matchs arent that good smackdown has way more matches including elimantion chamber... I WOULDNT BUY THIS GAME FOR A DOLLAR!!! if u are a huge wrestling fan get a PS2 if u dont have on and Get Smackdown: Here comes the pain.
4,best game ever,"wwe raw 2 is as good smackdown here comes the pain and wretlemania xix.it has new superstars like john cena raw 2 has the best season mode, you could choose to do anything you want on the show.you could win new arenas and attack people from behind plus you could call out someone and fight them in a match.when eric bisshof calls you out you could beat him up or shake his hand and make the crowd booo you.the game is very good.AND THATS THE BOTTOM LINE CAUSE STONE COLD SAID SO"
2,Great Game-when it works!,"Great game, however, I have had to take it back for exchange three times (so far, this one doesn't work either!). It freezes, and will not work after that. The salesman at the store said many customers were having identical problems. They try them out at the store, but the systems at home won't support it. Is anyone else frustrated that you paid over 50.00 for a game that doesn't work on all xboxes? What recourse do we have when they only offer to replace the game, and none work??!!!"
1,Nuthing but hype.....,"game is pure garbage.if u didnt like raw,u wont like this either,got more options on game,but game play is bad,u should rent before even consider buying"
2,Yet another boring wrestling game.,"I am a big wrestling fan, so needless to say I was excited when I started reading the reviews of this game. Unfortunately, it does not live up to the hype AT ALL. The only good things about this game are the large number of wrestlers (there's a lot), the create-a-wrestler mode (lots of options), and the great entrance sequences (which are just like WWE TV). Unfortunately, the gameplay is terrible. It seems like everyone is moving in SLOW MOTION... It's not fun at all to play. If you like really boring games, this game might be for you! I was also upset to discover that the game DOES NOT allow custom soundtracks during gameplay (even though it says so on the box!!). It only allows custom soundtracks to make-a-wrestler entrances. Overall, this is a slow, boring game with nice graphics. I'd recommend Legends of Wrestling II or Backyard wrestling instead (if you enjoy ACTION over marketing!)"
4,Raw 2,"Let me start by saying that whoever wrote that Raw 2 don't have difficulty level is a liar, It do have it.Anyway,This game is okay, way (way) better than Raw 1, I can tell you that. Raw 2 is a great game but the stuff that's missing is this :1. Elimination Chamber2. Charlie Hass & Shelton Benjamin3. Ultimo Dragon4. BloodOther than that, what other game can you do Rock/Hogan 2?What other game can you edit your music?"
4,This is a great game,"This is a great game folks you can go on Raw and Smackdown on season mode although I think they said this game is not as scripted as Smackdown 5, where YOU the player get to decide on the matches and stipulations."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,wwe raw 2 is an enormus letdown. the graphics are worse than original playstation. the wrestiling is clunky unlife like. the controls are extremely difficult to figure out. if you can even nail a move for once it will be a big time crappy one like an elbow to the head. raw 2 is a waste the only thing you wrestle with is the controller. the entrances are a joke and when you enter the cage match the steel isent even around the ring its off to the side. i cant beleive this junk is even out there. if you own a ps2 forget this and get smackdown here comes the pain. it is user freindly and fun. dont get raw 2. this is a game that truly deserves 0 stars. and thats what i would have given it. 1 star is too kind.
1,wots all the fuss about?,"i do agree that raw 2 does look good fun.but wot is all the hype about?the match types and career modes look very similar to smackdown! the origional. i think that this game is very overated at the moment, as there is no proof that the engine is any better than wwf RAW, which waz dire. at the moment i wudent preorder it, as it doesnt look up to scratch. the graphics, whil improved, still look dated and grainy. so wot if u can climb a ladder?this woz poosible in smackdown! and in wwf wrestlmainia for the psone and n64 respectivly. i dont think that this is the game you are making it out to be"
2,What a Waste......,"This game is a waste of the WWE license. While it could've been a good game, Anchor decided to use the license to sell an unfinished game.This game is just bad, plain and simple. I don't want to list every bad detail because it'll just hurt my brain to write it out. I'll just give you some big failures: awful story mode, flawed gameplay, very lousy game music, slow-moving wrestlers, and extremely stupid computer opponents. There's a way more list of bad things to be listed.The only good thing about this game is its graphics. They're nice. That's it. Nice, but no where near as good as Smackdown Here Comes the Pain's graphics.It's no surprise that this game dropped to 30 bucks in a few short weeks. I'll let you know this: the price drop DOES have a meaning: this game is awful."
4,An ok game,"this game is ok.But its missing blood and you can't fight on the ramp and back stage. It also has goldberg,scott steiner,rey,and batista.this game has a season. but its kind of short this is an ok game but its missing some mathes areanas and wreastlers.PS this game is funer then wrestlemaina19 but not as good as smackdown here comes the pain."
1,Warning !!!!!!!!!!!!,this game does not have elimination chamber if you are loking for a good game buy smack down here comes the pain and play with kane unmasked and have a elimination chamber match or first blood just because xbox is so powerful does not mean that it has the better game this game comes out in 3 to 4 weeks make sure you cop it i have seen so many videos on htcp and it looks like its going to give raw 2 a run for its money.but the only compliment that i could say about raw 2 is that it is way better than wrestlemania xix.raw 2 has no blood.do me a favor get hctp the first day of arrival. enjoy!!
5,Raw 2 rules,"I Bougt the game when it came out and its the #1 game.It has new wrestlers like Goldberg,Rey mysterio,and Scott Stiener.It even has a royal rumble in a cage.It is THAT DAMN GOOD!If you have Xbox you should buy it."
2,Avoid At All Costs,"I was extremely excited about all the new THQ wrestling games coming out and out of Wrestlemania XIX and Raw 2, Raw 2 definetly got the leftover put into it. The game is horrible and is full of glitches. There is no matches compared to Wrestlemania X8 or XIX it doesn't even have a better story mode then Wrestlemania XIX. I hated the story mode in XIX I hate Raw 2 story mode even more. The Wrestlemania XIX exhabition mode is so so so so so so so much more better then this. On Wrestlemania XIX you can steal your apponents special move or use on of your 8 specials yeah thats right. Once you beat the story mode you get a extra special for anyone however many you want if it is a extra grapple,striking,jumping,or ground you can add a new special. Plus XIX has a cool store. Im sorry I was excited about this 2 but I guess Wrestlemania XIX is alot better.Raw 2 6.5 XBOXWrestlemania XIX 8.6 GamecubeRaw 2 is really that horrible. I would rent it first..."
2,one step up,"picked this game up on september 17 hoping that the sewason mode would be worth while. After playing this game for awhile I can only say the graphics are great the sound [is bad], there is no dialog besides your occasional grunt or fan cheer, the season mode seems to have no direction behind it it is just match after match after match. Will try it out for another 4 days before returning it for credit for nhl 2004"
2,Ripped Already,Flag looks great and flies just fine. Problem is after barely four months of flying one of the grommets ripped completely free of the flag. Should have lasted longer.
1,Horrible Graphic,"Once the picture is enlarged enough to fit this large flag, it is pixilated and awkward to the point that it does not even look like an earth any more. You can't even identify a single continent in the collection of colors in this almost black circle with weird yellow splotches. Maybe if it was far enough away, your eyes might be tricked into thinking this was a picture of the earth... The most disappointing purchase I have ever made on Amazon."
5,"More Precious Gifts from a Rare, Much-Missed Artist","Kate Wolf recorded the title song of this album in her hospital room during her final, fatal illness. Heard today, the song (The Wind Blows Wild) is haunting, evocative, visionary, and a little melancholy--sheer poetry that will make you miss Kate Wolf even if you've never heard her before. Other outstanding cuts here include The Rising of the Moon, Old Jerome, and a studio version of perhaps her most famous song, Give Yourself to Love. This is a lovely album from a real artist, and truly deserves your attention."
4,"Love it, but statistics are out of date",This is a great book - a must read for anyone pro-life or pro-abortion. It breaks down arguments in a logical and easy to read fashion. The only thing that bothers me is that the statistics are really out of date (about 10 years now). I would jump at a new edition!
4,Great Resourse,"This is a great read. It will give you a logical, scientific and reasonable response to anything that pro-abortionist throw at you. The answers can be wordy and redundant at times but there is so much information here it is good to hear it a few times."
5,Call Me Coach,"This book kept me in stitches. I couldn't put it down until the wife told me to turn out the lights. I haven't enjoyed reading a book like this since ""All Creatures Great and Small"". ""Call Me Coach"" is very much like that series and it is well written. I loved it."
3,Works but...,Does what it's supposed to and it's good for a quick meal on the go but quality of the entree is a bit less than Chef boyardee.
3,Good concepts but no implementation advice,"I'm now just more than half way through with this book. So far I find the book with good concepts and patterns that addresses a list of issues for security development. I find the patterns described lack implementation advice and how to verify them in real-world deployment. The authors might know when it comes to security development the devil is in the details and this book lacks those details - just how to implement them. From my experience so far I liked the following books - Gary McGraw's ""Software Security: Building Security In"", for Microsoft security - Mike Howard's ""Writing Secure code"" and for Java/J2EE Security - ""Core Security Patterns"".Overall this book aims at people of academic interests than software projects."
3,Interesting view,"It's an interesting idea to recast security principles as design patterns, but it lacked the succinctness of the GoF patterns."
4,Security Patterns Review,I bought this book because i am new in the field. This book gives me a lot of practical tips. The examples in this book are great to use in architecturale documentation i have to write.
2,Theory with out proof !,"The book is bundle of good theoretical material discusses in a very high level but not much help for use in real-world application development. Although the book claims to have 46 patterns for a variety of security problems, the authors completely forget to illustrate the pattern with appropriate architecture model or solution strategy. Unfortunately, every chapter forces me to question ""how to make it work"" or ""show me the code"" ! If you are a developer, you would not find any guidance for identifying a development strategy or an example driven solution using .NET or Java or even opensource. The IP Telephony case study is more of a high-level representation of patterns than a real-world implementation model. The book is also too expensive ! The book may help someone who wants high-level overview of security issues and solutions but I am not convinced how these patterns help a developer."
1,Huge Disappointment!,"I bought this ring and was so anxious to receive it. When I opened the package, it was just as it said very beautiful. Unfortunately within 2 days the ""Rose"" coloring started to come off and by the 3rd day the stones were all clear white! I am very disappointed and would NOT recommend this product to anyone looking for a ""Rose"" colored Swarovski ring...you may as well color yours in at home for free."
2,Too compressed,"This is my first NFD album. Being a big fan of the Fields of the Nephilim, this was a no brainer. The music is great and I can understand the comment about this being better than Last Rites. The vocals are awesome and the music has an alluring energy.Sad thing is that this cd is way to compressed and everything is way too loud. This makes it hard to listen to and really destroys the magic in the music. No dynamic range at all."
2,angel music,This is my least favorite of all the Llewellyn music I own. It sounds more like a country music cd. cannot be used during meditation and not relaxing at all/. I thought the music sound really corny.
1,3 later - I'm done,"I had one of these for a couple of years and it worked well. When it stopped working, I assumed it was because it had worn out - I play a lot of Beach Volleyball so I figured the sand shortens the lives of things like this. I ordered another. It lasted a week before it wouldn't pump up balls - returned it to Amazon who replaced it no problem. Replacement worked for about a month.....Find a better quality pump."
1,Too big and bulky,"Bought this product because I needed some sort of protection against broken needles. This pump has a latch on the outside which protects it to a certain extent, but probably won't protect it from a hard hit. That being said, it's better than nothing. The real issue is that this thing is REALLY big. That grey plastic, which I figured was a cover that came off, is actually part of the pump. It kind of looks like a light saber, too."
4,Mehta comes off better the less you know,"These are lush excerpts from Strauss operas played to the hilt by the Berlin Phil. In the music that everybody knows, the Rosenkavalier waltzes, Mehta is not competitive--his readings are big, generalized, without wit or special interest. But who really knows the music from Der Liebe der Danae or Intermezzo? It's garrulous and unispired compared to Strauss's best, but a nice plunge if you like warm chocolate. The recording isnt the best. Horns are far away, strings very up close, winds buried in a bit of a haze. I think I like Mehta in this musci mostly because I've never heard anybody better--and don't need to."
5,Better than the Genesis games,"This game is better than I could have hoped for. I would go so far as to say that this game is better than all of the classic Sonic games made for the Genesis. The addition of Cream is great. She fits right in with the rest of the characters. The graphics are wonderful. All of the characters have new animations but handle exactly as they should. The audio is classic Sonic and the boss battles are challenging but not too difficult. Since most all of the characters must be unlocked in order to play them this adds tons of replay value. And above all else, it's just a fun game to play.Graphics: 5.0Sound: 5.0Control: 5.0Fun Factor: 5.0"
3,Not bad!,"This game really has made some improvements from Sonic advanced - the graphics are more detailed, there are more characters, and there are special bonus levels. The downside is that to unlock new stuff and characters (besides Knuckles, Cream and Tails) you need to find seven special rings which are hard to find on every level.Overall I think the game is pretty fun. I suggest it."
3,I almost didn't like it,"The game's graphics are ugly (especially if you're used to Crash Bandicoot's graphics). The levels don't feel like levels, but instead feel just like a track with loops and ramps. I couldn't even find all the 'special coins' to compete for a Chaos Emerald! Because of this, the Chao Garden isn't even open. The sound isn't great; the most you'll hear is the sound of coins. The music sounds (unless I'm going crazy) like it's being repeated on some levels (maybe with a small twist to it). I don't recommend this game unless you're a hard-core Sonic fan, because I am very disappointed."
2,almost as bad as sonic 3D blast,"For the graphics capability of the gameboy advance, and the quality of Sonic games that origionally appeared on the Sega Genesis/Megadrive, this one was badly put together. Just like the first Sonic Advance, this game has you running around loops and slopes so much that you hardly run into any of the adventurous level layouts that SONIC TEAM so well thought out when creating Sonic games for the Genesis Platform. I'm an advanced gamer and I found myself dying way too often in this game, mostly from running sonic into bottomless pits. This game is a pass"
2,"""Worst sequel ever""","My god! This game is absolutely horrible!! The boss levels are hard and you have to run to kill the boses. That's gay. Also, you only have Sonic at the beginning. My advise: Get the first Sonic Advance. Stay away from this..."
2,THIS GAME IS SO STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is stupid because the sp rings are hard to find, plus the levels are too boring and last the boss attacks get harder when you finish a level.PS. Don't EVER GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!"
1,Bad. Buy something Else!!!,"I loved the first one.what happened?the music is okay...the controls are fine. those are the only good things.sometimes very frustrating.can't go to chao garden UNTILL you beat the game WITH all 7 chaos emeralds.it's part of ""completing the game""and you can never unlock anything new just by beating the game alone, you NEED all 7 chaos emeralds.sometimes this game runs slow too.and very VERY frustrating when beating a boss because you never get 1 ups because their so hard to get.so you get about 3-4 tries on a boss. seems like enough? nope.i've also gotten stuck on a very VERY hard level, and after a month or two i finally beat the level.DO NOT BUY! use your money on something worth while like Sonic Advance 1, or Super Mario Advance 2 Super Mario World. Just don't buy this cheaply made peace of junk!"
4,Better than SA,"After playing this game a bit, I've found the characters look better, the levels are a little more challenging, and there's more of a story to this. I don't like the idea of unlocking characters because Knuckles is my favorite and I can't play the whole way through with him. :( The levels seem to be a bit more challenging, but it has a definite lasting appeal unlike the first one. Sure you have to run for the bosses, but that's not uncommon in the Sonic games. Take it from a ""Sonic Freak"" and buy this!"
2,sonic advance 2,"This game has many bad things in it.It is veary hard,poorly made,all other characters besides sonic must be unlocked,has no codes for it. And finally, you must unlock the Tiny Chao Garden by collecting all seven of the Chaos Emeralds."
4,sonic rulz!,This game is a solid b+. It would have been an a but its just too short! Its h-e double hockey sticks tryin to get all the chaos emeralds just to get amy rose and a chao garden! Other then that this is a very worthy addition to the sonic series.
4,sonic the supersonic hedghog is back,"This game rocks!!!!!!! i bought it on monday march 23 2003 and i love it. This game has sonic, tails, a new character called creme, my alltime favorite knuckles and it also has amy as a bonus character. Ive almost beaten the game with sonic and havent beaten any levels with the others but i have played with them. theis game is the best sonic game ever (excluding the gamecube ones) but it has one downfall. ITS TO SHORT. that is the only reason i gave it 4 stars not 5. but if you've played sonic games before you know that you never get bored with them. plus they have sweet multiplatyer racing game that only works if you both have the game. but for all you sonimaniacs out there that cant afford a gamecube this game rocks and its worth the money."
5,tottally cool from every point of view,"This game is tottally cool. My game is in Japanese,though. I can't win the level 5 flying land one. Although the game has about 10-15 levels I really like playing it. I love playing it all the time. I always play with Cream because her Chao does the fighting and she can fly. I secandly like playing Tails because he can fly more distance than Cream. And there is a secert character,Amy! That's right the girl that likes Sonic is here. You must beat the whole game though. It was hard doing that. I still play all the time and occasionly. I even have a special stratagy:ALWAYS PLAY WITH CREAM OR AMY!"
5,Good for Kids,"This is a great game for kids. My 7 year old loves it. He says: ""It's fun because you can rescue characters and a really cool part of the game is that you can get special awards"". The music is pretty good, too, not annoying."
2,"Boring, boring, boring!!","I..I..I can't believe this!! This, this game is supposed to be good? OK, I play it, and, I get bored. And plus it's too hard to unlock the bonus features. This games STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!PS: Get Advance Wars!!! Ya, buy it. It's better, trust me."
4,An excellent game but I would like to see a sequel soon.,"Sonic Advance and Sonic Advance 2 are great games but are a little like the F Zero games in the aspect that you like the levels a lot but you just want more so you wish for a sequel and then when it comes you still want another one cause you like it so much but are slightly bored at playing the same levels over and over.I guess thats what keeps them from being true classics.A game like Super Mario World you dont really care if they make a sequel or not because that game is already a masterpiece.Same with Sonic Adventure.Still this game has bright colorful graphics and good music.Plus 4 characters.Its a lot of fun but you just want more,more more."
1,Beware!,Was looking for this at a lower price than in National Geographic catalog. Don't buy this! You can buy the same item for $36 from National Geographic! This seller is ripping you off!
4,great globe!,We bought this for our Godson who is 4 and he loves it! Great way to learn travel and distance at this age. It was important for us because he is in Arizona and we are in Michigan. Now he realizes why we only see each other sometimes rather than every day!
4,Great fun for Learning!!!,This is a very neat learning toy that both parents and kids can do together or the kids can do it themselves. It has several different learning modes that does an excellent job of teaching not just about different countries but cultures as well. I bought it for my seven year old son and he loves it and would definately recommend it to others!
2,Way disappointed...,"This toy is just not what I thought it was going to be like... It's a very cool idea that was not made up the right way... Unfortunately!!!.. it's hard to be used by a kid (even by an adult). I think they could've identified more countries to make it more fun.. they missed Central America!!!!!...(they missed 7 countries doing that, what a way to teach world geography!) besides they say people who are hispanics speak HISPANIC!!!.. that's not even a language.. It's spanish, and I think that even a kid can know better than that. If you're making a toy that will provide world geography the least that you can do is looking up the right information so you don't make this kind of mistakes. I'm from Ecuador and I speak Spanish. If you get this toy, please make sure you tell your kids that we are hispanics, but we speak SPANISH. Thank you!!!..."
2,Another poor VTech product,"I think I've had enough of VTech's toy products. This Fly & Learn Globe toy is another example of VTech's good idea, poor execution business model. The toy looks attractive at first glance, with a joystick, five playing modes, and several countries and cultures to explore and learn about. Unfortunately, the joystick is awful and hard to use even for an adult, let alone a small child, and the content is very limited, providing little replay value once a child has played through the five modes, which takes no time. The toy also feels flimsy. There's so much VTech could done to make it a worthy toy, but once again, they seem more interested in getting your money than providing a useful toy for kids."
4,Good first step in geography,"I bought this for a [...] I was able to show her very quickly how to use the gears and buttons to find the countries. After only a few times, she was able to find several countries on her own. The plastic seems a little fragile, so I'm not sure how long this will work, but for the price, it's a good deal."
3,It's ok,"I was really excited to get this for my 4 yr old dd last X-mas but she has never really played with it. It is very hard to navigate the plane and it doesn't stop when you reach your destination. Anyway, I would not recommend it. However, my 2 yr old liked playing with it but didn't learn anything...he just liked the plane!"
1,READ THIS COMMENT BEFORE YOU BUY,"THis toy is a waste of money. I am another who agrees w/ previous comments that it's very hard to navigate w/ the joystick (it's not very precise movement) ESPECIALLY for a child (3 year old- forget about it). as an adult, i had a very hard time getting it to land exactly where intended. I also noticed that, even though the desired location appeared to be inside the little magnifying glass, it would not read as such. good idea- but horrible execution. And NO- my batteries were not low- they are NEW! i think that previous reviewer who had absolutely no problems is suspect..."
3,VTech Fly & Learn Globe review,"Way too difficult for a tiny child with tiny hands to manage the ""airplane"" magfifying glass. ""Sites"" difficult for a grown up to determine, let alone a 3 year old. Would have been nice if they had made the states and countries identifiable. We do enjoy it even with these limitations. Just don't expect too much. I also think there should be more games....it is very limited in it's educational scope."
3,Hard to use,"This toy has really neat sounds and a lot of activities. The problem with it is that it is hard to control. The joy stick flops around, and it is hard to stop on the place you choose. It is hard for me to control as an adult, so you can imagine that a 4 year old has a really rough time. My doughter got so frustrated with it she just quit playing with it."
2,Great concept...make sure you get one that works.,"When I first heard of this..I thought it sounded great. As a mother and teacher, I couldn't think of a better toy. However, I did learn some new things. For example, the Pacific Ocean is right next to Europe (Asia doesn't exist unless you are lucky enough to hit the 1mm spot that the globe will register as Asia). There is only South Africa..the rest of the continent...nonexistant! I expect better out of Vtech! Oh well..another toy that looks great, but is a waste of money!Update: While in the store, I saw this again. I played with it while in it's box and it seemed to be great. Much more accurate. So, I returned my defective one for the new one. We've had the newer one for about a year now. It's great. My children like to toy..and it's educational. The toy registers the correct locations now. I guess we just had a defective one before."
3,"Good concept, but needs work","I bought this for my 6 year old niece for Christmas. When it arrived, I was disappointed. I ended up giving it to my 3 year old. She liked it, but lost interest in it. When my two nieces came over (the 6 year old and a 10 year old), they lost interest much quicker. They knew more information than the toy offered by what they learned in school. I think the concept is great, it needs more...more information about more places than currently offered. Back to the drawing board I say....."
1,Cannot recommend it,"The authors review a variety of journal articles, but their critical reviews are rather spotty and subjective. The introduction is fairly good because it gives an overview of critical issues in evaluating journal articles. It reminds us of various threats to the validity of a study, etc. I had to purchase this book for an advanced statistics class but I cannot recommend it."
5,Great product,This microwave is the best one I've ever owned. It is big and powerful. The exhaust fan has three speeds and the light has two settings. The only bad thing about it is the popcorn setting needs about 20 more seconds.
2,Died after less than 1 year,"The microwave worked fine until it completely stopped working after less than one year. I searched the web and found a few others who had the same problem, with no solution.Update: I fixed it by putting in a new 20 Amp fuse (from Home Depot). This took a few hours (especially removing and replacing microwave from under the counter). It's now working fine again. Apparently, fuses on this unit only last about 2 years."
5,very good microwave oven overall,"1- This microwave oven has good exhaust fan, quiet and move a lot of air. It also has turbo fan mode, which is noisier but can move a lot more air. I used outside vent.2- Using the microwave is simple for warming food. Have not use other functions. Inverter defrost should be good.3- mounting the oven is a bit more complicate than normal, due to the power cord adds thickness to the top of the oven. It requires to cut a 6 inches slot at the bottom of the cabinet, which is not difficult, but requires the use of a jig saw.4- The mounting arms made it easier to install, but looks flimsy.5- This replaces a Frigidair gallery Microwave oven, broken after 2 years in service. The matched Frigidaire range gives me many problems with intermittent burners, broken lighting switch/connection."
5,WOW this really cooks,"Not only did I get this incredible microwave for an amazing price from AMAZON and FREE shipping, this mirowave does everything it says and more. The install was very easy, (yes...you do need two people to install).Food taste better and heats and cooks much faster than any other microwave I`ve owned,plus it looks great!"
4,good microwave,I could not open the first microwave that I received but was promptly sent a replacement that works good. My wife doesn't like the push button opening but other than that it is an excellent microwave for the price.
3,"OK for a Debut, But Could've Been Better","I thought Sonya C's ""Married To The Mob"" was OK for a debut, but at the same time I felt it needed more songs than interludes (which was a disapointment). Some of her best tracks are: #10, #6, #4, & #2(wonder why it was a Radio Cut?). Understand this was the first serious No Limit release on ""In A Minute"", and Sonya was the first female rapper ever on No Limit.Other than that, if you are a Hardcore No Limit Collecter & happen to order or Luckly see it anywhere in stores Get it This Is A Must!!!, but if not I would'nt recommend it if you started bumpin' their Later LP's from when ""Beats By The Pound"" produced for them which was the some of the Tightest, Realist & Undeniably the illest music I ever heard (wish it was like that for No Limit today which is TRU-ly missed.... I myself don't really feel ""TheNewNoLimit Records""), but OWN Every Release from ""92-thru late ""99."
1,Another No Limit Artifact,"This album was when MAster P and his first original tank members started to get serious about their music. This album ""Married to The Mobb"", is actually Master P's wife SOnya C. There are too many un-needed interludes and Sonya really doens't have variety in what she raps about. C is really below average. With 11 tracks and 6 songs you might aas well borrow this from a friend. I suggest someone if they are lucky another to come across this to pick it up if they are a NL fan but other than that anyone outside this music genre of bloody average No Limit rap should look away from this."
2,To The Music Fan From Boston,"Find yourself a good shrink and tell him/her your problems, 'cause you got many if you let a music review mangle you like that! Who Cares?!I stumbled on this and realized it's not the correct CD I am looking for."
2,junk,Junk.... It work but is very very limited. No power control just excessively bright useless light. The only way to get a good photo out of this is to bounce the flash off a wall or diffuse it multiple times.
4,Intelligence flash,"I have a Dimage Z3 with a reasonable built-in flash, but still need another flash for other situations. I was very enthusiastic to find this one on Amazon. And after reading your reviews, I decided to buy one. The shipping was quick b/c I got it in three days. However, since my z3 hotshoe does not fit the flash, I have to use the wireless connection. The instructions about setting up the connection are straight forward and the flash worked like a charm after the set up. I put it in different angles, close and away from my camera and it worked every time. Remember to move the cursor from the N back to other settings or it won't fire. I used it with my Samsung 1050 pocket camera and it worked as well.I am very happy to get it and would highly recommend it.I would give it a 5 stars, if the shoe wheel were stronger so it could better be tightened to the bracket. I also think the battery cover is weak and would go sooner for someone who has to replace the batteries more often."
2,Gets old fast.,"I recently bought this game on Amazon because I remembered playing it a few years ago and loving it. That was probably the worst way to waste 1 dollar. The game is fun for about 10 minutes... after that, it's already repetetive. And if you're looking for an alternative to the Grand Theft Auto series (as I was), then keep looking. Kill civilians as you may, and no cops will ever come after you. You also lose points for every civilian killed. And don't get me started on the driving mechanics...I mean, if you dig being the big bad cop friskin' people on the sidewalk, by all means, purchase this game... otherwise, avoid at all costs."
2,game sucks get something that has had more time spent making it,I don't like the game at all the driving sucks really bad why don't thay take some tips from a game like flatout or something cuz the driving really sucks bad and theirs ghosts in the game thats so stuped I thought a grand theft auto kind of game but then theirs ghosts poping up thats dumb im glad I paid $4 for it only or I would be mad I say don't buy it get a game thats been make better the graphics suck to the only thing I like is the kung fu fighting and cuffing people on the street so I say forget this and get a grand theft autofean
3,Its Okay,I played it and it was alright.Its not really as good as gta.My brother loves it though he thinks its like 10 times better then gta.But if you rather play as a cop then a mafia member then get this.This is great for people who like playing as a cop but not who play as a mafia member if u wanna play as a mafia member get gta or of course mafia but if you wanna play as a cop get this although you can play as a dirty cop.
3,whoopa$$!!,Just drive around LA causing mayhem and stopping crime. Controls suck and there are a few glitches. Fun overall. The Chris Walken voiceover is excellent.
5,Love this game!,Brought back great memories from years ago. Game came in perfect condition. Played very well with no skipping or defects. Would recommend to friends!
3,Great game,Its very cool. but the graphics aren't so good but its old i understand. The game length is very very short. But I love driving around until a crime starts.
2,Don't even bother,"I tried this game 4 times. The controls and handling are difficult at best. In several efforts to stop the ""random crime"", I ended up killing civillians. Every time I ended up a ""bad cop"" BEFORE I even got halfway through the first mission. Compairing Vice City and this game would be like compairing a Ferrari and a Model T. Don't waste your money unless you just want to drive around a nicely detailed large city."
2,What went wrong?,"When i first heard about this game i was expecting a GTA rivalry but what the heck this game turned out not that good at all, the main character says the dumbest things and the gameplay isnt even that great."
4,Fun Game!,"This game is awesome! It's like Kung-fu fighting mixed w/ max paine, GTA and need for speed all in one! The missions are fun and theres almost endless gameplay. You can complete the set missions or bust street crimes. If you like the mindless GTA style bloodbath then theres some of that too! You can go on killing rampages w/ the awesome bullet time(Max Paine,Dead to Rights). You can roam around the city of LA while jacking citizens cars and speeding around corners causing chaos. All of this of course will give u a bad cop rating. But you can do good deeds(busting criminals w/ out killing them and not killing civilians)to earn a good cop rating. The graphics are average(cmon,2d trees!?)and the music is cool. Most of the game is very realistic untill you get to the later levels. Dragons, Zombies, Magic? Last time i checked this wasn't a fantasy game. I guess i've talked enough so i'd just like to say 1 more thing... Buy this game! Tons of fun!"
3,True Crime is.........................,"True Crime Streets in LA is a your average LA Cop game. If there where any others, But the Sequal should come out this Hoilday Season. Anyway There are goods and bads to the game lets start with the goods. The graphics are nice and a huge map to play with. The moves are cool. And if you dont want to do the missions you can allways help out with the crime in LA. I Loved the soundtrack to True Crime. It had all your favorite Like Lil flip lil mascare and all thoses Bling Bling Bitches. The negitive is your character is a real dick, He thinks he funny but is a real loser. And the moves are old and crapy. Instead of getting this get Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. Pretty much this game is a bad coppy over of the GTA Seris. I give it 3 Stars"
3,true crime,i think this game was all right and could have been better for all the time was put in to it it sould have been better way to big of an area for me and not split up enouf for me basicaly streets of la was all right and may be bout by idiouts every wererock over london rock on chicago
4,Good for what it is...,"True Crime is very good for what it is, GTA for LA. As a parent, I think the language and theme is a little aggressive for my children but as an older gamer I enjoy the sights and sounds of LA as much as anyone. I don't recommend this to folks who are not ready to brawl in strip clubs or open fire on pimps. I do recommend this game to those who really like the free play feel of GTA with nice graphics and in a city we all know and love...Controls are ok, graphics are great, soundtrack is great. I've just picked up the GTA double pack which looks a little better than on xbox than the PC version that I've played before. I think True Crime is a good update to GTA and worth getting if you want the same style of play but from the Cop side of the spectrum."
4,nice job music sucks though,when true crime first came out i quickly rushed to get it. i had seen a lot of screen shots and heard a lot of things from this game so naturally i bought it as soon as it came out. but when i got home to play it the first thing i noticed was the soundtrack. it was jam packed full of nothing but mindless rap music. nothing but rappers only two or three good songs from bands like the deftones and unloco but other then taht nothing but rap. so i found it fortuate that i purchased the xbox version. the game was good the stealth missions were nice but the only thing was the frustrating hand to hand combat that got annoying. it was made too difficult and i only got passed it by sheer luck. but other then that the game makes for a nice version of GTA not to be compared becasue this game is great in its own leauge
3,YES it is a GTA wannabe,"I won't bother you with details because too many have written reviews already. Bottom line is: True Crimes IS a GTA ""wannabe."" It does have its own ups and downs. I had fun with it, but the fact that the final fight requires you to master a fighting system that is absolutely terrible was a big disappointment. I was hoping for something better. You can't judge a whole game by its ending, however, so I give it 3 stars."
2,"Close, but not close enough...","The fighting system in the game was absolutely horrible. You have a one-two punch or kick that's not very effective when you're fighting. The computer has way more powerful punches and kicks that drasticly bring down your health. The only way to damage your opponents is to hit them with a special attack when they're stunned (GOOD LUCK ACHIEVING THAT GOAL). I won't totally bring down True Crime, since there were some good things in the game: Roaming the city and stopping steet fights was fun, frisking people for drugs, guns, etc., and rescuing people from kidnappers. One more thing I could never understand in gun fights -when you give someone a headshot, the game takes a point off your Good Cop Meter. This is ridiculous. The game has an excellent soundtrack from Snopp Dogg, N.E.R.D and other rap artist to keep the game moving. So this game by far wasn't that great -but only a good keeper."
1,"A cheap, clichéd copycat of GTA","Within the first minute that I saw the trailer for this pathetic piece of trash I was so upset. True Crimes take the idea and vision of GTA and throws in a weak, corny plot, horrid soundtrack and a clichéd bullet-time game play. Sure the graphics may be looking great and the destruction is fun for the first few minutes and then you get tired of the garbage. It's a down right shame that people actually like this crap over GTA: Vice City; awarded Best Action Game in the VGA awards. If you want superior action I highly recommend GTA 3 and GTA: Vice City. Both of those games combined are extremely addictive and exceptionally fun to play. Don't waste your money on this cheap P.O.S. copying, clichéd game."
4,True Fun,"this game is chill. buy if for sure. yeah, it may have bad camera angles it's still chill, buy this game."
3,A-W-S-O-M-E,This Game is the best game i have ever played in my life.People say the controls are hard but they are so easy. I learned them in 5 minutes.I paid $50 And it was worth the risk. Gameplay is awsome and the graphics are super.Its nothing like Grand Theft Auto And Thats What Makes it soooooooooooo good.Awsome Game. Buy It
5,Fantastic!,This is a wonderful CD with music we've all grown up with and are familiar with. I will be ordering two copies as it is good enough to pass along to listeners of good quality music. Generally I find that many old favorites are written by artists people think they don't know. That would definitely be the case with this CD. Some of the songs on here I didn't even realize were Gershwin songs. It was a fluke to find this and it has become a household favorite.
5,Must have for your Collection!,First off I hafta admit I goofed years ago.When this first came out I got Vol 2 and not Vol 1 to go with it.Few weeks ago I finally located Vol 1 here at Amazon.VERY hard to find now and hats off to Amazon for having Used resellers!As for Bernstein....what a fabulous Composer/Conductor!His work is a must have for any Classical Music Cd Collection!!His Theater Works are just super.This complete set by Sony very well presented and recorded.Bernstein truely added to Classical Music History and very much missed with His passing.Don't do what I did....IF you can find Vol 1 and 2 get them both!!Don't be surprised if you hafta hunt for them because they are getting harder and harder to find.This part of Classical Music History is a real plus for any Collection!
2,It blew my amp?,"There must be a polarity issue that I was not aware of, but using this & the loss of the sub-woofer in my amp seemed to coincide... Who knows..."
2,not all created equal,"Although the product (compression shorts) fit and basically were acceptable I still have one major problem with them. there is no waist band to speak of and the shorts will roll down creating an uncomfortable wear. I bought two pair and wish I could exchange or return them but I realize that is not acceptable with such a product. In short, I will not buy this brand of compression wear again."
1,Received Wrong Item,"I bought a Tom Jones DVD which I never heard of Cronica and received a Nirvana DVD. I emailed the seller Movie Mars, Inc. and never heard back. Please send me what I ordered and paid for. Thank you."
2,Doesn't have the stars!!,My daughter wanted this snow globe for her birthday and was very disappointed. She wanted the snow globe specifically for the gold stars that appear in the picture. This globe does not come with the gold stars. I am sending this globe back today.
1,Care Bear Snow Globe,I also ordered the snow globe for the stars and was very dissapointed when I got it. I too am sending it back and am very dissapointed about the purchase. The gold stars are what made it different.
1,B-A-D,"This movie is one of the worst i have ever expirienced. The dialogue is so incredibly sheesy, it made some of my high school productions look like masterpieces. The animation is better on saturday morning cartoons, and the minitures vary is size so much, it is confusing. Every fighting scene is basically the same and and it follows no clear path of logic. This movie is not worth even renting."
2,boring,"I have been an life time fan of aliens Godzilla and dragons and dinosaurs that is why my reviews like (The valley of gwangi the beast from 20,000 fathoms Godzilla tokyo sos ect).But those at least look real but this is a Godzilla rip off and an excuse for a monster movie the acting was okay Yonggary was so weak agagist Cycker and a guy said Godzilla was weaker than Yonggary WRONG! dont get this unless you are gonna waste your time."
2,Extensive monster scenes,"This is a poor film in almost every regard, but I admired that it didn't skimp on the monster destruction footage."
3,Remake,"This movie reminded me alout about the old Godzilla movies with a new story and new effects. Its just as good in my opinion and if you like godzilla, go and see it, if not. You wont Like It."
2,ALMOST DOO DOO,"In watching REPTILIAN, you'll have to ignore the horrendous acting, and snicker at the so so special effects. At times, it almost looks animated like a cartoon and other times it howls back to the days of the fifties. And all of a sudden, Yongarry decides he wants to help us out, too! Only if you want a good laugh will this howler entertain you!"
4,A Good Monster Movie,"If you are a fan of ""Citizen Kane"" and/or Julia Roberts, avoid this movie like the plague. However, if you enjoy a good monster movie every now and again, this movie is for you. It has all the essentials: delightfully wooden acting, good special effects, and a storyline that allows for not one, but two giant monsters, as well as some ultra-cheesy aliens. In all, it's a good way to spend a rainy afternoon."
1,reptilian,Never received the item from the seller. Seller has not communicated with me after numerous attempts
3,Very chilling story - an important contribution to history,"There was a lot of intrigue keeping the eternal city whole. I felt the author did a good job of discussing the events that were central to the story, the struggle of the church to stand up to the Nazi's as best they could without bringing bombs raining down on the city. Should they have done more--undoubtedly yes. But lives saved are important. I enjoyed the writer's style and research"
5,excellent cable,"Excellent cable, I used it just for a few days, my house was stolen and they took everything. But it is a very good cable."
2,Cheap,"I have not tried to use them, but the plastic packaging had come apart from the cardboard when I received it and the part was loose in the box. That isn't a huge problem except the product itself is cheap and not very good material. I have not used it because I want to return it for a solid product. The rubber seems to be not connected too well to the 'metal' part. It might be good, but I don't want to find out. Sound is important for filmmaking so in that department cutting corners has to be avoided. Might be good for simple connecting, but I don't know"
2,Baby Doll Tee,"This item is a baby doll tee-shirt; not a regular tee. Therefore, it runs extremely small and tight-fitting. I expected it to be fitted, but this was very, very snug. FansEdge does have quick delivery."
2,alright but not great,opm. great band but not this cd. its not there usuall rap rock punk. its slow rock cheesy lyrcs. buy their other cds.way way bettersorry opm
4,Nice return from OPM,"California Poppy is another fine album by OPM. I really like the more organic style, which showcases all of the band members musically. The only negatives about it is that it`s too heavy with the smooth laidback songs and lacks the really catchy songs like Rollin`, Heaven Is A Skatepark, and Perfect Day. I love the laidback mellow songs as much as any OPM fans, but California Poppy would`ve been better if it had more uptempo songs like Lion`s Pride and Born Again Virgin. Still regardless California Poppy is a very good album. If you`re into more funky, laidback music to chill to, then this album is for you."
1,File under: sucks!,"First off, I made a major screw up today by buying this CD 'blind'. Normally I won't take a chance on a new CD unless it is by a band I already know to be good, and sometimes even then I won't purchase until I check them out at Amazon or on LimeWire, etc. Secondly, although OPM appears to have been around for awhile I can only assume their earlier releases were better? Being a big KMK fan I noticed they were on the same label and decided to give em a try. BIG MISTAKE. These guys try to look all hard on the back cover sitting around a table littered with drugs and guns but turns out their music is about as hard as 2nd grade math. Is this a 311 or Sublime tribute band? Total crap! It has no funk, punk or edge which most other SubNoize bands bring to the table. It's not even good stoner rock. A collection of worthless wanna-be raggae ballads. Might make a good frisbee though."
4,very useful and detailed,"John Sander gives a very detailed look at Western New York lakes, streams, rivers and ponds. If you ever passed a body of water and wondered if there were fish in it, this book will tell you what you need to know."
5,GREAT book!!!!!!!!!!,"has advice in it for baby on up to adult, in order. great little coffee table book with advice that is simple and sweet. great new parent gift! love just opening this up and reading it from time to time!"
2,Useless words,"I found these bits of so called ""wisdom"" completely obvious and some a little offensive. ""Be a good wife. You're shaping their future relationships with men""? Really? Of course, I'm a good wife if my husband is a good husband. What if you're not married? It like mothering tips from cosmo magazine."
2,radio doa,"i been having a hard time finding a replacement radio with ""shafts"" for my 81 pontiac.....i cant even find one at the junkyard. 30 bucks seemed like a good price even if only the radio part of it worked. the radio i purchased arrived on time, but it was not the one pictured, some hardware was missing, the cassette door broke, and the instructions were for another radio. then when i tried to power it up, nothing happened. 2 hours wasted taking the dash out and ended up putting the old one back in. i would have returned it, but for thirty bucks i will just chalk it up to experience. whats really upsetting is a non shaft radio costs a lot more than the radio that came with the car. the shipper seemed willing to resolve the situation, but only after taking pictures of the alledged radio mix up and probably needing a rma order. i am more disappointed than i am angry. i likely will just have a new one installed."
4,I like all the Darkover books,"Darkover is such a believable place. The characters are well written. People there are telekinetic, telepathic, and precognitive. What an interesting concept. Wonderful."
5,Kill the Green,Works good! It keeps the green at bay in our tank. Hasn't harmed any fish. My ornaments are clean. What else is there to say about this product? It does what it in intended to do.
1,Not satisfied,"I tried this product immediately. It caused my aquarium to cloud up far worse than it already was, the algae has not gone away. This product is not something I'd ever purchase again. The algae is out of control not under control."
5,Works like a charm,"I started out with white, cloudy water which then turned to green, cloudy water. Tried this and it cleared things right up. No problems. The green stuff came back a couple weeks later so I tried it again with the same result. Highly recommended."
3,Classic 'Who-Done-It' Murder Mystery,"This middle book of the Caliban series was a classic 'Who-Done-It' murder mystery along the lines of 'Caves of Steel'. Elijah Bailey could've been in there instead of Alvar Kresh. This book served more as a segway between Caliban and Utopia. It essentially moved Kresh into the Governorship of Inferno and that's about it. Its not the strongest book I've ever read. Although I'd suggest reading all three, if you had to skip any book in the series, it would be this one."
2,Weakest of the trilogy,"'Caliban', the first in this trilogy, is a good book and well worth seeking out, so is the third one, 'Utopia'. This is easily the least of the three. Although Allen tries to expand his examination of Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics by introducing New Law robots the concept is not done with any verve, pace or excitement. As noted by another reviewer it has an Agatha Christie feel to it but without the charm or style of her mysteries. It's not even a particularly interesting puzzle. There's nothing in this middle book that can't easily be caught up with in the third. And the concept of Three Law/No Law and New Law is better examined there as well. You really don't need to spend the time on this one."
2,"The sequel should have been better, but was not","While the murder mystery was well set up, the ending was more of Agatha Christie ending, with a parlor room scene and a head shaker of a perpetrator. The political intrigue which should have been the height of this story was not focused on well enough. This is a society in the grips of an awful set of diriving forces that should have rocked the foundations of the planet. But you didn't feel that pain from the governor. The 4 law Robot introduced isn't given the same exploration that Caliban was in the first book. You do not get behind his head. The pain of transition should have been brought to bear hear as their are real world examples all around us. This missed the boat."
2,I feel sorry for Isaac Asimov.,"If he were alive to see what Allen did to his Robot Universe, he would strangle the guy. This is a perfect example of why Allen should've stuck to those Little House On The Prairie sequels. The basic idea of Inferno (Just like it's predecessor, Caliban) is the creation of two new kinds of robots: The New Law robots and the No Law robot, and their effect on the society of the planet Inferno. The New Law Robots are freer than the original Three Law robots in Asimov's books, but have their own share of problems; Caliban, the only robot created with no laws, is of course the most free, but is far from human. This is all well and good, and in a more capable writer's hands would have been interesting, but Allen takes his one or two good ideas and throws them in a turbine. I'm sorry, Mr. Allen, but I don't really care about the intimate details of Tierlaw Verick's body, or anyone else's, for that matter. Whatever happened to ""don't tell, show""?"
3,Spanish cinema can be better,"In contrary to other spanish gay theme movies, ""Bulgarian lovers"" will not find its place in my dvdteque. I enjoyed it less than, for example, ""Bear cub"" or hilarious ""Chef's special"" (not to mention some Almodovar's works). And I ain't going watch it again.It is not a piece of bad cinema, don't get me wrong. I am pretty sure a lot will regard it as a funny and witty movie. But to me the plot seemed noting special, thus my rating is just O.K."
5,"Hot, Sexy and Fun!!!","Oh yes!!! belive me, you will love this movie. nice story line, good acting and if you like nudity (and we know you do) you will like this movie"
3,An OK game,"This game is ok. I got it with my xbox and thought it was really good. YOu are always in a vehicle and very few times are you a jedi. The storyline isn't bad but it is hard. The multiplayer is pretty good. but with some vehicles, even if you aim a bit off, a blind guess sometimes destroys the enemy. the graphics arent spectacular but passable. Doing the academy thing was pretty fun even though it gets soooooo hard that me an my freinds hav to hide in caves from the enemies."
2,Lucasarts' first mess up...,"Ugg, what can I say thats good about this game? Not much I'm afraid. The game play is weak and dull. The story is weak and dull. The multiplayer is weak and dull. The graphics are OK, but the cutscenes are horrible. The voices are ""fakey"" plus the dilouge is weak. The multiplayer is basicly whoever can fire rockets the fastest, wins. Very boring.Gameplay: 3/10Graphics: 4/10Multiplayer: 2/10Sound: 4/10Overall: 4/10I am very disapointed with Lucasarts this time..."
2,1-30 in a snap,slow down there are 2 many start wars games out i tiered of looking at them when im looking for some good games to buy...Since its been like a year and there are like 10 star wars games out i can imagone not alot of time went into making the game so the graphic are lacking as well as the creativity of the games play... i never liked starwars alot but since your making money (i think) i give you 2 stars...
2,Dust Catcher,"This game has absolutely NO replay value. There's nothing more to do after you beat it, unless you count the XBox Live version, which you shouldn't, because that itself is pretty bad. You are able to unlock a few things, like new multiplayer stages, videos, and a ""cd player"" (songs from the game, classical music mostly). The videos are just the ones from the game though, and although they're XBox quality, they're really not worth it unless you're some extremely hardcore Star Wars fan and can't miss out on the storyline. If that's the case, I feel for ya. If not, get a different game, or don't blame me if you find yourself trying to sell it right after you beat it (which doesn't take long at all.)"
1,Not what I ordered.,"I played the gamecube version of this game when it first came out, and really enjoyed the game. I decided to order the xbox version of this game so I could play it on my xbox 360. They sent me the SW:CW/Tetris Worlds version which was not what the description said it was, and is not able to play on an xbox 360 consol because of the xbox 360's motherboard. Needless to say I was angry when I got it, and it wouldn't play. The shipping was really slow too. Great game, bad deceptive service."
2,Was expecting more,I got this for christmas along with my xbox =) I was so excited at first I loved it but then my interest faded I play splitscreen with my 7 year old sister sometimes its really fun.I like the game where you take those building build turrets and have soldiers 1 player is just ok got stuck on a hard level and can't beat it. Personaly I would buy battle front 1 and 2.
2,gets kinda boring,"okay, this game (sadly) can amuse you for a couple of hours each day for about a week. then, boredom strikes. it's pretty easy and well...gets old. plus, there are no good cheats for it on the net. i give this game a well deserved 2 stars because even though it may seem fun for about 45 seconds...it gets frustrating and boring. don't buy this game unless you are a hardcore star wars fan, and if you LOVE driving around in a cruddy vehicle. the only reason i got this game is because it came with the XBOX when i got the XBOX. so, if your thinking of buying it, and you don't really LOVE star wars...click ""back""the main problem with this game is that it is mostly the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.graphics are semi-goodgameplay gets old but still semi-goodso in conclusion...dont buy this thinking you will like it for more than a two-week period or two.um...that's all.cheese."
5,My favorite album,"This is my favorite album to listen to in every mood. Kate Wolf's voice is true and honest. She sings mostly her own stuff and the mood goes from exuberent to pensive. This was recorded for the program ""Live at Austin City Limits"" and like all good live albums includes the audience as participent in the music. Kate Wolf is under-recorded as a songwriter, but this album highlights some of her best stuff."
5,KATE WOLF THE ANGEL OF FOLK MUSIC,"I have been a big fan of folk music ever since the ""hootenanny"" days back in the early 1960's. I don't know how Kate's beautiful voice and compelling lyrics passed by me but, they did, until just a few months ago, when I heard her song ""Green Eyes"" on ""The Village"" on XM radio. It was an immediate hit to my musical sensibilities so I purchased her CD ""An Evening In Austin"". Her music is so melodic and her lyrics are so universally meaningful that I regret not having known of her when she was alive. The world lost a gem when she passed on but fortunately she lives through her recordings for the world to continue enjoying. Thank you, Kate."
5,Thoughtful and honest music,"I'd heard a couple of Kate Wolf's songs on the ""Folk Sampler"" radio program. ""Carolina Pines"" was the hook, and now I have most of her recordings. I'd say that this live recording is a true gem. This CD has brought together all the qualities of what I enjoy in music. The sequence of songs flows with the artist's masterful rendering of imageries, pure voice, thoughtful reflections, emotional honesty, and tranquil yearning. Moreover, some between songs comments by Kate Wolf add a personal touch. This would be at the top of ""if I were stranded on a desert island with a CD player"" list."
4,Heart of God!,"John has really captured the heart of God in this album. Rarely have I ever been so exposed to the Father's love for the lost and the dying. If you want to purchase more than a song, if you want an experience . . . I stronlgy recommend ""Prayer for Boldness""!"
2,Not One of Brahms' More Memorable Works But Great Sound Quality!,This DDD mastered disc sounds very good as far as classical cds go and I don't doubt the pedigree of MTT and the LSO but I do question the choice of material which although is good and yet is not great and it leaves me wondering why one would assemble such great talent to cover this and not some other better Brahms work. Rather forgettable cd and not really worth the dough. Save your money for the MTT versions of Stravinsky instead.
3,Repetative and not for small children,I bought this game about a year ago.I thought the game was allright.It is kind of repative and has lots of puzzles in it.There are several levels where you have to slide blocks around to form a picture.I do not like these puzzles and never have.You do basically the same thing in each level but sometimes it is switched up a bit by changing characters.My four year old daughter likes it(but can only play the first few levels)This game is not for small children but if you like puzzles and mazes then you will probably like this game.Not for everyone but not a terrible game.
2,Not That Great,"My family and I LOVED the movie Finding Nemo, and I *finally* got around buying this game for my son (age 8) the other day.Unfortunately, he has had to call me into the room *repeatedly* to help him get through some of the levels. He gets frustrated and visibly upset (surely all that adrenaline isn't good for kids?!) and it was making my heart race, too. Most of the sections (he's on Level 6) involve a race of some sort or going through 2D platforming mazes (think Crash Bandicoot).Some of the graphics are truly excellent, but not for small children. There are scenes with Bruce the shark chasing and trying to eat Nemo and Dory as you navigate them through minefields and in the sub. The music sounds pretty threatening, too.Personally, I love PS2 games aimed at kids (e.g. Ice Age 2, Curious George, the Spyro series, etc.), but this game is repetitive and aggravating. Fighting against the current for some of the games makes it difficult and frustrating...which is decidedly unfun."
1,Frustrating,"This game is rated E for everyone and is targeted for a younger audience. My son is eight and has great difficulty in many areas. My daughter is six and can't play it all. And because you have to go all the way back to the beginning of a level when you quit, we often leave the game paused and turn off the t.v. so we don't have to lose what progress we've made. I don't reccommend this game for younger children. Save it for the older kids."
3,underwater adventure,"finding nemo is based on the disney movie coming out this summer where a father fish is sadly separated from his young one. Embark on an adventure as you search the ocean world for the young fish as you encounter many obstacles along the way: sharks, whales, and even dolphins. For all you disney lovers out there you might want to try this game."
3,"impressive graphics, mediocre play","My 4-year old son went through his little ""Nemo phase"", so of course we had to try the PS2 game out. Here are the good and the not so good....PROS--Graphics are top notch. Characters are instantly recognizable. Lots of movie footage.--Sound is impressive as well; the voices are here and so are the sound effects.--Lots of different challenges; game appears to be pretty lengthy.CONS--Play control can be a little awkward, so the kids may get frustrated.--Annoying amount of loading, plus the load times are pretty long compared to other games. The price one pays for all the footage put on the game.--Challenges are a little too challenging at times for youngsters.BOTTOM LINETry this game as a rental or pick it up used."
2,Cute graphics-slow loading,"This game was a little disappointing. Slow loading time. Tiring levels, especially chasing Dorey. Wish the game had a little bit more adventure in the levels without the time limits."
2,Horrible loading problems,"This game would be kind of fun except for the loading problems. They are horrible, it takes forever to do anything on this game because you are waiting so long for it to load. Can you sense my frustration!!! I hope everyone rents before they buy this and see if they can stomach it! The graphics are good so that is why I give it a 2."
1,game didnt work,"I would not recommend buying thru this company. I bought this game. Paid for game and shipping. It didnt work. I tried lightly cleaning it and even tried a different ps2. It would not play. I contacted them and they told me they that to return this game and get a refund I would be in charge of shipping it back to them? I already paid to have a working game shipped to me! After a few heated emails they did end up refunding me the cost of the game. But they kept the cost of shipping. I would not buy from them again. they could send lots of none working games to ppl just to take there money- then when the customer pays the shipping to send it back, they can just send it out again to another unexpecting family!"
1,A very difficult read.,"This type of fictional literature has always appealed to me and I was anxious to read the book after recieving it from a friend. But I was really disappointed with T. Davis Bunn's overuse of cliches and trite phrases. I found it very difficult to enter into the action and have all of my senses enticed by the novel. For an excellent series on first century Mediterranean life, I highly recommend Francine Rivers' ""Mark of The Lion"" series, even though they are classified as ""Historical Romance""."
2,Get what you paid for,"The charger does what it's supposed to do but it doesnt stay put in my vehicle outlet. I have to push it in while it charges the phone. I thought all outlets were the same size (car lighter outlets). If you can drive and push in the adapter to charge your phone, at the same time, then this is for you. Otherwise go with the phone company brand car chargers."
1,Cheap!,"If you like this product because it's cheap buy at least two to make it worth your while. This thing only lasted about two months! And it didn't work all that well while I had it. Once again, you get what you pay for."
5,it works,i found out after i ordered this item that i wasn't going to need it for my project. looks well made and it works.
2,Generalizations and exaggerations,"""most"", ""some""... Facts need to be added to support her views, which is what her writings come down to... her views. Stick with other books if you are looking for the way to properly care for your little green friend. Check out 'Green Iguana: The Ultimate Owner's Manual by James W., III Hatfield' Hatfield relies less on shock value and exaggerations, facts are important."
2,"Not informative, don't waste your time","I have had an iguana for 6 years now and there is only one book that I have found informative and necessary. It is Hatfield's ""Green Iguana"". Kaplan's book is very cluttered and offers no real life information on how to care for your ig. Don't waste your money."
4,A New Friend,As a young man who grew up in California it was such a treat to discover Kate Wolf this year. I am amazed that I had never heard her before I ordered this CD. She was so talented and this effort seems to reflect the spectrum of her career. Well worth the price of admission...........I wouldn't skip one song on this work.
5,Kates Roots,"Kate Wolf was an incredible artist, who gave rise to a whole style of female country/folk vocalists, such as Nancy Griffith. The music is beautiful, her voice plaintiff and sad.Her work is generally out of print, and, so it must be obtained from used CD sources. Still, how lovely to hear her soft acoustic music, and enjoy wonderful lyric.For any interested in this style, or going to the annual music festival in Guerneville, California in her name, this is a must have."
1,"""DREADFUL""","To save readers of this review a lot of time and still be informative, I am going to quote the late Bill Cox, author of a splendid little book in the field of Earpiana, when he reviewed Ed Bartholomew's equally transparently biased diatribes on Wyatt Earp: ""Dreadful.""Anyone reading this book in hopes of being ""fully"" informed, would need to discover somehow that they must consult the basic sources quoted to determine if and how they've been twisted, and also have to consult much more to see what was ignored or submergedThe only people who would do that are ""researchers"" for whom this would be, at best, a road map to basic sources.For others, save your money. This is another author who seems compelled to pull down images of those who appear to have amounted to something, and Wyatt Earp did in a small arena which has secured lasting fame for him, despite the inevitable clay feet."
2,Three Strikes against this book,"1-It is BORING. Great bedtime reading. It will put you to sleep.2-Using selective evidence,it is heavily biased against the Earps3-Title is a misnomer; there is no documentation to speak of andnothing new which would justify this books' existence. Authoris a well-know Earpophile and does not present a fair, unbiasedapproach to Wyatt Earp, The O. K. corral Shootout or otherevents. Thanks to the editor, gone are the mis-spellings andtortured syntax but author's earlier book on WYATT EARP ispreferable to this revisionist version. 25 years to life!"
1,THE REAL WYATT EARP,THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH THE TIME TO READ IT PURE BULL HE SHOULD BE ASHAME OF PUTTING OUT THIS JUNK
5,THIS IS A BOOK THAT WILL GET YOUR SPIRITUAL TUMMY FED!,"EXCELLENT is the only word that I can think of for this book. It conveys all of the vital points necessary for spiritual growth that every believer should know and learn more about. Andrew Murray does a superb job of teaching you. Excitement will grow inside of you as you read this book. The Holy Spirit is revealed in these pages and comes alive to you! After you have read this book, you'll want to change your life, increase your relationship with Christ through His spirit, and then share with others what this book has done for you so that, hopefully, it will have the same affect on them that it had one you. This book will get your spiritual fire burning -- NEVER to become dim! Buy this book today and experience the fullness of the Holy Spirit in your life!"
2,VERY HARD READ,"This book is very hard to read. I have successfully made it 3/4 through the book, but it's because I have been forcing myself to continue reading. I do like some of the points the book makes, and think it has a wonderful message, just wish it was easier to read. Uses A LOT of big words that are not everyday words for the average person, which forces you to have to think longer on each sentence you read. Would find myself having to read the page 2-3 times in order to get the point. As said, it does have a great message, but I believe it could have been written as a better flow of words. I would only recommend this book to someone that is an avid Theological reader, not an average Christian looking to deapen their spiritual relationship with the Lord."
3,Holy spirit,"Hi, It is a short book and is well written...but I didn't come closer to the Holy spirit. It is worth reading...but didn't help me very much."
5,good stuff,"I tried these on impulse and cannot stop buying the things. They are really, really good. Verrry addicting!!"
1,What a Disappointment,"What performance of ""Giselle"" could be better than that danced by Alonso and Vasiliev? That's what I thought when I put this ballet performance on my Wish List.Received this ""Giselle"" DVD as part of an 80th birthday gift. Couldn't wait to play it.WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!! THIS PRODUCT IS ONE DISTORTED LONG BLUR. You cannot see any part of the ballet clearly. You know there's dancing, but you can't be sure who is dancing -- except for the wild applause for Alonso and, sometimes, for Vasiliev.Unless you're a snob who wants to name-drop and claim possession of this miserable DVD, don't buy it.I rated this as one star -- simply because I had to give it some rating. If I had a real choice, it would not receive even one star!!!!"
1,Disappointed,This version of Giselle cannot compare to the Baryshnikov Makarova ABT version available on VHS.
2,Condensed Ballet,"This DVD gave me the impression that the entire production was for the sole purpose of showing off Nureyev, most likely by Nureyev. What happened to most of Act I and great hunks of Act II? And the dance of the Willis was incredibly fast, particularly what we used to call the ""bacanall."" Hurry,hurry, so as to concentrate on Nureyev. Thank God they didn't do away with Myrtha. No, I would not reccommend this DVD, there are many excellent Giselles out there."
3,Reconstruction of history...that is the point.,"It is true that it is a reconstruction of a televised performance in Havana, in 1980, but at the same time you can buy it and have it, as a piece of art history, because this is history of the NationalAdam: Giselle [DVD Video]Cuban Ballet, and one of the best ""Giselle"" ever danced."
1,Why have to be sooooo bad?,"I don't believe in God (in any God) but I love the matter, I love how people fell about it, think about it and etc. So, although I don't believe it, I read about He and His rules... The problem is I always find books with poor information... That book is another one of them... don't waste your time"
3,"Not the real Merrick, but an enjoyable fictional biography","I believe this is one of the first books I've read that is based on the movie, rather than vice versa. At times it crosses the line into sentimentality, but romantics will take heart and a handful of tissues. Both the movie and the book condensed and misrepresented the real history of the real Elephant Man for dramatic effect. They also got his name wrong; it was Joseph and not John, but this is a common mistake attributed to his doctor's memoir. However, what Christine Sparks captures is the humanity of a man who was barely accepted as human, who in turn inspired others to view their own lives and the things we easily take for granted through his eyes. The earnestness of Merrick and his pure joy at the simple pleasures in life, like hearing the happy laughter of the nurses on the ward, remind the reader of how easy it to be distracted from enjoying life."
5,Heart Moving,This is one of the books which lets u reflect on the injustices that this world sometimes presents. It shows the people who are moved by greed and others that are moved by compassion. Elephant Man is a story which will make one think past appearances.
4,Touching in the most intense manner. Joseph DID feel!,"I was interested in this book the day it was assigned to me for a book report and I loved it. I expected it to start out slow, not reaching interesting boundaries until nearly the end but I was WRONG! This book gives us a detailed look into the life of a tragedy ridden man who had friends who were willing to work with him. A very touching book. It eats me up inside that at one time this man who felt more in his life than most ""ordinary"" humans do had to sell himself at a circus and be laughed at and gawked at. Merrick was no freak. Merrick was a human being. The ""Elephant Man"" label doesn't do this man justice. Such innocence for such an angst ridden soul. Only true stories can capture this much emotion."
5,The Most Touching Story Ever,"By far, this is the book I most enjoyed reading (actually I finished it in 2 days!). It is extremely touching and gives you a sense of warmth. The story of John Merrick made me realise how people should appreciate and make the most of what they have. I felt I was very much involved in the story and each chapter made me eager to read the next one. I look forward to read more books on John's life."
4,This book is wonderful!,"I've used this book for some years now, and always enjoy it. One has to be able to think laterally to get the messages, which stretches your mind and gives it some good exercise. Whenever I travel, I always take the book with me - I've used it so many times that I can pick up a deck of cards and pull one and know the general drift of what the card is telling me.I'm glad that Delle Fowler wrote this little book - I'd like to see more from her, bravo, Delle!"
1,My money back plz!,"I am so disappointed by this book. 1)It uses only one way to lay the cards ,2) you have to learn 7 x 52 different interpretations 3)you can't combine the meaning of each card together 4)it does not give any reversal meanings 5)the interpretations are not straight forward but rather from a parabolic point of view 6)the book is FULL of typographically errors 7)not for beginners. Need any more?"
5,Lost Kingdoms 2,"This game is an adventure game like no other. In the game your a woman that has a deck full of cards (not like yugioh). You go around levels with your monster cards and summon them to fight when enemies come and attack you, you can also summon them for the heck of it. In the game you can also buy cards and upgrade cards and evolve cards. The game is not to hard and its quit long, so thats a good thing. I'm a hardcore video game type guy but this one I love. Defenatly check this game out, you wont be dissapointed, and this one is just like the first one but with new monsters and some old ones to, better graphics, and new levels."
5,Relationship,"This game is alot like Yu-Gi-Oh!. If you are a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh!, then this game is definetly for you!"
4,Does what it needs to,"This works great with the Michael Kelly Hybrid Special guitar. There's an occasional pop if the Y cable is bumped, so I don't think I would use it outside of practice."
5,A powerful book with outstanding perspective,"The quality and truth of this book shocked me. It talked of experiences in the exact way that I myself would explain them, except with a professional yet warm perspective. I could not put it down from the moment I started it. I would recommend this book to people going through such trauma as well as people looking for inspirational and enlightening reading material."
2,Definitely not for sufferers,"I got this book without reading the subtitle (Strategies for Family and Friends). I thought it might help me with Binge-Eating problems. It didn't. In fact, I got very bored. It was sickeningly boring and only discussed how to handle things if you weren't really all that involved.First of all, it's my experience with any kind of mental health problem that you can't give a person help if they don't want the help. They have to make a conscious effort to choose to get help. This book somewhat bypasses this whole thing.Second, it states what you typically see in an Anorexic -- loss of weight, not eating, etc. Okay, who doesn't know this? If you didn't know this, then you probably wouldn't be picking up the book in the first place.I really don't think this book would be helpful if I had a friend or family member with an eating disorder. It's very unhelpful in my personal opinion.Skip this book!"
2,Not for sufferers,"I know this book says it is for Family and Friends and it probably means that.I tried to read this book, as I have been diagnosed with Binge-Eating Disorder and am now having the beginning signs of Anorexia Nervosa. Let me tell you, it was VERY boring. I couldn't really read it. I've read self-help books before and books about psychology and this has got to be the worst.I'm sure it may be good for people who know very little about eating disorders, but you can learn more about eating disorders online."
3,fine,"its a bit cheap, but it will do for now... the end that plugs into the mic will eventually stop working.."
3,Does what it says.,Works well but feels cheaply made. I bought multiple just to make sure if it does go break I have a backup. I also wrapped mine with extra tape just to protect it more. It has worked fine for 8 months but would have liked to have had a higher quality item.
5,What Children Need,"This is music especially created for children with positive lyrics that lift them and build them up. I listened to it on a record frequently with my children and they agree it had a positive influence on them. Therefore, we bought it on a CD to continue to share it with children."
5,wonderful memories,I played these songs for my own children 25 and more years ago....this is a wonderful compilation of all the best Gaither music for kids...now I play them for my grandchildren! Great sing-alongs!
5,appreciate the reviews,"I am very fond of Masses but did not remember hearing this one. (61 years - it is hard remembering everything). It is well worth the experience though I can see what some mean by saying you should listen to it a few times to get used to it. I also bought a CD by Paul Hindemith at the same time to make a comparison between these contemporaries. I like the Sinfonia best, however, even though I bought the CD for the mass. I appreciate the reviews that pointed me in the direction of this performance."
2,No really up to snuff,"My son got this for a gift. The sides are not good for the cans, they fall out, nothing stays in its place, and it is very hard to clean, I ended up putting it in his closet, because it is more trouble than it is worth. I do pull it out if he just wants to draw, but for playdough, I would say it is a major dissapointment!!"
1,not worth it,"We received this as a present. Tiny areas collect every bit of play-doh, so I found myself having to constantly vaccuum it, once the pieces got dry. The height is awful- too short to pull a chair up to, too short to stand at, and too tall to sit on the floor! We ended up stooping over to play with it, and my 2-3 yr iolds back hurt doing it.The shelf underneath constantly collected other fun things like snacks, and you don't notice unless you check under it constantly. To top it off, playdoh was never ""out of sight, out of mind"" ( I love playdoh, but can't allow a 2 yr old to play with it all day by himself), so IU was constantly saying ""not now"" as opposed to when the playdoh could be put away at the end of play. Do yourself a favor, and instead invest in a set of table/chairs, and a plastic bin to store all the play-doh stuff!"
3,Good table but nothing more.,"It is a nice fancy looking table but the the slide ruler doesn't really work like it should and it difficult to be used by out 3 1/2 yr old and the playdoh handle is too hard for him to slide the ruler across for different choices. Everytime my husband and I push down on it, the handle comes off and it never breaks so it is durable but we have to put it back on. I feel you are better off just buying the smaller versions of playdoh sets unless you want the table itself for your child to play or draw on."
4,Playdoh Table,"I have been looking for an arts & crafts table for my two year old daughter. I purchased this one on sale, as it seemed to have storage space available for various art supplies. It is an okay table, easy to assemble, and my daughter likes to use it for doodling. Unfortunately, the storage space it offers is only of limited use. The round holes for playdoh containers are quite shallow and the containers fall out. The holes for crayons and markers are also rather shallow; the crayons and markers stay in, but it would be more useful to have deeper holes that hold a larger number of supplies. The tiny shelves in the table legs can hold only very tiny items. The actual play surface is also small, and the 'storage area' under the desk holds only a few sheets of paper. Given the limited options for art tables for preschoolers, I think this was an okay purchase, but definitely one to get on sale."
1,This is a waste of money!!,"We got this for my 3-year old who loves to play with Play- Doh. You can save your money and just buy the fun factory.. The table is a pain in the neck to clean because of the cracks and tiny spaces. The crayon and marker carosel are useless. The holes are too wide and not deep enough so they fall out. The handle on the factory pops off constantly, and the storage holes on the legs for the cans of playdoh, don't get me started, the cans are constantly falling out and landing on my childs toes. Play- Doh is great but this table is a piece of junk!!!"
2,What was HASBRO thinking??,"I bought this toy for my 4 year old daughter. It was easy to assemble. Most of the features are very difficult to operate. The openings are very small so Play-Doh gets stuck in almost every area of this table, making clean up impossible.The table provides shelves to stack your containers of Play-Doh, unfortunately, the shelves are too shallow so the containers fall off most of the time. The height of the table is also not right. It is too small for a chair, but too high to sit on the floor and use as a table. This toy is a total waste of your hard earned money. There are many other ways to enjoy Play-Doh."
2,What a mess,My boys (4 & 2) received this as a gift. The legs keep falling off and what a mess. They always played with Playdoh on my counters and I never had a problem. This toy created such a mess on the floor. It was very difficult to clean and to store all the accessories. Will be selling this at the next garage sale.
2,Not even worth the $20 bucks!,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing.The playdough cans doesnt stay in the slots provided. Try having your child put back the playdough on the side rack. That ought otta get them frustrated. And trying opening one of those playdough cans. They made it both child proof for both child and parent. The carrousel for the markers/crayons, the holes are way to big and not deep enough. The two creases they made at each end of the table just gives you more work, trying to fish out the dough. They also should have made a chair for this table. Your better off just using a regular table and buying tubaware for storing the playdough and whatever accessories you have."
2,Worst Toy Ever,"My son received this as a gift and played with it once. Play-doh gets stuck in the cracks, making it difficult to clean. The markers and crayons do not fit in the alotted slots. There are so many other things that are wrong with it. I should have returned it when I had the chance."
1,playnlearn84,"Not at all what i wanted for my kids. They forgot all about the play doh and stared to color, since the play doh was to hard to even roll. The play doh is hard to squish out of the only 3 places to play. I really expected more of this table. Not worth the money!!!"
1,Unhappy customer,I had to rate this item in order to submit my review but in actuality I never received it. This Play-Doh Imagination Station Table is a discontinued item. I have a 2 1/2 year old granddaughter who loves Play Doh and when I found the table I was very excited. Unfortunately I never received it. I ordered this products about a month ago and still have NOT received it. I have contacted Amazon and the seller and have been told several times that it is on the way. The seller told me it was an expensive shipment so it would take a little time to receive. I accepted that explanation but a month does seem a little to long. At this time I would just like a refund and I would not purchase anything again in this manner.
2,"Not very practical, but loved","I got this toy for my three year old daughter this holiday season. The cans don't fit in the holes or stay in the legs, or fit on the shelves. It's a pain in the neck to clean. The slide ruler doesn't seem to work to well, our fuzzy pupmer stem broke and falls off. Our extractor handle falls off all the time. The markers and crayons are a bit awkward and crayolas don't fit either. But in spite of that, she loves it. Maybe she'd love any old table and it truly is the play doh she loves, I'm not sure. But if you ask her, it was the best present."
5,It was a hit of a gift!,"The person who received this, said it was the best gift ever. It was a great feeling to hear that. It isn't often when I get so much praise for my choice of a gift."
4,Good but Raw,"The gun camera footage is taken from Luftwaffe training films for fighter pilots. Each engagement is preceded by information regarding it, but that is the problem. It is all written in German, therefore hard to understand. With a little effort, it seems to me that the company could have produced an insert translating the words, making it more meaningful. The accompanying music is all patriotic German marching music from the war, some with vocals, some without. The action is riveting, but unfortunately each clip is all too short. This is not the fault of the producers of the DVD, since it is all they had to work with. Despite the drawbacks, it is still an excellent product simply because very little axis gun camera footage survived the war."
3,who wrote the instruction manual?,"Watch is heavy, attractive, seems to keep excellent time, date function operation by must be deduced by trial and error, the instructions offered no help at all. Band is too large for my normal sized wrist, now i must pay extra to have it made the right size. good price but not a product without troubles Update: 11/09 Watch dead. First buttons stopped working to control second hand, now it is paperweight."
5,Another great CD,"Keiko never bores me, nor do I get tired of listening to her music. I'll add this to my collection of all her CDs and enjoy it just as much as those. Listen and maybe Keiko will take you on a journey somewhere beyond space and time."
2,Ok.....but,"I decide to try this album based on all the great reviews. The music is essentially just Jazz with piano; nice but nothing new. It had a little to much orchestration (for me) and not enough spotlighting on Ms Matsui's keyboarding. If you've listened to a fine piano artist like Bob James, then you've heard music very similar to Ms Matsui'salready. It was ok, but nothing memorable (IMHO)."
5,Most Amazing CD I Have Ever Owned!,Keiko has won my heart w/ Walls of Akendora. The soothing sounds have really touched me in such a way to say that this is the greatest album I own by far.
1,Panzer General doesn't play on Win XP.,Panzer General does not play on Windows XP. I've been cheated by the vendor who said the game will play if you copy a file. What file? Where do you get it? It's all a lie to mislead you into buying the game. Alberto Nunez
3,"When I find Nemo, that kid's gettin' a whippin'!","The game is fun. the game is beautiful. The game will frustrate small kids. The biggest flaw with this game is that there is no easy mode - smaller kids (and non-twitch gamers like me) will get frustrated, because controlling the fishies is not as easy as it should be. There are 4 main modes of play. 1. Side scroller style, 2. Towards the camera, 3. Away from the camera, and bouncing on objects. Minigames are tile puzzles, memory puzzles, and bouncing (either on objects or pushing the luxo ball around.) You'll also have to swim through rings, collect and deposit pebbles, and defeat hazards by popping bubbles to collect ""stars"" on each level. Collect all the star bonuses on a level, and beat that level's mini-game, and you'll unlock conceptual artwork extras. The voice acting is either the talent from the movie, or remarkable ""sound-alikes."" I gave it a 3 out of five due to repetition and the inability to get past the jellyfish race..."
2,Too difficult for little kids to play !,"I bought this game, so my 5-year-old daughter can have a game that she could play by herself. After playing a couple of levels, she couldn't move on to next level any more without me playing for her. Don't be fooled by the title and cute graphics. This game turned out to be one of the hardest games I've ever played. It was harder than some of the mature rated.Its control scheme is rather simple, but the actual in game control is way too difficult to master for little children. The graphic is impressive, but sometimes it's too hard to control the characters in that pretty 3-D underwater environment. And also the game gets too confusing in some levels, and there isn't any in-game help.If you are looking for a game for your kids to play by themselves, skip this title. Unless you plan to play almost the entire game for your kids, so they can watch you."
3,Beautiful designs but just toooo hard!,"Ok I admit I dont have much time on my hands sometimes and I can spend a couple hours lost in a game, but this one just got to me. Part way thru I pretty much just gave up in frustration and turned the whole thing off. Yes, the graphics are amazing but it's just too hard for anyone to play. I suggest racing games or Shrek 2..That's a fun game!"
4,Hard for the Little Guys,This is a really cute game but our 5 year old would rather play Halo because it's easier for him! The fish are a little hard to move around and he gets tired of moving in and out of the same spot 100 times until he figures out how to move forward.
1,My mistake,I bought this game for my son but when it got here noticed it is an older Xbox game that won't play on his Xbox 360. My mistake. The seller was great and quick to get it to me it's my mistake foe not reading more carefully.
4,Challenging,"We thought Finding Nemo would be easy, but it was a little bit challenging, which made it all the better."
2,"Nice graphics & sound, but way too hard for anyone.","We bought this for our 5 year old son, the whiz of the Xbox. He's beat many many games - even more so than his dad or I. But this one was one of those games that none of us in the family could get past. There's something about how you move or swim that just wasn't set up right to where you knew where you were going. We very rarely ever get this game out - except to dust."
1,"Divisive, hate based radical gender feminist perspective of men.","I was appalled and offended by the hate based demeaning language used to describe men and the over all theme that men are inherently evil oppressors of women. I suspect this book is a response to the books entitled The War Against Men and The War Against Boys which actually promote healing and political reform from the wounds caused by feminists such as this who have taken control of feminism and the women's movement. This type of thinking causes nothing but hate, anger and pain."
1,Re-recorded should have been my first clue.,Even though the artists listed are the original artists the songs are by no name singers. The Betty Davis Eyes version is awful.
1,NOT the original artists!,Be sure and sample the audio tracks first! Each song sounds like a re-make of the original by some paid singer.
1,Nobody recognizable,"19 songs, I only recognized 3 of them. They must not have had the budget to license the real 80's one hit wonders. Don't bother, this is a waste of plastic."
5,"Educational, fun, and the art work is beautiful","My four year old son loves this book, and so do I. We live on a bluff and enjoy feeding the wildlife, both in the winter and summer. This book taught my son more about the animals that we feed, and encouraged him to ask questions about them. We both enjoyed the illustrations."
4,Hunter's Review,The Big Snow takes you through what animals go through when winter comes. The author of this book really showed his emotions on the pictures if you ask me. This book is great. You should read this book. The winter is very harsh and if not for two people they would have died. Will the animals be ready for winter?
5,The big snow,I attend West Virginia State College and I am taking a children's literature class this summer. The book teaches how animal survive in the winter. The pictures are beautiful and very realistic.
3,Bright Light makes the Palm IIIc difficult to see the screen,"I purchased a PalmIIIc for my wife. We live at in a ski resort town in Utah and play golf, ski and trout fish. The screen in sunlight, or avereage sunlight and snow make the IIIc difficult to use. I own the Palm VII and love it as the screen and adjustment feature and backlighting make the VII much more useable. Color is not worth it if you can't see it!!!!!!!"
2,"Very useful, but [price] dollar disposable item","I now have my second and last Palm IIIC. They work exceptionally well and quickly become indispensable in getting oraganized. The battery goes a week or more between charges with heavy use. The problem is, The screens have lasted me exactly long enough for the warranty to run out. I don't feel that I was rough with the stylus, but at the point that my whole schedule and several databases were in the device, the screen would stop detecting the touch of a stylus. I think I will wait a few years before purchasing another PDA, so that perhaps the touch entry will become more durable, or the prices will drop. I can't replace a ... device every two years!"
3,How important is color for your Palm use?,"You could justify the IIIC over the monochrome IIIs if you do a lot of work while 1)outside in the sun 2)in pitch black closets or other areas of total darkness 3)sitting in the back of a car or plane getting carted around without any lights on for a decent amount of time, 4) You need/really want gritty low-res color pics available on your PDA.I happen to fall in one of those categories, so it made sense to ""side-grade"" over to the IIIc. Otherwise, I'd say wait until this color functionality fits into the sleek bodyform of the Palm V."
4,A great product and fun to use,"I received the Palm IIIc as a gift one year ago, and I am very pleased with it. I have had little or no trouble with the unit (although it will occasionally shut down when the battery charge drops below half)and I find the color display easy to read. I strongly encourage that you order the Chrome program (you can find it on the internet), to allow you to customize the color settings. My only complaint, and the reason I did not give it 5 stars, was the difficulty in viewing the screen in bright sunlight. This is my first Palm product, and I have been very pleased in using it, and in the customer support from Palm. I recommend it to anyone looking for a Palm-based color product."
4,Color is wonderful!,"I had no idea how great this screen could look and what a difference color would make. I just want to turn it on all the time just to look at it. The main drawbacks are relatively slow processor (though much improved with Quickbits and FastCPU), can't expand the RAM, and 8 bit rather than 16 bit color. Pictures aren't great at that low resolution, but games look beautiful. My grayscale visor platinum looks quite utilitarian in comparison now. Have to admit that now with the price drop on the Visor Prism, that's a much better deal. But if you don't need the extra expandability and want an upgradeable OS, go for the IIIc. I love mine!doesn't get 5 stars because of the limitations and my first one was DOA but Palm replaced it in 2 days at no shipping cost to me as any company that likes staying in business would do."
4,Don't Drop It!!,"I got a Palm from hubby. Great gift! I used it to keep track of names, phone numbers, to-do's, birthdays, and Gifts (downloaded a program that kept track of who wanted what and what I've bought so far for whom). I could also download driving directions from mapquest.com. Awesome functionality!It was great UNTIL I dropped it. I put my bag on the counter in the restroom...the bag fell and the Palm screen cracked in several places, leaving it unusable. A friend of mine cracked his Palm III the same way. He also hasn't used it since or bought a new one. (Too pricey to buy each drop, don't you think?)So, whatever you do, don't drop it, even from waist-height.I'll be without a Palm until I can take anti-clumsy classes or until their less-breakable screens come out."
3,Palm IIIC -pros and cons,"A Palm is great if you're carrying around 20 postit notes of things that have to be done. The Palm's alarm will beep you, even when its turned off.I have to write certain characters (B, W, M, ...) very slowly for the Palm to recognize them, otherwise you get the wrong character. You have to changed the screen intensity when you move from the office to the car. Then it would reconigize nearly nothing. A call to technical support said you have to go back to ""Welcome"" and go through the routine of touching the screen where prompted, each time after you change to screen intensity. That worked, except having to still write certain characters real slowly. This recalibration is needed on the Palm IIIC and certain other models that they did not name."
3,"Nice color, but difficult to write on.","I have a Palm IIIe which I love! It has become indispensable in my work. I can write text with the stylus almost as rapidly as I can write on a piece of paper. That model, unfortunately, has gone out of production. Recently, a friend of mine bought the Palm IIIc. After testing it myself, I found it almost impossible to enter text using the stylus. I would try to write an ""M"" and it would come out an ""A"". An ""E"" would come out a ""C"". In fact, it took me forever to enter anything at all. I will say, however, that the colors are excellent. I just don't understand why the Palm IIIe should work so well, but this supposedly more advanced model should have this difficult."
1,No longer a happy user,"Until this week, I thought my Palm IIIc was the best product. That ended when I realized my Palm was falling apart. A corner of my Palm case fell off and is now not working properly. I called Palm and they will gladly fix my Palm for $100 (I have had the Palm for exactly one year). I can buy a brand new Palm IIIc for $299. I was preparing to purchase the new Palm 505, but have decided to look at the other brands available. This was a VERY expense toy for one years worth of work."
4,Great with 1 quirk,"I got the Palm IIIc for Christmas, and I have been very happy with it (admittedly, I have not been using it long, but I have given it an enthusiastic test drive). It performs very well, and the reviews I read before buying seem to have been accurate. However, I have noticed that the screen seems darker and more grey whenever I am somewhere with florescent lighting. I did not notice a problem with the display when I was at home, but at the office and in a department store I did notice a definate grey caste to the screen. At first I thought it was due to the protective film I put over the screen, but after removing it and checking again, my only explanation is that florescent lighting must affect the contrast.I do not want to discourage anyone from buying this great product, but other shoppers who are in the office more should be aware!"
5,Indispensible Toy,"The IIIc is not only just about the coolest toy ever, it immediately becomes indispensible. Unless size is critical, I would definitely recommend the IIIc over the Vx, as the color makes it so much easier to read and so much more fun to play with. The complaints you see about screen brightness are bogus. The display is plenty bright and clear and easy to read in all situations except direct sunlight. Perhaps the people criticizing screen brightness and image quality need to download Chrome and select a higher contrast color scheme, because I just can't understand what they're complaining about. Other great free downloads include Vindigo and Avantgo. If you travel, you will also love Travel Tracker, which I consider well worth the thirty bucks. After barely two months, I can hardly even imagine life without my Palm, and that's pretty much the best recommendation I can think of."
4,Definitely Worth the Money,"I bought the IIIc about a month ago. I love it! The color is very decent, with the ONLY problem being when I was in direct sunshine - then I couldn't see the screen at all. But, for me this is not an issue. The battery life has been great. I play alot of games on my Palm and I've not had to fully recharge yet. I definitely like having the color and am glad I spent the few extra bucks over the comparable B&W. The volume is adjustable, so playing games during biz meetings is not a problem. The Graffiti software is easy to pick up, however - I still have to write symbols on the keypad. Overall, the IIIc is very easy to use, I started using it right out of the box without having to use the manual. The color is great and the features are cool, too. I highly recommend this product. The only other product I would buy in lieu of the IIIc is a IIIc wireless."
1,Did not recieve all items from seller,"I was told i would recieve""Palm IIIc, lithium battery, synchronizing HotSync cradle, protective flip lid, battery charger, metal stylus, organizer software, handbook, Palm's Getting Started guide, and a DB-25 adapter"" all i got was the Palm IIIc And leather case, NOTHING ELSE. I am very disapointed with that, and expect to get ALL the items I PAID FOR."
1,What a Joke!,"I will give you a quick review of my Palm IIIc experience and let you make up your own mind.I ordered a Palm IIIc and used it minimally for two months when the screen went bad. I literally had to pound on it to get it to recognize commands. I returned it to Palm and after having one replacement get lost in the mail and waiting another week to get the second I got my replacement Palm IIIc.After 3 weeks with my new Palm IIIc, which in Palm's defense was working fine this time, I was sitting at my desk one afternoon with my Palm sitting in its charger. It started smoking and melting before my very eyes. Thank god I was sitting there or my whole house would have burnt down.Now I'm fighting with Palm who refuses to refund my money even in light of their product melting on my desk!My thought, I gave Palm two opportunities to get me a good product, they failed both times. I bought a Sony this time."
3,Good view but only 256 colors,"I bought it , the color display make Palm IIIc seems to be attractive , however , if it is compared with Handspring Visor Prism , it might lost , with 256 color display , it is not very useful for just Memo , address , the color display seems to be not very important , especially the To do list, even you set the Priority to be 1st , it won't high light it as red , so if you just use for memo and address or to do list , better use Palm Vx , Palm V , Palm IIIx or Palm IIIxe."
4,Great in the field!,I work in a rural area in Kentucky - I need a portable solution to keep track of stock. This little thing's as neat as they come and I like the games on it too!
3,ANSWER TO MY PROBLEM,"Color is great, nice hard cover feature (extra?) good deal for priceEasy set-up and connect to PCThanks---Marty"
3,Pretty useful,My son is the one using it. It works OK for what he uses it for. We had to buy a new battery.
1,PalmOne IIIc,PalmOne IIIc (Reconditioned) Worked very Good for a short period. Touch pad does not respond correctly to stylus taps. Very frustrating to enter info.
3,"Good color, but PALM now charges to repair defective units","The color screen is excellent, even better than the newest Palm M505, which I just upgraded to. I miss the bright, exceptional color. If you want a color Palm, this is the one to get!However, I must warn all potential buyers of a change in Palm warranty. I bought an additional Palm IIIc as a gift, and it turned out to be a defective unit. (Could never hotsynch in the cradle, only by infra-red.) I called Palm, Inc., this week and find out that the warranty changed in June. Doesn't matter when you bought it. Now all Palm III owners must pay $20 for repairing factory defective units, in addition to all postage. Palm, Inc., will not ""exchange"" the unit so be prepared to live without one until it is returned. Don't throw away your paper organizer! I don't know if changing the warranty after the fact is legal. My automobile maker would be sued big time if they tried!"
5,"A colorful, powerful Palm in a neat small package!","I find the Palm IIIc absolutely wonderful! It is stunning to view, and with the 8MB of memory I have plenty of room to write down/enter everything I might need. I am in the medical field and I use it for entering lab results, making treatment notes, jotting down phone numbers etc. It makes my lab coat pocket much less crowded than dozens of notes on tiny bits of paper! The color allows me to divide notes more easily - patients, professional, personal etc. I carry it everywhere and highly recommend it."
3,"Not really his Jazz stuff, more big band renditions","Title is misleading as this really is not a good collectionof Nat's jazz stuff. The tacky crescendo type background vocals reminscient of the 50's musicals are on several tracks and just hurt the ears when all you want to do is listen to Nat sing.If you want to here more of his jazz oriented music get the boxed the 3 disc set. Disc one is a great representation of the Nat King Cole playing jazz piano, the man is superb.There are a few of tracks that would actually count as jazz tracks""I was a little lonely and you were a little too late"" definitely fits the bill.Track 7 ""It's Crazy"" repeats. It appears they messed up the tracks on the burn and Track 13 is supposed to be ""This can't be love"" but it's track 7 again. Maybe this only happens on the standard CD layer (which is what I am listening to right now). Will check out the SACD layer and post and update later after listening that."
4,Worthy of Purchase,"As a musician and music lover, I have looked extensively for the right music for my traditional wedding ceremony with a couple of twists. So tired of the traditional bridal march, I chose Rigaudon as my entrance. This CD has good-quality sound, able musicianship, and 28 selections from which to choose. The organ is the best instrument in a cathedral to inspire the congregants. The bass tones are not too throaty, and the high pitches are clear, yet pleasing to the ear.This compilation is better than some others in that it is all played on organ, has so many selections, and the overall feel is regal and celebratory."
4,Wedding Album,"This album has everything you need to get you the ideas you need for prelude, processional or postlude music in a church setting for organ...strictly organ. Very well done. One of the few great renditions of Rigaudon I have heard."
4,Uggs at a fraction of the cost,"I have been wearing Uggs for the last 20 years. I like the product but I'm not happy with the price. Friends have purchased look-alikes lately and they seem to be fine. Upon arrival I found that these sheepskin boots have the appearance, feel and craftsmanship of Ugg Ultras. As stated in the reviews they do run a bit small so I ordered up one size and they were still a tiny bit short. I am pretty confident that once I wear them for a while they will stretch and fit perfectly. If you like Ugg Ultras but don't want to pay the price, these boots are worth a look."
2,did we get a defective pair?,"I ordered these boots for my husband based on the awesome sale price & all the positive reviews it had. The pair we received must be defective or something because all the fuzz seems to be falling out of them & the quality definitely doesn't seem ""great"" like the other reviewers wrote, in fact they look really oddly shaped, I'm thinking it's got to be a defect. I'm hoping I can send these back for a refund, they're terrible. I got a pair of Warmbats for myself & those are really beautifully crafted and SO comfortable - more $$ than these Staheekums but money well spent."
3,"GOOD PRODUCT, GOOD PRICE, INEPT SIZING",No problem (yet) with the boots but had to return for correct size. I wear 9 - 9.5 and the 10 I ordered was much too tight. Go up 1.5 sizes if you expect these to fit. Staheekum -- great American Indian sounding name for the usual Made in China product -- should do some product homework.
3,Sheepskin boots,"The boots are well made, and quite comfortable. My only complaint is that I looked everywhere to find a boot made in the USA; and after reading their glowing description of being made in the High Mountain valley next to a stream,and from a company called the Washington Shoe Co, I was very disapointed to find a made in China label inxide the boots. No where in their add did they mention this fact. So even though the boots are well made, I wouldn't have bought them if I had known."
4,awesome boots!,"the sizes are a little big, but who cares? i love them. they make my whole body warm. and the shipping was fast. so worth the money!"
2,Not in same class as UGG's,"Boots arrived quickly. I had ordered one size larger than my normal size, an 11 rather than my normal 10, due to having read previous customer reviews of the product. The 11's are still somewhat small in length for my foot, but they'll do as I don't want the hassle of sending them back. Also they aren't in the same class as UGG's, but then neither was the price, so I guess the old saying still goes... ""you get what you pay for..."""
3,"I agree with the others, order a size up","I got these recently as a Todays Deal special. I did not have time to read all the reviews and ordered true to size assuming they run a little big like Uggs. The recipient (gift) really liked them but unfortunately they were small. Yes he did try them on without socks for those who thinks that make a difference, since he intends to use them as slippers.The boots look nice and comfortable so I gave them 3 stars but I wish the manufacturer or Amazon advised people about how they run so they could order properly. Since the price has more than doubled since I ordered I will just send them back, but I would consider re-ordering in a bigger size if I catch them on sale again."
4,"great price,great service,",Good boot for the price.could use more arch support.Had to return first pair for size adjustment but was forewarned that they ran small.Service regarding exchange and account adjustments were prompt and accurate.
4,Great Boot,"My order was delivered in a timely manner and, boy, was the price right! My husband loves them. The only problem with the boot was that I expected the Chesnut color boot to somewhat resemble the color of the picture in the ad. It didn't. It had a different tone from the lightest color boot, but was equally as light a shade as the picture of the lighter color boot. So, if you buy this boot, expect the chestnut boot to be a fairly light color."
1,COMPANY DOES NOT STAND BEHIND ITS PRODUCTS,"My son received a pair from this company for Christmas...they began to fall apart in less than three weeks...I have no idea what store they came from ..as they were a gift....so the company will do nothing to replace them....This pair was totally junk...waste of money...I will never tell the person who was so wonderful to give this gift to my son...but really very very disappointed in their unwillingness to be responsible for what they make.Contacted the BBB and the company replaced them...they were unhappy about it, but at least when they were embarassed by the BBB involvement, they acutally became responsible and replaced them."
4,"nice boot, good value","These boots are similar to the Bearpaw 405 boots, with cow suede outer and inner sheepskin lining, but they are better quality than the Bearpaws--the lining is much softer. I found the size to be about 1/2 to a full size on the small side (I wear a ladies 11 wide, and usually a men's 9.5 is the perfect size for me. The men's size 10 was fine, although my toes initially touched the toe of the boot, fitting more like a size 9. After wearing them the fleece squashes down a bit and they fit fine.). They are a bit smaller than the Men's Emu stinger size 10 (which are, as expected, about a half size too large for me once the fleece squashed down)."
4,Size is an issue,"Well, I read the reviews, but the issue didn't make its self clear. So here it is:I wear a size 8 & 1/2. In the past I have bought similar footwear form other companies. Reading that the size was ""a little"" small I ordered a 9 instead of the 8 I usually order. I should have ordered the 10! It is not a little small, it is 1 & 1/2 sizes too small!Order accordingly.As for quality it is a very nice boot. Well stitched, good quality hide, nice sole.It is worth buying, just order too large so it will fit."
5,Just like UGGs only it's affordable!,This boot is really well made. It's so warm and comfortable. I wear a 9.5 and had to return the 10 for an 11 so I suggest getting a larger size than you think you might need. My toe is right at the end of an 11.
4,"Good value, compact, powerful, attractive binocular.","I can read license plates on cars at 1/4 mile, clearly. Good general purpose use. Great for hikng. Carry case is excellent. Even has diopter adjustment on occuler. One star off for shoe-lace neck cord."
2,binoculars,"good value for price, but hard to manually focus. You would be better off getting a self focusing model for a little more."
2,OK but not great,"I bought this product from a PetSmart store and although the concept is good, it still needs a little work. The ring itself won't seem to float evenly. One side dips under the water level so when I put the food in, it simply floats right out of the ring. I've tried playing with it to see if different things will even it out but when the fish come to eat, they move it a little and everything shifts around anyways.The underside of the product is hollow so air is trapped underneath the entire ring causing it to float. In the packaging it came with a styrofoam insert in this gap.. I'm assuming you're suppose to take it out because I personally wouldn't put styrofoam in my fish tank (although that would probably solve the uneven floating, that doesn't seem safe for the fish). There are no real directions besides two drawings and no warnings at all on the product.So it's an OK product but still could use some work - try it if you want but I'm thinking of returning mine."
2,"Close, but not close enough","This product is a great idea if it would just work as designed. If you take the time to position it properly, it'll float for a while. Then the fish nudge it at feeding time, and half of the ring will sink again. The styrofoam insert would make it float evenly, but as a previous poster said, I don't feel that's safe for the fish at all. Save your $2 for something else."
3,"Great idea, but too small.","I had high hopes for this product, as one of it's primary purposes is to keep fish food from spreading all over the tank, much of which ends up adding to the waste by-product, requiring constant tank-cleaning maintenance.I tried it out today, and it was a ""flop"" in that about 5% of the fish in the tank were able to nudge their way in the dense huddle that got to it first.This product DOES do what it says - the fish food added to the center of the ring stayed in the center. However, this product (I believe) only comes in one size, and really is best for very small tanks with no more than 5-10 fish, no bigger than an inch long (tops.)So, one must either buy many for a large tank (all my tanks have over 20 fish), or use this product for a 6 gallon or smaller tank (for instance, it works wonders in my new 6G Fluval tank, home to mostly growing baby fish.Great idea...just need to market different sizes, based on tank size and/or quantity of fish per tank."
1,"It wasn't even worth the $2 paid, sorry to say.","It wasn't even worth the $2 paid, sorry to say. It simply does not work as designed."
4,Great film for children,"We first saw Laura's Star at the National Gallery of Art during one of their family days last year. We really liked it and rented it from Netflix. My 3-year-old got it from Santa this year. This is a great movie for anyone, but especially children who have moved to a new home and need to see that new experiences can be magical and families stay together through changes."
5,Amazing !,"This is a wonderful animation ... excellent quality, way superior to the regular Disney and Pixar movies. The story line is free of violence and monsters.This DVD is a visual entertainment treasure for your child."
5,Star in our view,"My two year old loves this --the music is soothing-she loves the star(anyone who has a child who loves Dora's starcatcher). It is a bit slower and longer than what we Americans are used to, but is is a charming story with pretty illustrations and perfect music. So many themes are touched in this film-children moving, helping others, adventures in the world or sky. I will be searching out more in this series. I had chanced upon it at Walmart and was pleasantly surprized. I recommend it"
3,Beautiful animation,"My six year old is mesmerized by this movie. The plot itself is a little silly, but I have to admit the animation is quite beautiful. A great winding-down, pre-bedtime movie for active youngsters. The plot itself deals with a young girl who is finding difficulty coping with her family's recent move. She finds an injured, fallen star, which she befriends and nurses back to health. Eventually, the star makes its way back to the night sky and Laura realizes her new home isn't so bad, after all. Cute movie."
5,A Great Bargain,"A good set of BBQ tools for a great price. I presented them as a Father's Day gift and he is very pleased with them. They are very solid and almost too nice to use. The case they come with is very useful for keeping track of your BBQ stuff. My fiancee gave a set to her father, and he was just as impressed--I would highly recommend them. Just make sure to clean them up afterward, so they keep looking great!"
2,"Oh well, at least it only cost 20 bucks.","This looked like a pretty kewl piece of gadgetry when I looked at it on line. I was going to buy this for myself but ended up putting it on my wishlist and then receiving it as a gift.As it turns out, the case is not as swanky as it's online picture would have you think. It's not made of aluminum but has thin aluminum sheets with a prickly texture glued to it's sides(mine aren't glued very well either). The tools seem to be ok, but I don't expect that the case will hold up for very long. Maybe this is worth 20 bucks, but surely not more than that in my opinion.Maybe my standards are set too high?"
3,sad,well I'd hoped that it would be a good and inexpensive kit the case looks nice but the velcro straps came loose and i was missing a few items. that and the tongs handle comes loose easy
4,VERY GOOD INTRUDUCTION,"The documentary is much better than I expected! It was a blind buy but very rewarding.The film covers the whole life and work of Burgess, giving the basics about the author. Far away from deep, (but what can you give in less than one hour) though the film is well made and complete as possible.Great introduction for those, like me, who started as a Clockwork fan and found a much great writer hidden, the humour and language in Burgess works are the most amazing thing I ever read.PS: The cover is of the Borges not Burgess."
2,A Frenchified Documentary,"This writer created more than 40 books, but people know him mostly after Kubrick's filmic adaptation of ""Clockwork Orange.""Like Boy George, the author was a British citizen of Irish descent. Like former Congressman James Traficante (sp?), he had poorly coiffed hair.People who like hearing elite British people being interviewed will really like this. It felt like the type of work that one could see on PBS at night or on the weekends.Though the author wrote in English, most of the copies of his books on display were French. Instead of having Anglophone experts speak, they had Francophone ones do so with time-delayed translation. I don't recall the work saying Burgess was a Francophile, so I'm not sure why this documentary is so French."
3,"Good Songs, Poor Renditions","This karaoke compilation of five of Jessica's best songs was surprisingly disappointing. While it does include the breathtaking ballads ""I Wanna Love You Forever,"" ""Where You Are,"" and ""Heart of Innocence,"" as well as the dance track ""I Think I'm In Love With You,"" it offers very poor versions. The backup singers sound synthetic and almost laughable, and the singer on the lead tracks is no Jessica Simpson. Why ""The Woman In Me"" made the cut is beyond me. It's difficult to sing alone, and to the novice singer, very easily throws you off key.Despite everything, it is fun to see how (or if) you can carry the difficult vocals, and Jessica is one singer with a great deal of talent, as well as a wonderful role model. A must for any true fan."
1,Keys don't work; Support doesn't exist.,"I've had my keyboard for about four months. At first, it was a pleasure to use and I had no complaints. But it soon developed a problem. The ""a"", ""q"" and ""2"" keys started working intermittently. They soon stopped working at all, and now the problem is spreading to the surrounding keys. I've called Palm support a couple of times trying to get it fixed, and the responses ranged from, you need to update the driver, to the keyboard is dirty to, yeah, other people have had problems with it, too. I asked if I could send it in for repair, and they said, sure, IF I sent it in the ORIGINAL PACKAGING with the ORIGINAL RECEIPT. The reciept I have; the original packaging I don't. Sorry, they said, then we can't fix it for you."
4,Leave the laptop at home,"I use this keyboard for times when I have a lot of text entry to do. When graffiti is too slow, the keyboard meets all of my needs for school and writing. The keyboard housing is metal and is very sturdy when folded up and snapped shut. When open, though, you have to be a bit more careful because the keys are plastic. I have had the unit for about a half a year and it still works great, even though it has been floating around in my backpack. IF YOU ORDER ONE, BE SURE TO UPGRADE THE KEYBOARD DRIVER, WHICH CAN BE FOUND ON THE PALM SITE.I wish the neoprene case had room for the keyboard AND the Palm. I also wish that the short cut commands were printed in the manual instead of in the help file on the Palm. With more Palm software programs supporting keyboard commands, you can leave the laptop at home."
3,"Very cool, but flimsy","Don't get me wrong, this portable keyboard for my Palm V, combined with the modem, mean that I don't have to lug my laptop on every business trip. It has also totally changed the way I use my Palm. My biggest complaint is that I've only had it a few months, and already some of the keys are starting to lose their functionality. I need to hit Z key repeatedly to get it to work..."
4,Truly italian,"The recording of this CD belongs to 80's and Rampal is still the greatest. About the performances here included I have to say that are really italian!! A very good CD, I reccomend you all."
3,LEGACY,"This video is 1 hour long.Various interviews by: his widow , friends and by students of Segovia including Eliot Fisk(who also plays Bach's ""Prelude""),10 minutes of rare master class footage,Segovia bio info from Hugh Downs and excerpts from ""The Guitar And I"" narrated by Segovia as the camera pans through the villages of Spain.Segovia plays a few pieces,mostly excerpts,but one with an orchestra.This video is something for the person that is desperate for anything having to do with Segovia.There should be more guitar playing footage to satisfy the viewer. But, all in all its worth the money."
5,Five stars for maestro Segovia,"This 60 minute retrospective on the maestro Andres Segovia is a delightful overview of his monumental career, including footage of the masterclasses at Santiago de Compostella (1965), snippets from the Christopher Nupin profiles, the maestro's appearance in the BBC special on the Prada, as well as testimonials by producer Israel Horwitz, guitarists Oscar Ghiglia and Eliot Fisk, and 20/20 correspondant Hugh Downs. Oh when will Kultur item 1290 on the Legacy of Segovia be available on DVD?!?!"
4,The Real Real West,"This book opened my eyes to what life on the western frontier was really like. Forget current media fictionalizations, the frontier was not a shooting gallery. No handsome stranger rides into to town to save the cowering inhabitants from evil. The crooks and crooked politics are all there, just like they are today. The sheriff was not always the stalwart defender of the law, in fact he sometimes had business interests to protect.McGrath offers a carefully documented narrative of the day to day goings on during the gold rush. The data is from public records and the fill-in is from newspaper archives. A detailed yet readable account of frontier life. Far better than any cowboy novel, this is the real west.Steve Hurst"
5,"Good book, great price","This book is brand new - for three bucks! Roger McGrath is a well-known western historian, and although I hadn't heard of most of the incidents in this book, they are still very intesting to read about. I would recommend this seller to anyone."
1,There are so many better books on type out there. . . .,"This book is the worst: poorly designed, poor selection of work, poor reproductions. And it's not even about ""big type"". The intro says: ""<em>Big Type</em> is not what it might seem. This book is a collection of design work in which the typographic elements assume primary importance."" So the editors knew the title was misleading? Then why not change the title? Yuck."
5,Wear it out!,"This was my first Aretha Franklin Cd (lp at the time), and I wore it out. I became an instant and avid fan. This is still my favourite Aretha cd. Maybe because you never forget the first time. Besides the classics Day Dreaming, Rock Steady and Oh me, oh my, her covers of Didn't I blow your mind and I've been loving you too long, burn with a soulful intensity. She makes these songs her own, and that is no mean feat when the original singer is Otis Redding. Young, gifted and black is sung with a gospel fervor that teaches you what soul is all about. It is hard to find a weak cut on this cd. Aretha's voice is at it's peak in both strength and musicality. Highly recommended."
3,"Great for Vocab Learning, Not Much More","This system is great for learning vocabulary--and not much more than that. The title ""instant immersion"" is a bit misleading--you'll only be immersed in lots of new words. I think Learn French Now! or Smart Start French (both for sale at Amazon.com) are better software packages for learning the language all-around, but this software is cheap and a good place to start if nothing else."
2,Not Great,"Not a total waste of money, but not a lot of value either. Some decent basic vocabulary, and the say it/play it helped me improve my pronunciation. But no help at all in figuring out how to actually speak sentences in French. The sentence/phrase examples are strictly memorization.. not useful. And I could never understand enough to use the 2nd CD at all. I didn't find the Dictionary or French Tour CDs useful either. The Michel Thomas CD course has been much more productive."
1,Misleading packaging,"I would give this program three stars if the intent was JUST to have a reference. If you had a handle on French and just needed something to go to to reinforce your language skills. As for beginners, this program is a waste of money."
1,What the hell is this ???,"The worst thing I've ever bought in my life. How much French could you learn from it ? I've just learnt French for about 8 weeks in a course in uni, about 1/4 of a beginner French textbook and I found that the the 2 CDs ""Talk Now"" and ""World Talk"" have almost nothing new to learn from. And what about the ""talking dictionary"" ? The only thing it can talk is ENGLISH, not French ? Why do I need a dictionary which talks English when I'm learning French. And there is no mention about it on the cover. Can I call it cheating ??? The ""Voyage in France"" is interesting but it is in English and I can't learn any French from it. If you're planning to travel to France, it is helpful but not if you want to learn French. Conclusion : just a waste of money."
1,What?,"I bought this about 3 months ago and am now writing a review. I feel that when you purchase language learning software, it should be concise, easy, and basically in order. Is anyone feeling me on this? I got bored through 2 lessons and unfortunately couldn't return the item because, yes ladies and gentlemen I had already opened it. Boo Hoo! So please, any first time buyers; don't make the same mistake I did. Read the reviews and use common sense."
4,Explains the SPC philosophy extremely well!,This book starts with a extremely well explained chapter on the philosophy of control charts. This is really the most important part of the book. Other topics about rational subgrouping and myths are also very well covered. The book deals with interesting examples which should be a little bit more up-to-date. Presenting control charts on mm-paper is outdated in this computer era.
4,Reference Guide for SPC related Engineers,"This is an excellent cookbook for participants in SPC. It helps you to avoid of miss-using the SPC.For me, it helps me to prepare training material on SPC easier.Unfortunately, the theory aspect in this book is not enough for expert usage."
2,Ok book for beginners,"I purchased this book believing that it would give me insight to SPC and more specifically control charts, and as a supplement to text books I currently own by Montgomery. I can say that this book is OK for beginners who have not had any exposure at all to college level SPC or Control Chart classes or books. However, if you already own any college level text book regarding SPC, Quality Control, or Control Charts, this book will be too elementary for you."
4,Very Useful from the Master(s),"Extremely helpful in understanding and utilizing SPC concepts from the three minds that have really lead the SPC effort in the USA (Deming, Chambers and Wheeler)."
4,"Excellent techniques, accessible writing","This text seems to have been designed primarily for accessibility, and it has certainly achieved that. It pretty much explains in simple terms (anything above high school math) everything you need to create and use SPC and other control charts. This was more basic than what I was shooting for, but it's easy to skim through parts. I imagine the target audience was lower-middle management or factory line workers.More in-depth information and proofs are supplied for some aspects, though it is stressed that these methods have been found useful empirically and that was their primary aim, and although a good bit of theory informed their design, they aren't necessarily theoretically rigorous. In other words, they are pragmatic rather than academic.The techniques are certainly useful. I'm starting to apply them for software."
4,Excellent Detailed teachings on Process Control,"More than a cookbook, this text provides an excellent reference on SPC. It clears away many myths and gives useful specific case studies. The book also reviews many mistakes commonly made with control charts and SPC techniques"
5,Excellent one day simulations,"These one day simulations from the 1970's are a wonderful teaching tool. My US History teacher used them in 1975 and I used them in my classes in the 80's and 90's. Now that I am an administrator, I am wanting to give them to my Social Studies staff. These simulations put your students ""in the time period"" being studied and require them to make decisions.You will not regret this purchase as your students will validate how much they are enjoying them and thereby make the teacher's life that much more rewarding. I am sure these simulations were created by ""real"" teachers."
5,PROGRESS OF ANOTHER PILGRIM,I PURCHASED THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY BIBLE STUDY GROUP AS I HAD FOUND IT VERY INSPIRATIONAL WHEN I PURCHASED MY FIRST COPY SOME 20 YEARS AGO. I STILL THINK IT IS A GREAT DEVOTIONAL.
4,Great portable chair,I'm a big guy and the Coleman Deck Chair is very sturdy and comfortable. I would reccommend this item to anyone looking for a sturdy folding portable chair.
5,versatile wide-angle,I got it because I intend to use it on both my film and my digital bodies. For ultra wide angles I'll use it with film (Nikon N-80) and for more conventional wide angle with my Nikon D-200. It's one of three lenses I'm taking with me on vacation to the mountain states. The others are a Nikkor 28mm - 85mm and a Nikkor 70mm - 300mm with 2X Tamron SP doubler. Since I don't yet have photoshop or similar I wanted to be able to take real wide shots without having to paste them together.
5,Exorcism 101,"For those interested in the topic, this is a must for your library. It covers all the bases in a quesion/answer format. I did learn more and I have a pretty extensive collection of books on the subject."
4,Excellent hand pump.,"As a basketball and soccer coach for my two boys, I pump up a LOT of balls. I've had this pump for several months now and it has worked flawlessly. The dual action really does cut pumping time in half. It's pretty amazing how fast you can pump up a flat ball with this small pump. I also like the storage compartment that holds extra needles. I would give it 5 stars if it had a built-in pressure gauge. My last pump had that feature and I miss it. However, my last pump fell apart on me, so I can live without the gauge in return for a sturdier pump. Highly recommended, and a bargain at this price.UPDATE 12/17/12:Well, the pump worked great for all this time and it finally got lost! I'm shocked that I lost it before it ever broke. I'm buying another one right now."
4,works,"works well for soccer and basketball, easily packed so I dont have to lug around a large pump, made well"
2,It Is the..Was the best pump ive had.,So i like soccer and i have about 15 balls and get new ones occasionly. The pump was doing good for the 1st 2 weeks and then the thing you pump broke off.. i tried fixing it but nothing made it work like before so i just tossed it in the garbage..:(
4,Absorbing,"A totally absorbing ""atmosphere"" book. I literally couldn't put it down --- Its got everything a history, mystery and horror fan could want...Ghosts of Templar Knights, a forbidden bog, a town with a terrible secret, and a curious new clergyman trying to piece it all together in 14th century England. A great ""escape"" or vacation read."
2,Baby's head pushed forward to chest,"Perhaps I just ordered the wrong size, but I could never get a comfortable fit with my baby in the sling. The sling always seemed to push the baby's head forward to baby's chest, so I was always worried the baby couldn't breathe. I even consulted with a baby store employee and practiced, but I couldn't get a good fit. Perhaps I was just paranoid. It's a shame too because I really like the idea of a sling -- it's so much lighter and easier to pack than other carriers. However, it isn't super comfortable when baby gets heavier. I just started using it again as a hip-carry, so hopefully I'll have more success with that.I'm sorry to say that I can't recommend the product. I also have a moby-style wrap (best for newborns) and an ergo carrier. I LOVE my ergo!!!"
2,Not for me!,"Maybe this works for some women, but I am long torsoed and plus size and it was awful. I ended up giving it away. It felt constricting and really hot."
3,Reversible?,"I liked the color/pattern.I purchased a size 1. I am 5', 100lbs. It was a few inches too long. The bottom reached the top of my hips.Nevertheless, I tried and managed to get baby in it looking comfy on the 3rd try (cradle position.. I even nursed her, but had to lift her body since it sat too low), but somehow not on the 4th and 5th tries. I think that had to do with it being too long.As far as reversible, there are tags on the brown side which will hang loose. If you don't mind that, sure, it's reversible."
4,Still ticking.,"Mine is older than dirt, now serving as a backup. It has proven itself to be reliable, sturdy (except for the flip-open cover) and easy to use. Of course, the software available is incredibly diverse, making this a very useful tool in business, travel and entertainment (egs. financial spreadsheets, airline schedules, 100s of games). I get months out of 2 AAA batteries, even with frequent use of the easy to read backlighting for the screen. I would say that you cannot go wrong with the PalmIII, though the price makes other brands/models worth considering too."
1,terrible hotsync,"I purchased two of these from gadgix. They each came with a keyboard, software, craddles, screen portectors, and a warenty... I am running windows XP and have yet to get the system to regonize the craddle... i went the distance to purchase an usb to serial converter. the system picked up on the cord but not the craddle."
3,Just Okay,"Product was deliverd on time. I guess I didn't know enough about Palm products before choosing this. I went from a color PDA to this which is black on amber? Contract isn't high enough to satisfy me, but it's enough to get by until it dies or I become independently wealthy. One issue is that the 'Sync' cord requires a male 9 pin plug - all laptops now only have female 24 pin outlets - so I'm in search of an adaptor. I'll take the fall for this purchase - I was not knowledgable enough to know exactly what I was getting."
4,Nice product at first,"This was my first Palm purchase and I originally bought it to replace my Day Runner. I chose it because the price was reasonable and for the expanded memory. I was really pleased at how easy it was to set up and all of the documentation it came with. With all of the applications that are available, I use it for virtually everything. However, after having it for a year, I am now looking for a newer model to replace it with. I am having problems with the machine spontaneously resetting and for the last 2 months I have had to redigitize every 1-2 days. You also will definitely spend your money in batteries, I replace mine about about every 3 weeks. In spite of the problems, it was certainly worth the money especially since I got a sweet deal on the price. If you are looking for Palm to start with this is a perfect choice."
1,bad product,"I am currently on my third palm IIIxe, it seems to just stop working. Won't turn on, and after 2 of these, I just bought a pocket pc. I will never buy another palm product again All they offer me now is a trade up, which is essentially 15% off a new one. Big deal."
5,The Palm IIIxe,"Well when you first look at it you think WHAT? 249.00? FOR AN ORGANIZER? NOT ME BUDDY! But when i got mine i was amazed at all the things i could do with it, i mean games,datbases,avantgo maps of my hometown,and towns of other FREE software, if you are looking for an inexspensive Palm this is the one to get."
1,Might be nice if it worked,"I ordered this from a reseller, cg_enterprises@tds.net. The unit arrived without a cradle to charge it. I emailed the reseller and was told it would be sent overnight. Four days later it has not arrived. When I contacted the reseller again, I received the following professional response: ""Bite Me!"".So if you buy one of these used be careful!"
2,major display problems,"The Palm IIIxe is an ok organizer. It has to do list, memo, calender, calculator... But this unit has display problems. I had mine for a week, and my battery was about 30%. Then my display wouldnt work. I left the palm alone for a couple of days. When i turned it on, the screen was blinking. I recomend getting the Visor Deluxe because it is more durable and it also has the expansion slot in the back."
2,"The ""almost there"" Palm","I bought my palm in December, and initially the palm could perform up to my initial expectations, but when I wanted the Palm to do more,it wouldn't. In particular I have had problems finding software that would allow me to view Microsoft spreadsheets or Microsoft Word documents. I still haven't found a good way to view either. It seems that Pocket PC may be the better OS for office productivity."
2,I can't synch....,"I bought a IIIex,with a lot of expectation, and i havent been able to SYNCH both of my computers with my palm, because it has a serial port and neither of the one recognise it. I really dont know what to do in the case."
1,Palm support sucks,Just got my IIIXE today from Amazon. Palm has to calibrate screen the first time you use it; and it ask me to use the stylus to tap on the target at screen to calibrated it; but nothing happens when I tap on it. I called palm tech support and I have told that I have a defective unit. And because they are so kind they are going to send me a conditional unit(used). So I said thank you very much and returned the unit instead.
2,Unfortunate circumstance,"Had to replace the batteries twice in less than four weeks. Contacted Palm by e-mail twice regarding the problem and they weren't helpful at all. Had to call customer service on my dime. Two choices were offered: Return the product and receive a re-conditioned model with a 90-day warranty. Or, return my model to be repaired, in which case I'll be without it for 2-3 weeks. Needless to say I won't be buying anything from Palm in the future."
5,If I had to do it again...,"Someone gave the the Vx as a gift so I can't really say I had a choice in the matter, but if I were buying right now I think I choose the IIIx. If you are at all interested in going beyond the basic calender, address books, note pad functions, then get the models with the extra memory. Vindigo (free Zagat restaurant and updated movie listings) and AvantGo (free newspapers and magazines in electronic formats) will use the space and take your palm experience to a whole new level. If you live in a major city, Vindigo alone makes it worth owning a Palm.So why IIIx over Palm Vx?1. No difference in funcitonality (at all)2. Significantly cheaper (w/rebate)3. More case options for III4. More attachments for III5. Coolness factor dwindles quickly6. We'll probably all be replacing these on 12 mos for ones that have big MP3 players attached, why spend more now?"
4,"wonderful, yet fragile","I own a palm IIIe. I use it mainly for phone numbers and lists. 2 megs of memory are plenty. The only drawback is the screen is made of glass. I have already broken two during daily work activities. Both times the IIIe was in my back pocket and got smashed by bumping into a post the first time, and sitting on it the second. The cheap plastic cover just flexes right into the screen. Do not buy this machine if your job entails any degree of physical activity."
5,Palm is an amazing organizational tool!,"The Palm IIIxe is a very useful item for me. I have quite an extensive listing of phone numbers which have proven to be very handy for me. When I'm away from home, my ""phone book"" is always with me. I love using the Memo Pad to take notes at meetings, jot down ideas to present at meetings, sermon notes, grocery lists, etc. I also love the date book as well. Again, I don't have to worry about leaving my calendar wherever I'm not. The Palm is amazing. I'm considering purchasing the keyboard just to make it easier to enter lots of text."
5,"In one word, ""Intuitive""","I am a senior finance major at a top university. My friend got an I-Paq and I looked over it thoroughly before buying my Palm. It just took too much time to navigate. PocketPC is an improvement over WinCE, but still wastes time. I have waited over a year to get mine, and it set my life free. I use spreadsheets, from a 3rd party app called ""QuickOffice"" that are perfectly integrated with Excel. No more bustling around a laptop. A quick note, if you need anything more than just an address book and planner, get something (such as this IIIxe or a Vx) with 8 MB of storage. This is simply amazing."
4,A Compact storehouse of information !,I have had a good experience using this product but at the end of one month i have had to do a hard reset of this unit twice. having loaded this unit with my valuable personal information i dread to think about the consequences of not having access to my PC which has the Palm Desktop manager with the data. certainly it has all the features to keep one organised but the utitlity is diminished with a unstable operating system.I hope it is not another Windows. Will Palm address this issue ?
2,Poor Quality Plastic Toy!,"The only good thing about this Palm is that it comes with 8MB RAM and upgradable PalmOS 3.5 .Having used Palm Vx and Visor Deluxe before, Palm IIIxe can immediately be distinguished by its poor built quality and handling. The chasis is made of cheap plastic that makes you suspect it's fake. Another feature, contrary to the above models, is that the the digitizer(or plastic shielding) goes down about a milimeter down when you tap the stylus in the middle of the screen.Palm IIIxe is overpriced and not suiatable for frequent use at all; Visor Deluxe provides much better value at the same price.If you are a serious user then Palm Vx is a MUST!"
5,Perfect for the organized person...but...,"I've been using a Palm IIIx for a year now, and yes, it's a brilliant device- but it's not for everyone. Should you buy one? Yes, if:1. You're already an organized person. If you're the type who uses a datebook or calendar, who answers their e-mail immediately and who keeps up to date to-do lists, you'll find the Palm a godsend. You'll find yourself whipping out the Palm during meetings to answer your e-mail, making notes for grocery shopping and jotting down telephone numbers and addresses.2. You're a gamer or technofreak. You'lllove the variety of software for the Palm. You'll be playing SimCity (yes, there's a Palm version!), chess, Galaxian and programming in FORTH, C and various Palm-specific interpreters.3. You're a hardware hacker. The Palm is a great interface for all sorts of experimentation.But if you buy the Palm thinking it'll make you organized...nope, won't happen. Save your money."
4,Replaces my need for a laptop,"I've had mine since July 2000, and I love it! Mine did not have the faulty memory issue, and I would have been quite upset if I had to install a software patch on a brand new unit (so beware before you buy). The screen tends to scratch too easily, and I wasn't impressed when I called Palm or checked their website concerning the screen extended warranty. Consider using WriteRights. I also have been happy with the Palm Leather zippered case I purchased, especially since I read of problems with cases damaging screens that don't have the flip guard installed, and I didn't want to attach velcro to my Palm either. ""PalmPilot: The Ultimate Guide, 2nd Edition"" by O'Reilly is a good reference book to help you get started."
3,"Great, but be carefull","I used to write some notes in a small notepad in paper, after having the palm III, I start depending on it, all notes I needed to take were there, once it fell and the screen broke , I knew then that palm don't have representative in Portugal, so I went to there site (very good support) and had a chat with the suport, where they explained to me the possible sulotions, buy another one, or send it to Madrid, (the warranty had expired). I think that the repair should be almost the price of a new one.So the final rate is buy one, but be carefull. lnovais@mail.com"
4,Palm IIIxe vs. Handspring,"It wasn't until after I had purchased my Palm that I realized there was something called a Handspring. Eager to know if I had made the right decision, I began researching the features of the two. They both have several unique things about them, but what the basic choice becomes is upgradeable (Palm) or expandable(Handspring). I don't even make a dent in the memory in my Palm, so the option of expanding the available memory didn't appeal to me. Another idea to consider, I don't think the Handsping has beaming capabilitites. The only disappointment with my Palm has been a quality issue (I've had to return it twice), which I have assured by salespeople as being highly abnormal."
4,Great for the average Joe or Jane!,I found it very adequate. I'm a college student and it fulfilled all my needs and is very dependable!
4,Good value,"This is the second one I have bought. The first for me, the second for my wife, a devoted paper Franklin Planner user. Within two weeks, the paper was gone and she was using the Palm and Franklin software. Durable, easy to use and alot of software availability. My wife is happy with this one. I'm looking to upgrade to the Vx when the price drops a bit."
3,Reply to person from MD,"If you're thinking about a IIIxe or a visor deluxe, I would choose a IIIxe, because the Visor Deluxe crashes too much! Also, how much memory do you need do you think?"
1,"Defective Operating Chips, No Known Cure","Just bought and twice in last week have lost all data due to ""8DRAM"" problem which Palm blames on subcontractor. Web site promises non-existent diagnostic test. Tech support cannot give date for fix. They offer to replace units with others which may be defective. Buy Handspring until Palm gets its production problems and warranty systems in place."
4,Great product but could be more durable,"I am very happy with my Palm IIIxe's performance as a computing platform. No complaints there. However, I have to take some issue with the durability of the unit. I have had a good bit of trouble with the screen. I've had a total of 3 different unit over a year or so, and each time the unit failed becuse of a screen problem."
3,Palm breaks very easily,"I had a Palm III and it cracked after dropping on the ground, I tried to call Palm to fix it, however, the technical support folks won't try to fix it without a $100 down payment, he suggested me to buy a new one, which I don't think I will do it again. I suggested getting a real thick plastic protector for the unit."
4,Throw out the paper organizers,"Had the Palm IIIxe for two weeks now and I no longer use my day planner. As an Executive Director of an Eye Bank I am always looking for a phone number, or my sched. This Palm IIIxe works like a charm. The screen is not as bright or sharp as many reviews claim in dim lighting, but generally its darn good. The Palm Vx is the same device as the IIIxe only a liitle smaller with a metal case and costs about $150.00 more. Save your money and get the IIIxe instead. Got my Palm here on Amazon! Delivered in three days! Nice job Amazon."
5,get it,"this product is unregretful must(?) buy product... if you compare it with Palm Vx(one of the popular palms), you'll find the functions are all same except for the fact that Palm Vx only has advantage over advanced LCD and rechargeble batteries. who cares if LCD is advanced? gray is still gray. rechargeble batteries are better, but rechargeble ones lasts UPTO 2 weeks but AA batteries on palmIIIxe lasts up to a whole month. those two advantages and a better look ... plus get it quickly because palm stopped making this product and its one of the top sellers!"
1,"Great Classic Machine, but there's MUCH better out now!","I've been using Palms since they came out, including the IIIxe. Today Amazon offered this machine to me through their ""Gold Box offers"" at ($$$) less than their current price of ($$$). Unless you have a major investment in accessories that only work with the Palm III series, there is NO reason to spend any more than HALF this amount on this machine. There are too many other new machines which have extra desired features (removable storage, better audio, faster chip, etc.) that sell for less. These include machines by Palm, HandEra, Sony, etc. etc. The Palm IIIxe is a great machine, for 1998! :)"
2,Palm IIIxe,"This unit does not come with a powered cradle, so when the batteries die...so does your data!! Beware. We upgraded to a Palm 125....same problem...no power cradle to recharge batteries...AND the outdated operating system will not let you store programs on the 16MB memory card. Are you listening PALM??? The Compaq units are more expensive, but less arcane. Consider them."
1,THIS IS REFURBISHED!!!!,"This is my first review and I'm a little hot about it. I just received my Palm from Tiger Direct and it is refurbished. Not only that, but not all the items that are supposed to come with it are in the box. I have no idea how it works, but know that you are not buying a NEW product. Plus, I am reading the return directions from Tiger Direct and they are awful. I am waiting to hear from Amazon and will amend this if they take care of the problems. UNLESS YOU WANT A REFURBISHED ITEM, DO NOT BUY THIS."
2,palm pilots,"I would NOT recomend Palm pilots. My friend has to fix them almost every day. If you want a good handheld, check sony."
4,I need answers,"I would love to give you a review but I still have a lot of questions and need to talk to someone who can answer them. I want to buy a PalmIIxe but I am not sure if it will do what I want it to do. I want to download text ( from e-magazines, e-books, articles, book reviews etc.) from the internet and read them in my free time, on the job or out fishing. This Palm IIIxe (I'm a newbie)looks good but I can't be sure. If yes, what accesseries would I have to buy to do this? Does the stand come with this to make reading easier? Is there something else that would be superior for my purposes? In a quandry. Thanks guys, Stan Stan"
2,BBBBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDDDD,"BAD PRODUCT. THIS PRODUCT IS JUST PLAIN NOT GOOD. TRUST ME, IF YOU WANT A PDA GET AN COMPAQ IPAQ. THEY ARE MUCH BETTER. THEY WORK AS A PDA, AND A POCKET PC."
4,Punk and orderly,"The Kicks is from Little Rock, Arkansas. They are inspired by the punk sound of TSOL and the pop sensibility of The Cars. They have been together since 2000. ""Radar"" is like classic hardcore punk. It has anger and energy. ""What Do I Have To Do?"" is more melodic and more like English pop. ""Satellite"" is a cool song that is more like being in Los Angeles. They have a range of sounds. They are a talented bunch."
2,Just not my style...,"Don't get me wrong, this album is not entirely unlistenable... As far as pop punk goes, it's one of the better that I've heard, it's just not MY style. But, it may be yours.. so here's what it's like: If you enjoy pop punk bands like Good Charlotte, Yellowcard, & Dashboard Confessional, with prettyguys and high voices, then you'll probably love this album.If you prefer groups like the Distillers, Rancid, or the Dirtbombs then steer clear of the Kicks."
3,"Works Well, but my wrist hurt","I got this product for my MacBook. It does what it is advertised to do, however I found that I had to hit the keys so much harder to type that my wrist started hurting. I ended up removing it from my computer."
4,Great,"This has been great. I just got it for my new 2.2Ghz Macbook. My old iBook, after nearly three years, was feeling its age. Half the keys were rubbed blank and it just looked *dirty*. So, I decided to get a keyboard protector, as well as a ""skin"" for the whole machine. So for full MB protection, I recommend this keyboard skin (be careful to either get the clear one or wait until they update the colored ones for the new Apple keyboard layout), and Best Skins Ever to cover the whole surface (including wrist rest area, trackpad and button)."
3,expected a little more,ok..gets a little annoying to keep on keyboard bc of typing and it doesn't stay on sometimes.
1,flmisy and cheap!,"i guess you get what you pay for. and seller did not send when they said they would. then when they did resend it. I wanted to send it back. kind of an ""IRREGULAR"" FIT! just go to MAC and buy the real thing!"
3,"Adequate, but not made by ProTouch.","The product fits over the keyboard ok, but it's not the brand-name as advertised. I expected a ProTouch. Not having seen one in real life, I assume this IPOPO product is similar. It seems good enough for me and not worth the hassle of returning it.The silicon is very thin and easy to type with, easy to see through. It actually lays over the edge of the keyboard, I expected it to wedge into the top and bottom edges, but it doesn't.On the other hand I submitted a question to the seller and they got back to me in a timely manner, answered my question and treated it with genuine concern. Good effort, but I'm still wondering if I got what was promised."
5,Great keyboard Protector,"The protector fits perfectly for my 13"" MacBook. Now i have peace of mind eating besides my laptop without worrying drop cracks on keyboard"
4,worth buying,"i bought this product for my second macbook after having spilled lemonade on my first and ruining it. I also got a similar item that goes in the ports to protect them from spills, since that's where the majority of the lemonade went. I really like this protector, it doesn't get in the way of typing and honestly makes it more comfortable to type (my nails no longer scrape against the keys, which used to remind me of a chalk board). it also makes typing quieter."
4,Good Product,"I just recieved this product today, and so far I am very pleased with it. It definately protects they keys very well and is very nice to the touch. I am giving it 4 stars because it does not necessarily make typing hard, but it takes a little getting used to, especially if you might normally hit the side of a key when typing. The cover makes it hard to press the the keys on the corner sometimes, so it makes you hit the key more directly on top. Other than that, this is a great product. I am very pleased with it."
2,"does what it's supposed to, but slows down typing.","The Keyboard Protector fits very well on my MacBook, but in the end I got tired of how much slower my typing was when I used the protector. It claims it doesn't slow down your typing speed at all, but it really does; you have to push on the keys harder when you type and for me it took a concsious effert to do so. As I'm typing this review now, I'm not using my protector anymore. If you don't mind how it slows down your typing, then go ahead and get it."
3,It's alright..not what I had expected or wanted.,"I like this product that it is thin and that it can keep the dust away. However, whenever I type the cover tends to come up slightly. It does not lie flat. The other thing is there is no stamp of iSkin and Protouch on the this cover as it states. Which makes me wonder if it is the iSkin brand. I had originally bought my cover at Apple and the cover has the stamped words and as well as it goes over the indented keyboard of the MacBook which this product does not. I'm concerned that if or when a drink spills the liquid will seep through because it does not really cover the whole keyboard. It's a slight disappointment but this will do for now until I can get the real cover."
1,Difficult to assemble,Very difficult to assemble and keep assembled. Only purchase it if you intend to leave it in the original box as a collectible. Not worth the money as a play toy due to the poor quality
1,Didn't make it to Spring,Very disappointed in Trico. Didn't last through a very mild winter. Also website shows different size blades for my car than the manufacturer recommends.
1,winter wiper blades,My car stays in the garage when not in use. The cover on one of the blades tore loose and began to flap in the breeze within a couple of months of purchasing these blades. Would not buy again.
3,Millenium Worship Two,"I liked the Cd's, however I like the Millenium Worship CD's better which came out first."
5,Must-Have CD that defines the X-Files,"When this originally came out, there was also a CD of songs ""inspired-by"" the show...in so many ways does this surpass that CD (and in my opinion the new X-Files: The Album) because this album, as a whole, has a significant rhythm, and life of its own."
5,"This CD offers an extreme experience, one in its kind.",This album is not only another set of soundtracks. It is a product that provides the customer with a very special experience. Now you can not only see the X-Files but also hear and truly feel its unique nature. It is a MUST for all X-Files fans.
5,Mark Snow rocks my socks,"It brought me back to Sunday nights. Mark Snow's music is absolutely beautiful, haunting and breathtaking. If you love the X-Files you will love this cd."
5,I like this C.D. so much that I know most of it by heart,"I recommend this C.D. to everyone, even if you are not an X-Files fan. I've listened to it many times. It only is music with sometimes people frme the show talking. I rate it five stars."
3,good,"First thing, there are too much talking in the cd. But there are 6 thacks of pure score, that's what we are looking for, and there are great. Thack 2 is the best, the x-files theme of course !"
3,Not your fathers Hunter original,"Hunter keeps cutting cost out of what they call ""Hunter Original"". I have one I bought back in 1995 that was a true 'oil bath'. Its decent fan and hasn't died yet though its placed in garage and only used occasionally. Attractive design."
