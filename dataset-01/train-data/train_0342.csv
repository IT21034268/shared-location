5,Super Fast!,This was shipped to me the day after I ordered it and the the tracking details were sent immediately. This arrived in perfect condition and came days before I expected it!
2,Not totally satisfied with this version,"Oops! Did I make a big mistake! I purchased both versions of the Scarface movie,(Full screen and Wide screen) and did not like the Full screen version at all.Images were missing and the picture was not sharp. It was kind of fuzzy. TheWide screen was perfect. There was more images and detail and the picture wasclear and sharp! A greater viewing accuracy."
4,Great deal,"Product is excellent, certainly a great addition to any collection. Only damages were a few cracks on the coners of the box, I guess this is normal for a product of this age."
5,excellent movie,Thank you so much for sending the DVD as quickly as you did.We tried to buy the DVD locally and no one carried it. We didn't expect it to arrive so quickly.We'll use your service again.ThanksSally
5,An awesome peice to any collection!!!,"When I first watched Scarface, I was blown away with why I never watched it before hand. I bought the movie from Target at first and treasured it within my collection. But I was always on the lookout for something more to celebrate this classic movie. I didn't buy this boxset off of Amazon. I found it at Sam's Club for $20, and I just had to have it! When I first opened it, I was so excited. There lied the 2-disc edition of the 1983 remake of the 1930's Scarface(Which is also included). What really made me fall in love with this boxset, is the fact that it comes with poster art that was released when the movie was first released. The money clip that came with it was pretty awesome too. If you are thinking of buying it, DO IT!!! You will not regret it, I promise!!"
5,Perfection!,"This movie is a must have!! Any one who love gangster and/or action movies, this will be the one for you!"
3,Brutal,"I didn't like this movie the first time I saw it, after a while though, I've grown to love it. Though the plot is kind of sketchy, there is enough action and violence to keep fans of gangster movies satisfied. I also loved Tony Montana's accent."
1,Overrated movie by an overrated director,"Scarface is overlong, excessively vulgar and violent. I agree that this movie has been influential, but for all the wrong reasons. Many gangster rap groups, most notably the Geto Boys, used many soundbites from Scarface throughout their career to accentuate their bravado or ""hardcore attitude toward life."" It's a shame that De Palma convinced so many talented people to waste their time with this gutter trash. Howard Hawks' Scarface is still superior in every way."
1,Good acting... but very disappointing!,First I must say that I am a *BIG* fan of mafia/ganster books and movies. Often you will find that bad reviews are given by people who are not fans of the genre (ie. they were never really interested in seeing the film in the first place) -- this is not the case with me. After reading all of the reviews on this site I thought that I had found a real winner. What I found was a movie that dragged on far too long and had a ridiculous plot. The movie is so bad that it isn't worth elaborating. I seem to be far out-numbered in my view on this movie but I stand by it!
2,Who wants realism?,"Al Pacino plays the drug dealer brilliantly. The constant use of the 'F' word, the disgusting personal habits, the constant betrayals by the underworld members of each other make this movie as close to realistsic as one would want. In reality criminals are scum and Scorcese is one of the few directors willing to portray criminals as individuals with no redeeming value. For this I would give the movie 5 stars. The only problem is I don't go to the movies for reality, I go to get entertained. If criminals shooting women and chainsawing competitors is your idea of entertainment go for it. It's not mine. I give it two stars. And only because Pacino is so perfect."
3,Eh!,I know it's an old movie but I expected the video quality to be better. It's almost as bad as a bootleg video.
3,overrated,"I saw this movie for the very first time tonight and I have to say it is not that great at all. I'll admit Al Pacino is an amazing actor and he does give a really good performance, but the story is really lacking. I mean, how can we find these people interesting in the first place, he never really showed remorse for becoming what he was towards the end, and as far as violence goes this movie isnt THAT violent. Most of it is the usual lame ""drug talk."" michelle pheifer is good in this movie, but even that cant save it. I give it three stars for the music and the incredible shoot out at the end, but other than that it is not something I would call a ""classic"" however that is an opinion and many others may disagree with me. If you want a good gangster flick with Pacino, check out Carlito's way which was also directed by Brian De palma that is a movie where you can actually notice character build up and you sympathize with what is going on."
2,"Floyd in Akron, OH","I purchased the DVD for my 15 year-old son who likes Al Pacino. When I originally saw this movie, years ago in the theater, I laughed my a** off. It was so full of stereotypes that it was more of a comedy than a serious film. Al Pacino must have really been using coke when he made this movie. It is not in the same league with the Godfather series."
3,I Don't Get It! I Must Have Missed Something...,"Like a lot of people I too was looking foward to the DVD release. It went out of print so when I found one before the anniversary edition I couldn't wait to watch it. What a disapointment! Overlong, Overdone, and overdruged! Pacino is not suited to play this role. He loses his cuban accent so often I don't know why he bothered to try. Depalma's (mis)direction is confusing, Michelle Phieffer is just eye (or nose) candy, and its too campy for its own good. Everyone I know seems to love this movie, but I just don't get it. It's no ""Goodfellas."" Still, it has enough blood, gore, drugs, sex and a terrific musical score to keep interest."
1,Scratching Head,"This is one of those films that you hear about, know a little about, and if you haven't watched, figure you are missing out. I didn't even finish watching. Love Al Pacino, like Michelle P, too, but this was B-movie acting/plot. Wretched accents."
2,reveiw for packaging not scarface itself,"The packaging of this one sucks. There's no booklet no nothing, just a thin ass peice of folded card stock with no slip cover. Its real cheaply made. The limited is better and has the same shit. Scarface itself is amazing and if you don't want your copy to get trashed in two months just go for the hard case limited edition."
5,"Unmistakably, the BEST bad ass, savage movie out there.","Putting all of that whining aside by other reviewers, this is one of THE if not THE best movie of all time. Sure the sound could be better or whatever, there's always room for improvement. Look beyond, and get yourself ready for one of the ultimate masterpieces of all time."
1,Know haw i got dis scar?,"Well i must say that i was downright appalled at the content of this dispecable film, it is a racist attack on the political prisoners of Cuba and is a polliticall attack on communisim.I came to these shores from Havana the same way Tony Montana did and believe that this film is a swipe at me and everything Cuba is good for:1 Cigars2 Kid Napping3 Drugs4 Missiles5 [girls]I believe that this is Al Pacino's worst acting ever and believe me he can stink it up![.]BIGTIMEBut i must admit he has a GREAT ...head all the way ...!And the chainsaw scene, well i've seen more dangerous turkey carvers!!Bye"
2,I forgot how bad this was,"Cheesy, too long and not as bloody as everyone remembers, Scarface is way overrated. Some parts are laugh out loud dated, like the Frank Stallone musical montage and the rear projection car scenes. The first half of the movie as Tony comes to power works better then the latter drug soaked parts.The DVD is of high quality and still worth a watch."
1,One of the Most Offensive Movies in History,"When I saw this one, I was ""blown away!"" I could not believe that an actor of Pacino's level would lower himself to such a blatantly racist and sexist bit of filmmaking.Maybe, it was the big paycheck! Or was it the lack of dialogue that the actor had to learn? I would love for someone to let me know how many times the actor uttered a certain four-letter expletive that begins with an ""F"" in this film. I lost count!The fact that the major characters were supposedly Puerto Rican makes the casting of Pacino, Loggia, Mastrantonio, and Bauer a major faux pas!I could never understand why this one did not receive an ""X"" for its violent content and misogynistic depiction of women. Ultra violent in its final frames, the film is unbearably BAD.And that ain't GOOD!"
3,not the 1930s scarface,"it become readily evident that this was not the same story that came on tcm a few weeks ago.however,oliver stone made this one about these cuban dudes running drugs.scarface is the heartless gangster type who doesnt take crap frim anybody.even whenhe was just a little nobody fresh off the boat.theres a lot of shooting and gang violence so all you sell outs will love it.this scarface guy is a real tough guy and its cool watching him go from nowhere to the top of the world."
2,violence on steroids,"Can you say violent? I lost count of the bloody murders after the 15th slaughter in this movie. I'm no prude, but when you have killing for the sake of killing it gets a bit ridiculous. And using f**k every other word gets a bit tiring after the 100th usage of the word. Even Michelle Pfeiffer's character agrees with me. At the end it said the move was dedicated to Ben Hecht and Howard Hawks. It should have been dedicated to Quentin Tarantino. Hawks and Hecht would turn over in their graves if they saw what passed as a ""slight"" remake of their classic. This movie is like the original in only the title. Al Pacino is a great actor, but compared to his classic jobs in the Godfather and Serpico, he should be ashamed, and this was almost 30 years ago this bloody joke was made. The gore was way over the top(the blood fests by Tarantino were Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by comparison). If you want to see a classic, don't rent or buy this movie. It isn't worth it."
2,dvd review,"I'm not going to talk about the movie since I asume all who are reading this know how good this movie already is. This is going to be a review about the quality of the Anniversary Edition dvd. To start off the video quality as compared to the original dvd has been much improved but there are some scenes where the image looks very dusty and dark. The sound??? Well that's my bigget letdown about this dvd. They advertise 5.1 surround with DTS but I just don't hear it. Most of the shootouts and explosions come from the center channel. Where is the surround sound?? As for the extras, besides the Def Jam segment, they are the same as the original dvd. The only impressive change to this disk are the animated menues. I LOVE SCARFACE but I expected so much more from this dvd. I would hope for future posts about dvd reviews focus on the quality of the disks and extras that are contained in them."
5,best movie ever!!!!!!!!,this was a great buy it alsow comes whith the original scarface in reguler dvd and additinal post cards from the movie
5,he got it all and died next,great gangsta movie VERY FEW compare to this its a perfect action thriller and it gets better and better as the movie progressesexcellent shoot em up at the end
5,Should have won an Oscar,This to me is one of the best if not the best Al Pacino movie. I beleive it should have won an Oscar. This is a brilliant acting job by my favorite actor Al Pacino. This DVD should be in everyones DVD library.
5,One of the Best movies of 80's,"Where to begin... Well the first time I saw this picture I was in the 8th grade and was completely mesmerized by it. I mean the performance by Mr. Pacino is by far the best in his illustrious career. From the first words that Tony utters in opening scene ""Antonio Montana"" to the incredible ending, the performance leaves one wanting more. The movie is long but does not feel like its length. I agree with the some of the comments made earlier about the DVD,- in terms of poor sound quality. But I think that is small price to pay for all the extra benefits of the package. The behind the scenes documentary is must see for all fans as well as the deleted scenes. The trailers to this movie were awful. It's no wonder the movie did not do well at the box office in its initial release.(plus the terrible reviews and controversey did not help) I think that for any guy growing up in the late 80's early 90's, this was mandatory viewing. Highly recommended for all."
2,"""Scarface"" an overlong mess","Brian De Palma's Scarface looked like the new Godfather when it came out. It had the guns, gangsters, and underground business themes that The Godfather dealt with. But it really turns out to be an overlong, somewhat boring, mess. We get to know none of the charachters, they've all split or gotten killed after just ten minutes of screentime, yet they are a big deal to the story. We can feel no sympathy whatsoever for Pacino like we are supposed to, and as for the music? It makes you feel just like you are watching a dragging episode of Miami Vice, with the theme song playing throughout the show. It could have been so much more, but it's just an overlong mess."
3,"""Platinum"" edition?","Oh, please.This isn't a friggin' rap album. It's a gangster movie that, unfortunately, was completely exploited over these past few years by the scum of the earth: the overground hip-hop community. I hate how Universal didn't treat this movie with the respect it deserved until some brainless parasites turned it into a marketing gimmick for rappers' ""street cred.""I love this movie, but I hate what it's come to stand for. Thanks, rappers, for knocking down yet another peg in American culture."
5,SAY HELLO TO MA LIL' FRIEND!',"This is the best gang movie ever. Back then, the directors had to fight with the MPAA to get an ""R"" instead of an ""X""! This follows the life of a gangster who becomes the king of crime. He has everything. Al Pacino makes a perfect lead role.The deluxe gift set is worth your money. It contains both Scarface movies (includuding the one by Howard Hughes) and 2 discs on the 1983 one and 2 discs on the Howard Hughes version. So buy it!"
4,awsome movie. crappy bonus materials.,"im going to keep this simple. this movie is completely awsome. if you don't already have the VHS version, buy it. if u already do, dont bother. if this film was really digitally remastered, they did a crap job, as the picture quality doesn't look any better than the VHS version at all. as for the 5.1 surround sound, all it really is is the volume turned up alittle.4 stars for the movie2 stars for the dvd (at least the menu is cool)"
5,Great Movie but TV version on the 2nd disc has a glitch!!!,"There is no doubt that this is still a great movie 20 years after it was first released. Even though I was too young to watch it when it was first released in theatres, it is one of my favorite movies of all time. However, I do have one complaint about the DVD and that is the TV version section on the 2nd disc is out of sync with the audio, which is unfortunate since all of the other features are ok. I've already exchanged the DVD twice but the glitch is still there. I hope that it's fixed in the near future."
4,No guts no glory!,Anyway... couldn't wait for it so I got one from a local book store! man its a classic!
5,Scarface,"I just ordered Scarface over the Internet. It is bootlegged, but I don't care, as long as I have the movie. I will buy the aniversery edition this September. I was truly amazed with this film, it was powerful because of Pacino's acting. This film is similar to Grand Theft Auto Vice City. It is like a clone of the film, with different characters. Both mansions are very similar, the cars are similar, the characters, and even the night club. I recommend this film to any Al Pacino fan, or any fan to great american films. This movie rivals the Godfather series, and is better than Godfellas. If you like Pacino you would like the 1973 film Serpico."
5,the best of all time,this movie is the absolute best film...no one can keep you attention for four hours like tony montana.
5,Great Movie,"Scarface is a great movie. I would say that it is one of, if not the best gangster/drug movies of all time. It is a remake of a true story of Al Capone. Al Pacino plays Scarface, aka Tony Montana. He is a Cuban immigrant who immigrates to Florida as part of the people that Castro released. This time was known as the Cuban crime wave. Tony works his way to the top of the world by killing and selling. The movie is very realistic, except for the ending, where he should have died much sooner. Overall, this movie is a classic. If you like gangster/drug movies, you will love this one. I highly recommend purchasing this film."
1,Overrated And Stupid,This movie is overrated and Al Pacino's performance is too phony. See The Godfather films instead.
3,So Real,"I thought I was going to be the only person to give Scarface less than 5 stars...Of course stunningly acted by Pacino. However, the overall feel of the movie is pretty tattered. Like Terminator it shows its age in score, cinematography, and direction.With the recent batch of 3 hour epics it is possible to capture and maintain the attention of an audience for the whole picture. Most of what people remember of Scarface are snippets of action, often misquoted.I don't intend to turn anyone away with these thoughts, just set you up for what to expect."
4,hard to sit through but a classic,"This is a very disturbing movie as we all so very know but it was a piece of art. You have to really have guts to watch this film. Al Pacino is the ultimate cuban gangster. One thing about this movie that I think made it so famous was that it was the most violent film of all time. Watch it once every five years because if you watch it a whole lot than that is not good for you. This director sure did make a realistic disturbing classic. Being a christian, this was difficult to sit hrough. I do like the line where Al says "" say hello to my little friend"". That is one of the greatest lines of all times. Buy it only if you have the guts and stomach. God bless you and America."
2,once again oliver stone ruins another great plot,this movie was too slow!pacino was great holding the cuban accent the whole time must have been hard.but oliver stone ruined the movie.
5,Kill me if you can!,This is the best movie of Al Pacino. I have never seen anything like this before. It is a perfect example of how tough life and money making is.
2,#161 on IMDb top 250?i don't think so. it's not in my top 250(2.5/5),"wow,what a disappointment.i had high hopes for this movie.i had heard it was great.and it was directed by Brian De Palma with a screenplay by Oliver Stone.not to mention it's rated #161 of the top 250 on IMDb so far,so good,right?wrong.for me,this is a decent movie but nothing more.it never really engaged me.i wasn't bored necessarily,but i wasn't overly interested either.the acting did very little for me,except for Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio,who i thought was exceptional as Gina Montana.there were some good actors here,but i feel they were wasted. Al Pacino wasn't really impressive.also,this was supposed to be controversial movie,but i have seen a lot worse in terms of both violence and language.anyway,i would certainly not place this movie in my top 250 movies of all time.it doesn't have the impact of the original 1932 version.for me,Scarface is a 2.5/5"
2,Scarface,"If your a fan of the ""F"" word this movies for you!, if your a fan of good cinema stick with the 1932 ver."
3,hellbound,"Scarface, done by mr. De Palma. Al Pacino stars in this classic movie of coming out on top in the drug world. Tony Montana (pacino) arrives in amercia trying to make it big, and in the 70's there is only one way to get to the top and fast. Overall the film is well done for the technology at the time. The subtle yet emotional movements of the camera as well as the depressing ans somewhat eery music creates a good atmosphere and gives added feeling to the characters. The acting was weel played off and i was even led to believe that these people werw who they were acting. All in all this was a good film and i do recomend people go to rent this for them selves. I hope many people down the line in years can enjoy and appreciate a classic like this one."
5,"More of a question, as opposed to a review","Seriously, could someone please tell me why all these hip-hop, poser clowns have attached themselves to this film? Sorry, but none of you have the remotest thing in common with Tony Montegna. You probably couldn't even name another Brian DePalma film. I didn't buy the last ""special"" edition because of the ridiculous Def Jam ""rappers waxing 'poetic' about Scarface"" DVD. What a joke! But then again, hip hop culture is a joke, so what do you expect.Anyway, this DVD is great and the movie is great. What else is there to say? This movie is atmospheric and stands the test of time."
2,What remastering?,"The digital video transfer and 5.1 DTS surround sound they said would be included in this DVD was a complete lie. The sound is just as horrible as it was in the original DVD, as you hear ""pops"" for gun shots and explosions. And the video is just as grainy and dark. It's truly a shame that such a great movie can be tainted with such a horrible DVD. If you have the original DVD, I wouldn't waste your money or get your hopes up on this DVD."
4,"Good movie, but a bit overdone.","Fine acting, fine plot, great cast of characters and pretty friggen' violent. That combo is the formula for an entertaining movie, but when an ending is as overdone as it is in Scarface, I have to be critical. I don't want to reveal much, but let me tell you now, if you watch it all the way through, be prepared for a wild ride of excessive violence and mayhem. Pacino's shootout could have been a little shorter and more realistic. He had over 50 guys shooting at him at the same time, and the only time he got hit was when the arch rival shot him in the back! The chainsaw scene was a little extreme for sensitive viewers, but I feel that it was neccisary. All-in-all, it is a good film that shows the harmful truth about the life that crime and murder will provide in shockingly grotesque and extreme detail. Good to rent, or if you are a big Al Pacino fan, buy. PS, if I could, I would give it 4 and a half stars."
2,Did I miss something?,"I must be that one guy in America that didn't like this movie. I guess this just wasn't my style or something, I just don't see what's so fascinating about it, this was *barely entertaining, let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history.It's about a guy that came from nothing, and goes on to become a drug lord. Pretty simple way to describe an entire movie, and that's exactly my feeling about the entire movie. Contrary to what a lot of people think, just because a movie is about mafias/drug trade/criminal groups doesn't automatically make it a great movie, don't forget good storytelling."
5,Say Hello to my little friend!,"Are you kidding me? At this day and age, Scarface does not need a review! No real man collection is complete without this movie. If you don't have it, tell no one...order it now then invite friends over after it arrives. Do it now!"
5,You Think You Can Kill Me With Bullets?!!!,"Just like Tony Montana, this movie will resist a long time before it can get beaten...if it gets beaten.A crime masterpiece from start to finish...the story is savage and the characters are awesome.Tony Montana, Manolo ""Manny"" Rivera, Chi Chi and Angel were four cubans that got the chance to experience the american dream.They didn't all make it. From his beginnings as a cook in a latin food spot to his domain of power built by the drug business, Tony Montana is one amazing character to watch, played perfectly by Al Pacino...he takes no crap from no one and turned himself into a guy so secure of himself to the point of believing he didn't need his friends or wife no more.Truly, a fascinating story to watch, sprinkled with good dialogue, wild action and sometimes brutal violence (the infamous chain saw scene) this highly entertaining film belongs in any DVD collection."
5,Tony Montana Lives!,"This movie defined an era in 80's Miami that ring so true, as a child of Cuban American parents and living in at the one time small city ,might have fictionalized characters but the story tells it like it was. NOt only that, but prompt the character Tony Montana to icon status. The movie was protested and boycotted in Miami for its poor potrayal of Cubans at the time but in Fidel's Mariel Boatlift it rang nothing but truth, Miami is small no more still fast, flashy and furious in a very discreet and low key manner making this movie the birth of the urban and hip hop communities in Miami. I love it just for what it is an over the top violent fictional true story."
3,Original Scarface on DVD!,"It is thrilling to see Howard Hawks' original 1932 'Scarface' on DVD, even though one has to buy a gaudy box and DePlma's tasteless remake as part of the deal. Oh well... I read though a couple of dozen of reviews and was astonished to realize that most of the people are not even going to bother to give the original a second look and only going to watch a remake. It is really a shame and shows how the taste in movies and appreciation for fines things has declined with time. 5 stars for the original, 1 star for the remake and a ridiculous packaging. The average is 3 stars."
3,Dissapointed,"Let me begin by saying that the movie itself deserves 5 stars. Having said that I admit to being very dissapointed with this release. I bought this version mainly because of the remastered video and sound. The video is excellent, crisp, clear and dynamic..a definite improvement over the original dvd. The sound on the other hand..ugh! The mix done on this is just terrible, I am not exxagerating. They say it's in DTS 5.1 and they're lying...most of the time everything comes from the center channel and muffled at that...what little surround effects there are ( they are few and far between )also sound muffled. I put in my original release copy and in Dolby 2.0 it sounded 10 times better than this new version.In closing...if you don't care about sound quality and just want an excellent movie pick it up...but if you care at all about the sound..AVOID."
2,"Great film, Shameful DVD","By now I'm sure you know the story, so I won't rehash what we already know : This is a GREAT film ... And a film as epic as SCARFACE deserves an equally awesome treatment on DVD, right ??? .... Well, the folks who put this trasnsfer out should be ashamed: it's the worst looking DVD I've seen..., and it really distracts from the overall impact of the film ... Grainy, pixelated and washed out, SCARFACE isn't allowed to shine the way it should ... Rent before you buy, and for hardcore fans, hope that eventually the true definitive version will be released ..."
3,"Quality film, nice extras, poor transfer to DVD","I won't speak to the quality of the film: Many others here have done so, and the debate will rage whether it's a modern masterpiece or overblown tripe.Suffice to say that it *is* a significant film, and that the extras on this DVD are quite nice (outtakes, interviews).However -- and this is a BIG however -- the quality of this transfer to DVD leaves a lot to be desired. It really looks like they simply took the old composite master for the LD release and used it for the DVD. The colors bleed into one another, and solid color areas are often murky and noisy. This can be verified on any well-calibrated NTSC monitor, using a quality DVD player connected via component cables."
5,My Scarface ReviewL,"I gave this move a 5 rating,because i think this movie is the best movie that Pacino has worked on. I feel that Scarface is the best movie ever made about the subject it talks about. And its just a classic gangster movie. Every one who likes movies should watch this movie because its one of the best movies ever. The first time I seen this movie i felt in love with it and i just had to watch it again and again. This movie perfectly describes the life of a Cuban refugee who started at the bottom of the mountain,but as time passed he started moving up on the mountain and finally reached the top. Tony Montana did stuff his own way never taking nothing from nobody and always doing what he thought was right. But at the end doing stuff his own way cought up to him and he lost all he ever loved his sister and his own life. I really recommend this movie because I think its the the best."
5,You will love this classic!,"No I'm not a rapper or even a fan of rap music, but I still love Scarface. I won't get into the plot since everyone has already. Let me just say that he plot is simple but it lures you in and doesn't let go until those closing credits begin to roll. I've always loved Al Pacino and I have to say that this is his best performance! The movie is gritty and violent but hey that's the world Tony Montana lives in so don't expect anything sweet and rosey. You have been warned. Also I wish these ignorant rappers would stop comparing themselves to Tony Montana, they're nothing but a bunch of wannabes and need to find their own niche. You guys aren't Tony and you never will be. That whole Def Jam crap is the only thing that ruins this DVD, just pretend it doesn't exist and enjoy everything else."
3,searching for explanation,could anyone tell me the difference between the two scarface two disc editons...the platinum and the anniversary? which one is better?
2,"** for region 1 DVD, ***** for region 2 DVD","The region 1 is disaster, get the region disc it's much better transfer and print quality is the best i've seen for scaface. good extras on both though. I wish De Palma would do commentary"
5,Great Quality,This DVD is of great quaility and it arrived before scheduled. This is one of my favorite movies that I had to replace in my collection.
5,Oye conyo,Classic hit on blue-ray!!! Must have in collection. Great price fast shipping Say hello to my little friend!!! Greed is a failure of a CEO !!!!!!
1,Some of the Worst Acting Ever,"I tried to watch this movie. Even overlooked the ever present and over used ""F"" word. What I could not overlook was the terrible acting and accent of Al Pacino. Turned it off after about 45 minutes. Sorry. Just do not see how this could ever rate 5 stars."
1,The start of total decadence?,"I'm sorry, but I saw this film in the theatre and couldn't get by all the swearing. No character could get through a single sentence without saying the f word. Bad language in films was common, but not to this degree. I think this film was a breakthrough and led Hollywood to think cussing is essential. It is not! I don't go to theatres any more and I avoid modern movies so as to miss this assault on my ears. It's no wonder young people talk in this manner in ordinary speech. They use the f word in every sentence no matter who's within listening distance. A sad commentary on the decline of morals. As for the movie, I found it boring, too long and the ending was absurd."
3,Scarface 058 90621223464512,Dear sellerI enjoy scarface except that there are two thick black lines on the screen do you have one that has a completly full clear screen?thanks- Joan
2,GRAPHIC VIOLENCE - WEAK PLOT,"I've heard Al Pacino say many times that he is most proud of his performance in this movie. While he's got the accent down, his performance is hampered by heavy-handed diection and too much gratuitous violence courtesy of Oliver Stone. The infamous chainsaw scene is disgusting and completely unnecessary. The movie goes downhill from there. The final scene is ridiculous."
3,Diss ees a gray mobie mang,I think the movie is only truly enjoyable as a demented version of I Love Lucy... but that's me.
2,Say hello to my little friend,Where was the cops during this movie. Tony brutally shot a gangster in the street and got away with it. He then blows away a mansion full of cubans carrying Sub-Machine guns.WHERE'S THE REALNESS
2,"A ""seventies film""","I have no idea why this film is so praised.But then admittedly I have a problem with older films, especially from the seventies. It may be the lack of work with the pictures, they tend to look like documentaries."
1,bad,"Pacino started over-acting with this role, and he's never calmed down since. The beautifully underplayed and nuanced performances like his Micael Corleone were regrettably never to be seen again from here on out. De Palma does what he can with the material. What totally sinks this movie is Oliver Stone's piece-of-junk script. It is just an awful screenplay. Oliver Stone is a lousy writer anyway, but he's even lousier than usual with this movie. I so wanted to enjoy this film, and I couldn't believe how bad it was, and couldn't believe that it was ever funded to begin with."
5,Easy buy!,"I chose five stars for timely shipping, non damaged packing and great free gift wrap. I could talk about how great the movie is or the quality of the picture but we all know its amazing and it's a blu-ray which does any movie justice. Arrived on time and in great condition. THATS what matters in this review."
4,"""One Of Pacino's Best!""",Al Pacino and more star in Brian De Palma's 1983 crime dramaremake of the 1932 film. A Cuban rises as a powerful Miamidrug-dealer. This is definitely one of Pacino's best with agreat cast and excellent score by Georgio Moroder. This2-disc set has good picture and sound plus neat extras.I recommend this classic for your collection.
5,Everyone's Wise Second Dad,Such joy in living simply. Mr. Rogers had a way of bringing people in with his ordinariness. His philosophy is one of love and positive thinking. He separates true happiness from temporary satisfactions. This is a must read.
5,Great powerplant book,"One of a couple of technical powerplant books I needed for my degree, Glencoe has fantastic info for the mechanically curious pilot. You aren't going to rebuild an engine with this, but it covers EVERYTHING about the engines that keep you in the air. Highly recommended for pilots who want to know more about their aircraft."
5,GREAT COMIC BOOK,"This is a great book filled with funny stories from the 50's. Arrived perfectly, quickly and eventhough it is a second hand book, it looks as new."
4,From father to daughter,"I loved ""Archie"" comics as a kid, reading them in the '60s and early '70s, as well as reprints of early comics from the '50s. When I look at them today my mind quickly wanders. Although I actually remember some stories and situations with fondness I'm simply too old to be entertained by them now.However my daughter is the perfect age (12) for ""Archie"" and loves not only the new ones, but the old ones too. I had some of my old comics to give her and she's been enjoying these reprint series as well. The art may change, Riverdale may be more culturally diverse, and Big Ethel may merely be Ethel now, but if my daughter is any indication, her children and her grandchildren will be enjoying these same comics in the years to come."
5,"An excellent book, worth digging for","This is a fine book It covers arbitration, etc. intelligently, yet understandably. The author gives you excellent advice on saving on legal bills, yet doesn't rant about lawyers. This is a credible piece of work."
2,Not Recommended,"My husband bought this for me as a stocking stuffer; unfortunately, I didn't even get to benefit from it at all. The batteries went dead after it repeatedly switched on by itself in my purse. I would of course shut it off if I spotted that but I think this happened too many times. I had this light linked to my key chain. You can't even replace its batteries- seems to be a one time use instrument. I'm so disappointed in its poor design =(. I've replaced this with a Solitaire Mag Instrument now and I am a lot happier. While the concept of having a small nearly weightless light is great, they must re-think this design."
3,Bit expensive,"It does what it advertises, the beam of light is very bright. It shows up pretty well on dark roads and I haven't had a glitch before. The button to keep it on is a bit hard to use, but you just have to press and slide a few times until it works."
5,Beautiful !,"I've just end up reading The Bopping Elf and now i'm too impressed to give any comments or even to write anything understandable..I worship everything beautiful, and i worship this book now. I spent wonderful time, reading it under the sound of early Marc's albums, going from smiles to tears and from joy to sorrow... - Sammy, Russia (Till Dawn)"
3,Dante's: The Devine Comedy,"This printing of this classic work seems to be over abridged. As someone who has read other versions, this work seems to be a good starting point for getting into the heavy work. Yet, it is little better than a more indepth Cliff Note."
5,"If ""Before Night Falls"" caught you.....","Hopefully the successful audience response to the film of Arenas' ""Before Night Falls"" will encourage readers to explore the unique and vastly enriching glimpses of Castro's (or any dictator's for that matter) Cuba. The author's style is indelibly his own, reporting and commenting on the conditions of political supression, whether he elects to satirize in the first person/s as in ""Color of Summer"" with its over the edge surreal view of contemporary Cuba, or placing the narrator from within as in ""The Assault"". Truth, as he viewed it, is so ludicrous that it becomes black comedy, not unlike Goya's ""Goyescas"". But for all the unsettling details of this tale of destruction of all that matters in our past, this book, once read burns a spot in our minds that makes it almost necessary to revisit it lest we forget the joy of freedom. Tough reading, but highly recommended."
4,Painful and creative,"Tells the tale of the terror of totalitarianism. People are as animals. Life is a joyless, horror. Life is dark, miserable, and full of pain. Despite the completely terrible nature of the story it is extremely creative and a good read. Read in just one day. Marvelous."
4,"great songs, bad mixing","Basslines is one of the best speed garage albums you can buy. What makes the album so great is the succession of fantastic tracks. Standouts include ultrafunkula, the line and love commandments. The reason Basslines does not receive 5 stars is simple- poor mixing. Songs do not blend effortlessly into one another, as they do on better compilations. Further, the last few tracks on the album are HORRIBLE. With vocals like ""You are the new generation"" repeated over and over in a chipmunk-esque fashion, and ""Here comes the bassline"" making an otherwise flawless album slightly cheesey. Nevertheless, fans of speed garage and house will thoroughly enjoy this album."
2,Buyer Beware!,"Anyone interested in a DVD playback solution should not consider this card! After purchasing, I was plagued by a host of problems, including a very well documented error that up to 60% of all users under windows 98 may encounter! The only solution presented by the manufacturer was to download and install drivers for a rival company's DVD player and card!!! After all of this hassle, there was NO FULL SCREEN playback mode to be found, and additionally, the unit crashed each and every time a VCD was inserted. The product clearly states compatibility with VCD 1.0 and 2.0, as well as SVCD. Simply put, this card does not even come close to delivering the promised performance or features! Very, very disappointing."
1,NOT for Professionals,"This is a VERY basic program. There is no way to see thumbnails of previous images along with a large window of the current captured image (as in Capture One software). Also, the capture window is very small. The only way to see other images that you have taken during a session is to use the image viewer. The only buttons for moving through the files are forward or back. So you have to go through all of your files to get to a specific one. Also, it takes at least 15 seconds for each image to come up in the viewer. So imagine how long it takes to go back five images! SLOW, SLOW, SLOW!This software will slow down your workflow immensely and is very cumbersome to use. I do not recommend it as there is more advanced software on the market."
4,Control your camera from your computer,Works basically as advertised. Could be better designed interface. Lots of different windows need to be open to get the work flow right. Ridiculously expensive for what it does. This product should either come with higher end Nikon cameras or cost $50 max. At almost $200 Nikon is gouging its best customers. If you are looking for a deal on this buy the 1.0 version and then get the 2.0 upgrade.
1,"Very little meat, no potatoes","A ""handbook"" this isn't. Scanning the Table of Contents one would expect a plethora of fresh insight and guidelines on starting a business. Unfortunately the content is sparse at best. Ninety percent of the subjects are confined to one page of large double-spaced print and several consisted of only four ludicrously common-sense sentences. For example, the section entitled ""Why a Business Plan?"" consists of four sentences with the last one being ""Do not neglect this important step."" The only redeeming value is that the chapters titled ""Insurance"" and ""Company Policies"" remind the reader of a couple of important issues that are often missed by other ""handbooks"". Sorry, but this book is not for the serious start-up entrepreneur."
3,Glad I read it,"Tom shared some good tips that have made him successful, however I did not feel his style of writing flowed well for me.."
5,Nothing new here...but an awsome concept.,Many books push hardcore tactics that literally force the sale to happen. This book helps explains how his easy to use ideas and concepts help or collabratively make sales happen. It is all in how you ask-ask-ask.
5,A Must Read !,"If you're into executions ,this is a great one & another is Executioner: Pierrepoint an autobiography, published by: Eric Dobby isbn 1-85882-061-8 .About Albert Pierrepoint, Englands last Official Hangman,very engrossing & both books hard to put down once you've started reading them."
1,Save it for the nerds,Publishers ought to realize that people buy computer books because they want topics explained to them in plain terms that they can understand. This book is very poorly written. I can't count the number of times I scratched my head and had to read instructions over again to try to interpret what the author was saying.Save this one for nerds.
4,don dadda run things,"well, i am a huge supercat fan so if you are missing any of the tunes, it mabe worth the buy; as for the cobra, well it is hit or miss.."
4,Pretty good,"This backpack is pretty much what I expected. The thermal part of the bag seems pretty small, but I am usually able to fit all of my lunch into it, at least the parts that need to be kept cold. The big pocket is actually large enough to carry everything I need as well, which surprised me. The only drawback is I wish the bag had more pockets. Other than that I'm really glad I bought it."
2,So-so experience,"A try at a completely unknown for me. The sample tidbits were the encouraging factor in selecting this artist. So far, I've lacked a listener's stamina to get through listening to this whole offering. Too heavy for me."
3,A weird little action adventure,"Mack Bolan hits London as he tears through the European Mafia. When he becoomes involved in the Mob's attempt to take over a sex club, the going gets weird. Our man Bolan finds himself in a diabolical trap which may involve a fate worse than death. A truly unique ending in his adventures."
3,Not the best,"I like the whole series, but this one is not the best. The war wagon starts to bring out better results"
2,Not what I expected,This was not what I expected. It was a great price and in good shape. This book is more of a teachers book and now a everyday book for a 4th graded.
1,Not what I thought,This is not the revised addition and does not even include a section on visual arts for which I was buying it!
4,Helpful Tool,"We bought this to use with our daughter who just started fourth grade. We used the third grade version this summer and were pleased enough with it to give this one a try. As with the other, the history portions were well written and easy for her to understand. The choices for poetry and literature are just unusual enough for her to be interested in. If I were homeschooling, I wouldn't rely on this alone, but it does make a very helpful and handy tool for suplimenting a public school education."
5,What Your Fourth Grader Needs To Know,"Essential knowledge for all fourth graders.My daughter could not wait to receive.Perfect condition, as described, fast shippingGreat price."
3,Didn't really use,"I purchased this book as a new homeschooler. I wouldn't say there is anything wrong with this book, it's just hard to use when you have everything else going on as well. It does cover many subjects, briefly, but doesn't go as in depth as you'd like or follow a natural pattern of learning. You could use this, but I suspect many new homeschoolers buy these fearing they'll miss something. In reality, they probably browse through this book and move on to something else."
5,TAKE YOUR VITAMINS,"Consider E.D. Hirsch's book a cultural multi-vitamin. That is, you might eat well, but to be on the safe side a wide-spectrum tablet will fill in any undiagnosed nutritional gaps. Similarly, E.D. Hirsch has written a series of indispensable books that will supplement a youngster's curricular deficiencies. Every parent, every teacher should purchase, ""What Your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th Grader (and so on) Needs to Know."""
1,waste of time - read AYN RAND!,"I am writing this primarily to warn people from wasting their time with this book. I would write an exhaustive explanation of why this book is so bad, but I don't want to waste any more of my own time with this book. For an excellent book, read either THE FOUNTAINHEAD by Ayn Rand or ATLAS SHRUGGED by Ayn Rand. Actually, read *both* of them!"
4,Digesting China Men,"After having finished the book, I found that the middle part was really hard to get through for me. The multitude of characters involved made it difficult to be emotionally attached to any one character. It was interesting, however, to see Kingston's father transform from the ""Father from China"" to the ""Father from America"". I thought that was probably the most interesting journey of all the characters in the novel. There have been many criticisms on whether it is right for Kingston to interpret traditional Chinese stories in her own way and almost make whole new stories out of them. I don't agree with those criticism because I think she has the right to modernize those stories in order to help readers be able to understand the stories more. I actually like her personal tellings of the traditional stories. They definitely enhanced the reading experience of the book and made me think more about the longer stories of the novel."
3,Good combination of history and entertainment,"This is an entertaining book telling about the author's family. It was disconcerting at first because of the disconnected stories, but once I caught on to how the book was written, it was very enjoyable. There should be a preface put in telling how the separate stories work. Maxine Hong Kingston works the myths and legends into her book very well. I enjoyed these as much as the stories themselves."
5,New company,This is a really new sound for electric company. On studio city it's mad chaos. Now on this album it's more warm and fuzzy. His music reminds of a negative that has been over exposed. I Think this is possibly his best release to date.
2,Disappointing,"I like Tom De Haven's work (his Derby Dugan trilogy is great) and was intrigued that this took place in my home town, Jersey City (where De Haven used to live). Though the illustrations captured the local color of JC, the plot is a mess. Any mystery that hinges on repressed memory as a major plot devise is going to have problems. It comes across as a stupid way to move things along. Surely a writer of De Haven's abilities could have come up with something better. This feels like he wrote it in an hour."
3,"well, it is Panacea","Really, you know what you are going to get when you buy a Panacea album. I did not like this album as much as ""Low Profile Darkness"" and ""Phoenix Metabolism"", but it is still good. Not too much stuff like it now. Since the unfortunate downfall of darkstep, It is getting pretty rare to find new music like this, you have to head up to the faster Breakcore; jungle is sutck in jump up/hardstep again."
2,can't come up with original sounds,"panacea from the beginning has been too lazy to come up with original sounds. you can hear rips from all the better artists.current value, his friend, is a lot better - i have never heard the guy sample from another artist, all the sounds are fresh and new"
2,Hardcore - maybe not,"Deemed ""hardcore D&B"", I seem to feel this record out as a sampling of other artists records and integrated with dead, motionless beats and industrial strength noises. This has a lot to do with German music, as they seem to be able to only produce high BPM low-emotional fieldings. If you really wanted Hardcore, you wouldn't waste your time with this album and move straight onto original, quality content... Digital Hardcore Recordings."
5,Good book,"This is a great book that included some great stories about Ben Franklin. The book described his life, business and personal affairs in details. I recommend this book to everyone."
5,Comprehensive Ridington Genealogy,"Bill Clink's Ridington genealogy was a labour of love. It is comprehensive and definitive. For those family members reading this review, you might be interested in learning that I have inherited the original Thomas Tregoning Ridington bible with family history inscriptions. You can contact me at ridington@gulfislands.com. Robin Ridington RR 2 Galiano, BC Canada. 250-539-3095."
2,What a disappointment!,"I've read two of this author's western historical romances, and enjoyed them both. However, this is the second of her series titles I've read (the other was the second in this series - AND THEN HE KISSED ME - and both struck me as incredibly superficial and unrealistic.I realize now that most of that comes from the particular series line this was written for, but it's hard to believe two people would decide in the year 2000 to get married after one (or possibly two) kisses.I do recommend this author's historical releases, though, so if you can find WINTER BRIDE (a good mail order bride romance) or BLACKSTONE'S BRIDE, try them instead.TTFN, Laurie Likes BooksPublisher, All About Romance"
4,Adventure!,"This book reminded me much of the work of Edgar Rice Burroughs. It borrows heavily from the tradition set forth by Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and follows the tradition of Verne and especially Burroughs in conceiving a plot that moves inexorably forward. The primary characters feature some depth, some motive for their actions, and even the secondary characters are more than just flat extras. The dialogue is realistic, and the details paint a vivid picture of the characters and the action. It's a real page turner."
5,Getting Partnering Right,"I am in the process of establishing partnerships with our firm's suppliers and subcontractors so that we may improve the service that we provide to our customers. The first step in the process is to be sure that our suppliers and subcontractors understand the concept of partnering for a win-win agreement. ""Getting Partnering Right"" is by far the best explanation of what I am trying to accomplish that I have read.After an initial meeting, I ask our potential partner to read the book and to call me when he has read it.Without exception, all have stated that ""Now I get it"". In a follow-up interview it is very easy to tell if they really do ""get it"". So far I have purchsed 28 copies for distribution to potential partners and to some our own employees. In addition,some of our partners have purchased more copies for distribution within their own companies. Maybe this one should be rated 6 stars!!"
1,Much better books out there...,"Like another reviewer said, the facts are just kind of tossed out there without much in the way of explanation. The written practice tests in the back of the book are some of the worst I have ever seen. Many of them are obtuse in the extreme; they will have you scratching your head wondering if they were written with any concept of reinforcing knowledge, or just simply to make you feel stupid and/or impress his DBA buddies.Pass on this one."
5,Baci Perugina,This is our favorite chocolate! We grew up on this as kids and I was so happy to find it here on Amazon. We always had Baci's around for the holidays. What a treat! Chocolate and hazelnut; really delicious.
5,decadent!,bought this as a Valentine's Day gift for my sister and we BOTH enjoyed it! The special notes are soul satisfying.
5,Delicioso,"I bought this for my mother for Christmas, since I knew she loved this brand. She enjoyed the chocolates very much and is very thankful for the gift.The shipping was smooth and easy, but don't remember how fast it came (on time I'm assuming). I would buy this again."
4,Tasty treats,"I enjoyed this product. It has a rich dark taste, contrasted by the hazelnuts. The product arrived on time and neatly packaged. This makes a lovely, elegant gift."
3,Bac Perugina Candy,This candy was a gift following my vacation to Italy. I ordered boxes of candy as it was too hard to bring back enough gifts for friends in my travels. The candy was listed as Italian Chocolate but a friend I gave it to said she noticed that it said made by Nestle Chocolates on the back of the box. That was embarrassing. She said the chocolate was good but tasted familiar which is why she noticed the Nestle manufacture.
5,Perugina Baci is a very good chocolate,"These hazelnut chocolates are very good. The box is pretty and romantic (Baci = a kiss or kisses in Italian). Sometimes I do not wait for my husband to get these for me (anniversary and Valentine's Day). In addition to special occasions, once or twice a year I order these chocolates ""from me to me"" and share them only with my very best friends."
5,Favorite Christmas CD!,"I love this cd! I had it on cassette but that became outdated. I looked for it at other sites and only found it here. Freddie Jackson delivers the christmas spirit so well on this cd. I have listened to certain songs on the repeat button, but the whole cd is worth listening to. I highly recommend it."
4,"A great book for those seeking peace, direction and calmness","I saw a part of Dr. Dyer's seminar on the Learning Channel one night and I knew that I had to get this book. It took me some time to read it, not because it was hard to read, but because it was so interesting that I had to take notes on the side and highlight certain sections. It is a great book if you are looking for peace in your life, a new direction and calmness. The priciples are nothing new but there are things that we take for granted for example the pricinple of positivity. We tend to concentrate our full energy on the negative aspects of life and our loved ones. When in reality what we are doing is attracting negativity and bringing it upon ourselves. How can we expect good things to happen to us if our thoughts and our aura are filled with negativity???This is a book that you need to read several times to grasp every time around different concepts and new meanings that can enlighten your life."
1,"Depressing, upsetting book that I don't know why he wrote","I bought this book because it was supposed to tell an uplifting story. I've bought numerous Wayne Dyer books and tapes before, and always loved his message. This book intregued me, so I went ahead and read it. The only conclusion I came up with was, ""Why would such a positive man write such a negative book?"" Sure, this book tells an interesting story, but the story itself is the most depressing, and upsetting story I think I've ever read in my life. It's the kind of book you read, maybe cry, and will upset you to no end. It did for me. Actually, I couldn't even finish reading this book because it was just too painful to read. To anyone who was 'touched' by this book, bless you. All it did was make me sick to my stomach."
2,Disappointed,I have read almost everything that Dyer has written - even have a 10 cd pack of his lectures.I was pretty disappointed in this book. It was the first book that I read after graduating with my MBA and I was really excited. I ended up skimming it and reading the section titles...Try some of his other books instead.
4,"Dyer's a decent man, but ...","... I disagree with one of his main statements in this book:""Whatever solution you seek for whatever problem you may have is available to you in this moment.""Could I, for example, find a solution to my problem of attracting an international sex symbol, let's say in this instance someone like Racquel Welch, right now?I've used Mr. Dyer's recommendations and it has not happened yet, nor does it seem like it will.So, I have a problem with that particular statement of his."
3,OK,"Wayne Dyer-between his & Deepak's recordings, all they do is nag, nag, nag. Do this, don't do this, blah blah..."
3,solution,don't remember if I ever got it - maybe it was a present last year - sounds like something i would have liked
1,Dyer book a dud.,"Despite the basic premise of this book, there is a spiritual solution to every problem, this self-help book flops. Dyer has taken the Prayer of Saint Frances and turned it into a big money maker for him. Save your cash and just read the prayer! What I found particularly insulting about this book is Dyer's message to depressed people to ""just get over it"", as if depression were not a chemical imbalance or a serious medical condition. Dyer makes some good points in this books: instead of expecting to BE loved, GIVE love. But the endless repitition and the drivel about ""faster and slower vibrations of energy"" make this book a must miss."
5,There is a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem,I have purchased and listened to all of Wayne's Tape series and this is the best. He does not repeated himself which he sometimes does and every word is GREAT. It came at a time when I needed to hear exactly what he had to say about how our thoughts effect our energy levels and our physical body. I have already listened to all the tapes twice and on my weekend roadtrip will listen again! It is worth twice the price!
5,loved it,You will enjoy reading this book. I love reading this authors books. He always keeps your interest with unexpected things happening.
1,Avoid this product at all costs!,"This is the worst media I've ever tried to use. .... Well about 1 of every 5 cdrs actually works. Most of the time I just get bad media errors. I thought burning at 1x would help, but that doesn't work at all. Be sure to burn at 2x or higher. ....Pay a little more and go get some real media."
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.,"50 percent of the CDs don't work. The other CDs i have always work, but these usually dont work. It is a waste of money, spend a little more money and get better quality with the Khypermedia CDs."
5,Siver Marcasite Emerald Earrings.,"They are the right size but everybody notice them. They are beautiful is a great, great buy."
4,"A smart, savvy thriller that will keep you up at night until the last page has turned!","4.5 stars!A smart, savvy thriller that will keep you up at night until the last page has turned, Jeff Buick's African Ice is an adventurous tale of conspiracies, murder and the search for treasure. I read this novel while traveling from Alberta to Pennsylvania, and it kept me in its grip.The characters are interesting and multi-faceted, exploring their pasts and weaknesses. The foreshadowing was solid, the plot twists kept me on my toes and the ending had a quiet justice about it.If you're looking for a fast-paced adventure through the jungles in search of the motherlode of diamonds while the characters are being hunted by aborigines, hitmen and a deceitful employer, pick up African Ice. You won't be disappointed. I wasn't.~Cheryl Kaye TardifAuthor of Divine Intervention"
5,Great Read,This book was one of our book club reads and it was wonderful. We had the honour of having Jeff Buick attend our meeting and what an interesting person. I am now going to be purchasing his other books. Even my husband could not get his nose out of this book.
2,Wrong edition,"I hate it when amazon puts up a picture of the book (the right edition) that you need, and then when you are looking at the prices you find a good price for what you think is the right book but it's not. It shows the picture of the other edition book, but if you put a certain edition in a search that's what you expect to find. Instead, of buying the sixth edition I bought the fourth edition without knowing it, and then waited an eternity for it only to find that it's a LOT different than the right edition."
1,Not a very good CD-ROM drive.,"Wow,all the other complaints about this product are correct. I purchased this drive in early March and 3 weeks ago it stoped working and I hardly ever use the drive. So do your self a favor and spend the extra bucks to buy a good CD-Rom Drive."
4,Nice inexpensive CD-ROM drive,I bought this drive after having a good experience with the Cendyne 6x4x32 CD-Burner. It works without problems and it was easy to install. Delivery was prompt and on-time
3,"looks good, works ok","i bought this showerhead while remodeling our 1911 bungalow bathroom. we put in a clawfoot tub with shower surround so i thought the style of this showerhead would fit, which it does beautifully. however, the 3 shower settings are not impressive. the main shower spray is too wide leaving a huge gap in the middle where water doesn't spray. the vibrating/massaging setting is ok, good force but noisy and not very soothing. it gets three stars for being ok. i'll probably invest in a better one in the future..."
3,Glosses Over Quite a bit of History,"I am reviewing the Kindle Edition, so if there are changes from the print edition I apologize. I thought the book was a well written overview of the time period, but there were certain events, such as Benedict Arnold's plot that were completely skipped, while others, like much of the war to tell the truth, seemed to be glossed over quickly. I know that in any book covering such a long time period choices have to be made on what to discuss and what not to discuss, but this book seems to make some of the wrong choices. It seems to follow a general trend in history books over the past fifty years or so to de-emphasize the military events and to try to give us a snapshot of how groups who weren't directly fighting were involved with the war. While this is nice, I think the author went too far with the homefront snapshots during the war period. All in all a well written and informative book however."
4,"Thorough, A Very Complete Book","Middlekauf writes a very thorough book on the causes, fighting and management of our Revolutionary War. The exhaustive account of British debate about and guidance of the colonial issue in North America gives background not always found in other treatments of this subject. Although at times it tended toward an academic tone, ""The Glorious Cause"" is well researched, presented and argued. For the serious student of the War of Independence."
3,Kindle Edition is Older Edition,"Unfortunately, the Kindle version seems to be the first edition of the book. The book was recently updated with additional pages and it would have been better to offer the newer edition as a Kindle book."
3,A Glorious Undertaking,"This book is a vast resource. I had to read it for my American History class in college. While I appreciate its mastery, I found it dry and dull at times. I would not choose to read this for pleasure but perhaps a person with a great love of American history and a stronger attention span would value this book more than me."
5,The Glorious Cause,The revised edition of this excellent work is a treasure of information and insight into the most critical moment in American history. The perspective from both the British and American sides is invaluable both for understanding why the revolution was necessary as well as why it was inevitable.
2,mediocre,"There are many things I enjoyed about this book. However, I did not find the synthesis of material original or the narrative style compelling. He opens arguments which are quite debateable, such as implying that the Revolution's impetus was spurred by the energy of the Great Awakening, and then provides no further elaboration or evidence to support his assertion. In one paragraph he refers to European soldiers as scum and dregs and then bemoans the fate of the aristocratic officer corp who have to rely on beatings and hangings to keep the kidnapped soldiery in line. This makes Middlekauff sound incredibly dated, prejudiced and unsophisticated. For a military history read Christopher Ward instead."
2,Much better ones than this,"I found this book to be painfully slow and uninteresting. If you're looking for your first book on the rev war, please choose another. If you try this one, I doubt if you'll finish it and maybe decide the topic isn't for you. That would be too bad because there are so many good books on this fascinating time in history.The book could be improved with some good maps and photos, but the slow pace would still make it below average. If you'd like a good, scholarly overview of the Revolution, I suggest ""The Revolutionary War"" by Alden. It's an older book, but still excellent."
3,Hard read,"I am a history buff. I read all non-fiction history, anything and everything. But, this was the hardest book for me to read ever. I read about a fourth of it and gave up. Good luck."
3,"Complete history, well written","This is a good, well written history of the War of Independence primarily from the American veiwpoint. Siince there is much already written about this subject, there are fewer new insights than in some of the other books in this series. The best books in this Oxford series are ""What has God wrought"" and ""Freedom from Fear."""
3,Pretty good for a single volume history,"I read this book years ago for a class. The author is hardly a Cornelius Ryan, but he does an adequate job of describing the battles' blood and thunder. The beginning is a little slow, but detailed and important. He glazes over the importance of religion to the colonial sense of liberty. You will certainly know the key events of the American Revolution when you are finished."
4,A Bookend Account--best at start and finish,"Middlekauf's book starts off with a far more detailed account of the roots of the American Revolution than are offered by most books; I especially enjoyed the explanation of the Townsend Acts and Pitt's strange withdrawal from running the government. The middle part of the book was a bit unsatisfying and disjointed; he never, for example discusses Benedict Arnold's treason, and the surrender at Yorktown seemed almost anticlimatic. And those looking for a revisionist or even slightly ironic description of the main characters of the tale are going to be disappointed. Middlekauf gets back on form with the tale of how the Constitution came into being; he seems most comfortable dealing with drawing-room politics. All in all, not bad, but not the classic that others of the series have become."
3,Only fair for the Oxford series,"Glorious Cause was my introduction to the Oxford History series.While I had purchased others, this was the first of the series I read.I was somewhat disappointed because I expected much more.While I found the passages on key battles and the Revolutionary War in the South excellent, I felt coverage on other key events on the period lacking.Volumes of books on the Declaration of Independence,Franklin,Adams,etc have been written but I felt were barely covered here.Especially frustrating - Middlekaupf covered the courageousnees, ability and leadership of Benedict Arnold yet only mentioned his treachery of Washington and the colonists in a time reference to another event.Glorious cause was a fair read with much overview information with very little insight.I do look forward to the other books of the Oxford series."
5,Great Read for American History fans,"Great book. I'm working on the next one in the series now. You have to be a fan of American History to read it, but if you are it will be an enjoyable read for you."
2,Dissappointing,"This was a weak effort, esp. considering that the book is part of the Oxford History of the US. It offers no new insights, has very little arguement in it, and as such, there are far better single-volume works out there to be read. The book starts out very well in describing life in the 18th century on the eve of the war; it quickly goes down hill from there. Middlekauf does not seem to understand the British Army of the time either, as he frequently refers to British regiments by their Victorian-era names. I recommend John Alden's book instead."
3,"works fine, but uncomfortable","I've had this headset for about a year now; I use it with a Razr. It's a fine headset from a technical perspective: the sound is fine, it's easy to pair and use, etc. I haven't run into any problems using it in a car, or out of doors.However, it's really not very comfortable: the hook that goes over the ear is just a bit too stiff and edgy, I wouldn't want to wear it for a long call (more than 15-20min say).For comfort and performance, consider the Plantronics Voyager 510 (around $50 at Amazon); I've had one of those (now used by my son), and it is excellent. If you're into new gadgets, check out the Jawbone sets -- I haven't used one, but a colleague swears by the one he's been using for a couple of months."
1,disappointed on the sound quality,"That item has disappointed me at the sound quailty. Too much noise and unclear sound. After trying 1 week, I never use it again."
4,Good sounding BT.,I broke my other BT and was looking for a cheaper yet good alternative. I read some tech reviews and would agree that the call quality is pretty good. I haven't experienced any static or echos like some others have mentioned. My only big complaint is the buttons are hard to access. The volume buttons ar on the top and bottom like my old unit but these one are set in some. That makes it hard for pressing them if you have larger sized fingers (like myself simply being a guy). The other button is the call/function button that is the back panel you see in the photos. It is difficult because it is towards the back instead of the center(like it should be)resulting in the earpiece tilting off of your ear when having to push it. It also is a firm button which I doubt loosens up after more use. I'm not going to complain anymore though because for the price it's a reasonable BT.
3,"works OK, price good, there are better choices","Got the H3 two months ago, paid $9 more than today's price. It's a decent unit, but there are some drawbacks. The earhook doesn't make for a secure fit to your ear, but that's an issue for most BT headsets. Sometimes my H3 won't boot on the first key press after a recharge or sitting in a warm car for a few hours. Occasionally there's an echo on dialed calls, and the call key requires a firm push; if you aren't careful powering the unit off you might inadvertently redial the last number instead."
1,Had a horrible echo.,"Well, I ordered this headset because it matched my black RAZR. I read all the reviews and ignored all the complaints of echos. Now my wife will not even talk to me if I use it. The echo is horrible! I called several other people and go the same complaint. I am returning it after using it for 2 hours. I would not recommend this one."
3,Good but not great.,"Purchased the H3 to match up with my V3 Razr, which it does very well.The H3 connects easily and quickly when turned on. It is very comfortable and looks quite stylish.Two problems: 1) the max volume level is too low. This makes it difficult to use outdoors or in a car if wind and extraneous noise are present. 2) the volume controls are tiny and dificult to use. I leave mine set on the maximum and use the V3 volume control if necesary (rarely) to lower the level.I like the H3 and intend to keep it for indoor use. When outside or driving I use the Cardo scala 500 which has great volume capability and wind noise protection.The scala 500 is slightly less comfortable but overall, performs far better."
3,lots of feedback.,"this headset is light weight & fits well on the ear. It was easy to pair with the phone, but the sound quality was awfull. I went back the Moto H730!"
2,Not Happy,It works ok but volume is really low. You can barely hear the caller voice unless you go to a very quiet place.
2,Had to return it...,"Tried pairing it with a Treo 650 and Red Razr. Although pairing worked fine, the other party heard an annoying buzz on both phones - where as I could hear them clearly. Returned it to Amazon for a full refund...I gave it two stars because, the headset seemed to work on my end.."
1,Please don't even think about it,The on/off button hard to manage and not responsive. Very Bad sound quality and loud echo that make people on the other end don't want to talk to me. Totally useless.
4,best currently available headset,"I have a Nokia 6230 and purchased this headset from Compusa recently. Used to have a Nokia HDW-3 but the battery died and unable to find a cheap replacement battery.Pros:The unit is solidly made and easy to setup. The mute function work well, the volume is good (no DSP) and sound quality matches my old Nokia. Unlike a lot of loop headsets, this doesn't seem like it'll break/fall off as I tend to put it in my pocket when unused.Pairs fine with my Mac and you can turn off the blue light if needed. Charger is a small flip-prong type and reasonable at 2 hours to charge. Battery talk time is good although it's unclear what type of battery it has internally. The audio cues are fairly logical.Cons:Not the most comfortable headset I've tried. Prefer the in-ear like the Sony HBH-IV835 but I decided to keep this one instead as DSP might suck."
2,One big issue for me,"I like it, but the call button requires a hard push. After a few times, it hurts my ear. Sound quality is OK. I returned it for a Moto HS500 which is a hair lighter and the call button requires a much lighter touch. So far I like it better.So my vote is avoid H3, go HS500"
3,"Great Looks, Bad Echo.","I currently have a Samsung A900 with Sprint. I bought this headset about 2 weeks ago and I've had nothing but problems. First, It tends to disconnect from my phone after 5 minutes of me not using it. Second, everytime I talk to someone on it, they say that they hear an echo of themselves when they speak. I don't hear it though, just the other caller. Third, at my job, we have a wireless camera system set-up, the headset fades in and out when ever I get near a camera. I really love the battery life and looks of the headset but I can't deal with all those problems. I going back to my Motorola HS820 headset."
4,Good Sexy average headset,"Strengths: >> Work Perfect with my Motorola Razr V3. >> Slim, Sleek, Sexy >> Great Speaker and Mic.Weaknesses: >> Didn't connect with my laptop >> Not a lot of features. >> ON - OFF switch is kind weird >> Volume buttom doesn't work wellSummary: (Edited March 29th by ahsan_khurshid) I just received the headset and work perfectly with cell but they mentioned it works with PC as well, but due to some reason I couldn't make it connect with my laptop. I don know; I was assuming It will work. May be I am doing some thing wrong.Volume button doesn't turn up or down normally even after we keep it pressed. Some time it works some time doesn't. I don know may be there is some technique to do it perfectly. I mean! When we are in conversation we want to increase or decrees volume with out taking off the headset. Anyway so far this is kind of -ve point for the headset.Anyway, over all this is a great cool Bluetooth gadget. Have one - recomended :)"
2,Mediocre at best,"I got this headset when I got my RAZR phone, and loved the fact that I could use the same charger for the phone and the headset, but that's about the best feature it has. It did pair fine with my phone, and it seems to last a long time on one charge. The interface is OK, but I still haven't gotten used to switching calls when I would already be on it and get a second call. I hung up on people often trying to do this.The worst features are seemingly the most important. This thing fits horribly on my ear, and had a tendency to fall off. The volume was so low that even at it's loudest I often had to press it to my ear to hear (hands-free, huh). The worst was the static that either I would hear or the person I was talking to would hear. Nothing seemed to improve it.I just lost this earpiece, and I think it may have been a blessing in disguise. I'll look for something a little better this time."
2,Motorola Bluetooth H3,"Fair headset. Size, weight, comfort and battery life is good.The incomming sound quality is very good, problems start with outgoing sound. People tell me I sound like I'm in a tube with echos. Volumn control hard to adjust, talking outside can at times be only fair and the directions with the units beeping is not easy to remember."
3,Do you hear an echoe??????,"Style is nice. It does mimic my RAZV, but it feels like it is going to fall off my ear. I'm not sure if it is because of the size of my ears or what. Connection was very easy and the buttons are easy to use. The person you are talking to comes in loud and clear, loud and clear, loud and clear.... Oh, that must be that darn ECHOE problem. I hear no echoe, but everyone I talked to complained of a poor connection or echoe. This seemed to be a problem for both other cell phones and land lines."
3,Decent water filter,"It is an expensive way to have good tasting water, but probably worth it. I wish GE would reduce the price on these, haven't tried the aftermarket brands yet. Usually end up trying to stretch it another year.."
3,WF,"It's a water filter... and the fridge asks for one periodically. I don't have equipment to count water particles nor pH instrumentation; therefore, I'll take their word for it that it functions properly."
5,Works!,"Our new GE French Door Ref water and ice dispenser started acting up from a slow water drips to a complete stop. Thinking it might have been the filter installed at the back of the unit, I replaced it, still had the problem. I was told and read some blogs the filter in the back may be the problem so I removed it. Didn't wanna buy this filter because it is expensive. Shopped online and found a reasonable price here at Amazon, so I placed the order. My wife also placed a repair call from GE and they showed up the day the filter arrived. I didn't open the package but the repair guy confirmed that it was the inside filter. I opened the package and he installed it. Voila! I felt bad the tech had to show up but I ruled out this filter for we only had the Ref for a couple of months. I guess our water line has a lot of contaminants since we just had a renovation. I hope this filter will last longer than the original. If not, I will install back the back filter and install the bypass on my fridge."
5,Seamless Replacement,"After six months with our new refrigerator it as time to replace the water filter, you could taste a difference, but that filter had lasted longer than I anticipated. I looked at a few non-GE branded filters but the reviews mentioned poorly fitting filters, and I wasn't willing to risk it. Once I got this filter out of the box, I had it replaced in under a minute. The of the water is now back to being pure, well worth the extra money.As a side note, read the instructions. You want it fill it with water before you attach it otherwise the line gets air in it."
3,"Product Fine, Order Incomplete","Product quality is fine, but order was incomplete, and have been unable to get response from merchant. Today filed dispute of payment with PayPal."
5,Exact same GE filter,Received the filter quickly. It was the exact same filter sold by GE. Works great and installed in seconds.
5,Works well.,This filter fit perfect and there was no problem with installation. It works as described. I will purchase others in the future.
5,General Electric Water Filters,These water filters are really good! They clean and purify your water and save you money on not having to buy bottled water. They work and fit perfectly on my General Electric Refrigerator. The cheaper filters dont clean up the impurities in the water and they require an adapter o ring to prevent leakage too. Dont waste your money on the cheap filters by the General Electric Filters they are the best!
2,1 Defective Water Filter,I ordered a pack of 3 water filters in January and one of them was defective. I had to throw it away after only 2 weeks. I am very disappointed with the seller since these are pretty expensive.
4,"Filter great, but confused why per unit cost goes UP with multiple packs","These filters work great in my GE monogram refrigerator, but the per unit price actually increases when you buy them as a pack (at least at the time of this review)."
5,Identical to the original,This water filter is identical to the original and works well for ge refrigerators for which it is designed
5,Very pleased and will buy again.,The best price for three filters to the door. Arrived fast and filters looked great. Will buy here again.
5,Filter works great.,"The filters fit and worked as advertised. My first order was a third party product that looked like it fit in our GE fridge, however, every time I tested a glass of water the pressure would pop the filter off the fitting. For some items, third party products just don't work. These filters work great. Buying a 3 pack will mean that we will replace the filter in a timely manner. We always write the date of the filter replacement on the filter so you see it in the fridge and don't forget to change it."
4,Good,"Good price, respond on my expectation, easy to get it, easy to use, I recommend is a good product. Thanks"
3,Too expensive,The product is not one I can measure. It makes the warning light go out. But I view this as a low value product for what it is.The price should be half what it is.
2,Expensive water filter,"This filter didn't last six weeks. With the filter price, I can't afford to own this refrigerator. I am trying to come up with a different exterior filter. My old refrigerator had a filter that would last 6 to 9 months. This one only lasts 4 to 7 WEEKS. Too expensive. I will not buy another GE refrigerator either."
2,GW refigerator water filter,"The product does not last long (1 yr tops) and costs way more than it is worth. I took one apart and all it is is fused carbon. This item should cost no more than $20 and probably costs ~$5 to manufacture. Howwver, without it, your drinking water access through the door on your refrigerator will slow after a year and a half."
1,defective item caused me to be charged for a service visit,"The filter sent to me was defective. I ordered it because water was not flowing from the dispenser. After installing the new filter, water still was not being dispensed and I assumed there must be a problem with the refrigerator. The GE serviceman installed a new filter, which solved the problem, and he said this one was defective. The service visit cost $110, so even after the nuisance of returning the defective filter for a refund I will still be out of pocket for $77.54. I will not order filters here again."
2,Water flow reduced significantly within 2 months of putting the new filter,"After we put this new filter, water flow reduced significantly just within 2 months. We will have to replace the filter again."
2,Short life,"The original filter lasted about a year. The replacement MWF filters last about 1 1/2 to 2 months. At the ridiculous price, I'm not sure it's worth it. Others I know, have ditched the frig filter and installed a larger in-line filter."
5,Clean water,"Easy to install, clean water and ice, ice is much less cloudy and has a better taste with this filter."
4,Seems to work!,"this is our 3rd filter and they appear to work great. No leaks, no funny taste. No complaints. Works good."
4,great price,MUCH cheaper then store price.. came fast and is easy to install. will use same system in future. thumbs up
5,It's exactly what is required,This is exactly what my refrigerator required. Too bad it is hard to find in stores. I would buy again.
3,NOT the same as GWF: No Adapter,"Beware: this is not a perfect replacement for the GWF, as the GWF comes with the adapater to fit certain models (such as my fridge). If you get this, you will have to buy the adapter separately which will up your cost."
1,MWF Filters,"This was the second time I've ordered the MWF filter (different supplier) from Amazon. Amazon advertises the MWF filter in the blue box, which is what I need. But they ship a MWFINT in a green box. This filter is for International use only, not recommended for use in the United States by GE! I'll have to take my business elsewhere. Wish Amazon would ship what they advertise!"
4,Good product!,"Had no problem with it. Works great. The shipping went great, we received it in a couple of days. I never read the indications, took it out of the box and installed it right away!"
4,Good price,This was much cheaper to buy this online vs the store. It is the same GE product. Good quality. It works well.
5,Just like it is described,"Nothing more, nothing less. It is a genuine GE wafter filter. It was delivered as exactly as described but only the best price."
3,OK to Good,Manufacturer item and not a generic. Always worked well until refrigerator died. Design was somewhat difficult for me to replace filter after removing used one.
4,Just great,It was a perfect sale. The price was right for a brand new filter out of the box. You couldn't go wrong.
5,Nice quality refrigerator water filter,I've been using this filter to accommodate my refrigerator. Its easy to install and I've never encountered with any problems. Amazon has the lowest price available. Highly recommended.
4,Water filter,Package arrived safe and without damage. It worked perfect without any problems. I would definitely recommend this site. No problems with this filters so far.
5,GE Water Filter,Great price and shipping on a filter needed for my refrigerator. Can't say a whole lot on this product except that it's needed for my refrigerator so my water will work :-). Thanks Amazon........
5,GE MWF Refrigerator Water Filter,This is the best price available for this product. I shopped numerous sites and this was the cheapest. Fast delivery.
5,water filter for ge refrigerator,the product came sooner than was expected and it was packaged the same way as I seen it in sears and home depot . the big difference was the price 58 percent less than at both those stores .the skinny same great product for more than half the price what a bargain .
5,FAST AND PROMPT,FILTER WAS RECEIVED PROMPTLY AND IN NEW CONDITION AS PROMISED. VERY GOOD COMPANY TO BUY FILTERS FROM. WILL RECOMMEND TO OTHER PEOPLE.
5,Good tasteing water,The filter was very easy to install. The water tastes refreshing and good. The water flows very easy out of the faucet.
5,GE Water Filter replacement,I recently had to replace my GE refrigerator water filter. The unit I purchased was about 20% cheaper than I could find in the store. The delivery went well and overall I am very satisfied with the experience.
4,Frig Filter,"First GE Fig with a water filter. Following directions to replace every 6 months. Can't tell a lot of difference since St Louis water is among the best in the country, but water does taste good from the fridge, since in the old fridge it sat in the tubes for awhile and had some odor. Amazon made it easy to purchase the right thing. Increasingly local stores even in our big city don't allways carry everything."
4,Does the Job,Needed a replacement and found this. Different number but it still fit my model refrigerator and was easy to take the old one out and twist this one in. Also smaller. Wonder why?
4,Why not subscribe and save?,"Bought this to put in my fridge, and it was easy to install and works great. No problems there, however, since this is an item that you should change every six months, I think it would be helpful if this could be a Subscribe and Save item. I'd sign up so I wouldn't have to write the date on it and enter it into my calendar. First world problems, yes, but it would be helpful."
4,GE Refrigerator Water Filter,"Water filter is a GE part as advertised and seems to work well. Transaction was a fast and easy one. Just wished it were a little cheaper. All in all, fairly pleased with the item."
5,Beats the store price,"These are genuine GE Smartwater filter replacements. To get in 20 words, I'll just say that the purification beats a Brita filter which I use for everyday use, and of course, great tasting water."
5,Nice!,It was nice to be able to order these filters at a decent and very fair price. So nice and easy.
4,Almost no complaint,"It's a standard unit that fits all GE refrigerators. Only complaint I have is that it is expensive for something that they recommend you to replace every 6 months. GE also has a program where you can recycle the used unit by sending it to them, but you have to pay for the postage yourself. Personally that sounds ridiculous. From what I can tell the inside is a simple block (cylindrical) of carbon, a very simple and common type of water filter. So unless you live in a place that has no treated municipal water, it's really not necessary to replace the filter every 6 months."
4,Works great.,"This water filter works great, but the price is disgusting. Wouldn't use the GE brand again, because the aftermarket one works just as good."
5,Best Price,"I tried saving money by buying filters by other manufacturers. Although they were a lot cheaper they did not perform as well as this OEM filter (could not reset the filter warning light, filter particles in the water, dripping water spigot, etc.). This filter also removes more kinds of contaminants than the cheaper replacement filters."
3,GE MWF Refrigerator water filter,It works great and the water quality and taste are great. The price was somewhat high though for what I got.
5,Great Sevice! Great Price!,Service was great and price could not be beat. I recommend this company for sure!
5,Refrigeragtor water filters,"The filters arrived, brand new and what I especially liked was the cost. If I had bought these at the store they would have cost me $20.00 more. Thank you."
4,good value ge smart water filter,It showed up within a few days. No problem with the purchase.Works flawlessly since original part# replacement. I change them every 9 months - works for me. Decent price - saved trip to store or mall. Well packaged. I will keep buying them.
5,Water filter arrived promptly,"This filter was not my most exciting purchase, but the price was good and it arrived very quickly. The transaction could not have gone better!"
5,Identical to the original filter,"Good price compared to the $[...] plus shipping that GE wants. Wanted a filter that would also remove flouride, this one doesn't, but removes a bunch of other contaminants."
4,fridge filter,The filter was easy to install with good directions and pictures to aid with the install.The fit was perfect I would recommend this again.
4,"Fixed my ""slow flow"" problem...","I hesitated to replace the filter on my new GE Profile refrigerator when the indicator light came on (life-long procrastinator) until the water flowed to a dribble and the ice cubes were few and far between. I ordered the single 1-pack product just to make sure this would fix my problem. I received the product in just a few days, followed the directions, and had my ""slow flow"" problems resolved immediately. The installation took about two minutes and now my 'fridge is as good as new. I am going to order a few more to have on hand before the sales tax goes in force in Texas."
4,Filters fast is wonderful to deal with,"I had to get a new filter because the light went on in my ge profile, so i found Filters Fast here on amazon. They shipped very quickly, even faster than expected. Nicely packaged, no problems whatsoever. I am glad i found them because now i know to use them for all future filter orders because they are easy to deal with and prompt."
5,GE MWF Smartwater Filter,Works well at filtering the disgusting chemicals the city uses to 'clean' the water. I'm very pleased with this product.
4,Easy to replace.. works great,I needed to replace my old water filter and ordered this product. It was easy to replace and water tastes much better with the new one. Wish it had some indication when it's time to replace the old one.
5,arrived quickly and fit perfectly,The filter arrived quickly and fit perfectly. This was an old refrigerator with different numbers but this worked perfect.. so we were pleased.
4,Worked Great,Found it easily. Ordered it (at a good price). Received. Installed. It works great. What more do you need to know?
4,"No surprises, everything as expected",It arrived as expected and installed easy enough and does the job! Nothing to this one!
4,As expected. Works great,"Everything was as expected. Product came on time in new condition, and works fine."
3,"works, but not great","pro- water tastes great, ice dose not clump, great water flow so far.con- high cost, lasts 6 months, doesn't filter everything.my tap water is bad 680tds, with this filter i get 560tds. i know it dose not say anything about the safety of my water, but i expected way better.(this tester was confirmed with another professional tester that got same #s)"
2,Does MWF need adapter?,We have been using the MWF filter since we purchased the frig. Now I am reading about adapters. I am confused. Do I need to purchase an adapter for this filter? Has GE changed the configuration of the MWF filter?
5,"GE SmartWater MWF Refrigerator Water Filter, 3-Pack",What I liked best about this product was the price. I received 3 filters for less than twice the norman retail price of 1. And these are the correct OEM filter for my refrigerator.
1,Returned,This is the first time I have ordered the GE filter. I have always used the Brita filter. I replaced my old Brita filter and just came home to a flooded refrigerator and kitchen. There was water leaking from the filter. I re-inserted it several times and each time water leaked out. Will return this filter and go back to the reliable Brita.
3,You need an adapter,Please check if you need an adapter for your filter when you buy this.It does not mention this on the product page.I had to order the adapter after receiving the filter.
4,GE Filter,"What can I say,it fits, works and does what it is built for. The only think I have against it is the price."
5,Out and In,"open the box, Fill the new one with water and screw it in, with really hard water lasts like 4 months and was 20 some bucks less than sears."
5,Works. Flows better than Brita,Works well. Filters water. Pretty much does what it says. We had a Brita filter in the fridge and this flows much better than the Brita did. Water tastes the same as the Brita. Seems to use less room in the fridge too.
4,Was it a good deal after all???,"I was very pleased to find a three pack of my needed filters... I like to be able to replace them as needed by having them on hand. But to my dismay, one seemed to be defective. So was it such a good deal after all? How do you go about sending ONE item out of three pack back??? especially when it has already filled with water??? So I tossed it and went on to the next filter - which is working perfectly."
4,Good filter,This is the exact filter I needed. When I received it and I installed it it went it very easy. The only difference is its much smaller than the original which is nice. Water tastes good and I'm happy.
5,Great deal!,This is the exact same filter that I used to have to make a trip to Sears to buy and it was always a pain! This item was shipped to me through super saver shipping (no cost) and I got it in 3 days! PLUS the filter was $10 cheaper then Sears! Saved time AND money - gotta love it!
4,Filtered water-it's a necessity at our house,We go through 3-4 of these a year at our house and we buy the same cartridge every time. It is what our fridge accepts so what other option is there?Great filtered water every time!
2,Clogged after 2weeks,"Got the filter, good price considering what it cost at local. However, second time I have bought this online one to find it completely quits ( no water) after 2weeks. Went to sears for a new filter ($42) ouch, but it does function perfectly. Don't know what's up with these filters from amazon but it IS NOT a deal to spend $32+$42 =$74 for a new filter TWICE. last time I am buying on line."
2,Did not work for long,"We ordered this filter as a direct replacement to the one the fridge came with. Everything was running fine until last week when water just quit coming out of the dispenser at all.If you do any research on my particular fridge you will find that the icemaker, which is making next to nothing of ice for the last 2 months or so (making ice real slow), and the water dispenser are a major issue. This is concerning the ice maker itself and the multi-control board that runs the dispenser.I rip the filter out today only to find that it is totally blocking all water from getting through. My water has not changed since the last filter nor is the water coming out now rough and ugly with the plug installed.Sad that this filter only lasted less than 5 months, their quality must be getting bad or I got a shabby one."
2,Leaky Filter,"The filter leaks so that we have to leave a receptical under it. It is a minor leak, and we believe it is coming from the connection point to the refrigerator. We tried lubricating the O-rings with vaseline, but that did not stop the leak."
3,Over priced and making me rethink my GE purchase,This filter works ok but it is way over priced that is why I only gave it 3 stars. Fortunately I only change it every year or two. GE may be making a high percentage of profit but this is a low cost item so they are losing a lot of customer loyalty to make only a few extra bucks. Not smart. GE used to be a bellwether company but now they are heavily in debt and poorly managed. That is why competitors like LG are eating their lunch. I will think seriously before making another investment in a GE appliance.
3,Fridge filter adequate,"This filter is the original correct part for our GE fridge. In terms of how good it is, I would say it is not as good as filters I get for my kitchen faucet. I can taste the difference. But, hey, there is not better choice that I know of that would improve on it."
1,Very very unhappy,It is not even a month and this filter acting like it has been in use for 6 months it takes for ever to fill a glass of water. I tried to look for a phone number to complain but didnt find any. And funny enough this is the second order of the same thing that this happens.I hope I can contact someone from GE or Amazon this is just not right.
4,No surprises,"This is the second GE MWF filter I've purchased from amazon. They are easy to install, and perform as expected."
4,Water Filter,Excellent filter have used for years.Good price beats GE's price. Easy to install. Would recommend it to anyone with the GE Refrigerator that uses it.
1,Didn't receive what is pictured & described,Ordered one MWF filter and received a MWFINT filter for international replacement only. I am looking into it to see if I can even use this filter. I gave one star because of the quick delivery of the item I didn't order. If the company handles this appropriately I will reconsider giving more stars and credit where it is due.
2,GE water filter,"After installing the GE MWF water filter in my refrigerator , I ran water through it on several occasions and tested the water with the water tester that came with my previously purchased ZERO water pitcher. The water that was supposedly now purified with the GE filter did not test well, and, in fact, tested the same as the ""unfiltered"" tap water straight from my faucet. I believe that purchasing and using the GE filter is an unneeded expense and a waste of money"
1,Wrong item received TWICE!,"I received the international type of water filter mistakenly, and I exchanged it through Amazon. The replacement went very smoothly, and I received it quickly. However, the second filter received was also the international type and the wrong item. In frustration I called Amazon, and they gave me a refund and a $10 credit on a future purchase. They told me not to buy this item again, and they would investigate what was happening. I would have given zero stars if I could. However, the seller did ship the items quickly."
1,GE MWF SmartWater Filter,"This is the first replacement GE SmartWater filter that I have purchased for our new GE 26 cu. ft. side by side. The water pressure at the water dispenser was getting pretty slow so I figured it was time to replace the filter. After receiving the new filter and replacing the original one, the water pressure was normal for about 3 weeks and then started to slow down a bit. It's at about 1/2 of normal pressure now. I think I might have received a faulty filter since the original one lasted over 11 months before slowing down, not sure."
3,Water improvement,Manufacturer indicated best to have filter for better tasting water. Feel more comfortable having filtered water nowadays..anything for better health.
5,GE SmartWater MWF Refrigerator Water Filter 4 pack,I thought this was a great deal instead of buying 4 individually. 1st one I have used is working great!
5,A must after 4 years :),"If your filter is a couple years old, I highly recommend replacing it with this one. I don't agree with replacing it as often as it is supposed to be. My fridge is 4 years old and I never replaced mine. I kept telling myself that I would replace it once the water taste funny or something. Well, my water was coming out real slow. Slow enough to think that it might be time to replace it. Now it comes out 2x faster! I think I will start replacing them every couple years now :)I'm kind of a cheap guy and I considered the other cheaper filters, but I thought I better not be cheap with something like this. It's up to you, go cheap or buy what's right. I believe this is the right filter for the job. I mean, come on. It's the OEM!!"
5,Satisfied customer,Works like it should. Price was great - below that of local building supply stores. Prompt delivery.
3,Works great BUT...,"they work great, this seller is quick, but I got a smaller substitute than the one I ordered and was not notifed ahead."
5,"Straightforward - works as expected, half the price of local stores",Pretty straightforward product - works exactly as advertised. Plug and play really. Best part is that these are available here for close to half the price of what they sell for at local stores. Great buy!
4,GE MWF regrif=gerator water filter,"Very easy to install and lasts a sufficient time. I will definitely get this item again, Amazon has never failed me yet. The item was easy to install and the price was much better than at my local store. Delivery I may add was free and very fast."
5,GE MWF refrigerator water filter,"Exactly the same product I needed and for a better price. And it arrived in less than a week from the moment I placed the order, much sooner than expected! Great service!"
4,Great filter!,"This filter is very easy to change and give a very clear and odorless water. However, in the first couple days, it causes some blanded taste in water. I wasted the first two gallons of water prior. I guess if you wasted more water that might be helpful to prevent the taste issues.;"
5,"Easy Install, Works Great","The filter is very easy to install, just line up the arrows and screw it in. Fill up a few glasses of water to flush the air out and you're done! The whole process takes less than 5 minutes. I've replaced this filter at least 10 times over the last 6 years and they have never leaked or caused any trouble."
5,Much cheaper than HOME DEPOT,save $$$ buy buying 2 at time here. No tax or shipping. Just watch price for multiples. You don't always save if you buy more than 2.
5,GE Water Filter,We have used other brands of filters in our refrigerator but GE's has the fastest water flow and lasts longer.
2,Most likely a refurbished or rebadge GE Smart Filter,"Typically, the GE SmartWater Filter last roughly 6 months in my house and I had good luck with this filter until NOW. Each of these filter lasted roughly 3 months or less. The water could barely flow after roughly 7 weeks.I have had good luck with ordering stuff from Amazon but had run into a couple of products that I ordered from Amazon recently that does not seem to work as good or deceptively shown (recieved product does not look like what was shown).This is SAD because I have been a good Amazon customer. These kind of incidents will for sure make me rethink of buying any thing through Amazon again."
5,a breeze,"Always a breeze to order and install this filter. It's never a problem with this filter or shippers. The used filters end up very heavy due to the material filtered out of my tap water and, in my opinion, tastes better than most bottled water."
4,Easy install,It's very easy to install this products. And it only took me very short amount of time to completed install. And good deal.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this!,"Not only does this filter NOT REMOVE ANYTHING, IT ADDS CRAP!!TDS meter readings on water from an OLD FILTER attached to the sink: 181 (Obviously, that filter is bad and we never use it).TDS meter readings on TAP water: 134!!TDS meter readings on the water FILTERED WITH THIS GE MWF FILTER: 149!!! Not a typo, that's 149!!It's WORSE WITH the filter!! WTF?? No wonder my cats won't even drink water filtered by this filter!Meter is an HM TDS-4 (sold here).I'm getting a refund, total waste of money."
1,Worthless,I got it in March but installed it today. Flow rate is a tiny trickle indicating a very used or defective filter. Will never buy this item from Amazon.
2,GE Filter MWF,"Price now $2 below 10 month ago pricing, STILL no recycle options, why NOT.Good price but No recycle options, that's not what you should expect from GE, where are the recycle options?, credit for returning old ones?....GE need to step up to this.Love to see GE reply to this post, not sure they will though, give us some options to recycle...!"
2,what's the point?,this is the same price ge charges. i've come to expect amazon to have better prices. why bother ordering here?
2,"Box was opened and did not appear ""new""",I expected an unopened item although the filters themselves were sealed otherwise I would have returned them. It was probaqbly a return
5,Good Filter,I like this filter.. It saved me lots of money. I stopped using the other pitchers because of expensive filters...
5,Exactly what we ordered,"The filters arrived fast and they were exactly what we ordered/expected. They work great, no problems. Best price I could find."
3,Didn't need- but guess it works,"We bought this filter because the refrigerator need filter light came on. After we purchased this replacement filter, we learned that because we have an RO unit, this filter is 'overkill' and not necessary. So we have since removed it (put the plug in). There is no taste difference. Didn't need it. DO YOU HAVE AN RO SYSTEM? IF SO- SAVE YOUR MONEY- YOU DON'T NEED THIS."
4,Refigerator Water Filters For About Half Price,"I have discovered that I can obtain GE Brand replacement water filters for my GE Refigerator, from Amazon, for about half the price that they would cost if bought from the GE Parts & Accessories website. I have adopted a personal new rule - whenever I need to purchase something check and see if it is available on Amazon."
5,GE walter filter,"The product is exactly the one our regrigerator needs, works great and does not give a weird taste to the water."
5,Nothing like Name Brand Parts,"I ordered a Water Sentinel brand first because it was about $5 cheaper than this, and it leaked and simply would not work.This GE fit right up like it should- I will only order a real GE filter from now on."
3,Water Filter,Not sure if these are real. My first round of order seemed to work better. The second round had water with some bad taste.
5,GE MWF refrigerator filter,The GE Smartwater MWF Refrigerator Water Filter fit perfect and works great. The price on Amazon was excellent.
5,Water filter for refrigerator,Easy to get the old filter off & install the new filter. Makes a big difference in the ice production.Price was great.
5,Does what it says it does,"The filters are a bit pricey, but they do what they're supposed to. I don't think it's intended to reduce minerals, as many other reviewers have complained. It's mainly for chlorine and some common pollutants. Water tastes decent, but don't expect it to taste like spring water. For $30 and six months of use, you get your money's worth."
1,GE refrigerator water filter non-functional,"Got this less than two months ago for at least $10 less than everybody else was selling it for. Just opened it today and tried it out and water dispenser wouldn't work at all. Replaced it with the old one and dispenser worked just fine. Can't return it since it's past 30 days now. If you purchase this product, I would advise using it right away to confirm it is good. Otherwise, you might just get a great price on a ""piece of crap."""
1,Doesn't filter anything!,"I have 2 GE refrigerators, both under 2 years old. I purchased 2 of these replacement filters...and an HM water meter, to see how good the the filters work. To my extreme surprise, the water filters remove nothing from the water, the contaminent levels are equal with the tap water in each of my two houses!!! I ran gallons of water through the filters and the readings never went down. So I called GE, customer service informed me there was a small chance I could have received 2 defective filters, and I should try to return them to Amazon. I tested the HM water meter on bottled water that is supposed to be very pure, and it was. Arrowhead water is at a ""marginally safe tap water"" level. My neighbor's reverse osmosis worked well. (I highly recommend everyone get a water meter...especially if you are putting any kind of trust in these GE filters!)."
2,The description for the item changed.,"I did receive one genuine water filter for my refrigerator and it worked fine. But what I ordered (and what it stated on my invoice and on my order confirmation) was a ""3-pack of ...""I tried to contact the vendor, no response.I tried to contact vendor through Amazon resolution web page, no response.I filled out an Amazon claim, no response.Amazon refunded my money.So although the filter I did get was fine, the vendor needs to work on their customer service. I am satisfied with what happened, but still it would have been more fair if they had just refunded me 66.6% of the money I paid, or had sent me two more filters and not refunded me anything...."
4,It's a filter,"I've bought ALOT of stuff at Amazon over the years, and it has never occured to me that I might not be getting anything other than brand new retail items, exactly the same as if I bought from a brick and mortar store. Getting this filter caused me to question that. It came in the GE retail box, but the box was open. The filter was shrink wrapped inside the box, but it did not look like it was shrink wrapped at the factory. The instructions said to remove the adapter if you didn't need it (which I didn't), but the filter didn't have an adapter. The instructions said to put one of the enclosed monthly stickers on the filter to remind you when to change it, but mine didn't come with any stickers. I'm hoping that it is not a return, but how would I know. The filter looks brand new.Regardless, it's a filter, it does what it's supposed to do, it's easy to remove the old filter and put in the new one, and Amazon has it a few dollars cheaper than Home Depot or Lowe's."
1,Refrigerator Filter,"What I ordered was an original GE Refrigerator filter. Description, model number and pictures indicated an original part that looked the same as the original filter.What I received was a WaterSentinel replacement filter. This was not an original GE part. Looked different than the GE filter. This is a false represemtation of the product."
5,Great product,"Recieved it 2 days early, easy install, screw the old one off, fill the new one with water and screw the new one in. Water pressure increased noticeably for the filtered water. Price was much cheaper on line"
1,Used/Refirbished/Lemon-of-a-Filter,"*Note: do NOT purchase from A-1 Appliance Parts*I installed this filter as a replacement to the original that came with our GE refrigerator. I noticed a distinct chemical/metallic/dirt taste in the water from the start, but didn't think anything of it. I decided to buy a three-pack of filters directly from GE. What a difference! And when I removed the filter I bought from A-1 Appliance Parts it had rusty liquid in it to boot! The original filter never had that! Lesson learned the hard way - there are just some things you don't buy from scumbags on Amazon. There is no doubt in my mind that something was wrong with that filter and the seller knew about it. It's sad that I had to spend another $96 on filters (3-pack) direct from GE, but at least the water & ice cubes coming from my refrigerator taste good again."
4,Replacement worked fine,"Product and packaging look like they are original replacement parts.I've bought other filters but these work as described and dont look like knockoffs as they are sealed in a few ways.Filters seem to work fine but I havent tested them scientifically.Though they are still cheaper here than my local store, I'm only giving 4 stars due to the high price."
5,Viking,Arrived ahead of time. This is the fourth time I have changed the filter. I also have a in-line water filter feeding the refig.
5,Works,"It's easy to install, it's cheap, and it works. What more is there to say? If this is less expensive somewhere else, buy it there. Otherwise buy it here :)."
5,GE refrigerator replacement,"Exact same manufacturer filter replacement. Easy to install on a GE Profile refrigerator - finished in less than 20 minutes. Longest time was for the phase where one has to push through 1.5 gallons of water through the new filter. Otherwise, it very fast."
2,refrigerator water filter,The filter fit perfectly. However I am concerned that it is a refurbished filter and not actually new. The instructions for inserting the filter did not match with the filter enclosed. The filter had a piece of foil on the top. The instructions said the plastic adapter on top needed to be removed before inserting in the Ge refrigerator. I just removed the foil and it fit fine. It also did not have the date sticker refer to in the instructions. I wrote the date on it in marker.
5,Easy to install,"From the 3 or 4 different type of filters I've had to deal with, this one was the easiest to install. No water spills!"
3,Filter,This filter sucked compared to the last one purchased. Same one just this one was low flow very quickly after using. As soon as I started using flow was like an old filter. Usually for weeks flow is fast.
5,Good discount,"We saved a few dollars by purchasing the water filter on Amazon opposed to going to Home Depot, which is what we've done in the past. The delivery was quick; will definitely order these again."
4,makes water taste great,"It's a filter, it fits in the refrigerator, it doesn't need to be changed for about 6 months, it makes the water taste great. The only gripe I have is that it is expensive and there doesn't seem to be many other products like it to drive down prices."
3,Items Works But Not What I Ordered,"Ordered MWF filter but received MWFINT (International Version), the packaging states ""For International Use Only"". After doing some research determined that this filter was the same as the MWF just packaged differently. The filter has been installed and is working just as well as the original. Two stars in this review were lost because these details should have been stated in the description instead of sending out this version of the filter that did not match what I ordered and having to waste time researching it."
4,smart choice,"The 2 pack is a smart choice as a money saver. Plus, you never know when that filter light is going to go on, so I like having the extra one in the house."
4,Shipping,I ordered GE water filter on Amazon this past June saved some money but the vendor for unknown reasons did not ship product till one week after order was placed. I would not purchase this product again on Amazon unless it has different vendor. I tried to E-mail Amazon with my concerns and never recieved reply.
5,Where's it Made?,Does the job and does it well. Filters so that the water has no after-taste. But I see nowhere on the packaging or item itself WHERE it is made and I know GE outsources most of the manufacturing of their products. And I think they're the only company who makes this filter. :(
5,Great price for an original GE replacement filter,"I ordered this filter from Amazon and it is the exact same filter that came with the refrigerator. I couldn't believe the price difference by purchasing the filter here versus directly from GE. As with any item on Amazon, the price goes up and down but I am more than happy with the price I paid."
5,water filter,"This product arrived as promised, in great condition and well under the retail price. Very pleased."
2,International Part received,The International version of this filter arrived in the box rather than what I ordered. Not only did they ship a MWFINT rather than a MWF but they also show a picture of the MWF (blue colored label) and then shipped a different product (green colored label). This should have been clearly stated in the Item Description.
4,Great Filter,"I bought other ""low cost"" filters and they're terrible compared to this. The only downside is that this has to be replaced often in NY due to the water here. Still, the water is a lot better with this than other filters."
2,Item not exactly what I ordered,"Like the last few reviews, I received a MWFINT filter instead of the listed MWF filter from the seller (Seneca River Trading). Box said installation instructions would be inside, though I didn't find any. (Not that it's hard to install, but I hoped the documentation would explain if the MWF could be replaced by MWFINT).I'm not a lawyer or anything, but I did find the following NSF page online, which appears to say the MWF can be replaced by the MWFINT:[...]Judging by the earlier responses, even if the seller's response was just a form letter, they should have included a note with the shipment. Hard to do when your shipment is merely slapping a mailing sticker on the actual product box! Disappointed in how this was handled, but assuming it all works OK, have to give an additional star for price and quick delivery.Come to think of it, this review should be about product, not about the shipper. Be sure to leave feedback about Seneca River Trading under seller feedback."
1,Filter clogged in two months time,"I have always replaced my water filters with GE MWF filters with no problems, this last one ordered clogged and became defective in two months. Really disappointed in it. Filters comes with a 30 day warranty from the manufacture, so I am out of luck!"
3,can't tell,"these type of filters were hard to tell if they are good or bad, since I did not send the water to lab for testing. I wished that they allow us to recycle these filters, it's such an environmental polluter once you have to replace them. Felt guilty to throw them away."
4,Works as designed,What can you say about - it works as designed. They are pricy but worth having for filtered water. They last 6 months to a year depending on use.
5,water filters,The price was significantly below the best price that I could find either online or in stores. Only place to buy this!
3,Product was a replacement,"This product was about the same price if you were to buy it at Home Depot or Lowe's once you including the shipping price, but I avoided the hassle of going to either one of those big chain stores where it takes you half an hour to find what you're looking for, and received the product within 2 days, great on-line shopping convenience. Product was easy to install."
4,"Yes, $20 more but I think it is worth it.","I bought the off-brand GE filter to replace the filter that came with my refrigerator and was happy not paying nearly double. The difference though, I believe, is the taste. There is a slight taste to the water using the Water Sentinel brand and it got increasingly noticeable as the filter aged. I could be wrong so I bought the GE brand again so I could pay more attention, but overall, I don't think I'm entirely wrong. It is a shame these cost so much, but I happen to like filtered water."
3,Good price compared to other locations,Brand new filter still in package. Filter is not as good as my last refridgerator's. Still taste chlorine and plastic taste. Not happy with GE.
4,Just what I needed,"I have a GE refridgerator that is a little over 7 years old and I needed a new filter for the water dispenser. It was a little difficult to tell if this one would work, however it is exactly like the one I had. I got it fast and it was well packaged so it arrived with no damage. Thank you. I will be ordering more. :)"
5,Good bargain.,"Definitely a savings over what I was paying at Home Depot, buying one-at-a-time. The only drawback is you are spending a little more up front and keeping them in ""inventory"" ..."
5,Fits perfectly,Exact replacement water filter for my GE refrigerator at a much lower cost then purchasing at the local stores. Highly recommended.
4,Good filter. Better price than elsewhere.,Every six months (ish) I need to buy this filter for my GE refrigerator. I usually buy it a Home Depot where I bought the fridge. But they are located a half hour away and I seem to forget to buy the replacement when I'm in town. This was $11 lower in price and shipped with Amazon's Prime.The filter is simple and effective. I bought the fridge partly for this filter system and continue to love it.
3,Easy to install but doesn't seem to be recyclable,"I hated to throw this out...you'd think it would be recyclable? Easy to install, water tastes just fine. word word"
4,Works good,"My only problem was the price but what isn't overpriced now a days,other wise I think it does what it supposed to do.It did make the water taste a little better and it came out a lot faster."
5,I love filtered water,Perfect fit in my GE stainless french door fridge and saved me a bit of money versus purchasing them elsewhere.
1,Water stopped working when I installed it,When I installed this filter my water in the door stopped working at all. Getting a replacement was no help.
5,GE water filter,The filter fits my refrigerator and works great. Easy to install and the product came quickly. I am Very happy!!
5,clean water,Thanks for the water filter for my refrigerator. It is working great and we received it in just two days. It was very easy to install and just had to drain a gallon and a half from the water despenser before we started to use it. I will use this manufacture again and going through amazon is so easy.
3,GE MSF Filter,"Part was available at a significantly discounted price. Delivery was as promised. Removal of old filter and installation of new was accomplished in less than 1 minute. In fact, it took longer to open the box than to swap the filters."
4,"Original equipment, convenient ordering",It was great to find these in a convenient online store. Delivery was fast and they work as expected.
5,MWF Replacement Water Filter,It looks and works like the original. The only difference is the lower price.
4,filter,"Its a filter, an expensive filter. Does the job. I hope. Buying it from G.E was $40.. Thank goodness for Amazon."
4,"Good Price but could be even more ""green""","Item arrived as advertised, shrink wrapped, and at a great price. I was only disappointed that the product didn't come with a ""change by"" sticker to put on the filter as the instructions said should have been with it; so I used a sharpie. Additionally, I found out, after the fact, that if you buy the product from the GE website (and only through them, apparently) they send you an envelope to put your old filter in, which you send back to GE so that it can be recycled. However, the filters do cost a bit more through the GE website."
5,GE refrigerator water filters,"The filters came quickly and fit the refrigerator perfectly. Genuine GE product, not after market. I'm happy with the purchase."
4,GE Smart Water filters for GE Refrigerators,GE Smart Water FIlters for GE Refrigerators. Much more economical to order this 3 pack from Amazon that to buy them one at a time from Home Depot type stores.Amazon had best price that day but shop around on line.
5,BEST WATER FILTER ON THE MARKET,These are the best water filters I have ever used. Water tastes pure and refreshing every time. These filters actually last longer than 6 months. I wouldn't use anything else.
4,GE Refridge Ice & Water filter,"I WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH MY FILTER PURCHASE From Amazon.com It was much less expensive than buying from GE or other purveyors. The order process was quick and easy, and I had my new filters in no time at all. I am very satisfied."
5,Thanks Amazon,"Recently, I bought a filter because I was picking up other things at Home Depot. I forgot what I last paid on Amazon and how long ago it was. Well! I paid $12 more.Thanks Amazon for the savings!Our city water supply has a good well but during a maintenance cycle or for whatever cause, it's switched over to a well that's not so good. Tap water from this well tastes and smells a lot less than good.Thankfully, this filter keeps the water quality at the refrigerator dispenser from changing during the maintenance cycle.I considered the 3 pack - saving another $1.53 each but since I only need to change the filters once a year (our water doesn't plug the filters up and still tastes good 6 and 12 months later). I'll buy an extra filter this year for the savings but I don't need more. I will not buy anywhere else again unless Amazon stops keeping these filters in stock."
4,"Works well, easy to install","It's difficult to review a product like this because there's little to base its quality on. I can only comment on the perceived quality, ease of installation, and overall taste of the water. Basically, it's a good product, the installation was a snap if the directions are followed properly, the water seems clean and tastes fine. The only reason for 4 starts instead of 5, is that the water has a bit of an after-taste if it's left in a glass and warms to room temperature. My wife says she didn't notice it though, so maybe it's just me. It's not enough to be concerned about but it is slightly noticeable (it's probably the same with all carbon filters like Brita, et al.) Other than that, the water tastes fine when it's cold and fresh from the tap."
1,Filter failed in 1 week,This filter failed in 1 week.. not sure if the filter is defective or water had too much dirt to filter out.
3,Good overview for starting search marketing. Needs meat.,"PROS:- Covers the broad spectrum of topics related tto search marketing. Includes terms, vendors, technology, fraud issues, metrics, and glossary. Mostly focused on paid search strategy, terms and tactics.- Brings you up to the level of strategy and down to the level of tactical implementation of pay for performance tactics.- If I were starting a position in Search enginge marketing, this would be the book to read. It's like sitting down with an expert teaching me the job of search engine marketing. Great for newbies or executives to get a comprehensive overview.- If you need to ""speak the language"" of search engine marketing and be conversant in strategies and tactics, this is the book for you.CONS- Would love to see more `insider' tips and case studies. For that, go to MarketingSherpa.com.- Could be organized better. Didn't flow for me.- Good overview, but not a lot of information about natural search engine optimization.- Overpriced at $37"
4,concise about branding and bidding for search terms,"This book might be compared to a recent one by Moran and Hunt, ""Search Engine Marketing"". Colborn's text is a little more concise. He aims it at a marketing reader, whereas the other book was also directed to someone who knew HTML. Colborn skips any discussion of how to write actual HTML pages in a way suited for search engines to rank well. Instead, he talks more on branding your site and isolating useful words and phrases associated with it, that users might ask a search engine about.There is also a quick runthrough of bidding strategies on various search engines. Well, realistically, only Google and Yahoo matter. The bidding is for those words and phrases that you defined in your branding."
4,Civilization in Trouble,"I like Mr. Lester R. Brown! I liked this well written book which was very interesting. He's a good writer. You don't have to struggle to get to the end of this book. I read books like these because I am concerning about what type of world my children will live in in 2035-2050, long, long, after I am gone. Some of the Author's warm and fuzzy ideas I don't agree with. When I was born, there were only 150 million Americans and 2.5 billion people on the earth. Now there are 300 million Americans and 6.5 billion people on the earth. Life will not be warm and fuzzy when there are 400 million Americans and 9 billion people on the earth. I think the outcome will be war and sickness. This book is a very, very good read! Regards, Keith Renick, Peachtree City, Ga."
5,A Must Read,"Plan B 2.0 is more than an update of Plan B, published two years ago. It updates the threats that overshadow our planet, cites progress where restoration of the earth is already taking place in parts of the world, and sets forth a specific plan to(1) restructure the global economy to sustain civilization;(2) eradicate poverty, stabilize population and restore hope to enlist participation of developing countries;(3) launch a systematic effort to restore natural systems.An earth budget of $161 billion per year woud save civilization, an unprecedented investment for an unprecedented challenge. Nothing short of human well-being for all time is at stake. Our real enemy is time!"
4,"Concise, Conservative Theology","This is the premier handbook for Southern Baptist Theological views. In this book, Boyce conveys the Biblical support for the modern conservative movement in Southern Baptist life. It offers several Biblical references to support any theory that is offered. It is an excellent resouce for Bible students."
4,"ONE OF ABC'S BETTER ""MOVIE OF THE WEEK"" ENTRIES","I remember the ABC TUESDAY (and WEDNESDAY) MOVIE OF THE WEEK very fondly. This 1973 entry was one of the better efforts, along with THE ROOKIES (1972), MAYBE I'LL COME HOME IN THE SPRING (1971) and of course, BRIAN'S SONG (1972). You have good performances across the board, with Richard Roundtree in his prime (post SHAFT) and standard TV vets as Vince Edwards, Andrew Duggan, Richard Jaeckel and Val Avery. FIREHOUSE on DVD. Now bring on THE ROOKIES."
2,Good concept but very incoherent,The thoughts are there but it's so poorly written that one might have to re-read many parts to fully understand.
1,A massive disappointment,"Then again, this is Eric Foner and bait and switching should be expected. If you expect a study on how history changes and reinvents us, something that would have been useful in understanding the shared collective memory of -- let's say -- September 11, you'd best look elsewhere. Who Owns History is simply a collection of essays that promote Foner's leftist politics."
4,"Good Question, Good Book","This is an insightful and thought-provoking collection of essays on the study of history by the eminent American historian, Eric Foner. Foner's best known works focus on the Reconstruction period after the Civil War, and that is a major focus for this book. In addition, Foner writes about how his own life shaped his interest in history, and his attitudes towards it. The key message of the book is that history is necessarily interpretive, and that interpretation of the past is shaped by current political realities. This is vividly demonstrated when one compares (as Foner does) the Ken Burns version of the Civil War (a battle between brothers that led to reconciliation) to Foner's own interpretation (a struggle over slavery that still has not be completely resolved). 'Who owns history?' is an important subtext in current American political debate, and ""Who Owns History?"" is a great help in thinking about the problem."
3,Nothing special,"The book started out somewhat interesting but I got bored later. The title raises a good question, but not sure it was really addressed. Just lots of previously written speeches."
3,NTI CD-MAKER 2000,This program works great with a wide vatiety of cd writers as long as you use win98 or win98 se. I have had limited success with win me if you upgrade win98. problems are encountered when win me is started as a clean load and nti cd-maker is loaded. The program works up to the point of writing to the disk and freezes or reports an error that the cd-rw is not recognized. The labeling advertizes compatable with win me. Removing nti cd-maker and loading roxio cd-creator 5.0 works great under a clean load.
5,Great Dodge Caravan 1996 Part,Bearing is the correct and quality item. Fitted perfectly my Dodge 1996 Grand Caravan.Packaging was superb and delivery time was fast.Price is okay and I will order another one for the right side soon.
4,Good read.,"For a history book, it's not bad. Very well written and illustrates points pretty well. Very logically organized also."
2,bad condition,"condition is very bad, all pages dirty, many folded, cover scratched, and pages in the back of the book had holes. too expensive for $15, i would only sell it for half of that price."
5,Kafkaesque study of a day in the life of a security guard,"Patrick Suskind's The Pigeon is a melancholy tale of oneman's struggle to cope with a small change in his beloveddaily routine - the appearance of a pigeon (and itsaccompanying foulness) in the hallway of his apartmentbuilding. The pigeon's appearance begins a chain ofmisfortunes throughout the day, as the man (a bank security guard)attempts to calm himself."
5,"Oh man, we need more from Suskind.","I had to get a copy of The Pigeon used after reading Perfume. I read it in one sitting. It's such a gem. I don't know how many pages go by where the main character is just standing in front of this bank thinking, not doing anything. It's riveting. He eats a meal towards the end of the book and I've never read such tasty descriptions of food. And rain, and peeing in the tub, and ripping your pants in public.I'm going to have to do some searching to get my Patrick Suskind fix. This is one of the most satisfying books I've ever read. It left me on a high for a couple weeks. It's since worked it's way somewhere deep in me, I won't forget it."
2,"OK as a short story, but not as a novel.","If this tour de force were a short story, part of a collection, I'd have liked it better. It's too light-weight to take seriously as a separate publication. Jonathan Noel, the main character, is a timid and tidy man who has lived in the same 11 x 7 room for thirty years. One morning he opens the door to his room and finds a pigeon sitting there. This leads to total disruption in his predictable life, his personal unraveling, and his decision to live elsewhere for a few days. If you can identify with this, you are a better person than I!"
3,Looks like a princess brush,The bristles are dipped in pink paint. I am sure its manly for men to wear pink but draw the line here. This product looks too feminine.The product picture doesnt show the pink-dip.
3,Not as good as the first one I ordered from you 2 years ago-too big,"A couple of years ago, I ordered a solid wood, antistatic small hairbrush ""Florence Billon"" and my granddaughter loved it. So I was trying to find it again. I ordered the Phillips light touch brush. It is a very nice brush but too big and not antistatic...and not the one I was looking for...."
1,Ugh.,"Its surf rock in all of its cheesy, awful, stero-typical kitschy glory. The guitar riffs are less than mediocre, the samples are poorly chosen and ill-timed, and the bubble-gum lyrics and vocals go from sexy to scary when you take into consideration that they come from a bunch of 30 something women. The fact that its recorded to sound like a poorly recorded 50s album is the clincher of the deal. Don't waste your time, don't waste your money, and learn from the fact that you can buy a used copy for less than 3 bucks."
2,"STOP , NOW!","OK FIRST OFF IF YOU ARE A HUGE WHITE ZOMBIE FAN LIKE ME, YOU MIGHT THINK YOU NEED THIS ALBUM, BUT TRUST ME, I BOUGHT IT AND IT IS NOTHING LIKE WHITE ZOMBIE, IT IS ALL SURFY AND STUFF. BUT ILL GIVE IT TWO STARS CUZ IT IS A GOOD EFFORT FROM SEAN, AND IT IS GOOD THAT SHE GETS HER OWN BAND NOW, BUT IT ISNT WHITE ZOMBIE AND IF YOU ARENT WHITE ZOMBIE.......WHAT ARE YOU?"
4,Great surfy guitar music for partying or driving.,"White Zombie bassist Sean Yseult has resurrected from the undead as ""Devil Doll"", lead guitarist for the all-girl band Famous Monsters. One look at the cover for their new album ""In the Night!!!"" told me this was not going to be another WZ record -- and good for them! High reverb, low tech. There are more ""vocal interjections"" on this collection than there is singing, which gives the band a unique style that I like. I don't own a lot of surf or rockabilly cd's, and I don't give anything 5 stars unless I'm still playing it 5 years later, but I can see playing this one as much as my Dick Dale and Cramps albums -- which is all the time!"
5,Excellent! Sean Yseult rocks without Rob Zombie!,Even if you aren't a fan of surf music this album is the ultimate good time. And talk about a couple of babes who can rock! This album is highly listenable.
5,Famous Monsters grooves baby,"I loved this album. If you like rockabilly, surf guitar, etc. this album is for you. Especially cool is how much fun the band seems to be having with their music - take a look at the liner notes for a chuckle."
3,A good start,"This text provided the most basic background for selecting the sampling technique. This book is an excellent introduction to basic survey research and provided the framework from which to consider this project. As this project goes beyond the scope of this text, it became necessarily to imagine what alternatives existed given the material provided in this text. Some of the options were available in other texts, such as books on SPSS and GIS computer software, as well as some of the information in Ethnography Step by Step, which provided additional information on computer data collection options available to researchers."
5,Great Gift!,"Great idea for Christmas for the person that collects Coca-Cola products! Love the look of the sign, quite vintage looking!"
5,LOVE IT,HELPED FILL UP SOME SPACE THAT NEEDED A COKE ITEM SINCE MY KITCHEN IS COKE DECOR. I CAN REMEMBER THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS IT WAS BUGGER
3,Coca Cola,This coca cola sing is a tin red and white sine that says coca cola with a green broader. It makes a great decorative peace for bars and restraint. But there is one bad thing it is dented easy and is made out of aluminum.if you agree with me follow me on twitter at cid 101
2,From 1963 - Info now on the Internet,"The article that the author originally published appears as an appendix in this book reprinted in 1988. Although the author is to be lauded for his breakthrough in the field, the book itself is mostly light fluff about the history of the area with the meat of the text in the appendices with the original articles.Most of what is in this book can be found on the Internet in about 10 seconds with a good search engine looking for stonehenge astronomical alignments."
4,Nice jazzy collection of holiday interpretations,"Let's face it: Most holiday compilations fall into one of two cataogories: 1) The same old hit warhorses in the same old versions, trotted out yet again, mixed with a bunch of junk chosen to fill out the CD and save the label on royalties; 2) Unmemorable interpretations by unknowns marketed at a budget price.This collection is neither of those. Instead, what you get is a collection of interpretations by some of the biggest names in the history of jazz and swing. Few of these would be called definitive, but most of these are excellent in their own right. And since you probably already have enough copies of ol' Bing singing ""White Christmas"", this is a nice collection to add into rotation for flavor. At the price, it's a no brainer."
3,Mixed Feelings...,"I really wanted to like this book as much as past reviewers. The story is good, and the plot twists are as well. But the writing... Sometimes the protagonist sounds like a goofy, corny, not terribly intelligent kid. Then she gets really pedantic when she ""explains"" her culture to the reader. Suddenly the author surprises you with a great plot twist, but then reverts to contrived writing. I don't fault the writer. I'm wondering -- where was his editor!?! Also, I hope all folks don't believe that ""all Filipinos"" think or act like this. There are, of course, many exceptions to these descriptions, despite what Ligaya claims."
2,Good but not excellent as I had hoped,"I guess I was hoping for the subtlety and finesse that I have come to expect from Greenwood Cooper productions. The contents of this DVD were much more overt. I also purchased Pools of Desire, also a Greenwood Cooper production, and this DVD was right on target with what I have come to expect from this company."
2,Kind of dumb,This film is not as funning as the other reviewers had said it's a silly movie with zero acting skills
5,good memories,I used to wear out the cassette every morning my senior year in high school and freshman year in college. It helped to wake up with a positive outlook.
5,A Christian Woman's Guide,An excellent book! A woman's guide on how to deepen her relationship with God. Get close to God! Don't wear yourself out!
2,Having a Mary Heart in a Marth World,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. I was buying the book to use in a Bible study, only to find that the study questions were not included. I should not have assumed they would be, I guess, but there was nothing in the description that said that they weren't included."
2,Limited and Over-Priced,"Basically a rip-off, the Peugeot salt mill (not ""electric,"" by the way, but battery-operated) is very difficult to load with batteries and--most important--the grinding mechanism cannot be adjusted; if you use a sea salt like Malden, for instance and just want a slightly less coarse grain, you're out of luck; the Peugeot only has one option and that is very fine (!) grains and only a few at a time so it takes quite awhile to season something properly. In its favor, it's good-looking but, ultimately, no there there."
5,A family favorite,"My girls loved this book when they were toddlers and I read it so often that I have most of it memorized. When I attended a baby shower where the hostess asked us to bring used books, it was my first thought. My adult children were horrified I would part with our copy, so there was nothing to do but buy a new one. ""Wake every person, pig and pup, 'til everyone on earth is up!!!"" Great fun for little ones."
5,Creative!,"""Wake every person, pig, and pup, till everyone on earth is up! Except for me, please go away. No up for me, I'm sleeping in today!"" We are fifth graders and this is our favorite book by Dr. Seuss, Great Day for Up. I can just feel the breeze when I go up, up, up, and away. Think of all the happiness you will miss if you sleep in ... when you can have fun, in all kinds of ways, with Dr. Seuss!!!This book is fun for you and me,wake up your mind and creativity!"
4,Great book for beginning readers.,"Ya, ya, ya so this book teaches about the meanings of the word ""up"". But, to me that takes a backseat to the fun rhythm and rhymes that make a child WANT to be able to read the book by themselves. The small vocabulary, phonetically spelled words and visual clues are wonderful for early readers. My step-son enjoys reading this book together at bedtime and can actually read it to US now. I love the ""bright and early"" books from Dr. Seuss for building early reading skills."
3,A below-average Dr. Seuss Book,"Dr. Seuss has some really brilliant books. This book is just a so-so Dr. Seuss. As a parent who is familiar with about 15 Dr. Seuss books, this is one of my least favorite books.The book attempts to teach the child what ""Up"" means. There is a terrific amount of repetition, and the cleverness in the rhyming and pictures is not ""Up!"" to par with other Dr. Seuss books.My 6-month old children are too young to understand this book, but I think that Mommy and Daddy will tire of the book long before they have gotten the very simple and trivial message in this book : what is the difference between Up and Down ..."
1,Mint refuses to work.,"Ordered & installed part. Mint refused to work. Called tech who assisted. Mint worked for short period. Now the Mint will not work at all. Used to love it. For the amt. of purchase price, I expected years of service. I am very disappointed. Model #4200."
3,different in a good and bad way,"i have happylove by this band and it is amazingly poppy, infectious and lovely. i liked it so much i bought this. what a difference. this cd is much more mellow but the arangemants are a little more complex with more going on in the background. the harmonies are good too between vocals. no doubt this band is talented but i thought they were much better for me as a rock band. by that i mean, happy love is a much louder album and it just jolts you out of your skin.this album is more subtle. there were more good songs than bad and even a handful of amazing tunes. the more upbeat songs hold stronger songwriting while the slower number tend to evoke a good mood."
4,"Made-For-TV movie about the Weather Underground, featuring The Fonz","This should be interesting to anyone who has a decent understanding of what REALLY went down with the Weather Underground and revolutionary struggle in the late 1906s & early 1970s. This, apparently made-for-TV drama, clearly blends events revolving around a number of different individuals into a single character (some Weatherwomen in particular, which is being implied with the title of the movie). It surprisingly does a pretty thorough job at briefly explaining a number of the political concepts and evolutions that many experienced during those years of struggle. But don't be mistaken, this is a B-movie by any definition (although the Fonz honestly shows some acting ability in here, which was a highlight). While I personally enjoyed this, I would surely not substitute it for any real historical information.. especially the ending."
5,A great movie,"For it's time, this is a great movie. As usual Sissy plays the part perfectly. Really quite a shame there aren't more movies out there like this."
3,worthWatching,"Despite the lack of any music from that era, it is an important story. I've known one or two American radical feminists who had strong passions re; justice based ideas and activism; I knew an American woman who called herself a revolutionary. The 60s radicalized a lot of people. But the movie doesn't go into the depth of revolutionary thought, and even not much attempt to capture any of the psychedelic imagery of the time; in my opinion, the story-line fails to make a correlation between her early years in the south American jungles, her radicalization and the extreme ending. To find out how it ends, watch it, it's worth the rental price f'sure."
1,Black & White,"I little different review. Katherine was a good TV movie back in the 70's. Showed the progression of a do-gooder truly trying to help the world turning into a radical who didn't mind blowing up the world. So many people went down that road. In the end, I felt more sorrow for Katherine's family than for Katherine. She chose her own path. Anyway, I bought the Katherine DVD and received a movie in black and white. Katherine was originally in color back in the 70's, and Katherine is supposed to be in color according to the DVD case. Anyone else have this problem? Amazon gave me a refund so money isn't the issue. I'm just afraid that if I buy the Katherine DVD again, the same thing will happen and I won't get a refund this time. Has anyone bought the new Katherine DVD? Was it in color?"
1,Ashes OF Roses,"A 16 yr old girl, Rose, faces chalenges in her life, starting with a long jouney to america, then learning to let go of her little brother, who has an eye infection. after a terible time in her uncle's flat, her mother goes back to irland, while Rose and her sister stay behind in america.many other things come up, also.read the book to find out why her only friends in america died."
5,I Hate Books With History and LOVED This!!!!!,"In the book Ashes of Roses, by Mary Jane Auch there was a family of six comng to america from ireland in 1911 and when they got to america the youngest of the four children is diagnosed with an eye illness and is not allowed to comce to america, so the father takes him back and the three girls and the mom stay in americ, then the mom get homesick and takes the youngest daughter with her back to ireland and leaves the two oldest girls in america on their own. The two sisters make it through the teriangle waist factory fire and lots of discrimination torwards them. This book is an overall book of loving sisterly kindness, and i would highly reccomend it for readers of all age."
4,Ashes of Roses,"Ashes of Roses is a very interesting book. It has lots of historical reference to the Ellis Island immigration period, and is very well written.The main character, Rose Nolan, makes the long voyage with her family to New York City from Ireland. It is a terrible, harsh voyage, and when they finally arrive, are forsed to make a horrible descision. The baby boy of the family is examined, and found to have a minor disease called Trachoma. Her father must take him back to Ireland, and Rose and her sister and mother are left to fend for themselves in the city.When they arrive at their uncle's house, it is made very clear that they are unwelcome. His two daughters act snooty and spoilt, and I can feel Rose's anger and pain as if I were actually there with her. She is forsed to maintain a painstaking job making paper flowers for little pay just to help her small family get by.A very nice book, but it drags on a little in certain parts. Over all, I would reccomend it."
4,"Powertful, moving and intelligent","The novel ""Ashes of Roses"" is a powerful, moving and intelligent book. I highly recommend it for all ages. The story is based in the Nolan family who travels from the streets of Limrick, Ireland. They take a boat trip to ""The Streets of Gold"" in New York. Once the family of six (Michael Nolan, Father, Margaret Nolan-Mother, Margaret Rose Nolan- Oldest sister 16, Maureen Nolan- middle sister 12, Bridget Nolan- Youngest sister 4, and Joseph Nolan- young infant (brother) are about to enter America, Joseph gets sick with an eye disease which prevents his entry into America. Michael chose to return to Ireland with Joseph, while Margaret, Rose, Maureen and Bridget find their way through America. Throughout the story, the author Mary Jane Auch is very precise with the Irish and Yiddish accents. The book really helped me understand and connect with the characters learning about the hard life to live in America. Enjoy!"
5,4-wheeler cover,"This is a very nice cover. I would recommend this to everyone. When I first put it on, my husband didn't even see it. Fits perfect."
1,stupid,This film is a stupid film. It is a cpoy of The Last House on the Left. This is one of the worst films i have ever seen. It should be avioded by everyone.
1,Couldn't even stand to finish watching it,"Okay, this is positively one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie is nothing but plotless nudity, violence, etc. etc. etc. Okay okay, maybe that's your thing. If so, then I suppose you'll love this movie. But after I got about half way through it, it dawned on me that nothing was going to happen but more of the same. I figured the good guys would end up winning out in the end and maybe the ending would be okay, but by the time I stopped the movie, I just didn't care and wanted to watch something else.Bottom line, if you love plotless movies, violence and nudity, go for it. But if you like a story with a plotline, stay away!"
4,A Very Good Film. Could've been alot better.,"Overall 4 stars, this movie had much potential to be a classic but sluggish parts and some toned down important scenes eventually keep it from being a great. One of the actors looks just like Axel Rose and he acts like him too... David Hess is good and this film certainly has its moments, one of the better Italian horrors Ive seen"
3,The House on the Edge of the Park stars David Hess,"Ruggero 'Cannibal Holocaust' Deodato directed this film under a psyudom. The film is about a couple of criminal rapist thugs that invade a party run by rich yuppie types and casual cocain users and teach them a lesson in brutality and sleaze they won't soon forget. The film has a few shocking scenes that you would have come to expect from the Reggro Deodato. David Hess plays a very vicious role, carrrying on and exceeding his role in Wes Cravins, Last House on the Left."
2,Horror? Wrong Genre.,"I rented this movie thinking it was going to be a horror flick. From the description, it doesn't sound too bad. It sounds pretty exciting. The real thing? Kind of a disaster. From the very beginning featuring a rape scene, I began thinking to myself, what am I watching? It definitely didn't get any better from there.It managed to be somewhat entertaining, but at the expense of unnecessary nudity and fake violence. The only reason I kept watching was to see the ending. They tried to salvage it with this big revelation, that really didn't make much sense at all either way. If interested in this movie, just keep in mind - it's not horror. I don't even know what it is, and I'm still asking myself what I just saw."
2,Not worth the 90 minutes,"I give it 2 stars for the ending, but that's where it ends...For those who have seen it and are disappointed, or want something somewhat...better? I recommend ""I spit on your grave"". Same idea, but a much better movie. xoxo"
3,"David Hess and Ruggero Deodato, you can't go wrong!","A lot of people say this is Italy's answer to Last House on the Left...The only real similarities between the two films is David Hess and the similar titles.The film is about a pair of psychopaths (David Hess and Italy's whipping boy John Morghen) who make their way to a party populated by yuppies and take them all hostage. Hess is very good at his role, playing a very unlikable guy, but even with his stellar performance the film falls a bit short.Not Deodato's best film, but still a nice little exploitation flick."
2,The House on the Edge of the Park,"The movie starts rape and then it ends up in a garage after the main titles roll. We met the two main characters-Ricky and Alex. A car pulls up and needs service. I dont know if it is after hours or what but I digress. Alex soon learns from the woman that there is a small party going on and he invites himself and Ricky. At the house, a group of people want to humiliate the two men who crashed the party. Alex catches on to this fact and that is where the film slowly turns into something worth watching. The movie is slow paced, predictable, and tame compared to what alot of reviewers said about the film. Alex is worth watching as Ricky is just a tag along and really doesnt add much to the film but a stupid laugh. I wouldn't really recommend this movie to many people. The only cool thing about the movie was the awesome cover."
5,one of the best children's chapter book ever,"As a teacher I have read this book many many times to students. The children are so in love with the story they don't want to miss a single day of school for fear of missing any of it. I have also always found that upon reading the final word, the response is, ""can we read it again?"". This is truly a unique and special story that I have read to first, second and third graders. I am so thankful it is back in print as my original copy was a very worn photo copied version of a much earlier publication."
5,ORIGNIALITY MEETS TRADITION,"She exemplified new world dawning thru unsaid symbols of freedom. Utilizing traditional settings in ways yet unseen and that would come define her short reign of Her Royal Hihness, Diana, princess of wales . Single handily pushing old tradition into the mainstream and in effect pop culture.Although no Saint, perhaps a sinner the balance of good outweighed the bad hands down.Lovely imagery, wonderful imagination fantastic documentary."
4,Works well,"Fits perfectly under my rectangular planter box. The material is a bit flimsy, but it's also cheap, so it works fine. Worth the money as it does its job."
3,"Some good music on here, but...","If you are looking for a quintessential Bluegrass music documentary, then this one isn't it. This video does two things well. It showcases a small subset of innovative artists who have branched out from playing traditional bluegrass. It gives you some interesting insight into the culture of Bluegrass festivals.If you dig Chris Thile, the McCoury's or Tim O'Brian you will absolutely love it."
3,Nice journey but not much bluegrass.,There's a lot of good music in this DVD but not enough real bluegrass and mountain folk. It's interesting that most of the festivals in the documentary were in geographical areas not normally associated with Bill Monroe and many of the people were from cities such as Los Angeles. There's nothing wrong with that but the contrast between the Del McCourey Band and Chris Thile's Nickel Creek is pretty dramatic. It's sort of like the difference between Wild Turkey Bourbon and blended canadian whiskey. Del is the real thing.
5,This dvd got me thru a cold Chicago winter,"All I can say about this was ""wow!!"". What a documentary! Highly recommended."
5,Reliving my youth,"I read this book many years ago and loved it. A nice, relaxing read with enough suspense to keep one interested until the very end. Glad to see it is once again available."
3,Not my favorite,"The only Mary Stewart mystery-romance book written in the third person left me wishing she'd written it in the first person. The suspense was too mitigated by use of the third person, and the overall premise weak (maybe it was plausible years ago but not now). Certainly, not in league with ""Madam Will You Talk?"" After 50 years, that book is still as suspenseful as when I first read it."
3,Good News Bible,Would have been nice to have known the size. Very small to read. Other than that is was good. Thank you.
4,Good News Bible,What can I review. It was as I expected. I just wanted something easier to understand for my granddaughter.Easy transaction and book in excellent condition
2,Good news bible,I specifically wanted the (TEV) Today's English Version and you sent me the (GNT) Good New's Translation. I find that disturbing.
3,It's smaller than I expected,"Though I like the Good News Bible and ordered it for a friend, I didn't give it to her because it is too small. So I gave her another version."
3,Not as good as the cider,"I love their cider so much. So I ordered some of this, and was hoping to use it in hot chocolate and for other drinks etc.I just don't love it. It tastes like Tang, and if you mix it with hot chocolate is separates- which makes sense, it's a citrus thing- but I was hoping I could get away with this and some hot chocolate mix and make an orange hot chocolate. Not to be."
5,I love them!,"I had the oppertunity to see this band play and I was blown away! At first I didn't think I would like them but they were amazing! My fave songs are Make you move, Aint about you, under the eyes, and all that. But they are all great dont get me wrong. :)"
2,unsited console,i believe they are very good. I was told by a dj friend of mine that it is the better of the midi mixers to use on my coputer programme. that been DJ DECKS. Well worth the small investment.i hope to have my console soon.
4,This was actually one of the first chapter books I ever read.,"And so I remember it fondly.Now that I've read more widely, and many more sci-fi books, I know that this one is not new. If you've read one city-in-a-dome story, well, this one doesn't add anything.But to introduce a child to the genre... Well! That's another kettle of fish. You can hardly do better than this one."
1,fawning useless tribute servile pape. do not was you time or money!!,A fawning tribute to a man god of the first order. Still cannot understand why anyone except his mother would publish this drivel. I got the book at the library and feel cheated.
1,Go to the dentist and have a better time!,"I just saw a production of this miserably written play. Even Kenneth Branaugh and Lawrence Olivia caliber acting wouldn't improve this turkey! There is no plot, no characters with even one redeeming quality and an ending that just, well...ends, though not soon enough! I was almost trampled in the stampede of exiting audience members during the intermission. It just amazes me that the author even found a publisher, much less a vendor! Save your money on this one, going to the dentist would be more enjoyable!"
2,Background noise ruins otherwise charming performance!,"This is a charming example of the talent that was Chimarosa. The sparkling score enhances. The singers, excellent. The problem? It was recorded live, and although a certain amount of background noise is inevitable, this recording sounds as if storm troopers in hobbnail boots are clomping through the scenery for most of the opera, ruining an otherwise beautiful performance. Unfortunately, it is the only recording currently in the catalog. And expensive, too."
4,Amazon Alvin,I was very grateful to Amazon for this CD [Revive us Again ]as I could not purchase it in Australia and although it is technically second hand it is still in perfect condition.I needed to get the details of one song in particular and the only way was from the album. Also the price was very reasonable so thank you again AmazonJim Hopkin
4,good revival songs,"If you are waitting for the revival of The Holy Spirit to come, this is a very good CD which will take you deep in worship and set up your heart for it."
5,Great Informative Book,"This is a great book. It gives you alot of info about the breed, including problems associated with the breed, and things to look out for. A must for any peke owner, particularly for a first time peke owner."
5,Shear Brilliance,"This is simply one of the best recordings I have ever purchased, and I've been at it for 25 years. Rest in peace, Mr. Shearing."
5,"great price, great product, thanks walker",this product came to my house fast and i mean A triple plus. this product came the way they said and i installed one on my car so far. guess what i am a happy customer and i will always support walker from now on because the product not only was just like my oem product on the car that sucked but it has better flow and also gives the car a great sound but not something that you want to baffle. thanks walker you guys are doing something good and amazon makes that better.
3,Wasn't what i thought it would be.,"The seller was great, sent the book as promised. This book is a colaboration of love making art, and the history behind it. Lots of pictures, paintings and sculptures. Not what i was looking for."
4,Royce Leather oversized passport holder,"I like this item Royce Passport Holder . I like that it is thin so it is not bulky and heavy . Simple design . The only flaw in the design is that the passport slot is a bit too tight. If I continue to use it the way it is design to be it will ripped apart . The only way to preserve its longevity is to insert the passport in the slot intended for cash bills. This may be a slight flaw of design but this is fairly common in wallets ,that is why it is important to try to insert credit cards or other cards on those slot in the wallet that one may be interested to buy .This is common in those wallets sold in the sidewalk ."
1,Royce Leather Passport and Ticket Holder,The Price of this item is Extremely High which it should not be. It should not be more than a range of $10-$15. No Zipper at all for extra protection or security. Without zipper any thing can be fallen easily that the case may be loosing important document. No section or space for putting pen or ballpoint pen. No front or back side pocket or separate section with zipper. Zipper means the extra security is very important and is missingtoo. I am not satisfied with this item at all. Not recommended to any body. I paid too much money to buy this product.Surendra Surana
4,Classic Rock,"A mix of your favorite oldies and classical, orchestra, night-at-the-opera style music, this cd is composed of nine tracks of literal classic rock. It's great for all you insomniacs that have to listen to music in order to fall asleep---it's really relaxing (think enya). It's a real must-have."
1,No specs on what size steering wheel it will fit,You ought to put down what size steering wheel this cover fits...no one wants to buy the wrong size steering wheel cover
3,Needs a new edition,"I think this book is a great idea and have found the information it contains helpful. However, as stated above, many of its recommended titles are out of print, and when I look up new titles for a filter to help me know if it's appropriate for my 8 year old, it is frequently unable to help me, as so much has been published since 1987."
4,In defense of Samuel Hofer,"I have read all of Hofer's books on colony life, both fiction and non-fiction and have found them all immensely helpful. His writing style is honest, if a bit naive. His books run the gamut from researched and documented to biographical, but all ring truthful. I recommend them as references to flesh out the scientific research. From a sociological point of view, nothing compares to the landmark book ""Hutterite Society"" by Hochstetler and Huntington."
1,This book is full of biases and inaccuracies.,"I specificaly read this book because I enjoy seeing how outsiders (non-Hutterites) perceive Hutterites. After all, I am a Hutterite myself.I found Hofer's book to be loaded with assumptions, biases and untruths. Many of the ""facts"" that he presents, especially in the recent history section of the book are extremely biased and untruthful; in fact, little of what he writes in this section could be taken for fact. He must have used ""warped"" sources, else his sources are totally unaware and ignorant of recent Hutterite history. I think Hofer should have attempted to paint a balanced picture in his book. Otherwise, perhaps he should focus on areas in which he can do proper research."
5,Shag bag,"I bought this item for my husband and so far, he absolutely loves it. It seems very durable and can get heavy when it is full of golf balls. The Shag bag makes it fun to collect the balls after a session of putting or chipping."
4,"Great scent, lotion does its job.",This is a very pleasant hand lotion -the scent is noticeable but not too strong. The lotion works very well without being greasey.
4,Mostly enjoyed. A couple disappointments.,"Overall I enjoyed the book. I liked seeing the new background to the story. I wonder how much of it was cut from the movie, and how much of it was created by Wayland Drew. The beginning starts out well. There were a few small but nice scenes from the movie that were not in the book. That was a bit disappointing, because there was no need to cut them out. Madmartigan's character seemed to be slightly off, and in my opinion the ending in the book wrapped things up a little too quickly."
5,"Willow, a fantastic Fantasy book!","I read the book afther I saw the movie and I loved it. It has the same storyline as the movie, but adds just that extra bit to the characters to keep you clued to the book. I found it exiting and my favorite character Madmartigan was described wonderful. I bought the book just a month ago....and raed it about 5 times."
2,Willow,This book was not the edition I was looking for-some of the story line was missing from this edition. The book was in great condition though. thanks
1,Vehicle applicability is wrong,"Seller needs to update vehicle application chart as this filter does NOT fit a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee as claimed. Design changed for the 2011 model year and the JGC now uses a different style filter. Luckily I have a neighbor who can use this filter in his 2009 JGC, otherwise I'd be out the $'s."
5,Bonanza Bigtime Fan,"Being a big fan of Bonanza, I am trying to get the complete season sets and your product has bee the best so far for playback, other sets I have bought at other sites are copies from different TV stations and playback as they tape, freeze frames and all."
1,Not as described,I just bought this bag from amazon. I am very unhappy with it. The bag had airlift 1.1 instead of 2.1. The product description with the bag says it can hold laptop upto 14.1 inch. But the product description on this page says 15.1. I checked it with my 15.1 inch laptop. It does not fit. I am planning to return this item. I wonder they supplied incorrect product information.
5,Great Student Computer/Bookbag!!,"1. The Airlift system really works like a charm. The weight is distributed equally so that even when you have a full bag you won't feel crushed.2. The material of the bag and the compartments it have makes the bag quite water proof (tested with the Northwest weather... need I say more?)3. The compartment for the CD/iPod/Cell phone/Key Holder is perfectly located and easy to reach; there is also a jack for the headphone wire.4. There is a computer compartment with some moderate amount of soft padding.5. The capacity this backpack holds is good for school, but not much for traveling.This backpack is good for students who carry books as well as computers and who might need to walk a lot.Highly recommended!!!"
5,Awesome Bag,"When my bag came in, I wasn't expecting it to be able to fit everything I needed for school. To my surprise, I was able to put in my laptop & accessories, 4 books, 3 binders, water bottle,, lunch, mp3 player and I still had extra room. This bag is very sturdy. I'm really surprised the strap hasn't snapped yet. All around great bag."
4,Love this roomy backpack and all the pockets :),"I am a college student and this backpack is perfect for me. I have the red/gray version and it looks a little sporty with that color combination. It has an external mesh pocket for a beverage, 2 external stash pockets, one organizer section for pens/cell phone/laptop charger, and 2 main full-length sections for books and a 15"" laptop. The straps are super comfortable due to the gel material on the upper parts. I carry a lot of weight in the pack daily and I don't feel it on my shoulders at all. My only complaint is that the height dimension is rather tall, so the pack looks a little bulky even if it's not completely full. The size would be too large for a kid or a petite person. This is a great updated backpack with comfort features, and I think it's worth the cost."
4,"Intrigue, suspense and shadows from the past.","In 1905, a young Danish couple arrive in England with their two small sons. The husband, Rasmus, becomes a total Anglophile while his wife Asta, struggles with language problems,loneliness and depression as she is left alone with the children for long periods of time while Rasmus travels on business.To while away the hours, Asta starts a diary which she continues for the majority of her life. Years later, her descendants discover and publish the diaries which become an international success and which bring to life a number of unanswered questions about a sensational murder trial and the dubious birth of one of Asta's daughters. At first I struggled with the various characters, finding it difficult to place them in the right generations but all became clear eventually. The plot is involved, with red herrings strewn all over the place--an intriguing read and worth perservering with as all the solutions come right at the end of the book."
5,Deserves 6 stars,Great book. Very well written. A pleasure to read. Highly recommended. 6 out of 5 starts.
1,"One star for title change, 5 stars for quality","I try very hard to read all Barbara Vine's books. I read a lot of books however, so it can be hard to keep up with any single author's works. Sometimes I miss when a new work comes out. (I'm lobbying Amazon to provide a service that notifies from an author wish list.)I don't know why the title on this book got changed. Apparently it was initially Asta's Book and was changed to ""Anna"" for the US edition.My low rating is just an attempt to provide a warning to others so they don't end up buying the same book twice as I did. And yes, I did read the synopsis before I bought the Asta title, but the one I read sounded very different from the Anna plot as I recalled it. Chalk it up to an aging memory that publisher tricks don't accommodate."
2,Clarks Women's Metti Low Pump,"I was disappointed in this shoe. Even though it seems very well made, it is not comfortable. The construction/ stitching near the little toe created a pressure point. I tried different sock weights without success."
3,Clarks again,These shoes are on the tight side. Some of the other reviews said they were very comfortable. I define very comfortable as good right out of the box. These may take some breaking in and I hope my little toe survives it! Love the detail on the top and the heel is a good height for work.
2,Not For me....,These shoes rubbed where the leather was stitched on the top and were not as comfortable as I was expecting. I ordered some softspots. I hope they will be a little more comfortable.
2,Nice shoe but painful to walk in,"These are nice shoes; however, the right one caused significant pain to my right foot where the little strap connects to the side of the shoe. I was on vacation and as we were walking from the hotel to Thanksgiving dinner at a nice restaurant, my foot was hurting so much that most of the way there and all the way back I walked with my right foot half-out of the shoe....very uncomfortable. I have not worn them for walking very far since then."
2,In a word...Ouch!,"I have always wanted a pair Clark's shoes but could never justify spending that much money on a pair of shoes for myself. I finally caught a break and was able to get this shoe at a very reasonable price and I have to say...Ouch! These shoes hurt. They are very true to size, the proper width, etc, but the little strap that comes around the vamp to the side of the shoe digs into your foot. It is excruciating by the end of the day. I had to raid the first aid kit at work for band-aids to put over the spot that was being tortured on my foot.This is the absolute wrong shoe for me, but it may be great for someone else."
2,"Nice, but returned","The cross is very nice, but larger than expected. I'm looking for an extremely small cross. Beware the chain clasp. The ring end was bent (received that way) to fit through the bail on the back of the cross and wouldn't slide on the clasp end for security."
5,One book for all your high tech etiquette needs!,"This is an amazing book that covers all grounds.A book like this was needed for a long time now. I really enjoyed how it was written to include both a personal touch of narratives and professional steps to achieve proper `netiquette'. Easy reading makes for a wonderfully crafted work.If you use e-mails, faxes, voice mails, cell phones, etc. in your everyday life (work and home), this book will have you communicating like you were trained at Windsor Castle.""Good manners will open doors that the best education cannot."" said by Clarence Thomas. I agree, and this book should have you opening those doors."
4,Afro-beat with a political message,"There is great percussion here, definitely an afro-funk sound. The lyrics are clear, interesting and a nice alternative to hip-hop. There is a definite political message here, with lyrics like ""Stop it, put your guns and your rockets, back in your pockets.""If you like Frank Zappa, Home Cookin', the title cut will be really, really familiar. I found this very listenable. This cd will appeal to a strangely broad set of music listeners, from old Zappa fans, to those looking for new flavor in Hip-Hop to people who like political songs, to those who love afro-funk percussion. An interesting album."
2,"What's It All About, Mr. Fat?","I tried hard to understand this film until I finally understood: it is incomprehensible, a mishmash. No one figured out where the film was going or what it was about. They just filmed it. Sime nice colors, some fair (for HK movies) action sequences, nice camera angles. And talk like you're overhearing a bunch of random telephone conversations. A dish of Chinese noodles is far more coherent than the strands of this movie. And yet, we should encourage these Hong Kong types to make more movies in the US. They do bring a nice perspective. So far, it seems that the lavish Hollywood budgets have corrupted these movies. The high budget certainly seems to have corrupted THE CORRUPTOR. We have to get back to basics, i.e., a good screenplay. Once you have that, bring in the Hong Kong stars and directors. Bring in Chingmy Yau, while you're at it. Bottom line: (and I hate to say this on Amazon) you'd be better off renting this movie than buying it."
5,Actually a sweet movie with Chow and Marky Mark,"I like things to do with japanese, and chinese stuff, espeacially movies, I like Black Rain, Blade Runner cop movies, having to do with the chinese mob, and this movie was sweet. Great action, and a good story of what seems to be a corrupt cop with a white internal affairs officer in Cinatown of New York. They are up against some mean azz chinese guys. Lots of cool violence, and a cool car chase make this movie top on my action list, I am getting a DVD player this christmas, and since I own most of my favs. on VHS, this movie will be one of the first on my DVD list."
2,Good features Poor film!,"It's a shame that some other distributors dont take a leaf out of this book for features, better films than this could benifit from having such great features. I am afraid that the film, for me, was a total borefest. I would have thought Marky Mark would have gone for a better film after such a great performance in Boogie Nights."
1,Just shooting and shooting and shoo-... BORING!,I only watched the beginning because it was so bad. It had so much bad language and it was just shooting and shooting and shooting and shooting and shooting! Let me guess what happened after the lamp store shootout. MORE SHOOTING! This is so absurd. It just focuses on action scenes and not the plot. A very boring action movie. Chow Yun-Fat is the worst actor. Tell OJ Simpson to see this movie or something.
3,Wahlberg and Yun-Fat at their best,"I have been a fan of Mark Wahlberg since Fear. Although he usually plays a similar character, he always treats us with a combination of innocence and violence. Although Boogie Nights was his breakthough film, I think his performance in The Corruptor raises his respectability as an actor to a new level. In fact he's so rooted in acting now that it's hard to imagine him as Marky Mark rapping about Sunkist in his video ""Good Vibrations"". But even then there was something street level and real about him that completely eclipsed his brother Donny from New Kids on the Block. Chow Yun-Fat also has grown since The Replacement Killers, filling out a broader range of emotions onscreen. He's still a bit stiff, but he's getting there. The story itself is old school buddy cop territory, with another tried and true twist towards the end. These two manage to make it seem fresh again however."
4,"Honestly, one of Chow Yun Fat's finest acting jobs.","I was really surprised at how good this film was. Chow Yun Fat was absolutely mesmerizing. Both he and Mark Wahlbergh create an unexpected chemistry between their two characters. This is a lot more restrained in the action department than the usual John Woo directed gun fest, but it's actually a welcome respite from the cartoonish violence in most of Fat's films. Robert Foley, the director, struck a good balance: There is enough action and acrobatics to satisfy most HK action fans, while a strong plot and good performances round out the rest of the film.This is a good American crossover for Fat's cool charisma and tragic hero character."
1,Don't buy from here!!!,"I waited forever for them to send it. The due date has come and gone, and it's still not arrived. I will never buy from this seller again, and reccomend you don't either. I had to give them 1 star, but truthfully I would give them no stars."
2,Not Hong Kong action...,"I expected this to be an action packed killing spree, with superb Hong Kong style cinematography and an okay plot. Instead, what I received was a very good story with average cinematography and hardly any Hong Kong killings!The key to this movie is the relationship between the two leads, and this comes across rather well, despite the aprehension of Marky Mark being in there. He does himself proud, but C-Y Fat drops a peg or two on the action ladder.The film is not your average shoot-em-up, nor is it your average thriller. It fails on both counts, think Internal Affairs meets Showdown in Little Tokyo, without the best bits of either.Though I'd like to give it more, it failed to capture the imagination, and countering that, it failed to provide enough bullets for a Terminator 2 type rating.Avoid it if you want Hong Kong action, buy it if you like the actors and want to relax with a passable plot, backed up by a weak cast."
2,.,"Another relatively bad American action movie assisted soley by the presence of Chow-Yun Fat. To its credit, it is better than the Replacement Killers; as uncondonable as Mark Wahlberg is, he is much easier to take than Mira Sorvino. Additionally, the story in this one is a touch more interesting, though the buddy-cop aesthetic, action sequences, and just about everything else, were all done ten times better in Chow's Hong Kong films. It's a pity to see his charisma and talent wasted in all of this b-grade American tripe."
2,High hopes wre shot down,I had high hopes for The Corruptor as I thought a movie with Yun-Fat and Walhberg would be decent but I was wrong. The direction by James Foley is very slow paced and the action seqeunces are long and drawn out. I say if you're a die hard fan of Yun-Fat check this out other wise avoid it.
4,good movie,"I am stuck between a 3 and a 4 but since the movie was so good, I have to give it a 4. The only reason I give it a 3.5 is because I need my bad guys to be really bad. Then they opened up Chow Yun Fat's character so much I almost forgot about it. Mark Walbergh is good as always. There is a lot of acting going on. When I say acting I am talking about these guys using all the tools. From facial expressions to saying the line just right, the director did a very good job. Movie comes in at about 2 hours but keeps you really into it for almost the entire film. This is by far Chow's best American performance. Make sure you check out The Killer if you are a big Chow fan.DVD is widescreened with 2 good special features. One has interviews and the behind the scenes is more like a documentary. There is also a commentary with the director james Foley."
3,Interesting to watch,"The Corruptor is an interesting movie.However, it has a convoluted storyline that is almost as chaotic as Natural Born Killers yet has not been pulled off in as clean or professional manner. The acting is mediocre and the shoot-outs gratuitous and many people may like the action, but the story is difficult to follow because there is no clean line defining who is good or bad or in between...Three Stars because it is a complete tale of betrayal and corruption yet could have used some better acting and more development for the plot.If you like action and guns, you should enjoy this movie. If you like a good plot and easy-to-understand character development, view at your own risk."
3,riveted,"this DVD is loaded , movie rocks. hard hitting crime-boiled action with bumpin' soundtrack..."
3,"Not bad film, but loads of extra's make for a excellent DVD","I bought this dvd after first seeing it at the cinema,I thought that all the extra's on the dvd just added to a really great action dvd.there is a brilliant car chase scene were Chow yun-fat nearly gets decapitated when he crashes into the back of a truck, he was excellent as was mark wahlberg.A must for all fans"
3,"Impressive action, weak plot, bad acting","This film has some impressive action scenes (as you'd expect from any Chow Yun flick), but the rest is full of cliches. I don't mind cliches as long as they're done well (not every film can re-invent the wheel), but in this case it is done with bad acting, with Chow Yun being the only notable exception. I still recommend it to Chow Yun fans, and the RC2 version of this DVD is packed with extras, the best of which is the uncensored car chase (a real BLOODbath!)."
4,Chow Yun-Fatand Mark what's his name do a new kind of killer,"Snunk in to see this thinkng it was garbage and they were wasting Chow Yun-Fat skills, boy was I wrong. I'm getting the DVD even if there aren't any seens with extra footage but it's a worthy addition to the Killer and A Better Tomorrow and HardBoiled. Mark did better in The Big Hit but Chow Yun-Fat needed someone to be his sidekick."
1,A huge disappointment,"James Redfield got greedy and took this to the publisher too soon. What a shame!! It could have been a good sequel to Celestine Prophecy. Writing quality deserved a ""D"" at best. Recall it and try again Mr. Redfield"
1,Don't waste your time.,"I really enjoyed the Celestine Prophecy, but the Tenth Insight was not worth the money that I payed for it. I made it half way through the first chapter and I had to stop. While the Celestine Prophecy was thought provoking, the Tenth Insight (or what I read of it) pushed the boundaries of reality and spirituality way past the breaking point."
3,"Not as good as the first book, but still important","The Tenth Insight is not as good a read as The Celestine Prophesy and doesn't even seem to be written by the same person most of the time. It is full of important informatin and learning, however, so bear with it. The third book is great, too."
4,The Tenth Insight,"I enjoyed this book. If you liked the Celestine Prophecy, you will like this one also. Both are fast paced, full of action, and interesting."
4,very insightful,This book talks about the natural evolution of mankind and for those of us scientists wondering about what is next this is a must read.
4,The apex of spiritual reward--for 15 bucks!,"As basically a spiritually benighted Neanderthal whose only soul is on the bottom of his shoes, I would be happy to have even one spiritual revelation in life, but the estimable Mr. Redfield has had 10. I can only hope that sometime I can ascend from the spiritual nadir of my present circumstances to the enviable empyrean heights of our enlightened author. In my book, both Bo Derek and the author rate a 10."
1,Sorry but I couldn't get anything from it!,Normally I only read non-ficition books because there are so many good non-ficitoin books that I am learning from. A few years ago I decided to read a fiction book because of a recommendation from a good friend. It was the Celestine Prophecy and I thoroughly enjoyed it. When I heard of The Tenth Insight I felt it was a good time to read a second fiction book. However I was truly disillusioned. I tried twice to read the book. I eventually got half way through the book. I could not understand the book. I tried it twice. I got nothing out of it! I read an average of 45 minutes every morning at 5 to 6am. I have read over 450 non-fiction books but only one book and a half of fiction.
5,THE MUST READ BOOK EVER WRITTEN!!,"This book brings all the first nine insights into complete perspective. It explains so much about how people are living now a days and how people ""aren't"" living.....Everyone needs a study class on this book...It has changed my life."
5,Outstanding! One of my favorite books.,Your enjoyment of this book is in direct proportion to the level of your personal understanding of the Cosmic.
2,Skip this one,"The Tenth Insight doesn't hold a candle to it's stellar predecesor, The celestine prophesy, which was an excellent read."
3,Potluck at the spiritual table.,"As one of the previous reviewers have stated, I was a little confused about the reason for this book. Perhaps I am not spiritially developed or possibly this is a confusing book. I think the world that has not been fully discovered/developed is the spiritual aspect. So I believe the author is right in this respect. After that, the author starts rambling about original growth forest, reincarnation, and new family structures, etc. This confused me as well as other readers. I am sure there are better books out there about discovering you spiritual identity."
1,"Insipid, simplistic, terrible","I bought the Tenth Insight as library discard for $1 -- I wish I could get my money back!His philosopy is ridiculous in many ways. I believe in reincarnation, but nothing like he describes it. Frequently in the book the characters remember their past lives and the relationships they each had with each other, and problems of the past being acted upon today.The one clincher that really got me was when one character suggests all suppliers reduce their prices 10%, and this would cure inflation. How simple minded do you have to be to think this is remotely possible?I would rate The Celestine Prophecy about 6 or 7, and the tenth Insight a -1thank you for listening."
1,Was Redfield on Drugs?,"Te Celestine Prophecy is the only book I've ever read more than once. I love it. I started the Tenth Insight immediately after finishing the Celestine Prophecy for the second time and I couldnt beleive this was written by the same author. Did something happen to Redfield between writing these 2 books? Most of the first book is very believable and enlightening, but the second is a complete whirlwind of nuttiness and mostly, in my opinion, totally over the top. I found myself skipping page upon page of rambling. Very weird, and a little disappointing really!"
5,Wonderful possiblity of why we are here,"Presented in a simplistic fashion, the Celestine Prophecy offers a very nice vision of our present potential and future possibility. Not meant to be a bible for those that need to cling, but simply as a vision of what we can achieve. Anyone out there with questions and a sense of a spiritual awakening can truly believe that we are reaching a point of ""critical mass"" in our colective consciousness, where by shear weight of numbers a possible transformation of our world culture is possible.Well worth the read, and the exercises that are in it are worth attempting just for your own growth. The world is changing and we can all co-create this new existance."
1,"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me!","I will admit-I bought in to the hype surrounding The Celestine Prophecy. It read like a decent episode of MacGyver-thinly plotted, obvious, but you stayed with it to see how it would turn out. The ""Insights"" were pleasant and one could apply them to everyday life. Thinking the second would be another quick and easy adventure read, I picked it up. Completely unreadable, full of badly written hallucinogenic passages that wouldn't pass muster in a standard trippy 1960's psychedelic film like The Trip or Psych-Out. To cleanse my soul, I turned to Martin Amis' The Information and Elmore Leonard's Riding The Rap-I feel much better"
2,Disappointing,"Although there are some interesting moments on the path to human enlightenment, the author spends too much time on gratuitous chase scenes. They slow the narrative. However, I do like the efforts the characters make to push fear away by emanating the energy of love. These are realistic, useful practices."
3,The Celestine Series,"I found the Celestine Prophesy thought provoking, but was a little disappointed with the tenth insight. It didn't flow as smoothly and was more difficult to digest. However, I've read the next book in the series, The Secret of Shambhala, and am now reading the final book in the series, the Twelfth Insight, and they are both in the flavor of the original Celestine Prophesy. All of have been creative and interesting and encourage the reader to evaluate personal values and behavior. I am intrigued by the spiritual rather than traditional religious interpretations of the Bible. The interpretations struck a chord in me and the blending of science and spirituality is in line with my own personal beliefs. I highly recommend the Celestine series to readers."
3,Sequel to The Celestine Prophecy,"There are 9 insights are in the first book, so we get only 1 new insight in this book. The new insight is really nothing new, as it's parts are mostly contained already within the other 9.The story is ok, but it did not really grab me. Like the first book the story will bog down with preachy ramblings. Our hero in the book fails to apply the insights previously learned. While this might be true to human nature, and make for a good example in a self-help guide, it doesn't fly too well for me as part of an adventure novel.Entertainment: 3 starsEnlightenment: 3 starsOverall: 3 starsOf the trilogy, this book is my least favorite of the three."
1,Yuk Yuk Yuk: A Parable for the Masses or Condecension?,"While ""The Celestine Prophecy"" struck the imagination and ingnited the dormant spirits of millions, ""The Tenth Insight"" (also known by me as ""The Cure For Insomnia"") condecends its readers with its high school reading level prose and thoroughly untenable unfolding events. Redfield stretches the concept of ""suspension of disbelief"" beyond the acceptable level. He couldn't even ""suspend the incredulous"" in this one. I was moved by the spiritual message of ""The Celestine Prophecy"" and would have once again tolerated Redfield's sophmoric writing style had he risen the story even slightly above the genre of really bad science fiction. 'Twas a painful read"
2,Reader From Reading PA,"I just could not get into this book, like his others, it just went all over the place and really did not capture my interest as the other 9 insights he wrote about. I read almost all of the book but very rough to get into and get through for me anyway."
2,"Not so much ""An Adventure"" after all","An interesting case of ""airport religion."" Pick this one up at the gift shop and, an hour later, you'll just be dying to tell everyone else on your flight all about the Insights... unless, of course, you recognize the fallacy of appealing to a reader's inherent intelligence and worth by dumbing the text waaaaay down. Two stars only for narrowly beating out the in-flight magazine."
1,More garbage,"More horribly written nonsense from the very worst of the utterly self-absorbed, opportunistic, '90s, ""new age"" profiteering quacks."
2,completists only - the DVD is way better,"Last week I downloaded 12 Robyn Hitchcock concerts. This album is better than some and not as good as others. I love the video, but without the visuals, it's just a middling Robyn concert.I needed this for the three (3) non-DVD cuts ""Where Do You Go When You Die"", ""The Wind Cries Mary"" and ""Beautiful Queen"". None of them are great. If you're new to Hitchcock, rent the DVD or get (the reasonably priced, sonicly pleasing) Jewels For Sophia instead."
1,pretentious and overdone,"I picked up this CD on a whim,and I'll never do that again. The music is tired, the lyrics are incredibly pretentious and trite. Like a early 80s nightmare. What happened to Jonathan Demme's taste? His soundtracks have always been great, but give this one a wide berth. I want my money back."
4,Keeps butter fresh,We had a ceramic butter dish that broke and I had searched every where for a replacement. This is a very nice replacement for the broken one. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because the handle on the lid is a little small and makes it a little harder to get it off. We love butter on toasst in the morning and butter from the fridge is to hard to spread. We leave this dish filled with butter on the counter and it keeps it soft and fresh. I am very happy with this product.
3,Not practical for use,"Pretty nough piece,but handle on lid is not enough to grab ahold of. Needless to say,I dropped my lid within 2 weeks and broke it."
5,Off The Hook,"In 1994, when St. John first arrived at what was then Wild 107.7, the stations format consisted mostly of Old School, Hip Hop and FreeStyle records. Ready for a new direction and recognizing the importance of dance music in the Bay Area, St. John pushed for a more progressive and edgier dance sound. Finally with consistency and hard work, Wild 107 aired Nocturnal Transmissions' in 1994, the Bay Area's first house show in more than 3 years. This show was hosted by St. John, and featured local resident club DJs. As the Bay Area grew more accustomed to the house sound 'Nocturnal Transmissions' evolved into 'St. John's Playhouse', where St. John teamed up with David Garcia to bring ground breaking records. As the Bay Area's mainstream audience became more aware and began to accept an underground sound, 'St. John's Playhouse' became 'House Nation'. A show that caters to the global house sound and it's culture. 'House Nation' brings you cutting edge dance music.This CD is House To The Fullest"
4,creepy book,"I liked this book but it was pretty creepy. Not one of her best books, but I'd say within the top 20 books."
2,My very least favorite Nora Roberts Book,"I waited a long time to review this book. I didn't really like this book.I can usually say that even Nora Roberts weakest books are better than some of the better books of other authors. However, I was very dissapointed with this book. I found it to be very depressing. I had a hard time reading it and almost put it down without finishing it.I am sure that there others who will disagree with me. I just found that this book was just a bit too much on the dark side for me."
1,Only Nora Roberts I did not like.,"This is the only Nora Roberts book that I have actively disliked. I hated the ending. For me if a book about good and evil ends without evil being defeated then it is a very lousy book. I read romance so I can feel good when I close the book. When I closed this one good was definitely not what I was feeling. Yes the smaller evil was defeated, but the greater evil survived and the book's heroes were left ignorant of that fact. Hated the ending."
3,Could be better,"I rated this three stars. Not because of the author but because of the manner it was changed to an e-book. Once again, as with many other e-books, I find misspellings, multiple careless running together of paragraphs that are confusing and difficult to read, bad or incorrect punctuation, all of which makes this a poor read. Amazon could and should do much better than this. Perhaps it is the publisher, but who ever is at fault, Amazon is getting a bad rep from this."
2,Disappointed in this graphic portrayal of satanism,"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan and eagerly await each of her books. However, I was extremely disappointed in this book. The love story was secondary to the primary focus on death, graphic violence, senseless murders, and satanic ritual. The characters of Clare and Cam were never fully developed. The purpose of the Ernie character was predictable from the very beginning.I much prefer Nora's ""lighter"" treatments of witchcraft, as depicted in the Three Sisters Trilogoy. Even the sometimes too realistic Eve Dallas stories pale in comparison to this book. A true disappointment."
5,One of Nora Robert's best!!,"This book kept me on the edge of my seat. As usual, Nora makes you feel like you know the characters and are a part of this small town. I really had a hard time putting this one down. If you enjoy suspense, and a thriller, you'll love this book."
1,Disturbing book,"I honestly had to look twice to make sure this was a Nora Roberts book. I have been reading her books for years but this in one I cannot finish. It's way too graphic and not a romance at all. If I had wanted to read a cult book, I would have looked in that section in the bookstore. I'm very disappointed in this book but I will keep reading Nora Roberts."
3,Good and Bad.,"I thought the book was pretty good, but there was so many holes that you kinda wanted to go to the end and re-write it yourself. I HATED the ending. Not typical Nora Roberts."
1,Nora Roberts at her worst!,I love Nora Roberts' books and I think I have read every one of them at least once. I usually cannot put them down once I start reading them. This book was full of darkness and evil and definitely not in the same category as her other books. I hope Nora Roberts stays with flesh and blood characters and out of the occult and demonic from now on! This book's look into the supernatural was very disturbing and I actually did not even like having it in my house. It did not go on the shelf to be read again and again as most of her books have done.
1,More graphic violence than love scenes.,"This was a tremendous disappointment to a Nora Roberts fan since Irish Thoroughbred. There was no need at all for any of the dreadfully graphic brutality. Friends who are also Nora Roberts fans feel the same way. If it were possible, I'd want my money back."
3,WOW!,"This book was amazing, it had an idea surrounded by intrigue, power, greed, destruction...but ultimately love. It nailed it, and the ending was totally unexpected. WOW. 5 Stars"
4,Devine evil,I enjoy books that are suspenseful.I have never read anything about the cult and the dark places some people choose to go.It makes me more aware that it does exist. But I'm really glad this had a happy ending
2,NOT A ROMANCE!!,"I would actually give this book two different ratings as a horror/suspense a 4. As a romance a 1.This book should NEVER be categorized as a romance. One problem with this book is that I wanted to read a character driven romance and ended up with a Stephen King horror. I also felt that this book ended abruptly, there was no closure. How did the town feel afterward, what happened to the cult worshipers, etc.This book was difficult and disturbing read. I don't recommend that you read it before bedtime. I generally am not that disturbed by what I read, but I definately did not sleep well the night I finished this book.Be warned not your typical Nora Roberts romance. If you are bothered by the occult and graphic violence pass this by."
4,I really liked this book!,"This is one of the few ""romance"" type books I have read. I really enjoyed it, it kept me interested throughout the story. The characters were pretty likable, but I would have enjoyed more development in that area. The ending was a COMPLETE SURPRISE!! I did not see it coming! I have purchased Montana Sky and Sanctuary for future reading. Being from Maryland, I had heard about Nora Roberts, but had never read her. I think I was missing something, to be honest. I recommend this to anyone wanting a diversion, a little bit scary, with some romantic suspense. A winner! I also recommend the wonderful Barbara Michaels, and Kay Hooper.Kathleen"
1,Get This Book Out of My House!,"I have been reading Nora Roberts for years now, and I came across ""Divine Evil"" for the first time last week. The subject matter seemed to be just like many of Roberts' novels, with a tale of romance intertwined with a tale of trial, heartbreak and action. Only, once I got into this book, my opinion changed. All in all, this book creeped me out. I don't know if Roberts was going through some cult phase or whatever, but this book was certainly not like any of the others she has written. If you are a person who is not bothered when reading about sexual rites and animal sacrifices, then go ahead and read it. Otherwise, stick to Roberts softer stuff."
1,Too Graphic!!!!,"Normally I love Nora Roberts, but this time the graphic violence and demonic worship went too far. I'm not into censorship and normally have a strong stomach but there were pages I had to skip over because it was just too much! I hate reading about this sort of thing in the paper let alone in something I am reading for entertainment. I would not reccomend this book to anyone. Normally I buy Nora's books and circulate them to my friends and family but this one I had to throw away. It just felt too evil. I didn't even want it around. I am not saying ban the book or anything, but be aware before you read it that it isn't Nora's typical style."
3,This book is just too graphically demonic!,"I felt that Nora was experimenting with her audience to see how much horror they could absorb. I did not like the fact that there was no ""good vs. evil"" in the traditional sense. The whole town was caught up in the corruptive power of the devil (evil) without there being any religious intervention (good). Where were the church leaders? Every town has at least one. Although Nora's writing is hard to put down (as usual), I would not recommend this book (especially as a bedtime read)."
3,This book was more of the occult than romance or mystery.,"After reading Brown's trilogy Born In ..., I looked forward to Divine Secrets. The good news was that I couldn't put it down. The bad news is that the horribly occultic nature of the plot gave me nightmares! I sound like goody-2-shoes but the book could have done with at least a mention of the attempt of an intervention by a priest, rabbi or minister. I tossed it into trash, but will order her next trilogy poste-haste!"
1,Trash,"This is the worst Nora Roberts book I have ever read. Pure trash. No real plot, satan worship, and what romance there is in the book is unrealistic. Real waste of my money, and a bigger waste of my time. I have read every book Nora Roberts has written and I own most of them, but this is just ... awful."
5,Thanks for the Great Book,The book I ordered arrived in great shape and quicker than I expected - I'm looking forward to sitting down to enjoy reading it...
1,First Nora Roberts I have ever not finished,"This is the very first Nora Roberts book I could not be bothered to finish and I put it down after page 89. I have read aout 90% of her books even the JD Robb ones, but this one was terrible. I loved her books about he Concannons, the Quinn brothers and so many more but lately it seems that lots of her books are about women/children being raped and I must say it sickens me some, also I am getting a bit tired of all the demons, satanism etc scenarios. So no, all in all, not worth buying."
1,This book made me stupider,"I love genre fiction, but I usually avoid the Romance genre because of its cliches. Maybe Nora Roberts fans will like this book. John Saul fans might also like it. Personally, I found everything about it to be simplistic and downright idiotic.The bad guys--Satan worshippers--fill every cliche and leave nothing original. They even call for Jesus when they die from stupidity. The main character, Clare, is a modest, rich, supermodel artist. Very realistic. The love interest, Cam, is a modest, rich, supermodel sheriff. Uh huh. Their chemistry together is a series of cliches taken from 80s movies. You know, I'm all for a dash of romance in a book, but please make it believable. I feel as if Nora Roberts is following a formula that made her successful long ago, in the 1970s or 80s, and no longer works for people who pay attention to modern TV, film, and books."
1,Too disturbing for me,"I am a big fan of Nora Roberts' books, but this one disturbed me too much. I keep all of her books once I read them, but this one I couldn't get out of the house fast enough. Even though I read this book when it first came out a few years ago, I still get uncomfortable thinking about it. Although some of the things in the book are not beyond the realm of possibility, I really don't want to read about them, especially in such graphic detail. It definitely is not her best work."
3,Need more advance info,"I do like the singers. However, if I had known what songs were included, I probably would have selected something different."
1,Unsatisfied,Since I did not receive my vidio from nothingbutnet or homefortheholidays nor did I receive any answer to my inquires I cannot review the product only the seller and Amazon.com.I would have the rate the seller a zero and Amazon.com a ten on a scale of 1 to 10 because Amazon.com did guarante my purchase and I got my money back.
5,Great Filter + Great Price,The Fram Filter is a great item and the price was verygood. Beats the Auto Supply Houses here.Amazon is the greatest...........
5,Riding for Success : Both In and Out of the Show Ring,"This book could be considered a ""manual"" for someone wanting to learn to ride Saddle Seat correctly, in its true art form. This book also covers many aspects of being a good horseman and the skills it passes are all generally applicable to all horses and styles of riding. This book is one of only 4 books that I highly recommend to my students."
4,Not too shabby,"The build of the pistol itself is rather good. However, the mock silencer is a joke. It doesn't fit tight and just kinda wobbles when you point the gun which can throw off your shots."
4,Nice but a little bulky,"The box is nice but it's a little larger than I expected. I suppose I didn't pay close enough attention to the dimensions. It'll take quite a while before I can even come close to filling it with enough recipes cards that they all stand up and not fall over in the box. The box does look nice though, it's good quality, and if you have a ton of recipes... I'd recommend it."
4,The reality of a saint,"At first blush, this book is a difficult read. The inclusion of commentary by the author had you jumping across the page. After adjusting to this style, you start seeing the real Hildegard. There is much to learn from these writings, the pains, trials and thoughts help to realize the difficulty of Hildegard's path. This seems to be a common message as you look at the lives of all the saints and martyrs of the early church. Nothing worthwhile comes easy. I would reccomend getting this book!"
5,Dictionnaire Gastronomique,"My only regret about this book is that I did not take a suitcase full to Paris with me. In every restaurant in which I used the book, my waiter, or the maitre d', or both were soon looking over my shoulder to ask about it. I could have traded a copy for every mealThe book was written (and is published) in France for the French restaurateur who speaks no English but wishes to translates his menu for the Brits and Americans. It is very thorough, offering generally very good definitions of hundreds upon hundreds of preparations. Once in a while the idom is a bit off, but the book never let me down. With it, we ate very well indeed."
1,Too heavy to carry in a purse,"The good news: lots of French food words, alphabetically arranged.The bad news: much too large and heavy to carry in a purse to restaurants. It is 8.25"" tall, 5.75"" wide and over 1"" thick. This is bigger than a paperback and too big and heavy to carry to a nice restaurant. So far, the lightest weight book that I can find is the Marling Menu-Master for France, 6"" tall, 4 "" wide and very lightweight paper. I don't like its organization, but I can carry it with me all day without hurting my neck or needing to carry a large purse/backpack.If I carried a backpack, which I do not and will not, then this could come with me.This book is being sent back to Amazon.com."
4,Very Interesting,"I really like te Eddie Dickens trilogy. They are fun books to read because of how they are writen. The author knows how to keep someone interested in the book. During the book he will talk to you like he is telling you a story face to face. It is a fun way to read a book. What makes it even better are the characters. Eddie who is very young is like the adult to all the grown ups. He has to tell them what to do and get them out of trouble. With all of his different adventures he goes on, it makes it hard to put it down because you want to see what Eddie will do next."
4,The mouse pictured is not what you get,"I already use this mouse with my laptop, and I want another for my desktop. I love the ergonomic feel of it in my small hand. It's a perfect fit, with the curved inner side making an ideal thumb rest. However, what you receive when you order this mouse is not the one in the photo. The new version is a squat, uniformly roundish shape like most ambidextrous mice these days, with the buttons placed differently also. I didn't even open the package as I'm going to send it back and see if I can find the pictured mouse some place else.Amazon: it would help if you updated the photo when the product changes."
5,"Great CD, but a Parental Advisory?","Amazingly good cd... the best song is definatly ""Banquet"" but""Like Eating Glass is definatly a close second. I highly reccomend it. However, I do not understand the PA on this album i think there is only one 'f' bomb on the whole cd???? GREAT CD PICK IT UP!"
3,Gimmicky,"I was bowled over the first time I heard ""Banquet"" and really wanted to like the rest of this album, but I just can't get into it. The band is clearly talented, but they can't seem to let their songs breathe. Every stray second is filled with some treated vocal sample, buzzing synth part, or weird guitar overdub that doesn't fit in. It comes off as cluttered and gimmicky. And Kele Okereke's yelping, bracing in small doses, gets tiresome over the course of a whole album."
3,OK Corporate Alterna-Punk,"The Ex+TheFall+Television+Gang of Four+Joy Division=A great band? No, it equals something that might've been semi-revolutionary 20 years ago, but is basically contrived and without value here in the future...2005. That's right- it's 2005, and you can play music like this, fine, but don't pretend it's revolutionary(!). Musically, it's reactionary, taking me back to my childhood. Check the new Steve Malkmus if you want to hear some real risk-taking. Or Clinic! Way more brilliant! This Bloc Party isn't bad, it's just so average."
5,it's like the Clash meets Blur,"A new fresh band right from the UK. This album is well written and unbelievably catchy. It's got the layout like a Clash song and spoken like Blur. A very promising start for this new group. Quite possibly the album of 2005, well, so far."
3,3-1/2 stars -- Indie rock lives on...,"I never heard of Bloc Party until I came onto this site. But since I'm a big fan of indie rock, I found their album Silent Alarm and decided to give it a listen.There are a lot of mixed reviews for this album: some people say the band is right up there with the Killers, while other people say they're nothing but Gang of Four rip-offs. I don't agree with either one of those inferences; I say they're somewhere in the middle. And speaking of in the middle, that's exactly where you'll find the best songs; particularly ""She's Hearing Voices"", ""This Modern Love"" and ""Pioneers"".The rest of the songs aren't exactly bad, but they really don't do anything to make the band different from any other indie rock collective like, say, Kaiser Chiefs. But Silent Alarm is still above-average, so if you like indie rock like I do, feel free to pick it up.Anthony Rupert"
1,should have listened harder before buying,"I don't like this cd at all. Too much rock. All the hype about this record raises much suspicion. Get Munk's ""Aperitivo"" instead."
5,AWESOME,"This album rocks - buy it now. High-energy Brit post-punk/pop. I saw Bloc Party at ACL Festival in Sep. 2005 and they were incredible - one of the highlights of the festival. Every song on the album rocks. My favorites are ""So Here We Are""(""I figured it out!!""), and ""Positive Tension"", but as I said, every song is great. If I had to guess which bands Bloc Party was most influenced by, I'd say The Cure."
3,Mediocrity at its very best,"Silent Alarm will not blow you away, though it may satisfy your appetite for easily digestible teen-leaning post-punkness.2 parts cheesy and predictable, 3 parts refined and fetching. Aside from ""Banquet"", theres nothing gourmet here, just a well baked cup cake."
3,as good as pitchfork sayeth? nay.,"Good listen, better than other records but I dunno, it was just lacking something, perhaps it sounded too familiar. Brought to mind Fugazi minus hardcore-ness and polished a little more. Its still making its rotation thru my stereo blender so maybe it will get better with listening. Not gonna put money on that though."
4,good but could have done better,"first off, why did they re-record banquet!? the version on their EP is way better! i was listening to this cd for about a 4 days when the song positive tension was being played on THE OC! what the hell!? why? yuck.... it was being played at a trendy fake party with a bunch of dumb bitches dancing to it. i have lost respect for them..."
5,One of my favorites,"Excellent CD. It's one of very few that doesn't make me feel like I've been ripped off, and even more of a rarity, I really like every song."
4,I'm Gonna Use My Teeth And My Clothes.,"Bloc Party is one of the more promising new nu wave bands to come out of Britain. Along with The Music, they forge a more original approach to the old genre. ""Like Eating Glass"", ""Helicopter"", ""Positive Tension"", ""Banquet"" and ""Price Of Gas"" all have great beats and could easily be alternative top hits. The only drawbacks to ""Silent Alarm"" are that it is 14 songs, just a touch too long, and also slightly too repetitive. However, had the band shaved it down to 10 tracks, I believe this would have garnered five stars. Less is more gentlemen, less is more. I didn't particularly enjoy ""She's Hearing Voices"", ""Pioneers"", ""Luno"" and ""Plans"". However, for a debut, this band knows what they're doing and have a strong sense of what musical direction they're taking. At such a low price, this cd is a steal, and I recommend anyone interested in punk/new wave to check this out."
2,another one,"I honestly don't think this album is anything special. It has some good musical elements and a fun, energetic overall sound, but that description can fit most bands. They sound alot like Franz-Ferdinand and a handful of other bands. I think they are pretty good myself; I just wish they had tried harder to distinguish themselves from everyone else.The brit critics overrated this album. Americans seem to really admire pretty much anything that comes out of Great Britain musically, so of course once the album was released here it became something you can find for sale at hollister. Don't get Silent Alarm unless you don't really have any idea what's been going on in the music scene in the last decade. Then you might actually like it."
2,The most Overrated Band Ever,"When there's about 8 copies of a CD for sale at your local used CD shop, there's a reason. After 3 or 4 listens this CD will be collecting dust.Don't get me wrong, Banquet and Helicopter are catchy and fun. But taking over the US, I hope, takes more than 2 catchy singles.If you want some really good Brit music with a dancy feel pick up Hard-Fi's ""Stars of CCTV"" or Kasabian's ""Kasabian."""
2,over-rated,"Like a lot of bands this year, espesially UK indie bands, these guys are getting over-rated to an alarming degree. Take a listen to a band like Wire from the 70s then come back and tell me Bloc Party or Hard Fi are anything special, they just arent. With a bit of work they might develope into something half decent but their music is below average by my definition."
5,Great mix of genre s/p 80s New Wave,"If you like punk, and dance, but haven't heard them mixed without the hip hop overtones, then you need to hear this. This album is one of my favorite albums from the past year, on par with Arcade Fire, Broken Social scene, and definitely better than Franz Ferdinand or The Killers.The songs are complicated in that they do not follow standard chord progressions like much of modern music, and instead use excited, punk paced, jangling telecasters to punch out single notes and high sounding power chords. They are great with delay as well, and when the two guitarists move away from the harmony, the bassist keeps the music infused and alive until they return.I love the music the most. Politically I am conservative, and american, but I love the music so much that I turn the other cheek for the Bush bashing, and disagreement with red state philosophy.Seriously, buy this album if you like music that you can bike, work out, drive, or dance to."
3,"critics have over-hyped them, but still solid band","Calling them brilliant is a massive overstatement but there is a lot of talent here. The tracks greatly benefit from a fine studio production. There's REALLY great drumming that makes all of the tracks dynamic and energetic. The only real weakness is the singer, who has a great knack for vocal-phrasing but his high-pitched reedy voice just doesn't quite work in some of the tracks. I suspect he sounds even worse live."
5,On to something big,"A disclaimer: I guess part of the reason I'm such a big fan of this album is that I was oblivious to much of the pre-release hype (apparently I live under some sort of large rock) before listening to the album for myself.Once I did, I was hooked. Contrary to some of the other reviewers' opinions, I found the songs catchy and instantly alluring. Listening repeatedly just affirmed these views...Bloc Party's music is interesting, intelligent, and a refreshing departure from current big name bands (if I could listen to the radio for a day and not hear Nickelback, I'd die a happy woman).As a side note, I was able to see Bloc Party live this fall and it was an incredible performance--totally high energy and addictive!I can't wait for their sophomore effort...or for them to tour again!"
3,Not Greene's best work,"I have enjoyed a number of Greene's novels, but was disappointed with Orient Express. For a better read and more compelling characters, I recommend Greene's later work including The Quite American, The Comedians or even The Heart of the Matter."
4,Read It!,"No, this is not the Agatha Christie mystery :). It's an absorbing semi-political thriller by Graham Greene, with great characters and a compelling plot. Read it!"
2,bland and pointless,"The story of a bunch of people taking the Orient Express to Istanbul. One of them is a rich Jew and he has an affair with a poor dancer on the train, and almost falls in love with her.Greene writes well enough to carry you along, but I was let down by the blah way in which the story ended. It felt like going along with someone who promises to take you to an interesting bar, only to discover that the bar is smelly and full of old drunks. Perhaps that is a requirement of making a story 'realistic' and thus literary, as opposed to a schmaltzy, feel-good Hollywood finish... but the the ending, in which the Jew goes for the beautiful, empty, vacuous girl and forgets all about the little dancer with nothing more than a slight shrug made me want to shrug off this story as well."
5,the REAL L.O.L.,Good Music still exists. Waitin on the Lost & Found CD to drop by L.O.L. the follow-up classics to Heaven or Hell album.
5,mest strikes again,I enjoyed this album because it has all the best of mest. shows their mature side with catchy tunes to keep jumping and dancing.
5,could it get any better?,"You heard 'Cadillac' from 'Destination Unknown' and got hooked. You heard Good Charlotte's Benji sing along to 'Jaded' from 'MEST' and got addicted. Well what better way to ease the withdrawls than some more MEST? With great hits like 'Take Me Away' and 'Kiss Me, Kill Me', you wont be disappointed with 'Photographs.' They spent a good two years making this album perfect, and they did a damn fine job."
3,This is everything but mest,"What the hell!!! My friend bought me this album for my birthday and it looked to be a darker and more mature Mest. I put it in my stereo and this is not Mest they have turned pop as hell! Mest is the band that wrote ""Drawing Board"" ""Cadillac"" and ""Breaking Down"", this is a new Mest trying to make it to the MTV mainstream, if you thought the old Mest were too punk then you will definitely like this album, but if you're a big Mest fan then i suggest you make your way across the cd shop and go check out Cauterize or Saves The Day"
2,punk bands continue to go down hill,"I've listen to Mest for years. They've never really let down on any of their albums.......... until now. This album is bad, but it does have a couple good songs on it. This album sounds alot like another punk band called goldfinger. SURPRISINGLY, the producer of this new Mest album (Photographs) is the lead singer of goldfinger. Wonder why they sound like them now. John Feldman is the singer of goldfinger and has produced all of Mest's albums. Their first two record label releases were great, but things started going down hill with there third and now the fourth is just bad. They need a new producer ASAP. I blame John Feldman for this disapointing goldfinger album, sorry I meant disapointing Mest album. There a talented band in need of a new fantastic producer. Please send your Resume's to Mest as soon as you can."
5,AMAZING,"this cd is just amazing, i love mest, so i have all there cds, and this one is another awesome, even alittle darker, but i still love it. MEST inspires me so much!!!!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST BANDS EVER!!!!!!,"I totally agree with the MELISSA/AKA/MEL with this. Mest do get better and better as they go on!!! they are amazing!!! CURSED is the best song jeremiah has ever written!! i still prefer tonys voice, but jeremiahs best work is on PHOTOGRAPHS!! i hope they carry on getting better and better as they go on!! i'm sure this wont be the last album from mest!!! there are so many boring bands out there that are famous and they don't deserve it!!! like the TRANSPLANTS for example! travis is a good drummer, but tim couldn't sing to save his life!!! Mest deserve to be famous because they are so damn good!! one more thing, why the hell do the japanese get a bonus track and we don't?!!! they dont understand it anyway, so what is the point??! GREAT ALBUM!! IF YOU DON'T BUY IT, YOU ARE A MORON!!!!!!"
4,Fabulous Stuff from Hometown Heros,"Just a few years ago Fall Out Boy were OPENING for this band kids.The new album is a depart from the old but great in it's own new way. 'Take Me Away(Cried Out to Heaven)' is a new Mest anthem,'Photographs' will take you through all of your own personal memories lost in pictures, 'Can't Take This' is a heartfelt ode and if you have ever experienced a hardship you'll be able to feel the emotion, 'Tonight Will Last Forever' is just a great song and it doesn't allow the album to leave the city of Chicago behind, and 'Last Kiss' will get jammed into your head.Check it out, keep listening to it, and I promise you, it will not dissapoint. Especially if you're a real fan and enjoy honest music."
5,I'm liking It,This album is different from Mest's earlier stuff. It's not as fun and happy as Wasting Time or Destination Unknown but i think it rocks! Mest is a great band that tries new things and makes it work. This is definitely a good cd to buy and listen over and over.
3,Happiness Declines,"The first track on this album is stellar, ska influenced with a blast of good ol pop-punk once in a while to keep you on your feet. Then Mest does what every other band like them has done in the past...attempt to descend into the ""dark world"" that we are apparently living in. Seven or eight tracks later they recover, and put out a few good songs that are worth a listen. They also incorporate somewhat of an 80s influence through out the album."
4,They've come a long way...,"I've been a MEST fan for 2 years now, fell in love with em the first time I saw em live at a Good Charlotte concert. I have all the cds and I have to say that this one is different from the rest. It seems that the guys have grown up a little and are showing a more serious side. All the songs are amazing!However if you're not really into the heavy emotional sound that somes bands have, you might think twice about getting this cd. But if you're a true MEST fan, no matter have long you've been one, you'll see that this disc is pure genius and a fantasic addtion to any cd collection"
5,ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING,"I have been listening to Mest since the year 2000, I own every other MEST cd to date and have not been disapointed by one yet.The new album PHOTOGRAPHS is a different swing for MEST from there previous albums. The new release dives into much deeper issues and sounds like it is comming straight from the heart.The entire album is breath taking, every single song different but great in its own sense, catchy guitar riffs, hard singing, soft singing and harmonys like no others. This album is one that stands out and will be remembered for a long time to come. Absolutely amazing.-Davo"
2,I love MEST...until now,"What HAPPENED!!! I have every MEST CD and love them. They are punky, poppy and have a warped sense of humor. This CD is whining and sadness songs with boring melodic pith. Several songs are about ""Goodbye"", ""Last Goodbye"", ""Sad Goodbye"", and then 2 songs with ""Nightmare"", ""this Nightmare"" blah, blah, blah. I kept advancing the CD and waiting for the fun and humorous punk songs and...........NOTHING! BOOOOOOOORRRRING. Last MEST album I will ever buy. Sad to day."
4,Another good cd by MEST!,"Ok, so alot of people have said that after their second album, MEST went downhill and stopped making good punk music. I have to disagree, Their style has definitely changed but I don't think its a bad thing. They have just matured and so has their music. This new cd, photographs, is alot less punk then their earlier stuff but it is still a great cd. ""Can't take this"" is a really cool song. So, you might not like this cd if you are really into the old school mest like hotel room and songs like that but it def is a good cd you should get."
5,MEST AWESOME!!,"YES I WENT TO THE MEST CONCERT ON OCT 17,2005 IN CHICAGO AT THE VIC THEATRE!!!! THEY SANG SOME OF THERE NEW SONGS!!! US CHICAGOANS GOT THE CD BEFORE ANYONE ELSE HAHA! AND WE GOT OUR CD AUTOGRAPHED YEAH!!!! WELL YOU SHOULD REALLLLLLLYYY GO OUT AND BUY THIS CD IT'S REALLY AN AWESOME CD TO HAVE FOR YOUR COLLECTION OF AWESOME BANDS"
2,Growing up and giving in,"Mest is one of my favorite bands, in fact, the more I think about it, they are my favorite band. They've been with me for years, so please believe me when I say that I'm cutting them as much slack as one can in this review.Why is it that when bands ""grow up"", they appeal to the younger audience of teenie boppers? It seems that the longer a band is around, the poppier their sound becomes. It happened with Green Day, it happened with Blink 182, and now it's happening to Mest.Photographs was a disappointment to me. If you're a real fan, pretend this CD never came out. It will upset you. This isn't the Mest we know and love. Sure, the CD would be wonderful if it was someone else, but when you have all the previous CDs, Photographs is nothing in comparison.However, if you're new to Mest, and if you're thirteen or fourteen, go ahead. Knock yourselves out."
2,vailtrail.com/ weekly shuffle/ CD Review by Samantha Donen,"Mest, PhotographsI had mixed feelings about Mest's album Photographs. The catchy lyrics got me singing along to songs I had never heard before, while the alternative pop beats reminded me of bands like Blink 182 and the Deftones. Yet, the overplayed tortured and lonely theme, that of photographs from an ending relationship, grew tiresome. By the time I got to the title track, I just wanted the album to end. VT"
2,Are you kidding?,"I simply can't believe that the band who wrote ""drawing board"", ""cadillac"" and the entire s/t punk masterpiece of 2003 could be behind this crap, but they are. ""photographs"" is a complete 180 from past mest releases, and I for one plan to never buy a mest record or go to a mest show again. Bands who change so much shouldn't even continue under their old name. Change the sound? Change the name. Simple as that."
2,Mediocrity takes over,"If you are a fan of Mest's older cd's the I would suggest not getting this one. There are no fast songs. This doesn't even sound like mest. I didn't like the first few songs I heard on myspace and initially didn't want to get this cd, then I gave in and got it anyway. It's really not that good, I promise. I hope they get some life back before they record again."
3,Comes in Handy,I used the book quite a bit when I first began writing performance appraisals. I liked how it is was divided into categories. I did used several of the phrases as starting points when writing and tweeked them to fit the employee.
4,Essential guide for written performance appraisals,"""Effective Phrases for Performance Appraisals"" is the equivalent of a ""Roget's Thesaurus"" for supervisors and managers who have to evaluate employee performance on a regular basis. It organizes effective phrases under headings such as 'Communicative Skills"" and ""Leadership"". You pick the most appropriate phrase to describe your employee's performance, e.g. ""optimally utilizes all channels of communications"", and write the review. Even if you don't want to use phrases out of this book, I've found that it is a good pattern book for brainstorming my own phrases.The only omission (in my opinion) in ""Effective Phrases for Performance Appraisals"" is the lack of phrases for below average performance. Try ""The Definitive Performance Writing Guide"" by Douglas L. Drewry for your below average performance appraisals."
5,HR Director gives high marks,"After having used this book for the last 6 years in writing reviews and consulting with hundreds of managers performing this task - this tool is the most effective guide around. It is concise, easy to use and full of bright ideas. I'm ordering the 10th edition for all my managers and know it will be much appreciated! I tell them it's the book with all the answers. When needing to give feedback on developmental opportunities the guide can be used on both sides of the fence - these are often the tough messages that managers struggle with - the guide makes it easy."
5,One of the most helpful tools I've found for evaluations.,I have written evaluations for employees in the past and most recently for students. I have never found any resource as handy as this one. It is full of phrases that can be adapted for almost any situation and/or personality. I use it for clinical evaluations of students in work settings as well as for letter of recommendations. It also comes in handy when I want to be particularly accurate on a college/scholarship application for a student. These recommendations are especially important to a student's future. I have received compliments on my letter writing skills from other faculty members. I really can't take the credit...it belongs to Mr. Neal. Thanks!
2,Low Effective Rating on this one,"I have yet to use an actual phrase from this guide, but... it is good for re-charging my batteries when I have to write a review and feel uninspired. After reading through some ideas in this guide, I usually find I can then find my own words to say what I need to convey. The fact that all the phrases are positive, I see as a good thing because I feel it's important to have a positive attitude toward the associate you're reviewing. If there are challenges in the persons performance, the manager should have been working with the associate on that throughout the review period. I would recommend this book but only as a way to inspire the person writing a review to come up with their own way of phrasing... rather than use the phrases in the book. The people we manage deserve more than ""copy/paste"" reviews."
4,Effective Phrases - Effective book,"Great little book full of phrases and words to give your staff the best appraisal to make them stand out from the crowd when it comes to bonus reviews or promotion boards. If you have to write more than a couple of appraisals each year, then this has got to be your bible."
5,Awesome! Reviews done quickly!,This is a terrific resource--I finished my performance reviews in half the time!
2,For Good Appraisals only,"This book does not provide effective phrases for reviews that are less than satisfactory. The subtitle should be ""A guide to Evaluations for Successful employees"" not ""A guide to Successful Evaluations"". Considering that the hardest phrases to develop are those not meeting expectations, this book really does not provide much benefit."
5,GREAT BOOK,This is a great book to have lying around. It is very useful in writing great reviews of others and for using to write appraisals about yourself. This is money well spent and will be a book that will last years to come.
4,A Thesaurus for Personnel Reviews,"My management motto is ""Maximize strengths/minimize weaknesses"". With this book, you can really pinpoint your employees' strengths and use just the right phrase to add that special touch to the evaluation. I gave a copy to each of my department heads to help them say just the right thing to their staffs. A real plus if you are serious about getting the most from an employee evaluation."
2,Not much here,"I found little of value in this video. The information is rather scanty and the style is somewhat insulting to the intelligence. It tries to be cute, but it ends up being silly and not too helpful.I would not recommend that anyone spend money on this video, but if you have a chance to view it free (I borrowed my copy from the library) then it does offer some input regarding a few common questions of pregnancy. However, a better source would be just about any pregnancy book, or simply the woman's doctor/midwife."
5,hard to remove,these clips are hard to get on and off at first but are tough hold body down no matter how hard you crash
5,HOT FREESTYLE AT ITS BEST,"i bought this album and its the best freestyle music i have ever heard, a must for all freestyle and dance fanatics."
3,"Britney may suck, me....thinks this is alrite album","This album is okay. Has some interesting club beats, and a couple nice up tempo tracks. Nothing substantive or revolutionary, but you wouldn't expect that from Ms. Spears. Her vocals will never be that great. The rancor of her in-your-face...faux-liberating-fem exhibitionism can be criticized from an intellectual standpoint, but it fits with the pace of most of this album. As for the exhibitionism from a male standpoint: Britney, less is more! Take that anyway you like."
4,well....i don't know about this one,"This cd is great to dance to, but there is just so much of the same beat and themes. I wish that Britney could have talked about things other than sex. She is such a huge role model that when all she talks about is sex and breakups, it kind of sends out the wrong message... so, for some, the record is a good time, but for others, I would pick something else like india. arie, or eamon, or even missy elliot. It's your call...."
5,Britney goes Hip to da Hop,"Heck I would like to say that this Album is just Hip to the bomb I mean (I Got That) Boom Boom Ft Ying Yang Twins is a tight song has the good beat and the singing and everything just sounds real cool. The whole album aint all about love which I like 'cause I'm not into all that love song type of stuff. And I'm a big fan of Rap, R&b and stuff like that but when I heard this cd just hit the spot with the beats my ears were hooked till the whole cd was through with...Specially with the Madonna feature on there also a good remix at the end so check it out if you love the hip hop beats cause for sure you'll get what you bought, and not another one to waste money on."
4,Maybe her Best Album,"I think this album may be her best...I feel she has gotten out of singing the bubblegum pop song and doing different kind of stuff, she adds rap in Boom Boom with the Ying Yang twins and a little techno even...i love this cd, Toxic is definitly the best song on this album, it has a cool beat with a sexy attiude, it has to be my favorite cd of hers...definitly a good buy, even if you're not a big britney fan!"
4,I tried to hold back,I broke down and decided to give her CD a chance. I loved the earlier ones but wasn't sure of her new edgier move. I was wrong! Very ... and smooth... ....! I do agree that it really isn't for the younger crowd but you have to understand that Britney has stated she is trying to reach the older audience now. Sorry young girls Britney's growing up! Breathe on Me...You done good with that one Britney! Be proud of this CD it's great!
3,Its okay but it could have been better,"This is her fourth album but instead of getting better shes getting worse. Of course their are some songs that are great like all the singles of this album (Me Against the Music, Toxic, Everytime and Outrageous) but comparing to the old Britney, she was better before, now she does not even sing like she used to. It is a good album but not her best."
1,This is just sad!,"Britney Spears is a horrendus attempt at a musician. She doesn't write her own music and she has a terrible voice. The only reason any guys would like her is because she has got a hot body. That is the point of all her videos. Her PLASTIC body. Anyway, this stuff stinks and if you want to stay sane, then don't buy this."
3,Mixed feelings,"You know, I really dislike Britney. Her voice has always taken a back seat to her body, and her completely apparent fakeness in interviews make me hate that she's become sucessfull. That said, In the Zone can be fun. Most tracks are so well-produced that you can ignore the lyrics and singing. If Britney didn't try to be a vocalist (or artist of any sort) and let producers take over, *her* music would be great."
1,What was/is she thinking or is she?,Her antics lately have ruined her music for me. I can't even listen to this album because I don't like the two songs that have been released on the radio. They sound like Minnesota music from the 80's. What was/is she thinking or is she?I received this CD as a Christmas gift but will be returning it unopened because she has just gone too far lately. Is this a good role model for our young girls? Haven't they got enough to deal with in every day life without having someone who is out of touch with reality being displayed as a role model? She's trying to be Madonna and certainly cannot fill those shoes because they haven't been vacated yet.
1,Sadly Horrid,"Gee, what can i say? this is probably the worst cd i've ever heard. it's even worse than any other britney spears (which is really horrible already). i don't know how you people can listen to this trash... i'd give it zero stars if possible... hell, i'd give it negetave 1 million if possible... well don't waste your money on this trash. all copies of this should be contained in nuclear safe landfills to avoid radiation poisoning... anyhow, britney spears is a sad, horrible excuse for a musician."
1,It's over for Britney,"Yes, this album has some catchy club singles, but it's too risque for radio. Britney seems to perform less and less with each CD. Besides 'Everytime', which is not her best vocal work, Britney is constantly drowned by background vocals. Some of these songs sound like the girl bands you hear on the Disney Channel, but with adult lyrics.And on the topic of lyrics, if this is Britney's ""coming of age"" disc, then she's coming into being a tramp. Even my 10 year daughter thinks Britney has become a cheap sell-out. Since when does coming of age have to mean using sex to get a man or attracting attention? Some women, and men, have more class than that.Britney has the body, but Christina has the voice, and there's nothing either of them can do to change that. Britney needed to focus on her vocal ability for this disc to prove that she's NOT just body, but instead chose to sell out and sell sex instead of talent.It's over for Britney."
4,you wanna dance???,"check out the local clubs and you'll hear Toxic and Breathe on Me playing. those two songs along with Me Against The Music are great. the other songs take time to get use to, but once you do i think you'll like it. if you really don't wanna buy the cd for 15 or so, go on ITUNES and buy it for 9.99. have fun and hopefully you'll like the cd. if not don't call me :)"
3,Shows an attempt at growth...,"I rushed out to buy this cd on the very first day it was available, just like with her previous 2, ""Britney"" and ""Oops... I did it Again"", but this cd, while ambitious and showing growth, is a let down. The 3 best songs on this cd are ""Everytime"", a beautiful ballad, the Jamaican rhythmic ""Hookup"" and the bouncy, fun ""Toxic"", but most of the rest are just plain lame. I see her emulating Madonna on songs like ""Early Morning"" and ""Breathe On Me"", but after you hear them once they seem lacking and bland. On the bright side, at least she didn't put anything by Max Martin on this cd. My advice to Britney, keep moving in the direction that you're going but focus on quality."
3,EHHH THIS CD IS OK...,"The first time I listened to all the songs, I hated the CD cuz it's a new style of Britney's that I was not used to. But after listening to it three or four times, I became interested. Out of the 13 songs, I would say about 5 or 6 are decent. So unless you are a hardcore Britney fan, I would not really recommend this CD, but it's ok. It's just a ""new Britney"" - new voice (for the worst), new style, new everything."
2,no....,"OK, I don't hate Britney, so to all the Britney fans, don't say that I do. But the only song I really think is good is Me Against the Music. No other song sounded good, well yea in the beginning it does but after listening to it, I can honestly say I wasted my money....don't waste yours."
3,Not like the first 3 albums,"Things that might help:- leans away from pop- if you never bought any of Britneys previous cds maybe you might like this style- if you have then it will surprise you with something different- you don't hear the range of her vocals- music overbearing her weak, trying to sound sultry singing (get arguilera, simpson, moore if you want to hear good vocals)- ""Toxic"" is the best song- no good lyricsOk, I liked Britney's 2 previous albums because they had some taste in it with good pop music. Sometimes pop doesn't have good lyrics because its the beat that carries it. However, this album doesn't have great lyrics nor good tunes, it sounds messy."
2,Britney puts out yet another mediocre pathetic album,"Let's make this short. This CD pretty much sucks. I was looking forward to the club style songs, and the kind of music that makes you want to get up and dance. But when i listened to it, i was disapointed, as all of the songs seem repetetive, with similar beats that dont really make you want to get up and dance. This CD is so much like her last one, it makes me wonder if she has any other talent then breathing hard with techno in the background. Although some songs have an ok beat overall, Britney has yet again put out a mediocre, pathetic album."
4,Better than what I expected,I am EXTREMELY impressed with Britney's new cd. I was expecting something really cheesy but it has actually turned out to be quite entertaining. I have in my stereo 24/7. Way to go Britney!
5,Britney comes back in full force,I don't know why so many people are bashing her cd because it is simply amazing and by far her best yet. I don't think I've ever heard so many people comment on liking one of her songs as I have with Toxic and the rest of her cd is just that great.
3,"Opened up completely, fair album overall","I think this album fits her most as she finally gets away from songs that suggest she still is in touch with her younger female audience. Songs like ""boom boom"" and ""toxic"" are very good as well as a few others. Overall a good sound but she is more of a performer than a singer or song writer. I think this album fits her best and will complement her stage presence.www.iLLmaticOne.com"
1,I wasted my money and I DEMAND a refund!!!,"In The Zone is a very poor cd indeed with little to no substance. Her voice sounds like mickey mouse on helium ! Britney Spears as a singer has no talent.She has no credibility and I find her image very tired and boring. She isn't bright and her looks have gone down the proverbial drain. She is utterly useless and quite forgettable. In five years from now she will still be trying to find herself but she will no longer have a recording contract. I for one look forward to that day as do countless others. See ya Britney, your 15 minutes of fame look to be close at hand!!!!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is the worst! She is so full of herself and thinks she is ""all that"" (even if she is - she shouldn't be so snooty). I don't think I will buy another Britney cd again. It was a huge disappointment."
1,Yuck - Don't Even Bother!,"This was the most horrendous thing I had ever heard! I apologized to my poor ears for putting them through the grief of listening to it. The only good song on the whole album is ""Toxic"" and that is due to it's catchy beat. Britney is not a bad artist at all. She has had some great songs in the past. She just doesn't do it for me at all with this album. She went too overboard on a lot of the songs, overdoing the remixing and focusing far less on her vocal abilities. This is not worth the money I paid for it - in fact, I gave the CD away."
1,Ok Brittany Spears is Hott........her music is not,"c-mon i get it already Brittany Spears is Hott but it doesnt mean she has good music this is Sell-out MTV crap to the extreme i guess there are some people out there that like this mostly ""Extreme A+F Preps"" but i am not even sure if they liek it i mean of course they can lie but c mon seriously does this music make you think does it make you wonder about stuff no all it makes me think about is brittanys body and how it sells she is bascially a Hooker only instead of jumping bones she is making music and posing her body on the covers and making it look all FUN and TEENY BOPPER and hip...............when will people learn??????"
1,Such an overrated singer!!,"I dont understand why or even how people can say britney is a great singer. She couldn't sing to save her life. This album, just like the rest is overrated and horrible. Whats with the song ""touch of my hand""? I hate the fact that she is desperately trying to be daring and controversial as Madonna. Madonna is great and britney is not!! There is no comparison between the two. Madonna is extremely talented. Britney just needs to be her own person. She cant sing. The only sing she has going for her is her looks, her dancing ability and the fact that she is marketed so well. Thats it!!"
4,an extreme turnaround for ms. spears,"I have previously never been a fan of Britney Spears- I personally don't like pop music, & from what I'd noticed, all of her old songs had no real edge or uniqueness. But I listened to a few of her new songs and was amazed at how much her music ability has changed. I still don't think she has the best vocal range, however she's experimented a lot on this album and it has had a great turnout I think. ""BREATH ON ME"" is a wonderfully haunting song that is easy to dance to and her vocals on this song are great. ""EVERYTIME"" can be compared to other pop-love ballads, however it has a chilling undertone to it. ""TOXIC"" is another great dance tune with good beats and different ranges throughout the song. I give this album a thumbs up and I hope she continues to get better each year, to prove the skeptics wrong."
1,LOL,"Is She kiddin me with this CD? Is this a joke? This is the most Pathetic Cd I have ever heard,I used to be somewhat of a fan But Then This came out,Highly dissapointed.Just do me and yourself a favor DONT BUY THIS CD IT SUX Big Time."
2,Not What I Was Hoping For,"I liked some of Britney's older songs but was never moved enough to buy an of her albums or CD singles. However, when I heard the duet with Madonna off this album I thought it was very catchy, even though the song certainly sounds like it's against REAL music. Then, when I heard that Britney had actually written some songs on here and that she was going for a more adult audience, I decided to buy it today since in it's first week it is available extremely cheap.Let's just say I'm glad I didn't spend much money on this CD. The single with Madonna is the only decent song on this CD, and let's just say Britney can't write any songs. At least she tried, right?All in all, I do not recommend this album. The songs aren't catchy and all sound alike-like one big swirling mess.I'm taking my copy to the used CD store shortly!"
1,Trash,"This is just another exuse to Spears to make money. Have you ever heard her live? Her voice actually singing? Her vocals are really bad. In fact, she dubs most of her concerts becuase no one would come other wise. So This is raelly lame. She's pretty, she could have been a model, or (as she shows) a talented stripper, she seems to enjoy it enough. But aside from her, she voice on this CD isn' even real."
2,Toxic!!! that's it!,"Britney... uhmmm, I really don't like her, literally. I gave her 2 stars, one for her fabulous videos and one for the song ""Toxic"". The song is cheesy but you'll get hooked to it so that's a big plus! She can't sing obviously. The problem is that she is always on air 24/7 so you'll get bored and tired no matter how much she shifts her image. Britney Spears fans, no pun intended but Tina Arena can sing far better than her with cotton wools stuffed in her mouth... Don't buy this album!"
1,Poor taste in lyrics,"Her lyrics are lacking in intelligence and will perforate your ears. There were some tracks that were ok musicwise but her voice obstructed this album. Breahe on Me, Shadow, Everytime, Brave New Girl, Toxic, Me Against the Music, The Answer and Don't Hang Up were semi-listenable but get boring after awhile. Only extreme fanatics of Britney or people who like whatever is popular should pick this one up."
2,Not really in the zone..........,"What happened to the old Brittany Spears? Well, i liked the old one better! The only good song on this CD is Me Against the music with Madonna. But the music video is a little bit over the top!! I reccomend to only buy it if you are STILL a big Brittany fan. If you're not, then burn it from a friend. If you enjoyed the CD Baby One More Time, also by Brittany, then believe me, DO NOT get this CD. This CD's music is so much different then that, in so many ways. That's why I had to give this CD two stars. It was a great attempt, but Brittany is no longer focused on sending her music to kids anymore. She has changed the was she looks,her music, how she dances, and her additude. Overall, this CD ISN'T worth your money."
2,Please don't buy this album..you'll regret it!!,"Once again Britney Spears has proved that she can neither sing or write good songs. She may be a good performer but she doesn't actually EVER really sing!! To be a good artist you must actually sing at a live show Britney!!This album totally sucks like the rest of them and I can honestly say that I am waiting for the day she poses in Playboy when the public realizes that all she is is a pretty face. Trust me, don't buy this album."
1,LOL,all i have to say this is a piece of crap kids might enjoy this from 6 to 13 years old but thats it ...funny record
1,...sigh...,"well... tis not quite up to standard... britney tries too hard to sell records... tis might b her most 'mature' album but she reali doesnt hv e voice 2 carry n bring out the songs... there's no powerful in her voice... honestly, i dun tink her voice is even passable!.. n she's called a 'singer'... tis sure isnt as 'bubblegummy' as e past albums but is enough 2 put it on my hate-list..."
4,BEST ALBUM YET?,"I can't really make up my mind if it is her best yet but it is definately brilliant. I admit I am a fan of Britney, even her first album which was pure pop but she did sort of grow up as I did so thats why I always liked her. People say this album is all about sex sex and more sex. Well I disagree, it has a few references but how many artists don't refer to sex these days. I love every song on this album apart from Shadow which is good but a bit boring. (I got that)Boom Boom is definately one of the best tracks on the album but a lot of them are good. I think people should stop criticising her because this album is brilliant. And whoever compared her to Kylie by saying at least Kylie can sing and has some class has not listened to this album and obviously hasn't seen some of the clothes Kylie wears."
3,Good dance cd,"This is britney's best dance cd ever. It's great for a party. And that's it. She wrote most of the songs...and honestly as a songwritter myself, there not good, ther's just okay. I think britney has the power in the music buisness to do some other type of production, and I also believe that she can sing, but she is not focusing on that, instead she's faking her voice so she can sing better while she dances. It's okay to dance, but it shouldn't be a singers main focus. I've seen old tapes of britney, and she CAN sing, problem is when it comes to recording a cd and choosing songs, even JLO sounds better( and she doesn't have a good voice). If you want a good dancd cd buy it....if not keep your money."
3,a lil shaky there...,"gee whiz. i heard so much good stuff about this CD, which hyped me up even more to get it. so i rushed to get it, and i'm excited to listen to it right.. i was kinda disappointed. you know when you usually go through each song first after listening to a minute of each. i didn't really like any except the last track. toxic is probably one of the best ones, and i think i played that out already. it kinda gave me a headache. i received more of a headache after listening to the rest of the songs thereafter. oh well. britney is pretty"
1,Britney Spears is all my hate,Music isnt money. There's not much more you can say. She treats her music like a buisness. She wrights a couple words in like 3 songs but for the most part she cant wright lyrics. She cant make the music. She can sing. She can dance. She can do buisness. She can look sexy. She is proof that anyone can get famous if they want the money that much. She is a disgrace to music.
3,not suprised,"The new Britney Spears CD is okay. It has a very Kylie Minouge meets Madonna meets strip joint feel to it. Some of the tracks are good such as Boom Boom, Breathe on Me, Toxic, and Outragous. On some of her songs she just seems like she is going through the motions trying to sound sexy and mature. She has also played to her strengths which isn't singing. The CD is okay but wait to buy it when it is $5 not at $15."
5,Very Good,"I think this is her best CD yet. New sound to her my favorite is Touch of my hand(my favorite part is the beginning),breathe on me, and Toxic."
3,A few good singles,"This cd has couple great songs. ""Toxic"" is great, ""Everytime"", and also ""Brave New Girl"" are also worth hearing. Overall I feel that once again, she has tried to break her image of a young girl by adding some shock value, namely, ""Touch of My Hand"". With the exeption of a few songs, this album is a bit boring and lacks musical talent; the beats and melodies are hard to get into."
5,Unbelievable!!!!!,"This is an unbelievable CD! The songs are so infectious with their awesome, eclectic beats. Her ability to entertain and change her style is unreal...she's fantastic! I have been anxiously awaiting this album ever since they announced a release date and I am not the least bit disappointed. I am actually pleasantly surprised that I love it as much as I love her third CD ""Britney"", which has been in constant rotation in my car since it came out two years ago. My favorites so far are ""I've got that Boom Boom"", ""Toxic"", ""Outrageous"", ""Early Morning"" and ""Brave New Girl"", but every song on the disk is a treat! BUY IT NOW!!!"
5,BRILLIANT,"I've never heard such a great pop album in my life! I'm amazed how good the songs are and how great the music and vocals are. Judging from some of the atrocious reviews on this site, you would think this album is awful, however it's just the opposite! I love every single song on this album and it suits any and every mood. All different ends of the musical spectrum are covered, which makes the album that much more interesting. No matter what your taste is in music, I guarantee you'll find something to like on this album."
1,You call this music?,"Britney cannot sing. Well if she can she DOESN'T. All digitally enhanced and a bad job at that. Nothing good about this album except it is the end of her career. Nothing but a performer and she is getting worse at that. Britney needs to stop trying(to sing). She cannot perform live either. CRAP, or lower if possible......"
2,Umm...,"This cd is just alright, I think I liked her first two much better. This album was very over sexualized and a little raunchy. Some of the tracks are nice, but I think she is trying to hard to become the next Madonna, and it just aint gonna happen Brit! I do like Toxic, and the video was kinda cool. I just don't know about this girl... *sigh* There may be hope for her if she uses her real voice instead of the helium-like little girl voice she uses... Anyway... I don't think I'd recommend this cd..."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!,where is the little girl we once knew?If you are looking for teeny bop it is not here.If you want your children to grow up on sexual references this may be for you.Britney has left her MAIN audience in the cold.Her main audience IS children!DO NOT BUY THIS FOR YOUR KIDS!
1,...,everytime and touch of my hand are okay songs... but all the others I could do without. Especualy the songs featuring rappers and r&b beats.
2,She is NOT Madonna!,"Britney Spears is NOT Madonna, she's just an annoying slut with NO talent. She is quite possibly the worst songwriter ever (""Everytime"" is horrendous). THe only song of hers I ever liked was ""Sometimes"" but that was a LONG time ago."
1,Zoned Out!,Britney get a voice! I can't believe people put this girl ahead of Christina and Mariah Carey! Oh and I'm only doing this because some loser Britney fan keeps writing bad reviews of Mariah Carey's Remix album titled MARIAH CAREY THE REMIXES and she's wrote bad reviews about Charmbracelet! Look isn't it enough that you're no talent britney spears is on top! While great artist like Mariah Carey are pushed out! Well you have your fun cause one day it will be all over!
1,THIS IS NONSENSE,Britney i accept ur no more a girl..LOL[ididnt mean thet]can any1 get anmore childish...and sound more bubblegummish..not that im against pop.hell no.but she's just not growin up.the album..is pretty much nonsense.dont buy it..even christina seems to have matured in her music..so has jessica simpson.but this girl hasnt.she's been here long eneough to do something decent atleatswell they'r all the same
5,UPDATE.,HA HA HA!!! TO BRITNEY HATERS (IN THE ZONE) IS BACK ON THE TOP 10 ALBUM CHARTS. Soon to be triple platinum. WHAT NOW FOOL's....
2,What a waste of money...,"to buy a CD. This must be a joke, even I can make much better songs than hers."
1,"Es un mal CD,","Una vez más Britney demuestra que no ha evolucionado musicalmente, y simplemente se basa en mercadotecnia, efectos especiales para disimular su mala interpretación. Unido a los escándalos que obviamente ha producido para dar publicidad a su nuevo material."
4,"Britney Spears ""IN THE ZONE""","This album is not really good and not really bad, and the song ""Me Against The Music"" (featuring Madonna), is not bad, but the rest of the songs are kind of ok, I guess, I mean, the songs are not bad or anything, but it's just that she was much better off when she first came out with ""...Baby One More Time"" in 1999. So, this album is ok. That's why I have it 4 stars. The only song that I think is the best on the album is ""Everytime""."
1,Over Produced,This is such a horrible CD.I think a computer and backup singers sing more than her/.Wast of $$$
3,"A little better than ""Britney""","Britney's new CD seems ""Britney"" but a little more mature. But the real problem is...Why she copy other singers?? Her CD sounds like Kylie, Madonna, Beyoncé... She seems she has to copy other people to make a good CD. And for those who say that Christina haven't got much to do after this Britney's CD... I can say YES! After this CD I realized that Christina haven't got anything in common with Britney. Congratulations Christina; You Won!!!"
1,embarrassing,After all the studio-work and probably plenty re-do Britney still sounds like she cannot sing. By now she has really turned into a sorry and embarrassing artist. She gets worse with each video. And why did Madonna take part ? Is her career already that much down too ?
2,Pathetic,"When I bought this album I was expecting something, maybe even a comeback- after her awful ""Britney"" album, I had my doubts, as the single ""Me Against the Music"" is one of the worst songs of the year, no thanks to the material girl, but getting back task, it was awful. Just a girl who can dance, groan, whisper, and is part of a label with a decent sythesizer, it's not worth your money, maybe miss ""grown-up"" (grown-up? that's just something we've all been waiting for her to do) can go back to the ""less mature"", but good first two albums."
1,How to judge something so controversial..,"I bought this CD with an honest, open mind, although I am not a Britney Spears fan. And I hated it. To me, it sounded like more of the same pop junk thats all over the radio. And thats because I am not into that non-passionate performace-type pop stuff, prefering more simple and soulful music. Hey, thats just me! If you aren't looking for anything deep, just repetitive beats and catchy, traditional lyrics, you may love this CD. That being said, I think this CD should probably only be reviewed by those who go in with an open mind, not self-proclaimed Britney Spears Haters who care more about the girl's image than the music."
5,It's In the Zone,"I haven't been a big fan of Britney Spears lately, with all the nude magazine photos, so low pants, and bras she's been seen wearing, and also her stripper- like dancing. I wasn't so sure of this album at first either. I listened to the cd online at MTV's Leak and I didn't like it at first. The cd is only 50 minutes long, so I could listen again. After listening again, it grew on me, and I was dancing on the floor! You'll realize that most of the songs will get stuck in your head, eventually making you want to buy ""In the Zone"". I especially liked the songs ""Me Against the Music"", ""Toxic"", ""Brave New Girl"" and ""Everytime"". The rest are great too. Even if you are hisitant, buy this cd! You will love it, even if you don't want to."
1,Fight the power,"This is not about music, it's non existent. It's about what it represents.A marketing product sold to the pre-pubescent youth of today.Give them Mac Donald, Cheesy puffs, Pepsi...Buy, buy, buy for God's sake.Everyone is in for the loot : Music companies, radio, MTV, Music Stores. Some are surprised but it has been like this since the dinosaurs roamed the earth.It makes me slightly ill, especially since I am convinced they would make as much money developing real artists."
1,Not my taste,I do not know why I got this CD when I am not a fan of Britney Spears .There are only two songs I like on the whole CD.
5,"BRIT""S ZONE!!!",this album iz realli good!dont pay attentio to those people that say this is s**t......they havent even listened to the album!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!GO BRITNEY!!!!!
2,Boooooo Britney!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I want my money back! Try singing without back tracks and with a live band for once instead of back tracks, I like the jessica Simpson and Mandy moore Cd's much better. Suggest putting your clothes back on and learn to sing for real. Her song with Madonna does not add up to the cost of this junk......Yes I own other Britney CD's just want to sell this one fast."
3,It's Britney...,"...so you either like her or you don't. I am one of the few people that have always been in between. Some of her songs are fun for a while, but there's only so many times I can listen to those songs. The only thing I love about Britney is the performance she puts on... I recently saw her in concert and it was AWESOME! She's an entertainer first and foremost, and a really fascinating, interesting one at that. She can dance around and she knows how to 'shock and awe.' She's a lot of fun but there isn't really anything very musically redeeming about her songs, so don't take her too seriously. I kind of like ""Toxic"" and ""Shadow"" but other than that... it's just Britney."
3,"Britney Can't Sing, But.... 2.5 Stars","I bought ""In the Zone"" and I was disappointed. When I first bought it, I thought it would be good. Here's how I rate the songs.1. Me Against the Music- It didn't work for me. 2/102. (I Got That)Boom Boom- Pretty good. 6/103. Showdown- Unmemorable. 3/104. Breathe on Me- Very sensual. 8/105. Early Mornin'- One of my favorites. 8/106. Toxic- My favorite song on the album is this one. 10/107. Outrageous- R. Kelly wrote and produced. 4/108. Touch of My Hand- Good, but not great. 7/109. The Hook Up- I skipped this one. ?/1010. Shadow- It was kind of weird. 4.5/1011. Brave New Girl- I liked this one. 9/1012. Everytime- A tribute to her ex, Justin. 6.5/1013. Me Against the Music(Remix)- This sounds better than the original. 5/10This is my only Britney album, but this is probably her best. The album wasn't total junk. I did enjoy myself some of the time.Overall- 5/10"
1,lacks..... EVERYTHING,"Oh come on people, you can't be serious. This CD does not stand against anything. The producing is terrible, the songwriting is terrible, the lyrics are terrible, has she actually been able to hypnotize the world of music with her beauty and now sell anything? This CD would not have been signed by any other artist other than Britney. No label would have cared to listen to it. And Britney, now that you are growing up.... actually do it!"
1,What's happened to Britney?,I have all 3 of her previous albums and I have always enjoyed having a bit of a boogie to her songs but I'm sorry this new album is completely lacking! It actually began to really bug me! I didn't enjoy listening to it at all and all I could think was thank **** I didn't actually buy this!If you are looking for something similar to what you've heard from Britney before DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!Her sound has completely gone down hill!not good!
4,Why has everyone gone off britney?,Why has everyone gone off britney spears? I think she is really great and I love her new album. My favorite songs are toxic and Me agaisnt the music.The songs have a really good beat to them and I wish everyone would stop critising her and her album. She has done so well with her songs and I think we should be congratulating her instead of hating her!
5,Britney's back,"I think this Cd is one of her best, It isn't as god as the Britney(3rd one) but is totally one of the best cd's to listen again & again!"
4,In the Zone very well done,"I am a 38 year old who bought this CD because of Madonna being in the first track.I am very impressed with Britneys &quot;in the zone&quot;. The song Breathe is contagious. I listened to it over and over. The song Everytime, is beautiful. Britney has grown into her own. On this album , she is a cross between Madonna and Kylie Monogue. I love this album. I highly recommend it, but I would shy away from getting it for the youngsters. Pick up Hilary Duff for the kids under 17.AudreyTampa Florida"
2,Gave it a chance...,"I tried. I really did. I borrowed my cousin's copy of this album and I tried to appreciate it, but word of warning. If you hate Britney, you'll hate this album. Musically, this album is a total rip-off of Madonna's Erotica, which is now 12 years old. State of the art technology and this is the best she can do. Sure, there's danceable stuff on here, and I'll admit ""Toxic"" isn't a bad song, but I don't see this album passing the test of time like Blondie's ""Parallel Lines"", which is a true genre crosser and a classic work to boot. I was disappointed in ""Early Morning"" because I love Moby, but this totally sounds like something he spit out in five minutes and handed over. The songwriting is such a joke, like in ""Everytime"" (""I'm offering you a sorry""?!?! Please hand this girl a grammer book) Musically, it works for the moment, but give it ten years and people will be wondering what Britney was thinking. Sorry, but like I said-- I tried."
3,This Isn't Bad,"Depends on which Britney you like--the bubble gum Britney of Hit Me Baby One More Time, or the Ghetto Hoochie of the current Britney. All the songs are done quite well, with the exception of her collaboration with Madonna. That song sounds like a broken Casio beat box."
4,Only Britney...,"Only Britney has the power to get me shaking my jaded behind when it comes to the pop scene. I enjoyed a lot of the tracks on here and I hope someday she works with people who are actually cool, and not people like the Ying Yang Twins who are probably as lame and unhip as anything in the universe could ever be. I think Britney is fun. What is the point of ripping on her when there are so many singers out there who suck even worse?"
2,where's the vocal??,"Britney Spears looked good, but CAN NOT sing at all!!! she shows no vocal talent in her last 3 albums. She only sang in raspy low voice. No vocal, hit no high note, nothing impressive with her voice whatsoever. It gets pretty annoying. For those of you that are looking for a singer with talent, don't buy this cd. If your looking for a cd to dance to, buy this cd."
2,A Bit Racey For Kids,"A few of the songs on here are a bit racey for younger kids, like ""Breathe On Me"" although she never admits to doing anything in the song it's pretty obvious what she's talking about although she says ""don't even need to touch me, Breathe On Me"" please! Oh and Anyone who listened to the 90's song ""Legend of A Cowgirl"" By Imana Coppola will recognize the verse rip off on ""Brave New Girl"". I actually like the techno song ""Touch of My Hand"" and the Madonna release is great."
2,Eugh..,"I concider myself a really big Britney fan, but once the newness of this album wore off on me, I realized it's a boring trainwreck of an album.All of the songs are Britney's scream of her loss of innocence. This album seems waay to eager to please and to get Britney some credit back because so many people dont like her. Im not expecting Britney to be deep, but these songs are all meaningless. If one more song featured a line about her low-rise jeans, her ass or her belly, the whole cd could be turned over to some clothes company to mass-produce an advertizing campain.If the songs arent about Britneys assets...its about Britney shaking them at a club. This album is completely entirely boring and pointless once the newness of it rubs off."
1,Britney Spears,"I liked her music when she first started, but as of lately, my wife and I have lost respect for her, as she seems to dress with less and less cloths. No wonder there are so many rumors going around about her, and she wonders how they all start, the first place she should look is in a mirror. I pay for the CD to listen to the music not for the ""Sexy"" appeal of the artist."
4,Never Liked her before....,"i gotta say that i never liked britney before. But after hearing just a few clips from her abc special during random commercial jumps. i found that i really like the songs. So i go out and buy the cd to discover she's really grown. i never liked her before, in fact i was one of those people who intensly didn't like her. But this cd changed that around. Buy it, listen to it. Think about it."
5,HUGE IMPROVEMENT,"Britney Spears has been known for outdoing herself, and once again she does it. This CD is great! 100 times better than her previous ones. The beats and songs are amazing. You'll get hooked to the CD. I think her voice is also better on this. I think Toxic, The Hook up, Everytime are the best songs on the album. Good Job Britney."
5,Britney has Done it Again!,"Britney is such an amazing performer.I have to say out of all the concerts I have been to, Britney is the most entertaining.I have been a fan of Britney's music since Baby One More Time.If you are not a fan of Britney and you buy this cd you'll love her (or fall in love with her all over again.)I think her songs are alot of fun and catchy tunes. She has a variety of songs that are sung in a low sexy voice to her hot dance song ""Me Against the Music"".I saw some of her Showtime concert and I thought it was an amazing tour performance it told a story and it kept you interested.If you should put any money toward a singer, it should be Britney.Just give this CD a chance and you'll be thanking me."
1,SUCKS,"JUST BECAUSE SHE CAN DANCE DOESNOT MEAN SHE SHOULD SING. HE VOICE IS SOOOOO BAD, SHE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL HER DANCING DOES HER JUSTICE"
2,"All style, no substance","""In the Zone"" employs an army of A-list producers and songwriters (Moby, R. Kelly, Guy Sigsworth, etc.), so it's no surprise that this CD is full of tight beats and cool sound effects. But this album is all style and no substance. Even though Britney supposedly wrote 7 of these songs, we learn absolutely nothing about her other than the fact that she's hot, she likes to party, and she broke up with her boyfriend (all of which we already knew). There's also an incredible hypocrisy at work here. Britney pants and moans through almost every track on this CD, and yet in interviews she still strikes her virginal pose, claiming celibacy. If she's telling the truth, what we have here is a girl willing to exploit her sexuality for the sake of her career, but unwilling to enjoy it in real life. That's a screwed up message to send young girls."
1,this album stinks,"britney who is britney is what they'll be saying shortly. Its sad that you have to take off you clothes to sell music. Like the toxic video. i mean she has no talent sure she can dance but so can Milli Vanilli. wait shes just like them theres a record playing music in the back while she dances on the stage...If all you need to do is be able to dance to sell records then I have talent too.Or if all you need is to get naked while you poop,or singI know a few millon people who should have a record deal.Dont waste money spend it on christina who really has talent. OR IF YOU STILL WANT TO BUY THIS CD THEN LIKE MY BOYS MILLI VANILLI SAY BLAME IT ON THE RAIN BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,This is definitely a different side of Britney...,"This album is ok if you don't mind music that has all been done before. It has a few highlight which give the Britney Sound a new twist, not to mention that she doesn't work with Max Martin anymore, so thats one plus for Britney. But even then so, she still has the sound that has already been done again and again by hundreds of other artists. There really isn't nothing too much new here, and if you're looking for shock value, what is that even worth anymore? Britney tries to hard to be shocking that shes not... Don't get me wrong, I like the album, but Britney herself gets old quickly. The highlights are ""Breathe On Me"", ""Toxic"", ""Touch Of My Hand"", ""Shadow"", ""Brave New Girl"", and the beautiful heart-filled ballad closer ""Everytime"", this is definitely a new side of Britney, but not a new side for music in general, so you decide whats best for you."
5,In The Zone,"Britney has outdone herself, with this new CD. The music is much more mature, and is really great. I recommend it!"
1,Sucks,"This is Britney Spears worse cd ever! i am very ""upset"" that i got it! Whoever is thinking about buying this cd listen... britneys first cd was good second really good three the best cd ever! than came this one it is horrible! she trys to rap in it and sound sexy and lyrics are crap! i only give it one star cause she has like three good songs! Help yourselfs out don't buy it!"
5,slutty but still goody!,"For so long the never ending debate of brit being be so inocent OR not has continued... but with her latest album ""In the zone"" the question really is not if she is licentious or an angel, it's about how well did she do in compiling her new music! To appropriately rate this cd, u have to enjoy POP-rock music. To me, I think it would be immature to rate this cd, just because you think she's licentious OR if your genre/type of music is classical/country/hard metal, etc. I'm not a sole brit fan, but just listen to all her 13 songs, it sure can brighten up your day a bit and even send you dancing, except for some of the balads included which still packs a punch. Overall, this is a great CD. WORTHY OF BUYING, NOT PIRATING!"
5,A - freaking - mazing!,"this is honestly the best CD i have ever bought in my life and my Cd collection is really big just trust me on that one. This cd will make you get up and dance i can guarantee it. It has awesome beats great bass, new style that Britney has brought to perfection with this piece of work. I mean, shes not singing in most of the songs, just pretty much breathily whispers the lyrics but it really works for her and what she is tryign to achieve here! Just great i would reccomned it to people who have lots of parties like me beacuse your guests will never be bored! you wont regret buying this CD!"
1,This chick's career is over!,"Let me tell you something, britney spears would have long been gone out of the spotlight if she wasn't doing stupid, outrageous stunts to grab the attention of the media. This album is really bad. Her vocals are terribly computerized & the whole album is pretty much over produced, polished dance pop. All her music consists of light weight dance pop that gives her an excuse to crawl around half naked in her videos. She can't sing & she can't write or produce music. She's not an artist, she's a pin-up model! Her appeal & what sold her music was her sexuality & the media hype, not talent! This album is not worth buying because it's the same as her last three albums along with some hip-hop beats & more computerized vocals. Have fun being pregnant britney, looks like you won't be doing nude photo shoots for a while."
1,This is just sad <_>,"(...)So... a new album from britney spears. All i can say is this.IT SUCKS!I mean come on poeple why are you buying this! It's the same as all her other albums,and really, if you actually LIKE this crap you should be locked up for a long time.Here's some GOOD music1 Fiona Apple2 Charlotte Martin3 U24 Stevie Ray Vaughn5 Nelly Furtado6 Eminem7 Usher8 Jojo9 Michelle Branch10 Destinys ChildI recommend you not get this. If youdo, you're in danger of going insane."
2,I hate titles...,"This CD has only one good song on it. ""Toxic."" That's it. Everything else it sort of crappy. Some of the stuff she sings about are just stupid. The music to the songs is great though, and her voice sounds better. I only got this CD for dancing to it. That's all it's good for, beats."
1,Forget It and Move On,"Thank goodness I listened to a friends before I put out my hard earned cash. I would like to hear Brittany sing without all the backup acoustics (sp.?) and assistance she gets from anything other than her own voice. I'd bet there isn't much there! Sorry, I just don't get it. I think her only talent is reinventing herself in the footsteps of Madonna. She is pretty though, but that doesn't translate into good music."
1,Don't Waste Your Money and Time,I heard the first five or so songs on this CD when a friend had just gotten it. We didn't even finish a song before it became either disgusting or just plain bad. I know that this is definitely not the worst music around when it comes to content and lanuage but I will have to say Ms. Spears has sunk to an all time low. Half the CD is loud music and sound effects that drown out any real singing. Another person with potential has wasted the gift. Don't waste your money and time!
2,oh Britney?????,"oh my. I was disappointed in it considering I like Britney and her singing. I just couldn't get into it. I really didn't think it was her, or maybe its just not my thing."
1,it sucks,My friend bought her CD because she is a loyal fan of Britney. The CD completely sucks lol I can't believe fans are so loyal that even if the artist produce crap they will buy it.
2,Talk sick,"This is not serious music, so I won't take it as so. Most of it sounds like the soundtrack to a soft porn flick, but that is to be expected from a girl who has to get by through selling sex, or a distorted sense of it. This is because Britney just does not have an innate talent, at least not in the music genre. She is selling an image and persona which is sadly, and ultimately, harmful to herself and girls everywhere. Real girls do not resort to selling their bodies as mere objects for the entertainment of men. Girls should look up to some women who are beautiful as people, and not sex objects. And if you want real music by a real girl, go find early Liz Phair."
1,Destroyed My Marriage,"This album was so bad that I threw it at my wife, striking her in the head. I felt bad about that afterwards. I think I'm getting a divorce now. Don't buy this album."
1,brutal,I heard the first 3 songs and realized that those songs are redundant. This album is retarded! Totally waste of money.I think i need to confirm with Ms. Spears about her definition of music... Her voice hurts my ears so badly OUCH!!!
1,GET OUT OF THE ZONE NOW!!,Look i'm not a fan of britney because shes well a B***H. But anyway the only song i like is Toxic. hey people BRITNEY CAN'T SING!! BRITNEY is loosing her touch. Go buy my girl Christina augilera's album!
1,what a joke,This CD is a complete joke. Her voice sounds worse than ever. NO TALENT! She sings like a baby
1,The Worst - dont waste your money or time,"Someone should have banned this cd... it is the worst CD I have heard. A mix of rap and slut in a tight leather outfit - Britney has outdone the definition of ""bad."" The songs are a mixture of different styles and her voice does justice to none of them. The words are trite and lack any form of worthiness.I have a very extensive collection of CD's, but this one will NOT be one, and I have serious doubts that any future attempts by her will be added. Most famous artist enter a ""slut"" phase but the really good ones get back out of it. Let us hope Britney wakes up and manages to realize she has a decent voice before she ends up singing in third rate bars with a cover charge and a pole."
1,Britney more annoying than a flea,"When I first listened to this whole cd, I wanted to gouge my eyes out. This so called performer has no talent at all. The sound of the songs are very simplistic and remind me of her last three albums. She does not deserve to be called a musician. A musician actually makes music and has intelligence. She is way too materialistic and cares about image. Also her voice sounds horrible. I have seen footage of her on Star Search. Her voice was great back then. Britney can be summed up in one word..Obnoxious."
1,The lady is a tramp!,"Girl, I'm sorry, but you really are trailer park trash. You're a talentless, compulsive lying, 55-hour marrying, wild partying Jezebel who likes to steal married men from pregnant Black women. Plus, you can't sing for rice and I'm glad Justin Timberlake dumped you. You ain't fooling me with this ""little-miss-innocent"" garbage. I'm not havin' it! I love Jessica Simpson and she will always be better than you!"
1,Get some real lyrics...and your voice back,"Despite Britney's other albums which were by far, much better than this one, her vocals and sense of style has gone down at a rapid pace. Listening to this CD repeat the same beats and same moans and groans over and over for too many songs was too much to take. She is quickly losing any relation she once had to being a true musician. Spare yourself the agony and money and just replay your other CD's."
3,well....,"I bought this album just for madonna. Some of the music on this is really nice but britney's voice ruined them. Everytime, Shadow, Touch of My Hand, Outrageous and Toxic should have been given to someone with a better voice than this trailer trash woman, or girl, or thing"
1,britney's time is up,industry anaylists have just confirmed that the sales figure of in the zone are bad IN OTHER WORDS THIS AWFUL CD HAS FLOPPED.it would be prudent to ask this lip synching princess to call it a day and retire and spare us folks the agony of listening to such rubbish.avoid
1,what can I say.....,To anyone who has ever listening to good music....I don't need to say anything but...come on it's britney....it's garbage.
1,I Don't Like It,I should never have brought this record. I simply can't stand her voice. The only song I like was ''Breathe On Me''.
1,Cant we please stop this insanity?,"Isnt anyone else just sick and tired of her yet? She cant sing, no really SHE CANT SING!!!! All she can successfully do is shake her a$$ but even that is getting old.Im so tired of all this Britney hype and how anybody can spend money on her cd's is just beyond me.She reminds me of Paula Abdul, not a good voice, a few catchy tunes and creative videos. But now can I listen to those cd's? Heck no, her voice sounds like Betty Boop. As does Britneys. Im so tired of non talented little girls flaunting around like hookers getting paid to shake their a##.Please wake up people and stop buying her stuff, lets just let her career die."
1,"its over guys, just let it die",why do people rally behind this girl. she is a pathetic fake. just let her career die and he wont have to deal with this kind of trash anymore.
2,15 yr. old fan,"This cd is one of her worse! Theres only three good songs on it: Me against the music, Brave New Girl, and Shadow."
3,"From POP to hip hop, not that great","I think this isn't that great of an album. Her other three albums are way better than this and I think she should have stuck with more of a poppish move and not this HIP HOP wierd stuff. I mean the CD is okay having listened to it over six times but its an OK album and i hope on her next album she don't have any bad words and have more songs like Brave New Girl, Everytime, Shadow, Breathe On Me, and Touch of my Hand. Those were basically my favorite songs and also Me against the Music but my opinion i don't like much of that rapping stuff and Earlin Mornin with the background ladies singing shaking my *** in the earlin mornin, that really wasn't necessary. That's all for right now."
4,Better vocals,"Listening to this album I realized that Britney is a better singer than a lot of people give her credit for, but I don't think SHE has figured that out yet. She needs to start singing from her gut and soul instead of constricting her throat. She has been a studio ""product"" and papparazzi target for too long. I hope she doesn't try to rush out a comeback album and that she gets a fair shake from the record execs on her next project."
1,Sick and tired!!!!!,"Yo,I check out all the reviews, and they say ""A Music Fan""..... What's wrong, too ashamed to admit you like Britney?Her music is pathetic; it only proves that anyone with good looks (her only asset) can make it big in music biz. Sure, she has a decent voice, but most of us do (unless you're tone-deaf)Bet you anything Brit wouldn't be as big without her looks. If we were all blind, no one would like her.I grow weary of reviewing all this bull**** music these days. Find me some artists who don't sell out, and I'll be happy. Until then, the only music I can appreciate these days is the White Stripes.(I am under 35 (actually under 25 too), and male, so don't think I'm another one of those parents who disapprove of her or anything.)Too bad I can't rate lower than one star. I would."
1,Britney is NOT a singer!,"Awful! This cd stinks! Almost every song starts with her talking into the microphone. Many songs, you also hear her heavy breathing or laughing in the background. The songs are so digitalized that you never hear her actually singing, and when she does sing, she sounds like she's 12. Lyrics include ""When I'm shaking my ass"", ""outrageous, my sex drive"", ""my sexy jeans"". Yuck, yuck, yuck!!!!"
1,Disappointed :-(,"As a HUGE Britney fan, I was very excited to get this album; however, I was very disappointed after listening to it. It didn't live up to its hype & its so-called much more mature sound. In fact, her voice sounded weaker than all her previous albums. A lot of the songs like ""Shadow"", ""Early Morning"", ""Breathe On Me"", ""Touch of My Hand"" are pretty boring--no climax in the music or vocals--very bland. She mostly whispers & talks in a sexy way than actually singing throughout the album. I wasted my money on this CD & this is coming from a hard-core BRit fan."
1,Worst ever,"This has basically nothing of musical content worth listening to. ""Everytime"" is respectable but it's more a song for someone like Celine Dion. Britney stuggles to get it out. The rest of the CD is junk. Personally, I really like Britney. But, this is really bad. She should stick to the style she's good at. Forget the notion of an ""image makeover"". She can't be something she's not. The supporting cast is to blame for trying to force that issue. Reflects the pathetic state of the music industry in general. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,"The Re-wired, re-worked, re-designed music selling machine..","Brit, or I should say Brit's controllers have produced a new set of carefully crafted pop music for the masses. Oh Boy, regurgitated music! I can't believe that people would even consider buying this stuff but you can sell anything if you hype it enough; and that's what B.S. has been doing.Its still the same old ""look at me I'm sexy"" stuff put into a new box, but then again, what else can B.S. do? Does she have any real talent besides prancing around in a tube top? Of course not. Someday soon, people will wake up and stop buying this, then maybe some real music will be heard on top 40 radio.."
5,Party Up,"Amazing cd! If you are looking for something to just turn up really loud in the car, this is it. Songs thats make you wanna get up and dance, the energy is amazing. She goes from hip-hop to techno to indian/asian sounds all the way back to jamaican rythms. Its really great and worth your money."
2,Mediocre,"The only songs i really liked on this were ""Shadow"" and ""Every Time."" The rest are the typical pop laced with hip-hop like everything else on the radeo. I actually think this is her worst album."
3,Wait to buy it cheap!,"I thought that ""Toxic"" was a great song, but I wasn't as impressed with the other tracks. I thought that some of the choruses were good, and a bunch of them stuck in my head. Its a really good CD to dance to because it has great beats! My final verdict: I would wait until you can buy it used and really cheap...no more than $7-8."
2,Its pretty good....for Britney..,"Putting aside the fact that Britney has no talent, the album is okay. The one song that really sticks out is No. 7, Outrageous. Me Against the Music with Madonna is kind of pointless. You barely hear madonna singing at all, and the song isnt really that great. One good thing about the album, though is its got some good beats, for dancing and whatnot. Even though she has a pretty face, Britney just plain out has no talent whatsoever."
4,"Good, but could be better","I can always count on Britney to give the goods, but I can't say that she gave her very best on In The Zone. There are some excellent songs on here but there is too much types of music that is thrown together: hip hop/r&b, electronica, teeny-bopper pop. So there isn't much of a theme with this album; she worked with a variety of different producers with different styles.Pros:ShowdownBreathe on MeEarly Mornin'ToxicThe Touch of My HandEverytimeCons:(I got that) Boom BoomOutrageousThe Hook UpBrave New GirlShadowThis is just in my opinion, it really depends on your own preference of music. I think that Me Against the Music would of been a lot better if Madonna didn't collaborate, I'm a big M fan but she didn't really seem to have much chemistry with the song. Otherwise, this album isn't a complete disappointment and it's worth buying."
4,Her best yet.,"P(...)I personally think this is Britney's best. She's not the best vocalist, I admit, but the beats and the hooks that this album provides are more than enough to make up for the lack of vocal power. It's an album that isn't made up of pop fluff, for she no longer is aiming for that audience. It's a dance album and a damned good one. Each singer has their own standard so why in God's name are people always trying to fit HER in another standard?The lyrics in the songs are definitely far more mature than what you'd expect but there's a sort of innocent quality to it nonetheless. One gets the feeling she's no sex kitten, just imitating one.Even though the albums sort of falls off at the end, it's a satisfying piece of work from Ms. Spears. 4 stars from me."
2,"Quite good, Not Fantabulous","This album is good. It's just not great. The songs I love I REALLY love, but the songs I don't like I REALLY hate. The best track here is 'Toxic', but other high-lights include 'Me Against The Music', 'Breathe On Me', 'Outrageous', 'Shadow' and 'Everytime'. These are really fine songs, with some good ideas. But some songs are catastrophes, '(I Got That) Boom Boom' and 'Brave New Girl' being two. If you like the singles, get this album. It is good, not terrible, but could have been much better. This album is certainly Britney's best offering to date, and is more mature and interestin than Britney's past efforts."
2,Not her best album,"Short Answer: This album was meh.This album was acceptable, but I never really got into it. I've never been a fan of the club scene, so it's content was hard for to understand. I also didn't like the change to her sound. It was nice for one album (Britney), but it would have been better if it stopped there. Now it's at least a half a decade later, and she is still doing the same thing."
2,Oh dear,"Britney britney britney...what is the music world to do with her? She can hold a tune, but her voice lacks the power others have. Which is probably why Christina Aguilera can get away with more.Her latest effort is a sort of rebellious attempt to get the attention that slipping away from her. Rebellious against the squeaky clean image she was supposed to portray...mind you she's a fine one to grumble, she started the i'm a virgin thing herself. Attention because of the provocative lyrics in her album. doesn't anyone tell her stripping yourself on your video and bumping and grinding around with moans and breathy lyrics does NOT help you get noticed for your talent?This album gets annoying after the first few songs. Leave it on the shelves where it belongs unless you're a rabid Britney fan."
1,The following review will be written in the style of MRe,"Who's Britney Spears?Someone talentless, that's who.Her songs are all loaded with boring cliches.Give me Steely Dan or the Beatles any day, this stuff is just noise.Why doesn't she have any emotion, like Bob Dylan or the great, one and onlyMICK JAGGER (of the Rolling Stones, ladies and gents)Aretha Franklin, Joni Mitchell and Chrissie Hynde (of the Pretenders) are good female singers.THIS IS S#%^!!!"
1,sdfd,"""I read where she's hoping to hear the pitter-patter of little feet and now she's getting her wish. BUT that sound is really the sound of fans leaving the sinking ship in droves. Finally people are waking up to Britney's complete lack of talent."""
4,Great music but..where's the singer?,"First off I admit I have never been a fan of Britney, the person, I do, however, like SOME of her songs. I've always considered Britney as a mediocre singer (notice how 99% of her songs rely on background vocals) but the rythm of certain songs is pretty catchy. In IN THE ZONE, Brit finally leaves behind her pretend virginal image and her bubble gum, corny songs to give us a more mature sounding album (except for track #2, I like all the other songs). However, one thing that you will notice is that you can barely listen to Britney's voice!!!! ALL of the tracks rely on heavy background singers and overlayering. If you dont mind that, I think that it is a pretty decent album, pretty decent music and lyrics but one thing is for sure...she will NEVER be Madonna."
3,well done,"I never thought I would give a britney spears album more than one star, but the day has come! Although her voice needs work and has not been the same since her first album, the music is awesome on this CD. My favourite songs are Me Against the Music, Outrageous, Toxic, Shadow, Touch Of My Hand and Brave New Girl. If you're a fan of Madonna's music or hip hop, you'll love this album. Britney finally changed her sound and has grown up."
5,I love this album,"I agree with some of the reviews already given: although this is cd is very different from mainstream, britney's ability to create such a unique album is awesome! Although I am not a big fan of her two ballads in this album (I felt like she could have done better), the other 11 songs are sooooooo good. Buy the cd today! You definitely won't be dissapointed!"
4,britney is here to stay,"don't let slagging and embittered no-brains push you away from this new one from miss spears. I've reviewed rock, pop blues, jazz and classical albums for many years and have always believed spears was little more than a pre-teenie prefab joke. similarily, many reviewers will approach this new one from the maturing songstress with similar mindset, slagging her off in the easiest way. but this one deserves more than that. do yourself a favour - give the songs a listen. no mean feat, but spears has outdone not only herself but many of her contemporaries in all categories. the reason? in the zone holds many of the most catchy, interesting and varied tunes on offer in a good long while. everything is in the pot here - from rap-enthused big beats to fiddle samples and thumping humping beacons for procreative recreation. unlike past efforts, this is no cheezy corporate menu for musical fast-food. it's a bonafide entry in spears' lengthy output and as it stands, is her best to date."
2,It's ok...Not as good as her other three.,"This album is mostly club music and after a while it gets kind of annoying. I liked the last two songs, ""Brave Girl"" and ""Everytime"" the best. ""Toxic"" was pretty catchy. I think she should just stick to pop music and avoid rap and raggae."
1,:^(,"No offence , well this is by far the worst Britney Spears album that she has made, i was a little dissapointed in it no hard feelings against her or anything but there are like 3 good songs on this album and thats it.....her other albums were pretty good, i'm not tryin to diss her in anyway but thats my opinnion of it!!!sry."
1,The horror....the horror,"Im not 1 of those who wish I could give ""Zone"" 0*. I give it 1* for its sort of good 2 dance 2. Thats the only reason I ever *kind of* liked Brit - its fun 2 dance 2 & sing along w/ her stupid songs; it feels good as while Im no singer, even I outshine her vocally. Here, shes trying 2B serious, as if she matters. She cant pull this off. Half the album is her breathing heavy & hispering the other half is try-hard beats that really dont go with her ""voice"" or style. Blatant ripoffs of other crap music that was popular in past years is abound on this record. Shes an image, not an artist. I hope her time has passed and I want her 2 go away now...make room 4 the next tarty tramp 2 make souless crap 4 us 2 get jiggy with. PS I hate to think of the impact this is could have on her stupid preteen girl fans...oh the humanity."
1,"not a girl, not yet a woman and definitley NOT TALENTED!!!",Britney.........hon' ure album SUKS!!!! WHATS WRONG W/ U? RIDING ON MADONNA'S FAME? USING THE YINYANG TWINS? This album isn't worth....ANYTHING!!!!!
1,in the zone...........,.............should be put in the garbage can.she better hope her fans never grow up to be teens.
1,Bad Influence for children of any age,"Please don't buy this CD for your kids. I am a proud, active mother of twin daughters (11 y/o). Today I spent a few hours explaining why they shouldn't dance or dress like Britney. This was precipitated by my watching my daughters plan to make ""britney"" costumes and dance like ""I'm a slave"" for the neighborhood kids. From now on, I'll be sure to avoid talentless, media-contrived, divas that stay in the headlines for wearings nearly nothing and contributing less."
2,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it","I listened to the whole CD from start to finish, and let me tell you, it was awful. I respect Britney Spears and her influence on the music industry, but most of the songs were just horrible. Granted, there are a few (very few) songs on the album that are good (for example, I liked ""Me Against the Music""). However, this CD is really just full of club music. Really bad club music. Listen to the second song on the album, and you'll know what I'm talking about. Britney used to have catchy songs that you couldn't get out of your head (seriously, who doesn't remember the words to Baby, One More Time?), but this CD is full of very forgettable music. She should have stuck with her old formula. Don't buy this CD."
3,I like her of songs,"I really like Britney Spears's songs and style and i want to her new songs on my mail.Sorry my english is very poor but i try to listen english songs to more understand.Best wish,(...)"
4,Liked Britney's new album,"This is one of her best albums, second to ""Oops I Did It Again."" It sounds sexy, sensual, catchy, and very erotic. I like ""Toxic"", ""Outrageous"", ""Early Morning,"", ""Me Against The Music"", ""Shadow"", ""Touch of My Hand"", ""Boom Boom"", and ""Showdown."" Britney's shift to newer producers, musicians and songwriters are what make this album unique. While I miss Max Martin's familiar presence, this is the direction Britney Spears needs to move now. A lot of people say this is controversial, but this is Britney's more mature effort now."
1,This CD is crap!,"Being a bonafide Britney hater,I gotta say that this album is so crappy that anybody that buys it needs to get help.I mean,who wants to hear this trash.If you`re looking for a better pop artist,I would recommend that you listen to that new CD by JoJo. She`s hot,she can sing and she isn`t trashy like Britney Spears."
1,This is bad!!,Why does Britney Spears sing as if she is being struggled? It's aweful! And this album is totally boring! I prefer her first album better. She seems to be getting worse! The songs in the album are....BORING! I hope she gets some singing lessons and stops singing like she being struggled.
5,Awesome Work!,Britney's new album In The Zone is da bomb! All the songs are absolutley good. I don't have any favorites. All these songs I like. This album is deftinley gonna rock the charts!
1,Fails On Every Level,"This was the album that proved her 15 minutes were up, and was about to become what she is known for as today, non-existant. The songs are terrible, but that isn't even the real problem, the problem is the voice. This woman cannot sing."
3,"better, but...","now, given, i wasn't ever into britney. just not really my kind of music. i must admit, though, this CD is a lot better. it sounds nothing like her old stuff which, as far as i'm concerned, is an improvement by all accounts. there are two gaping flaws, however, both being because it is still britney spears. the voice has gotten on the whole more obnoxious, being even more nasally, or half-whispering, in the attempt to sound hot. the other problem is they lyrics, and man are they bad. not once did i ever enjoy the lyrics, more often i cringed. this said, the people actually making the music on the album have improved, as has the overall sound. it is dance music, with a good beat, etc. as far as music to dance to, this is an exceptional cd. if you're looking for that, most definitely get it; if you're looking for any intelligent lyrics, or anything really musically satisfying, i would suggest looking elsewhere."
3,IN THE ZONE is okay.,I think this CD is just okay. It's not a bad CD but she's done a lot better on previous CD's. I think her best work to date is the BRITNEY album. That album is the bomb. She's still the princess of pop and is rolling in the dough.
1,1 star is too much,"Oh god, this is the worst music I heard since... well since the last britney spears album. She sounds like a chimpmunk on helium and that whole I'm gonna whisper and sound cute thing ain't working. The Backrounds beats are horrible too. This isn't music. It's an example of what not to do if you really want to be labeled a singer."
1,This is a waste,"I have the displeasure of having to listen to this awful cd at my job everyday. Britney attempts to reach a more diverse audience , and that is rather tough for an artist who isnt that diverse. With guest appearances by rappers ,& techno remixes of singles, its obvious that this has-been pop star is desperate. Im assuming she wasnt counting on an audience of intelligent listeners , and more or less kids who watch TRL relligously. The production of the sound ( or beats) is good , but since she cant sing either the singles that are remotely decent are filled with corny choruses and hooks.The sad part ( which may make me seem hypocritical ) is that the dumbest songs from this albulm are in my head . Like I said earlier get this for your daughter , guys your girlfriend will dump you ( your better off giving her an apron , lol) , and your friends will sue you if you buy them this as a gift."
1,Britneys Album In Da Zone,Well i liked toxic and in the zone but all the rest are rubbish!!!!! I was really disapointed as i have all britneys other albums but i will NOT be buying this album!Trust me it is nothing like her other work and it is not impressive!!!!! You would be better off (A LOT BETTER) buying Christina Aguileras album Stripped as she has 20 songs all written by her!!!! She also has an AMAZING voice unlike Britneys which is TOO LOW and alieny and croaky!! Hope this helps!!!! Karen
1,LEAVE THIS ZONE IMMEDIATELY,I JUST CANNOT COMPREHEND HOW ANYONE CAN MAKE SUCH AN AWFUL ALBUM.THIS CD IS ONE OF THE WORST RELEASES OF THIS MILLENIUM ALONG WITH JUSTIN'S CD. LOUSY SONGS LIKE TOXIC AND BOOM BOOM WILL MAKE YOU ILL.NOT RECOMMENDED.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.MINUS TEN STARS.
1,"Britney, tell your agent to log off!",Perhaps if 'A music fan from USA' (a.k.a. Britney's agent-that's my guess) logged off and got her some voice lessons rather than typing in bogus reviews she would have a chance against vocal superstars like Jones and others.
1,Wow! Slap in the face!,"What happened to you Britney? This CD is horrible. Don't buy it. Spending a penny on this would be a waste. Britney used to sing good songs with pop that showed off her ability to carry a fantastic tune. Now that she's older, popular, and knows it, she went from innocent, pink, and sweet to ""I'm so hot, might as well do a crappy album.""The songs are terrible and very techno-ish, I mean where did that come from? I especially hate ""Toxic"" I mean, have you seen the video? Yuck! This CD sold well because people probably expected it to be great like her other albums, without even listening to it first.Britney get a clue: Change may be good, but not this kind of change!"
3,In The Zone,"This new Britney Spears cd is ok.It is not her best work.The only good songs on the cd are:""Me Against The Music"",""Breathe On Me"",""Toxic"",""Shadow"",and ""Everytime"".All the other songs are just ways to fill the album.She should have put better songs on the album.If you are a true Britney Spears fan,then buy the album."
4,SURPRISED,"I was not a huge fan of Britneys until I heard ""I'm a Slave For You"" and even then I was only into that song. ""In The Zone"" finds Britney at her sexy best. The song ""Toxic"" is one of the best dance pop songs of the decade. ""I've Got That (BOOM BOOM) is equally addictive. ""Outrageous"" gives Beyonce a run for the real queen of pop. She does not have a beautiful voice but neither did early Madonna. What she does have is star quality. Whether you like it or not Britney is the pop icon of today. She is what Madonna, Prince, and the Jackson siblings were yesterday. I Like It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Suprisingly Fun,"This CD is full of tracks that are fun to dance to and sing to. Britney has finally realized that she is not a singer and only has two earspliting ballads- ""Shadow"" and ""Everytime"". Other than those two stinkers, this is a great disc to dance around to. Keep it from the young kiddies, though- it's a lot racier than her previous CDs. My favorite tracks: Me Against the Music, Boom Boom, Early Mornin', Outrageous, and Brave New Girl."
1,Pardon me while I puke,"Just by seeing this album on the rack and people actually buying it, I've come to realize that our society has reached new lows. We're so constantly ruled by corporations and MTV (I'm not even sure if the ""M"" stands for ""music"" or not) that the fragile minds of young people today are so obsessed with these ""musicians"" that they worship and idolize them until they become demi-gods.I hope that America will soon get over this phase of celebrity-worship and obsessiveness so that I can feel secure in knowing that there is hope for humanity.P.S. If you want real music, I'd recommend A Perfect Circle's new album (""Thirteenth Step"")."
1,Way out of the Zone,This cd is just plain awful. I agree with the other reviewer on this. Pink Try This cd is better musically than this. Madonna does not even help this cd at all. the entire cd sounds like rejectes from the previous album and some actually some like I'm a slave 4 you.
1,A total waste,"Absolutely the worse album Britney has made. Keep this up and she's old news before her 23rd birthday. Since when is moaning, groaning and giggling considered music? Very BAD decision to hitch up to middle-aged Madonna too. Britney should spend less time partying and more time trying to develop a VOICE. It doesn't exist on this cd."
1,"Please, Really, Please........Retire....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Britney....stick to what seems to be your calling, making headlines.......Leave the music making to the real artists, like Christina Aguilera.....You can take some singing lessons from her.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,I Find a Good Album!,"Good first that I don't like everything dog's image that has britney their marriage in the vegas this I finish with kevin, good that it is not the case this album I give him 4 stars because Toxic is excellent has a rhythm, a thing that makes that you fall in love with a, Everytime is magic had never listened a Pop Ballad so relajante and as beautiful as this Me Againts The Music A lot but the Step, another good one is Shadows had wanted him to be simple but not, of the simple ones that I take out I not like two but and the rest of the disk less 3 songs."
1,This is pathetic......,"yes,, Britney spears is smokin hot,,, so when a new cd comes out that means 3 or 4 new hot videos... but it also means 3 or 4 new god-awful songs!Who the hell over the age of 12 is actually dumb enough to LISTEN to this garbage?? As if Avril and Hillary Duff arent bad enough, then Christina Aguilera had to come back, and now her again! Total garbage....Buy this cd only if you want to look at the booklet pictures, in the mean-time music wise I'll be picking up that new Dream Theater cd..."
5,Watch Britney Grow!!,"Oh my!! I just LOVE this album! It's so good!! I agree with the other reviewer who stated that you can't judge the album just from hearing ""Me Against the Music"" (MATM) MATM is a good song but the ones I like a whole lot better include ""Toxic"" and the ""Boom Boom song"" I loved the song ""Everytime"" when she sang it on Saturday Night Live but the one on the album, in my opinion, isn't as good. With all that said, this is a definite album for working out, cleaning house, and dancing out at clubs as it really has some beats. Turn it up in the car and the bass gets pumping! Who would of thought?? Great Album Britney! Hit us one more time...or many more for years to come!"
1,Not Again!!!,"When will she understand that she has no vocal or lyrical talent? The music really gets worse with every CD released. MTV-fed kids, turn off your TV, start to think, then go get REAL music!!!!"
3,In the zone?,"Im a little dissapointed.. her albums before this one were better, it might take a little time to like this one.. i have heard way better from her so im sad..."
1,"So the lesbian has a new CD, huh?","Interesting, I guess she wants Madonna to hit her baby, one more time. Britney was good when her first CD came out and I loved it. When ""The Neptunes"" produced her second CD's hit (though they just took the beat from Philly's Most Wanted's 'Please Don't Mind') that was tight, too. Now, she's gotten ridiculous. Don't get this CD, get Cyndi Lauper's new one instead."
1,Wasted dreams,"This is so tasty. I slapped it into the microwave for five minutes and I then proceeded to devour the contents from start to end. The next morning I squatted on the porcelain throne and dropped a medium sized turd. To my complete surprise the turd bore a striking resembelance to Britney. Wow, I thought maybe this cd was interactive after all. Afterward, I decided to ingest my entire music collection to see what the results would be. I now have the largest wax(funny smelling wax)museum this side of Hollywood. Thank you Britney!"
1,Awful,"Britney Spears is probably the most awful thing to hit music within the last 20 years. She is so terrible that it is painful to listen to her. She cannot sing at all. God only knows why she would title a song ""Me Against the Music"". It just asks to be made fun of. It sounds like someone is choking her on every song on this stupid CD. She is not a pop star and she is not the next madonna. She does the same thing over and over again and people keep eating it up. Like ""I'm a Slave 2 U"" is so much like ""Me Against the Music"". She is so afraid to try new things. Pink is awesome. Buy here albun, Try This, instead. Pink is the next madonna, becuase Pink keeps re-inventing herself, where as britney is too afraid to even change her hair color! Do not waste your money on this piece of garbage!!!"
1,now now now,"if I didn't like britney the person and her music was good, then I would be giving her five stars. But i can't stand her voice and having a pretty face doesn't make for it. Maybe about 5 songs are alright, but her voice just ruins them. Not worth the money"
1,~~~~~POOR BRITNEY~~~~~,"honestly this has to be the worst Album to date....she can't sing ,and she definitly can't act .........even giving this cd a 1 is taking it to far this cd really should not even be on store shelfs......i really can't stand her and what about her little *stunt* with madonna it was just a publicity act and with me i just thought it was just wrong but please DON'T BUY THIS CD IT WILL BE THE WORST CD YOU WOULD EVER BUY!!!!!!!"
1,Garbage,"I don't understand how this woman can still sell CDs?Oh yeahShe appeared everywhere, award shows, interviews, trl, concertsShe appeared in many magazineShe kissed a lady that could possibly be her motherCD has good beatsFor a person who has to do that much to get herself out theredon't expect much,"
1,I think she Zoned Out on this one,"Simply put, I wish I hadn't wasted my money. The song I like best is track 1. I should have just gotten the CD single. Now I'm off to sell it to the local re-sale record store."
1,Pitiful,"My 5 year old niece wanted this, so I bought it for her. She doesn't even like it, prefering to listen to Oops! I Did It Again. This garbage is so generic, to be laughable. Britney's vocals (never her strong suit) are poorer than ever. I did like her first two cd's, but the last two are plain bad-this one worse then the last. And Britney needs to get over trying to become some kind of party animal in her lyrics. These lyrics, as well as her interviews, just make her seem sad and shallow."
1,PURE AND UTTER FILTH,"This cd is awful. The lyrics are so filthy. It seems Britney Spears is taking great links to be the next Madonna. It's a good thing the music is so loud that it drowns out her singing, if you can call that singing...not that any of her other albums sounded professional. In my opinion, Britney Spears better thank her looks for where she is today. This album is a disgrace."
1,She's a lip-syncing stripper,This latest offering from Britney Vanilli (has anyone ever heard her actually sing live and not just lip-sync?) is just track after track of trash. She is clearly devoid of all morals and no longer appears interested in even pretending that she had any shread of dignity left.
1,I wish BRITNEY could do something better!,"I don't understand the commercial PRODUCERS, they produce the fake singers and force it in the public minds. Since a lot people don't know the difference between good and bad they finally buy it. Britney is really bad in this CD. I was waiting more maturity in the WORK. DISAPOINTED here. Don't buy it if you like your money!!!!"
1,More like... In the TWILIGHT Zone,"I just don't get it! Is it the hype? 'Cmon is there any detectable vocal talent here? Sorry, but just can't find it on this album! Her voice is so achey on this album that it's painful to listen to, like ER at 2am. Freaky! The farther you get into the album the more excruciating it becomes. Hello Rhythm! Are you home? I am afraid to see what people look like dancing to this, seriously scary. Too bad she learned nothing from Madonna except publicity stunts. This pop is so flat that this album belongs with that open Pepsi sitting out for day (although tastes like years). There are far better ways to waste your money. So awful, it isn't worth the dust."
3,Eye Candy for sure!,"I have never been a fan of Miss. Spears. However, when I first heard Toxic I was hesitate to admit I like a Britney song. The first song with Madonna was a marketing techique after her lesbian kiss with the ol' crow, plus it sucked! Overall, I feel she is nothing except eye candy, and a money making machine for her record label, and her parents. I heard the controversy concerning ""Everytime"", the video is interesting, the lyrics are a cry out for help, and to Justin. I just hope she is done with her career soon... I am a little tired of her antics, flashy attire at every Hollywood/Music Award show gala."
5,Great Album!,"I highly recommend ""In the Zone"" to anyone. Each song has something different to offer and nothing sounds the same. I was especially impressed by the quality and artistic elements of songs like Touch of My Hand, Toxic, Early Mornin', Breathe on me, & Everytime. Whether or not you're a fan of Miss Spears, I guarantee you'll find something to like on this album. This is definitely her best work to date and truly the best of pop music!"
1,More Of The Same Old Fluff!,"I heard Britney's new cd ""In The Zone"" playing in my local music store and I decided to listen to it from one of their audio sampling machines. All I can say is the music itself is nothing but electronic beats and keyboards. Her voice is covered up by much of the electronic music which isn't a bad thing because Britney's voice is just average. There wasn't one song that stuck out as being exceptional, this is just a mediocre cd that mimicks the likes of Madonna, Christina Aquilera, and Janet Jackson. I'm a female and I enjoy girl groups/singers, but give me Stevie Nicks, Carly Simon and Carole King anyday over Britney. Even when those singers were in their twenties they were far more talented singers than Britney will ever be."
1,Oh Please!,Why do people keep making such a big deal over talentless performers like this? Does anyone honestly think they'll be listening to Britney Spears in 10 years or care who she's dating? It's the shamless promotion of people like this that denies legitimate musicians their chance to be heard. Thank God for the Internet where you can find true up and coming artists.Attention Record Companies! Quit crying over people trying to download music from the Internet. Maybe if you offered up some decent music people would start buying CD's again and maybe even pay $$$$.
4,We be jammin',"No pop snob, I. Britney Spears' previous hits tell the story. (And the story is: Britney knows how to make damn good danceable hits.) With her latest CD, the Big ""B"" steps into the zone with some ripping tracks. Current fave: ""Early mornin'!"" Hello??!!! This song GETS DOWN, y'all. ""Toxic"" is an excellent track that is really cool and danceable. But first and foremost, Britney has struck again up with another worthy smash hit, featuring the memorable line: ""Hey Britney, you say you wanna lose control, come over here I got something to show you..."" sung by none other than Madonna. The tune is already a pop classic, in my humble opinion.Look, Britney Spears hasn't sold 50 million albums because she sucks. Get over it, ye who insist on throwing rotten tomatoes at the girl. Sour grapes, people."
2,In the Zone or Out of the Loop?,"I was fairly disappointed with Britney's new album,for one she is all over the place with the record switching from hip-hop to reggae to techo to soft ballads not that that's always bad but she just didn't pull it off.I give her A for effort but I think she could of done better,sounded like a rush job Britney!Best songs on the album:Me against the musicI got that Boom BoomOutrageousShadowEverytimeI won't say it was a complete failure on the album because I did enjoy some of the songs and I am a fan of Britney,but she just didn't do it for me this time but I'll let you other fans be the judge of what it might do for you!"
4,IN THE ZONE ROCKS!,"This album is great because it is moslty a lot of dancable songs that talk about her life and private thing most people are not willing to talk about. Everytime is a great heart-felt song.You can shake ur ass with songs like (I Got That) Boom Boom and Outrageous. I've heard the whole CD and I think it's got pretty good stuff, even though we all know that Britney isn't the greatest singer ever, she did a good job!"
5,"Great...But Where's the ""PARENTAL ADVISORY"" sign",This CD is one of the best CDs I've bought. There should have a parental note on the cover of the CD because most of the songs talk about tings kids under 12 shouldn't listen to.
2,"I can do it, too...","Tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12 and 13... great...The songs that I left out, 7,8 and 11 -- stupid, pointless, grotesque and nasty.bad example for young teens. teaches about promiscuity and improper sexual acts with oneself. if people had been made to do that there would only be one person in the world because one person cannot reproduce without the help of a mate of the opposite sex."
2,Throw away the singing and keep the music,These beats are extremely great and good for MCs but Britney gets worse and worse with each release she has a terrible voice and she cannot sing what so ever.But the beats have a dance and awesome rap feel to them buy it for the beats.Lyrics 2/10 Production 10/10 X Factor 5/10 Classic 5/10 Me 6/10Overall-28/50-56% wich is good for a 2 star rating
3,Parents beware...,"If you're looking at this as a Christmas gift for your young daughter... beware. Although this has many songs with a catchy hook that I find even myself singing along to, several of the songs reflect her newly found maturity. Unless you don't mind your 8 year old singing a song about masturbation, I'd only recommend this for listeners about 16 and up."
1,the worst album of all time by the worst singer of all time,"britney new album is a new definition of the word sucks how can this artis keep on saling is beyond me. the ""new"" trip hop sound has the worst beat of all time. why do people keep on buying cd's with talendless singers who don't know anything about music in the first place.buy the beatles album or any other rock band like the white stripes ""elephant"" or coldplay live 2003 or u2 if you want to hear real music."
1,WHO LEFT THIS STINKY LADY OUT OF HER GATE..?,"This girl's music is an ofense for everyone! This album sounds just the same as the last 3 or 4...The worst part of it is that Madonna accepted singin' with her, it seems she lost her mind and is leaving her crown someone doesn't deserve it. A total shame, and a total money waste. This girl is just made out of marketing and dumb scandals.I woul call this thing ""trash music"" or ""waste-of-time-money-album.Down with ""Bitchney Spears"""
1,"many people like her, and I'll never understand why","Her songs are most craps. one day, I woke up and her songs was being played on the radio. guess what, I had a miserable headache all that day. and when I first listened to 'Me against the music', I easily noticed she hadn't been changed at all.and when I listened to the song 'Toxic', I was about to throw up. It sounded disgusting to me!Please do not buy any of her albums. Money is very important in you life, and you know that."
5,Great,"Don't ever miss Showdown, toxic, Outrageous, Brave new girl, Shadow and Everytime. There's something for everyone (except rock so stop suggesting people to buy evanascence instead)One-star reviewers have not listened to it and they're the ones missing out on the good stuff anyway. I love almost everysong and don't judge the album by that crappy first single (me against the music).Recommended for britney and nonbritney fans. And for whoever said that this album was a flop, this album is the strongest female release of this year (after alicia keys). It's less compared to her previous massive hits but in today's music world no artist can sell more than what In the Zone just sold.Buy it!! Worth it!!"
5,"if you are not a pop fan, why do you bother??","If you do not have a taste for pop, i do not see why you should be here bitching about Britney Spears's 'In the zone'.There's some good music in here and yes, do not judge the album by its cover. Sure, everyone will stick up their noses when they see Brit's name on it. But this CD happens to contain some great pop music with flavours of rnb and hiphop. There is a big variety of music here including a touch of chinese, indian, reggae, southern, classic club, pure club and even a couple of good ballads.Pick it up now if you happen to be a pop fan."
2,Heard it all before,"Quite frankly, it sounds similar to the previous album and I'm not sure if writing raunchy lyrics means she has become a more mature song writer. Not a good buy."
2,Britney Had Better Albums,"Britney Spears isent back at all. Her new album ""in the zone"" clearly states that spears isent quite IN THE ZONE. Her album has (4) Great songs, ""Outrageous"", ""Touch of my hand"",""Breahte on me"", and ""Toxic"". The rest of her songs reak with electronic voices, and off rythm beats. She ""trys too hard"" with this album. I was surprized she debuted at #1, ""it must of been all the fans that had fallen for her first single""""Me agianst the music"". Speaking about me aginst the music, the only reason why it sounded ""OK"" was because of madonna, other wise its ""wishy washy"" and ""Boring"". She wants to be a sexy symbol, but that's all ready taken by Willa Ford. Britney, quit smoking, quit crying about justin and GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!In conclusion, if you have $12.99 that you dont want to waste, than Save it. This is not the album you need to run to, yet walk to. You can wait for this one and donate the money for a better cause. ( for the homeless )"
3,UK version has more songs!,"Once again U.S. consumers are ripped off. The European/U.K. versions have two songs not included on the U.S. album.Other than that, this is fun, trashy music. It's unfortunate that girls like Britney seem to equate maturity with whoredom."
5,In The Zone,Britney makes her final transition into womanhood with her 4TH album.1. Me Against The Music10/10 The best song on the album. 1ST Single2. (I've Got That) Boom Boom6/10 Good song. Not my fave.3. Showdown3/10 Not one of Brit's best songs...4. Breathe On Me7/10 A good song with a good beat.5. Early Mornin'2/10 I think this is Britney's worst song!6. Toxic9/10.

Me Against The Music (Remix)10/10 A Cool way to end a cool album
2,Britney Spears-In The Zone Is Definitely Disapointing!,"Spears' latest album is very weak! Not only is her voice begining to sound even more childish before, but it's also being covered with electronics! There's a few good songs on this album: ""Brave New Girl""-excellent, ""Everytime""-although not the best, vocally, the song is a great ballad and ""Shadow""-yet again not vocally powerful, but a great song, nonetheless.Spend your money on her first two albums."
5,wow!!!!! speachless,I AM A HUGE BRITTNEY SPEARS FAN.I HAVE ALL HER ALBUMS AND THIS ONE IS THE BESTNOTE THAT IT IS NOT FOR KIDS.I AM A KID BUT A HUGE FAN.EARLY MORNIN IS THE BEST AND FASTEST.SHE REALLY HAS MATURED AND GROWN UP.100% WORTH THE MONEYI WOULD RECCOMEND IT ANY DAY!!!!!!
1,What a waste of money!,I was appalled when I found out that Britney made a new album. I was even more appalled after I listened to it. This album had absolutely no real music in it. Just some catchy dance beats with a chick attempting to sing. Britney seems to lose more and more talent after every album. Mabey she should just make videos for now on because the only way she'll make any money is by taking of her clothes in her videos like she normally does. This album is a waste of money.
4,"""In The Zone""","Ok, I've never actually been a Britney fan. I've never bought one of her other CD's. But theres something about this CD that I really like!For a start, all of the songs make sense. Theres no silly lyrics like ""Hit me baby... one more time"". Instead, the lyrics seem to be based more on personal experiences.My favorite song of the album would have to be ""Toxic"". It's a really cool, edgy song, and it makes you wanna get up and dance!!Another favourite would be the heart-felt ""Everytime"". This, also, is a great song!If your a fan of either Hilary Duff or Christina Aguilera, then you'll probably really like this CD. If you're more a rock person - then stay away!"
5,In The Zone,I love this cd . I've been playing it non stop since I bought it .Every song on this album is amazing and her voice sounds amazing . My favorite songs on the album are Toxic and Breathe on me.This album is way better then her previous albums
1,In The Zoo....,"I brought this Album after hearing ""Everytime"". I regret it after listening to the whole CD. She has lousy voice!!! She reminds me of my trip to the San Diego Zoo!!"
1,More of the same crap,"Why people think this girl is special is beyond me. She's nothing more than a no-talent who wishes she were Madonna (but sorry to tell her she'll never be on Madonna's level). What can I say? The girl can't sing, her songs have no point, and she tries to be shocking, but she's not. Everything she tries to shock people with has already been done years ago. And do we really need more songs about how she's not a girl anymore and she's a woman now? Enough already! We get it! On this album her songs sound the same as her previous 3, filled with cheesy lyrics, plain Pro-Tools music, and computerized vocal effects (but even that doesn't help her terrible voice). I don't have anything against Britney, but what has she done that's so great? Oh, well. If you like wasting your money, go for it!"
1,Zero Stars: Another confirmation that garbage sells,"Still wondering why music is dead? Because creatures in garb with no talent(like this girl called Britney Spears), plus a marketing and media hype have all killed it. These wannabe artists happen to be the rave these days. So if you wanna get a record deal, you think you look like a Barbie doll with absolutely no talent, can make some cheesy, boring and uninspiring music, you've just about got it made. Ask Britney,Justin Timberlake, Eminem, Ashanti, NSYNC and some of those jokers out there who have subjected us to undue torture we have to be faced with when we listen to radio or watch tv. Is this the future?"
3,A Few Good Songs,"I bought this CD because I wanted to see what it would sound like. Well, this is different, but it still seems like she is recording the music that other people want her to. It does not sound like ""Britney's music"", but ""Jive Records"" music. I think if they threw Britney in the studio and let her do whatever she wanted, it would be a lot better than ""Me Against The Music"" and 8 other songs on this CD. When I first heard ""Toxic"", I did not like it, but it is the best song on the CD and one of the best pop songs of the year. I think Britney should reevaulate her career and then try recording a good album."
3,In The Zone,"However coy she might be in her public statements, Britney Spears leans more than a bit toward the provocative on In the Zone. Less concerned with aiming at the mainstream radio dial than in the first days of her career, she and her collaborators make this as street and club ready a record as possible. The opening duet with Madonna, ""Me Against the Music,"" is worthy, but the bigger superstar?s presence serves almost less as a performance than a key to Britney?s intentions: as Madonna did on albums such as Erotica , Ray of Light, and Music, she?s out to bend current trends to her needs. R. Kelly, Moby, and Ying Yang Twins all provide stirring moments that draw on everything from Bollywood to Southern hip-hop, while one of the most impressive tracks, ""Touch of My Hand,"" joins the proud tradition of Cyndi Lauper?s ""She Bop."" She still lacks a fully formed artistic vision of her own, but Zone, with its many get-free anthems, puts her much closer."
1,The End,"This ""album"" officially marks the end of music. Britney Spears will go down in history as the person who destroyed music."
3,Britney can do better.,"Britney's first two albums were great, her third was horrible, but this is just okay.Me Against The Music- This song is the reason why I wanted this album. I love Madonna! 5/5(I Got That) Boom Boom- Ugh! Don't let me get started with this one! 0/5Showdown- I hate it! 0/5Breathe On Me- Britney, do not release this as a single! 0/5Early Mornin'- I used to like it, but it got a little boring. 1/5Toxic- Good song, horrible video! 3/5Outrageous- This song's title lives up to it's name because of how outrageously bad this song is! 0/5Touch Of My Hand- Why on Earth did this song make the cut?! 0/5The Hook Up- No comment. 1/5Shadow- Good song. 4/5Brave New Girl- All right! Classic Britney! 4/5Everytime- Beautiful song, hate the video. 3/5<(...)"
5,Amazing!!,"This has to be the best pop CD produced in a long time!! Every song is brilliant and offers something different to the listener. Highlights are 'Breathe on Me,' 'Toxic,' & 'Touch of My Hand.' Don't hesitate to buy this CD, I guarantee you won't regret it!!"
4,Not completely in the zone,"Britney Spears has made another radio friendly album excluding two songs, ""Breathe on me"" and ""Touch of my Hand"". The provocativeness of these tracks offer a new light on the fact that she probably didn't just lose her virginity. The other songs on the disc are in a strange sense what was expected. What you get is what you see. I have no problem with her ""growing up"" but is it to hard to make a song that no one would expect. The only possiably radio hit would be ""everytime"". The rest of the disc will make great vidoes inwhich will have no problem becoming only video hits. The overall satisfaction level after listening to ""In the Zone"" would be a 6 out of 10."
5,SHE IS A WOMAN NOW,"Thank god Britney stopped working with Max Martin and the rest of the other producers she worked with in the past. Also, the Neptunes are old news. This album is a gigantic step forward from her last one. The club oriented songs are the best. Breathe on Me, Touch of my Hand, and Early Mornin' are going to sound great in clubs. Everytime and Shadow are great ballads because they don't take a true singer to sing them. They are simple melodies that Brit can sing with ease. Not crazy about the Ying-Yang twins song though. The banjo is a nice touch however. This is a definite must-buy."
1,her worst cd yet,"This is not an impressive album. I thought maybe Britney would make a good comeback after her 6 month hiatus. The songs aren't anything to write home about. They are extremely ordinary. She sounds constipated in Me Against the Music, and sadly that's the best song on there. Unfortunately she hasn't developed her ""talent"" much at all, she still sounds babyish, her singing is nothing compared to Christina Aguilera. I think eventually people will get sick of her image and she'll have nothing left to really offer."
1,Barf...,"Haven't heard it. Will never hear it. Would never want to hear it. A Madonna-wannabe and a terrible ""artist"". Can't wait til she's washed-up...and it won't be long. 14 min and counting..."
4,I think I expected more.,"I like the album. Maybe it will catch on more for me as I hear more singles released. Maybe she will release different mixes as airplay singles. The reason I say I expected more is that I don't think it matches up to her previous album.My favorite track is Toxic. I like the mix of acoustic guitar and strings in a very unconventional way/sound. Both give the song this ""tripping over the music"" feeling which I tend to really like. Whenever I listen to the track, I always want it to be longer.I don't like the choice of the second single being Shadow, which I just heard on the radio the other day. I think this ballad needs a lot of more developement on the part of her voice and the instrumentation in order to pull it off well.Everytime is an awesome track. Give it a good listen, as well as Touch Of My Hand.I've heard a lot of talk about Breathe On Me. I don't really care for the song. Listening to Breathe On Me reminds me of a Kylie song, pick one."
3,Definitely a New Britney,"This is definitely a new sound for Britney. I have all of her other CDs, and this one is TOTALLY different from the others. It's not in a bad way. I can't even say which one is the best, because they all sound like totally different artists. 'In The Zone' is really a more risque CD than her others. She gets a lot more personal on this album, for sure. I like 'Britney' better than 'In The Zone', but it's a very good dance/workout CD. 'I Got That (Boom Boom)' is probably one of my favorites on the album. I like the Hip-Hop feel of it. 'Toxic' is kind of an eerie sounding track, but it's very fun. A good song to dance to when you're bombed. Overall though, the album doesn't even sound like the ""Britney"" we all know. Give it a chance, and you may just like it!"
4,Unbiased,"I think I'm pretty unbiased, because my view of Britney has always been pretty neutral. I have listened to all her previous albums, and this one is by far superior. There's no filler on here, just good music. It's true that Britney's vocals aren't spectacular, but she has really improved as an artist and songwriter. I was espescially impressed with both her songwriting and lyrics on ""Everytime"", which is definitely a beautiful song.I think this cd was worth buying, because it's hard to find a good-quality, upbeat, diverse dancing cd nowadays, and In the Zone is a nice addition to my cd collection.I'd also like to add that this cd is in no way a ""teenybopper"" cd. The music is aimed at adults with taste. I enjoy music such as Frank Sinatra, ABBA, Michael Jackson (in his better days), The Beatles, and more recent artists like Evanescence, Eminem and Christina Aguilera. Just be open to Britney's new cd, and you'll find her rapping skills aren't quite bad."
3,Not too bad....,"Not too bad for Brit's 4th album. The disc has caught the attention of my ever lovin' musical ear. ""Me Against the Music"" isn't all that bad, ""Showdown"" is awesome, ""Toxic"" is great, ""Touch of My Hand"" is another good hit. These are my favorites. All in all, the album isn't Brit's best, but these tracks that I've listed are VERY dance and club worthy (except for Touch of My Hand, but who knows)!!!"
1,she's in the drug zone alright,"I'm sick of britney spears she's going around living out her lesbian fantasdies and then wanna ride the hip hop flavor by hooking up with r kelly, and pharrell oh yeah if you can't get enough of her and madonna check out their sorry ass duet can pop music get any lamer this is garbage, along with the new christina aguilera joint and folks wonder why musiclovers are dowloading now please bring back the funk."
1,GrrRR Terrible,You don't want young kids and adolescents listening to this. It is explicit. I hate Britney spears. She can't even sing.... now she's posing nude for magazines.
1,utterless garbage,back in the day you used to have to have talent to get a recording contractthese days hell if i knowi am a true music fani love music like you people dobutto say this is music is insulting to my intelligencei am a music majorand to get a recording contract you need four of the followingqualities1. you must be able to carry a tune britney cannot whatsoever2. you must be able to play instruments britney cannot whatsoever3. you must have songwriting talents i know britney co wrote some of the songs but her song writing talent is horrific at best4. you have to have intelligence which britney does not have whatsoever she is a airhead with no brains at allmusic was good up until 1989 after that forget it i gave up!
4,"Love the music, but the voice? :-l","I must admit that the music here is boppy and addictive and I love singing along with it. But I also must admit that I think I can sing better than Britney - and that is saying something. To think that she's made the money she's made by not being able to sing? Amazing. You should check out the cd for the songs, but her voice needs a big big tune up."
1,"YOU SUCK, BRITNEY SPEARS",I HATE YOU BRITNEY SPEARS. YOU CAN'T SING. WHAT HAPPENED? YOU USED TO BE ABLE TO. I SAW THE FOOTAGE OF YOU ON STAR SEARCH WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE. YOUR VOICE WAS AMAZING AND RESONANT. NOW YOU RUN AROUND WEARING....ALMOST NOTHING AND YOU SING IN YOUR THROAT. WHAT HAPPENED???? THERE'S A REASON WHY THAT SONG IS CALLED TOXIC: WHOEVER LISTENS TO IT DIES!
3,Nothing that Special,This cd is the point in which Britney is try to change into somthing she is not. I think she should try and clean her act up a bit she is not Christina Dirty and she will never be.
1,OMG! OMG!,"Where do I begin... The music industry is so messed up right now. Band's that really sound good are passed up for this kind of junk when they should be makin the big bucks. But hey, what do I know...One more thing. To all you Britney fans out there, step back and take a look at yourself. If your a pre-teen girl who watches way to much MTV, I guess your on the right track. If your a 16 year old guy (like me),though, and your ""In the Zone"", just do yourself a favor, and step the hell out."
1,Dreck in the zone,"It's all overworked too complex electronic trip-pop, with some bland hip-hop thrown in. Ugh, the Ying Yang Twins. Britney tries to shock by talking about her sex drive, getting hot and heavy with a guy on the dance floor and about pleasuring herself. But it sounds like a little girl cursing to appall people. It doesn't sound genuine at all. The lyrics are lame, and Spears' voice sounds like a computer recording, she's so synthesized.Britney's just proven that she can't manage real music, and is creating dancepop that isn't even catchy. Want something solid by a former pop starlet? Try Mandy Moore's ""Coverage."" It's classy, beautiful, a good selection of songs and she doesn't try to shock people...."
1,Laughing all the way to the bank.,"I don't have this CD, nor will I buy anything by Britney. I have unfortunately seen her lip sync during music shows and have heard quite a few of her new songs.Britney is a marketing strategy. Her mother and management team have used Britney to make millions. I guess it worked. Well, at least Madonna can sing live. Britney sounds like Minnie Mouse with a cold.Somebody give her a box of Kleenex."
2,Not that Great,"I actually used to like Britney a lot but lately she has been bothering me. But, anyways this album isn't all that great. The only songs I actually like are ""Me Against The Music"", ""Toxic"", ""Shadow"", and ""Everytime."" The rest of the cd isn't that great. I just think that Britney sings too much about sleeping with people and that bothers me a lot. I'd rather listen to people like Hilary Duff, Ashlee Simpson, and Lindsay Lohan who at least sing about good stuff not sleeping with people."
4,great job britney,"I was never a big britney spears fan. I liked a few songs but thought her vocal abilities were limited and she was just a female backstreet boy. But I decided to give this CD a try and I was impressed with how much her music has changed for the better. I wouldn't call her a music innovator or a great vocalist, but she tried something different and the results came out great. This CD has a lot of r&b/hip hop and techno influenced tracks and beautifully written ballads. Britney's 15 minutes aren't up, she is here to stay! I wouldn't have said this 5 years ago but I'm saying it now and I'm saying go buy this CD if you want light hearted, fun pop music with an urban twist and try not to judge the person, rather judge the music"
2,"Nice try, but not good enough","Oh Britney, Britney, who's trying so hard to change her image and show her ""true"" self. It's very unfortunate that this album is not as good as her past albums, and lacks the catchiness and melody her other albums have had I also noticed she's following the recent (or popular?) trend of mixing in a Middle Eastern (and Asian) flavor to her songs. Good points for this, but nothing special in her case.Me Against the Music, Touch of My Hand, Early Mornin, Breathe On Me and Toxic are the more standout tracks. I really think the song Boom Boom is annoying because the chorus is sampled from another song. Otherwise, it would have worked. Overall, this is a mediocre album with mediocre to boring songs. For those who are curious or interested in buying this album, I recommend you sample it if possible first. Otherwise, I'd say buy Christina Aguilera's album instead."
1,Defintley not her best,"I have been a fan of Britney since ""Baby One More Time"" came out and I have loved all of her albums until this one. The album starts out great with ""Me Against The Music"" with Madonna which I love. ""Boom Boom"" is good, I like the beat. After the second track the album goes downhill and FAST. ""In The Zone"" is different from her past albums and it is good to see her doing something a little different. But this album was a complete waste of money."
5,GLORIOUS!,"Britney's new CD is an upbeat, fun CD that will get you in the mood to dance! If you purchase it, be ready to get jiggy with it!"
1,In The No Talent Zone,"She can't sing--bottom line. And her sub-Kylie Minogue posturing on every single song is forced and tiresome. She was great as a kid star and even better as a mini sex kitten, but as a ""take me seriously adult entertainer"" she just falls flat. Witness the paint by numbers execution of the first single ""Me Against The Music"" with her pseudo sex pal Madonna (another big yawn)and you get the picture. It all comes off sounding like Justin Timberlake knock-offs,and he could actually sing them better than she does here.Save your money, and buy the new Kylie cd instead....."
5,In Her Zone - Yeah!,"The Princess of Pop is now an adult. She has had to leave the rather teenage bubblegum pop and venture into the world of rather dancier pop music. She already accomplished it two years ago with ""Britney"", and has come back for more with the ""Britney Spears record from outer space"". My personal favorites are the first seven tracks, ""Brave New Girl"", ""Everytime"", the included Me Against the Music remix, and the bonus track ""The Answer"". I wish that I had the one with ""Don't Hang Up"" and ""I've Just Begun Having My Fun"", though. Britney has really shown her songwriting here: she co-wrote around 75% of the tracks in this album (shame that she didn't co-write her best hit from this album, Toxic). I wish that ""Toxic"" and ""Everytime"" became #1, though."
3,Let's go clubbin'!! Woohoo!,"This CD is definately written for the clubbing, fire-twirling, ecstacy-taking, jumpy bubbly crowd. I just wonder how much of the worlds population is like that (outside of LA). Probably about 0.001%. Which means not alot of record-sales. This is what Britney thinks is cool right now I guess. And Madonna is trying to be cool by hanging with Britney because she knows she is fading fast. Poor Britney. How could she say no to Madonna? Anyway, I bought the CD to workout to - but I still like to workout to ""Stripped"" better. Madonna - leave Britney ALONE!!! She is too nice to tell you she does NOT want you on her album."
4,Underrated,"In my opinion, I think we all need to get a grip and relise that girls become women, such as Britney. She is an artist just like Madonna and she will express herself in many ways. She is on a journey and we get to watch since she is famous. Madonna did the same thing and we all gasp, but ultimately Madonna has her fan base and so will Britney.This album has great dance music, I'm certain they will play it in many dance clubs. I think the little girls have lost interest because they can no longer relate to her, young women can since they are at similar stages. I think the album is a great pieace of Britney's expressions as she ""grows up"". I hope she finds her spot in the ground and continues to blum every year."
5,"Britney Is Back, CD is A Getter!!!","I liked Britney before, but this cd has done it's magic to love her, This album really rocks ass, the songs are all great and full of beats, My favorite is all of them!!! Britney has really grown up and sounds even better than before. Songs have this cool mid-eastern, r&b, techno, dance, and raggae sounds. This week only you can get the album for 9.99 at Best buy and Circuit city. Enjoy IT"
5,wow! cooL work...,"hey this is totally unbelivable.. Britney did a GREAT job with this album. She really got into zone..I am a big Britney fan since this ""baby one more time"" single but ""me against the music"" also rocks the beat! also she changes her styLe like not really teen pop a little bit hiphop too .. This is great and I recommend this brilliant aLbum to eveRYboDY! i love her second song in the album called i got that (boom boom) too. She is really cooL and I am telling this to all anti-brit fans : YOU ARE WRONG AGAIN because THIS IS MUSIC!!and now all you have to do is listen her songs.. you'll understand what am i talking about !..hey BriT i love you!"
2,BRITNEY PLEASE GET A LIFE,"I'M ON HERE TO SAY THAT I AM NOT A FAN OF BRITNEY SPEARS. I NEVER HAVE LIKED HER MUSIC, BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT IN THE ZONE HAS TWO GREAT SONGS. FIRST I LOVE TOXIC, SECOND EVERYTIME I THOUGHT THE SONG WAD VERY EMOTIONAL. I DO THINK TOXIC MAY WIN BRITNEY HER FIRST GRAMMY. THE SONG WAS STRONG. THE REST OF THE CDSUCKED. FIRST OF ALL SHE CAN'T SING. I HAVE TO GIVE HER CREDIT SHE IS A GREAT DANCER. I AM A XTINA AGUILERA FAN!!!!! SHE HAS AANGELIC VOICE. IN THE END SHE WILL BE THE ONE STILL STANDING.BRITNEY NEEDS TO GROW UP AND PUT HER PRIORITIES FIRST. SHES RUINING HER CAREER. SHES LOST AND CONFUSED ABOUT LIFE. TAKE SOMEADVICE BRITNEY SIGN A PRENUP.."
1,yikes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is by far the least talented person i've ever seen in my life!!!, digital oversampling crap!!, if this is the music of the future then we're in serious trouble."
5,GREAT CD TO GO BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!,"LOVE THIS CD..GREAT JOB BRITNEY! I'VE BEEN A FAN OF HERS SINCE FROM THE RELEASE OF HER FIRST ALBUM BABY ONE MORE TIME. SHE REALLY CHANGED HER STYLE AND CHANGE IS GOOD..LOVE HER NEW CD! CAN'T WAIT FOR ANOTHER ONE...SO FAR MY FAVOURITE SONGS ARE: I GOT THAT BOOM BOOM, TOXIC, SHADOW, SHOWDOWN..BUT ALL OF THEM ARE GREAT..JUST CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO IT."
1,britney spears é uma VAGABUNDA!,Além de ser ridícula e vagabunda ainda canta mal. Ela no tem voz alguma! Só sabe gemer como a CADELA que ela é!NO COMPRE E NEM ESCUTE! É UMA MERDA!
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,Save your money!!! This cd is 100% crap! Please do yourself a favor and buy yourself something nice with the 15 bucks you will save. Go buy paint and watch it dry because that will be more fun than listening to Britney Spears try to sing.
1,In the Zone - Britney Spears,"I have never posted a review before, but I had to with this one. I like Britney Spears in general, but this latest CD was a real dissapointment. Very ""clubby"", which is fine, but it gets monotonous. She has no range or self expression on this CD. It's the kind of music that is boringly generic and blasted at cheesy clubs just to get people to gyrate. Nothing special and extremely tedious, every song sounds the same. Same tempo. Same octive range. Her voice is devoured by the backround vocals (which are just as monotonous.) Whispering and moaning seem to have become her latest skill. I think she needs to stop partying and start working on something that matters."
1,Just when you thought she was cool...,"This is Britney's worst CD by far. Most of the songs are slower than her other CD's, and that means she has to SING, or whatever it is that she does. It's not a secret that Britney's voice sucks, but it really shows on this CD. Good thing I didnt' buy this CD or I would be really pissed off."
1,SHAME OF YOU BRITNEY!!!!!!!!,"I feel sorry for this confused adolescent called britney spears. Poor woman who thinks that she has talent. The only talent that she has is its body and how to showing it. She seems a squirrel singing, or moaning. Facing the reality of Britney as a huge star is totally ridiculous . She is too beautiful, but she is not an artist, she does not deserve to have a single recording. Persons like britney show that if you want to be a singer the only thing that you need is a big breast."
4,"Ready Or Not, The New Queen of Pop Is Here!","Like Cher, Madonna and Kylie Minogue before her, Britney Spears doesn't claim to be the world's greatest talent, simply a top-level purveyor of the kind of pop music that gets in your head and won't let go. She takes a big leap with ""In The Zone"", which, thanks to impeccable production and excellent collaborator choices, is thoroughly captivating from beginning to end musically.Try this song sequence for a cool pop trip:1. Me Against The Music (Rishi Rich Mix)2. Outrageous3. Breathe On Me4. The Hook Up5. (I Got That) Boom Boom6. Touch Of My Hand7. Early Mornin'8. Toxic9. Showdown10. Brave New Girl11. Shadow12. EverytimeGet off your high horse, relax and enjoy!"
3,"If Britney can sing, I'm Xtina Aguilera...music fan from USA","Ok, ""A Music Fan From The United States""... $LOL$ you should stop trying to block the bad reviews because... because of how bad this album is it will keep getting bad reviews. Britney ~thinks~ that her singing about sex graphically is going to make her more mature and ""attract a mature audience""? She couldn't be more wrong. She's not attracting young adults, she's pushing them away! What made me take these two stars off? ""Outrageous"" and ""Touch Of My Hand""... Brit, no one needs to know how outrageous your sex drive is or how you feel when you *love yourself* LOL!!! Do it in the privacy of your home all that you want, but for God's sakes, DONT SING ABOUT IT! It will only make your IMAGE more DEPLORABLE.Music fan... bad move. If you want to idolize such a bad example, go ahead."
4,i like it,"First off,I'm 16yr old male.I've always enjoyed Britney's music.She always just a lotta fun to watch and listen to.Then she made an artistic move with amazing,unique Neptunes(which have becaome a little too mainstream lately).With ""IN THE ZONE"" she's still growing artistically,but slowly.I didn't like this CD at first,now it's one of my favorite albums from 2004.This CD is actually a lot of fun to listen to,you'll enjoy it.There's some great uptempo dance hits('Toxic''Showdown'Brave New Girl').Haunting and emotional ballads('Everytime''Shadow').Hip-hop beated tracks like R.Kelly's pimpin' 'Outrageous,' and YingYang Twins 'Boom Boom.'I think the tracks that adults will favour are Moby's fabulous 'Early Morning' and impressive 'Touch of my Hand'(which are 2 of my favorites).She's written more on this album then her previous three and her writing isn't bad at all.I just think that because of her smoking her vocals are a bit rusty.Overall this CD is enjoying and I personally like it a lot."
5,HOT STUFF!!!!,This is great sexy stuff! I loved thid CD from the start to the end and there aren't any fillers at all! Quite unexpected and refreshing music. Good pop and rnb. She's worked with some good producers and people like Madonna and Ying yang twins for a great result!
3,uh.. no,"a once over of the album, and 1,589 reviews later, I still don't think she can sing. she sucks. The only reason I gave the album 3 stars is for the producers and song writers and voice altering people that made her ish presentable."
1,What a waste of money!,"OH MY GOSH! WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! People are actually calling this music?!? Wow, unbelievable! Like, what has this world come to? people are constantly mistaking garbage like this for music? My oh my, what a bunch of little poor misguided souls. From start to finish this CD is bound to sound like crap if Britney's singing, which of course she is! who told her she could sing? well whoever did, or whoever told her she had what it took to be a singer, apparently they were wrong! maybe she thought if she just showed a lot of skin she'd be really famous and to hell with how she sounds. Ughh, wrong again honey! For the love of God, please don't waste your money on this! I'm sure glad I didn't."
1,Absolutely Awful,"I enjoy music. I am not someone who dislikes Britney. I had hopes that this would be a good album. Though I was not fond of the single ""In the Zone"" I bought the album anyway. BIG MISTAKE! This album has no substance. It's not a lasting record. All the songs sound alike. The tune is bleak, with mainly a lot of Britney moaning and groaning, but not so much singing. The song ""Everytime"" is okay, though it does sound more like a 13yr olds letter written to a boy that broke her heart in jr. high.The bottom line is that this album sounds like something thats gone wrong in the club scene. Almost like she wrote it while on extacy. Not like something I'd want to hear everyday. Britany comes accross as a lost little girl who wants to be made into a woman, but isn't ready to act like ne yet."
2,Madonna Rip-Off,"Britney Spears is not the ""Madonna of our Generation"" and it becomes painfully obvious after listening to this CD. This CD is mediocre but it has its shining moments. ""Brave New Girl"", ""Breathe On Me"", and ""Touch of My Hand"" are the only songs on this CD worth listening to."
1,When She Will Learn to Sing?????,I bought this CD and and was a disaster. I can't listen to it anymore. I try to give it to my friend and he said no. This is one of the worse CD of the new SEASON. I hate this CD and I can't stand it. I waist my money! Madonna made it even worse. Guys if you like good music don't buy this CRAP.
1,"shes not a girl, not yet a singer","Other than the stellar hit 'me against the music', britney spears's new album is a disappointment. Britney tries to merge pop with hip-hop and/or techno vibes, which in this case does not sound appealing. The few ballads that she has on the album are also evidence that britney is an not a singer, as she struggles to find the right key. No amount of scandelous kisses with madonna or attention grabbing acts can create enough hype to make me want to purchase this album."
1,Pre-Packaged Hollywood Garbage,Pre-packaged Hollywood garbage. Welcome to Britneys world. Another album attempting to make her a respected music artist. To bad she is just a HACK. Hopefully her pre-teen fans will grow up and begin to appreciate real music and musicians. Having heard this album I can only say that it is nothing but a over produced album attempting to appeal to an older audience. It will never happen.
3,How does she do it,"How can someone who has no vocal talent at all keep making cds that everyone is dying to buy?? I did not buy this cd, i listened to my friend's copy. Most of the songs would be great, if there was no singing. I think i liked ""Outrageous"" the best cause the beat so awesome and it drowned out her horrible voice. When track 10 came up, I couldn't handle it...it was almost worse then that not a girl not a woman song. The only place this cd should be played is in a club with the base turned up real loud."
1,Gimme a break!,This CD is by far her worst. Not recommended unless you like listening to garbage masked as music!
1,Horible 4th Effort,"What is it about Britney Spears???How does she manage to be so successful and put out such horid music? Why do people praise her and go crazy over this stupid, ditzy,talentless skank?These questions I will never be able to answer because clearly America is enthralled by her and I think it is very very sad indeedAll I can say is if I could give this CD a zero rating I would in a heartbeat...And at least Christina Aguilera can back up her skanky image with an amazing voice..Britney is just a waste of space in the music business today..Stick to dancing hun."
4,Little girl lost--and almost found here,"Britney Spears is a pop phenomenom. Regardless of the media form she's presented in, she is no doubt one of the biggest superstars in entertainment history. Her last studio release to date, In the Zone, is an eclectic mixture of Hip Hop-infused pop. The standout here is, of course, the Grammy-winning ""Toxic,"" a track that is perfect, but other songs like ""Showdown"" and even the two ballads (the most popular being ""Everytime,"" another radio smash) show that Spears, a product of media frenzy, has the potential to bring a lot to the table if she's given the right material. Sugary sweet bubblegum classics like ""...Baby One More Time"" and ""Oops!...I Did It Again"" may have been where this babe began her music career, but it's songs like ""Toxic"" and ""Everytime"" that show where she has the possibility to go far with in the future."
4,Its a pretty good pop album.,i like how it goes from a hip hop flavor -to a trance like sound -to-rnb-to ballads. Her voice seems to sound better than it did on her last multiplatnium cd and she is now finally showing signs of maturity
2,"too bad She can't Sing,it has some decent Moments","I Bought this Set mainly for the R.Kelly Written&Produced Track ""Outrageous"" which is tight.the Ying Yang twins bring it as well.""Me against the World"" with Madonna works better for Madonna in a duet form than if She did this track Solo.if Britney could only Sing this would be a better than Avergae set.but Her voice hurts my ears.but in Her defense there has always been suspect vocalists of all eras.this is Probably the best Album She has done yet overall.She is a trip when you listen to the Lyrical content here."
3,It's O.K.,"Will all the people who give this 1 star stop saying that only stupid little kids like it? Almost all of the songs are about sex, for crying out loud! Most little kids aren't stupid. And, many older people like this music. It is not that bad.Note: I am not a little kid. I am actually a childrens' rights activist!"
2,Hmmm. Britney should dance and not sing,"I'll admit. I find many of Britneys tunes to be catchy and fun on her albums. This album is no different. However, I hate to say it but Brit should stick to dancing and not singing. Her voice sounds so artificial that it is almost insulting. No matter how beautiful a song could be, she has that trademark nasalness that continues to ruin her music. She should stick to something she has talent in, which is dancing, and stop morphing her weak voice into some wierd computer sounds."
4,It was better than what i expected it to be,"we all know that britney looks better than she can sing. i just wanted to support her because there are so few good looking singers out there nowadays. but i guess brit hired alot of people who knew their snuff. if you ever wanted to test out a britney cd, this is the one. it's not at all bubble gum pop, it's more like club music."
1,What zone?,"I know people either love Britney or hate her. I have liked some of her work in the past but this album makes it clear that she can't sing (or think for herself). It seems as if this final desperate grab for fame will either make or brake her, but I find no reason to buy into this lackluster performance.If you want sleazy and nasty but still FUN and GOOD, try listening to ""Lords of Acid"". Other artists can make being bad sound so good, But Britney is just a let down.Sorry"
5,BEST CD EVER,THIS CD IS THE BEST EVER. IT'S SO MATURE. IT HAS AMAZING BEATS.I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD BUY IT!THE SONGS ARE BEUTIFUL.BRITNEY IS THE BEST!
5,i usually don't buy britney's albums nore singles,"but this time i took time to listen to that album in the record shop and must admit that it sounds... GREAT ! forget madonna (gosh ! she's getting soooo old !) and the single me against the music, it's not the best of the album. it sounds pretty much like kylie minogue for many songs, there are rap songs, ballads with piano (sorry not my kind) but the most interesting are the songs by cathy dennis, excellent former dance singer. she also made kylie's can't get you out of my head ! so if u doubt u'll like that album, listen to showdown and toxic, both songs are absolutely great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and forget madonna, london, bad promotion, kabbala and all that stuff..... madonna influenced badly britney.AND GET THIS ALBUM NOW ! IT S EXCELLENT !!!"
5,Britney is in THE ZONE,"This is Britney Spears' fourth album, and by far her best work yet!This album is a lot more adult, but also a lot more up beat. Most of all the songs have a rich deep base rythem, and are excellent to dance to. The best songs on this album by far are: Breathe On Me (a deffinate disco/hiphop beat - to get your blood flowing), Toxic (R&B with Electric guitar licks), Outrageous (deffinate eastern tones with R&B base bumps)All in all this is the best album I've purchased todate. You won't be disappointed at all, and that's a guarantee!"
5,Brave New Britney,"I have loved Britney from the very beginning. This album is pretty different from her past stuff, but its really great!! It has something for everyone and definitely moves in a more mature direction. My personal favorites are Breathe On Me, Touch of My Hand and The Hook Up. This is a diverse CD that at first listen may be different, but is really worth giving multiple listenings to! Give it a try!!"
2,Sex sells,Britney has fully realized sex sells with her latest album. All the songs on this album speak to the hormones and not whether she really has talent. I don't think this harlet has any real talent besides her blonde hair and sexy body. What's the difference between a porno and a Britney Spears video? The porno has better music. lol
1,Britney made this CD to Worship HERSELF,"The songs on this album are ALL about Britney herself. Songs about centering herself in ""Me"" against the music, immature and stupid cheat on Justin...WHO CARES about stupid mistakes you made in your life which you constantly denied??!! Britney's fame came from the innocent/sweet image she had, and she's running out of that. I don't know why Britney forgot HOW she got famous in the FIRST Place. This whole CD has no souls in it. It really makes me sick even listening through it once. This CD will eventually go to your trash can when you clean your room<-- that I can guarantee. Why do people listen to Britney who's so conceited even produced a CD to worship herself!!!!"
3,"Not Her Best, But Some Really Great Moments","Very quickly, I did enjoy parts of ""Baby One More Time"" and ""Oops I Did It Again."" I think ""Britney"" was her best. I did enjoy her ""Greates Hits"" record. Looking ahead, ""Blackout"" had some decent moments.After her really great 3rd record, I was hoping this 4th one would be better. (Well, at least I didn't think it was.) However, that is NOT to say it didn't have some really great moments. 'Showdown' certainly has a catchy sound. 'Breathe On Me' is different, but interesting. 'Toxic' takes an aspect of the human condition and reveals it for what it can be. 'Outrageous' has a nice energy to it. 'Shadow' is a great song and a strong contender for the best one on the record.So while my favorite remains her excellent 3rd record, this 4th one certainly has its great moments."
1,Britney's album Stinks!!!!,"I do admit her song ""Toxic"" is catchy, and her song ""Everytime"" is nice, but other than those two songs, the album is boring and the songs are horrible. ""Me Against the Music"" stinks and I hate it. ""Boom Boom"" is the most horrifying, annoying, pathetic song I've ever heard in my life! There is no point to that song except for yelling out words on the off beat. ""Early Morning"" also has no point to it but I believe it is definitely better than ""Boom Boom"". I am done with this review, and though there are two good songs I like, I believe a good album needs at least 6 out of ten songs that are good. Britney's album just doesn't have that. Sorry all you Britney fans, but she stinks!"
1,"A little bit older, and a little more wiser...","At first I followed Britney. Then she took her break and I took mine. When I heard this ablum, I realized, this girl can't really sing. I mean, she has talent, but she really can't sing. I have never really heard her sing from deep down. Her tunes are catchy, but that's it. No meaning, no feeling. The only reason she is a pop princess is for her looks. Her voice is less than mediocre. At least Jessica Simpson and Xtina can sing. Give it a try Britney! You might just become a singer! You let me down :-("
2,The Worst Ever!,"I have been a fan of Britney Spears since her first album but this new Album called In the Zone is just terrible! The music is all different types and not many of them even have a good tune for them either. I like the Song In the Zone and Toxic but that's about it. The rest is crap, never heard such a bad CD like this from Britney before. I may not be buying anymore of her CD's if this keeps up in the future. It was a big disappointment for me too because I requested this CD for Christmas, only to find out, it wasn't half as good as I had expected in the end. Two thumbs down from me, don't waste your time with this one unless you like a CD with no general format of music. If you do then buy it because it has R&B, Hip-Hop, Rap and so forth on here. But for me its just not organized and its not very enjoyable to listen to due to that big mistake right there."
2,Zero vocal talent.,"If you are looking for an album with some whispering lyrics and lots of background noise - this one is for you. There is not an element of vocal talent on this entire album. Synthesizers and oh, ah and uh is all you will really hear. I certainly don't recommend this and really it just proves to me that image is often everything in the music biz."
5,Great zone!,"This is one great CD!!!Since I've always hated Britney, I never bought the CD until I listened to my friend's. I loved it at once and asked her whether she'd lend it to me but she said she can't stay a day without listening to it. I bought it and I don't regret it.One-star reviewers are missing it all out because they obviously haven't listened to it.This is a great dance CD and I actually liked Everytime. I can't stand ballads but I love this one and I do hope Justin listens to it. I know Britney did one one him but she's sorry now.I can't imagine she wrote the lyrics because I always pictured her to be this dumb blonde. She's great and got talent. She's an awesome entertainer and I love all her new songs.I guess Britney manages somehow to capture fans and anti-fans through this album. I'm definately a fan now and I'm gonna stay in the zone.It is not a waste of maney and whoever said it was are just trying to bring down a good album because they're jealous of how successful it became."
3,"Only a few good songs, not worth $$","The beats are not that great and the only good songs to me are #4, #5 and #8...all the rest are just lame. Most will probably be dissapointed"
1,just horrible,This is a horrible album by a horrible singer. The only reason it's even remotely listenable is the magic done by producers to mask Britney's horrendous voice. Mandy Moore has more talent in a fiber of hair.
1,NOT IN THE ZONE,"I admit it, i bought the CD. It is anything but in the zone. i like the beats and the music but britney cannot sing. she is an amazing performer, she always puts on a good show and offers a lot for the stage but her singing...sucks! Shes got millions i suggest she invest in some vocal lessons"
4,I'm not a fan but I liked it,"but I can honestly say that britney has finally released a solid, creative album. Her voice isn't good, but the quality of music this time around makes up for it. Maybe the long break she took paid off, she should try that more often and continue making good albums like this one. And her music videos are establishing her as a music video artist as well, keep it up britney, best of luck in the future."
5,Everyone is completley different so dont read others reviews,First off there is no doubt that this album is way different than any of Britney's other albums and like every single ablum some songs are better than others and some songs are worst than others. Have u ever listened to an album and liked every song alike? This is a good album and Britney has worked hard on it. I like every song except for i wish the ballad everytime was more vocal. Who cares what other buyers write in their comments. Every person is different and theres no way to tell if u like this album or not unless u buy it. I am not saying u will like it though and im not saying u wont. But its cool and every song is completley different than the other. I am definatley a britney lover but u dnt have to be. Just spend the lousy 15 bucks or so and try it out.
3,nice effort,"Britney always had catchy tunes though her voice was always annoying, and her tunes all sounded like parodies of one another. That changed with Me Against the Music. Her voice is still not the greatest, but the music has changed, for the better. She's explored more styles of music. Highlights on the album are Toxic, Me Against the Music, Shadow, Brave New Girl, Touch of My Hand and the wonderful Outrageous, which was written by R Kelly.Even if you hate britney's guts, give this album a chance and you just might change your mind"
1,In The Trash,"Give me a break, this media tramp has nothing to offer musically and the only thing showcased is her own ambition and desperation on this CD. A good barometer of how good an artist(and B.S. hasn't a clue what that is) can be defined on how they market their work. If the music were any good would you really need to ""expose"" yourself? Wouldn't you trust your musical instincts and let the music speak for itself? Well, duh, B.S. has no musical instincts and those of you who continue to prop up this lame excuse for talent in a lifestyle of the rich and shallow are the real losers."
1,Not Enough,"This CD is forgettable, except for ""Toxic"" and ""Brave New Girl"", but still, a CD with 2 'Ok' songs doesn't make a good CD."
1,where is her own talent ?,"sure, she is famous. but she never wrote one single song in four albums. maybe a couple co/writing. but by real musician standars, that is sad. and why in gods name can't she sing live. i have only seen her sing one song live. everything else is lip syncing. i know she has all those dance moves to perform, but x-tina and madonna do that and sing. brit's voice is just soo weak, she never sings high notes, she never ""belts"" out a tune, not even on studio tracks. i won't say the songs aren't fun and bubble-gummish. but they are not meant to be rock classics. really once you grow up , you will get rid of her cds, embarassed that you ever owned them."
4,Better Than What I Expected,"I got this album from a friend, as a gift...And I thought that this album was empty, cuz' honestly, she has small talent in music, her vocal abilities are much less than what Xtina's or Jessica's ( her main rivals )I rate this album 4 because there are some songs that are great 4 me.., and I think I can't live w/o those songs..well. there are still some songs that are like a rubbishshe famous more bcuz of her sex appeal instead of her vocal abilitiesBut I'm happy to know that she has found her talent and vocal abilities that she'll show and proove it on her upcoming album that will be release late this year or early 2007( I read this info from the internet )Can't wait 4 her 'comeback'..., actually not so.. >,<"
2,What is she mumbling?,"I've always liked Britany, but this album doesn't show off her talent. You can't even make out her words. Britany was showcased fine before. Now she's branching out. She should at least make sure her lyrics are clear enough to understand. She has talent but she's trying to be fresh again like her friend Madonna's probably mentioned to her. Only she's forgeting the basics of selling her work. Though I never liked Madonna's vanity videos, you could always make out her words. In case anyone's offended my earing was checked for perfect recently. I still like her performances just not this."
1,Worthless mind Garbage,"Britney Spears is a joke to society. her music is as unoriginal as her image. She has no business even having records let alone ""singing"".i would rather stab pencils in my ears than listen to this joke of a musician."
1,Huge Disappointment,What was she thinking!!!??? This CD basically goes from bad to worse. Most of the tracks on the CD are a huge disappointment the only ones really worth listening to are Me against the music and Everday. If you want my opinion buy Stripped (Christina Augilera) instead!
3,MMMMMMMMMMMMM..........................I don't know.....mmmm,"Ok the only songs worthy of buying (so far I've only listened to 1-6)are Me against the music, toxic, and Showdown. Maybe it is worth $14.00 or $15.00? Is it???"
1,AWFUL!,By far the worst so far. Guess she is really running out of ideas and trying her hardest to keep afloat. I don't see her being around much longer! She is just played out and looks can only take you so far when you are lacking in the talent department.
2,"Surprise, not","This CD is bland, all of the songs are about the same exact thing, lets go clubbing ... no real emotion into it. Britney should start writing because although the writers she has do a very good job, she has very little variety in the songs she does choose. I gave it two stars because when I listened to it, a song actually caught my attention, ""Toxic"", and I fell in love with it after awhile. The other star came out of, She actually collaborated! I was expected way more since she ""took time off to make this one good,"" but I guess I look at Stripped by Christina Aguilera(One of the best CDs ever by a female artist, in my opinion). I do not disrespect her or dislike her at all, but if she's going to be the next Madonna, she's got to get into Madonna's shoes and reinvent herself."
3,she needs 2 slow DOWN!!,"I think if all britneys cds didnt have so much to do with sex, and loving someone, she could make some more $$$$. I have her 1st 3 cds and most of the songs are ok.On her 3rd CD her song BOYS was way 2 much. Im afraid to let my mom listen 2 it.I usted 2 luv britney but now i kinda like contempary christian music now."
1,Britney Fading Alway!,Britney should be more serious about singing and learn the art of siging. She can't sing even with the help of eletronic stuff and voices behind. Her producer is making a lot money selling to lost TEENS. CRAP like this only TEENS and people don't know about music buy. The DESPERATE Madonna tries the survive her fading career singing with Briteny and even giving a her a LESBIAN kiss. Britney should get mature and Madonna must learn she is not a GIRL anymore at 46. Don't buy this CD because you will waist your money.
1,"Girls, Be Honest And Ask Yourself Before Buying This Cd","Would i buy this if she was fat, wore, glasses and had braces."
1,IS THIS BRITNEY OR A MUPPET SINGING ???,"If she is a singer I want to be a singer too. I know that I don't have any talent, but she does not have it neither. I completely sure that everyone sing better than her after listening this piece of garbage. I feel really offended with this cd, how her company allows britney to did this cd? The US lawS should prohibit this cd, it is so awful that it can be considered environmental contamination."
2,Totally Disapointing....,"This cd is basically a disgrace to ALL Britney fans. As a far-away liker of Britney Spears from the beginning, I was appalled! This pop/techno cd is unlike any other Britney album. ""In The Zone"" has some good songs like ""Toxic"" and ""Everyime"", but the rest aren't really worth your 13 dollars. The songs on ""In The Zone"" are very selfish and over-sexy( It's super hard to be OVER-SEXY, but she pulled it off!)Most of the songs on the album sound like they're a computer or a back-up singer.If you need a dance song or etc., look here. But if you want a true Britney album, I suggest her Greatest Hits: My Perogative or Oops, I Did It Again!, some true hits."
2,Sigh...,"Now, in my opinion, Britney Spears started out as a wonderful artist, and it all went down hill from there. I have no problem that she ""matured"" and started singing different material, but her voice just turned sour.I do love ""Everytime;"" it totally rocks. ""Toxic"" is so bad it's good, and every other song on the album in pretty bad.Sorry if you enjoyed this album, but I say you can do better."
2,I can't wait to become famous...,"Every time my sister plays this disc, she puts on her skimpiest outfits and BECOMES Britney...her pure energy, ""saavy"" style, and gyrating hips. Not so innocent hun...But girlfriend, Britney Spears rocks for one reason only. What's that? Well, I have no talent, but her music has taught me that I don't need it to become famous. Buy this CD now!Hopefully, one day Britney will pair up with say, Kathleen Hanna, and give dear Britney a few lessons on what REAL lesbians do.And if you like Britney Spears, try listening to Ashlee Simpson. Yes, that sweetheart kid-sister of Jessica Simpson. She has this really cool reality show on MTV that focuses on her rise to a career of super-stardom...even though she hasn't done anything yet!"
4,Surprising! Better than the last one....,"I have to admit, I was having my doubts about this new record from Britney. The last album was good, but you could tell she was hitting a dry spell. She did the right thing by taking some time off, and getting some new producers and writers. ""Me Against The Music"", ""Shadow"", ""Outrageous"", and ""Brave New Girl"" are all standouts here. Britney's voice is getting a lot better. She still needs work, but I think she has what it takes to stay around awhile if she takes a few hints from her mentor and idol, Madonna. Stay fresh, Britney! Keep changing your sound from time to time...and the pop world will remain your domain! :)"
1,This is music?,"It's amazing that Britney Spears continues to make so called ""music"". She has no talent, she can't sing. Yes she can dance, but that's not enough to save her. She is an empire, and there are very smart people that keep her in the public eye, which helps her get attention and the constant talk around the water cooler each day. But when it comes down to the music, what is there? Nothing. There is absolutely no substance on this album. This isn't real music, can you honestly hear any real instruments on the album? No because its all synthesized and overproduced. Anyone could have made this album, and a lot of people could have made this a better album than she did. She wants to show she's all provocative and edgy, but she's not. Every album she has this new image, and she completely contradicts herself. Honey, concentrate on making real music that means something, cause this is nothing but a mess."
1,"Bad CD, Bad Singer and now a Bad Scandal","Beside being a bad singer and put out a TERRIBLE CD, Britney now is trying to put up the bad sales of her CD with a new IMATURE SCANDAL. If want to know about IMATURITY contact Britney. I wish she could read my review. This CD is HORRIBLE and a wast of MONEY."
1,The girl can't sing!,"Britney belongs in Vegas as a show girl! She can strut her stuff, but she can't sing. If you watch the videos I'm sure many are taken with her. But if you listen to the CD with no Britney in site it's terrible!"
1,ying yang twins and madonna? She's so in the zone....with madonna lmao,"I had a crush on a chick that liked this cd....then i found out how she was....hmmm oh yeah slut! anyway yeah garbage good thing i never considered buying or downloading any of her music....oops she did it again create a garbage. Oh and to add on for my not so well absent minded avril lavigne fan. ""which sucks"" she bought the cd and got spyware on her computer.....thanks again britney!!!P.S: Another girls gone wild britney and madonna....lmao"
2,SHE CANNOT SING,"OK, i think Britney is beautiful and is a VERY VERY tallent dancer... but her music... its horrible. The only song worth listening to on this C.D is ""Everytime"" but when she sang it live on SNL she sounded like she was having trouble, she was breathing after every other word. Myself being a singer, i have a wide range of what i consitter tallented, when it comes to her voice... she has none. I'm sorry sweet heart, you seem like a very nice girl- but stick to dancing."
1,YOU CALL THIS MUSIC?!?!,I wish there's an option for 0 stars. This is one of the worst albums ever made...an artist that capitalizes on sex to hide the fact that she cannot sing. The awkwardness of some of these songs just makes you want to put your hands over your ears and scream no more! Don't waste your time or money on this!!!
2,Dee,"This CD did not live up to all the media hype. I only liked 2 or 3 songs. She basically moans, groans, purrs,...does everything BUT sing through the whole CD. She needs to show us her vocal ability. Her previous 2 CD's were alot better...huge disappointment."
4,Best CD so far,"I consider Britney to be a girl with vocal and performing talents. Some things she did in the past, I liked: ('Stronger', 'Born To Make You Happy', 'Boys'), but her albums were often with too much fillers.When she's in the right hands with good material and a good producing team, she can do things that sets her apart from the rest. And this CD is the evidence of that.Although I don't like every song, there is plenty of convincing stuff on this CD.I find 'Toxic' the best track of the album. Musically speaking a sort of ELO meets surf rock.'Early Mornin' is another great track. 'Outrageous' is good, but sounds a bit too much like 'Addictive' (Thruth Hurts).All'n all, with this CD Britney is moving up to the same league where Madonna and Kylie Minogue reside. So that is surely a big leap forward for Britney."
5,britney is cool,people say britney cant sing but she can people who hate britney always say that because they hate her well let me tell you somthing you try and sell over 70 mil records and be an icon. the Album is GOODJaner OSMAN london fan
2,Yuck!,"Ok, so miss Spears wrote a more grown up CD. So what? Does that make it any better? No! She still sucks. Although I must admit that she did get me temperarely hooked on Toxic, I soon found out thats what it is, Toxic. With her annoyingly high voice and futuristic editing I don't know what she was thinking! Not that her video was any better. Yes, I admit, her album is different from the others, but that does not mean it's any better. You've heard enough of this CD on the radio, no need to go out and buy it. It's a total waste of money. This is also the most inappropriate album for young kids. The lyrics are completly filthy."
4,Pretty Damn Good,"This is one of Britney's better albums, and leads her in a whole new, more adult direction. ""Breathe on Me"" is a really sexy dance track, and Shadow is interesting in a slower way. All in all, I will be listening to it non-stop for at least a week, and it is the perfect soundtrack for getting ready to go out and have a good time."
1,Worse and worse every year,"Eventually she'll be sooo bad, she'll fall off the face of the earth completely and all will be well again."
2,It's over!!,"Her Career is over, my friends. She's trying to do her best (and whatever it takes!) to get back in track but she lost it a long time ago. Her 15 minutes of fame are done and gone. That she is a multimillionaire young woman? Yeah, she is. That she still has a big fan audience? Yeah, she has. But that's about it! Her big glitter spotlight splendor is down in flames. Bye, Britney."
1,Couldn't be worse,Quite possibly the worst recording in the history of recorded music. Embarrassingly bad. Actually makes Madonna seem talented.
4,BETTER THAN ALL THE REST!!,"This c.d. is definitley her best out of all the other ones. This one she sounds more mature and relaxed. Not everyone has to sound like Christina Aguilera or Mariah Carey to make it in the music industry, and obviously tons of people adore Britney because she has been making albums. I really like the ballads on here, she shows more of an adult side to her rather than the typical love song like she used to sing when she first bursted onto the scene. I really like this c.d. and hopefully she'll make plenty more!"
4,Mildy impressed,"Toxic and Everytime are about the only decent Songs on this album...I really like Britney...I really do, but she could have just dont better on this album. I liked her ""Britney"" album, and its still in my CD player to this day..Love Ya Britney...But try harder next time..."
5,Dam good dance album..,"No words to say! But this is Miss spears best album ever. I just bought it, GO BRITNEY!!!! hit me up, ONLY if you agree too!"
4,Pretty Good,"This album was a total surprise I didn't think it was gonna be this good. Good songs and great beats.Me Against the Music- 6/10 Good song for first singleI've Got That (Boom Boom)- 7/10 Good beatShowdown- 4/10 Not a good songBreathe On Me- Good beat to itEarly Mornin'- 3/10 An okay song but gets boring!Toxic- 7/10 Good but gets badOutrageus- 9/10 One of the best songs on the album!The Hook Up- 10/10 My favorite song on the albumShadow- 8/10 Nice Ballad, it makes you wanna hear again and againBrave New Girl 5/10 The beginning was okay, but when the chorus comes thats when it get pretty badEverytime- Good, Britney was asked in an interview if this song was for Justin......maybe it was"
2,She still can't sing,"It might be the girl's 4th album, but some songs, literally made me want to cry, and no not from emotion, but from the fact that Britney sounds like a dying dried out old goat in heat.The melodies and beats, in some songs are nice and catchy . I loved the melody in ""Touch of my hand"" with a little asian sounds, and ""toxic"" that sounded like some techno western music, really rocked, but her raspy voice cannot reach many notes, and ruines pretty much anything she sings. Actually her attempt to ""sing"" is blasphemy! It's like calling processed cheese food, provolone cheese, or comparing spam to brisket.Britney is trully an intersting mutation of a female zygot, but she ain't a singer."
1,A VERY POORLY MADE ALBUM.,"This album is even worse than the horrible britney album.The album is a true disaster because she tries to incorporate too many different styles of music which simply does not work.All the songs were simply boring and her vocals are mediocre like always.Yet again she is trying to sell her image on cover and by writing x rated and nasty lyrics.She believes that everyone is buying into her bull,especially naive little girls.If I was a parent I would not allow my kids to be listening to this very poor role model.BE WARNED.You will not like this garbage!!!"
4,Exactly what I wanted and Expected! Go Girl!,"First of all, we all know that Brit was not going to come out with the greatest album of the century. We got what we expected and wanted, a fun group of dance songs to play in the living room and jump around to. Nothing that will make us think too hard, but will induce some singing along and shaking of the bootie. It's halarious that people get all worked up about the music, its not about the music, its about the hair, the beats, the videos, the stories...it's about Britney."
3,Britney Spears - In The Zone (Dual Disc),"Ok, I got this dual disc about a week ago and I find it sortof ok! The dvd audio 5.1 is much better sound quality so, I would advice you to get that but for a collectors item like myself then its well worth it. The menus are pretty hip and stylish which is a good postive thing. You get 2 music videos on the dual disc. Which is good to look back over but the greatest hits dvd/cd is out so all the hits are on it.Buy it if you can't find the dvd-audio or buy it if you want/need it as a collectors item but don't buy it if you just want a dual disc ;)!"
4,Pretty darn shocked,"I am NOT a fan of Britney Spears, but after I heard 'Toxic' I got this CD, and it is not overwhelmingly great, but it is fantastic dance music! I was pretty surprised at how much I enjoyed this CD! I may not be a fan of Britney, but I am a big fan of ""In The Zone""!"
1,Bottled Blond Kiss,"At first when I heard here Me Against the Music song, I thought it would be okay. But then I remembered all the stuff about her kissisng Madonna. Also here video for that song was really gross. The end was just like on stage. Although Britney did kiss Madonna, I kind of have simpathy for her. Nothing ever came up about Madonna kissisng Christina. Well, I found the picture of Madonna kissing Christina the same night she kissed Britney. Plus, all the songs on her cd are really babish. They all sound as if she were eleven years old. Sorry Britney but after hearing about the Playboy thing and crap, I was just a bit grossed out. She'll be out of business before you know it."
4,Fun Party CD,"While Britney's voice is not amazing, her tracks are well produced and this makes up for any ability she lacks. I enjoyed this album because it has a little of everything from trance to pop to 80s electronica.""I got that Boom boom"" rocks because the guest rappers with a twangy country guitar make for a cool and original mix.""Breathe"" is another steller song. It is trance-like, Britney's voice sounds very seductive, and it is destined to be a club hit.""Toxic"" is already stuck in my head after a day because of its catchy chorus.""Everytime,"" the ballad of the cd, is a touching slow song with only a piano and a music box as background. Though it sounds cheesy, Britney's feelings really show through on this one.I am glad I bought this album and I enjoyed it more than any of Britney's previous albums. It is more mature and you can tell that every song has carefully planned with lots of different elements included, such as violins, banjos, computer altered voices and more."
3,Blue Jean Fantasy - Not what I was hoping for.,I was hoping for younger guys and some kind of sex action. Not what this movie is about. It's about Blue Jeans and relationships. NO THANKS!
5,Summary,"A young man confused about his sexuality meets a handsome stranger and finds himself tempted by the opportunity, but he is not yet ready to follow his heart. Scenarios of erotic fantasy mark his journey to self-acceptance. These fantasies are triggered by the blue jeans the handsome stranger left behind as a parting gift."
3,"Nice to see An Old Classic come back to life,But Better!","During the last couple of years I've seen repeats on t.v. of the old show of ""Davey and Goliath"",which I loved as a kid"" and thought it was too bad that tv was soo Sexist back in 1970's and '60s. I believe ,especially in these violent and self-centered days, America and the world need to have more friendly religious messeges! So many Christian people today seem so bigoted & self righteous and go giving out their version, often misguided messeges, of Christianity.I totally think shows like these need to help bring people together. Also, I suggest viewing the ""Vegetable Tales""videos."
1,Multiculturalism Nonsense,"Snowboard Christmas could have been wonderful, given the theme, but the message is pure liberal propaganda. The plot and dialog are unnaturally subservient to political correctness. All beliefs and genders are equal. The predetermined ending becomes obvious about ten minutes into the story. Remakes are generally bland, and this one sure is. A big disappointment is the voice of Goliath. Oh well, we live in Orwellian times."
2,"""All religions are equal"" message","If you are not a Christian parent, this review is not for you.I know there are many out there who would be pleased with the ""all religions are equal"" message of this DVD. However, I also know that many Christian parents (like me) will not want this message conveyed to their children.As a Christian, I believe that, yes, God loves all people, but not that all religions lead to the true God.Aside from that, the look of the production is excellent -- much better than the old ones."
3,Interesting but average,"Code: Selfish is one of The Fall's more obscure albums from the early 1990s. The first track, Birmingham School Of Business, has a complex structure with churning guitar patterns; Free Range has a faster driving beat, while Return is a hypnotic number with interesting synth and guitar interplay. Time Enough At Last is closer to traditional rock, as is Everything Hurtz with its urgent beat and almost punk feel. Immortality has a chugging beat and Just Waiting has some delicious jangling guitar parts. Gentleman's Agreement is a gentle rock ballad, and Married, 2 Kids is a type of mid-tempo story song with jazzy touches. The problem is the lack of really gripping songs. None of them remains in the mind after repeated listens. Shift-Work is the only other Fall album that I'm familiar with, and I like it more than Code: Selfish which is not a brilliant album but does offer enough of this band's inimitable genius to please the fans and satisfy those who love idiosyncratic rock."
5,book of the beginnings part 1,"product was a gift, the person enjoy reading odds books. he was so grateful for the books that i gave him."
4,Useful Book,"Useful book for anyone, who is familiar with the experts series.. Contains very useful information and inside tips from the various college defensive backfield coaches. You feel yourself as you are in a clinic when reading this book. Well, all the articles are taken from the coaches clinic records, maybe that's why..Unfortunatelly, the graphics and schemes are not well-prepared."
4,easy way to help doggie's joints,"Force-feeding my dog glucosamine tablets got old pretty quickly. I bought a nice bag of these biscuits and the whole problem went away. Based on my dog's size (90 lbs), my vet recommended 1000 mg of glucosamine -- just 2 biscuits a day.Almost all of the biscuits arrived whole and they stay fresh in the sealable bag.These definitely aren't gourmet treats so if your dog is finicky, you may want to use caution; mine ate them up with no problem."
5,A story...,"Our four dogs love these.It appears that these no longer get put into a plastic bag before being put into the box. This allows all sorts of mishaps.The first box we got this way had mostly broken bits and appeared to be stale. (No, the puppies did not complain)Amazon.com send out a replacement box. This one was full of little bugs. Grose. It got tossed into the trash. (Puppies were sad...)So I called the company, spoke to a very nice person who said they would look into it, and get back to me.Less then a week later, a box arrived, and in it were four 6lbs bags of these treats! These 6lbs bags are heavy duty and re-sealable.Although I am not sure why they do not seal the 20lbs boxes as they used to, the company did a very nice CS fix, and I will continue to support them by buying the 6lbs bags."
2,"I'm not entirely sure it does what it says it does, but...","My dog doesn't really like these very much. (...and really...what is the point of it coming in biscuit form if you practically have to force-feed it to your dog?...) I am also not really confident it does what it says. There may be some issue with my dog absorbing the nutrients from these. I switched to a different product after a few months of him not liking these and I noticed very rapid improvement in his joints and mobility within a few weeks! Obviously, this is not anything I would buy again...ever."
2,Whispers,"Lives in the past and present intersect in Diablo Springs. Gracie Beck has returned to solve a family mystery and curse, just as Reilly Alexander re-enters her life. Seventeen years have passed since they saw one another, and now, to break that old curse, the issues between them have to be settled. Long ago, two other lovers met a tragic end, and that fact has haunted Gracie's family ever since. Now, the time has come for that to be changed.** Seesawing back and forth between the two times and first and third person POV, this comes off as an uneven, disjointed effort. Reilly seems to be an interesting character, but is lost in a flat world. **Amanda Killgore"
5,I love Cinnamon,"""Maybe in the Next Life"" is one of the coolest songs I have ever heard; just hauntingly beautiful, truthful, and sad. The rest of the album is just as good. If they are reading this, I hope they will make a new record."
4,"Govinda travels through Sikkim, Central and Western Tibet & Kailash, with emphasis on Tibetan Buddhism teachings and traditions","Kind of an autobiography, Govinda's recount his travels through Sikkim, Central and Western Tibet, relying heavily on Tibetan Buddhism teachings and traditions. Over half of the book deals with his spirituality and learning from his guru. There are 28 pages describing Kailash and the kora - absolutely excellent! He then travels to Tsaparang, describing his stay and the temples in 31 pages."
1,"Great sound, poor build quality","I've now had four pairs of these phones (primarily because nothing else is available that works). They have great sound when they don't slip out of your ear canal (how wonderful if they had some way to keep them from ripping out of your ear canal during a flip-turn or push off). My chief complaint is that they all fail w/in about 3 weeks of use (I swim about 3000m a day, five days a week). Dissecting them shows that the internal cables are hair-thin and have all broken from metal fatigue. I've even tried reinforcing the cable at points where it bends (near the jack) with electrical tape, but that just moves the fatigue point to the end of the reinforced point. Come on folks, use decent cabling."
2,Difficult to keep in the ears,"The Otterbox waterproof case I ordered with these works great. I have a difficult time keeping these in my ears while I am swimming. After the sound stopped coming out a one side (only after 10 laps), I just concentrating on keeping the other side in my ear until a couple more laps when that side also stopped working. I let them dry while I did a few more laps. I was able to get them to work again, but it was just too much of a hassle. The sound quality was good when I was able to keep them in my ears and when they were working."
2,Waterproof earphones,These plugs do not last very long because they only stay waterproof for a little over a month.
2,Disappointment,"I purchased this book for a 13 year old writer and was very disappointed. While the book may be useful for writers several years younger than her, much of what was covered in its pages is taught in late grade school and early middle school classrooms. Chapters that do hold potential--such as the one on revising--still fall short of what they could provide (particularly if your writer already revises and has others review his or her work). If you are at the point of trying to find guides and writing resources for a budding young writer, the child is probably already beyond most of what this book has to offer. If you are looking for an introduction to the very basics of dilogue, points of view, rising action, and character, this book is probably a good buy."
3,Good until the Dissapointing Ending,"Very good and informative, until the last chapter (getting published). It is so discouraging to think all the way when you are reading it ""I can write, and maybe get a book published!"" and then get put down. My personal view is that that chapter should be left out. But the other chapters are very good for a child grades 4-7."
2,Disappointing fare,"This 1994 collaboration came to me used, via a friend, which I read primarily because it was available when I needed a book in hand quickly (can't be caught without reading material, now can we?). Much as I like Mercedes Lackey, this is not a book I would have bought, due to the Piers Anthony influence. I found the characters superficial, with a cumbersome and contrived sexual situation, more typical of Anthony than Lackey. I have ceased reading Anthony over the years, feeling that he has been almost a caricature of himself and extremely formulaic. I was not too surprised to discover that Lackey developed an idea/outline of Anthony's, which he then edited and added 10,000 words. I suspect I know the pages he added: there's a lot of telling, not showing, of characters' thoughts and emotions. The world is not uninteresting, and might make an intriguing role-playing game, but that's not enough to carry the book. There's lots more good fantasy out there; pass this one by."
2,Disapointing,"I love Mercedes Lackeys Valdemar and Piers Anthonys Xanth Series, but this book was not up to those standards. It started out all right in an interesting new setting, but even ideas that could have been breath taking suffered from the lack of personal involvement of me the reader of the book. Personally in retrorespect I think that those two authors are incompatible."
2,Read Spencer's A Brother's Price instead!!!,"This book was recommended to me by someone who saw I liked Wen Spencer's A Brother's Price, as having a similar setting. In Spencer's fantasy novel women lead the society, women are the soldiers and farmers, it is matrifocal, while men raise the children. Men are rare and highly valued, as a result. Spencer's book is light and fun and the oldest brother, who is about ready to be married off, has adventures. READ THAT BOOK!!!This one one has a 16 year old girl Xylina, a magic user as the narrator. Faro (or Ware)would have been better choices. It's better storytelling to read the POV of the underdog than the Alpha Dog. Especially when the Alpha Dog whines as much as this one does. And goes through nonsensical changes."
1,Bad to boring to ugh,I thought Anthony went down hill with the Fractal mode books and here he puts it into overdrive. Perhaps the authors have too different of styles. Perhaps the first part is too whiny. Perhaps the second part is too boring. But it all adds up to a waste of time and effort.
3,Entertaining read,"I have read several books by both authors, and have enjoyed their fare. I love Ms. Lackey's Elemental Masters series and Mr. Anthony's Incarnations of Immortality series, and this book is a decent collaborative effort between the two. It's not the best that either of them have written, but is still a fun and decent read, I rate it at 3.5/5 stars (too bad you can't give half-stars when you're asked to choose how many stars)The premise is entertaining, and this society certainly is interesting, but I found the idea of other societies with different rules to be a bit out of place here, due to the magical rules, which just felt conflicting and contrived to me. If the rules of this world had been tweaked a bit and more better thought out, the story would have been more believable. If you like Piers Anthony or Mercedes Lackey, you may enjoy this book - just don't have *grand* expectations."
4,Looks like I'm in the minority here,"Okay, I'll admit it. I enjoyed this book. Of course, I was seventeen when I read it, but I enjoyed it. Having read both Anthony and Lackey and not really enjoying either author consistently, this book came as a surprise. I could easily recognize both Anthony's ""punny"" sense of humor and Lackey's tendency towards either big/dumb/brawny or gifted/gay/enslaved male characters. That the demon Ware was really neither charmed me. Although there were some plot discrepancies, and the ending left much to be desired, I enjoyed this book. But be warned: there isn't much character development here. Xylina goes from being the original Gabrielle to Xena right back to the original Gabrielle at the end of the book. Ware in essence doesn't change, and Faro stays the same obedience-of-a-well-trained-dog slave. Like I said, it was an enjoyable read-when I was seventeen and less discerning."
1,"Disappointing, Convoluted and just plain irritating","So, I read the back of a potentially good book co-written by an author I was fond of (Until I read Fractal Mode, anyway). Great! Then I read it. It started off so well. Descriptive and successful at portraying a different society, a different world. The Demon was even interesting to me as a part of the plot, until the relationships went into this odd three-way. Stupid plot twist, just irritating. Couldn't they make up their minds? What's it got to do with the story? But that's not why I didn't like the book. By the time it GOT to that plot point, I was already bored and completely unsympathetic with the characters. Don't waste your time, just go read Dune again, but if you have to have sex, Piers Anthony goes out of his way to have nubile pre-teens go after it with adult men. Guy's got problems."
1,If I Pay Thee Not In Gold,"While this book started out promising it managed to lower my high esteem of the two authors by a notch. The book takes place in a world where women rule through illusion. One of the women risks everything for a man. The book has the makings of a intriguing story, with both inner and outer conflict. Unfourtunatly everything ends suddenly with an unsatisfactory plop. It appears that the authors became tired of their project and so wrapped it up quickly hoping the reader wouldn't notice."
3,Disappointing!,"A huge fan of Misty's books, I snatched this one off the shelf when I saw it. I was disappointed, though. _If I Pay Thee_ is definitley not up to the standard that I've come to expect from Ms. Lackey or Mr. Anthony. It began good, with a refreshing setting that could have really gone somewhere. But, it didn't. The characters were underdeveloped and resisted the reader's sympathy, and the storyline was sluggish. I keep my faith in Misty's books, though. This was definitley out of the ordinary."
3,Essay's 3 and 4 much better ...,"What is creativity? I owe an apology to Audio Scholar for my first review. I should have finished listening to the whole whole audio novel before saying anything the whole work. My first review only pertains to essay 1 on tape 1. After abandoning the first tape because of unpredicted content I continued with tape 2 and was pleasently surprised with an engaging discussion on the philisophical nature of creativity and the human condition. One of my favorite readers, Jeff Riggenbach, read the last of the four essays. I would still like the audio book redeveloped to have more emphasis like the content contained in essay's 3 and 4. Arnold D Veness"
1,Not Enough,"There is not enough information on this video, especially compared to the DVD. Seems to me it is just a sales pitch, nothing more.Not even enough for a single star."
3,"Redesign, please!","These bar end caps do indeed complete the ""look"" of your rack system, but they fall out waaaay too easily. They need a redesign so that they fit securely into the bar ends. As is now, they can simply be brushed and they can fall out. I bought this set as a replacement set."
4,It is what it is.,"It's an OEM replacement to the thule end caps. If you lost yours, these would be a replacement. Tight and snug fitting and finished the rails off."
4,Impressive,"Not usually one to listen to brutal death metal in recent times, I had heard things about this band having incredible speed and brutality. After downloading a song from Century Media, I decided that it might be worth a purchase. Just as I heard, this cd crushed! My favorite tracks on this disc were Conquerors of Armageddon, Soul Devourer, and Ravager. My one complaint is that some of the songs seem too long and sound repetitive. After not listening to many brutal bands in the last 2 years, maybe there is some life left in the brutal death metal genre."
4,Doeas The Wheel of Fortune mirror a historical family?,"Susan Howatch has used real historical families as the basis for Penmarric (Henry II), Cashelmara (Edward I) and The Rich Are Different and The Sins of the Fathers (Caesar and Cleopatra). Does The Wheel of Fortune reflect a historical family? If so, which one? You can e-mail me at gdavid@mcclainfinlon.com"
2,"so, so",Not all that. It doesn't really give you a whole lot of info about the states or features of the area.
4,"Fun, if inconsequential, dance beat.","Kromozone Project had a brief run of mainstream radio popularity in the summer of 1999 with its dance hall hit ""Take My Love"". There's not much to the song lyrically. The complexity of the lyrics (or lack thereof) is right up there with Alice DeeJay's ""Better Off Alone"". It just happens to be an amazingly catchy tune (unlike Alice DeeJay's tune). There is a fun interplay between a seductive female voice and a soaring male voice. All in all, it's an entertaining piece of music. This CD single contains 10 different iterations of this song. The original radio edit is still the best of the bunch, though the Mainstream Dance Mix and Electrofunk Countdown Mix are also worth a listen. The rest of the versions are decent, but ultimately are filler. However, this does not detract from the overall experience of owning this CD."
5,I have heard this song on the radio and I love it!,This song has the potential to be a maximum club hit! I like it very much. It has a great beat that you can get your groove on to!
2,Oil Diffuser,The scent was too mild and certainly did not provide the aroma that I expected through the reeds. I was disappointed and will not buy this product again.
2,"Some good, some bad","The review of good and bad designs is useful. But Tufte's ""theory"" of good design seems to boil down to one thing only: use less ink. Using this single-minded technique, he ""improves"" several designs, which look worse to me, not better. Similarly with his new design ideas, most of which didn't look like improvements over existing ideas."
5,Pure Joy,"Rarely can you claim a book to be so wonderful, so beautiful and so perfect. Even more rarely can such a description be placed on a book of a technical subject such as we see here. The Visual Display Of Quantitative Information is fewer than 200 pages and yet you'll get so much out of it. Tufte writes with an amazing precision; no word is superfluous. You can sense Tufte's commitment to his work; his passion and quality. The book is crafted with the design principles he set forth. It's a stunning masterpiece and you'll savor every word."
4,Tufte's excellent third book starts showing his limitations,"Tufte's first two books concentrated on the print medium, where he is comfortable and knowledgable. This book steps into the computer graphics domain, where his knowledge is only partially applicable.He fully recognizes the problems related to the limited pixel resolution of the computer screen, but he doesn't know what to do about it. In his example screens for the Museum kiosk, his vision is clear but impractical. He knows what should be done if more screen resolution were available, but fails to show how his vision can be embodied in the computer screens we really have available.I hope Tufte will rethink the subject and figure out how to properly apply the high temporal resolution of the screen to make up for its low spatial resolution."
4,Great for data analysts as well as intra-internet developers,"I read this book when it was first released. It is exactly what it claims to be, a good ""how to"" book for beginning visual data representation. As a very experienced (Ogilvy-Mather) graphic designer (MFA) turned software/systems developer (MS Math, MS CompSci), I have seen too many websites whose ""developers"" obviously knew nothing about this subject! I think before another website is built by one of these neophytes, this book should be ""required reading"" as part of a study course on how to get the intended message to the intended audience in the most effective manner possible."
4,Pretty Good,"I'm in love with nneka! Her vocals are a little below average but, I love the message, and music. I recently purchased No Longer At Ease via mp3, and although it came faster.. it didnt have the album art that Victim of Truths' cd had. Also Nneka herself did the art work."
2,This is not real Jewish hiphop,"If you are looking for Weird Al Yankovic type music, ok, this album might be for you. But for those who like Jewish rappers with a sense of pride and that are more ""real"", I highly suggest checking out Blood of Abraham ""Future Profits"", Hip Hop Hoodios ""Raza Hoodia"" and Remedy Ross ""Code Red"". Those acts have far better beats and can make you think or laugh without being self-deprecating or cliche. Skip M.O.T. and check out some real Jew-beats, aiight?"
1,Total novelty...and not good novelty even,"Nice try, but too much of ""trying too hard-ness"" Too bad. The beats are not legit...If you really want some good Jewish hip hop, check out Chutzpah or Matisyahu."
1,This is a terrible book,"Poorly written and horribly, horribly edited. That aside, it is an easy read. But her message is so convoluted. There is no logical progression of thought or information and she often contradicts herself from one chapter to the next. 75% of the book is filled with diet mentality ""tricks"" and ""Don't"" and ""No's"" and ""Control"" and ""Discipline"", then the rest of the book claims there are no ""bad"" foods, diets are bad and we all just need to get in touch with our natural hunger, and feed it.I would highly recommend ""Outsmarting the female fat cell"" by Debra Waterhouse. Not only is the message clear, logical and healthy but she explains the physiology behind it. She lays out a reasonable program. And, it's about $15 cheaper."
5,Nutrition and Health,We do work with Kids and nutrition. Found this book to be helpful and wanted to learn about Dorothy Ziegler and her take on nutrition. Great price through Amazon.
2,"Pretty pictures, silly suggestions","Some of the recepies were enjoyable, but on the whole not particularly exciting. The book provided very little insight into the entertaining process, and even less guidence regarding the appropriate method of execution for each of the menus.The suggested decorations, while somewhat interesting, were completely useless provided one doesn't own at least 5 sets of brightly colored tableware, or a spare 40 hours to assemble some of the decarations detailed in the book."
5,Entertainer in Nashville,This book is beautifully put together and offers a lot of great pictures and interesting ideas. Originally got from the library and had to buy a copy for myself. Great planning ideas too.
4,Delicious candy,My children love this candy. The first time they had it was at Epcot in Orlando. Now I buy them whenever I see them on sale.
3,Imported Chocolate,"I love Cadbury flakes, these were a little dry, but I think anytime you buy imported candy you are going to find the same problem. Good value."
3,Too sweet,"Assuming you get these from a good seller(which most people on here didn't seem to get, so be careful about where you get them!), these are far too sweet! They are a decent chocolate, similar to Cadbury milk chocolate bars you can get in the US, but they have an interesting flaky texture. I think they are a bit sweeter than regular Cadbury milk chocolate bars(but those are already pretty sweet too, so am not sure), and even though I like the texture, it's not worth it to pay so much for them. I suggest if you're craving Cadbury chocolate just stick with the kinds you can get in the US, it saves you money and hassle."
1,Awful Taste,I had never tried these before but how can you go wrong with chocolate and coconut. These fall apart all over the place and the taste was just awful. I had about two bites and threw all the rest in the trash. I'm sure glad I didn't pay much for them.
2,Difficult review,"This is a difficult review for me because I love the Cadbury Flake bars. However, the bars I received from Trade Concepts are stale and brittle. I thought I'd cut cost instead of having a friend send them to me. You get what you pay for. Instead of my tasty flakey chocolately bar, I got a flat, pale looking crumbling mess (except for the places where it had melted and fused together). In all Flake is an excellent product. I'd give it 4.5 stars. But you have to be careful of the seller. It might be better to buy them from an import gourmet food store or have someone in the UK (if you know someone) mail them to you. I've learned my lesson."
1,cadbury flake,"i was so excited to order this candy as i havent had any for 23 yrs...when i was last in germany....and to my horror..this candy tasted like it had been saved for that period of time.....it was so stale....i was very disappointed. i love cadbury candy....but for the cost, this was not worth it.....guess i'll have to wait till i go overseas again."
1,disappointed,"I am british and every year I try to get special items for Christmas. I just ate one of these flakes and it was stale and dry. I could not tell what the use by date was as it was in arabic. This is the first time I have used this company, will not use them again."
1,Old,Received the candy 3 days after it's expiration date. Disappointed as I expected to received candy that would last a long time.
1,Cadbury or Seller Fail...,"The candy was so stale and it has some arabic writing on it? When I ordered, it said shipped from U.K. so I don't know why they have foreign language printed on it. Total disappointment. Disgusting!"
5,Chocolatey Heaven,"If you love Cadbury's chocolate, you'll love these flaky morsels. Creamy chocolate that melts nicely in your mouth and I confess to loving them with a hot cup of tea. Delish!"
5,Green Day is back!,I LOVE THIS CD! I don't know why everyone tends to focus on it being a Rock Opera but I just think of it as another Green Day CD. And I think it is their best yet! They have grown up a lot since Dookie and I really didn't care for the last few CDs. I love this CD however not one song on this CD is terrible! I don't skip any songs and each song is lyrically brilliant! I hope people don't base this CD on past Green Day experiences...I know that Green Day has had its ups and downs but this one is truly an up! If you review this CD from the point of never hearing Green Day before I think you will love it! I know a lot of the singles are played to death on the radio...at least they are where I am from...and that makes you not want to own this CD; just remember there are plenty of songs on the CD and those few singles will grown on you once they get off the radio. The CD is great for not a hard-core punk sound but more of a pop punk sound; even so I love it!
2,NEXT!,"I really don't like this album. Dookis was a pretty pop punk album, too. But American Idiot is a really boring piece of crap.I'm not gonna say I hate this album cus they chage or sold out, but seriously, who on earth will LOVE this garbage?Great job Billy Joe! More money, more teen fans!"
3,GREEN DAY ON EMO DAYS....,"American idiot got 3 or 4 good songs, but most of the album is very pop and emo...they totally lost their fury, and now reminds me the pathetic emo movement...."
2,Bought CD for a song,I bought this CD because I loved one of the songs on it. I assumed I'd like more by the same artist. But I was wrong. So I never listen to it because it is too much trouble when I only like the one song.
3,Decent,"Simply the best NEW track is ""too much too soon"", but all of the other favorites from American Idiot! Governator I feel is the worst song and shoplifter sounds very Warning like."
3,"ok, just ok","Dookie and Insomnia blow this away. It is not as good as their older stuff and the band has developed a whole new sound unlike anything ever heard by me. It's ok and most people will like it. But, those of you who are used to songs like Basketcase and When I Come Around, well, Green Day just doesn't make songs like that anymore. WMUWSE is a very good song in its own right though. However, some of the longer movements were not all that great and I could do without (St. Jimmy story, etc.)."
5,This album is a mirror,"For those looking to consider themselves and their world, this album is a musical take on that process, and its authors along with us on that journey, sharing their own take/perspective.For those just wanting to hear something loud, or something that reflects/enhances their mindlessness, this album is a ""sellout,"" pretentious offering; how dare a band ask us to go along with them on a journey of consideration of our state and age?That kind of talk/effort should only come from...from, WHO exactly?Get me?When you see this album, you see the best and worst of your own self; in that way, it's subversive and transformative, which is what the best art always is.5 stars."
1,0 Stars actually,"okay, so when my mom starts singing along to every song on this album u knoe that greenday has sold out. they arent the same as they were in the 90's. They plain suck now. they used to appeal to hard rockers and punks, now they appeal to little 5 year old girls and 40 year old women. they used to be one of my favorite bands. everything before there greatist hits album is good. dont bother with shenanigans and american idiot they both blow!"
1,Rock And Roll?,"You call this Rock And Roll? I don't, the newbie bands, like Green Day, Blink 182, and similar stuff, like Mariah Carrey, have shrouded actual good bands away from pop culture and have been preventing authentic Rock And Roll bands their rise into fame!I tell you what, I can't wait till this Green Day fad is over, and hopefully when it does, we might finally get some good bands out there that are ambitious as classic bands like Van Halen, Motley Crue, Ac/dc, GNR, Dio, and so on, in their likeness.(...)! And still, you call this Rock And Roll! Don't waste your money on this CD, you could get your money's worth more on four pairs of boxer briefs instead!"
2,this is crap.,greenday used to be good. all their other albums have been great but this one...oh this is just crap. they went mainstream. half of these teeny bopper kids didn't even know who greenday was a year ago! its completely insane. boulevard of broken dreams is probably the worst song by greenday i have ever heard. its not like them at all. i'm disapointed.
4,Good music with a lot of whining,"There's a lot of hype about the lyrics being profound in this 70-some minute punk opera album. One guy even told of a big payoff on the last song. Here's what I heard in themes from beginning to end.Whine about being a middle class american.Whine about the news media.Whine about his parents.Whine about being a pothead.Whine about his suicidal friend.Whine about his dead friend.and finally....Whine about breaking up with his girlfriend.No big payoff, nothing profound, just a bunch of typical punker whining.I expected more from an OPERA.Music is still solid power pop punk that is very simple yet sounds good. The only difference in this album & Green Day's previous efforts: More Whining, and all the songs are linked together without stops."
1,My faith has died...,"Yes there was a big fuss when they signed with ""Warner Brothers,"" the terms sell-out and posuers often came with the name Green Day, but I disagree, selling out is when you change music styles to make money, they didn't sellout then, they sold out now. This album is horrible, the only good song is ""American Idiot,"" the rest just doesn't sound like them, it sounds forced and just bad in general. I miss Green Day, the old Green Day, if they came back to their roots they'd make money, sure not as much, but they'd also gain alot of respect from disillusioned fans like myself and many many others."
1,Extra Credit for English,"Once upon a time, Green Day was the voice of a generation. They wrote about touchy political issues without restraint. Their music was pure punk rock. Then, with the release of ""American Idiot"", Green Day had officially sold out. Record sales and fame became more important than music and self-expression. All of the sudden, the group's biggest fans became preppy high school girls, and their music basically became a part of the money hungry pop genre."
1,Awful Political CD,"This CD is all about politics. Sorry, I don't want government lessons in my rock music. If I wanted a Fu*k Bush book then I would've bought one. Stay away, buy Dookie if you don't have it already. If you do, avoid this overly political garbage like the plague."
2,Jesus of Suburbia is the only redeeming track,"I'm going to shoot myself if I hear ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" again. In the face."
1,A QUOTE TO SUM UP THIS GROUP...,"""billie joe armstrong is a short arsed f**king c*nt"" - wattie, the exploitednow that's punk! you wankers!"
1,"Who likes these idiots, not us toads!","Toro: Say Pancho(laughing), Green Day named an album after themselves, the stupido Maricone Idiots! Pancho: Si Toro, anyone who gives these fake punks a 5 star are ridiculous. Toro: Pancho, the lead singer's name is Billie Joe, I think he is either a hermaphrodite or a redneck(laughs). Pancho: Toro, he is loco in the cabasah. Toro: Songs like the title track, Boulevard of Broken Dreams and Wake Me Up When September Ends prove these guys only care about money and not their fans. Pancho: These loco gringos had to jump on Bush-bashing kick to resuscitate their sagging career. Toro: Anyone who is loving these gringos are stupido, BAMINOS from this PRONTO!"
2,From Conservative Parent,"I think these guys are a little too wild. I cannot believe that 5th graders are idolizing these pleasure happy baffoons. The wise ones will soon realize the superficiality inherent in their lyrics and their crooked lifestyles. Catchy and energetic, but very dangerous.Sex drugs and rock in roll, yahoo....yahoo....yahoo.....Yes, there is sin in the world. :("
1,this is crap,"im 13, so i would think i should like green day right? wrong. this is by far one of THE WORST green day CD's. all them littel posers are runnin around singing american idiot, they dont even know all the other green day songs..the good ones before american idiot, the only good song on this cd is ""Wake Me Up When September Ends""."
1,Utter rubbish.,"This album is by far thw worst thing they have ever done, everything they did was acceptable and pretty much fantastic until this pile of rubbish came along.Thye are completely washed up, just goes to show people will buy anything thats in the charts."
1,Junk,Yet another terrible record by Greenday.Why submit your ears to the torture that is a greenday song?Do not buy.
1,this band is terrible,"this band is terrible and has never done anything remotely good. now they are hailed as saviors of rock (see recent Entertainment Weekly cover). How an entire album of generic power-chords and limp lyrics can be considered good is beyond me. Someone gave this to me, who mistakenly bought it thinking it may be good, and called it ""crap"". I listened to it, laughed, then put the CD in my local Hollywood Video night deposit box. I hope someone else can enjoy this utter waste of plastic."
1,Green Day Idiots,"This is junk, derivative, vacant and one dimensional. It is like something completely created by P.R. people using a lot of hype, black mascara and some rebellious, sensational lyrics that sound as inane as Babs Streisand and her lame and unoriginal ""Stranger in a Strange Land,"" although different musical genre. This Greenday fare is not music. Yes, let's be different and hate Americans...how cool...how trendy...how blah, stupic and boring. Buy this robot music if you want to waste your money."
