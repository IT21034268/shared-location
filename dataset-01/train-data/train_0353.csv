4,Well written but frustrating,"This book was pretty well written, but it was a bit frustrating to read. In the story, Vicky went on a road/camping trip with her family. She meets a mysterious boy named Zachary. Zachary is... well, a bit of a hoodlum who doesn't like the world, ect. He is interested in Vicky, and she returns his affections. However, her family isn't so sure they are the perfect match... This was a bit of a frustrating book to read because Vicky is so naive, but I enjoyed it all the same."
5,Very comprehensive and compassionate,I appreciated his thoroughness. Lots of web sites to contact for all types of depression. Also a strong focus on spirituality. It gives everyday help.
3,entertaining,I have read a lot of Peter Lovesey and read any of his books I can get. This series is kind of light and fluffy-entertaining but not one to keep you on the edge of your seat or make you want to know more about the characters.
4,I like it a lot,"It's a fashion-looking bag. The actual bag is not as big as I imagine but good enough for most of my belonging. You'll have difficulty to put book or paper in it. The bag is pretty light so your sholder won't be sored.Basicly, I like this bag a lot."
4,"Simple, Fasctinating, and Weirdly Romantic","I would consider myself a semi-fan of Mike Patton's past work. I've loved albums such as Mister Bungle's California, but found much of his music to be self indulgent and clever, rather than inspired. Romances blows my mind, however. Overall, this work would probably best be described as a collection of soundscapes rather than songs; and within this context it suceeds brilliantly. Throughout this album layer after layer of shimmering instrumental and evocative vocal tracks create of mood that can only be described as dreamy, sensual and yes -- romantic! In fact, what Patton & Kaada may have produced here is the most bizzare makout album of all time! If you're looking to rock out stay away from Romances. But if you're in search of something different and could use a soundtrack for getting hot and bothered with the coolest and weirdest significant other possible, I highly recommend this album."
2,Not in love,"Another half-cooked, lighthearted experiment from the former FNM vocalist just feels typically overindulgent without having much substance to back up an enforced style of whimsical morbidity."
5,Mike Will Attack Strong! Gambate sensei!,"Ok. Mike Patton, Nuff said. Kaada's No You don't is very awesome. No what happens when you combine these two artist? You get an ultimate turn-on with your girlfriend. It seems very much like they combine many of there ideas equally. Kaada's soothing melody and mike rawness. hell Yeah. Overall it's lovely and never forgotten. Patton & Kaada, hell yeah. Go see it live to beileve it!Hayaku!"
1,plodding and uninteresting,"FNM were great. Mike Patton's sound experiments on Tzadik were great. Mondo Cane is a hoot. Crank is exciting. Tomahawk is powerful. This CD is a total disappointment. For what its worth, I found it devoid of ideas or inspiration--just sort of plods along; sounds like two guys with a mic and electronic equipment killing time while waiting in a doctor's office."
2,boring,NOTHING NEW HERE.I like reading the ridiculous reviews of these cds where people gush all over the screens over how much they love Patton. This cd is dull. Suffering from Patton overexposure. Maybe he should actually spend some time and make an awesome album (Like Secret Chiefs 3 - Book of Horizons) rather than dozens of merely adequate ones.
3,book quality,"The book arrived about as timely as I would predict as far as snail mail goes. The quality of the book was poor. When I first opened it, I guess the binding glue was old and crusty because about pages 62-73 fell out."
1,captures little of the sense of Shuar culture,"The title is good -- the Shuar (Jivaro) indeed have a special reverence for sacred waterfalls -- but the rest of the book captures little of the true flavor of Shuar culture and character. (I spent several months among the Shuar many years ago.) As an example, Nunkui is the spirit of Earth when referred to as a living being, but the author refers to Nunkui as ""a female crop fairy."" Even if one does not speak Shuar, the relationship of the word ""Nunkui"" to the word ""Nunka"" (land or territory) should be obvious. There is much superficial observation in this book but very little true insight."
1,not good enough,"They try to copy to Green Day and My Chemical Romance, but even when i'm from Mexico i can not lie... they are just not good enough."
5,Flamenco Show,"Sabores, featuring flamenco dancer Sara Baras and her group, is one of the best flamenco DVD's in our collection. Lots of good guitar playing, spectacular cajon and palmas, some gypsy violin and an excellent dance troupe. It's a highly choreographed show, but the performers are so talented it still gets the excitement of a live performance. Be sure and watch the very extended curtain call at the end for absolutely the cutest young flamenco dancer yet."
5,good for beginers how to and inspiration for experianced,I first read this book as a beginner and now five years later I still refer to it and get ideas for more intricate projects. Very well edited so any one can read it. Because it has so many differant writers you get a lot of differant ideas
4,In need of Barthelme,"The remaining chunks of the master's prose reconnoiterings are brought to light here. Essays, reviews, pieces written on assignment ... what amazes is how closely Barthelme's nonfiction resembles his classic short stories. If you already own ""40 Stories"" and ""60 Stories"" and still find yourself GASPING for more Barthelme air ... this is for you."
1,Jay Jays the Jet Plane,"Paid way too much for this little toy. I would not recommend it. Customer service was of no help and gave me ""smart"" remarks instead of help."
5,The ultimate surfer movie,"Wow, this is one of those movies that those of us who watched it in 1966 when it was released are now proud to show to our own children - giving them an example of what a REAL surfing movie should be.Shot as a documentary by Bruce Brown, it follows two surfers as they trek around the world, looking for the perfect wave. Do they find it? Contrary to our love of the ambiguous ending, yes, they do find it, down in South Africa on a beach where the wave starts at the tip and seems to go on and on and on, following the coast long enough that you think, by the time the surfers beach themselves, they'll probably need a taxi or a train to take them back to their point of origin.There's not a huge story line, but that's an advantage. It allows Brown to focus on subtler themes: the sun, the ocean, friendship, travel, and a period of innocence which is gone forever.This is definitely one to buy and to watch over and over and over."
5,"1966,Uof Hawaii,Free showing,Bruce B.in person,one of many","Back in '66 , I was just a college student in Hawaii. LOVIN' it, surfing when ever we got the chance. Bruce would preview his short movies on surfing at the student union bldg. on campus. His films sparked the thrill of the surf scene. This movie shows us that age of inocence lost, when kids rode the waves and didn't make waves, was cool. Pre-Psychodelic for the kids on the west coast and especially in Hawaii, Bruce's love for the sport clearly comes through in this film. Buy it, watch it, and let it carry you back to a different time...."
5,Amen,"Endless Summer, like it's title, means something very personal to each person who loves this film. Like its magical studio cousin, Gidget, it is deceptively simple, almost amateurish by today's standards. Two boyish surfers follow the sun and summer around the world, surfing exotic shores, mixing with locals. Bruce Brown overdubs with a sweet voice and just-this-side-of-corny narration set to his competent 16mm photography. But, like many masterpieces, it is larger than the sum of its parts---much larger. From the now famous poster image of silhouetted surfers against the backdrop of the beach's infinite horizon to the plain and lilting surf guitar of the theme music, Endless Summer has become not only an evocation of surfing's enchanting allure, but a cultural touchstone of the 60's as well and, for a couple of generations since, the sweet memory of youth itself---endless, adventurous and warm."
1,DAMAGED used DVD!!!,Purchased our first used DVD from Amazon and it was scratched so badly it could not even be watched! VERY disappointed since it was a gift for my son's birthday! Serves me right for trying used! :(
2,"Quite dated, bad humor","This 1966 relic has achieved a certain cult status by virtue of its brilliant poster, which has been circulated worldwide and on T-shirts. The actual movie, however, is quite lame. The narration has dated badly. The first half, when the two teen surfers are in Africa, is non-PC in the extreme. Nowhere do they speak. The film is entirely narrated by Bruce Brown, who is seen in a few short clips of surfers. The soundtrack of surf music is one of the highpoints. The film ignores surfing in S. America, the Carribean, the Mediterranean and much of the southern Pacific. We never find out who financed their global excursion, nor anything else about them at all. Therefore, we don't really care about their search for the 'perfect' wave. A rather trivial film, but still charming as a period piece."
1,It has been 6 weeks and it still has not arrived.,"The movie is awesome. I remember watching it on the VHS with my surfer-bum parents 20 years ago. If it ever arrives, I would love to see it again."
4,Classic rhymes with Fantastic,The title of this review sums it all up really.You can not have a collection of surf movies with this one left out.
2,Unable to access digital copy,"Product was advertised to come with a digital copy, but what was not made clear was that you need a computer with a Blue-ray drive to be able to access it. The digital copy cannot be accessed with a normal blue ray player. Unless you happen to be the rare person that has a Blue ray drive in your computer don't pay the additional money."
5,Endless Classic,Endless Summer is the classic surf video. Good clean fun and two surfers living the ultimate travel and surf dream. Welcome relief from the same ol' crazy CG movies of today.
5,TELL ME HOW TO FIND THE ORIGINAL MOVIE POSTER!!!,"Somebody PLEASE help me locate the original poster for ""The Endless Summer"" movie. Any suggestions?"
1,boring documentary on surfing in the 60's,what a waste of 3 dollars do not buy it unless you want to throw 3 bucks out the window
5,"on repeat for my chihuahua ""Cookie"" :)","I bought a blu ray player, and installed it in my PC, and this blu ray will keep my chihuahua Cookie company while im at work.I will have this on repeat, and she will hopefully absorb the surfing ways from this old school video.Cookie is my surfing bird! hehehehGreat vidGreat serviceGreat times"
5,Hilarious,"I randomly bought this movie, although i personally don't surf, i love surf movies, so decided to go for this one. This movie was so funny to me, it keeps you laughing, excited, and even inspires you to want to travel the world! :) Great classic, fun packed, great for the entire family.-includes amazing surf shots, wild life.. :)"
5,The endless wave,"The Endless Summer Collection is great. Being a surfer for 20 yrs. There are few movies/documentries out there that capture the pure eurphoric state of mind surfing gives and Bruce Brown hit the bulls eye with Endless Summer and Endless Summer 2. Iv had the pleasure meeting Robert August and ""Wingnut"" who both are featured in the collection. Now if only i could get the Astrodeck guys to put the Wave Worrior series on DVD i would have my ultimate collection."
1,No digital copy,"Great movie which is why I bought it, but there was no digital copy. Nope, neither a disc or a code to redeem online. All it had was the blueray itself. It even says on the packaging that it has a digital copy, but nada."
3,Could be great.,"I have used multiple versions of Paper port starting with version on floppy. It is absurd that now nuance is controloing owner, you have to pay for support. Program constantly locks up when going to folders that have a lot of files in them. Have to start up and immediatly re-sort files. That will lock up the program. Then force shut down and restart computer and program. Now it will open that folder. If browsing folders, expect lock up. I suspect if you are new to paper port and do not have a lot stored in it, you will not have these issues. I have lots of folder and lots of files from many years. Previous versions did not give me these issues, so I bought ver 8 then version 9. Do not recommend 9 except that pdf create and edit is nice. Lots of patients needed. Wish I could get some support."
2,Terrible disappointment,"I was very excited to get this product. It scans well, files well, is very sexy and promising. Then I decided to Search for a few files based on my Keywords. Oooops! It won't search!!If you don't know already, PaperPort offers you only one free tech support call. After that it's $20 a pop. The rather surly technician I reached had me re-install my program. Okay, but it still wouldn't search. Then he told me to un-install Windows Service Pack 2. Uh uh, no way. Nada. That's when I asked for a refund.I bought MyCab for $40. Tech support is marvelous, within one hour over the Internet. The only thing it doesn't do is scan within the program, but then I can do that, can't I?AKNapa, CA"
3,Exceeded expectations,The program does all that was claimed for it and was delivered in excellent time.Scansoft's poor support is the only reason that I did not award 5 stars. (You should not have to pay for support for a just-purchased product)
1,Visioneer is trash,"Great scanner, terrible software. Unfortunately, after the acnner works great for 6 months, the software stumbles and then errors and closes every time it is accessed. Visioneer is well aware of this and provides zero support for ""older models"" and requires customers to purchase new software. From what I have read on the web sites about Visioneer, the upgrades and new software fairs no better. Beware."
1,FULL OF BUGS,"I was using Paperport 8.0 on Windows XP with a Visoneer scanner.I installed 9.0, and it is full of bugs:(1) Scan Settings does not work, and requires a patch from thetheir website.(2) The restore Defaults button does not work(3) The scanner freezes mid-scanetc..."
4,I think this software is great!,"I scanned a decade worth of personal papers like tax returns and such into Paperport 9 Deluxe. I move around a lot and I am glad to turn all those papers into electrons. I have a HP All in One printer, the HP 5510. I have never had any problems with the software. It parks all your documents into thumbnails which are easy to view without opening them. The software is just basically like having a big file cabinet. The only two critisms I can make is one: saved web pages into PDF do not come out very good. The text in a saved web page looks sloppy. And for me the web capture capability does not scroll the page down to capture the whole page like it is supposed to. It always only captures the visible portion of what is on the monitor. Paperport is making me buy PDF Create when I shouldn't have to. (It better work better!) Secondly, I wish Paperport had some backup capability built in."
4,Agatha Christy Christmas stories,"This is not a bit of Hercule Poirot about a murder or something. This is a little book of Christmas poetry and short stories, from Agatha Christie Mallowan. In the first story, Mary looks upon her babe and an angel says she is allowed to see into the childs future, and seeing that future, is told that God has said she has the right to say if the child will live or die....it is up to her, the conversation gets very interesting.Martyers are in another story, having suffered horribly they wonder, was it enough? Did they suffer enough for the Christ? The story of the Naughty Donkey, these will all tug at your heart."
5,This is the one,"If you are the adventure type holiday fotographer, this is the lens you need. Much better then it's predecessors in optical quality and weight. I got triggered to buy one, because it won the joint European Foto Magazines prize of 'lens of the year'.When you like to travel light, this is the only lens you need.Watch out, that you get the right lens, because there are 5 different Tamron 28-200 predecessing models around."
2,Broke at first use!,"The first time I tried to use this, the filter was on really tight. This wrench crushed the filter while it was on the car instead of twisting it off. Then the band on the wrench bent, and one of the swivel-posts came out (which is a rivet, not a bolt, so I can't do anything about it). Yes, my filter was on tight, but if you want your wrench to break at the first sign of a hard job, don't get this."
4,What An Unbelievably Funny Movie!,"The premise of the story contained in this DVD really pushes the envelope, in terms of believability. But, that makes watching it both startling and, at times, hilarious. The things that happen at the small ""mom-and-pop"" motel are such unlikely events. However, there are many moments of suspense, as well..."
3,Motel Hello.....,"I rather enjoy this old horror movie. After having seen it a few nights ago on a movie channel, I decided to write a review. Pretty good horror film for the time. Motel Hell centers around a farmer called Farmer Vincent who runs a remote hotel. However, when people check in, they don't check out. Not all die for Farmer Vincent has a very special garden of his own..... people buried alive up to their necks with their vocal cords cut out so they can not scream or talk and their heads are covered with burlap sacks! As a kind of rip off of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Farmer Vincent smokes meat..... human meat! There are some cool scenes in this movie for a low budget horror movie. A good movie for fans of older horror movies."
3,It's Pyscho meets The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,A twisted farmer and his little sister are harvesting people in the ground instead of vegestables. A rather silly but grusome and entertaining horror movie which is actually quite a tasty dish.
2,Where's John Waters when you need him?,"I've seen this film three times now and every time I see it I can't help but fantasize about how wonderful this movie would have been if it'd been written and directed by John Waters and starring the cast of PINK FLAMINGOS. Can you just imagine how great Divine would have been in the Ida Smith role!As it is the whole thing is just kinda so-so. So boring and so slow moving. Farmer Vincent kills travelers and makes them into meat to sell to other travelers. I understand that this is suppose to be a dry, black comedy but it's just too dry for me. It's kinda like a mix between EATING RAOUL, MOTHER'S DAY and SLAUGHTERHOUSE."
5,Great Story,"I love this story. Its my favorite horror picture. I also really enjoy how the producers were willing to set conventions aside and do what was needed to tell the story! There are great moments of comic relief but the story does not slow down at any point. This movie is great for a party, and be sure to have some smoked meat to give to your guests before the show!"
2,Motel Hell,"Leonard is lost in space - this is a B-classic of all time. You have to see this one - it has been a cult classic in our family for many years. Rory looks like he is on chemotherapy, and the sister on fatty meat's therapy - by the way - she is the gym coach in Porky's. It is so tongue in cheek that even the kids can enjoy the ""Meat's meat and we got ta eat"" mentality. It ought to be remasterd in DVD - it was printed on the old laser format. Watch the guts fly in the last scene. The garden is a neurosurgeon's fantacy - only heads to work with.B. Neely, Neurosurgery, Austin, Texas - this a warped flick for warped minds."
1,A Complete Dud,"The sound this makes is not interesting, fun or pleasing at all - don't waste your money"
2,weak album,"like most soundtracks this one is not good as well. (i always regret buying sountracks.) on this album, the beatz are too tacky, and high profile, mainstream rappers put out an weak performance(dmx, luniz, daz, tray d, mo thugs/lazy bone). a disappointment. a few underground acts tried to rip the tracks, but the tunes and beats just couldn't take it there. And vocal/rap arrangements were stupidly produced.(eg: corny choruses, hooks and intros etc.) the saving grace of the album is ""Survive"" by Snoop dogg and Da Products. probably the only solid cut on this soundtrack. and the highlights of this album was The Lox and Eve with the song""Shotgun Style"", and the other ""aiight/ok""joints are ""Better way"" and ""Playa Style"". out of 19 tracks, not even half the album is listenable. Overrall, to sum it up, a dissapointment and a very lacking album."
1,Save Your $$$ 4 Something Better.,"Save your $$$ 4 a better CD. This CD is pathetic, there are big names on this CD (for example: Snoop Dogg, DMX, Mo Thugs, Eve, Layzie Bone, Daz Dillinger, etc.), but the songs on the CD are trash. This CD sounds like the left-over tracks that are always laying around that were not put on their own albums cuz they sound like s***. Save your $$$ 4 something better."
3,Too large.,Had I known the atlas was this large I would not have purchased it. It has already been added to my next Goodwill pickup.
2,It is more fun to be lost,"The Atlas for South Carolina is not as easy to use as the ones I have used for other states. The roads are not well labeled and the contrast is poor. Roads in urban area are impossible to follow. I found many roads were not paved, but the Atlas did not indicate it. It did have better and more accurate detail than a Garmin."
1,Could have been better,"Having known Teshome wolde for quite sometime, I must say that I was deceived by the content of this Album. It has nothing creative in it. He has either replayed some of his old songs or those of other people. I would have expected something more original from an Artist like him, who has been on the Ethiopian Music scene for such a long time."
5,"Sit down, shut up, and hang on","This is a wonderful album. Molloy is a virtuoso flautist with a low-key manner, while his former Bothy Band colleague Peoples is a charismatic, creative, rather erratic fiddler. But both share the same approach to tunes: d*mn the torpedoes, full speed ahead. Together they play with fire and passion, enlivening the traditional tunes without losing any of their nuances. Brady is a perfect accompanist, supportive but not intrusive, and performs handsomely as a soloist too. This may be an oldie, but it's a recording I keep reaching for again and again."
5,Outstanding,"This is obviously a pickup date and there are some sloppy beginnings and endings, especially on Bag's Groove where the piano intro and sax entrance are in different keys. However these are minor blemishes on a very buoyant session. Byas is very inventive on these standard tunes and Sir Charles is also in fine form. Very well recorded."
5,My favorite Caz album!,This is my favorite album by the Brothers. It is a fun and upbeat mix of great tracks and it regularly goes to Hawaii with us and it is always on my iPod. Heartwarming and fun! I would buy it again...
4,cult member rocks,"This cd was influenced by gun and roses ,velvet revolver,and the stones.I do not know where one reveiwer was listening to ,but this rocks from start to finshed.It has good lyirics mixed in whit great guitar works.Yea you heard the sound before but trust me ,it worth the purchase."
3,"Good shoe, straps are a little off","Pleaser makes really good quality shoes, and the Sky-330 is no exception. It's very solidly built, fits great, the only problem I have is that the front toe straps look a bit more awkward in person than the photo portrays them. They don't look bad exactly, just not quite as tight as they should be. Other than that a good shoe and I'm happy to have them."
1,Super Uncomfortable,"After a min of putting them on, I felt the blood flow being cut off from my toes. I ordered a size 5 (true to size), but the toe opening is so small...I own a pair of Penthouse shoes, and their toe opening is a little larger than these.Returning them."
3,Find a better Fischer-Dieskau recording of this work.,"There must be dozens of CD's with Mahler's 'Das Lied von der Erde' and more than a few with performances by the great baritone, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, so you really don't need this one, which is a transfer from vinyl. I have the vinyl recording, and I wasn't thrilled with it, so I'm doubly unimpressed by this version. The problem is certainly not in Fischer-Dieskau's performance, or in the performance of any others. The problem is with the recording quality, which sounds muddy. The most one can say for this version is that it is inexpensive, but I suspect there are saveral other better recordings, even by Herr F-D which are much more rewarding to the ear."
5,Amazing Song Writer,I have this album on vinyl and unfortunately the recording process was not state of the art. So when it was released in compact disc format the sound quality is not much different from that of the vinyl album. However it still remains one of the best Violetta Parra records out there based on song composition alone. If you're a true fan you can see beyond the sound mixing and appreciate her for the incredible artist she was.
5,lo mejor,"I bought this record as an LP in Mexico City a couple of years after Violeta Parra died ... her life was full of love, intense, high, and clear, and her voice is a direct reflection of that."
2,Historical Jem,Since traveling in Chile I became a fan of this delightful country I am very interested in their music. This recording restores some historical Chilean folk music that is wonderful. However I am very disappointed in the sound quality. It appears the recording was taken from a worn LP since I can hear pre-echo and warble on some of the songs. Also there are no historical liner notes which would have compensated greatly for the poor sound.
3,Try another record label,"I bought this record a while ago. The music is great and was certainly worth it. Other reviewers have more to say about it. But the edition was really poor; cheap to put it bluntly. I see now that there is another edition available, one from the ""wea"" label. I am pretty sure it would be a better choice to try that one. Violeta (and this record in particular) highly recommended:5 stars, ans records no: 1 star."
5,Violeta at her Best,"Violeta shines so brightly in this collect that I consider it her best work. If you can only have one CD by Violetta, get this one!The passion, the politics, and the raw folklore of the artist comes through with each unique work of art included here."
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"It looks good and seems to be constructed well. The only negative is that since the bars that go over the door are a little over-sized to accommodate most doors, it does shift and tap against the door when the door is opened or closed. It would help if it had some type of soft, padded ""feet"" on the back side that would prevent it from hitting and eventually marking the door."
3,Nice Rack - iffy on the over the door fit,This rack is nice in a lot of ways; the towel bars are staggered allowing clearance for towel placement and accessibility yet the racks do not protrude too much to get in your way when passing by the rack. The one issue I had was dealing with the hangar that goes on the door. It is not adjustable and was larger than the thickness of the door. When you hang the rack over the door in this situation the rack has a tendency to move on you as you open and shut the door. The solution I finally settled on that reasonably resolves this issue is I got some foam packaging blocks and cut them to slightly thicker than the gap between the door and the hangar and inserted them on the rack side. The give in the foam was just enough to lock the rack to the door and eliminate the movement
4,Good towel rack especially for the price,"Bought this to actually hang in my room because I didn't want to drill into the wall. Home Depot/Bed Bath & Beyond both had a single 18"" rod at about $20. This was 10 dollars more and can hold a big towel and a smaller one (comfortably while they dry). For the price it wan't bad at all"
3,not new.,"the product I received was definitely not new. must be returned by someone. and a lot of scratches on the nods.I am thinking if I should return it or not.the product itself is kind of what I want though, but I am not happy with the quality."
1,Great if you put towel racks on your exterior doors!,"I can't figure out for the life of me why they would make this item with such large top part that fits exterior doors. I couldn't use this in my bathroom because I have standard doors (1 3/8""), which means that these were too big in width at the top and kept wobbling and being very noisy, not to mention scraping the door at the bottom since the side rods weren't vertical, but at an angle towards the door. I even tried putting something to stabilize these (like bubble wrap at the top between the door and the side rails, but that didn't help at all.If they made a version of this with 1 3/8"" doors, I would buy it in an instant and probably be very happy with it. But as it stands, this is useless because I don't need towels hanging on the inside of my front door."
4,Good For the Money,"The towel rack came slightly warped which was easily twisted into proper shape. The rack was purchased to go over a shower stall glass wall and not over a door. Because the actual over the door piece is sized to fit over a door and not a thin shower stall wall it is much larger than I needed and slid back and forth. To compensate, I cut Styrofoam 1/4 inch thick and sized it to fit in front of the over the door metal where it touched the glass. For the rear of the over the door piece (inside the shower area) I cut more Styrofoam to fit but slightly thicker and squeezed it in. This prevented the unit from moving and held it securely in place without any metal touching the glass wall. And lastly, I put two clear circular 1/2 inch vinyl bumpers (purchased at a hardware store) at the bottom of the rack where it touched the glass."
2,Chrome Towel Rack,"Over whose door? The top of this rack is so wide we had to put in styrofoam pads to make it fit. Good thing the back part is in the closet. The ""over the door"" part measures at least two inches. The standard door depth is 1 1/4 inches."
2,Bought and returned 2,"I had hoped this would work as it looks nice, but that is not the case. The first one I bought: one of the bars was threaded incorrectly, so it wouldn't screw onto the white piece. The second one: once put together, I hung on the door but now the door won't shut due to the top part that goes over the door is not laying flat. Besides that, I also don't like the back of the rack, I have only hung the rack on the door long enough for one shower (with the door open since it won't shut with it on there) and it has scratched up our door.I guess I am still on the hunt for a good over the door towel rack!"
2,Not a great fit,I guess our towels are too big and our door is too small.. It bangs against the door every time you lift your towel. It does not hold 3 of our towels wet to dry because they are all on top of each other and folded. Bummer! Great concept but needs to be wider both ways. (g's wifey)
4,Towel rack,Useful and esthetic. Product arrived promptly. Towel rack is small so we use it as a rack for wash cloth and hand towel. Not suitable for bath towels.
4,Similar product - Dissimilar price,"I purchased what seems to be the same product,at a different price. It's made by homebasix, instead of interdesign. I haven't had it for more than a few hours but so far it seems very nice. It was easy to put together, it fits nicely on my door and I altered the original layout by making the bars removable for ease of access. I didn't like the way it was packaged but it wan't damaged so I guess it doesn't matter. Search for ""door hanger with towel bars, chrome"" $17.43 right here on amazon."
1,Terrible,"Let's see...-made out of cheap plastic material-arrived broken-designed to fit over a door that would be impossibly wideNeedless to say, I was not satisfied, particularly at this price point."
3,Attractive but not a great fit,"Literally, because the over-the-door hooks are made for a wider door and cause the entire unit to move with the door. So make sure you measure your door before you buy.Also, towels do not dry with this rack. The towels in our house need to be folded in half in order to fit and three folded towels hanging next to each other will remain damp.So, if you have a bath situation that wouldn't fall under any of the above areas go ahead and buy. It does look nice."
2,Tiny rack that doesn't fit over door,"I was very suprised when this towel rack arrived. It's small. If a towel is folded, it will fit over one of the bars. However, if you want to throw a wet towel on one of the bars to dry, the bar is not wide enough to accomodate it. There are three bars and they are very close together. This just isn't designed very well. It's quite compact. The over-the-door hooks are too wide to fit a standard door as well. There are holes on the back on the hooks, but even if you chose to screw the rack into your door, there would still be a gap. My door won't close all the way with this rack on it. Maybe others won't have this problem, but it's certainly an issue for me. I'm going to continue the search for an over-the-door towel rack that actually accomodates towels. This one is far too small to be of any use."
1,Failure,"We struggled to assemble this rack, but its dimensions seemed faulty--one of the vertical rods was askew. Before we could even hang the rack, the curved end of one of the bottom rod-holders (where the porcelain knobs go) snapped off."
2,ridiculous fit,"Other than being surprisingly small, it's a nice towel bar... until you try to fit it over a door. The square hooks are gigantic, about two inches deep, which would be great if wanted to hang your towels on the front door. Not a single door in my house is large enough to warrant these gigantic, one-size-fits-all over-the-door hooks."
4,Draft Chair Review,"Solid chair, decent price, the back has no tilt or it would be a 5 star.Shipped safely and in decent time."
3,"Solid chair, but no arms","Assembly was easy, and it's a solid, sturdy chair, but the product description specifically says it has arms, but they shipped the model without arms. This is probably Amazon's fault since one picture shows it with arms but the checkout picture does not..."
4,Good Buy,Exactly as expected - good value. Had a little trouble putting it together but they were very helpful. Purchased two to replace our fabric ones - these should hold up a lot longer.
2,drafting chair,This chair pitches the user too far forward. When you sit in it you feel like you're going to slide off the front.
4,Sex & Zen & A Bullet in the Head for K-movies,"Remember that book about HK movies from a few years ago called Sex & Zen & A Bullet in the Head? Well this book is just like that only it talks about K-movies. With the articles, tons of reviews, and cool style, KCTNHK is the best book on the topic and looks great on my bookshelf!"
4,A great read,"I wish I had this book a year ago. I would have saved so much money in choosing which Korean DVDs to buy. This book rates and reviews a number of movies and even has some background on what's happening in the Korean movie industry. If you are a fan of Korean movies, check this out."
4,Happy with the product,Works great. Was a little skeptical because of the price. But im happy with the outcome. Received it fast.
1,Do not buy,Bought two of these so that I would have a spare before the current one ran out. They both broke within a couple of weeks. Not returnable as past the return date!
1,If i can ratet it lower I Would,This is the 2nd time i have bought cartridges from a Amazon Co.I bought 3 Cartrides From InkersNot happy!!! 500 copies from each total Maybe 600 from #2They were sold at 5000 at 5% coverageI ended up at Office Max on a Saturday AM to buy 3 new onesI got what i paid for TRASHOh yea service was good BUTTTTTTodays Date 5/30/2010They say 3 strikes your OUTThey wont get another chance from me
1,Defective product!!!,"The item is defective. After only 5 pages, it printed all black lines... product is NO GOOD!!!"
3,"8 1/4"" blade","This blade while being advertised as a 8 1/4"" blade is actually 8"" which is just enough to not allow a full 3 inch depth of cut with your plate saw. Other than that it is a quality freud blade"
3,It's Not 8 1/4,"I ordered this blade with an 8 1/4 skil worm drive saw. It's a Diablo from Freud, so of course it's good and yes it will last a really long time. But, it's smaller by an 1/8"" in radius than the blade that came with the saw. Here's the annoying part: as advertised, will cut 3"" at 90 degrees. What they meant to say was 2 7/8"" at 90 degrees. It makes a difference when you're cutting through a pile of 2x4's. I will probably get the Big Foot attachment to compensate for my small saw."
5,A great ending to the trilogy,"Shelley Peterson has once again created a masterpiece. It is the third book in her series about Dancer, and Abby Malone. This book has a good bit of horse to keep the horse enthusiast happy, yet ventures outside horses to the world of acting. Ghosts, and other suprises abound as the local acting troupe puts on Pinnochio. Of course Owen still wants to get his hands on Dancer, and we find out what happens to Mousey (now that she is grown up - from the first book Dancer). I would reccomend these well written horse books to anyone - they are simply amazing."
4,good blade,"Very thin blade kerf, cuts well and cuts clean. Lasts through many cuts and carbide tips hold edge well. Recommended"
4,6-inch radial saw blade,"I recently purchased a used Porter Cable saw and the blade was damaged. I looked for replacement blades at several retail stores in the area and they did not stock 6"" blades for the saw. Amazon had the blades at a reasonable cost. The blade arrived in the mail shortly after the order was placed in perfect condition. The blade is made by a reputable company and fit the saw perfectly. I have use the saw with the new blade with good results."
2,cool cd,"its cool but not consistent, let's make a deal is the only good song on the CD, take my word for it, you're better off not wasting ur money and getting the CD for one good song so just get the single"
5,Amazing Album,"Dangerman is an overlooked group and this album is a awesome showing of their talent, hope they put out another album soon"
5,Lost and Found,I bought this CD back when Let's Make a Deal was on the radio. I absolutely love this group and have bought this CD three times because I have lost it twice (I think my friends took it) and absolutely need these songs which will make anyone smile and shake a few.
1,Scansoft's very low grage product,"Whatever we read All that Manufacturer's describtion On this SOFTWARE as an advertisement, does not work fully. It just like a bait. I was using Paperport 8 Deluxe which was almost thousand percent good enough in compare to PaperPort Pro 9 Office. So after I upgraded Paperport Pro 9 Office from Paperport 8 Deluxe, I feel myself a very stupid."
4,SIMPLY UNFORGETTABLE,"I LOVED THIS STORY. IT WAS TOLD WELL.ROMANTIC, CHARMING, ANDGOOD PLOT.I FOUND BOTH LUCIUS AND FRANCES DELIGHTFUL.I DID NOT WANT IT TO END,I WANTED TO KNOW HOW THEY WOULD WORK EVERYTHING OUT,ABOUT THEIR LIVES TOGETHER.THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME READING A BOOK BY MARY BALOGH. SHE NOW HAS A NEW FAN,I CAN NOT WAIT UNTIL SHE CONTINUES THE STORY WITH ANOTHER BOOK,ABOUT ONE OF THE OTHER TEACHERS.A BOOK ABOUT THE YOUNGER SISTER WOULD ALSO BE NICE.I LIKED ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE BOOK EVEN PETERS THE COACHMAN.I THINK OTHER PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THIS BOOK TOO!"
2,Simply Forgettable,"Save your money and don't buy this book at the hardcover price. It's not worth it. There's nothing wrong with it but it's clear that Balogh is losing her voice and inspiration: the result is a bland book that's totally forgettable. The hero is just another washed down version of Wulfric (complete with internal monologues about unsuitable behaviour and the now famous love/in love thing) and the heroine is very very annoying. Add to that the fact that it reads like an overpadded traditional Regency and the author's lost me by page 150. I forced myself to finish it, hoping it would improve, and, well, it didn't. The hero and heroine are thrust together in the worst contrived manner possible and I'm still wondering what the hero saw in the heroine."
2,"Too long, too repetitive, not Mary's best","I borrowed the book from my sister after she had read it. I asked her how she liked it and she just shrugged, like she didn't know what to say. We are both Balogh fans. I went ahead and read it but I have to admit I skipped a lot. The 'big misunderstanding' turned out to be so stupid, my reaction was ""Is that all??"" The hero kept asking the heroine the same thing and she kept telling him the same answer. It was boring. If you cut about 100 pages out of this book, it might have been good. I got the feeling that to justify the price of a hard cover book, either the publisher, Ms. Balogh or both thought it had to be so many pages long, even if the story didn't need that many. I expected more from Ms. Balogh. I'm also really glad I didn't pay for this book!"
2,Simply Forgettable,"Allow me to preface my review by saying that Mary Balogh is one of my favorite authors. I have been reading her romance novels for ages, and I usually enjoy them very much. Therefore, I was quite disappointed to read this, the first book in her new series. In a word, it was tedious. I can't quite put my finger on exactly what's wrong, but I'll try. For starters, it was about 150 pages too long. I felt that it dragged on...and on...and on. I also felt that the character development was non-existent. Lucius and Frances, the main characters in the book, were so one-dimensional. And boring. (I was surprised, as Mary Balogh usually does a great job in creating characters who have distinct and engaging personalities.) I hope Lucius and Frances don't reappear in future novels. In essence, Simply Unforgettable was a disappointing and tedious read. I guess even our favorite authors can fail us once in a while."
3,Wait for the paperback edition.,"This is a disappointment, a bit of froth; and I wonder what has happened to the Mary Balogh who gave us Longing and Secret Pearl and Silent Melody and others already listed in these reviews. Simply Unforgettable is a quick and probably unrealistic view of the times in which it was written. But I long for the Mary Balogh of depth and darkness and desperation and redemption and abiding love. And I would beg Mary to fight the editors, if that is what it takes, and return to those beautiful, haunting LOVE stories that captured the imaginations of all her many fans who want HER to remain unforgettable."
4,Easy and entertaining reading.,"I am so glad that Mary Balogh is adapting her style of writing to include more humor and witty dialogs. I found her earlier works much too tedious and depressing. But starting with Simply series, her style started to change. Gone are long paragraphs describign longing and feeling desperate. After all, how many times could you feel longing and desperate? And instead, the plot is much faster and dynamic.There is still a nice, romantic ending with things that go exactly right for the hero and heroine. And you will not be disappointed if you wished for a happy ending. But, there are several chapters that should end the book and did not. Again, it is a plot strategy, and after it happens second time, you expect for the story to continue and have another ""final farewell"" again."
4,"Started out great, then fizzled.","It is not a horrible book, but it just isn't original and it's repetitive. This is the first book I have ever read by Mary Balogh, so I didn't know what to expect. In the first few chapters, I was like WOW! What a refreshing change of pace from all other romance books! The author is actually going to allow these characters to have a smoldering, passionate romance with no misunderstandings, etc. Then what happened? Same ole, same ole. As soon as the first passionate encounter ends, this book turns into the same ole storyline as all other romance books. I was interesting enough to keep me turning the pages, so I did give it 4 stars, but I was so disappointed in the fact that I thought I had found a refreshing change when in fact it is just like any number of thousands out there.Here is the storyline as well as 99% of all other romance books -Boy meets girl. Hate. Love. Hate. Love. The end.WHEN?? are we gonna get something different?"
3,Simply Unforgettable,"A man and a woman meet in a snowstorm, have a brief romantic interlude and both have trouble forgetting each other after they go their seperate ways.The struggles to straighten out their feelings and finally get married are a bit too long drawn out - the man is really obsessive about the woman - but it all works out in the end.Linda Sheean"
3,What wonderful characters to waste on a plotless story.,"I have greatly enjoyed most of Mary Balogh's earlier books, and, as usual, her main characters are very engaging. The Viscount Sinclair is charming, romantic, and impulsive. Frances Allard is proud, talented, and beautiful. Great start, right? Everything is lovely for about the first 70 pages.Then, the plot becomes a ping pong back and forth of a marriage proposal and a refusal. Enough already. I hate books that drag on for another 100 or so pages when clearly all that needs to happen has already happened. Sure, Ms. Allard has her secrets to keep, but they just aren't monstrous enough secrets to prolong the cycle of ""Marry me."" - ""I can't."" for the next 2/3 of the book. I advise skipping this book and checking back with the esteemed Mary Balogh on her next try."
2,Deadly Dull,"This book was so disappointing. It's full of cliches and ridiculous behavior. You have the virgin schoolmarm who is beautiful but doesn't know it and the high society rake who must marry a high born lady to pacify his grandaddy. These two conveniently get stranded together (without chaperone) during a snowstorm and within what seems like hours decide to have sex because, well, you can only make so many snowmen in a day, eh? Did I mention that she was a virgin? But the worst sin of this book is the fact that the writing is so freaking boring. This author usually excels at characterization and character motivation but this time it feels like she wrote it while on auto-pilot and it makes me so very sad."
2,quite simply boring!,"I was very disappointed in this book. I have read all of the Bedwyn family books by Mary Balough (and liked them all very much) and bought this one on name alone. I won't do that again. The characters were very boring and the interaction between Lucius and Frances didn't leave me feeling the romance. unless you feel the need to read all her books, don't bother with this one. It is usually very hard for me to put a book down once it is started but this took me 4 days to read."
3,I had to force myself to finish this one,"I finished it yesterday, and already I have forgotten almost everything about it except the title. I thought it started out well, but the story lost me after it moved from the setting in Bath to London. I lost interest in Frances as a character. I found it dragging. I knew they would end up together (that's the point of the genre, I guess), but it seemed to take too long and be filled with boring passages."
3,Poltergeist II:The Other Side.,"All the Main Protagonists are back,before the fiasco of Part 3,this movie sandwiched between them is at least decent but sadly lost potential,I love the Native American added to the equation,I Like the creepy Old Guy character but I found it a little too easy for the so-called ""Reverend"" to have been As Most Un-Holywood Portrayals of religion to be in bad taste(Despite being a Catholic myself and knowing that such Protestant Sects sadly exist.)Other than that,It just doesn't hold my attention as much,I remember being creeped out and sickened by the liquor-worm,It still isn't Part 1(The Original.)"
3,Not bad,First off these two movies don't compare to the first Poltergeist.Poltergeist two was ok. I enjoyed it till the dad threw up a corps. After that it got boring. But that was how I felt.Poltergeist three was pretty good. Better then the second movie.
3,2 in 1 is cool,"The convenience of having the last two movies in one DVD is great, and that alone earns the three stars. As for the movies. . . . .Poltergeist II is a decent follow-up attempt, but let's face it--it's hard to beat the first and original Poltergeist. Kudos for Jillian Beck's truly spooky portrayal of the preacher, it makes the film actually scary, in what's an otherwise gross-out FX flick. Adding anything else will ruin the plot for those who've never seen the movie, so let's move on to Poltergeist III. DON'T bother. The only reason to see this movie is to see the original stars Zelda Rubinstein and Heather O'Rourke (in her last performance--she passed away before completion of the film, and that explains the crappy ending) try to salvage a pathetic franchise going down that tunnel ""into the light."" Amen--rest in peace Poltergeist Legacy, but this trio deserved a better send-off."
5,Poltergeist II/Poltergeist III,"Great nice to both moives togeter for the same price Poltergeist II/Poltergeist III ,is going to get you, so get you popcorn and drink and sit back beware you never know................."
4,I tend to disagree...,"Everyone is saying that Poltergeist II was great but the third was awful. I tend to think the reverse. I first watched all three Poltergeist movies when I was eight. I was too afraid to go in front of mirrors for weeks after watching the third movie. Cheesy special effects, sure... but it is much more frightening than Poltergeist II which I thought was a joke. To this day, Poltergeist III remains one of my favorites. I'm still afraid of mirrors because of it and I'm now an adult!"
3,just in time,just in time for the holidays you have a dvd with two movies on it. Nice since you get two movies for the price of one. However since p-2 wasn't that great its a wash.Enjoy:David
1,2 In 1 Sucks,"I hate when movie companies put two movies on one cd. I hated the sequel to Poltergeist, but I actually liked the third one. So in order for me to get Poltergeist 3 on dvd, I have to get the movie I didn't like just to see the movie I want. Ugh!"
3,Good despite ''SEQUEL-ITIS'',The original pic was so good and so any sequel would have to be 'off the chain' just to equal. A good effort.
4,From back when Trudeau was still funny,"This collection of reprinted cartoons by Garry Trudeau is not one of my favorite books, but it does date back to the time when I rushed to read his strip every day. Baby boomers will probably enjoy re-reading and remembering. Younger people may not understand some of it since many of the strips deal with events that haven't been current for decades, but some are more timeless and still as valid today as ever.An aquaintance of mine (to whom I gave this book) using the Doonesbury books to teach his children about recent history. They don't understand a lot of the references, so he discusses the subjects with them and then they appreciate the humor and learn something."
2,Disappointed,"I can only recommend this book to people who are very into butch/femme roles or genderf**king in general.I appreciate that the editor is trying to appeal to a wide audience, but in doing so, she loses her mainstream readers.I'm not conservative about sex, but I also have no desire to read a story about a woman who prostitutes her girlfriend out to a male biker or a butch who has borderline nonconsensual sex with a hooker. If that's your thing, then you'll love this book."
5,"Great Blades, Although Quite Expensive","I have tried most razors on the market from older dual edge, single blade razors to the new three blade disposable razors (I have not tried any of the new quad-configuration razors, however.) Of all the razors I have tried, my overall favorite is the Gillette Sensor Excel. The combination of shaving closeness and relatively long blade life make this razor a good choice for most people.The bottom line is that these blades provide an optimum, smooth shave and last a long time, which is why I continue to use them despite the relatively high cost. The most economical way to buy these blades is in the 15-cartridge pack; so if you like the Sensor Excel like I do, this package is the best value you will find. I give the Sensor Excel five stars for technical merit, even though the replacement blades are quite expensive."
3,Batman Belt surprise!!!!!!,"I bought this belt for my son last Christmas. He was 3 years old. The belt constantly fell to his ankles and I tried many things to keep it on including sticking a folded towel between his back and the belt, I could not prevail against this belt. He was so disappointed. We returned the belt and decided this year He will be over 4 years old and maybe it will fit. If not we can try when He is 5 years old. Anyway you look at it the belt is a dynamic idea...but should of been designed for the 3 year olds of heart."
3,Very disappointed!!!,"My son earned this belt for finally being potty trained. It sat on top of the refrigerator for 2 months while my son would look dreamily up at it. He was so excited when he finally got to open it his 3 year old hands were shaking. He loved it, at first. Now he still loves it, but it frustrates him constantly. The belt does not fit around his waist. It is not even close to fitting, it constantly falls down around his ankles. He walks all hunched over when he wears it so it will stay up. I don't know what type kid this was designed for, but I can wear it, with a few extra notches to spare (and I am not petite!) He also gets frustrated because the ""gas pellets"" get stuck in the specially designed pocket. All in all this was not the great toy we thought is was going to be."
4,Bat Belt,"I got this belt for my 4 yr old. Its HUGE! I need to layer him up and put it on the last setting to stay on. Either that or feed him an entire box of hoho's/ring dings a day. That is a bit dissapointing. Other than this belt is 200% nicer than the belt that comes with the mask/cape/talking chest plate. (which is why we needed to buy this belt.) He plays with it maybe 2-3 times a week since recieving it from Santa. Would be nice if the company offered a delux set with all the nice masks, gloves, cape and belts vs needed to buy 3 sets from the same manufacturer just to get the right look.My suggestion is get the muscle holloween costume and get this belt. That would be the ultimate play costume...but I couldn't find the halloween costume around Christmas... so santa had to improvise and bring this with the other sets. The belt is nicer than the glove set and the talking chest plate set."
5,Bat Dad 2,"I bought the Bat belt for my son again. Now he is four going on five. I have learned that if I put the belt on him and pull it real snug past the last loop then use some duct tape for a few wraps, he can squeeze in and out of it real easy and it stays on him while he is playing. He loves it now. Bat tip. Pick a closet and hang a dark sheet down in the open doorway with a flashlight on in the closet. Then line up a few chairs with a sheet over them connecting to the closet entrance. Then hang a Batman costume with the Bat Belt and mask in the closet. Set some music playing from the first Batman movie. 1990. My son crawls through the chairs like a batcave entrance to find his costume waiting for him in the closet. Then he crawls back out to do battle with me while the music is playing. Sometimes I surprise him, he hears the music and runs to the den cause he knows it's Bat time."
3,Not durable,"I got this at Target years ago but within 10 minutes of play the flashlight broke. This upset me and I took it back, now I realise that I would have played with until it was destroyed. I wouldn't have bought it if I wasn't really little with money to burn a hole in my pocket."
4,Good and Interesting Book,This book gives samples and explanations about how many things in our life and nature where we live now are already mentioned and explained in the Quran. Many of those things are explained in Quran even before we have knowledge to know or understand them.
1,Nonexistent technical support,"It's difficult to rate software that won't install... I purchased this with a Sony ICD-MS voice recorder (at a premium), and when going through the setup (Win2000 on a Dell with plenty of headroom) encountered an undocumented glitch in the sample text recognition section. If you need this software, keep your fingers crossed that you're one of those lucky enough to have it configure correctly out of the box.Turns out if you purchase the software in a hardware bundle, tech support is $40 per incident. Even if you purchase the software on its own, you get one ""free"" incident, then YOU'RE on your own.I'd give a zero, but 1 is as low as the rating scale goes."
2,Un-naturally Not-Speaking,"ScanSoft says Dragon is ""fully integrated"" into Excel. NOT! It doesn't know about named-ranges or sheet names. It's difficult to select blocks of cells, and damn-near impossible to enter your own formulas. Docs say you can use ""compute <formula> end formula."" Absolute, pure BS!In Outlook, docs say the command ""Open Mail"" and ""close mail"". Dragon hears ""Open Male"" and ""close male."" Sorry, the message doesn't open! Docs: ""Check Mail"", or ""get Mail,"" results: doesn't work.Using Internet Explorer is almost impossible, at first. After a few hours, you can almost navigate dual web site.Great toy. But it does NOT work as advertised. Save your money! If you're not disabled, and have no need for voice recognition software, caveat emptor!"
1,Get ready to pay more later,"Dont expect any help from Scan Soft if you have any problems with this program. This is a huge and buggy program that will conflict with a bunch of different software since it has to integrate itself into anyh program that accepts text entry. Scan soft limits tech support to one phone call, $19.95 per call after that, even if your issue is ongoing. I was told to uninstall and reinstall (how creative) and on the reinstall found that the CD was corrupt. Replacement CD's are only $25 + $5 S/H. How nice.Scan Soft will not back up their products, and probably make more money on tech support and replacement for buggy and defective products.Looks good on the description, but good luck if you are not up and running right out of the box."
2,"Better than before, but still frustrating","Well, guess what? I'm dictating this review. Version 7 of the long-running dragon series is probably the best version. Accuracy has been proved, and integration with Microsoft programs is also better than ever. However, I still cannot recommend this product to most casual users. In command mode, it still makes a lot of mistakes, and the funny thing is, training it does not seem to make a difference. Placement of the microphone is very important. Incidentally, in the included microphone headset is very cheap. If you get a headset from Plantronics, you're likely to get better results.Also, talking to the computer for an extended period of time can be very tiring, and your accuracy will go down the more you talk and become frustrated. Once it starts making frequent mistakes, you'll want to shut it down.Now, can you spot the dictation mistakes in this view?"
4,One of the best swing bands of the era,"There's no doubt that the 1938-39 Artie Shaw band was arguably the best swing orchestra of that era. This collection, along with the 1938 and 1939, Vol. 2 CDs will give you an idea why. Jerry Gray's arrangements are top notch, with lush but swinging ensemble passages (take a listen to ""Lover, Come Back to Me"" as an example) surpassing, in my mind at least, many of the solo spots. There's a tendency towards goofy novelty numbers, especially when they involve Tony Pastor's vocals, but several of Helen Forrest's numbers (including the great ""Deep Purple"") are top notch."
2,Not enough hits,It was an ok cd. I expected to hear more hits on this 70's cd - but there are a few really good songs on it.
3,Doesn't fit regular cases.,"Low profile, what does that mean? They are way too short to fill the empty holes left behind from the slots at the back of the computer. Should have specified that in the description. Not sure what they will fit, but certainly not a regular case."
2,this is weak,i think this was weak exepted the song by mo thugs and layzie bone kuz they are da best im a wasteland warrior a mighty mo thug warrior gotz 2 give it up 2 layzie krayzie bizzy wi$h and my man fle$h cleveland ......... suka
5,THE BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD!,"I am a family member of Stephanie Greene, and I think this is the best book in the world! the story is captivating and extremely wonderful. I would recommend it to everyone, from 6 year olds to harvard scholars.PS: hi Stephanie, and Ol!"
4,Great sound,My husband and I really enjoy the Live at Lincoln Center CDs and this is no exception. High quality musicians executing standards in a strong tribute to Duke Ellington.
5,REAL MUSIC,"Just awesome, these guys are super tight! Amazing what happens when you put a group of real musicians together."
5,The Maze in the Heart of the Castle,"I read this book after I had read The Tightrope Walker by Dorothy Gilman, as it was referenced in that book. Even though it is listed as a book for young adults it is quite fabulous. A book with a moral and it makes you think. I loved it!"
5,My Favorite,"It's all here, all the stages of grief. The anger, the denial, the deal making, the acceptance -- all play out in an allegory built around a young man's adventure of self discovery. I read this book to my children, I have given this book as a gift when someone faces a horrible loss, and my children have since begun reading it to their children. I wholeheartedly endorse the book and pairing it with The Tightrope Walker just enhances the fun of cross discovery. I have not checked the publication dates for the books but I am sure The Tightrope Walker was written before this book and that's why, as one reviewer pointed out, there are scenes detailed in one book that don't show up in the other. I've read everything Ms. Gilman has ever written and this, hands down, is my favorite."
4,"Great, but where's the rest?","I have read The Tightrope Walker many times and was amazed to find out recently that The Maze in the Heart of the Castle was a real book. I thought it was well written and exciting. I can see where Amelia Jones felt personally connected to it. However, there are scenes mentioned in Tightrope Walker that didn't happen. Also what about the supposed sequel, In the Land of the Golden Warriors? Is it really coming? I hope so, because I think Colin's adventures in The Maze were just the beginning!"
1,BAD BATTERY / OVERHEATS,"I have had this computer for 2 years and from day 1 it's been below average. I should have returned it when it only worked for an hour on battery and was overheating. I just ordered a new cpu which I cant wait for because I can't use this Sony because the overheating causes the computer to turn off at random ...and I am on my 2nd cooling dock. To be fair I will say that when it works it's fine but it only works properly 15% of the time, the remaining 85% of the time I am waiting for a website to pull up staring at a blank screen.Please do not buy this computer, you will regret it...and oh by the way all of the decals on the top and bottom of the computer have melted off so I don't know the serial number or anything about the cpu!"
3,Keyboard letters fade. Battery good for less than 2 hours.,"I've had my computer since earl;y 2005 or late 2004. It has been a wonderful computer in every way. I am completely satisfied with the exception of (1) the letters on the keyboard have faded a lot... a few of them are not even visible. I believe the solutions are to buy a replacementr keyboard for $60 or more or to find stickers that go on the keyboard to replace the original lettering. It may be possible to get key replacements but from what I can tell the cost is very high.The other problem is a battery that only last 1 1/2 to 2 hours, not good for much of anything.Just because of the keyboard, I doubt that my next computer will be a Sony in spite of everything else working fine. This seems like a real defect in the design."
3,Meh,"The games in here are pretty standard. What makes the book interesting is the language used-reminiscent of an owner's manual for any tech. The actual ""Baby owner's manual"" is totally worth it with great information in a vocabulary that geeks can understand and might actually read. Don't bother with buying this one, borrow it from the library for a quick laugh and reminder of a few fun games for kids."
3,"Good for mechanically, technically minded","This book was creative in the way it was written, but not as informative as I would have liked. I got much more information from the internet sites I found about infants...and by just experiencing things with my son as we went. But it does help those who have never been around babies, especially if they are mechanically or technically minded. Great for laughs and for inside lingo when talking about your ""model"" (aka baby)."
4,Halloween Romance,"From the back cover:Verity Windsor was startled beyond belief when the dazzlingly handsome, wealthy, and charming Lord Nicholas Montacute declared himself her smitten slave. What witchcraft was at work to make a man who could have any woman he desired want to have only her? And how could a country miss such as she resist the spell that made her senses swim when this lord and master of sophisticated seduction took her in his arms?All her doubts about this man's hunger and her own melted in his first burning kiss...only to return with a vengeance when she found herself fighting for his heart against the ravishing Judith Villiers, who knew every trick of tempting a man. Verity could only hope and pray that this wanton widow's sensual sorcery could be bested by the mysterious magic of love..."
5,Theology For Beginners,"If you are sincere in wanting to learn the truth about the teachings of the Catholic Church, this book is one of the best in giving you the truth in a very easy to understand manner. It takes you below the surface to the real meaning and understanding of what Jesus Christ wanted his followers to understand about Himself and about His Father and the Holy Spirit. I highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to go deeper in understanding the teachings of the Catholic Church, and this is only the beginning."
5,A book I treasure,"Frank J Sheed's Theology for Beginners, is a book I have come to treasure, and have shared with many others, who have also come to value this authors easy writing style, and simplicity of argument. I found this book enlightening, and very satisfyingly logical in the arguments and examples provided in the text. Frank Sheeds writing style turns what could be an intimidating topic, into an easily readable test with an attractive style. I have recommended this book to many people who have also found its contents very satisfying. This is one of those books that sits in the section on my bookshelf for only the most treasure books. It is a really good introduction to understanding what Theology is and also for laying a foundation for future exploration or study of this subject. Read it. You won't be sorry."
5,"A clear, concise, readable presentation of Catholic theology","Frank Sheed presents very readable explanations of Catholic theology. His writing is replete with analogy and metaphor which make dogma and mystery all the more approachable. Anyone who can ""explain"" the Trinity the way Sheed does is a master."
2,Not an Introduction To Theology,"This book is OK as an introduction to the Cathechism of Catholcism, but not as an introduction to theology. I would be interested in an Introduction to Theology from a Catholic perspective, mind you, but this is not that either. I want to say the author treats you as being stupid, but that wouldn't bother me either - I like Cathocism for Dummies. This thing that bothered me most, was after reading pages and pages of lead up for each subject, and being referred back to reread of other sections, right when you think he's amout to say something, he says something like, great theologians have spent a lot of time thinking about this, and suffice it to say, the conclusions is ... . I can read the Cathechism for that, and skip the preamble.If what you really want is a summary introduction to the Cathechism with a mild Theological slant, then go ahead and get the book - you'll love it."
1,Waste of money,I don't know who is intended reader of this book. For me it was completely useless as an introduction to Catholic theology. Disconnected thoughts and poor writing.
2,For Catholics Only,This is a pretty good book on Catholic apologetics but very shakey on theology and downright pathetic on Bible understanding.Good only for Catholics who never pick up and open the Bible.
5,Yes this is not the Original Soundtrack,"I know, much to your disappointment. You where looking for the song ""For the one I love,"" which is the qpening theme of the original 52 episode series of Fushigi Yugi. You are probably looking at the song list wondering ""What on earth? I have never heard these before."" But If you have seen the 1st OVA Series (which is the first 3 episodes on the ONI DVD Box Set) You have heard the music before. Yes Yes Yes. It is the 1st OVA series soundtrack. Now you wanna buy it don't you. Just the piano on tract 1 is worth buying. Tract 9 is just an added bonus. Personally I love this CD. If you are a true Fushigi Yuugi Otaku It is a requirement."
1,not an excellent book,"I selected this book as the textbook for my course of data structure, and this book has given me a lot of troubles. Firstly, the pseudo code give by the book is sometimes wrong and the descriptions about the data structures are inconsistent. For example, if you have this book, turn to the page containing the merge sort pseudo code and give it a try. As another example, go to the tree section and have a detailed look at descriptions of the delete-min operations of a binary search tree, you will find the defects by yourself. Secondly, the language the author used are not reader-friendly, especially not beginner friendly. To some extent, it scared away my students. They kept telling me that ""this book is difficult to read"". I should have selected another book on data structure."
1,This music is HORRIBLE,"If you are a real Heavy Metal fan, you should be revolted with this. The greatest band ever makes of one of their best musics this garbage, called Unforgiven II. I don't know how they had the courage to ruin it to this point. Maybe it is because they wanted some more money."
3,"Side 1 is fine, but Side 2 should EMBARRASS the band!","The Unforgiven II is a song much like the original, Unforgiven, as far as the chord-progressions and riffs. The instrumentation and vocal stylings give this second version a more ""country"" sound and is less haunting than the first. It isn't for the fan that just wants to hear Seek & Destroy 1,000 times in a row. If you can get over the fact that Metallica aren't the same thrash-metal heads they used to be, this isn't a bad song. To my ears, the recording isn't as polished here as on the original Unforgiven. It sounds more raw. That isn't a complaint, just an observation. I WILL complain about Side 2, however. This is a poorly performed live version of an otherwise cool song: The Thing That Should Not Be. Hetfield's voice is so far off-the-mark it makes me sea-sick. The recording is mud too. Did Metallica approve this? Why?"
3,country+alternative!?,"Even though I despise country music and alternative rock, I like Metallica's creativity. hey, these guys are gettin older, if you did the same things over and over again for 20 years. wouldnt you get bored too? This song is good for all those alternative fans out there. Over all, this is good music, but not what I look for these days"
5,Cool Single,A cool single. The live tracks were great and the demo of the Unforgiven II was ledgendary. A great demo to have for one of the best metallica songs ever. This will become a rare single in time.
1,Disco Fever....,"This cd was pretty weak....Don't expect any of your ""classic"" disco tunes to be on here. It sounds more like studio musicians of the new millenium who just decided to put together a generic disco sounding cd. Not authentic at all."
2,Old Balloons,"Balloons were old and brittle, many popped instantly. The pump is barely strong enough to blow up the balloons. Not great. Shipped quick."
3,Easily pop.,"This are good, but they pop very easily but they are good for making balloon animals. Love it but they pop..."
4,I really enjoyed reading this book.,if you like mafia storries I would stronglly recommend this book. It is worth reading and much better than the movie.
2,Unbelieveable and rather obvious.,Not up to her usual standard. Somewhat unbelieveable even by Mafia standards. Rather sensationalistic.
3,Flash back to the 1960's...,"This 1968 book details the discovery of the Bimini Wall. Set in the psychedelic era, the authors are not scientists, in fact, the book begins with an impassioned defense of the merits of smoking pot. It's a quick breezy read that is long on reflection, short on detail, draws no solid conclusions, yet has some interesting pictures of the Bimini Wall as the divers investigate it. Yes, the authors were also followers of Edgar Cayce, and these days it's fashionable to dismiss the wall as simple ""beach rock"", but the pictures do make you wonder. The wall is so long and many of the blocks the same size that it does look as if they were cut to form either a road or harbor. Not the best book on Atlantis, but an interesting read that may or may not become more important historically later. It's also a nice flashback to the 60's."
5,Best blades for sensitive skin,"These are the best blades for sensitive skin. This isn't the first type of razor/blades I've used but is the best I've used. The smooth action of the blades minimizes the risk of bad cuts. The aloe strip on the blades leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized after shaving.However, I can find the blades a few dollars cheaper at Target or Wal-Mart than on-line."
1,nope.,"I can't see what all the hype is about these razors. I bought a large quantity thinking they would blow my old razor (Gillette Venus) out of the water. Big mistake. To me these are no different then cheap bics. Initially I was cutting myself constantly, which was never a problem with the Venus. Then the razor burn which was so unbearable that I had to slather my legs in aloe for relief. The irony is that I suffered this for no reason - they didn't even give me a smooth shave and after a months usage I found myself WAY more susceptible to nasty ingrown hairs. So I don't know if I just got bad batch of cartridges or what, but I think for people who have really sensitive skin this is a total waste of money! Back to Venus!"
2,Moisture Strip is Dry and Brittle,"These are the same great blades that I used for 25 years. I stayed with them for two reasons: the handle is super comfortable and easy to grip, and the blades are sharp with a perfect angle. However, the moisture strip on these particular blades is dry and brittle. The strip fell off the first blade I used. I'm on the second blade and the moisture strip is just as ineffective as the first although it hasn't fallen off, yet. My legs look like they've been through a paper shredder. I doubt I'll buy them again and learn to be happy with the new blade and handle designs that are on the market."
5,Love it!,"Best razor ever. I don't need 3,4 or 5 blades. 2 is plenty. Can't find the cartridges at the store anymore so I'm glad they are available online."
4,Sensor Excel,I can't find these razor refills anywhere but online and I'm afraid I'm buying them all! These are the best razors for me. I get a very close shave with them. However I'm finding that they do not stay as sharp as they used to. One refill used to last me a long time. Now I find that I have to change it out for a new one weekly. I'll still keep buying them though!
1,CA DNA Migrator 2007,"The program did migrate some of microsoft programs, and data files but very little else. It would have been easier to reinstall with the original discs. I would not recomend it. AlohaBob Ultra Plus, although costing more, is a much better program"
1,Piece of S_ _ T,"Someone ought to be fired for bringing this thing to market! Does not even come close to doing what they claim. They also claim ""Free Support"". This support consists of email support that didn't respond for 72 hours and even then didn't answer the question! I Had to hire an IT guy for three hours to straighten out what this software screwed up, and I still havent regained the look and feel of my old PC. Save your money and look elsewhere. This product is a disaster."
5,Oh let the kids alone,"Sure, I edited a book calledTeddy Bear Cannibal Massacreso maybe I'm a little biased, but I think fear is a good healthy thing for children. And even if it isn't, I grew up knowing that sometimes parents join mind control cults and force their children to drink cyanide laced kool aid.So what's a little airplane terrorism? The cat on the cover looks ok with it. Maybe we should just be feline."
4,Good Read if you like historical suspence,"The book was captivating from the begining. While parts of the story bend history (it is fiction), the events are believeable and the reader can relate to the characters. If you liked Pillars of the Earth and expect this book to be similiar, you will be disappointed."
4,The Key to Good Reading.....Follett,"Having been consumed with the masterful writing in Follett's Pillars of the Earth and World Without End, I've started revisiting all his novels. Although written over 25 years ago about a war that took place over 65 years ago, Follett's insightful characterisations hold up remarkably well. The master storyteller pulls you in and weaves a web of intrigue that will keep you involved until the final pages. Great read."
3,Very thrilling read,"I love the way I get to know so much about the history of each place Follet writes about. Even though the plotline isn't one of his best, I found this a very good read."
3,Great Book-Bad Kindle Conversion,"Don't get me wrong, Key to Rebecca is a very good Follet novel. However, I read it on the Kindle digital format and found the conversion from print to digital to be very poor. Some words were blended together, such as an ""r"" and ""n"" forming an ""m"" and other words were repeated. While I could generally figure out meaning through context clues, it was distracting at best. If Amazon is going to market the Kindle as being superior to print, or at least as good, it needs to work out some of the kinks on the digital conversions.Back to ""Key to Rebecca""- very good suspense book. Other Follet recommendations would be ""Pillars of the Earth"", ""Word Without End"" and ""Eye of the Needle""."
2,A Big Disappointment from a great author,"Having read and LOVED ""Eye of the Needle"", I was all too ready to embrace another one of Follet's acclaimed spy thrillers. Unfortunately, ""Key to Rebecca"" reads like a cheap romance novel. True, the espionage details are very-well crafted, and the chase scenes are nail-biting. But at the heart of the novel is a love story so soppy that it drivels through your fingers; not to mention that it's a yawning rip-off of Hitchcock's ""Notorious"". When unforgivable dialogue like that is tossed around it ruins the whole experience. Not to mention that the two most awaited sensual scenes are delivered in a hokey dialogue sequence and an anti-climax. (Re)read ""Eye of the Needle"" to see how it's really done."
2,Disappointed,"Not what I expected from Ken Follett. Too little ""action"", very little personality and his usual character development. I expect to be drawn in to the story, and had to struggle to keep reading. Probably won't finish the book."
2,not as good as his others...,"this book falls short of his other books. i found the characters to be uninspiring and follett just didnt grab and hold my attention with this book as he has done with his other books like pillars of the earth, eye of the needle, code to zero etc.still an OK read...just not one of his best books."
2,Hardy Boys Mystery,"A nice primer on encryption methods but otherwise only moderately interesting and unreasonably larded with sexual motivations - do we *really* need to know why the hero is so uptight or the ""feme fatal"" so randy? My greatest complaints are:1) the enemy spy is not physically gifted, is armed only with a KNIFE yet is easily able to defeat any number of multiple armed assailants fighting for their lives.2) the hero keeps forgeting his own PISTOL.3) though there are dozens of citizens on the streets, the female lead never thinks to simply yell ""help"" while she is being kidnapped (not a spoiler as this is predictable from about page three)."
3,The Key to Rebecca,"Interesting story. A little difficult to read on my Kindle because there were a lot of characters and sometimes I wasn't sure who they were, and on the Kindle I can't leaf back to look them up. Otherwise, I enjoyed it."
3,A good starting place for readers new to Mr Follet,Keeps the pace moving so you don't fall asleep while reading. Pushes the limits of credibility in some places but still enjoyable.
4,Good read,Although a predictable end! Still very enjoyable! Ken Fillet does it again! It is great reading these earlier novels -
3,None,i entirely agree with the reviewer who wrote ok until the last 80 pages. the plot is implausible and the ending is a joke-an embarassment to the author.
4,"Skillful, entertaining, well-written thriller","Skillful, exciting thriller with interesting, engaging characters. Pacing, Follet's strong suit, was superb as always.Flaws included [spoilers](1) The characterization of Sandy Smith seemed unkind to the point of maliciousness;(2) There was no real resolution to the Bogge subplot;(3) It was not that plausible that Alex would need to carry around the key. The instructions provided for the first encryption suggest the rule was simple enough that the key could easily be memorized;(4) Like in nearly all Follett's books, the plot winds up with a faintly implausible, complex climax. Here, I did not find Alex's kidnapping of Billy to be credible under the circumstances, although I suppose it is possible."
3,Key To Rebbeca,"This is a first rate spy and action novel with a bit of interesting history thrown in. World War 2 veterans and buffs will, in particular find it to their liking. This is Ken Follett at his spell binding best."
1,BORING,"I decided to get this book , based on some of the other reviews. But couldn't finish it. Just plain boring. I have read much better works of Ken follet."
4,The Key to Rebecca,I am enjoying the book. Ken Follett is my favourite author and I have read most of his books. This is as good asd the others.
3,Teaching Rebecca,"Interesting characters, fair plot but some sections were rather simplistic. All in all it was a good read and well written."
4,"Fun read, not a great novel","Set in World War II, you don't have to be a WWII or even a history buff to enjoy it. The problem with a lot of spy novels (and police novels as well) is that the bad guys are smarter in the beginning and the good guys are smarter at the end (or the bad buys shoot better at the beginning and the good guys shoot better at the end). Makes the outcome less fulfilling, and that is the case here. Didn't find myself identifying with our hero, and our bad guy starts out smart and ruthless, but does not maintain those qualities throughout.Thought the sex scenes contrived, the method they used to extract information from the British officer somewhat silly (let's hide in the closet, sneak out, blah, blah, and of course he will not suspect anythings up, and will take the top secret documents with him).All in all, I enjoyed reading it, but there are better books on Follett's shelf (Eye), and better books in the genre by others as well."
2,Weak replay of 'Needle',"Too much I didn't understand in this novel. Why didn't Vandam just order the houseboat destroyed while Wolff was in it? Why didn't he plant false information for Wolff to send to the German forces? Vandam should have been taken off the case as soon as he blew the snatch at the restaurant and fell in love with Elena. Come on, the fate of the Allies lies in some incompetent detective's hands!!Another Follett tale ruined by his infatuation with women and graphic sex scenes.The Good: Triple, Jackdaws, Eye of the NeedleThe Bad: On Wings of EaglesThe Ugly: Lie Down with Lions, Key to Rebecca"
2,Ok until the last 80 pages,"I like the setting and the writing. Sorry, but the wierd sex and how the plot is based on it is not believable.But I can forgive all of that. What I can't forgive is that the author dropped the ball in the last 80 pages. The ending is a letdown. Seemed rushed and not well thoughout."
4,A CD full of bar memories,"Love Seed Mama Jump is by far one of the best bar bands. They offer an electric live show showcasing original material and covers. This album offers the best of early 1997 in my mind. I think I saw them 20 or so times in 1997 and I heard them play the material on this album over and over again. It stayed fresh every time. ""Satelitte Freaky"" is a great song, that reminds me of the times when the night was almost over. ""Blink"" is a staple of the live show and gets rediscovered on the new album from Artemis.The only thing I dislike about this album is the production leaves the music a bit flat sounding. The songs are great and this album, along with the rest of LSMJ catalog, deserves a place in anyone's CD collection."
1,My child won't touch it,"I bought this for my son when he was 6 months, now he's 14 months and he still has nothing to do with this toy. I thought it was just him, but his playmate, a 14 month girl doesn't care for it either. It just doesn't interest them at all!"
3,OK Toy,"My daughter likes this toy because she can play with the beads just like at the day care. She enjoys the textures and colors. However, she has to switch to another toy once in a while because it is heavy. But she always comes back to it."
1,Not a good buy,My son has not liked this product since the day I bought it.It seems pretty pointless and does nothing to keep his attention.It hasn't been touched in months.
2,Giggle Ball,"My son received this toy as a gift for his first birthday. He played with it four a day or two and hasn't touched it since. I think it's a good toy for babies about 9 months old for the color and sound stimulation, but not for children very much older than that. I agree with one review that it's mostly just a rattle. You have to shake it pretty hard to make it ""giggle"". Otherwise, the giggle noise is very slow and sad sounding."
3,An okay toy,"There is not anything wrong with the toy is is durable but my one year old son ignores it for the most part. The toy has the right components color, moveable pieces, but I think the lack of sound at his age is why it does not hold his interest."
1,"Looks cute, but kids just aren't interested!","I thought this toy looked fun but my daughter played with it for a few minutes and then didn't pick it up again. I saved it for my next child thinking maybe she would like it but, nope, the same thing happened. Played with it for a couple of minutes and that was enough. It's currently sitting in a 'give away' box (looks new!)."
4,Actually a Good Toy,"I was surprised to see so many bad reviews for this toy. I happened to pick it up at TJ Maxx today and my son (6 mos) really likes it. I agree with others that the ""giggle"" is hard to hear (you'd have to shake the toy very hard), but the moving parts captivate my son's attention, which is great. Probably not a good toy for babies under 6 mos though (says 6mos + on the box)."
2,cute toy,"This toy is very pretty and it looked like it would be a great toy, but it really isnt. The giggle sound is practically non-existant, and you have to shake it REALLY HARD in order to hear it. When my daughter was younger, it seemed hard for her to carry around, its heavy! This toy didnt seem to hold her interest for long, but its been thrown around a LOT and its still in one piece!! I guess durablilty counts!"
3,Not Bad,"I bought this for my 9 month old and she likes it. The giggle sound is practically non existent, but she does like everything going on with the ball. It's large for little hands, but she enjoys shaking it to the best of her ability. She prefers the Discovery Ball (awesome toy), but this is not as bad a toy as other parents are making it out to be."
5,Giggle ball,The giggle ball is very sturdy and colorful and is sure to delight the new family member once he can handle grasping. Very impressed with the condition and quality.
1,Not so much fun,"It looks like a lot of fun, but my 10 month old daughter isn't interested in it. I try to give it to her, but she just doesn't even want to touch it. Save your money and give your baby the turkey baster to play with instead"
1,Bad Move,"I ordered two of these with different teeth as I thought they were to fit a 6"" Porter Cable saw. They do not.The arbor is too small?"
4,Diablo 6 inch blade,I use this blade in my Porter Cable Saw Boss circular saw. The blade cuts extremely well making a smooth cut with a thin kerf. The blade does seem to flex a little when you put sideways pressure such as to correct the cut line - I guess due to it being so thin.The durability will be determined later after I have more use. It is a great price value and I will continue to buy these from Freud if they holdup as I get more use from the blade.
5,Cuts wood like butter,"I am using this for my 6"" Porter cable boss saw. Perfect fit, hard to find in local stores.. Cuts wood like butter.. Awesome!"
4,A good anime series,To start off I'm not a huge hardcore anime fan. I enjoy it and and bought this as a total shot in the dark. I found it to be quite good. It's not as aggressive as other series out there. This is a good series to start for someone who is looking to start into anime.
1,This anime is a porn fest. Not for kids.,"I played the game so I thought the anime might be fun, but I was oh so wrong. Do not buy this piece of crap anime if you have kids. It shows just how far Falcom has grown loose in its morals to sell us cheap porn. Had I known the anime was chock full of this crap, I would have never bought it. Plus, the anime itself wasn't very well-drawn and the Japanese voices of the characters didn't sound like the games at all...The seller was awesome though..."
1,Language select option does not work,"Was really looking forward to watching this only to be upset when I popped it in. I tried to change the language from english to japanese but, the function does not work on the disc. Also, when I attempted playing the movie despite that it gives me subtitles along with the english language. This is extremely annoying since the dialog and subtitles do not match and I hate watching anime in english in the first place. I will be returning this and if possible I will get another copy to see if it was just a problem with that disc (though I have never experienced anything like this with any DVD or BD). If it turns out that it was just the disc I'll amend this review. Until then I can't give a faulty product a good rating."
3,Missing something...like other discs???,"I rented this movie and am not sure if this is the same thing amazon is selling but it has the same picture on the disc as shown. Unfortunately it doesn't show how long the disc is, it's a rental, but after watching the movie I spent some time looking for another part to this since it seems there should be more to the story. It does not seem complete.The fighting scenes and story were good...if you can get over the one character having a ""I can fight you and win"" attitude without actually being able to deliver.I also have to say that I liked the way the story was drawn with the exception of all the characters having those awful slits for mouths. And what is up with those noses? It really distracted me from the story."
3,"Not great, but not bad either","I believe that the other reviewers are being a little harsh. I have surveyed a good deal of the Klan literature, and found this book actually ""fairly"" good in comparison. Do I think that it is unbiased or totally accurate? - NO. But it is better than most current academic research, which when dealing with a topic such as this goes out of its way to condemn the Klan. From the standpoint of organizational history, this book is the best that I have come across. Wade's social analysis is suspect however. I do recommend it however, for anyone interested in the internal power struggles and organizational history of the Klan. The Klan literature which Wade includes is also fascinating."
1,This book is garbage.,"With the exception of the appendixes, Wyn Wade has written a book so obviously biased in favor of anti-Klan propaganda tha he may as well have not done any research at all. A telling mark is the fact that Wade dedicated the book to his ""Radical Republican"" grandmother. Wade glosses over the horrors inflicted upon the White population of the South during the reconstruction, choosing instead to do everything but pin knighthoods on the carpetbaggers, scalawags, Yankee imperialists and their negro henchmen. Klans of later decades don't fair much better as Wade manages to portray them as either idiot yahoos or psychotics. Wade neglects to mention the many good deeds of the Klan and fails to differentiate between activity of legitimate members of the Invisible Empire and that of criminals hiding behind the orders hoods. Wade is a propagandist of the worst kind and, if there were any justice in the world, he'd be tarred and feathered and hung."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"It may look like something totally great, but in actuality it's not even worth a penny in my eyes. For one thing, everytime you speak into the microphone it dosen't recognize practically any of the words you say, even numorously repeated. And plus it brings up weird error messages, maybe because I have XP, but as the benevolent forwarner that I am, spend your $100 dollars on something more decent."
2,"Funny, but inaccurate & inappropriate","These are the kinds of comments that are bound to get you a punch in the nose or worse in many parts of Latin America. They are humorous as satire. However, the Spanish comes across as literal translations of the English comments. It ends up sounding like a debased form of the language that doesn't even get the ""wicked"" points across accurately. With few exceptions, the Spanish comments were word-for-word translations that don't mean very much in Spanish. Waste of time."
2,Does not automatically re-pair to my Blackberry 8100,"I bought this because I wanted a BT speakerphone that turned on and off with my car. I previously used a Motorola T305 that had to be manually turned on when entering the car, and wanted something automatic.The Scosche unit turns on automatically, but takes a long time to turn on after power is applied (even with the AC adaptor in-home) and does not reconnect automatically to my Blackberry 8100. I must navigate to the Blackberry's Bluetooth menu, select ""SCOSCHE"" and re-connect manually. Every other Bluetooth device I've used with my Blackberry (several models of ear-headsets, the aforementioned T305 speaker-phone, and a Parrot speaker-phone, all re-pair automatically within SECONDS of being powered up.What a disappointment."
5,Very good monitor,"Really good monitor. No interference, works fine in 2-story home and uses rechargable batteries which are included. Overall good value for money."
5,Perfect,This Book came in near perfect condition. Came with a color photo of the cover. Sweet book! lots of cool pics! also.. I am going to get the cover and the Self taken photo of Charles bond taken at 18000 tattoos. Great read also. America!!
5,FINALLY!!,"Back when I was a child I used to listen to TURN THE LIGHTS DOWN LOW with my father and twin brother. We listened to this album over and over. It was probably our favorite album in a huge collection that my parents owned. My father and twin brother are both gone now, and it tugged at my heart when I saw that this album was finally available on CD. I honestly never thought I would see it released, and now I can listen to it just like when I was a kid. Turn the Lights Down Low is one of the greatest songs Marty Robbins recorded, and all of the selections on the album are first rate. I always thought it was too bad that he wasn't more widely recognized for this album. Listen to it and just enjoy the talent of one of our greatest male singers!"
4,A Music Stand,Works well and hold a fair amount of weight. Easy to set up and easy to fold up. I appreciate the black finish since I sit in front of a ceiling to floor window to practice and there is no glare form the stand
5,Cheaper through Amazon,I buy this every year as a gift for my Aunt-in-law since her husband died and no longer is there to get it for her for her birthday.
2,Poor packaging,"When this arrived both bottles had leaked making the boxes unwrappable. This was a gift for my grandpa, who used this product growing up. Both bottles were about half way empty due to the leakage that had occurred."
3,"Interesting, but just OK","As a 25 year fan of ELP I was very curious to here this tribue CD. While there are some excellant takes on old ELP stuff, the selection of material fails to demonstrate the diversity of ELP. The best reworkings stick close to the originals (Tarkus, 1st Impression, The Barbarian, etc) while the more interpretive readings (except for the Sheriff) are annoying or lack the calm and contrast of the originals. Mostly this cd demonstrates how talented ELP was/is and how difficult it is to improve on their legacy"
3,Hits and Misses,"Sentiment regarding this tribute album is remarkably consistent: Robert Berry hits, Trent Gardner misses. One doesn't have to do a note by note re-creation of a track to be faithful to the spirit of the original -- and Berry doesn't -- in his production of the standout track on this compilation, Karn Evil 9. Gardner, on the other hand, renders tracks like Toccata melodically unrecognizable. Happily, to supplement the good bits of this record, a third ELP tribute album on Hypernation Music is due out shortly. (The first, on Italian label Mellow Records, featured such gems as ""Living Sin"" sung entirely in Italian.) We've got thrills and shocks, indeed."
2,Jeeezzzz,"Talk about pretension! This music seems to be a spring board to showcase uninspired, general purpose Berkley School graduate fast metal licks. Looses all the subtleness and texture of the originals. Although there are a few shining moments (Hoedown, Glenn Hughes) most of the rest seems to make little sense (Toccata) or is downright pathetic (Time and a Place). It CAN be down much better than this! Emerson DESERVES better than this!"
3,ELP Tribute Great? No! but it's a good start.,Well I haven't really hear the whole album just bits and pices. I dont like what berry does for the album. I never like it when he was with them before and I don't now. I do how ever like what the Dream Theater boys do for this album. They add some nice comfort to me I guess because I like Dream Theater. I like Simon Phllips as well as the guy from Jethro Tull. I liked Asia and UK so I do like what John Wetton adds to it as well as Geoff Downes Some of the people I don't know to well. Like the guy from Mr.Mister who the heck is that. Is it there bass player or there drummer or keybord player. I just dont know why the guy is and why he would be on this album. This is just my two cents worth. Oh and the could have included better songs. I am not saying what they put on was bad. They just needed to take some out or made it a double disk.
1,This sucks,"This album is so bad that ELP may get back together to ensure that additional ""tribute"" albums are never produced."
3,Paradox is right,"Many of the other reviewers are right. Why have a covers tribute album that covers covers? Did't ELP write enough of their own music to qualify? I think so.Why couldn't they do some of the accoustic songs - From the Beginning, Still...You Turn Me On, etc.? Why not choose something else like Pirates, Brain Salad Surgery, Trilogy, Karn Eval 9 (3rd Impression), et al?Many of the tracks on this album I would consider of pedestrian ability. There are a few outstanding cuts - Karn Eval 9 (1st Impression), The Endless Enigma, and Tarkus. These tracks are absolutely wonderful. However, most of the rest are quite forgettable.If you have an open mind, and are an ELP fan, get this. If you think that it is sacrilege to try and cover ELP, don't get this. If you want a few great versions of ELP, you'll like this, for the most part."
3,A good story enhanced by excellent animation,"The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers was a ""children's"" cartoon that aired in the mid-80's, produced by Robert Mandell, the show had some great authors such as the late Brian Dayley, Mick Farren and Christopher Rowley writing and editing the episodes. It was an excellent show that still lives on with its fans, no matter what age we are! END"
5,enlightenment for the venturesome person,"What a great thing it is to discover that there are races who admire our struggles and wish us the best for our future. It is always good to hear encouragement for us in the stressful lives that we live and this book give us a bright hope for our near future. A wonderfully poetic read, start to finish."
1,Nope,"A disgusting substitute for pizza crust. Tastes nothing like crust or bread. Always has this burned, chemical taste to it, even if you eat it without heating."
1,As horrid now as when I tasted it 15 years ago,"This is garbage. If you: Think Wonder bread is good bread and Diet Soda actually tastes better than regular then you may like his chemically tasting garbage. My mouth and tongue actually violently rejected my ability to swallow this poison. As an aside, Freschetta recently came out with their version and believe it or not it is VERY TASTY!"
4,Where are the breadsticks?!,"Maaan, what happened to the Boboli breadsticks?? That was like MY DINNER for years. I can't beleive they discontinued those. My heart will go on..."
4,Pappa's Progression,"Pappa continues with his strong progressive sound, forcing his way forward. Pappa's track selection includes music from breeder, humate, narcotik, and hybrid. Pappa keeps this cd moving with Breeder's Angel Dust. Great song with strong powerful beats. Hybrid's Kill City is awesome. Soft and full of vocals yet a powerful and progressive song. This song takes the icing on the cake. In this cd Pappa keeps the energy flowing and continues with his strong momentum, never slacking up. Pappa definitely has a lot of talent and a driving mixing style."
3,Ped Buckle,This is heavier than I thought and the clip is not conducive to most cars. You have to use the extra part and slip it on the seat belt.
3,Too Long dog is hooked in back seat and is still getting in to the front.,"better then what I had. Good enough till I can get better. I can't shorten this enough, she can still get to the front seat."
2,heavy and not very 'pet-friendly',"I returned this tether. It is heavy, has a large metal connector that us difficult to use. It 'weighed' my 20# mini poodle down so he could barely move. Might work nicely for a large dog."
5,works great,"this tether works great you can attach it to your cars anchor points or the seat belt, works great to keep your dog safe from sudden stops or god forbid an accident happens"
5,A Salvation during Hurricane Katrina!,"When I left my home to ride out Hurricane Katrina at my sister's house, I had no inkling that soon we would be running for our lives. The next morning we were frantically fleeing New Orleans. I did not have my crate with me and Susie May, who is NOT a good traveler, was in her seat belt harness hooked to the PetBuckle Tether. We were in the car for ELEVEN HOURS straight and she was perfectly content and able to lie down and sleep or look out the window with ease. It was a godsend and is honestly the best money I have ever spent on her. I don't know what I would have done without it!"
1,Dangerous Clip,"I used this for several weeks without any problems. When I returned home recently, I unhooked it from my youngest dog's harness and went around to the other side of the car to unhook my other dog and then planned to let them both out the same car door. In the maybe 15 seconds it took for me to walk around my car, my youngest dog stepped on the clip part of the harness and her toe and paw pad became trapped in it. I'm not sure how to describe how she was stuck but the tip of the flexible part of the clip was pushing into one of the pads on her paw from the bottom while the heavier curved metal top part pushed down on top of her toe. It took about 20 minutes for me to free her paw from the clip and it was difficult to free her without causing her pain. I ended up destroying the clip in the process. The clip is potentially dangerous, the rest of the belt is fine."
2,Could be a good product,"I'm not sure what car this was designed for, but it doesn't really work well in any of ours. The LATCH clip won't clip to the anchors in an 04 Jeep Wrangler, 99 Civic, or an 01 Saturn SL1, which means using the included strap for each car. It is also very short, and I don't have much confidence in the clip that goes to the dog's harness, at least if an accident were to occur. It does keep the dog in the seat, which is an important part."
2,Not the best...,"We ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Fudge for a gift and it arrived as described however the box contained a small re-freezeable ice pack that was way past being frozen. The ice pack and the fudge were warm to the touch. I sent an email to customer service for the item and never heard back from them. Guess customer service isn't a priority. Would probably not buy from them again, but be your own judge."
4,Metallica Sticker,"Very fast shipping, made it here before some other items I had ordered the same day. Very pleased with the product. Thank you for the awesome addition."
5,Classic Sci-Fi at its best!,"This is, as you can see by the title, a compilation of short stories. It is probably the first non-Star Trek Sci-Fi book I read as a child and hooked me on the story-telling capabilities of Leigh Brackett. The stories pretty much cover the gamut of man-vs-machine, man-vs-god, man-vs-man. They also address racism, slavery, the despair of being only human in this immense galaxy and the hope and delight in being human in this immense galaxy. The writing style is haunting. The titles are evocative. Try ""The Lake of the Gone Forever"", ""All the Colors of the Rainbow"", ""The Citadel of Lost Ages"" or my personal favorite, ""The Shadows"". These stories still make me laugh and cry and I am now 38 years old. I hope the publishers will wake up and do a reprint of this book someday."
4,Fantastic photos!,"Costume resources from this period tend towards drawings from period magazines, and use highly stylized model forms. This great collection of pictures shows a wide range of people, in a fairly wide range of clothing types. The limitations of period phots are that the clothing is almost always the fanciest outfits the person owns, and does not reflect day to day wear. Other photos are clearly theatrical costume, but the author has clearly identified them as such, even where the oroginal information is missing.As with any black and white source, colors are left to your imagination, but the details of finsh and construction that can be gleaned from the photos makes this a necessary tool in researching clothing of this era. Teamed with a Harper's Bazaar drawing reference, and an accessory reference, and you are ready to start making your own victorian clothing!"
3,Sketches are better,"I will enjoy looking through this book endlessly, but I actually prefer sketches to actual photos because the detailing is much clearer. I good book added to my library."
2,Definitely not comprehensive...,"This book is a very low-level introduction to jodo, primarily Shindo Muso Ryu jo. It definitely won't provide good enough instruction to learn any of the basic techniques or kata, and it isn't very comprehensive, only useful for the extreme beginner while they're still in the beginner stages. The book also only covers the forms chosen for the Seitei Jodo set, ignoring the traditional form sets. A much better book would be the book ""Jodo: the Way of the Stick"" (aka La voie du baton, I think, the book is split into both English and French sections), which provides a much more comprehensive set of explanations, techniques (covers omote, chuden, and ranai: the Seitei forms are miscellaneous kata chosen from these sets), and background on SMR jodo and budo in general."
2,Could be alot better,"While I won't recomend this book as a must have, it is good for reviewing what you have been taught by a reputably instructor. It's ok for helping one remember terms and as a rough approximation of the actual Katas. However the pictures show poor posture and little or no actual idea of what is happening in each Kata. Don't bother with this unless you study Jodo. It's too bad that this is the only book available in english."
4,The book is a valuable resource during the beginning years.,"While the book alone cannot be used to learn Jodo, it is a valuable supplement to training. It helps to refresh one's memory in the early stages of training, and allows one to see a clearer picture of more intricate kata."
1,Consult with care,There are a number of technical errors to watch out for in the text and sequencing of pictures. This book is mainly good only for the historical anecdotes.
2,Dissapointing period movie,"The only interesting aspect of this movie is the location of the events -Montelusa ,Scicily; and associated to the very populr Montalbano series.Unfortunately Montelusa landscape is only revealed at the initial scenes ,otherwise not shown during the film. The story ,although ""historical"" , is completely predictable and developed as a combination of comedy and documental.The actors were given the task to develop "" cartoon characters"" which did not work well at all."
5,Great book,"Great book, well written and exciting. Couldn't put it down and looking forward to the next book in the trilogy."
4,"Good, for a change in material...","I will start by saying that I have not read any of the other titles in the Dragonlance realm - that's right, not one of them. I picked this book up on a whim, I was looking for something in the Fantasy genre to read as opposed to ANOTHER Sci-Fi book. That being said I was pleasntly surprised by this read, I rather enjoyed this book and have subsequently recommended it to some of my friends. The characters were ones that you can picture in your mind and the settings left me with wonderful images of great mountain ranges and incredibly majestic castles. I felt that this book was worth the 7 or so dollars I spent on it. All in all a good read."
3,Mediocre at best,"Not that great I'm afraid. The story line needs serious rework in order to be decent. The unerlining concept of this book is sound, but the execution leaves lots to be desired. Read something else unless your a die hard fan.If you like books like this one, might I suggest another I've recently come across. The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. It's another fantasy adventure sure to please. I highly recommend it."
1,Legal Research and Writing,"Pissed. Didn't recieve. Have to cancel, make a claim and reoder. Just started to use Amazon because everyone raves and this is my third book I've order and now I'm unsure as to whether I'll get the money credited back to my account to purchase again.As for the marketing of the book. The search gave me 5th edition but if you open up the image, it says 4th edition and now I'm wary about ordering again for fear it's the incorrect edition for my class."
3,"The shape was ""ok-ish"", not ""good"".","Cup stains on the pages, highlighter marks here and there, the cover page bended slightly. It's ok for the price; but it's definitely not in a ""GOOD"" shape."
5,Legal Research and Writing for Paralegals,This seller provided a pristine used copy. I highly recommend this seller and will purchase with confidence from the seller again.
5,Legal Research and Writing for Paralegals,"I am currently a paralegal major at a community college in Maryland. This was not the book assigned for my legal research or legal writing classes, but I borrowed the book for the purpose of a research paper for English class. I found the book to be extremely helpful in my research process and I will purchase a copy for myself. Ms. Bouchoux is very thorough in illustrating the process involved in researching and writing clear and effect legal documents. I recommend to anyone studying to be a paralegal and/or attorney to purchase this book to use a reference guide."
2,Almost impossible to read,"It is almost impossible to stay awake reading this book. The prose is extremely dry and long-winded. I've had much better luck with online legal research tutorials; because of the nature of the Web, the information is much more concise and readable."
1,This seller is an absolute joke!!!,"We ordered this item two monts ago and we haven't still received the book, the seller charged us a lot for that and is not answering our emails! Complete Loss, I don't believe we're ever gonna get it! It was supposed to be a gift for someone who lives abroad, we are planning to go away and pay them a visit and now instead of handing it as promised we' ll come empty-handed!!!Please avoid the seller! Not reccomended!"
4,Classic Urban Soc,"A must read for any urban sociologist--but if you are looking at this page, it's likely that you know this already. If you're not a trained sociologist, this is one of the most classic works from the Chicago School of Sociology & this book will give you a very good sense of the roots of American urban sociology. An easy read, and although many of the ideas have been challenged or are out of usage by now, its still a wonderful read to understand how researchers conceived of the city during the early period of urbanization. Enjoy."
4,Nice option to relax,"This is really a great movie. That kind of movie to watch when you need to relax. I do recommend this one. It is not a Wonderful production, but it is a nice option."
3,"Nice A/V upgrade from the DVD, but that's it.","This is concerning the forthcoming Blu-Ray release due out on the 10th (I received an advance copy for review). The A/V upgrade is notable and probably worth a purchase for fans of the film eagerly waiting to retire their DVDs. Unfortunately, no new bonus features are included, and the theatrical version is also absent. So if you prefer the ""Director's Cut"" and appreciate a good transfer / sound mix, it's worth the modest MSRP.But that cover is hideous. Looks like Meg Ryan is posing with a wax sculpture."
5,Pretty nice,I got this sooner than expected which made me happy. It was a little cheaper than other blades I have used while being just as good if not better quality.
4,Works OK,I use it on my Hitachi battery powered trim saw and it works pretty well. The only question will be how long it lasts.
5,Great blade!,"I got this blade for my 18v Makita cordless saw after reading the other reviews. This blade gave a much better cut than a 40 tooth blade I bought from another manufacturer. I used this blade to make numerous types of cuts ( crosscut and rip) in Brazilian Cherry hardwood flooring without a problem. And the pre-finished flooring did not chip, etc. This blade gives a very fine cut. Would not hesitate to buy this blade again. And it is reasonably priced to boot. If you have a cordless saw, do yourself a favor and get this blade. You will not be disappointed in the price/performance."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS EXPECTED,I GENERALLY USE THESE BLADES FOR INITIAL CUT IN SHEET GOODS. WHILE THE CUT SPEED IS OK THERE IS A LOT OF SPLINTERING ON THIS PARTICULAR BLADE. WITH A PREVIOUS BLADE I USUALLY HAD TO FINISH TRIM LESS THAN 1/4 INCH. WITH THESE IT IS SOMETIMES UP TO 3/4 INCH. THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ON HOW MUCH YOU CAN GET OUT OF SHEET.
1,One Star for 50% price increase since last Sept.,"I use my Makita cordless saw alot and have purchased many of these saw blades.I have no problem with the blade itself.The last time I purchased this blade it was under $10.Come on, a 50% increase in a few months.I will buy this blade elsewhere from now on.Thanks Amazon."
4,Hats off to these ladies from Osaka Japan!,This album...while cleaner than their earlier recordings lacks a little of their unique immature edge. This album is a great example of the Japanese Punk rock that we all know and love! ....
2,OVERBLOWN,"This maxiseies is one of the most overblown and overrated superhero stories ever.It is basically just a massive fight scene and the most interestingpart of the story, Doctor Doom usurping the Beyonder's power is underdeveloped and lacks resonance.The way Doom is defeated is also unsatisfying. It is not a worthless comic but it is pretty bad."
5,the summer blockbuster of comics,"Ok so it's not deep and the writing while great, is not watchmen level, but the whole thing is just fun, it's a series of battle with some great character moments and even long lastign effects like venom's alien costume showing up for the first time.i really loved the moments like when Hulk lifts a mountain, doom uses his normal tricks to take over, the rifts we see and firnedships formed.don't go looking for the most deep, just one of the most fun crossovers ever, and since it was it's own mini, you don't need to read all the rest of the monthly issues unlike some crossovers, this was very self contained to the mini, the fallout was then put in the monthly books, but you don't have to see those."
2,Far From a Classic,"Too many battles with lame villains, no decent character development; bizarre plot developments are never explained, especially with Galactus. The X-Men are very poorly treated, with Wolverine being overly aggressive and Colossus falling in love with an alien woman for no reason. Cyclops, Rogue and Storm don't do a whole lot; neither does Spider-man, although he does get the famous alien costume (in three panels--not worth getting the book for). The Thing's turning into Ben Grimm is never explained (or maybe it is in the next ""awesome"" crossover). All in all, you should only get this if you're a big fan of Captain America, Mr. Fantastic, Dr. Doom or The Molecule Man."
3,Not worth the premium paper it's printed on...,If you are a fan of comics and itching to read the first megacrossover that marvel dished out then you should grab this reprinting. There are some pivotal moments in the course of some characters played out in this tome... But if you are looking for well rendered art and a story that makes sense then you'd best look elsewhere...
2,pretty awful...,"it took a lot for me to read past the second issue, secret wars is that bad. in comics there is old-school kind of cheesy 60s style marvel writing, like kirby and lee stuff, which even though it's not graphic more-adult-oriented comic fiction like some of the good stuff of today it's still really great reading. secret wars is an example of trying to write like that and failing miserably. it's cheesy, it's bad, the ideas and the whole premise of the story is stupid, it's just all around poor. there are much better comics works out there for you to read. also there is something very wrong as others have stated with the printing of this book, some pages look like a elementary school class copied them on a library printer."
4,Standard Resource for Christians,"Solid, dependable but dated exposition of the original Fundamentalist position (ala Machen) before the term got stolen and mis-apportioned to a more narrow sect within the Christian community. Packer clearly states that the term is not ""useful for Evangelicals today"" (1958) and he was and is right. The book is well worth reading, along with Machen's ""Christianity and Liberalism"" for a strong sense of the basic challenges orthodox, Evangelical Christians face. In the post-modern era those basic challenges are still present though now characterized in different dress. As Packer says (pg. 42)- ""The problem of authority is the most fundamental problem that the Christian Church ever faces."" Absolutely true and now as much as ever. Packer's work has abiding interest for anyone seeking to establish themselves within the flow of Christian apologetics and self-understanding."
1,Blah....,"This book is diluted full of misconceptions and premonitions by the author. It's curious to see that someone knows how the media works, despite never having set foot in a news room.Public relations is a powerful tool. However, media relations is only one very small part of it. The author needs to go more in depth on intricate parts of public relations. And the fact that the company (I went to their website) makes more than 30,000 phone calls a month sounds like the OJ Simpson legal defense strategy (throw spaghetti on the wall and some will stick).I like the concept, but the book --- blahhhhhhhhh."
5,The BEST RAZOR they ever made!!! It;s NOT discontinued!!!!,"after a 4 day search I was able to call schick @ 1-800-Shavers, THIS ITEM IS NOT DISCOUNTUNUED they still make it but its up to your local store whether or not they want to carry it!!You can buy the razor for $3 and the refills from either:www.nationwidecampus.comwww.hocks.comMost walmarts have the refill cartiges.Call schick and tell them to promote this item again!! It was introduced in 1977 and people are still using it, this is something good!! Revisit this razor you all!!"
5,What happened!!??,"WHY has Schick stopped selling these??? Are they CRAZY?? I have been using this for years also and it IS the BEST razor out there!! Come on girls, if we ALL email Schick, maybe they will bring them back!!"
1,"!Basura! (=""Trash"" in the Spanish language)","Comedy is supposed to be culturally-specific. They say successful American comedies often flop abroad. So maybe I wasn't appreciating this as a foreign comedy. This work was predictable with bad acting and bad actors. At one point the couple buys a car and the car is sitting in their living room!!!! In the US, it's college students, not newlyweds, who are unwise with credit cards. This is a terribly weak film, but perhaps those familiar with Latin American cinema would appreciate it somehow. This is no ""Like Water for Chocolate"" or ""Dona Herlinda and her Son."" This was just some mess. You've been warned!"
4,Celebration of Two Faiths,"This beautifully illustrated book provides a easily understandable story about a young girl's relationship with her two grandmothers of different faiths. A well put together book with a topic that is not often dealt with by authors. My only criticism is that the grandmothers are somewhat stereotypical. Otherwise, a useful tool for interfaith families."
5,AWESOME!!,"Chris..Chris..Chris!! where have you been? This CD has to be on of the best investments I've made in a long time! His voice puts you in touch with your spirituality. I know I've never heard anything so great in all my life! Chris, don't stop what you're doing.. the world loves you!!"
5,Beggar's Paradise is one the best recordings of the year.,"Beggar's Paradise by Chris Rodriguez is one of the best, and in my book most anticipated, recordings of the year. Chris has honed his craft over many years, many recordings, and many major tours as a guitarist and vocalist. In fact, you are probably a fan of his and never knew it. His debut CD is fresh and innovative, and still offers something new after many listens. Highlights here include: Mercy Day, Beggar's Paradise, Your Love, and Waiting. Okay, so they are all highlights. And, you can be sure, the best is yet to come from Chris Rodriguez."
5,Great Find!,I found this CD on accident while looking at other CD's. I recognized the name immediately as he is a guitarist for Keith Urban. I've seen him live with Keith many times and I was thrilled to find this. It just blew me away and is one of my favorite Christian CD's. I actually met Chris this summer after a Keith Urban concert and I pulled out this CD for him to sign. He was blown away that I actually had a copy of it and he signed it for me.I highly recommend this CD for your Christian library! He is an awesome guitarist and vocalist.
2,"Good idea, Bad quality.","Good idea, bad quality. It's like someone cut a seatbelt out of a car, slapped some velcro on it and poked two holes in it."
4,Great Program BUT could be a bit more user friendly,"Okay, I've been trying a lot of French programs lately, and I have to admit, this one (probably) has the best programs and resources. HOWEVER, it is not user friendly--it has a bunch of inexplicable little icons scattered here, there, and everywhere--and unless you go into the ""user's manual"" and print it out like a handbook, you are going to be stuck and unable to explore all the possibilities this program might offer. Unlike Learn & Speak French, which is so intuitively designed that a child can operate it and proceed without much instruction, this program, however well-organized, is NOT for those souls who prefer to skip over instructions and therefore waste several frustrating hours trying to figure things out on their own. IF you print out the manual, or at least the pages to those sections you are utilizing, you will be pleased. The flashcards are fantastic and speech recognition and interactivity is superb. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!"
5,Solved my browning and doneness problems,"When I used any sort of metal pans, no matter how I adjusted oven temp or what coating or lining I used I continued to have quick breads come out too brown on the outside and often not completely done on the inside. I finally switched to these and am very pleased. Breads come out very evenly baked. I reduce the oven temp by 25 degrees but use approximately the time recommended by the recipes. Spray them first with non-stick spray. Pans bake well and clean up easily."
3,"Typical, but not quite right","I am looking for a loaf pan that is a true rectangle shape. This, like most others, is much wider at the top; more narrow on the bottom. I returned it to Amazon, no problem."
3,not a space saver,"I asked for and received 2 glass loaf baking pans as a gift. But these pans take up too much space in my cupboard.Stacked one in the other they are 5 inches high. Anyone know of glass loaf pans that when stacked are less than 5"" high?I'm getting to old (to want) to remember where my pans are if I have to re-arrange everything in the kitchen to find space for these pans.I have not taken the paperwork out of the pans yet."
4,Angela has comedic potential,"This is one of her last efforts - and it might be her best. As usual, she's cute as can be, as she delivers lethal leg kicks to the baddies. Her efforts to enlist the aid of two old martial arts experts in her training are hilarious. In the final scene she dances her way to victory - one sexy number. The only fault I can find is that when she dresses as a boy, she's too pretty to be believable."
3,Too Much Dancin,I've seen kung fu movies where The actors sort play or dance around but most of the time it leads to a more serious confrontations. In this movie it never did. This was more of a kung fu Ballet than a martial arts movie. I love Angela Mao Ying but boy this movie is not one of her best.
3,"Old ""Skool"" Kung Fu!!","This flick was directed by Jackie Chan. ""Dance Of Death"" could have been a 4 star easily. I though this flick was just o.k,,,,I'm a big fan of the ""crazy horse kung fu"", which is very rare in kung fu movies. This movie highlighted that kung fu style very nicely I though,,,however, I felt it went over-board in the final fight scene, which resulted the fight became extremely boaring,,,I swear,,this went on for approximately 20 mins. That is why I ended up giving this film a 3 star. However, the choreography was nicely done."
4,Lots of details,"Great book with lots of explanations. Just wished there was some colored pics of the breads to make. I now use the ""sponge method"" as suggested in this book - along with my Kitchen-Aid mixer (current fad). A book for all to read."
5,Smooth cut,"The Freud Diablo makes a thin kerf (blade cut) smooth cut. I have used other brands such as Craftsman, Black and Decker, etc. this is a premium blade and worth the money. Delivered on time and in top condition."
5,Sweet little devil,"I have had really good luck with Diablo 7.25"" blades on my DeWalt circular saw. The thin kerf really seems to make a difference: these are really easy to push through the material. Nice clean cuts. And they clean up pretty easily, too. I've used the 40T and 24T blades with good results."
3,Fine for the short haul,"While you can't beat these Diablo blades for cross cuts and short rips, if you plan on any long or repetitive ripping, LOOK ELSEWHERE. Specifically, as with all thin kerf blades I've tried, there is no escaping the warp and wander once it heats up. The only solution for long ripping duty is a heavy, WIDE blade. I've tried half a dozen brands, and regardless of the cute little heat dissapation cuts and grooves built in, they all fail the warp test. However, for the short haul, particularly circular saw use, vs. the table saw, it's a good cutting blade."
5,country boy,"I used the blades in my circular saw to cut 2"" rough cut lumber. Riping 2""x12"" was no problem at all. Great blades at a great price."
5,nice blade for finish work,I needed a finer tooth blade for finish work and this blade has worked fine. I have no complaints about the product.
2,"oh, the pain...","It's truly dreadful, but not dreadful enough to play often, and the price is steep for just one track. As the liner notes state: ""This once-in-a-lifetime recording could well become a collector's item""; true, but that doesn't make it worthy of the cost."
1,Perverting an advanced tradition of sexual yoga,"Stephen Chang has ambitiously perverted every major Taoist practice, including acupuncture, dietetics, herbology, meditation and qi gong. He invents terminology, claiming to translate from the Taoist tradition, where no actual Chinese antecedents exists.Two practices has centre stage in Chang's elaborate system. It is the ""deer exercise,"" or anal sphincter contraction, leading to an earth shattering ""valley orgasms."" The linking of Huan Jing and Xiao Zhou Tian, marking the culmination of traditional sexual practice, is neglected except for a single brief paragraph."
2,Infinite wisdom of Taoism doesn't balance imperfection,"Chang's assessment and understanding of human sexuality is undoubtedly mixed within a worldview that understands everything to be divine in principle. However, the reality is that although sexuality is beautiful and should be both the medium for pleasure and the power of progeneration, it is imperfect and should not be made into a lapsed sequence of religious simplicity. To understand true sexuality one must first understand his/her Creator and the purpose for his/her creation."
2,Not thrilled,"Received it in good shape but the book was not as I expected content wise. The book did arrive quickly, though."
3,"It's ok., but Jolan Chang's books are better.","I would give this book the grade ""D"" - satisfactory. Although it does provide the reader with some useful information about Taoism, Stephen Thomas Chang`s ""The Tao of sexology"" can in no way be compared with the books ""The Tao of Love"" and ""The Tao of the loving couple"" by JOLAN Chang (don't mix the two authors up!). I would highly recommend to buy and read rather Jolan Chang's books if you want to get a real profound introduction into Taoism. Here in Germany Jolan Chang's books are much more popular than those of Steven Thomas Chang."
5,This book is HOT!,"Award winning author Sarah McCarty has once again produced another amazing piece of literature! Jessie is a woman filling the position of cook on Mac's ranch, looking for man to fulfill her every desire, and Mac is just the Alpha she needs!I have yet to read a McCarty novel that I didn't like and MAC'S LAW is no exception. It was a very intense and memorable read. The passion and sensuality just smolder throughout the novel, and the growing love between Mac and Jessie makes the story all the more romantic. If we all could be so lucky to have an Alpha like Mac fulfilling our every desire!MAC'S LAW is longer than many erotic romance books at 356 pages, but flows so smoothly that I finished it in only a few hours! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read! And as MAC'S LAW is only the first book in the UNCHAINED series, we have more sexy Alphas to look forward to!"
3,"Sex scenes are hot.....the story, not so much.","In a nutshell: Woman moves to old west, well, kind of. This book seems like an old western but it is a contemporary. Woman answers ad for job as cook for a rancher. Rancher doesn't want to hire a woman because of the horny old men working for him. Woman makes a deal to prove herself. Ranch hands love womans cooking. Rancher like woman. Woman likes rancher. They have sex. Rancher holds back anal sex from woman because of mommy issues. Woman leaves rancher until rancher realizes he needs woman in ""every"" way. They reunite to have all kinds of sex....The end."
4,Interesting but has it's flaws,"This series describes in a general way the nature of the battle. However, many details are missing. For example, Fedor von Bock is listed as the German general for the battle but had been relieved well before the 6th army was anywhere near Stalingrad(dispute over tactics with Hitler). The city of Vorohnez is also mispronounced (this is nitpicking)and there are some other minor flaws such as showing general military pictures rather than finding relevant tape of the Stalingrad area. Also, the monumental struggle within the city needs much more time than the broad-brush this series provides. To really get to the heart of the battle, a book is more worthwhile than any video.Even with these faults, I find much that is valuable in this series. The discussion of the general strategies and frames of mind of the leaders and soldiers is very valuable. A cursory look at some of the weapons is also interesting. Despite the flaws in this series, I wish I had the entire set."
2,Computer graphics and film representation,"A fair video that explains, in a very general way, the battle with graphic maps and lines. The film portions are disappointing. Many are repeated, and some I doubt were even taken near Stalingrad - just generic winter fighting scenes. END"
3,Not what I expected,"This video, though a novel idea, is not great. The video could have had more vocabulary and the accent is Calucutta Bengali, not Bangladesh Bengali--an analogy would be a student learning British English instead of American English."
2,Severe Eye Strain!,"Tetris Worlds provides several different ways to play Tetris. All the games are addictive, fun, and a lot more complicated than one would think.However, the blocks are very difficult to see! The production staff created a washed-out, pastel look to the blocks that makes them transparent. The colors are often impossible to differentiate. Every time I play, I get a headache from squinting so much!It's a shame that this defect ruins a perfectly good game."
5,A Fun Game for Everyone,"I don't know what it is with all the lower reviews for Tetris Worlds but I had to write a review to speak up about this wonderful game. Yes, it is not the original Tetris. It was not meant to be a copy of the original game. What it is, though, is a fun and addictive game. You will find yourself losing track of time if you play this game. The graphics are nice and the sound is great, too. I found this game to be entertaining for an older gamer like myself. I am sure that young gamers will enjoy it, too. We need to stop comparing sequels to their predecessors and start appreciating games for their own value."
3,Very hard to get started.,I found the game very hard to pick the type of game you wanted to play. If you played multi-player and reached a certain level the worst player would still end up beating you. Didn't like too much.
2,Boring,"Tetris is awesome. I could play that time waster all day - but something is amiss with this game and it manages to make me not want to play.It could be the loud thumping synth and techno music that plays in the background on infinte loop, or it could be the fact that they attempted to add a story to Tetris by adding strange ""creatures"" that speak a more annoying version of Animal Crossing's babelese, it could be that the colors look like they have been washed out and are difficult to tell apart, or it could be that there are barely any modes to play except marathon tetris games.I think the real reason is that they just botched it. Its Tetris in some ways but there's just something off about it."
5,not stereotypic,"This book seems to be a wonderful portrayal of a Native American family and community and their culture and history. One point that I appreciate is that the author tried to stay true to the Choctaw cultural activities, arts and lifestyle in the beautiful drawings and text. The author did not meld several different tribal cultures together as a homogenous ""Native American culture."" The message of the book also helps young readers to respect the sacrifices and values of the tribe, as well as to question the way Euro-Americans treated them in the past. A treasured book."
4,Nice Blade,I'm not a professional woodworker by any means but this blade makes a very nice clean cut on my table saw. I'm going to buy a couple more. Highly recommended.
3,I feel like I was cheated,"You get 1 blade and have to send $3 for shipping in order to get the 2nd blade. The offer sounds great, but when I got just 1 blade in mail and seen I had to send $3 to Freud along with orginal recept, plus proof of purchase bar code, I really felt cheated. Why don't they just give two blades at one time if they want to really have a buy one get one sale.I am sure the 1060 blade is a very good blade but I have not tried it."
5,Excellent!,I recently built an entertainment center out of oak using this blade. This blade performed flawlessly! Very smooth cuts! Highly recommend!
2,not what I was looking for,"I own most of the other Chanticleer albums, and I love their delicious harmonies. The sweet singing I was looking for was lacking here, at least in selections four through eleven. In fact, the harshness (could a couple of tenors be taken out and gently shot?) rattled my teeth. Perhaps this was the intention, but I'm getting to the stage when I don't have time to waste. I want beautiful music, and I don't think that's too much to ask."
1,Awful,"I love Chanticleer...but this album is just plain awful. My husband also loves Chanticleer, but he skipped track after track....you can't call them songs or music. Very little in this album sounds like the Chanticleer we love. What happened?"
5,BSET CSI YET!!!!!,I love the show and just can not get enough of it. I know others will love it as much as I do!
3,CSI Las Vegas Season Five,Package came wrapped in shrink wrap although the second disk was scratched so badly it does not even play. Other disks seem to be fine though.
4,C.S.I. THE FITH SEASON,"it has been a long time to wait for the new serie, lot of actions from ours favourit team. new muders investigation. agreat from the kidnaping of nick , the games is a foot to find him as a sherlock investigation is on that serie too great great"
5,CSI CHANGES DON'T HURT A BIT,"Initially I was disturbed when the writers decided to promote Macklie (Mark Vann, superb in his obnoxious portrayal) and split up Grissom's team. But in spite of this change, the show is still the best crime series on the air, and on DVD!Stories are a lot more complex, and unique: a man who lives secretly as a baby; a brother who offs his brother for revealing his ""secret""; a killer mold and dry ice...and so on. But what a finale! Directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""Grave Danger"" shows why this series is so good: tight writing, almost unbearable suspense, and a cast that gets better with each episode. Paul Guilfoyle, George Eads and Jorja Fox, particularly, but they are ALL super. Please get the sixth season out on DVD soon. I'm going to miss this show!!!"
5,The show is a learning tool,"I must admit it's the only show I watch of it's kind that I've learned loads of unknown information from. Thanks to this show, I still won't eat pork. Never-the-less... Season 5 is probably the last of the great seasons and the most explosive. No pun intended. The cast are great together even when they are apart. The lack of development of certain characters is about the only flaw I found up to this DVD release. I keep reading that Tarantino directed Ch-Ch-Changes as well, mystery that no one really mentions it. If you want one of the most enjoyable Seasons of 5, pick up this DVD set today!!"
4,"Good, but chipped","I LOVED IT, and it came, I believe, a day sooner than projected. The case was chipped, in shipping, I presume, but I wanted to start watching the show. Thanks for the fast service!!"
2,CSI: The Original,"Arrived in a timely fashion. It was described as Brand New, but the plastic covering had small tears which was not mentioned in the description. Won't know if the DVD is good until Christmas Day; it was a gift."
5,Great Service,"Great service for this product. Received earlier than thought, and the product was just how the seller described in. No problems!"
4,I like certain shows like this,"I do not always like police series but this is a different type from most so this is a good series overall, I just wish that they would do more bonus features. I especially like the features that use real CSI to explain what is going on in the show."
4,Print too small to read,"I skimmed throught his book. It seems very intersting and informative, but the print is just too small to read all the way through. It is giving me a headache."
4,Add a quarter ruler,"I haven't had a chance to use the ruler yet, but I am certain it will work exactly as indicated. I will not be using this notion until after the first of the new year."
3,Intereting but not very distinguished,"The second issue in the chronological survey of the 12 symphonies of Alexander Moyzes (1906-1984) gives us, well, nr. 3 and 4, again in more than serviceable performances from Ladislav Slovák and the Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra.The five-movemented third (based on a wind quintet) is a charming work, but perhaps not very distinctive. The fourth is on another level of inspiration altogether, bring gravity and even a sense of urgency (though the finale is, as in many of Moyzes' symphonies, a let-down).Sound quality is not the best, it is in general slightly boxy, and it seems that the technicians even change settings in midwork at some points. Still, this is a worthwhile release."
1,FAULT ON VIDEO MASTER,"For the first 55min ,at the top of the screen is a very bad Flagging (Bending) problemthat looks like came from the original VHS Full Frame tape they used.This used to be a common problem back in the VHS days.Quality quite poor.It shouldn't have been released like this.The film itself ,Fair one from Bruce Le."
1,Archaic information and way over priced,"I have read several project management books over the years andthis is the first I've found to be worthless and the first I've everreturned.I personally had two big challenges with it. First, theinformation is very out of date. You cannot expect a book written 1992(I believe) to be highly applicaple to today's technology. Second,...[the amount I paid] is way overpriced for a ""paperback""(I'm still trying to figure out what ""text book binding""means) that is as skimpy on information as this. Close to 10 pageswere dedicated to listing project management software that doesn'texist today.For the value of your dollar, you could probably gettwo other books with 4x the information."
1,worst machine ever,"turned on clipper for the 1st time it was noisy, adjusted the power screw same problem, it just wud not work"
3,Worth for your money,It is easy to use.Definitely you need other person in your home to correct your hair at the back.It is really useful for those who have kids.
2,"Good accessories, not so good trimmer","At first when I got the product I was like ""whoa, this is heavy and seems pretty heavy duty"" unfortunately the cutting is not so great.On the plus side it comes with a bunch of accessories that are great but not worth the money to get some scissors and such."
3,Product looks good but the weight is the concern,"Hi,I bought this item after many research. When I use the product, it was not easy to use(Of course my wife would cut for me). She does not like this one. So we returned the product without using a single time.Thanks,Ramesh"
1,BAD AND EXPENSIVE,"IT WAS A MISTAKE TO BUY THIS PRODUCT. O.K. I TAKE THE BLAME.I HAVE SEEN SOMETHING SIMILAR IN MARSHALL OR IN ROSS, BUT I DECIDED TO TAKE THIS WAHL 79524 BY THINKING IN THE BRAND AND THE PRESENTATION, BUT I HAVE USED IT JUST FOR THREE OR FOUR TIMES, AND IT HAS LOST THE EDGE. MACHINE not include all the attachments that ANNOUNCED"
5,Great Product,This item works just as you would expect it to. It is easy to use and powerful. It payed for itself after 4 haircuts. I would recommend it and it is really an investment from all those overpriced hair cuts.
5,yup they work,"Cut my hair about 3 times so far, work great every time. I haven't really used all the varying sized guards, as I keep my hair really short. Cuts hair in one pass. I used to use some crappy $10 clippers, thought I was ""saving money"" but what I was really doing was giving myself a crappy hair cut. It's definately worth the small price difference between the crappy budget clippers. If you like your head, invest in these very decent clippers."
4,Good clippers,"Pretty good clippers, came with lots of tapers. Worked well. Wahl is a good name in hair cutting (I know that's a given, but yea), so if you're really hesitating 30 clams to get some shaving action, all I have to tell you is that I never looked back, so you probably wouldn't either. Yay for hair cuts!"
5,quality product,"i love this product...i have very short hair...guide # 3. I give myself a haircut every 4 or 5 days in less than 3 minutes with this clipper. Right out of the box my 4 yr old son demanded his haircut, apron on and all!...without even reading instructions, i used a # 5 guide and it was easy. The dvd is helpful for longer haircuts, sideburn trimming, etc...made of rugged heavy steel...even the included scizzors are not cheap....for the $27 it is a great investment...over time will probably save me hundreds of $."
4,Great clipper system for short hairstyles,"This Wahl clipper system is my new best friend, I hate going to the barber and paying for a haircut that only takes them a couple of minutes or so. This kit was much easier to use than I thought it would be, came out w/ a nice haircut that looks as good as anything I've paid for recently. The DVD is LAME, there's no need to watch it if you've ever had your hair clippered before. I don't dig the ""left and right ear guard"" pieces either. But overall, this is easy to use even without anybody helping you out."
4,So Far So Good,"I've only had it a few weeks, but it has worked well so far. Goes right through my hair. I only wish the cord was a little bit longer for my bathroom."
4,good clipper,"The product was pretty good, just be sure not to put too much pressure on the No.2 clipper and/or make sure it is properly attached :-\"
4,It's great,"Sounds like a hair clipper in a salon as opposed to the normal ""at home"" ones, such as the one I had before. Great cut, you don't have to keep going over sections several times."
3,Good not Great,"The wahl 24 piece deluxe clipper kit is a great bargain, my only gripe is the inability of the trimmer to cut to close to the scalp! If you want a close all around cut with a bit of fuzz this is the trimmer for you, If you want a smooth close cut get the andis 11 piece set (also sold on amazon)."
4,"Great quality, lots of attachments","Excellent quality. Comes with a ton of attachments, which can be overwhelming but if you know what you're doing they really help. This is probably the best clippers I've ever owned. Just be sure to clean and oil them properly and it should last for years. Comes with a cd-rom instructional video but I haven't checked it out."
2,Useless JUNK piece,"It's not worth of buying this JUNK peice... Its so big, cant handle oursleves. I don't feel like using it anymore."
5,"Great Shipping, beautiful condition",I got my package two days after I placed the order which was a lot faster than what I expected. The package was in brand new condition like promised. Amazon is definitely top on my list for online orders.
4,Use all the time.,"Have had for a few years now. Use regular, has held up good. Several attachments. Would recommed."
3,Good but...,"The machine itself is of very good quality and would deserve the attachments to be of a similar standard instead of the cheap rabbishy plastic made in China that don't even fit properly at times. I had to send for a replacement of the number 2 comb that didn't fit. They did send me another one from Wahl very promptly, however, the fitting is not that much better I'm afraid."
5,Excellant hairclipper for home,"This is an excellant clipper, and a great bargain for home hair cutting. Out standing quality."
2,JUNK!! Terrible for shaving your head!,"I bought this to replace a Conair clipper. I shave my head once every other week, and just need a basic clipper that does the job.My problem is this: when I use the slider to adjust the trimmer height to the closest cut the blades bind and do not move freely anymore. This means that I cant get a close cut. I oil the blades after each use so this is not the problem.Additionally, after having this clipper for only about 6 months I find that it bogs down on some patches of hair. considering that this is only a week or two of growth this is not acceptable."
4,WORKS FINE,"The explanation that came with how to due a haircut is poor, but the product is great. Has all that you need to maintain a great look without a barber."
3,it's heavy,"It works. I haven't used it enough to say whether it's durable, though the thing is so heavy it feels like it's made of solid metal. Given how infrequently I need clippers, I wish I'd gotten a cheaper model, even if it's partly plastic. This one is just so heavy that it's unwieldy for a woman to hold or maneuver."
1,What a waste of a good motor!,"Product obviously had a good motor with the way it violently shook my hand when I tried to use it, but the blades didn't cut my hair. It simply tugged on my hair every few seconds, causing it to take me an hour just to shave my head, including a few nicks on my neck. It is possible that it could have just been damaged during shipping, but I wouldn't try this clipper ever again."
5,Clipper review,"I have used the Wahl 79524 3 times (actually my wife has used it on me) since recently purchasing it. Simply stated, the item works better than I had hoped and is very comfortable. I had been concerned about pulling/pinching etc., but there is none of that. It is actually nicer than going to the barber, not to mention much more convenient. A well produced instructional video comes with the product. I highly recommend this item."
5,Quality Product,Got tired of paying $15 every trip to the barber so I got my own machine. I made a good call here and so will you if you buy this.
4,great for the price.,"this is a great trimmer. it does not get as close as in the salon, but it does a good job and does not over heat. i would reccomend this to anyone."
4,Good value for money,I have no experience with other clippers to compare this with. It worked as advertised and pretty easy to use.
5,Works fine,"So far, I've used it to do close-cropped brush cuts. For this, it's worked as a champ. The blades seem to cut evenly and without fuss. I'd recommend it, and the cost is reasonable."
4,clippers worth a look,"This is the most comprehensive hair clipper set I have ever owned. And I have owned alot of them. The only drawback I see in this set #79524 was there was no attachment for hair lengths longer than 1"" included with this kit. I am a poor man that raised 4 boys who are now men. Believe me I know this is quality. I am able to cut my own hair with these and the instructional DVD that came with the set was excellent. Not only do I say buy it I did. I am pleased."
4,Good Product,This product is a good purchase for the price. I bought it for my husband and it does the job well.
4,I'd rate it 4 stars,"It's a good product. I didn't need so many accessories. I just wanted the very basics. The accessories came with it were too cheap and low quality.I am satisfied with the whole thing, the product and service. Thanks."
2,Decepcion,"Si bien las interpretaciones de los cantantes y de la orquesta son correctas y bien llevadas la ""mise en scene"" deja mucho que desear. Escenarios inapropiados, vestuarios completamente neutros e inadecuados y sobre todo movimientos absurdos de los solistas empujando sillas de ruedas con maniquies representandose ellos mismos o a los otros personajes. Se desvirtua totalmente la belleza poetica de la obra de Debussy. La modernidad llevada hasta extremos absurdos. Es decir, fastidio total."
4,I'd recommend the Gillette Good News Plus razor ...,"I'd recommend the Gillette Good News Plus razor to family and friends. The Good News Plus gave me a clean, close shave. The Lubrastrip is great and creates a definite advantage over other razors. However, the product would probably perform even better if it had a pivoting head."
5,Delight with Sandra Bullock,"I enjoy all type of movies, but when it's about comedy, my mind turns instantly to this movie. I've lost count of how many times I've watched this light movie. I'm sure I know almost all the dialogues and yet I still find myself laughing once and again at the hilarious scenes presented in Miss Congeniality.Sandy Bullock manages to play at first, the most un-female character, FBI agent Grace Hart, who is adequately named by Victor Melling (Sir Michael Caine) as ""Dirty Harriet"", nothing more accurate. But its thanks to non other than Caine, that Bullock transforms into Gracie Lou Freebush, Miss New Jersey and candidate to win Miss USA pageant.This movies purpose is no other than to entertain and give the audience a good time. I'm pretty sure it fullfills it undoubtedly. Sandy Bullock is funny without even trying and no other actress could have pulled out this movie the way she did it. Quite delightful indeed."
2,Miss Congenialty is fluffy and sweet,"This movie ain't great art, and it's really pretty silly. Sandra Bullock is wonderfully charismatic, and saves what is really an ordinary, forgettable film. If you don't care for Sandra Bullock, then don't watch this movie.I'd rank it ""right up there"" with Love Potion #9.:)Kristine"
5,love this movie!,"I may be a bit biased because im a huge Sandra Bullock fan. This movie is funny, has drama, and has action, and a little romance. It pretty much has everything to make it a hit!"
2,Disappointing.........,"I almost bought this DVD but decided to rent it first. I'm glad I did....I promptly cancelled my DVD order. The movie is okay-at-best. If any other actress besides Sandra Bullock starred in this movie, it certainly would be shelved. Sandra plays a sloppy, unattractive FBI agent....and overacts in the process. The movie just tries too hard for laughs and fails. It's just not believable nor funny to see Sandra snorting when she laughs, stuffing her face while ketchup is dripping everywhere, eating with her mouth open, dressing sloppy & not brushing her hair, walking like a hood, talking with poor grammer, and the list goes on. I guess the major thing that bothers me is that she has no clue that she's a social joke yet she's an FBI agent so that implies she has some brains. The two aspects just don't mix. I think Sandra is a major talent but this movie isn't her shining glory."
1,I'm so tired of unfunny movies like this one.,"What a waste of otherwise highly talented people. This movie is an embarrassment from beginning to end. The premise is good and, with something other than slovenly writers, it could have been great fun. But the lazy bums decided they'd give thinking a pass. Or perhaps they handed off the work to a couple of equally dumb pre-teens who find pig-snorting Sandra Bullock stuffing donuts in her bra hilarious. Even if you're able to watch this for free--my advice to you is DON'T BOTHER."
3,Pretty good movie,"This was a hilarious film! I really enjoyed it. It was a lot better than I first expected it to be. It is not a family film, though. It is more of a 13+ ""click flick.""Rating: PG-13 Parents Strongly CautionedFor mild violence, references to *** (but nothing too bad), and there are a couple of cuss words in here.It is worth renting, but not buying."
5,Great Movie!,We love this movie! The quality was wonderful! We are really enjoying downloading movies from Amazon - it's been great!
3,I don't get what the fuss was about,I gave it 3 stars because it's the usual very predictable nonesense that Hollywood puts out. It was like a movie from the high school drama club. Sandra Bullock was fine but the movie as a whole lacked much interest.
5,Way to go Sandra!,"SandraBrings a pack house performace in this movie. This is by far one of my favorist movies that she did. My favorite part in the movie is when she is in the blue dress and they are presening her and she falls. She said,""I'm okay I'm in a dress and armed don't mess with me or something like that. But the best part of the movie was at the end when the girls give her an award and she said,"" I really want world peace."" This movie is for fans of Sandra or not but it's a good movie. How I know it's because I watch lots of movie that are on the max or hbo. So I love this movie and I think everyone needs to watch it once you just might fall in love with this movie. If not that's okay but it's just the best of movie that I think the women did for her caree.ThanksRoz"
4,Michael Caine is worth the price,"Sandra is Sandra (a good thing, here), but Michael Caine makes it all work. And William Shatner was perfect as the washed-up master of ceremonies. Harmless fun."
4,I CAN'T BELIEVE MORE PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE THIS FILM!!,"I thought this film was hilarious! The lead characters play their roles convincingly, and the plot is solid and funny. Some people call this film fluff, but in my opinion, its not. Fluff is a Julia Roberts movie ('Sleeping with the Enemy' excluded). This film has more substance ( and more of a plot) than a simple fluff movie.Miss Congeniality is a comedy that loves to make fun of itsself. It mixes satire with light and dark comedy perfectly! Don't miss out on this film!!"
3,Better than you'd expect,"Premise was a little shaky, but the physical humor and amazing transformation of Sandra made the movie worth watching. While I feel they attempted too much to be serious in parts, overall the movie is very funny and worth sitting down to watch."
5,Miss Congeniality and the Beauty Queen,"I would have to say that I love this movie for two reasons. First, the talent competition of the contestant making baloons reminded me of a real Miss America contestant singing she wanted to be a secretary. It was really bad talent and hard to believe someone would win a state beauty crown by making balloon animals these days. Second, I remember watching a runner up to Miss America making faces when she lost. Miss Texas just was wonderful in her dissapointment scene. This was hilarious and moved along very well. 100 points out of 100/ 5 stars."
4,4.5 For A Funny Movie,"I really think Sandra Bullock is a great actress and I have heard a lot of good reviews so I decided to watch this and it was pretty good. Although it was predictable and somewhat ""ordinary"" this movie made me laugh a whole bunch of the time. If you want laughs, a mystery and some cool music definetly get this movie. You'll love it!Overall: Great! Go and watch it, you might just end up buying it! :)"
2,bullock fan,The only reason this film even got two stars from me is that I love Sandra Bullock. She's always watchable. Everybody in the film is watchable and even likable. The plot is supposed to be silly and it was. It all just seemed to go on and on and on. Didn't do much for me.
5,Sandra Bullock is amazing,"This is a great movie that has everything: drama, witty conversations, humor, action, and pretty pageant gals. Sandra Bullock is hilarious, and this movie really brings out some more of her great comedic talents. It also brings out her beauty as an actor.Miss Congeniality is about an undercover FBI agent becoming a beauty pageant queen for New Jersey for security reasons. But becoming a beauty queen takes much work and coercion. All I have to see is that you got to see this movie, because it's both hilarious and touching."
5,MISS CONGENIALITY WAS A FUN MOVIE!!!!!!!,"I like this movie and not for the beautiful and amazing Sandra Bullock,but it was a fun and feel good movie!!!!! The actors were amazing and it was nice to see William Shatner be in a funny movie rather then seeing him in his old days when he was on Star Trek the series!!!!!!! I do recommend seeing this funny movie and trust me it will make you feel good too!!!! Sandra Bullock you rock!!!!"
4,Miss Congeniality,"This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson, who had seen it before and requested it. Apparently, he enjoyed the movie or wouldn't have asked for it for Christmas...."
5,"Ms Bullock, you rock!","Although I have more respect for my battered Strats than I do for Hollywood stars, I, like most decent human beings, am moved by your profoundly generous gesture in the wake of the staggering Asian tsunami tragedy.I humbly bow to you for doing something that should make the filthy-rich folk in your country, including your totally clueless leader, squirm in shame.From now on, I'm going to make an extra effort to appreciate your work, especially this swell comedy which reflects your fabulous personality more truly than you could possibly know.Give on!"
4,Not it's potential.,"This movie had the the potential of a very funny comedy. It was just a couple feet away from the award of me granting it 5 stars. However, I still believe it one of Sandra Bullock's best movies, and definetly a keeper."
5,Great from start to finish!,"I loved this movie. It was very entertaining all the way through.My husband and I usually spend quality time watching movies and to our delight, this was one of the best we have seen in a long time.This is a movie for everyone."
5,LOVED IT!,Very funny and a nice comedy to watch. I really Look forwad to watching number 2. Sandra Bullock was fantastic!
5,Love it,"Hilarious movie and always a classic. Sandra Bullock and Michael Caine are always great and very entertaining in this movie,"
3,Light comedy but...,"Oh well, I can't say I liked it or hated it. I find it to be very much like a weekend TV movie. The comedy is light, the acting job is well done but we never saw Sandra in a such role before. So if you are looking for sexy Sandra, you'll be disappointed. But still she proved to be a great actress not to look sexy!The main weak point is the overall plot... it is so silly and weak that gets you bored and lack interest all the way until the end. Oh yes you enjoy few laughs but one thing for sure, this movie is not for keep."
4,Good movie,"A great movie with underlying tones. Sandra Bullock is great in this movie. Gracie is an FBI agent who has never really fit in as a girl, in fact all of the people in her office think she is quite unattractive.Now comes the irony and humor. The FBI has a good lead that there will be an attack at the upcoming Miss America contest and guess what Gracie is all they have.Miss Congeniality is okay and it does make for a good laugh, however the plot is a bit silly and the testosterone level is very low, most of it coming from Sandra Bullock!"
4,A very pleasent surprize,I went into this movie with rather low expectations and it was very good...well written and acted...I like and recommend you buying it. I gave it 4 stars because I save the 5th one for movies that I think will be classics...I dont think this is the same a Blazing Saddles or Pink Panther for longevity but is a definite must see
3,Movie average; Bullock great!,"OK, it's nothing special as a movie; the word ""fluff"" says it all. Even the FBI is portrayed as fluff. The story is so hackneyed that ALL the roles are one-dimensional, but fortunately seasoned actors (Caine, Bergen, Shatner, etc.) milk some substance out of them.Sandra Bullock is wonderful in this film. I barely knew who she was, but by the end of the film I was a big fan. She makes it all worthwhile. She could have played the part opposite cardboard cutouts and made it worth watching. (Unfortunately the male lead is only slightly better than a cutout.) I just hope she can get ahold of a better script than this one for her next film."
1,Who approves this stuff?,"I rushed out to buy the DVD because I had heard it was a fairly amusing movie. Amusing? For whom? My eight year old? My five year old? It was inane and silly. I think Dr. Doolittle 2 rates slightly above this one and you don't want to know what I thought of that one. It makes you wonder what these guys in the studios were thinking when they spend thirty million dollars to make this movie! What a waste of money. Well, you can save YOUR money. You can have a better time watching traffic."
1,Missed Comedy,This is easily one of Sandra Bullock's worst movies. Full of old jokes even to the point seeing the gracefull pagent entrant fall over not once but three times.I felt embarrased for Michael Caine who must gringe whenever he sees himself in this movie.How could a very average looking entrant who used that old joke about the ideal date win the pagent anyway.For a comedy this movie is a big joke on the public who paid to see it.
1,Complete Rubbish,"Never in my life have I felt so sorry for a talented actor as I did for Michael Caine. What a waste of a great acting talent. This movie was so dull and predictable it doesn't even warrant 1 star. Sandra Bullock's laugh sounded like a rip off of Suzanne Summer's pig laugh on Three's Company. The script for this movie was unimaginative and dreadful (much like a Pauly Shore movie) If you are a fan of good comedy, avoid this film at all costs."
2,A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS...,"First, where did Sandra Bullock's career go? The swirling has stopped, I think with this one she's already well down into the septic tank. Did she do something while I wasn't watching to really deserve this?She seems like a nice enough lady (if not Miss Congeniality).Second, Name one thing about this movie that merits a sequel. I sure can't find anything--and I'm one of the people stupid enough to have seen the first one.Feel free answer these questions for me. It'll be time better spent than the time you wasted on the movie itself.I guarantee it."
4,Only Sandra could have done it!,"We have had a lot of suspense/thriller films in the past & it is a breather to have a funny (slapstick as it may be) version of the FBI & its latest case. The plot is shallow, I agree, & there's really nothing to ponder about. But I have to give Sandra a thumbs up sign for this. I cannot think of another female ""star"" who could have carried the movie lightly but successfully."
3,"nice try, but just doesn't get it","Slapstick humor, an unconvincing premise, and a shallow script combine to make this a disappointment, despite a few funny scenes. Bullock (Gracie) has no on-screen chemistry with her leading man, and in fact, all the males in this superficial romp come across as mindless dupes, including (surprisingly) William Shatner, who did himself a disservice appearing in this flop. Michael Caine ditto, who appears as the stereotype gay beauty-consultant who works miracles with the incorrigible ""Gracie"". 3-stars may be high, but it did have a few chuckles, and it tried hard."
5,a GREAT movie!!,"I love this movie. I've watched it 2 times (soon to be 3, hopefully) and I know that I'm going to have to break down and buy it. It's the first movie I've ever seen with Sandra Bullock in it, and she's now one of my favorite actresses. A definite must-see."
5,One of Sandra's better Films,"After a string of dramatic, deep, and comedy-lacking films, Sandra Bullock makes an excellent comeback in ""Miss Congeniality"". The film depics Gracie Hart, a nerdy FBI agent who goes under cover under the allias Gracie Lou Freebush as she stakes out the annual Miss United States Pageant as the beauty contestant from New Jersey. The film features an all star cast including Micheal Caine, who palys Gracie's pageant consultant, Candice Bergen, who plays the pageant director along with William Shatner, and Benjamin Bratt, Gracie's Boss and her secret ""Object of affection"". The cast, combined with the witty premise, and Sandra Bullock's brilliant Acting and Producing ability, makes Miss Congeniality one of the best films Sandra Bullock has ever pulled off.So, No matter what your tastes may be, (and I quote from the films jacket), "".....MISS hits."""
3,Feminist Fluff,"Fitfully funny romp that suffers from slack direction, sloppy script, and transparent female lead. Sharper editing might have made up for director's lack of comic timing, but there is no finesse for Sandra Bullock's ham-fisted attempt at comedy. It's one of those feel-good-about-everyone movies that first offends and then takes it all back in predictably lumpy finale. Should have been a lot funnier than it is, and compares badly with similarly themed Legally Blonde, a feminist movie with real charm and wit. For genuinely amusing and incisive look at beauty pageant industry, check out Michael Ritchie's 1975 film: Smile."
3,Simple minded froth,Maybe I expected too much from the movie. It turned out to be pretty simple minded and didn't seem to be able to make up its mind whether it wanted to be a thriller or a comedy on beauty pageants. Not the least bit scary once you found out the gorgeous Candace Bergen was the villain. Save your time and watch L. A. Confidential again if you are in the mood for a good story.
3,NOT THAT GOOD!!,"I am dumbfounded to see sandra bullock's Performance in this movie. It was kind of funny, but I expected better from her. Sandra Bullock starred in many excellent movies like 28 days,practical magic and hope floats which made her famous. I didn't really like this movie, but it still wasn't that good. But if you liked things like drop dead gorgeous and bring it on or coyotte ugly, then you might think that this movie is kind of cool."
3,amuzing,"this was funny but, it just wasnt that good i mean it wasnt bad, but it was sooo predictable. And if you think abut it the plot is really stupid"
3,Miss Congeniality,"An interesting, if implausible, plot. The story is followable, which is often not true of contemporary films. The plot is well timed."
5,Miss Congeniality,"This movie is the best Sandra Bullock flick to date. It's the kind of movie that makes you want to get up, find a stylist, loose those inhabitions, ignore your credit card bill, buy that dress you can't afford, and nab yourself a Mr. Bratt!! If you're in the mood for the best movie to ever come out of the 'makeover' genre, you've found it in Miss Congeniality. Now if only I could hire Micheal Caine to transform me, but that's another dream altogether!!!"
4,Turn off your brain and let yourself be entertained.,"This film has a really horrible reputation, but it's actually not that bad. Once you turn off your brain and stop thinking about the story, it's actually quite good entertainment.If you hate Sandra Bullock, this film will probably do nothing to change your mind, but I watched it with very low expectations, and got a really positive surprise.Oh, and the scene with the talent show, at which she's wearing a tyrolean style dress and making the glasses sing - it's just worth the entire movie. I laughed so much I thought I might never stop."
1,Surprisingly bad,"I love My Fair Lady type shows and thought the premise and cast of this sounded great. But I barely made it through the end of this movie. Only a few of the jokes were actually funny. Bullock's love interest only had a few moments when he wasn't being a jerk, and there was no reason to understand why she was attracted to him. Her turnaround in attitude about pageants, as expressed in the stage interview scene, must have been explained in the outtakes some of the other reviews mentioned -- 'cause in the movie it comes completely out of the blue. Worst of all, the whole theme of the movie is that the pageant contestants are fine the way _they_ are, but Hart can't be a complete woman and no one will like her until she douses herself in cosmetics. Granted her manners needed improving, but beyond that -- the message in this movie was amazingly heavy-handed, and NOT one I want to hear."
3,Stupid but Funny Flick,"I thought this was a decent light-hearted flick, but it did get a little stupid sometimes. I do feel that Sandra Bullock needs to get away from these types of films and start doing some serious work (she was almost there with 28 days, but then this came out)..."
4,Very Funny and Smart Comedy,"Perhaps not marketed the best, which led to it being overlooked in theatres, Miss Congeniality is nevertheless a smart, funny comedy and perfect vehicle for Sandra Bullock. Who cares is she lies about her age - she is beautiful, charming and extremely funny in this role, Wiliam Shatner, Candace Bergen and Michael Cain are terrific as well - the movie is light but not forgettable - i almost never listen to commentaries on DVD but i watched the movie and commentary back to back and enjoyed both. Give this one a chance and let Sandra win you over!"
5,Great Movie,This movie was hilarious ! I watched it over and over. Sandra was funny trying to act like a girly girl. Everybody should see this.
2,Replete with agendas...,"When I first saw it in the theaters, years ago, I actually liked it. But today it just grates on me as it has all of today's immoralities shoved in my face. The language is also a bit extreme for the context of the storyline. This film and its sequel definitely earns five rotten tomatoes. Not worth the expense."
5,Love it,"my daugter was looking for this movie in store she love it ,and i love it knowing that you can purcahse something from here so easy"
1,Miss Congeniality,The packaging was damaged. This was a gift and I had to remove the CD's out of the original packaging to gift wrap. The CD's were not damaged.
3,Most hilarious and glamorous Sandra Bullock movie I've seen,"Wow! MISS CONGENIALITY, in my opinion, is the most hilarious and glamorous Sandra Bullock movie I've seen. I saw it with my ex-boyfriend, and he laughed at it A LOT. Even though I didn't laugh that much, I still enjoyed it as much as he did. I thought Gracie (Sandra Bullock) looked VERY pretty in the dressy clothing she wore. Also, I was surprised to see that Ernie Hudson from THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE was in this. One of my most favorite quotes of MISS CONGENIALITY is, ""F.B.I. You might wanna stay out of this."" That was SO HILARIOUS! To all you Sandra Bullock fans who have not seen MISS CONGENIALITY, I HIGHLY recommend it! You're in for a good time and a LOT of laughs, so, go out to the theater and see it today. You'll be glad you did."
3,not that great,"I love Sandra Bullock, but this wasn't one of her best movies. It was entertaining, but too predictable. Could have been better."
3,"Sanda Bullock, ugly?","Getting past the impossibility of making Sandra Bullock look ugly is a tall chore, but it's a fun movie. `Sorta reminds me of Cher in Moonstruck. She was gorgeous even when she was ""plain""."
4,Great Fun,Sandra Bullock is hilarious in this entertaining movie. The rest of the cast is great and this movie will surely make you laugh.
5,Just Love this gal! Sandra Bullock is just wonderful in every part she plays!,This gal could do a movie standing on her head and I'd love it. She is one of my favorites. She is a gifted actor. She is funny and plays the comedian and yet can take being humiliated like water off a duck! She can be serious and tug at your heart. She is talented enough to meet it all. I have just about movie she performs in. She's a trip...literally!
2,"DIGESTIBLE FARE AT BEST, BULLOCK IS A POORMANS JULIA","Miss Congeniality is PREDICTABLE. The relationship between Sandra Bullock and Benjamin Bratt is not believable, the acting is fair at best.The only thing that saves this movie is Candice Bergen as the TV Queen Host of the Miss United States pageant, and Michael Caine as Bullocks Make-up diva, other than that this movie is a bust.Sandra Bullock has proved she is the poorman version of Julia Roberts, and with each movie she keeps getting worse and worse.This should of been a TV movie of the week."
2,Warning: Guys stay away,"Women, don't torture your men. Rent it on girls night. It had a few funny moments, but the torture far outweighed the humor. The story was... not worth comenting on. Wait for it to come on cable (it won't be long). That way, you have the option of switching channels without having wasted money. I gave it two stars for the wardrobe - Sandra does look rather HOT in some of the costumes..."
1,Seen it all before,"What a horrible movie. Ive seen all the jokes, snorts, and falls a million times. I couldn't wait for it to end and had a hard time finishing it. I am usually a sucker for a funny movie and love all the great ones but this one failed to live up to an even slightly funny movie. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time."
5,A Congeniality Reality,"I loved this movie...although it probablly would not be that entertaining if you could not relate. I would love to have a job like Sandra Bullock's character does in ""Miss Congeniality"", an exciting, and uncommon one. I am very clumsy though, quite like Gracie, and I would probablly ending up having an adventure quite like hers. I think it is very cool that she saves the pageant and gets a real life. I would recommend this to anyone who would be able to relate, or enjoys Sandra Bullock movies."
3,Good for those lazy afternoons with nothing to do,"I think that this was the wrong film for Sandra Bullock. It had it's moments, but on the whole her film ""While You Were Sleeping"" was much funnier. Bullock tried to carry off the role of a tough, just one of the boys FBI agent, while at the same time learning to be feminine. This is not her fault, the writers simply didn't provide her with the material to work with."
4,Good but not great............,"After three years of trying to find a simple stereo with aux inputs so I can tie in my Ipod and Sirius radio, I think I have finally found one. I tried many others with their Ipod and aux interfaces and they were terrible, either slow, awkward, on simply didn't work as stated. This has an aux input on the front and one on the back which you need to buy a $25 adapter to use. You also need to buy a $30 Ipod adapter and you can only use one or the other, not both. How stupid is that, but I am finding unfathomable stupidity in design is normal for car stereos. Bottom line, its cheap, it works, you can use the aux inputs or IPod link for your accessories, it sounds ok, nice remote, the SD card is cool and actually works as stated, just load it with mp3s. Controls seem more user friendly than most. Radio pulls in well, better than my Clarion attempts. Its good but not perfect. Perfect would have been the ability to use both aux inputs and the IPod interface at the same time."
1,unbelievably crap quality,"I bought this set really only for the 10mm socket. It did not fit the transmission bolts I needed to remove, since it was manufactured incorrectly. The splines of the triple square profile were not uniformly ground. I looked at the other sizes and saw similar problems on them. Clearly, the slave child in China who made this tool did not get proper nourishment that day/week.Amazon return process was trouble-free, but GearWrench quality control is non-existent. Stay away from any tool with GearWrench name."
1,Gear wrench 80572 review,This product didn't work at all. I only bought it for the second largest 12 point and it wasn't even the right size. It was too large to work. Horrible experience. Make sure you purchase another 12 point set if you need it to work. The long black straight bits from Lisle worked great.
5,Thule escape a great product,"We took this bag crosss country (4000 miles) and lived to my expectations. We encountered snow storms, 14 plus continuous hours of pouring rain and the results were excellent. I had two North Face base camp duffles inside and everything was pretty dry (some minor dampness occured due to the extreme weather encountered). The pros definitely outweighed the cons and I highly recommend this product."
4,car top carrier,"I was pleased with the car top carrier, except for one thing. I had left the carrier on overnight & it rained. The water pooled in the middle & soaked through. We just took it off & left it to dry, but now I know that you cannot leave it on, if it rains. I did drive through some very heavy rains & the inside stayed dry, so it is OK while loaded, just not empty."
3,"Leaks in water, but overall ok.","I bought this product for a 6-7 hour trip to VT. And although it claims there is max water resistance, read here that they mean that it is not remotely waterproof. We hit a long-lasting rainstorm, and of course found water in the bag. Puddles of water and everything else was damp. What really surprised me was the same thing happened after a rainstorm when the car was NOT moving. Puddles of water and everything was damp again (of course the night and day that we left VT!)If you live somewhere that is really dry, this is the bag for you - otherwise I'd avoid this product.I'm really disappointed with it and will be saying the same to the manufacturer."
1,coating is flaking Thule 866 II,"I bought this because of the Thule name and the good reviews. I went on a week trip in November and when I returned home and was unloading I noticed the coating is flaking off on the top. Not just in stress areas, but several places on top. I did not abuse this item. It appeared fine when I got it. I will continue to use it, but it is not as water resistant as it should be. If waterproofing is important I would go for a hard shell."
5,Bob,"I am this many. I like Bob. My mommy is writing this for me. I like Bob. I'm going to marry Bob. Bob, Bob, Bob. Bob for President. This book really expanded my mind to open up new areas of interest."
5,Must Have for Homeschooling,"The other reviews listed here are accurate and not overindulgent in their praise of this series of books. We used the Bob Books for late Kindergarten and, now, in First Grade to re-inforce learning to read via phonics. The books are not intimidating to an early reader. They are fun, simple, progressive and build a lot of confidence in a hesitant reader. The drawings are sometimes hilarious and can be colored if your child is so inclined. I really love Bob Books and so does our son. They were the gateway to literacy for him and now he's confidently working his way through other early readers. You must buy these books!"
2,"VG Book, but get the 5th edition instead.",This is a very good book for beginning collectors of M1 Carbines. It is very well laid out with lots of information. BUT There are later and better editions now in print. (The newer editions have more information and important updates for collectors) Pass on this one.
4,Exciting,"I have Bryden Thomson's recordings of With the Wild Geese and In Ireland, which I prefer. O Duinn's tempos in both works are a bit faster than Thomson's, building up some excitement but also losing some of the lyrical flow of both pieces. Also, the sound engineering on Thomson's album is better, although the Naxos sound certainly is very good. This is my first encounter with the Irish Symphony. It's interesting to note that Amy Beach also wrote a Celtic Symphony around the same time, which was based on native material as well. The Irish Symphony, however, is the better of the two works. It has sparkle, especially in the second movement, and a wonderfully evocative and atmoshperic approach to the material. O Duinn's performance seems to me to be very good. His orchestra plays well, although I would really like to hear Bryden Thomson's version, too. Collectors wishing to experience Harty's music at Naxos's price need not hesitate."
4,Great Irish flavored symphony,"This is a pleasant, enjoyable collection of Harty's best work. The highlight is ""An Irish Symphony"", where various Irish tunes are interwoven into the music. I immediately was swept away into visions of the countryside of Ireland while listening to this disc, and was impressed at the ability of the music to create such a strong visual picture in my mind. Harty based most of these pieces on themes and stories from Irish history. Strong violin pieces throughout, and a definite Irish flavor. A nice listen for days when you want to escape the busy, hectic, work related stress. I was a little disappointed by the recording itself (it's fair), though for the price, Naxos continues to be a leader in the field. Thus, for such a low price, definitely buy this one if you enjoy classical music!"
2,bosnia dvd,was not what I expected. I was looking for a Docum. on the reasons behind the war and lack of USA involvement.
5,One of the best movies ever made.,"Not only does this cover historical context but also the cyclical nature of life and the various effects of cultural changes that dramatically change the environment we live and function in. The film manages to address self-discovery, revolution, the fact that things do not truly ever change as well as the incredibly damaging effect of some people's motives and ensuing actions on our environment, both physically and mentally. It does all this without forcing situations and uses the natural pace of the story line to accentuate the points it wishes to express. Truly amazing and despite its length one feels like it came and went like an hour and a half film. Once the film grips you it has the ability to change lives."
3,A Bit of Siberia,"Generally, this is a lumbering history of some Siberian families through the years to present times and the loss of the tundra. It is very long and cannot be presented in one sitting."
5,"exquisite, catchy","A breathtaking story written with humor, love and class. It keeps you alert and interested all over the four hours of action. Successfully blends private stories into a more general context. A Russian and more sensitive Forest Gump."
4,DH Mossie,"Excellent book for the Mossie fancier, even better for the scale modeller. Fantastic view of various stages of construction, great number of revealing photos, and beyond that a good read."
4,solid and useful outfeed table,"I recently installed this outfeed table - I believe quality outfeed tables essential when dimensioning sheetgoods. I have a one person shop - without the help of another person or a outfeed table like this one, there is elevated injusry risk.This product, sold by Grizzley seems to made by htc and often carries a higher price.One feature that is particularily nice is the ability to lower the table so that cross-cut sleds riding in yout t-slots to clear the table when executing wide cross-cuts.Installation instructions are fine though I found leveling the table with my table saw top challenging.Very good product at a good price!"
5,As close to fresh made as you'll get!!,"This is fresh tasting and has all the ingredients you'd want....the lemongrass and galangal are GREAT in the can...they only add to the flavor and are easy to pick out, and there's not too much that it's annoying or too filling in the broth content.I can't agree with another reviewers input on it being too spicy....unless you're just not used to Thai or Asian chiles in cooking, or are not used to hot spices. I actually added fresh hot chiles because I like it hot!As it is, this is a great base! I added some chicken breast and a bit of chicken stock, fresh mushrooms, fresh cilantro, some fresh chopped red serranos, squirt of lime juice and some bean sprouts and you've got a meal! If you're camping or in a rush, the soup alone from the can is wonderful as well.Let me repeat that....what comes in the can is perfectly WONDERFUL and you don't need to add anything if you don't want too.SOOO happy this is available!!"
1,Terrible soup,"The vegtables have the taste and consistancy of twigs and the broth has a weird gross after taste. I'm sticking to Annie's, Their Thi soup is excellent."
4,Missing one star for video quality,"Other than the occassional lackluster video quality and transfer (which is not digitally remastered) this DVD is a welcome addition to the home libraries for anyone who grew up watching classic early 90s cartoons. I would include in that list SWAT Kats, Tale Spin, Darkwing Duck, Gargoyles, and others...The storyline is stellar and takes its time developing the characters and settings. The war fought between the humans and Neo-sapiens is not black and white, and makes you think, something few cartoons do. Rather, this should be classified as an animated series, ala Batman: The Animated Series and Gargoyles (seasons 1 and 2 anyway)."
3,Better than average series and good seller (movietronix),"Better than average series with mech warriors fighting human creations, 'Neosapiens'. Alot of voice actors from ""Conan the Adventurer"", as well. There are no real extras to speak of. Also, I need to include here that movietronix sent the product on time and in new condition since Amazon took my ability to leave seller feedback a day too early. So, positive feedback for them."
4,Geo2000,Exosquad I feel was one of the best shows on TV at the time. Makes me feel very nostalgic for the good old days.
5,Great Show,Recieved DVD quickly and in great shape. Great show. Can't wait for the 2nd season to come out.
5,Excellent,"This show is so much better than GI Joe or any of the mecha shows around the same time... and the toys were possibly the coolest that existed in the 90's. Now, I'm just waiting for seasons 2 and 3 to come out on DVD... and also how about Pete and Pete Season 3 and the Wonder Years tv series?"
5,Nothing better,"This is simply as good as it gets for American produced ""space opera"" animation. Not the drawing, but the characters, story, storyline development, depth of characters, plot changes and revealed secrets. This is simply, as good as it gets."
5,Great Item!,Received item quickly! Just as described! This was one of my children's favorites growing up and they just had to have these episodes again so they could enjoy their childhood memories!Thanks! A+++
2,A 2 Simple Model of IT Management,The idea from the book is great; approach a complex subject as simple as possible. Unfortunately I have missed theory and practical examples to prove and explain the matter. The author stays too superficial and needs more persuasion to convince the reader that the subject can indeed be approached in a simple way. Finally I would have preferred some real life situations instead of movie quotes.
4,Acceptable,"Price fair, not exceptionalID info should have included dimentions. Original part slightly larger, as a result, this replacement battery rattles around in phone compartment."
4,"It works, but...","The battery was compatible with my phone, but it was significantly smaller than the batter I was replacing. As a result, I needed to stuff the battery compartment full of padding to keep the battery from rattling inside the phone."
5,An amazing glimpse into Community Based Doula work,"If you think doulas are only for ""rich"" women, think again! This story shows the inspirational work of one amazing, committed doula who serves teen moms on Chicago's West Side. The real, down-to earth ways she provides emotional and physical support and information to each young woman, as well as their families and community as a whole, is a great model for anyone trying to work in community or to work with pregnant women. It could also be a great way to show pregnant teens examples of how empowering natural childbirth can be."
2,Okay but lacking some substance,"Chris is open but he tries unsuccessfully to convince the reader that he was humbled and knocked off his high horse during a session with Stella the horse. Seems to me that he wants to believe he has become altruistic and has written a book to try and convince himself.To his credit he has come a long way in life and conquered many demons. But, many irrelevant photos and self praise show that his ego is huge, and insecurities large.Sadly, I suspect this book was an insincere effort to try and save face in the business arena. It is highly likely that Chris will have another greater fall and the resultant book will reach sincerity."
3,Interesting & insightful,"I loved some of the insights and it's worth reading. However, I thought the Author could have been more focused on the overall picture and less focused on himself toward some of the later chapters."
3,Misnomer,I thought that whilst this book was quite fascinating it didn't really address the issues that the book began with namely an incident where a good horse trainer loses his cool with a recalcitrant horse and in front of an audience. He gets angry and actually uses his crop on the horse.For me it left a lot of questions which start to get discussed in the final chapters of the book but almost as an afterthought.If the book had been about how we deal with our darker feelings then it would have more satisfying and more reflect the title. A good read nontheless.
1,This book is not about friesians,"I was looking for a book on training Friesian horses. When I did a word search on Amazon, this book came up. This book is NOT about training Friesians. The Dark Horse in this book is not actually a horse at all--its the traumas, short-short comings, flaws and insecurities that Chris had to overcome in order to be the horse person he is today. While I found the book fascinating, it is not really not about horses, it's about training yourself. Be prepared!"
2,Looked used even though I order new,I ordered a new book but it was definitely used. The front cover page was bent and torn while the packaging remained in tack. The binding of the book is barely holding the pages in.
3,Good ideas and insights,"Interesting ideas linked with inisghts into Chris Irwins personal life, trials & tribulations. Very readable."
3,Dancing with your Dark Horse,"I was disappointed when I received this book to find that it had highlights inside that I was not aware of. Also there were the remnants of an old sticker on the front cover. I understand that it was used, but would not have bought it from this person if I knew about the highlights."
2,can't play it,"but I bought if because it was the first Tetris I ever had, and maybe can figure out a way to make it work,. Nostalgia in the electronic age!."
1,Keys Fitness Push-Up Bars,"Poorly constructed. The wing nuts do not line up to secure the bottom tubes, making the Push-Up-Bars wobbly. Find an alternative!"
4,fun movie for your family,"Stuart has became a full member of the Little family. Stuart goes with George (Jonathan Lipnicki) to the school with his human brother and plays soccer. Only, once outside of the family, Stuart still finds no friends. Lady bird Margalo bursts into his life, and they quickly become friends. Still, apparently Margalo is not as happy with the new friendship as is Stuart. This is how the movie starts.""Stuart Little 2"" succeeds where many sequelae fail: it presents a perfectly independent story. The problems from the first movie are forgotten.Now Stuart has new problems. In search of true friendship, he entangles himself into a turbulent adventure. The human characters Geena Davis and children, including Jonathan Lipnicki, move simultaneously into the background. Sparkling animation and exciting action again delight, as tom-cat Snowball with his witty brisk sayings angles for best supporting character.A fun movie for the whole family."
2,Not close to as good as the first,"I had low hopes for the first Stuart Little, and I thought it was a good movie. Then when I heard of a sequel I had high hopes for it but I was very dissapointed. I thought the story of the movie was an idea that was not thought about very much. There is a little action in this movie but most of the action in this movie people have already seen from the previews and trailers on TV. When this movie comes out I recomend keeping it away from your Rental Queue. Do not waste money to see it in the theatre, do not rent it when it comes out either. I was entirely below what I expected."
3,Celluloid Life's Little Miracle,"Although tried and tested children's movie formulae don't excite me, Stuart Little 2 is enjoyable because of the inventiveness infused to bring little Stuart Little to human life. I always appreciate details in a cartoon, and thus love the careful minuitiae that make Stuart so cool -- his furniture, his clothes and his mannerisms certainly steal the show from child star Jonathan Lipnicki.Nathan Lane is always a riot -- if I had to think of him as an animal, it would most definitely be grumpy Persian Snowbell. The adults are nice stand-ins for parents accompanying their brethren in viewing this movie."
5,Little is Back And Bigger Than Ever,Stuart Little 2 is a great movie my whole family loves this movie. this is a great movie for adults and kids. Great Movie
5,Stuart Little 2,"We rent Disney World homes, Stuart Little DVD is a favorite for the wee ones. Excellent condition, and came in a timely fashion. Love buying from Amazon.com we have been very pleased with our products."
5,Cute and Affordable,Affordable and a very cute movie. If you like Stuart Little....getting all three movies is a must. Great family movies.
2,Sort of like Toy Story on Qualudes,"I can put up with the ages old wisdom of scaring the crap out of kids about the big scary world and the nasty people who live in it, and so what if the falcon is the bad guy and the rodent is the good guy so long as there are no BB guns under the tree, but lets have some fun! This is a kids movie. Stuart is sort of likeable and Snowball the cat has some good lines, but I only watch this sort of thing because I am sure I will feel good at the end and I ended up thinking this movie would make kids not want to go outside. Happy I watched it first.Stuart little is a poor stepchild in a genre filled with excellent heartwarming films.(Aladdin, Lion King, Toy Story, Finding Nemo)."
5,as good as advertised,just used the new blade to install some base and crown molding over the weekend. perfect cuts every time on MDF and pine.
3,Warm Comfort,"As a rubber/latex rash sufferer, I was delighted to find these latex-free Warmbat slippers. They're snug, but wool tends to flatten and slough off over time (my wool slippers from Germany lost all of its inner wool). So expect the snug slippers to loosen up. I am glad that I ordered these latex-free slippers. I don't have to worry about a rash!"
5,scottish fantasy: pure heifetz,i purchased this cd with the intent of hearing this piece of music played by a virtuoso and i was not disappointed. heifitz is at his best and the scottish fantasy came to life. it is a wonderful interpretation and superbly played.
4,Fun for the kids,"This isn't very realistic, but it could definitely trick some people. One of the problems with this, though, is that if you have other (real) ice in the glass, the fake ice is colored and shaped differently. That can give it away pretty fast.But with my kids, that doesn't matter so much. They have no poker face. When they come to me in any attempt to trick me, they are incredibly obvious. It is all about the idea of the trick that is most of the fun for them.This is a fun product. But maybe not for adults, unless you are trying to trick someone very gullible."
4,Bugs,"I bought this for a Thanksgiving day joke for my grand kids to play on their parents. Every year, they get a real kick out of it as long as everyone is playing along. Not good for use in small children. It's so small and smooth like real ice, a small child could swallow it."
1,bad bug,"I was very disappointed with this item, ice cubes float, this one doesn't. My guest never noticed the bug at the bottom of her glass, underneath the other ice cubes.Bar Bug Ice Cube"
3,Communication Problems,"From the beginning there were problems with communications. Amazon allows shipping to a PO Box but the subcontractor does not. Took a couple of calls to resolve where to get it sent to. Told them to send with my husband's name at his work and they didn't. This almost caused the items to be returned to sender; but the receiving person took extra care to call me not knowing that my husband (different last name - told to sender)worked there. If he had done like most receiving people, it would have been returned to sender. Thank goodness for people who can think at the receiving end because the sending end did not.The product is excellent and we have used it for over twenty years. We think more people will like the product but the service was the poorest I have seen. Amazon has always done an excellent job and most subcontractors have been equally as good as Amazon. We have done hundreds of purchases through Amazon and will continue to use their services."
2,Loaded with Stereotypes,"This book had its moments, but it's certainly not to be taken seriously as phrasebook. Chockful of American stereotypes of Japan, most of the phrases, while actually Japanese, I can't imagine actually being used in real situations.Well, maybe the phrases to use if you're a female being groped on a train (""Arrest this pervert!"")."
3,A Movie That Should've Been Called 'What White Women Want',"Yes, as my title states, this movie should've been called What 'White' Women Want. I think the movie is ok. Mel reminds me of my dad...being so overprotective."
4,Enchanting,"This collection is possibly one of the best I've read in awhile, and I'm hard to please. Take that into consideration for holiday shopping."
2,Not much to offer,"This was not a great year for salsa hits... as is reflected in this compilation. There is no comparison to Salsa En La Calle Ocho '98, '99 , 2000, 2001, or Millennium Edition. Except for the Frankie Negron cut, everything else is so so. Beter to invest in a more solid, albeit older collection, like Latin:the essential album; or get groovin' with the new Putumayo release, Latin Grooves."
4,A scream of rage from Jewison and Pacino,"The Bottom Line:One of the most anguished-seeming films in all of cinema, ...And Justice for Al wears its heart on its sleeve and paints an absolutely damning portrait of American jurisprudence; it sometimes feels like a connection of vignettes with several extraneous sequences and without a central plot, but its a movie you won't soon forget.3.5/4"
4,Aspect Ratio,"Regarding the aspect ratio of this DVD, there are some copies that have both widescreen and full screen on a 2-sided disc. Other copies have only the cropped full-screen (pan & scan) version. There is no indication whatsoever on the cover which version you are getting. Only a careful reading of the back cover will clue you off. I mention this as a ""caveat emptor"" for widescreen fans, such as myself. If you really do want the 1.85:1 widescreen version you might be better off purchasing this in a store where you can examine the specs on the back cover."
3,Pacino is perfect.,"This movie is one of many of my favorite Al Pacino films. As always Pacino's presence is captivating and you can't take your eyes off of him. I love the way the film can be funny one moment and dramatic the next because thats how life is. Change is a gaurentee no matter how many plans you make. I thought Pacino's work with his co-stars ( Lahti, Warden, Forsythe and Strasberg ) was terrific and the performances with the rest of the actors who played Pacino's friends and fellow attorneys was excellent, and of course the actors who played Pacino's clients. The scenes with Pacino and the homosexual criminal and the young man falsely arrested are just so real and affective. Everytime I watch this movie I feel good but more importantly 'I feel.' And as always most times than not when you watch a movie with Al Pacino in it your going to get more than you expected whether you like that or not, and I like that alot."
3,Al Pacinio is GOD!,"The movie over all was good. Nothing I would want to see again. But Al Pacino's part is amazing. His character is strong and crazy. (Something that is perfect for Pacino.) I would recamend this movie, just for Al pacino's preformance. NOt really for the story line."
2,And Justice for Al,"This film is trying to make a statement about the American Judicial system. As far as political satires goes it is weak. Al Pacino plays a lawyer who loves being a lawyer until he witnesses a series of injustices that makes him question the law and the ethics of it. Then he is asked to defend a man he knows is guilty and he struggles with what to do. Yawn, Yawn, Yawn. This movie starts out interesting but fizzles. Pacino gives his usual inspired performance(he received an Oscar nomination), but this time in an uninspired film. He is reduced to being a witness of a bad film he cannot save."
3,ranting raving shouting but sensitive al,"has any actor besides al pacino made such a fine career for himself by screaming? the logical absurdities of the movie weaken it as the film tries to tread the line twixt sidney lumet and robert altman, but hey, pacino IS fun, and the movie introduced jeffrey tambor and christine lahti and craig t nelson to mass audiences. fun, but nothing great."
2,it didn't really work for me,"i really do like Al Pacino, and this film has great satire on our country's leagal system, but i found the movie to be rather slow. the script almost seemed incohesive at times: at one moment, he is telling a woman of his frustration with the legal system, then he is taking a dangerous helicopter ride with a judge and then he is defending a drag queen who had last been seen at the very beginning of the movie. i also enjoy watching Jack Warden act, but his character in this movie did not seem real or natural at all.the DVD doesn't have too many whistles or bells, but there is a director commentary, so that scores some points.i did not enjoy this movie, but if you are a diehard Pacino fanatic and want to see everything he has done, go ahead and watch it."
1,Buyer Beware,"Contrary to the ""Format"" information in the ""Product Details"" section, this DVD (""...And Justice For All"") DOES NOT include a letterbox or widescreen (1.85:1) presentation. Only the pan & scan (1.33:1) presentation is included. I know this because I purchased the item based on this information, only to find this out upon inspection and playing of the DVD."
2,A fairy tale depiction of the legal system,"Anyone connected with or even remotely familiar with the legal system in this country can tell you scenes like the ones depicted in this film just don't happen. There's a decent acting performance by Pacino, but it's not one of his better ones. The entire screenplay is just a bogus fantasy, the worst one made since the Three Stooges short ""Disorder In The Court""."
1,Ugh,"I thought this movie was horrific. It was just...dumb, Pacino kept representing clients that just killing themselves and the ending was one of the worst I have ever seen. bad bad movie"
5,great,Pacino is the best. this is when hw is great actor. however not the most realistic. if you like Pacino get it
5,Classic Pacino Academy Award Performence.,A classic and as far as I am concerned the truth about the legal system. I could watch this over and over again
5,"Should be seen with ""The Hospital""","A great movie,as the lead review indicates. If you liked it,view The Hospital(George C.Scott) which gives a similar view of what can happen in hospitals."
4,good movie; is FULLSCREEN 1.33:1,The Amazon description says the aspect ratio is 1.85:1.It is actually 1.33:1 (fullscreen).
5,"it, al !!!","this film is one of al pacino,s best work.up to tis film i never thought al pacino can be so funny!! this film prove i was wrong!!!"
4,Pacino shines in courtroom satire,"Ever since watching the Godfather films I've been a huge Al Pacino fan. His amazing over-the-top performance in the courtroom scene at the end is what makes this unsympathetic look at our criminal justice system so memorable. However, I agree with other reviewers that the plot is slow at times & the movie wavers uncomfortably between comedy & drama. The humor is at times a little too forced & the disco music doesn't help. One of the things I really enjoyed was seeing the great Lee Strasberg play Pacino's grandfather. Remember Godfather Part 2 when Pacino had Strasberg ""taken out""? I only wish they could've made more films together. The great cast also includes John Forsythe (who plays a TOTALLY unlikable villian), & Jack Warden, whose suicidal antics get annoying after a while. Of course, it's Pacino that makes this movie so entertaining & so watchable 25 years later. While it's no masterpiece I still highly recommend it to Al Pacino fans (& especially lawyers!)."
3,"Mediocre quality dishes,","Seeing that these dishes are made by Corelle I was hoping for superior quality. I ordered two sets for Mothers day, once I got them I opened them and found that two dishes had noticeable blemishes on the herb design and a few others were a tad bit crooked around the rim when looked at all stacked together from a profile angle. There is also noticeable crookedness on some of the green trim on a few of the dishes. At a quick glance you can't really tell though. The return service with Amazon is great, I sent them a request for an exchange and they sent me another set right away, unfortunately when I opened the package I found a broken plate. I sent back the blemished plates along with the broken plate and had no problems with Amazon."
2,I bought a brick,"I had read a review for another Cowon product and thought that the A2 would be a better purchase. After purchasing I read that firmware upgrades were difficult. That is true. I downloaded the upgrades but have not been able to move them to the A2. I also found their music source has a limited selection (don't expect to download Bob Dylan music, for example). I am sorry that I let my daughter take my Sony product to college."
2,major power problem!!,"This machine is great and convenient when it is ON. Mine had a power problem from the time I got it. I thought I could fix it with some firmware updates and stuff, but I couldn't. When I found out from online that it wasn't just me having this issue, I decided to return it. Other than power problem, I really loved it. If I find a machine that works the same as this and doesn't have any power problem, I would definitely buy it."
4,"Raises my ""cool"" factor, use it all the time","Great item, only would be nice if it had password protection and wifi/bluetooth"
5,good pmp,"+ plays most video and audio (inc. FLAC) formats+ nice display+ long battery life+ fast hard disk+ very nice interface+ frequent firmware updates with new functions+ very good user support, inc. unoficial sites- too big for a shirt socket- comes without a remote- reads id3 tags but arranges the files only by names, directories or playlists- joystick (time will show how much will it last)- no real time volume normalizing (some players have it)summary:real nice PMP. very happy with this product. meets most expectations.-"
3,A2 Has Some Significant Music-Playback Deficiencies,"I have found my Cowan A2 to be an excellent portable video device, but I'm disappointed with some significant deficiencies it has when it comes to playing music. First, the A2 does not recognize playlists in the .M3U or .PLS format (or any other)-- the playlist functionality is limited to creating an ""on the go"" playlist on the device, which cannot be saved after a power off. Second, the A2 ""reads"" ID3 tags, but does not allow the user to browse music on the device based on the tags-- e.g., you cannot search or play songs based on ""artist"" or ""genre"" etc. Music on the device is organized strictly on a folder-tree system.I recommend the Cowan A2 if you are primarily looking for a video device. However, if music-playback functionality is an equally important factor for you in choosing a media player, the Cowan A2's lack of these key features probably makes it the wrong choice."
4,Cowon Rocks!!!,"This is a Master piece. Though it has been in the market for 2 years it really lived upto the current trend. I would definitely recommend this over the 30GB Ipod. Coz of its flexibility and easy transfer system they have. The music quality is definitely better. Not to mention about their 4"" display. Good companion for anyone who travels everyday on a train or bus.Cons: A little bulky and so inconvinient to slip into ones pocket. But if you are carrying a backpack then hat shouldnt be an issue too."
1,more headache then it worth,"Could not use it, arrived defective from vendor.Spent almost a month before Amazon finaly ussued refund but still no word from vendor/manufacturer"
1,Purchase from Beach or Amazon,"It seems that Jet Audio may have spammed the jet audio reviews with ""quick delivery"" items. I've been waiting 2+ weeks for the Cowon A2 after ordering from Jet. And getting through to customer service...grab a snickers...UPDATE: Dec 14, 2006Well, we did finally receive the Unit about 3 weeks later than expected...but at least it did arrive!As for the A2. It's a gem. Bright, crisp screen and powerful sound output when played through car stereo. The other reviewers have summed things up well (multi file format support is so nice). The A2 is highly recommended..."
5,this is what I expected,"This product is really what I expected it to be. It has a very clear display with a high resolution for a 4 inch screen. The stereo sound is really good. And it has a long lasting battery. Buttons are easy to use. I tried recording from the television, and it is also satisfying. I had no problem about any divx or xvid video type. I really enjoy watching films with cowon a2."
4,Great player,"I've had this unit almost 3 weeks - it's a great player. It's very easy and quick to move music from my home computer to the player. I hook the unit up to my office stereo, and my car stereo via the auxiliary input. The FLAC file playing capability was a must, and works flawlessly. I didn't even realize when I bought the player that I could record high quality AVIs from an external DVD player, or a digital video camera. And the ability to make MP3 recordings directly thru the built-in mike is very handy.However, there are a few things that could be better. Although battery life is advertised at 16-18 hours - in use it's more like 10-12hrs. Also, there's no way to save playlists on the Cowon that I can find. If you change the playlist, the old playlist is gone. And I'm already wishing the Cowon had more than 30 GB of storage space."
2,reddoggie,This is a wonderful media player with loads of features. The problemI have had is that it breaks after just a couple weeks of use. I havehad this model replaced three times and my thrid one broke the firstday I used it.Cowon A2 30 GB Portable Multimedia Player
1,Dissatisfied,The unit is good looking and the LCD screen large clear and bright. I bought this unit to record videos w/camera attached. The toggle button used to navigate switches between icons easily but when you try and select one it jumps to another. The same way it does when selecting folders. When in record mode it fades out to a gray screen and turns to snow. Several times when powering up the top of the screen would appear in the middle of the display and the top part would be fuzzy. The most fustrating aspect was the customer service or lack of. There is no working phone number to reach the company. You can however submit a service ticket which is low priority and work in progress. After 2 Months of no contact I finally gave up and returned the unit to Amazon which replaced it. The new unit had all of the same faults plus a few more. Returned to Amazon for refund. If you are just going to use it for photos it is great if yo can get past the fustrating navagation process.
5,It's My Favorite Toy!,"I really love having this portable media player. I first read many reviews about this PMP before making my purchase. The video playback is crisp and sharp. I especially like taking it to appointments where sitting and waiting is involved. The software easily converts the different movie files. I had to upgrade the system and by following the instructions at the Cowon website, I was ready to upload stuff in 10 minutes.I did buy the remote control and it's not that useful. My only complaint is when I want to stop movie/radio or music I have to switch to another icon and make another selection.Overall, I do love having this gadget. Some people ask me if I can make phone calls with it...I wish. Wireless remote and wireless headset would be great. I might add that with the remote you can skip to the next song or movie. I had my Cowon since November and have not experienced any malfunctions."
1,Not what I expected...,"I must admit I was surprised when I received this cover. The package for this is about 1"" thick and it weighs about a pound. The vinyl is extremely thin and actually tore as I was putting it on. The vinyl is very cheap and you can practically see right through it. I previously had a similar cover and it was thick, lined, padded, etc. This is a single thin sheet of vinyl like a cheap outdoor tablecloth."
4,a caveat,"pls note that this compilation covers only the first 4 albums. there are no songs from albums like ""the notorious ..."", ""sweetheart of ..."", ""Dr. Byrd ..."" and the ""ballad of easy rider"". just a warning for those who might be looking for a complete collection."
4,The Byrds Greatest Hits,"I enjoyed listening to the CD, it took me back to my youth. Not a CD that I would play a lot, but when I need a trip down memeory lane, it is a good choice."
2,Why?,"Because there's about as much need for a Byrds greatest hits as there is for a Beatles greatest hits. You buy the regular albums, dummy. I haven't bought a dull Byrds album yet-they are all full works, no filler. I mean, I can understand this was a quickie attempt to capitalize on a phenomenon in 1967, why get some incomplete, unencompassing best of record of a perenially brilliant band? The only nice thing abou this particular GH is that they included extra tracks on the CD, and Younger than Yesterday's ""Have You Seen Her Face"" is smartly included as a noteworthy Byrds tune. There is a two part Byrds singles album out there on Columbia somewhere- if you must purchase a ""hits"" record, you should look into that instead."
3,Connoisseur .,Lacked only one track not in my extensive inventory but it was required to complete my reproduced CDs containing a repertoire of great artists and the tracks of music preferred.
5,The Byrds Greatest Hits,"This is a great CD, especially for those of use who remember the bands best years spanning the late 60's to early 70's. Great music from the past, Roger McQuinn picking his 12 string, protest back-round on many of the songs. A ""must have"" for all us aging hippies."
4,The original jangly guitar sound,The Byrds are timeless. And Eight Miles High is one of the gems of psych pop. McGuinn is genius and this was a bargain. My old vinyl version was too beat up to salvage and I got yet another cheap replacement off Amazon.
5,Rock and Roll from the 60s and 70s is great,Haven't listened to the Byrds since my 8-Track died many years ago. Purchased the CD so I could download onto my IPod. Great memories of the songs of my former years. Highly recommend the greatest hits to any of the many Baby Boomers who still like to rock to the oldies.
5,One of the most original sounds in rock...,"McGuinn's 12-string guitar opening of ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" was the beginning of a new sound that would come to be known as folk-rock. Blending the lyrical content of Dylan, with the jangly 12-string guitar, and the harmonies of Crosby, McGuinn, and Clark, the Byrds were one of the most original sounds in rock music. This album has their greatest hits of the era, including the aforementioned ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" ""Turn, Turn, Turn,"" ""Eight Miles High,"" and ""I'll Feel A Whole Lot Better."" It also includes the outstanding bonus track ""It Won't Be Wrong,"" with one of the most unusual chord changes of that era. Numerous bands would follow in their wake, immitating their folk-rock attack (R.E.M., Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Gin Blossoms), but no one quite sounds as fresh as they do."
3,Not the best showcase for SACD,"You can't argue with the music here - it's classic early Byrds, with the band's original line up and with many of their best covers of Dylan material. None of the LPs from ""Sweetheart of the Rodeo"" on, alas, is represented. The sound is a little fuller than the last Columbia Legacy version of the CD, but the mix is pretty muddy - intentionally so in most cases. Anyone expecting the sound to take of and fly may be a tad disappointed with this Byrds set. Let's hope it's not a harbinger of what most of the Columbia tapes from that era will sound like in the SACD format."
2,too small,this unit is great for very small itemsbutfor larger ones it clogs or you must just put less in itwish i had realized the size before i bought it
4,"Good, lock of information","The product is good but it needs to give all pertaining information.Your are buying blind and can' t see the product, need tip size voltage range etc."
4,Easier said than done,"I thought this book had great ideas and it really inspired me to try them with my child. However when it came to actually making the cards required (bit of intelligence cards) I am finding difficulty aquiring the appropriate pictures to use and as such I cannot get started. I realise this is not the fault of the authors and would still reccomend purchase of this book, just be prepared to use a little ingenuity in seeking out the required materials. I believe the princilpes in this book to be sound and that they would definelty help any child to aquire more general knowledge."
2,Hymn Fake Book,"I was disappointed in the selection included in the book. There were a number of ""good ones,"" but the book contained mostly nondescript works."
3,Comprehensive though poorly harmonised,"This Hymn Book is a fairly comprehensive edition and covers hymns and songs from different denominations. It is mostly composed of old/traditional hymns. The negative point I found on it is in regards the arrangements that don't work very well in the guitar and don't look very good on the piano either (I play just a little bit of piano so I cannot tell that for sure). I was able to re-harmonize and re-arrange most of the hymns so if you have a good theoretical background or can do arrangements by yourself it can be a good guide for you to start. But I don't think it is a good book to rely on completely for your playing. Also, if you're only interested in the melody lines and lyrics it is again a very comprehensive book and you'll probably be able to find the hymn you're looking for on it."
4,Remember - What C Edition Means,"Good, useful reference. If you don't know many of the hymns here, you may want to look them up in a traditional hymn book to learn the arrangement details; they're worth learning.""C Edition"" means it's written for instruments that are in the key of C. It does not mean that all the songs are written in the key of C. Some instruments have their music written based on a different key. Alto and Baritone Saxophone are Eb instruments. Tenor and Soprano Saxophone are Bb instruments, and Clarinets are usually Bb instruments too. Trumpet and Cornet can be in B flat or C. English horn and French horn parts are usually written in F. Alto flute is in G. So any of those instruments would have to transpose this music to read and play it properly. But guitarists, pianists, and singers will find the C Edition to be just fine for their needs."
3,Hymn Fake Book,"Lots of great songs, only problem is the plastic binding makes it impossible to turn the pages w/o jamming the pages where they connect to the binding. I took the binding off, punched notebook holes in the pages and put in a binder I bought at WM. Also has very small print!"
2,Disappointing to an Evangelical,"As a leader of my church's worship band - and able to take just so many content-less praise choruses in a Sunday service - I was excited to learn about a book with guitar chords for 1000 hymns. I thought, this is just what I've been looking for to be able to add some good 'truth' to the great 'spirit' that the band was bring to Sunday AM worship. However, I must say that I was dissapointed when I got a look at the book. I've grown up in evangelical churches and this collection is not aimed at this background. I have been singing hymns for over thirty years now, (and probably have the words of more than one verse for over 300 memorized) but I can turn page after page after page in this collection and not recognize a one. My feeing is that probably only a fifth of the hymns with which I am most familiar are in this collection. I'm not sure where these hymns come from, but they're just *not* what's found in the mainstream evangelical hymnals I grew up with."
2,Good While it Lasted,"Like another reviewer mentioned, this product is great until it breaks. I was running it on Win 7 for about two weeks and suddenly it just stopped functioning. I understand the company has folded and support is seemingly nonexistent. I would spend a little extra and go with a product that is well supported. I'm very disappointed in this machine."
1,Get a manually operated system instead,"We had this for about half a year. It repeatedly would quit working and I would have to unplug it and reboot the computer about weekly. Then a message started appearing about a fatal error unable to retrieve file about every other day. There was NO support available for this. Finally at the end of its life, it completely quit working and we had to tear apart the case - this is NOT easy. There were disc casualties and injured hands involved.Now we have a Discgear manual retriever - it is very easy to organize and you do not have to worry about the computer file going bad, or having discs stuck where you cannot retrieve them."
3,Be aware....,"Be aware that this product seeems to be ""orphanware."" That is, if you email the manufacturer you will get nothing but an automated reply saying that they will be getting back to you. They don't. One hopes that's not typical of Aussie customer service.I have two of the units. One has worked fine, one has trouble after loading about 80 disks. Even after deleting everything and reloading there is still the same trouble.But even after all that, I'm still considering getting another one.It's amazing the price differential on the 'net - I've seen as high as $99, and as low as $35. It pays to shop around."
1,not worth your time or money,I bought this a few years ago and had problems with it from the first. Discs would get stuck so it wouldn't turn. It was contantly haveing to be rebooted...it would just suddenly not appear in the computer. Finally when it stopped working all together - after only 1 year - it was pure hell getting the discs back out of the thing.I have now bought a Discgear case that is manually operated and I LOVE it!
3,Software does not support Snow Leopard,"I've had one of these units for about a year and used it with good success. Overall it has been worth the about $50 cost.Unfortunately, after upgrading to OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) I found the unit to be virtually unusable. I contacted the manufacturer and was told that Snow Leopard is not yet supported and not given any suggestion as to when it might be - ""check back with us on the forum"". I am continuing to use the device with great difficulty and I guess I will have to use it from Windows in a virtual machine on my iMac. I am considering purchasing a unit from a different vendor as I've discovered that there is 3rd party software available for it and OS X.This information was given to me in late November, 2009."
4,I have 3,"I have three of these. No, it wasn't hard to figure out how to use these. I'm looking at buying a fourth one. They aren't slow, and noisy? Come on, the device is turning for your selection- big deal! The only complaint is the price. I advise printing out a selection of your movies, and label each one DVD/CD1 (or 2,3)."
4,Cost Effective Storage,"I received two of these units as a gift. Purchased NEW at an a very reasonable price. Less than $40,00 USD each. The software isn't the greatest but is very functional. I have had the 2 units for more than a year without any major trouble.I think they are well worth the price however if I purchased them at some of the higher prices I've seen on the internet I would be disappointed with it's performance."
3,Really Old Design,"Although I finally got this device to work with my Mac Mini after an extensive search on the Internet for software, I only have very basic functionality. The free software supports only Mac OS 8 and 9, but I don't think the expanded version that you pay money for works any better. The software works okay for checking in and checking out discs, but when it tries to analyze a disc to see what's on it, the program just hangs."
3,Interesting,I was looking for a more nuts and bolts facts about raccoons. Too much story telling and not enough study about the raccoons behavior for my needs.
5,The Greatest,"I'm a huge Fan of Fantasy novels and such, I read The Forbidden Game awhile back, and I still like to read it now. It is one of the greatest trilogy of books I have read since i picked up Lord of the Rings the first time. It's a series of books that you never tire of reading, and everyone should read them."
5,"""He CaN sHaDoW Me iF He WaNtS""","I have to say, this is one of the best books I've read so far...L.J. Smith is a great writer and this is one of the best examples of her talent. This wonderful trilogy is both scary and romantic-a definite must-read for all who love danger and romance. You'll definitely fall in love with Julian, the nicest of the Shadow Men, straight from beginning to end. Sweet but tragic ending(hopefully Ms. Smith will realize the mistake she made with it and write a 4th book with Julian's return =).)"
5,""" Good ovr. Evil""","This story attracted me to it at the age of 9 yrs. old, especially since of my love of vampire stories and such which comes from feminine figures drawn towards a dark power and other types of evil. I liked it because the girl ""Jenny Thornton"" was able to overcome ""Julian's"" grasp on her. She was able to overcome the evil thrown against her even though at times he seemed unbearable. Even though Julian loved her and tried almost everything to have her...still Jenny was able to succeed by the power of good. This story definitely stated the power of good over evil. In a way, she stood as an example for me: a symbol for all those, especially feminine, to stand up for ourselves in times of unspeakable evil and the ""bad"" in our lives. I hoped this review proved useful."
5,"Haunting, mesmerizing, absolutely beautiful!","I loved Julian!! I keep wondering what if the ending had turned out differently. It's beautiful, a story about a demon man who falls in love with a human, not exactly original, but always a good plot. How sad that he can have everything he would ever want, except human love. Tom is so boring compared to Julian, but then the ending couldn't turn out any other way. If it had turned out the way I wanted it to, I doubt I would like it half as much as I do."
2,Very lightweight vis-a vis the title,"Apart from the history which was interesting, the contents covered the other topics in a very cursory fashion. The book was long on emotion as to ""how marvellous your wonderful new puppy is"" but gave little practical information on what a new owner wants to know as far as puppy care is concerned(first night at home, house training etc) which were glossed over in a couple of sentences. Far more space (and lavish photos) taken on showing the dog and flossying it up - a lot of owners just want an everyday pet, not a prima donna."
2,Overly focused on showing/competitions,"This book is great if you're looking to figure out whether your shih tzu is showable and can participate in competitions. Other than that, there are far more helpful books out there in terms of puppy care, how to work with and train a shih tzu, etc. I didn't learn anything from this book since I don't intend to show my dog. There isn't anything else in this book that is unique or particularly well done. If you do want to show your furry friend... this might be for you"
3,A Good Place to Start,"""The Guide to Owning a Shih Tzu"" is a good book for initial information regarding the Shih Tzu. It gives brief information on the Shih Tzu's history, standard, grooming, feeding, training and health. The pictures are charming... as are most Shih Tzu. This is a good place to start if you are looking for a book to introduce you to this breed."
5,Blue Guitar by Chris Rea,"What a fine piece of music work done by Chris Rea! I was lucky enough to find this great collection of blues in Amazon.com, and for a marvelous price. I love all of the new songs Chris Rea introduces in this magnificent collection."
1,The package was completely crushed,The CD had to be extracted from the demolished package and CD Jewel case. I haven't had time to return.
4,Mile Stone Album,"So much of the Slack Key Guitar history and technique is credited to Gabby Pahinui, that I felt this was a must have album. I do not relate to some of the selections, but the arrangments were made decads ago. The transition from these selections to the work of his son make the music more enjoyable for me. I am still happy to have the album in my collection."
2,Informative but lacks focus on Western Europe,"Over the years Let's Go Europe has attempted to add more countries to their Europe guide, at the expense of detail about more traditional destinations. In the 1998 edition, there is so much information on Russia, The Baltics, Poland, Bosnia (yep!) and the East Mediterranean that Western Europe is left with only half the book, and not enough detail. Since relatively few travellers venture into these areas, I question their decision to include them in a Europe book. I ended up buying their UK, France, & Germany books to provide enough detail to plan my trip. I'll still take Let's Go Europe with me, since it's a valuable resource, but I wish they had left Eastern Europe to its own book."
5,The BEST Europe book,"I'm using the book now to travel around Europe and I just love every word. It's really funny, and it brings you all the best places to stay and eat and see, everywhere you go. I've been from Amsterdam to Athens with this book, and I just keep thinking...how do they keep it so comprehensive? They even sent me to this Internet Cafe! That's right, they have complete and accurate listings of internet cafes in every major city. It's just totally the thing you need. Well, I'm going to stop writing now and catch a bite to eat in a Let's Go restaurant that is supposed to be really good. I believe it... every other place they've sent me to has been awesome."
2,Not worth the extra weight in the pack.,"I just finish travelling through Europe for three weeks. On the road the book was absolutely useless. Any and every place that they recommend such as youth hostels and restaurants were completely booked and filled just about entirely with Americans. The book gives very little detail and information on the historical and important sites that litter every city in the book. We ended up using other books we had brought and tourist information booths located in just about every train station. To get information such as complete listing of youth hostels, maps, and what to see and do in the city. You are better off picking up separate guides for every country/city that you visit. That way you can know something about what you are looking at and can appreciate it. I recommend using it as place to start your planning for your trip and then leave it at home."
2,An Unoriginal Tour of Europe,"If you are looking for an adventure in Europe, I would suggest you look elsewhere- I would suggest Rick Steves or the Lonely Planet. However, if you are interested in staying at the same places and going to the same attractions as every other American college student backpacking through Europe, this is the book for you."
4,"lets say, its ok,","last summer I went to Europe with my friends and we used Lets Go Europe, but 98, and it was fine, but it misses a lot of information, it should warn the travelers, specially the backpackers about the things that can happen there. For example, in Prague, some friends rented an apartment, and the next day, after paying about 250 bucks, a lot of guys came and kicked them out. Well, it sucked, but these books whould warn you about those things. Great bar, pubs and clubs reviews, if you go to Barcelona, go to Maremagnum"
5,buzzzzzz saw,This blade does a much better job than I ever expected. The cuts are as smooth as glass and the blade is real quiet. This is the only saw blade I'll ever buy from now on.
5,Excellent blade,"I used it to make a lot of cuts on a cork floor (we installed it at a 45 degree angle). With my old (cheap) blade, I needed to tape the spot I was going to cut to protect the finish. Not with this blade. Precise, sharp cuts, with no damage on the edges."
5,great product,I bought this blade based on the review. It works as expected. I am using it on cutting the wood stub. Each cut is very smooth and easy.
5,Cleanest blade for finishing work I have ever used,"Used this blade for cutting sheets of Cherry wood paneling. The seems were perfect. 11 pieces fit together like a perfect jigsaw puzzle.I would recommend this blade for anyone using a miter saw, bench or radial arm."
5,works just fine,this works just fine for cutting the wood I needed to build my porch. it has also stayed pretty sharp.
4,Decent 80 tooth blade,"This 80 tooth blade for a mid price piece seems to be doing a pretty good job of making 'slick' cuts, much better then the 50 and 60 tooth versions I have on other saws. I haven't used it a lot yet as it is a miter saw blade and haven't needed it often lately. I would rate it higher, but the other two are mediocre so don't yet have a good feel for this one's longevity. I'll try to update this later"
2,More of a list than an anthology,"The authors and texts chosen for inclusion here are good, but the excerpts are too short and/or poorly edited to give you an idea of what's really going on in the source texts. The editors have managed to squeeze the life out of some very exciting material by trying to cover too many authors in not enough space. Better to xerox the table of contents and find the source texts on your own."
4,Okay,The book wasn't so bad it was a little worn out and some pages were bent at the end overall it was readable and a good price.
2,Quality Not What I expected,"The only good part of this purchase was the efficiency in receiving the product. Apart from that the write regarding the product and condition was quite contrary to the actual product I received. The book was dogged-earred, underlined, marked up and it was apparent that the book had gotten wet and was air-dried given the yellowing and crumpled look of the said wet pages."
2,Dissapointed in this one,"I bought this blade for my 14"" saw. They original blade that came with the saw lasted well over 1000 cuts. this one lasted about 200 cuts and quit cutting. Freud did warranty it and sent me a new blade. I keep it as a back up blade. I wouldnt reccomend it. Definitly not the quality of their wood products."
1,Oh please,"I'm 12, and even I can tell this is about as goth as 50 Cent. Ooo, so dark and spooky....if you can call Britney Spears in leather pants spooky. Try And Also The Trees, Children On Stun, or Andi Sex Gang. Those are REAL goth bands. Or for some great dark poppy stuff, there's Strawberry Switchblade. Don't be fooled by what the media says...this scag is in no way, shape or form 'goth'. 'Background filler for pseudo-alternative clubs' is more like it. Feh."
1,"Not gothic, barely music.","If you're looking for a good new goth band, you might want to look elsewhere. This is run-of-the-mill pop trying to disguise itself behind an ""edgy"" fashion statement and some ""please pay attention to me!"" trying too hard lyrics. If I could give this zero stars, I would. Don't waste your time."
5,"This book changed my life! (In Math class, anyway.)","I read about half of this book when I was 12 years old, and didn't learn anything new in math until I was 15. For the next few years, I watched fellow students struggle through math class without ever understanding what they were doing. For me, that was Asimov's brilliance--his ability to explain the how and why of math. While classmates struggled with rules and methods learned by rote, I understood what was happening in the equations. This should be required reading for students everywhere--although that might result in lay-offs of math teachers."
5,Best introduction to algebra ever!,This book is the best introduction to algebra you could possibly find. It is even a good book for those who've already learned algebra and want a quick review of the principles.
5,Incredibly clear and lucid,Concur with all previous reviewers; why wasn't this required reading when I learned (or was supposed to have learned!) algebra in school! Outstanding little book possessing far more wisdom and information than its small (paperback) size would seem to indicate. A real collectors piece!
1,Too much scientific jargon for the average person,This book explores hearing and memory from a highly technological view point. It is difficult for the average person even with a college degree to follow and renders one bored after only a few pages of trying to follow the tiny details in the book.
2,I love Aussie products. I especially enjoy the ...,I love Aussie products. I especially enjoy the fragrances. I Test Drove the Aussie Moist and was able to use the product for only about three days. I have a terrible reaction to the shampoo that made my scalp itch something awful!
4,I liked this shampoo very much. First of ...,"I liked this shampoo very much. First of all, the bottle is huge and it has a handy pump on it. Secondly, it has a very nice clean smell to it -- not feminine or flowery like a lot of other shampoos. It made my hair feel soft and manageable and squeaky-clean. I'd recommend this to others as well as purchase this product in the future."
4,I immediately liked the smell of this shampoo. ...,I immediately liked the smell of this shampoo. It doesn't overpower. I have very thick curly hair and noticed results after my first use. My hair feels lighter and seems softer as well. I would definitely recommend this product and will purchase it in the future.
5,I really enjoyed the Aussie Everyday Shampoo. I ...,"I really enjoyed the Aussie Everyday Shampoo. I have naturally curly hair, and I tend to have a hard time finding shampoo that works well with my hair type. This shampoo was great! It didn't dry out my hair, which is usually what happens with most shampoos. My hair was shiny and soft. My hair feels cleaner and less tangled. Another big advantage is the packaging. The pump makes it easy to use in the shower. I will definitely recommend this to all of my friends and family."
1,take this back to Austraila,"This shampoo may make's a woman hair slinder, thin, shinny, and smooth. And also getting the naps out of your head it also makes your head smell like's old senior citizens folks."
2,When Living Was a Labor Camp (Camino Del Sol),The front cover and first half of the pages in the book were torn on the side
5,Tune catching,"I really enjoyed this CD, it is very catchy. When you first listen to the tunes on the CD, it sounds like any other; but as you listen to it more and more it turns out to be very catchy. You easily memorize the words to the songs and the rythm is not tiring or boring, there is a great variety of music on the CD. Needless to say again, I thought it was a wonderful CD."
5,harks back to early 90s dance club scene in west Africa,"This album is very simple and true to nature for smooth west African salsa rhythms, and harks back to the region's dance club scene in the early 90s. Always a great party favourite, and now brings us some nostalgia. His 2nd album ""Adia"" is also good, and his 3rd, ""Seva"" even better still. However, ""Bane"" is Oliver N'Goma's signature production. The song ""Icole"" particularly transports you off to one of his home dance parties."
3,An interesting series...,"I'm still having trouble with Skye Denison, the main character of this small-town series. While I enjoy the author's use of locale and her knowledge of psychology, I find the character of Skye very unlikable. She has a need to help people; she wants to be seen as independent; she feels compelled to get to the bottom of things. Yes, I think it's all about Skye's feelings, not the people she hurts, alienates, and leaves fumbling in her wake. She lies. A lot. Cute, pert, trying to be funny little white lies. She lies to justify her meddlesome nature. I may never like Skye, but the mysteries are engaging enough to keep me reading. I just wish the main character had a little more integrity to go along with her mystery-solving acumen."
4,murder of a sleeping beauty,murder of a sleeping beauty..i wish they were free though...as there are so many..i like the series love and kisses
5,love this series,they are a little short as a read for me- i can finish one in an evening but i just love the series highly recommend! i also love for us Trixie Beldon readers- Trixie Frayne. wink Thanks Denise Swanson!
5,Fantastic,I love Dr. Brown's. Dr. B's bottles really help my baby from getting gas or spitting up. My newborn was still having a little trouble with bottles using the level 1 nipples due to the milk coming out too quickly. I switched to the preemie nipples and haven't had a single problem since.
5,less choking!,Our daughter struggled when born with the level 1 nipples as they were too fast for her when trying to swallow. She would often choke and often we could hear the formula going in her stomache rather fast. We found the preemie nipples through Dr. Browns and ordered them and have has a lot of success! I would recommend these to anyone experiencing the level ones being too fast at first.
5,A must have for working breastfeeding moms!,"I am returning to work soon and needed to get my 3 week old used to a bottle. I tried lots of newborn nipples and it seemed like with all of them atleast half of the milk that I pumped was on her face and clothes. I read other reviews of these nipples, the flow is a lot slower that the baby would have to suck to get the milk out. I am so glad I got these! They keep feeding her not messy at all and she goes from bottle to breast with no problem at all!"
3,Alternative,Plano Reel Storage CaseI love my Riedel glasses and enjoying good wines. I'm sure this is a fine product but I carry my glasses in this Plano case for fishing reels and it works great. With the fifty bucks you save you can buy some pretty good wine.
5,Increase the value of your fine wine glasses,"We love our wine stemware, it enhances the taste and nose on great wine. This case holds 4 glasses of Riedel Vinum XL glasses. We bought two so my wife and I can take our glasses to resturaunts, and carry them when we travel. Very well padded, no incidents of glass breakage"
2,You would think a Riedel glass case would fit four Ridel wine glasses.,If you have large pinot Ridel glasses don't expect to put four of them into one of these or you will end up breaking your glasses. The case is nice and high quality - but they need to make it a bit wider to accomdate larger Pinot glasses.
3,"Tried-and-true bandaid, but made in China.","If you manage to slice a fingertip off, there are not many alternatives to stem the bleeding and protect the area that work as well as these do. Unfortunately, the batch that I got is made in China (leaves me to question the sterility and general quality - we'll see how they do). At least some of these used to be made in Brazil. So minus 2 stars. Harsh - maybe, but when a ""household"" brand goes the way of the lowest bidder, leaves you to wonder what is the point of buying a ""premium"" product. At least some of the 3M medical stuff is still made in Europe and the US."
1,Doesn't run when Nero is installed.,"I can't get this program to run with Nero installed, I just get an errorbox about a debugger. The game runs fine when Nero is uninstalled, but after re-installing Nero it refuses again.Tried this on various computers (XP Pro and Home, English and Norwegian version, Nero OEM and Full) but got the same results everywhere. Customer support doesn't get further than advising to uninstall Nero.Don't buy this program if you need Nero."
2,Not the best Scooby Game,After playing some other Scooby games my daughter (8) and I decided to pick up this one. Unfortunately it was not as good as the previous one we played (Some Egypt location game). This one was more annoying than anything else. She finished it really quickly and basically put it away for good shortly after. The previous game has a high replay value - not so with this one. It might be fun for younger ones though...
5,I love this bag,"First, be aware, it's very large. For me, that's great, it'll hold all my stuff. A couple magazines, a book, my purse, my daily soda, and sometimes my lunch. I love it. Even without pockets, this bag suits my needs. It opens wide for easy access, and zips closed if need-be, and I think that despite its large size, it has a nice, clean appearance. I like that despite the soft material (great to protect bag contents and insulates keeping my drink cool longer) the bag totally holds its shape. This bag would be great for travel, that second bag that you cram all the things you don't put in your suitcase."
4,I love this bike!,"The Fitness Quest Excel 286 Bike arrived very quickly. It was very easy to assemble, although it was a little intimidating at first. I use it every day, and my only complaint is that it's a little noisy. I am 5 foot 1 and I am very happy with the size of this product as well.Definetly a great buy!"
4,Excellent product for the price,"I bought this bike in the year 2001. I have been using this bike regularly. I use this bike for 20 mins at least 4 days a week.It has kept me in shape and for the price what I had paid for it, I have no complaints except for it makes little squeeky noise. I have never seen any parts falling off as mentioned by others."
3,Good for under $100,"For $99, this is a great bike. The ride isn't as smooth as I would like (though it's not bad), the seat is a little uncomfortable and I'm pretty sure the computer system isn't accurate (the timer is fine), but...again- it was $99. I would recommend this exercise bike to beginners or someone who doesn't plan on using this product on a daily basis.If you're looking for something more from a bike, you're going to have to spend more. But if you're on a tight budget and need a low-impact workout, then this may be the product for you."
3,Not made for heavy use,"This bike was made for daily use. Probably someone who would use it a month and then quit exercising.The fan wheel bushings cannot be lubricated and they began to seize. These should be ball bearings, or there should be a way to oil the bushings. Removing the fan wheel is complicated by all the platic guards. I lubricated the bushings with grease and it is working now, but I expect that this will be a quarterly job."
1,wears out too soon,I bought this bike new and the resistence strap wore out within 3-4 monthes. I contacted their website-- fruitless-- and when I called the company they said the part was not in stock and would not be available for WEEKS. If you are serious about a long term exercise regimen this is not the bike for you.
1,Don't Buy This Bike,There is absolutely no way to increase the friction/resistance. It pedals easily all the time....no workout value. Save your money.
2,"An ok Bike, more cons than pros.","It's an ok exercise bike for the price.I don't go over 20mph because of the reviews I've read, and there have been several, on what happens to the bike over 20mph. It hasn't fallen apart on me yet. I use it for 15 - 20 minutes 3x a day.I'm short so the seat is too high and I have to 'tip toe' on the pedals. This I don't mind, but what I hate about the bike is that the seat is unbelievably uncomfortable, EXTREMELY uncomfortable and for this reason I wouldn't recommend it to anyone over 200lbs and under 5'6"".I take the time at least once a week to re-tighten the bolts all over the bike.If I had more or a budget to spend on a better bike, I would have.Look at all your options, eBay or a local sports store before committing to this bike because comfortwise, it sucks."
1,Terrible!!!,This product fell apart before it was even put together. The parts crumbled. It was even missing parts! I would never recommend this product to anyone!!!!
4,Awesome legal battle with one's conscionce,"I just watched this movie on TV, and I would definitely wanna see it again one day. Garcia is brilliant and shows strong character facettes in acting. The movie is about more than the legal ins and outs of corruption and partnership. It's about the fact that one has to stay a human being in life."
2,Perfect example of how the 1% rule and oppress the 99%,"Here is a movie in which a District Attorney runs on a platform of prosecuting all law breakers, excluding none. Spoiler Alert - He then colludes with a judge, a policeman and a defense attorney - all involved in the same case, to ignore the constitutional rights of a defendant lie about when a search warrant was signed. This film must be base on a true story. It does project the truth of how the injustice system in this country works - one set of laws, practices and results for the powerful and connected, another abysmal set of laws, practices and results for the poor, powerless and oppressed."
5,Great Price,"Have been using this product for a few years and this is the best price I've seen it. Really helps save on your moisturizer, as it helps it to ""glide"" on."
5,Love It.,"I love this serum, it absorbs well and defiantly helps with the appearance of ones skin. This can easily be worn under you day or night cream, it is not greasy. Reviva makes really great skin care products that are not tested on animals and don't contain animal ingredients."
3,It's OK,"I've been using this for 2 months. I don't notice much when I use this product. It accentuates the darkness under my eyes, so I stopped using it there. I also believe it was making me break out on my cheeks, so I stopped using it there too. It's moisturizing, so it's good for dry patches. I am in my early 30's and don't have wrinkles, so maybe it would work better for someone with different skin texture? I think the only benefit is the moisturizing properties, which I don't really need."
2,Reviva DMAE Review,I did not see any changes in my skin while using this product. I used it for 3 months. I was not expecting miracles. I'm 30 year old so I really do not have any wrinkles or sagging yet. I was expecting this product to at least make me look refreshed but it did nothing. I'll continue to use my Olay Regenerist products they are way better than this. I really wanted to find a more natural facial product but this is not it. I would not buy this product again
4,DMAE firming gel.,Reviva _ Dmae Firming Fluid goes on smoothly and is aborbed quickly into your skin. This product is light enough so you can add an additional SPF for added protection. Dmae Firming Fluid leaves your face smooth and soft. I like this product and will order it again.
2,Hoping for Better Results,I purchased this item because of Dr Phil's presentation about how DMAE helps with wrinkles etc. I used it for about a week and a half and found that it made my face brake-out! I do need to add that I have occasional brake-outs and have used benzyl peroxide products. So maybe this is something that does not mix with what I am using.It just didn't do that much for me. I have purchased the firming eye serum as well and I do like it better.I think the addition of the lipoic acid and vitamin c ester helps the product.
3,"Too short, too many skits...","What few songs there are on this cd, are awesome...just not enought to really be worth buying, sad, but true..."
3,Could've been better,"This new EP is kind of disappointing... Songs 1, 3, 7 and 10 are tight as hell, but I can't really get into the rest (although I'm a big EC fan).If you're looking for a good EC record, I suggest getting one of the EC Allstars CDs first (pt. 1 being my favorite)..."
2,Some Eyebrows Please,"I will equally raise a brow when a small-time clerk insures his life for $50,000 and subsequently dies ten days later, it doesn't need any genius to work out something suspicious is going on. So when Maddox, the top man in the insurance business, finds out the scores to be settled, he is determined to get to the bottom of it. And this means trouble for someone. In fact it means trouble for the beautiful, auburn-haired Meg Barlowe, a woman with an eye rising past."

In fact it means trouble for the beautiful, auburn-haired Meg Barlowe, a woman with an eye rising past. for chase, fortune is a woman and if you wish to master her, you must strike and beat her and not proceed more slowly and coldly but fast and strong."
4,"Good book, common sense advice","This looked like a good common sense parenting-type book. It is. Am not done reading it yet. My 7 yr old asked what I was reading. I told her ""I'm reading a book about 'how to be a better parent,' Now if I yell at her she'll say ""Mom, I think you need to read that book again.""Be careful what you wish for. :-)"
4,Moloka'i by Alan Brennert,"Moloka'i is an interesting tale of a time in the history of Hawaii with which I was not familiar. It contains much information along with an engaging tale of a leper and her life before and after the disease. My one complaint is that the ending was a little too tidy, a little too ""Hollywood"", but all in all it is a good read."
5,Great read,"I loved this book. Having family from the Islands, including Molokai, really helped me connect to this story. It is amazing how people with leprosy were treated in the 40's."
1,Great book - LOUSY EDITION,"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK.However, this e-book edition by Macmillan is foul. Computer codes in the middle of words, chopped off paragraphs, trailing with garbage symbols... Would you enjoy reading a page of text peppered with trash characters like &apos; or ""height=0em width=1em?Doesn't Macmillan have editors to proof-read the product? Or are they engaging in deliberate sabotage of the e-book market? All the while charging top dollar. This half-baked product is not worth $9.99 - it is not even worth 9 cents.Do yourself a favor - get a paper copy instead."
3,Book Club Choice,ok but I really didn't give a hoot about the book. Leprosy is a horrible disease and the people were treatedterrible but I just didn't feel any affinity for the characters.
5,Great story,A brave and careing girl. A heart warming story that makes you greatful for the enlightened times we live in now.
4,Moloka'i,"this was a book club selection and provoked thoughtful discussion. While sad in many ways, it was also educational concerning leprosy and Hawaii's entrance into the U.S."
4,Good read. Interesting history,This was an interesting picture of the way lepers were treated in the 19 and 20 century. The advent of antibiotics has changed the world and the lives of those who were previously separated from society. Brennert writes in a style that draws you into the story and you forget you are getting a history lesson as well.
2,Editor please,It seems that Bennert studied 20th century Hawaii and its history with Leporacy--as well as histroy of the Japanese in American internment camps. I do think he was compelled to write a book about the human rights violations in those situations.Unfortuately he needed a good editor to help him reduce the novel by about a third by tightening up the prose and improving his style. The editor would also need to encourage Bennert to give his characters life. The characters seemed very cardboard to me. Lots of them propped around the island to let us know the history--but not to make us feel like they are living beings. Very disappointing execution of an interesting subject.
5,6 stars is more appropriate,"This book is fantastic! I could not put it down! Through the pages of this book, you learn interesting details regarding leprosy, but you also learn about the will to survive and the power of love. It is beautiful through and through. I highly recommend it!"
5,Molokai,"This is one of the best books I have read in years. It touches on faith, family,fear and prejudices on many levels. Most of all, it's about a life journey of strength and love."
4,Moloka'i,"I liked this book and the historic background. I lived in Hawaii as a child while much of story of the leper colony was unfolding - back in the 1940's. At that time, they were only experimenting with treatments and possible cures for leprosy. The characters in the story seemed very real and authentically drawn. The intimate details of daily life among the members of the colony and among those whose chosen ministry was to care for them. That part was very interesting to me. The setting was reminiscent for me - the pali, the lava rocks, the spraying of the surf, the trees and other plants. Hawaii came back vividly for me.I got a little bogged down in the later third of the book. However, it was worth persevering. I liked the book."
3,Interesting,The subject matter is informative and certainly makes me sympathetic to a time and place. However the story itself is a it too contrived. Still worth the read.
4,Touching Education,"I have friends who annually go to Molokai to surf so I did know about the leper colony that once was there but beyond that, knew little else. With this book you get a LOT of interesting information delivered via a touching story that enables you to sympathize with the people who were sent to Molokai, their families and the type of people who worked and lived there. It is not the story alone that makes this book great because solely as a story it is a little wanting - but quite good. What makes it a terrific book is that the story is a tender vehicle for making the information personal. I am very glad I read it."
5,Moloka'i is wonderful,"This is one of the best written, character and place driven books I've read. I learned a lot as well. The connection with the characters was a highlight, and the sense of place brought me there."
5,Truly beautiful book!,I have not read a book this big in many years so when i first got the book i was worried i would take a long time to complete it. However after opening the book i could not put it down!! The book truly drew you into its pages and I could not put it down until it was finished!After reading it i booked a trip to Moloka'i!! My trip to the site of this book was very much enriched by having read this novel. On the tour of the Island i met several other fans of this novel who also had been inspired to travel to Molokai after finishing the book!!
5,"Just, WOW","Wow. I learned so much about leprosy and Hawaii and Japanese-Americans. I learned so much, period. And, at the same time, I was highly entertained and fell in love with some beautiful characters. I love when a novel can do that. This, combined with Neil White's In the Sanctuary of Outcasts gave me a window into an ancient world that still actually exists. Leprosy may not occur as often in America as it used to, but ostracized people come in all shapes and sizes, and we are just as guilty of the prejudices against them as we were back then, with leprosy."
4,a great read,Loved this book from start to finish. After reading it I am determnined to visit the ISland! Also provoked me to research leoprasy.
5,"Engaging, Excellent Historical Fiction","This story weaves together characters from real life based on the author's detailed research. Before reading it, I knew very little about the how people with leprosy were treated, and had no idea of the life that existed within their confinement.This is an excellent piece of historical fiction, told through the character of Rachel's eyes from childhood until the end of her life. The author explores many themes, including how life within confinement is, the sacrifices she was forced to make, faith, and how societies at large often make horrible mistakes when they come upon something they don't understand (i.e. the colony, Japanese interment).I also want to say that while there is much to be learned here, this book doesn't read like a history book. It is very engaging, right from the beginning, and is a book you won't want to put down."
3,Lacked emotion...,"I love historical fiction. And, while I enjoyed the history of Moloka'i and the learning about the lives of the lepers, I think the novel fell very short of creating an emotional attachment to any of the characters. Events and people come and go, and moments that should have been heart-breaking to the reader came and went without much thought. I found myself skimming to the end and feeling empty."
3,good read but a bit rough on the blending of historical info with the story line,"For the most part, I enjoyed this story. It was engrossing, an interesting and easy read, however some of the historical data was plugged in rather randomly. It reminded me of being a kid, writing a term paper that required certain info in order to get a good grade. Overall, I would recommend this book as it portrays, in vivid and (hopefully) realistic detail, a very difficult time in Hawaiian history."
4,Unbelievably sad yet a story of perseverance.,I cannot believe people were treated so poorly. Especially after information became available about this disease! This is a heart rending story of despair and ignorance and love and hope.
3,MOLOKA'I,"MOLOKA'I was a bookclub selection. In my opinion, Mr. Brennert tried too hard with this historic ""epic."" Through his main character's life we see her dealing with most every challenge and setback that ever was heaped upon the entire leprosy community. I was most happy that in the end she reunited with her sister, her daughter, and was able to live with some semblance of happiness and normalcy. Whew! I appreciate Mr. Brennert's lengthy research into the history of the lepers, and his creative efforts to bring that information to light through this saga. The writing is good; yet, all told, it was just too much information -- too long, too dark and too laborious."
2,"Won't ""pass it on""","Although there was a substantial amount of information in this book about leprosy and the treatment through the last century, the story, while compelling, was told in almost a ""magazine"" format. The author inserts his observations about a particular behavior rather than developing the characters well enough so as to allow the readers to inform himself and draw their own conclusions. Had the writing been less overtly sentimental and mushy, and the characters and events written more intelligently, this could have been a 4 star book. Despite that, after a slow opening, this highly predictable story does move along and it does inform; but, after reading it you feel like you've just had a very rich dessert. While you feel guilty for enjoying it you know it's not as nutritious as it should or could have been."
5,My Review :),I just wanted to say that I was really happy with my order! I got it in a timely fashion and the book came just as described as it was online (in good shape). Thanks!
5,Fascinating,This well written historical fiction gives the reader a window into life on Molokai when it existed as a Le4per colony.
4,BookClub,"A very interesting, and well-written, book. Learned a lot about the leper colonies - not all pleasant."
3,Could have been better....,"This started out as a fascinating account of Rachel's exile to Molokai but after a while it just bogged down. The author never really endeared me to any of the characters.....I cared about them but I didn't really care what happened to them as everything became so predictable.It is , however, a great journey into a place that not many ever even knew existed and I learned a lot about the history of both leprosy and Hawaii.It is worth reading but I would suggest just borrowing it from someone."
4,Moloka'i,"Excellent read. Very well written; even if I had never been to Hawaii, I could envision what it was like. Also very historically accurate and informative. Truly shows how the human spirit can persevere and even thrive in the most adverse circumstances. Wonderful characters."
5,Extremely emotional and uplifting,"""Molokai"" is a fabulous book to read on your way to Hawaii. It is based on some of the true history and beliefs of old Hawaii. I started reading it on my flight to Oahu and was caught up in the story and the main character immediately, sobbing at times. All the characters, including Father Damien, were so real and memorable. Wonderful book, worth every cent."
3,A Good Read WIth Some Serious Flaws,"Molok'ai was a good read - I think because the author has a smooth writing style that pulls you in. All in all, I would give Moloka'i a B-.The book was SO predictable! Within the first few pages, I had the plot-line nailed. And I have a problem with writers who do alot of ""name dropping"" - and Moloka'i is rife with public figures making cameos and interacting with Rachel, the main character.There were some holes. Catherine sorta disappeared and reappeared... and finally disappeared. And some characters came and went quickly just so the author could make a point (or drop more names) - which made the story-line choppy. It's like the author had picked up some historical tidbits in his research and tossed them into the story at will.All in all, I would give Moloka'i a B-."
4,Great expectation,Fast delivery and book condition was as stated. I am enjoying this book for a book club. I am satisfied with the experience and would purchase more books from seller.I read alot and found this an easy way to find my books at a reasonable price.
4,Riveting story,"Rachel is a true heroine in this amazing story. For lovers of all things Hawaiian, this is a must read."
1,Now this is truly puzzling,"How do you take what could be an engaging plot, a stunning setting, and then proceed to embitter your readers against both? Read this book to find out! I simply can't understand the high ratings for this book! The characters should have been sympathetic--spoiler alert!--they have leprosy. But I didn't care and I blame Alan Bennert for this. I think he took a great idea and then did not execute it well. The dialogue is flat, the prose is boring. All of these reviews of the book are more interesting than the actual book.On a positive note, you only need to read a few words per page toward the end to know what's going on. No attentive reading necessary!Will I read another book by him? No, and in fact out of principle I won't even watch ""LA Law"" anymore (he wrote screenplays for the show)."
1,Really Dreadful -- One of the Worst Reads Ever,"The story of Kalaupapa and the people condemned to live there -- some of whom still do live there -- is a truly shameful chapter in the history of Hawaii, the US, and modern society. But that does not elevate this book. The characters are one-dimensional, the narrative is plodding and unimaginative, and the writing is at best only serviceable. Knowing some of the history, one can predict with precision the next tragedy to befall our characters, like clockwork. It is truly unfortunate that the real victims and heroes of this time are represented by such a trite, juvenile story. A real disappointment."
1,Moloka'i,Book missing some first letters on a page especially on Chapter 1 seems to be missing a good deal of the page.
2,Molokai'i,This book did not live up to my expectations. It was an OK read but I would not recommend it to an avid reader.
1,Brennert's books,"Bennert's books are biased and a lot of c_ _ p. I read his book ""Honolulu"" and it is ridiculous. Never read another one of his books again!!"
2,Deja Vu,"All I have to say is Shark Dialouges by Kiana Davenport, This book was almost the same story save for the fact that the heroine doesnt turn into a shark. Grandma's name was also Pono. Now I know Pono, Lono, Leilani, Kimo and Lopaka are all commonly used Hawaiian names (theres at least two in my family) but some on now"
5,Moloka'i,If you love Hawaii this book is awesome. It really give a historic feel for old Hawaii and a great respect for it's people. It includes a lot of the hawaiian language and old mythical tales weaved into the story. I loved it.
4,Paradise revisited,"An inspiring story of a leper survivor at Molokai, and how this one person was able to find peace even while experiencing tremendous hardships. A story that weaves the Hawaiian culture and Christianity, as history unfolds in this tropical paradise."
5,Moloka'i - a story of tragedy and victory against all odds,"Moloka'i follows the life of a remarkable girl from early childhood to being an elderly grandmother and documents the struggles, shame, and victory over the disease of leprosy. We get a glimpse of Hawaii before development took over, and see how people reacted to a disease no one truly understood. This story will break your heart as well as make you laugh at the antics of young girls held away from the general public as they fight to keep their dignity and grow up with the desires of girls everywhere. It is a story of family, history, tradition, loss, victory, politics, and the evolution of medical science."
4,tough topic,"I am glad to have read this book, but it was an experience of learning about hard parts of history without much literary help."
4,Solid,"Moloka'i was a good read but perhaps a bit longer than need be. If you are to continue along the same subject, I found The Shark Dialogues more interesting. A little less historical and a bit more about lore and culture."
2,Molokai,Actually I would give it 2 1/2 stars. It was a sweet story but much too wordy for my taste. I liked it but probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
4,Engaging read...,although this story is fictitious it is based on real life events and real life people and to learn of it through a childs perspective was totally engrossing. Great read. Totally recommend this read...
3,"An okay read, but predictable and disappointing","Interesting because I learned a lot about Moloka'i and the leper colony and our history with this disease.Touching in parts where people were trying to protect themselves and their families from the shame and fear of the disease and families were being separated.Disappointing because the heroine is too perfect, the characters didn't matter to me, the writing in parts seems straight out of a juvenile romance magazine, and too many events seemed to be just crammed in because, oops, this is a historical novel, so better not leave anything out."
3,Compelling story,Mediocre writing but a compelling story. Characters are well-developed. Interesting period piece. I read it for a book club with an interesting discussion but no real debate possible.
3,"Good, not great.","Molokai is a work of historical fiction, and is informative about the scourge of leprosy in Hawaii in the late 1800's and early 1900's. It is well written, but not on a happy subject. It was a choice of my book club, not mine."
3,Moloka'i,"The book was an excellent history lesson - so sad to read how the U.S. Government over-threw a monarchy, and to learn how victims of Hansen's disease were isolated for an entire lifetime. The paperback book was received in excellent condition, by the way!"
3,Learned a lot about Leprosy,"This book was quite informative about a terrible time in American history when people infected with Hansen's Disease were forced into leper colonies. From a learning perspective it was a good read, but there was just something about the story that felt detached. I had a hard time feeling emotionally involved with the characters or even caring when they died. I am not sure why that is. But if you want to learn about leprosy during the 1800's and early 20th century, you will find this book interesting."
1,disappointed,I was disappointed in the moral liberty that the author took so much so that I stopped reading it in the middle of the book and threw the book away. I won't read another one by this author. A waste of money.
3,Kindle Experience,"I love the new kindle, and have been downloading books when I see one I would like to read. However, after selecting ""Moloka'i"" by Alan Brennert, I found when I tried to read the book, the book started at Chapter 1, and when I turned the page found the chapter started with Locations 47-56. After trying to read the book anyway, the paragraphs sometimes start with the first letter missing. This hasn't happened to me with any other book previous to this one.Device info: Software Version: Kindle2.5.3(490488060) Serial Number: B003B0A200930FE0"
1,A Waste of Time,"I don't understand how in the world this book reached publication. One of the worst books I have ever endured through to the bitter end. Boring, boring, boring, junior high level writing and poorly researched. At one point a character is buried 'with head to the east'; 100 pages later a character is buried 'with head to the north'. Almost insulting to Father Damien who worked and gave his life to the colony at Molokai. I will never read another book by this person (I hesitate to call him an Author.)"
2,I just stopped caring,"Once you catch grasp of the premise, this is a very predictable tale. Girl gets leprosy and is quarantined. Nuns take good care of her, but her friends all die. Everyone close to her dies; she outlives everyone. She runs away when she is ten, she is awkward as a teenager, she falls in love with a man without the disease when she is 20, is a guinea pig for a research lab, marries, has a child which she can't keep, shows signs of deformity, all the while the world progresses around her. Oh yeah, she gets to meet the Governor of Hawaii. Isn't that special.There is nothing special at all about the protagonist, except she has leprosy, and about 150 pages into the book, I just stopped caring. The author really could have brought us close to her, but instead, spun a dragged out tale through the years, which left me skimming the pages just to see what else would happen. You could skim this book in an hour and take away the same thing as one who read it word by word."
5,Couldn't Put It Down!!!,"What a treat! This novel is SUPERB! I finished it and wanted more...more about the history, more about the characters, more, more, more..."
4,"Review by Allen P. Bristow, author of ""A Medical Necessity,""","Brennert's tale of the plucky young woman who survives the horrors of Kalaupapa and her own leprosy accurately reflects that chapter of Hawaiian history. Conditions there were well known to Hawaiians in the 1890's and most of those who were diognosed with leprosy reluctantly accepted this confinement. A few others did not. On Kauai a leper called Koolau resisted the government's efforts to deport him and created an incident that resulted in martial law. The eventual annexation of Hawaii by the United States was to some extent dependent on leprosy control efforts. Deportation of lepers became a political as well as a medical necessity. (See ""A Medical Necessity,"" in THE WAY WEST: TRUE STORIES OF THE AMERICAN FRONTIER). The rush to quarantine and the crowding of facilities at Kalapapa resulted in the conditions about which Brennert writes so well."
5,Heartbreaking and Heartwarming!,"I am so lucky to have run across this book while browsing Amazon.com! Other reviewers have praised Moloka'i much better than I can, but I want to give it my 5 stars. I've been fortunate to have visited Moloka'i a couple of times, and have stood on the pali overlooking Kalaupapa thinking of those souls who had to spend their lives on that beautiful but isolated place. Rachel Kalama embodies the spirit of the Hawaiian people; those who love life, family, the land and the ocean."
3,Another sad story.,Sometimes I like an upbeat story. This book was a downer from beginning to end. Leprosy is such a tragic disease anyway and the inhumane way this little girl was treated was heartbreaking.
5,Moving historical fiction,"A moving account of the leprosy camps on Molokai. The main character is well developed, and the reader becomes quickly invested in her. The historical details are both informative and horrifying. It is a compelling story that, while sad, emphasizes the strength of the human spirit in times of adversity."
4,"Fascinating story of life as a leper in late 1800s, early/mid 1900's","I recommend the book. That being said, it is not an ""upper"" book so if you are looking for something light, this is not it.I learned a lot about what happened during the leper ostracism to Moloka'i. Very well written."
5,Wonderful!,"Both this book and his other book, Honolulu, are great reading. Not only will you learn more about the Hawaiian culture, but you have a very good read! I highly recommend both of them."
4,3 1/2 Stars - Glad I read it but it was dry at times,"If you enjoy historical fiction I think this book is worth reading though it drags in parts. I love historical fiction but it's annoying when the author makes every significant event or person in that time frame pop into the main character's life. Having said this, I'm still glad that I read the book and felt like I learned a lot."
4,Full of information,"""Moloka'i"", an incredibly well-researched novel by Alan Brennert, tells of 50 years in the history of Moloka'i in Hawaii, the colony for those diagnosed with leprosy (Hansen's disease). It begins with the story of Rachel Kalama as she is torn out of the fabric of her family in Honolulu at the age of 5 and taken to this faraway place.This is a heart-wrenching story, very detailed, and gives the reader a lot of information. I learned so much about this place....I had always known about it, but not in any detail. It was often shocking, but often heartwarming too.Four stars instead of five because I thought it got bogged down a little bit in places. But still well worth reading."
5,"Must Read for anyone wanting to know more about the people of Hawaii, especially the island of Moloka'i","I found this book as I was about to embark on a trip to Hawaii. I wanted to read something that was both fact and fiction, something that would give me some background to the land I was about to visit. This book gave me more than I could imagine. It follows nearly the entire life of Rachel Kalama, through her short life on Oahu and then her life on Moloka'i as an exiled leper. This book is rich in traditional Hawaiian culture and history - I highly recommend this read to anyone with a thirst for more knowledge about the people of Hawaii and the community in Kalaupapa, Moloka'i."
5,Great story with a lot of history as well,"If you love historical novels this book is a great read. It takes place in Hawaii, and you learn a lot about the treatment of those with leprosy as well as what life was like for them and others on the islands. The book also has great character development, a feature I enjoy in a book. The book also brings out many emotions...from tears to joy, a real roller coaster at times! I highly recommend this book!"
5,Imazing story,"Molokai was an amazing story with characters who seemed real.But not only a story, I learned so much about a terrible disease. As a child you always heard your friends say things like ""OH he's creepy, he's got leprosy"" not even realizing what the disease was. And that there was a leprosy colony in Hawaii seemed incredible. How could a 60+ person not know that such a place had existed. The tragedy of those individuals infected and cruel treatment pulls at your heart."
5,A WORK OF ART,"l have crossed stitch this quilt several times and it always looks great,a family heirloom each of my daughters have one from JANLYNN l also cross stitch the Birth Sampler to go with the quilt,its very easy to cross stitch beening stamped,a good buy in 20 years of cross stitch the price has only double. I would recommend this cross stitch because it has clear instructions,and graph is easy to follow, and with enough thread (floss) to finsh the quilt.a delight to stitch. happy stitching."
5,Diablo blades are the best.The only blades I will buy for my saws.,"I had shipping issues with Fed Ex. The first saw blade was never delivered. Home Depot stepped-up and replaced the blade,but I needed the blade in a time line for a project, so I had to make a trip to get another blade. I lost time and money because of shipping. I now have extra blades. I love Diablo blades and will not use any other brands."
1,moldy stuff,"it arrived with mold along the rim, I asked my wife, son and all confirm. I wanted to see who had the best bread pudding, Smokehouse and Hebert's Specialty Meats both arrived cold. Hebert's had a better sauce, Smokehouse had a yellow lemon sauce that had separated, but did nothing to improve it's rather bland flavor. I did get a limp wrist excuse from the company rep that a special topping is added to give it a moldy look and they would ship another one."
4,Mac OSX Version,"I was unable to install the initial version on my mac G4. I contacted the manufacturer who was very responsive. They said the initial version shipped with 2 problems in the Mac version. They were aware of the problem and sent me a beta of the corrected program. Later they sent my the final version. If you have problems, contact the manufacturer - my experience with them was very good.The content is as described and the quality is very good. The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5, is that it requires Microsoft Explorer to view the content. The browser plug in does not work with Safari. Perhaps that will come in a future version."
5,works as advertised,I used this to cut steel wall studs for a small project. Works great. Fits a standard saw. What else can you say about a saw blade...
2,"Good idea, good space saver, poor construction","THe towel bar is a great idea. It works great in my camper. However, the covers over the magnets are dented and have excess glue on them. On one of the towel bars, the rubber foot to prevent scratching the surface it hangs on, was broken. Very poorly made."
5,Excellent! A real joy.,"From the begining of this movie, when you spot Elizabeth Taylor having the temper tantrum of a lifetime, you *know* this is going to be a good time.I adored this movie!Kate and Bianca are sisters. Their father has decreed that the younger sister, even tempered Bianca, may not marry until her elder sister walks down the aisle. Unfortunately, Kate (Liz Taylor) has the disposition of a rattlesnake and is given to fits of anger. Thus far, it has put off any suitors, and Bianca frets that she'll never be allowed to marry. Then Pertruchio (Richard Burton) comes into the picture - a rather mad gentleman who is looking for a woman with a large dowry - and he pursues Kate, much to Kate's chagrin. Eventually, he tricks her into marriage. The honeymoon angst beings soon thereafter.Great acting, great sets, and beautiful costuming, The Taming Of The Shrew is a great time. I am very glad I bought this one. I'll be watching it over and over again, I can guarantee.Happy viewing."
5,A perfect romp,Could there be more perfect casting than Taylor & Burton? They're so ideal for these parts that it's virtually typecasting. But whether you're a fan of that famous duo or not this movie's simply great fun. This is such an easy film to enjoy that we find it's a good introduction for those not familiar with Shakespeare. Buy it and ENJOY!
5,Safe and entertaining,"I saw a glimse of this movie while in was traveling one day and I wanted to see the whole thing. I am a big fan of the older ""safer"" movies and am very glad I bought it. Highly entertaining! You will enjoy it if you like classic movies."
2,Annoying Acting,"I watched this movie only through Act II. I could no longer take the constant screaming and screeching by Elizabeth Taylor. I know that Kate is a shrew, and I've read the play several times, but that doesn't mean that the part of Kate must be played with continual screeching. There are other ways to manifest shrewishness without screeching (e.g., tone of voice). Also, why is there so much running around and banging when Petruchio meets Kate? It is unnecessary to the point of being slapstick, and it's distracting from the dialogue. Finally, this movie is not completely faithful to the play, which is something else that bothers me.I have watched three versions of this play (the Marc Singer version, this version, and the BBC version), and the Marc Singer version is the best one, IMO. In that version,the acting is superb."
2,late shipping,"I paid to have this come rush and it took 10 days the product itself was exactly what we wanted and great just too late in coming to be viewed before the audition,"
4,Good for the whole family,"Our friends also own this movie and they also enjoyed it. This is a 'movie within a movie' because the actors play 'actors in a Shakespeare play' - and their private lives parallel the play they're in. The 'play' in the movie stays true to the orignal Shakespeare ""Taming of the Shew""."
2,Beautiful but stupid,"The color cinematography in this Zefferelli opus is gorgeous, but the depiction of Katherine, the ""shrew"" of the title, is utterly ludicrous. Poor Liz Taylor spends the first hour with virtually no dialogue beyond scrams of rage. Why mount a movie of one of Shakespare's comedies if you're going to gag one of his most enchantingly verbal women? Listen to a cast recording of ""Kiss Me, Kate"" instead; at least Cole Porter used some of the Bard's language."
5,Burton and Taylor at their best,"If you're not a fan of Shakespeare's comedies, or a fan of Taylor and Burton, then seeing this flick will make you a fan of all three!From the rainy opening scene, to the brilliantly played climax at the end when 'the Shrew' (Taylor) complies with her 'Lord and Master's (Burton) ""order to come hither"" the talent of the original play, the script and (of course) the actors shines through in every scene.A more modern remake of this classic is ""Ten thing I hate about you"" - and I can heartily recommend that movie too!"
4,Great Works,"This DVD is in the tradition of Shakespeare with a more modern twist than the BBC version. I enjoyed the humour that is portrayed and Elizabeth gives an excellent ""shrew"" portrayal."
4,Elizabeth Taylor is the best Shrew,"There may be many people across the years who act in this play, but there will never be another production like Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton did. They are such convincing combatants -- they make the entire movie powerfully funny. A great Shakespearean comedy done very well."
5,Best Shakespeare Movie,"Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton brought Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew alive with the chemical attraction that made them legendary. The characterizations were so real and contemporary that even those who are not used to Shakespearian dialogue will be delighted. Each of the other characters were also perfectly cast and it was obvious that they were enjoying themselves. Artistic types will appreciate the set design and decoration and the memorable costumes. This is no dead story by a long dead playright. If you have seen the contemporary version ""Ten Things I Hate About You"" you owe it to yourself to see this film. My husband enjoyed it and he is a hard core action flick guy. It is well worth the 5 stars I gave it!"
4,HE THAT KNOWS BETTER HOW TO FILM A SHREW ...,"We never do find out the source of Elizabeth Taylor's 'shrew's' dicontent and the idea of a woman being dominated into submission of behavior doesn't wash today, this still is a highly amusing, greatly acted and lushly filmed version of Shakespeare's comedy. The late Richard Burton is superb and very funny as the oppurtunistic and and reckless Petruchio."
4,INTERESTING COMEDY!,Liz Taylor and Richard Burton make a funny pair in this Shakespeare story. They're able to show their passion and tension for eachother on the screen rather well. Times may have changed since Shakespeare's time but the heart still beats to the same tune. Great costumes too!
2,A totally ludicrous film,"I expected to be thoroughly entertained by this film, but I wasn't. It was very bad, and the acting didn't help. None of the 'brilliant young research students' seemed to have a brain cell between them, half the time nothing happened and when it did it was totally unconvincing. Richard Attenborough, who only appears for about five minutes, seemed to be playing Father Christmas once again and the only actor who was convincing was a James Faulkner as the token bad guy professor. Even he had to show a 'nice' side in the end and have an emotional 'reunion' with his ghastly daughter. If it had been a slasher movie, I'd have wanted her to be the first to die, so I felt quite sorry for him. A waste of time and money."
1,Dissatisfied customer,"Product produces only a minimum amount of steam, you get a better ""facial"" taking a shower than using this ""Sauna"". It would take an unacceptable amount of time for this product to ever produce a ""deep cleansing effect"" as advertised. Would not recommend this product to others."
4,Little romance in these smugglers,"There are probably much better books on smugglers than this one - or at least much broader ones, but this is pretty competent account of smuggling as it was in the southern counties of England (mostly Sussex and Kent) in the middle of the eighteenth century - and more particularly, the activities of the violent and bloody Hawkhurst gang. These men were not the types of gentlemen one would like to suffer disagreements with and this is borne out in the second half of the book which retells the Hawkhurst Gang's hideous murders of Richard Hawkins and a year later the more infamous ones of Galley and Chater. The account of these murders is extremely graphic, most detail in this book has been drawn from the transcripts of the perpetrators trial. Definitely interesting, but not for the faint hearted.It is illustrated but only in line drawings and there is a short but reasonable bibliography at the end to follow up any of the detail further."
4,Well written and well documented.,"This book is very informative and well written. It provides good insight into the cultural aspects of the Ulster-Scot immigrates. It was very helpful to me in my quest to determine whether my ancestors were Highlanders, Lowlanders, or Scotch-Irish."
1,REDUNDANCY AND BIAS,"THE AUTHOR FAILS TO CREAT A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE PALESTINIANS AND THE ISRAELIS ARE IN. THE LACK OF CLEAR PRESPECTIVE OF THE DUALITY OF THE PROBLEM CREATS A ONESIDED VIEW OF THE TRAGIDY AND OFFERS NO CLEAR EXPLANATION TO THE REAL ISSUES FACING BOTH PEOPLE, EACH IN THEIR OWN STRUGGLE.A CLEAR DISAPPOINTMENT FROM SOMEONE LIKE MR. HALABI WHO BUILDS HIS REPUTATION AS SOMONE WHO KNOWS THE DYNAMICS AND THE PLAYERS IN THE ISRAELI PALESTINIAN CONFLICT.I ADVISE MR. HALABI TO KEEP ON READING (NEWS) NOT TO WRITE."
3,Missing the point - again,"Rhino has assembled a good collection of commercially popular disco tunes, but the real reason for disco's popularity - the extended mixes that created the backbone of club culture and enabled people to dance for hours - has eluded them. All the tracks featured in this collection are radio edits. Consequently, the listener is faced with a collection of dated ditties rather than hearing the tunes as they were meant to be heard: dancefloor epics that sweep you up. Significant misdemeanours include Love Hangover, Don't Leave Me This Way, and You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real), all of which rely on extended intros and breaks for the desired impact. If you have fond memories of these tracks as radio highlights then you'll enjoy this collection; If, however, you want to groove to the roots of today's dance music culture, look elsewhere."
5,Great Collection!,"This is an exceptional collection that most people would find enjoyable. I bought this album (along with the 6 other volumes) years ago, but I still play it a few times a year. The well-known hit songs during this time period are here: ""The Hustle"", ""Disco Inferno"", and ""Love Hangover"".This is my suggestion: You must buy the other six volumes. Sure, even if you buy those there are still LOTS of notable songs missing. What Rhino tried to do was gather the well-known songs instead of ""rare, hard-to-find"". The packaging is superb: nice liner notes, pictures, and song credits."
4,Disco Highlights From the 1970s,"The first and best of Rhino's ""Disco Years"" compilations. ""Turn the Beat Around"" offers 16 dance tracks ranging from Van McCoy's ""The Hustle"" to The Trammps' ""Disco Inferno."" Notable artists include KC & The Sunshine Band, Rose Royce and Thelma Houston. All that's missing are Donna Summer and Chic (both featured in later Rhino volumes). Though a memorable time capsule, you should look elsewhere for extended club mixes - preferably Rebound's excellent ""Disco Nights"" series."
4,Great Information,"The information in the book is awesome and a lot of mustang performance ideas are given. The only problem is that it is a little out-dated. Overall, a good read and a very useful resource."
4,"Getting Better But Still not the True V.C, Andrews",If you are a true V.C. Andrews fan then you will like this new series. This is one of the better series. I hope that the rest of the books to the series will be as good as the first two.I found myself reading the book every moment I had free. I could not put it down. Soon I started entering the characters lives and feeling the emotions that they were going through. I started having troubles differentiating between the book and real life situations. It is a must read for all V.C. Andrews fans!I can do with out the letters in the back of the book. Those series and they have nothing on this series.
3,"Good, but predictable, as usual.","Okay, let me start off by saying I've been a V.C. Andrews fan for almost 20 years. HER books were much better then, much better than the books the ghostwriter puts out now. Why? Because he uses a formula to write these books.Now this book had a great story. A ritzy lifestyle, interesting people, fancy mansions. I liked Willow and wanted to know more after reading it and this book picked up the trail really well. However, it was VERY predicatble, even for fans who have only read a couple of the V.C. Andrews books. Yep, things are going to look rosy for Willow for a bit, but as a fan, I KNEW something bad would happen right before the ending and it did. Typical. But, all in all, this one has a great storyline and interesting characters and was a really quick read. Great for any V.C. Andrews fan.And, as for those awful letters at the end of these books. Give me a break..."
3,Okay but mainly disappointing,"I have to say at the beginning of this new series I was excited and hoped it would be the start of something better by the ghostwriter. However, I was disappointed with Wicked Forest. First off the whole thing with the letter from other characters from differents series was silly and a real stretch. The whole thing with Willow marrying the professor so quickly was a bit out of character (at least in my opinion) and we knew nothing about him!I would have to say that Bunny and the rest of the ""townies"" were very colorful and kept the book going.Overall I was pretty disappointed. I will probably read the next one for the sake of continuing the series."
2,Predictable,"After reading the first Debeers book, I was greatly disappointed. Back then when it first came out, I still had faith and hope in Mr. Neiderman's writing and hoped that he would go back to putting effort into the books he ghostwrote for the VCA name. But this book was plodding and shallow, and I found myself frustrated with the ending, along with Willow's sheer stupidity and refusal to confront the truth about her philandering husband, and how sloppily the book was put together."
2,Ok,"I thought the first book was oalright, so I decided to try the second. I didn't like it as much.I don't feel that this book was very well written. I found it to get quite boring and twisted."
2,AAARRRGGG!!,"this book was doing bueatifully... until that thatcher thing. i won't give it away, but that was totally out of charactor. it seemed like the author got bored and decided to cause some chaos. believe me, it shows."
2,zzzzz....,"Ok, the second book in a VC Andrews series are ususally pretty good (in Dark Angel's case-one of her top 3 best) It's usually the 3rd or 4th book where things go down hill think-If There Be Thorns, Gates Of Paradise and the all-time worst in my opinion Twilight's Child) Anyway, in this case, the writer seems determined to ruin the saga in only the 2nd book. After the promising Willow I expected much better from this one. It's mostly boring with a crazy (but recycled) twist at the end in which a charachter goes insane and holds Willow captive) the humorous bits w/ that Palm Beach ladies club were it's only saving grace and Willow's new relationship seemed awfully rushed"
4,Closet VCA,"I have been trying to kick the VCA habit for years (I'm 35). I'm proud to say that I quit the miniseries a couple of years ago, but am still reading the full-size book series. The ghostwriter must be reading these reviews, because the DeBeers series shows an improvement that I hope will last. A problem of the books that came after the Casteel series has been that the young protagonists are too ""wide-eyed"" for someone living in the 21st or late-20th centuries. Young people have sharpness, and Willow seems more modern than Rain Hudson or Dawn Cutler. The dialogue has also become sharper and pithier, which was sorely needed! Linden Montgomery is definitely the best ""unstable brother"" in ages!"
3,not feeling this one,"i love v.c. andrews books and have many of them. this one here though, it was really drawn out and though the story line was interesting, it didnt hold my attention as well as any of the other series i have read. to much extra detail for me and it took to long to get to the point. it also didnt keep the excitement rolling like previous series i have read. i loved willows character though. i agree with some of the other reviews about the letters in the back of the book...corny. hopefully i wont have to give a ""three"" rating to the next book in the series, this one was kind of disappointing. worth having in your collection if you are a true fan though."
3,Wicked Forest,"This book had me bored out of my mind. About 3/4 of the way through is the only time it held my interest. Why did Willow marry Thatcher Eaton? I thought Willow was a mature, smart women. Apparently everyone but her could tell that Thatcher had been cheating on her. Duh Willow.I like her occasional bad attitude. Her snide remarks to the locals actually was kind of humerous."
3,Why?,"Can someone please explain to me why Willow marries the arrogant, ridiculous, unfaithful Thatcher Eaton? It's so pointless."
3,Another good book,"I have read all of V.C. Andrews books and whilst I did enjoy this one, I think it was a bit predictable at times. There weren't any big twists with this one. Still a good read, though. :)"
3,falls short of expectations,"The Debeers series started out sounding quite promising. I liked how Willow's character was developed to be an intelligent, analytical, skeptical young woman, much different from the bubbly, naive, "" i believe in magic"" heroines of other VC books. Willow actually had some substance. However, this book seemed way too drawn out and at times, just completely dull. Throughout the book, Willow is taken through the glamourous and corrupt world of the filthy rich. But somehow her life seems completely boring, even with the romantic interludes with Thatcher. I was, however, glad that Thatcher's character turned out the way he did. I never liked him from the first and anticipated that he was holding something back. The whole incest storyline with Linden was nothing short of irritating, and the ending was way too rushed and unrealistic. Thus far the Debeers books have ended with bland, even dreary endings that have left me unsatisfied. I'm hoping the future books will be better."
4,"Fiber Optic Ref. Guide ""great illustrations & diagrams""","I highly recommend this book if you are just learning about fiber optic principles and theory, or have gaps in knowledge that need to be filled. This book has very good explanations, illustrations, and diagrams. This is written to the technician audience and hands-on field engineer, but is also a good reference that even a EE engineer will find useful & handy.I found this book invaluable when I had to teach others in the subject matter."
5,"Mucho Ritmo, Muy bien mezclada.","Este remix de Cristian esta lleno de energia . Bien vale la pena si te latio el album anterior de ""Mi Vida Sin Tu Amor."""
1,Bad Latin-Disco-Sounds,"Hello, i wanted to know what for a wonderful singer gives the song POR AMARTE ASI his voice. This song is very beautiful but i was very dissappointed when I heard the other songs from the CD. The point goes for POR AMARTE ASI. Continue with songs like this. The other kinds are a waste of voicetalent."
5,Wonderful product! Just wonderful!,"This product is the best! The company, Raintree, was forced out of business by the damned FDA because this product works very well!!! Can you imagine?! I feel I will buy this product again in the future. I hope this company never stops making this wonderful product!An incredible product!"
4,graviola,THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR AMUNINE SYSTEM. AND OF COURSE THE SERVICE IS UNMATCHED. IF YOUR FEELING TRIED THIS IS WORTH A TRY.
3,LOGO WARNING!!!!!,"Very enjoyable little films about the Alamo if you can survive the horrible large bright logo ""the Alamo"" in the corner of both films. This greatly ruins the viewing experience and is a despicable practice. That is why this only gets 3 stars. The Heroes of the Alamo print is a bit dark but is otherwise fine with no splices and is a Columbia Pictures print. The 36 surviving minutes of Davy Crockett At the Fall of the Alamo is a tinted print which looks pretty decent. If not for the logo issue, this would have been a very good release. What's the point of releasing films like this(especially the surviving footage), if it is going to be multilated like this."
3,Great book for Pagans,"This book has been described as a ""Frothy Pagan Rant"" and that's really about on the mark but if you're into that sort of thing it's probably right up your alley. The author is a pagan and a bee keeper so she knows the practical business of making mead right out of the comb. She's also a bit easier to understand than other authors. She includes sample rituals as well as many recipes (including one for pumpkin) and goes a bit into the legal aspects of home brewing. A good book for pagans that want a well-rounded education when it comes to mead. Non-pagans might find it a bit over the top though. Hell, I'm a druid and I think she needs to take a chill pill too."
5,Fun AND educational... in one book?,"YES!! This book is well worth any price. It is am easy read, with entertaining images and catch phrases. Of the 5 mead books we bought, this one is by far our favorite. Though we have yet to taste the bounties from the knowledge we gained from this book, we were able to breeze through the purchasing our mead kit and the first batch with ease!"
2,Not tight enough,"I bought this product thinking of my 12 year old son who has a terrible posture. I always say to him that he looks like the hunchback of Notre Dame.It could be that he is very thin and tall, but this band did nothing. It should have gradual hooks to adjust to different types of bodies. It was too loose and didn't do what it was supposed to do.I tried it, but found it extremely unconftable after a couple of hours.I will not recommend this Posture Band."
3,"Slightly uncomfortable, but okay...","About what I expected. It does dig into your underarms a little bit, but it does make a difference, if you adjust it to the right size. Don't wear it ALL day when you first get it - ease into it, or you'll be just as uncomfortable as you were before. I'd recommend it if you need something to get you started on working on your posture."
2,doesnt do much,"this product really didnt help me with my posture. it hurt my arm pits, it was diffucult to get on and off and you can see it through clothing. I dont reccomend it to anybody who isnt very thin."
3,straps come undone easily,"The straps come undone easily, and you can easily see it under a bra and tshirt, but with a sweater/sweatshirt over it, it's not bad. It does work as a 'reminder' to straighten up posture, but still leaves plenty of room for poor posture/slouching.A better alternative would be to work those muscles at the gym or at home to strengthen them, thus, less likely to slouch."
1,Works but hurts,"I ordered one of these to help my posture. It definitely pulls your shoulders back which does, in fact, help your posture. The problem is that the straps cut off the blood flow to your arms. Your arms start tingling and that's just the start of its uncomfortableness. After a while, the straps bruised my arms. My posture was corrected wearing it but the price on my physical comfortableness was too high to pay."
2,Good Concept Poor Design,"Needed something to pull the shoulder blades back - have developed ""wings"" over the years of poor posture! The design is very poor in practical wearing. The fabric under the arms resembles velcro and very irritating & tight, without any adjustment for the armpit area. The center fastener does not stay in place - level with the shoulder blades - which further irritates the armpits by continuing to creep up toward the neck. Agree with another poster, this would be much more effective with a front adjustable band/strap to keep in proper position. Wearing does make me more aware of my posture which reminds me to correct the ""wing thing"" by standing with shoulders back. BTW I am 5'5"" & 120 pounds, so I cannot imagine how uncomfortable this would be on someone taller or with developed shoulders, arm muscles, etc."
3,Kinda Sorta,"I've definitely become aware of when I don't have my shoulders properly pulled back. But is it supposed to do more than that? I don't know if it's really working or not.I don't feel bad for the money I paid for it though, and that's always a plus."
1,Cut bloodflow to arms,First this band was really difficult to put on. Then after wearing it a short while I could feel the bloodflow to my arms being cut right from the armpits. I couldn'd wear it.
2,Works as advertised,I could not wear it for very long or on successive days. I put it up and forgot it since it was hard to put on as well. It is in the drawer unused.
1,TERRIBLE,"The arm straps are very tight and press hard upwards against your armpits. It feels like it's cutting off circulation to your arm. The material is also kind of rough so there's a burning feeling wherever there's pressure/contact. It leaves marks on your skin after wearing it for only a few minutes.It's also very hard to wear it like the picture. The band wants to crawl upwards to your neck, which in turn would pull your neck down, and hurt your posture!I'm just a average built guy, but I tend to slouch. So I think most people would experience the same difficulty with this as I did. The only reason I bought this was because I was intrigued after seeing it on a Sky Mall Catalog. I couldn't find any customer reviews for it, so I took a chance and bought one (for under $10). I guess the lesson is: you get what you pay for."
2,Uncomfortable,"I think this is the kind of thing that is only effective in that, because you are aware that it is there, you may learn to keep your shoulders back. Why are you aware that it's there? Because it's uncomfortable!Also, it rides up in back so that it ceases to be as effective as when you first put it on."
1,not worth it,"As the sating goes "" you get what you pay for"" :(The strap is one size firs all but it doesnt fit normal size women. Its very large which defeats the purpose of it.I would say pay the extra money and buy a supportive one that works"
1,Okay,"Underworks posture perfect band... This was ok, but not what I was expecting. I wanted something to hold my shoulders back so I wouldn't be slouched all the time. This does not to the trick; it's too big for one (5""7, female, broader than most) and it lets me slouch in it. I am trying to find something else."
3,"It's functional, but uncomfortable","It pretty much gets the job done: It helps to train you to keep your shoulders back and improves your posture. But it's really uncomfortable, and you can't wear it long enough for it to be truly effective at improving your posture. It cuts off circulation, even when you are keeping your shoulders back and standing up straight."
3,posture bra,"Watch for upper arm circulation when wearing this support; otherwise, it gives a bit of support and improves posture after wearing it."
1,Use less,Does not support your posture at all because it rises to the point that it nearly touches your neck and it is very uncomfortable. the makers need to go back to the drawing board with this one.
2,A bit uncomfortable,I tried this product though I found it a bit uncomfortable under the arms. I wasn't able to wear it all day but will try again.
1,Disappointment,The strap slides up the longer u wear it until it rubs at the base of your neck...very annoying. I tried wearing it just while sleeping and the bands just dug into my skin.
1,To small,This product is to small broad shouldered people. It does not state the maximum expansion. Be leery of this product.
3,"Good, but not","I had high hopes for this...at first it was great...then, after about 10 minutes, it started to shift. It would not stay put. The middle part ends up at your neck...try to fix that discretely at work! It definitely shows under your clothes unless you are wearing a sweat shirt with a hood. I need to find something else..."
1,ouch,"This item just shipped today, and I couldn't wait to try it. Totally uncomfortable! Very revealing under clothes. The left arm strap was actually constructed twisted which made the left side even more uncomfortable than the right. The straps roll into a cord regardless of an undershirt or near the skin, and the the section that attaches the hooks to the actual straps isn't as wide as the photo shown. I feel if I had received that one I might be happier with the product. I did give it one star because it did pull my shoulders back and improved my posture. Totally not worth the pain."
4,Great Help,"I found this product to be a great help in reminding me to keep my shoulders back. It's a little difficult to get off, but it wouldn't be doing you any good if it wasn't tight enough. You definitely need to wear it over a tee shirt, as it would leave your armpits raw otherwise. I have some neck problems, and found I could only wear it for a couple of hours without it putting too much strain on my neck. But that's been enough. Doing that has helped me to remember to keep my shoulders back throughout the day. For the price, it's a great product."
2,Didn't Help,This product did not help me at all and was too inexpensive to bother to return. It ended up going to Goodwill.
2,Posture Aid,I really felt this didn't provide enough aid as I was looking for. The bands are too stretchy that it really didn't help hold my shoulders back.
1,Be cautious of this product,"I think this product would work, but one size does not fit all. I am small, but not so small that a general one size should not fit me, especially since it has an adjustable back. I had this closed all on the smallest hooks and it still was sagging on me. I think it would work, but you must have broad shoulders and a broad back. Don't trust the picture, I don't know how they made it fit that woman."
1,Useless,"I found that this did nothing to help my posture and is extremely uncomfortable. It hardly keeps your shoulders back. If you slouch, you might be better off with something that has more lower back support."
2,not very good,There isn't much to this item. It is flimsy and supplies no structural stability to improving posture. Be leery of cheap items in the future and those that prey on those who choose cheaply.
2,posture strap,"I bought the stap for my daughter who is big busted for a small framed teen. I could see her starting to hunch her back alot so I decided to try it. She says its not uncomfortable, but it does look bulky under her shirts."
3,ok for the price,"This strap is ok for the <$7 price. It holds the shoulders back, but doesn't' really stay situated on the proper place on the back. The straps cut into my arms and I couldn't wear it under clothes."
1,No support,This product is not tight enough to force you to stand up straight. It's just an added hassel. And the other reviews were correct; it hurts your armpits.
2,better idea than reality,"This is a good idea, and did hold my shoulders back. The problem was, it cuts in under my armpits and after a few hours it was unbearable. I'm considering trying to work up to wearing it longer, but the discomfort is holding me back--for now"
2,Rides up...,"After wearing this brace for 20 minutes on the tightest setting, it stretched out and did not pull my shoulders back like it is designed to. It also started to ride up my back towards my neck which made it entirely useless. I guess you do get what you pay for... the shipping was as much as the product!"
3,It does work,"This product actually works fairly well. The only problems I encountered were that it hurts your arms, it rides up and becomes ineffective and if you put it in the washer and dryer it will stretch out and no longer work. If you hand wash it and put it over your bra, or an undershirt it works pretty well, considering the cheap price. If you have the money however, I would recommend shelling it out for better quality product."
1,does not work at all!,"First of all, one size fits all is not the case for this product! I am a 32/34 band size and it was far too big for me. I wouldn't suggest even trying this product unless you are at least a 36/38 band size. It did absolutely nothing for my posture! It doesn't straighten your back up and correct posture, all I would think that it'd do (for people that it fits) is pull your shoulder back a tiny bit, but it wouldn't make you stand up straight. Not worth my money at all. Being returned asap!"
3,Posture Perfect Band,"I am satisfied with the posture bands and after buying 2 posture bands last year, I ordered 6 of them recently. I had read all the negative reviews, and agree these comments are correct. However the posture bands help remind me to keep my shoulders back. To keep the posture bands from riding up on the back of my neck I attached them to my bra.They are soft, flexible, easy to wash and fairly comfortable. If I want more shoulder pull power I use two of them at a time. That is why I now have 8 of them and use them every day for a better posture and better appearance."
1,posture bra,This product does hold your shoulders back thus improving posture. It is however terribly uncomfortable. It is perhaps the most uncomfortable thing I've ever worn. It slips constantly and shows when it does. It caused chaffing in the armpits.
3,Good for the price,This product does what it says it will do and is fine for the price but it is not very comfortable.
2,Not one size fits all,This product is far too small to be one size fits all. I usually wear a small or medium and it is tight on me under the arms. The strange thing is it is very loose in the shoulders right where it shouldbe tight. It falls out of place very easily. It isnt a functional design.
3,Nice,"I accidentally came to this cd and ended up buying it cause somebody i liked had an guest apperance on it. Nobody really know who he is.I ened liking some song on here. But he has a couple of good songs on this where my baby at is good,fever for the freak is good it sounds like a freaky r kelly type beat,and bomb sexx is good because Adina howard is on it. Thats why i brought the cd i love her. (...) This is decent."
4,Landmark History of the American People,"This is a great book to read with your children. The information is presented with an unbiased slant. The black and white pictures are excellent, they really give a feel for the period. A hard back copy would be great."
3,Dogs and Dads,"The pictures are great, but I would have like for each person photographed in the book to tell how the dog(s) came to live with them. Also, I would like to know what having the dog(s)means to the life of each person featured in this book. I am a cat person, and last year I was able to get a cat after so many years without one. However, I am very interested in the relationship people have with their pet dogs and cats."
2,missed opportunities,"It wasn't a bad idea for the Russians to decide to create lip-synched films of 2 short ""outdoorsy"" operas, but the bad ideas came from the directors & cinematographers who blew the chance to create something truly worthwhile. First, the color quality is dismal in both films & the camera lingers far too often on extraneous material (campfires in Aleko, greenery in Kashchey). In addition to the gratuitous ""frame"" for Aleko (the opera itself doesn't start until 6 minutes into the film), there are inexplicable & unjustifiable deletions from the scores of both operas - the Young Gypsy's Romance in Aleko & the choral sections of Kashchey. I gave this DVD 2 stars only because I value the opportunity to see (most of) Aleko - an opera I've always enjoyed on disc - as well as (most of) Kashchey (which I also have on CD but find less musically rewarding than Aleko)."
4,gabby in the 70s,"All the songs on this album were recorded in the 70s, the majority coming from two albums: ""the Gabby Pahinui Hawaiian Band"" and ""Gabby"" (aka the brown album), both great albums on their own. the songs are mixed well, making this collection stand on it's own.These songs were mostly originally recorded with Gabby and his friends and family with guitars, steel guitar, and bass. Ry Cooder even shows up on a couple cuts playing mandolin. The musicianship is superb. Some of the cuts have strings and synthesizers added, which may or may not distract you, depending on your point of view. For instance, ""Moonlight Lady"" (sung by Gabby's son Bla) is laced with added strings. It's a great song, but i'd love to hear it in it's original form before the embellishment.This a great Hawaiian album to add to your collection. Or, get any one of Gabby's albums. The two listed above are probably Gabby's best, if you can find them."
1,Crap phone interview.,"Some guy that produced, directed and edited and composed the background music of this video called Stanton on the phone. A 20 minute interview was conducted over the phone. For the video there is some looping content of lights flashing in the sky at night."
2,Cheesy,"I have collected most of the cd's in this series. This one I think was a bad theme to make music for. Its well done for some people, but not me."
2,bad tech support,"The card worked ok. some times gets sound click when play or edit sound track.Cons: no custom service or support in US. Had issue with phantom power, emailed few times to UK support. Never got solution. Only ask for Serial No.Don't recommended."
4,Percy Faith has a great orchestra,"I really ordered this collection for CDs 2&3. Percy Faith provided the music for many chart topping vocal songs. Later he played the music for instrumental hits of his own. So, many of these songs are the instrumental portion and I really like the catchy tunes. You will probably recognize a lot of hits from the 1960s."
1,Buyer Beware,"I have now ordered this album TWICE from ImportsCds and both came packaged with TWO disc 1's and NO disc 3. They keep telling me to send it back and that there is no way to check quality assurance. Obviously, the factory has screwed up but the company won't take responsibility to make it right.Stay away."
4,huge help,"Ok so this is what you do:1. get some planetary geared pegs, they exist2. get a real tailpiece not plastic, you willnot need fine tuners with the geared pegs,(by the way these geared pegs are forviolins and they drop the weight of addingfine tuners, plus slipping pegs suck)3. you get a nice bridge and sand it down to amedium height4. this is optional, you either sport for aluthier to add frets to a real fretboard oryou add a ""fiddle fretter""Then you will have a fairly awesome/cheap electric fiddle. I play the bass and crossed over not too long ago with this setup, you want to get into those screaming octaves with some serious hoorah this is the way to start. Of course for me the bass is still my first love, but even an electric guitar I've passed over numerous times..... this thing fits the bill."
2,poor product,"When ordering this item i did expect it to be cheaply made to an extent, due to the low price, but i had never imagined to this poorness. The strings need to be replaced, they are very poorly put on to begin with, and are not the best quality anyways. I also had an issue with the plastic string pegs not staying as tightly as i set them at. They would slip loose while not even playing it. Also the wooden bridge it came with needed to be filed to the right shape. Overall i was very disappointed with this product."
2,Very Cheap,We still have not been able to get the bridge on it for my daughter to play it very frustrating.
1,Chin rest and strings,"Nothing was put together and one string was broken, also the chin rest fell off !!!!!Not happy with this product."
1,Poor quality,No amp included as per product description. Pegs missing. Would have returned it if it was possible. Complained to supplier with no response.
2,Electric Violin,"It does not come with any instructions, it looked used. I went to tighten one of the wires and it snapped. I plugged in the headphones after putting the battery in and turning it on and heard nothing. I think it was a waste of money."
3,"Painful to make it work... When it does, its fine.","I bought this program to sync my lotus note application.The installation is actually very simple... if you know what you are doing. Problem is, the instructions that come with the program are horrible. Thus, you'll probably have to call support at some point because even the web site doesn't offer better information on installing the application and configuring it with your desktop application.I was on hold for 45 minutes with support. They were friendly and helpful when they finally got on the phone. I did have to make a follow up call the next day. This time, I was only on hold for about 5 minutes.The sad thing is that Puma Tech could and should invest the minimal resources it requires to put together a good instruction manual."
3,great for beginers in spiritual warfare,"This book is a great start for beginers in spritiaul warfare but does not go as indepth as some others. I would highly recommend Dr. Knotts book on spiritual warfare called, ""Contending for the Faith."" If you like this book and would like to learn more than you will want to check it out also."
5,The Authority of the Believer,"This book has opened my eyes to the book of Ephesians and the great position the Lord gives us if we only believe in the authority He has given us. The author uses words that are not ordinary vocabulary so you need a good dictionary and the Word. All in all, you will love this book and it's revelations."
2,Ebook Not the Same,"The books is supposed to be 176 page, but the ebook is only around 20 pages. What happened? I'm not sure what to rate this book, because the ebook is not the same thing."
4,off the chain is this book,This book is awesome! great read. if wanting to know your authority. I always believed that if you want to fight effectively you must know your rights and authority in God.
3,Authority vs. Power,"This essay helps to clarify difference between Authority and Power, which should benefit those who get discouraged in their ministry. MacMillan was born the latter half of the 1800s and was a missionary of distinction. His style of writing, compared with modern-day authors, is somewhat stilted but, nevertheless, informative. Also, the e-book contains many typos which are a bit of a distraction."
2,Kindle version needs massive editing effort!,The spelling and punctuation errors on nearly every page were just too distracting for me to finish the book. Amazon's request that I provide page numbers for the errors to submit to the publisher is a cop-out.
4,I'd Buy It If It Wasn't Called A Diablo,"I would probably buy this blade if it wasn't called a Diablo. I'm looking for a well-made, 10 inch diameter circular saw blade for cutting aluminum.Now, I understand the Freud company makes some very good products. But I haven't been able to talk myself into mounting an extremely sharp metal disk on my miter saw: that'll spin at around 3500 rpm, is red, is called a Diablo (that means Devil in Spanish-- I looked it up), and has a drawing of a devil on it.Yeah, call me supersitious."
5,Solid performer,"I used this blade in my $200 10"" DeWalt chopsaw and the results were great. I cut quite a bit of 80/20 extrusions (1515, 1530, 3030) and everything turned out clean and accurate. I used my shop vac to catch much of the swarf. With cutting fluid, I got nearly polished cuts. Definitely clamp things well and make sure your saw is tuned up and squared for best results. It actually performs pretty well in wood in a pinch."
2,Good product - Poor Company,"Buyers please beware if you think you may have questions about this item, or may happen to need any assitance if there is something wrong with your order. Please also note that what it tells you in the descritpion may not be what you are likely to receive.I ordered this product, but mine said in the description that it came with headphones that matched the skin as well as a lanyard. What I received was the Adrenaline skin alone. Do not get me wrong, it is a decent product by itself. I have, however made several or more inquiries to the company as to why my order was not the same as specified and have not gotten any feedback whatsoever and it has been several weeks. Very, very poor, in the realms of being NON-EXISTENT customer service. Please shop with caution."
4,Great for camping,I bought this for my 9 year old. We took it camping and he loved playing it. It's fun and easy and a great way to work on creative skills and play a family game.
5,Boggle: addictive menace or key to world peace?,Are you even thinking about not buying boggle? Bad idea. Wait. Fiiiineeee.... Yeeessss.... DON'T buy boggle. More boggle for me.Boggle = life
5,Discovered Again - Again!,"I first heard this cd as an album over 25 years ago that was somewhat experimental at the time. Dave Grusin recorded directly to the vinyl, as opposed to taping first, editing, and then pressing to vinyl. It's basically a live and uncut album - now cd. Still on the cutting edge musically, the songs are varied in style and creative; from jazz to haunting melodies to ""cowboy."" It's time for the next generation to ""discover"" him."
5,must have,I have the original direct disc recording on a record album. a must for jazz lovers. now can play in car.
2,"Somewhat interesting, but weakly structured","The whole idea of the postmodern novel has been rather disintegrated in this book. Hagedorn makes it seem as if giving a slice of life can never reconcile with an actual plot. If anyone has read Salman Rushdie or Marquez, that is obviously untrue. For the other folks, I'm truly sorry you haven't read anything worthwhile written in the past 30 years. In the end the entire theme of coming to age has been hastily written in the last thirty or so pages and everything else before was simple background to the terrible life that most of the characters experienced. If you want something thats almost strikingly similar in style and statire to this novel, read Ishmael Reed's phenominal Mumbo Jumbo."
1,A DIFFICULT READ,"I know I was supposed to love this book, but I couldn't finish it. It's fragmented and difficult to read."
2,Negative,"I read this book beacuse of all the good reviews. But I ended up being very disappointed. As a Filipina, I feel that this book gives a very negative portrayal of the people in the Philippines. I don't recommend this book at all."
4,Dogeaters,"Dogeaters offers its postmodern readers a grand perspective on identity, its fragmentation, and importance to the individual. In a brillant fashion its interrupted narrative and wild plot (I hestitate to say plot-line)remind readers of the dangers we all face as we strive to become individuals, and that complete self-actualization might come at the cost of community. Though ostensibly about the Philippines, this is a novel of every-person living in a consumer society, dreaming the sweet dreams that come from the collective nervous center (hollywood)."
2,Not so sure I'd recommend,"The cover art is very intriguing but the book itself is somewhat confusing to follow. It jumps around a lot and did nothing to shed some ""good"" light on the country of the Phillipines. If anything it fed the typical stereotypes about the people and culture and trying to get a good sense of the time periods it dealt with was really difficult. If anything, I would have enjoyed it more if the book was focused on only one or two characters and told a longer story about them instead of jumping around on 6-8 different people."
4,Tightly Written Novel,"This is the 1st novel I've ever read by author Jessica Hagedorn and what a great novel it is! ""Dogeaters"" is an extremely well written work of art. It is a fast paced novel and has a diverse cast of characters, which keeps the novel interesting.""Dogeaters"" is set in Manila and touches upon a wide range of topics within its covers... Such topics as religion, politics, drug addiction, prostitution, and homosexuality, rich vs. poor, etc. The only difficulty I had with this novel was trying to keep track of who all the different characters were.So, if you're looking for a great read, then check out this novel."
5,ok,hope to find more books to get ideas and learn more techniques to use in a classroom environment for great students.
4,Working with Precious Metal Clay,"Part 2 -- ""Technical tips"" and part 3 -- ""Tools you can make"" of this book are very helpful. This book, however, is not for people without PMC/Silver Art Clay and/or metalworking experience. Since author of this book is a master of metalwork, although anybody who has experience with play dough can use PMC/Silver Art Clay, Mr. McCreight put a heavy focus on combining PMC with traditional way of making silver projects. If you already have basic knowledge on PMC/Silver Art Clay and metalworking, this is a book for you. If you are looking for a non-traditional way of using new material -- PMC/Silver Art Clay -- and trying to learn creative way of using this material from this book, you may be as disappointed as I do."
3,Precious Metal Clay by Tim McCreight,"I was so disappointed. Most of Tim McCreight's books are terrific and packed full of helpful tips and cost saving ideas. This book was written for the novice who has no jewelry experience. I thought it would be much more advanced. The back information was helpful, but it seems like Tim may have ""rushed"" to get this book in print and left out so many other PMC possibilities.. ones that I was so anxious to know about."
4,Good start!,"I have to admit, I skipped all the projects and headed straight to the back for tips and tools. For the information provided on both subjects alone, I give this book 4 stars. It is indeed a beginner's guide of sorts, not for someone with experience looking for creative ideas. Spiral bound makes it a wonderful working reference."
2,Not her writing,"This of course is the sequel of ""Alone"" and I'll ask the same question: where's the plot? After read so many excellent books written by LG like: ""The Other Daughter"", ""The Next Accident"", ""The Survivorss Club"", ""The Perfect Husband"" among many others I'd think that LG didn't wrote these two stories. I cant't believe that after writing so many books that you can't close she wrote this kind of gibberish. I'm still a great LG's fan and I'll be waiting for the next one. But this surely is not her kind of writing."
2,Ending and forced romance bring this down from 4 to 2 stars,"I was initially hooked by Hide as it has the premise for an interesting story. However, about half way through the book the author felt the need to force a romance into the situation, described in formulaic bodice-ripper, romance-novel style, which was superfluous and began the descent of my star rating. Then the ending, which seemingly came from nowhere and felt extremely contrived was the final star-dropper. This was a free download supposedly given away to entice more Gardner sales but it had just the opposite effect in my case."
4,Twists And Turns Galore!,"Detective Bobby Dodge and Detective D.D. Warren are at it again. Despite the sexual tention between them they work well together. Lisa Gardner has a way of making these two characters so real that they jump off the page. ""Hide"" is the second of a series and I can't wait to bite into the next one. There were so many twists and turns I didn't want to put it down.Annabelle had such a life of running and running and always wondering why. She loved her father and trusted him no matter what. The ending left me with my mouth open. When that happens then I know I just finished a darn good book."
4,A worthy read.,"Unfortunately I started with Hide, so I am reading out of order. However, I am hooked! I will be reading all of the D.D. Warren books and look forward to more of her adventures."
3,Family secrets,"You can run, but you can't hide - at least not forever. That's what decorator Annabelle Granger learns when, after 25 years of changing homes and changing names, she returns to Massachusetts where all the madness began. It's obvious to Annabelle that her parents were protecting their family from something or someone, but never once did they reveal the reason why, and now both have died. Shortly after establishing herself in Boston, Annabelle reluctantly becomes involved in helping the police with a 20 year old serial killer case. The deeper they delve, the more danger she's in.Author Gardner manages to spring a few surprises in this thriller. Ultimately, the resolution owes more to luck (bad luck) than to solid evidence, but the ending is fairly satisfactory. Read this and you'll never view an abandoned mental institution in the same light again!"
3,"Great Beginning, Confounding Ending","This was my first Lisa Gardner book, and I read it quickly. It was fast paced, interesting--a real page turner. However, the ending made absolutely no sense. Another reviewer termed it perfectly: ""contrived."" It was as if the author had run out of steam and needed to finish the book, so she threw something out there. *SPOILER ALERT*--What frustrated me the most was how Annabelle's highly ""intelligent"" father, was unable to track down his brother after he shot him in the head. Also, it would seem that someone shot in the head would probably suffer brain damage, so why would ""Russell"" think that his brother was still a threat, and instead of running from ""Tommy,"" why not search for him?! But the most illogical ""surprise,"" was how ""Ben"" coincidentally found Annabelle and ""knew"" it was her. Non-sensical, I say! Other than the disappointing ending, this was a good read."
3,Loosely hung together.,"I enjoyed the book but found it implausible that instead of unfolding the truth with all the facts in place, new information was added when convenient to make the action plausible. That was the biggest let down. The new info wasn't added in a creative way that added to the storyline. New info was just thrown in toward the end - like an unstable uncle that we never heard of before."
4,"Exciting, haunting thriller","The author maintains her high level of twists and turns in her latest novel. Annabelle Granger remembers leaving home at age seven and moving to Florida with her parents using assumed names. She remembers similar escapes to Arizona, St. Louis, Virginia, and other places. Once her mother dies, Annabelle chooses their next place, Boston. Her father is dead within 18 months. 10 years later, still in Boston, Annabelle is single, lives with her dog; too paranoid to have other friends besides the UPS man. State Detective Bobby Dodge gets called on a gruesome case, the discovery of six dead girls on the grounds of what used to be the Boston Mental hospital. Many story threads tie into one as the task force tries to locate the killer. Overall this novel has all the right elements for a terrific novel to recommend. The one minor fault was the ending, which felt weaker than the rest of the story."
4,Good mystery,I thought the story line was great! It really kept my interest. I have to say I did like this a lot more than Alone.
4,Easy Read,"I grabbed this book one day while grocery shopping, having never heard of the author. Even though I saw this was part of a series, I decided to give it a try. Once I started reading, I was instantly pulled into the story. For the most part, I liked all the characters and I thought the way the author used the police department meetings to catch the reader up on what was going on in the case was clever. It saved the reader from having to read a lot of background story. My only semi-complaint was that I didn't think the budding romance between two of the characters was necessary. I also didn't think the story line about the character Catherine Gagnon added much, but decided this may have been a plot thread left over from a previous book. It took me one day to read this book, and all in all, it was a light, entertaining read."
4,Hide is a thriller,"I had not read any of Lisa Gardner before that I recall, She does a nice job of weaving sub plots into the main theme, and the summary of who-done-it was feasible and surprising - not the obvious."
3,A little redundant but otherwise great,"I really enjoyed this book. I did feel however that if you read the book in the series before it that we didn't need to constantly be reminded of the watercolor to get the connections. The ending also was a little obvious. I figured it out from the second encounter with him. Otherwise, Lisa Gardner's writing is,as always, wonderful and gripping."
2,And I was so pscyhed!,"Lisa Gardner set up a great premise and wheezed the book to an improbable end. There is enormous promise in the primary story: what would keep a family on the run for more than a decade? Yet I found the end contrived. Given that this is a suspense novel, I don't want to say much, but I will say I have enjoyed Gardner's other books more."
5,A Pleasure to Read!,Has all the components of a good read! Has well developed characters who have made mistakes in life as well as a mystifying plot. I especially liked how all the parts of the mystery fell into place. What are the odds of having 2 psychotic killers working independently to go after the victim! I think I will be more cautious regarding personal safety after reading this.
4,Good Follow Up To Alone,"As a follow up to Alone, this book does not disappoint. It picks up with now Detective Bobby Dodge, two years after the last book. In Alone, Bobby was a sniper and forced to use deadly force. This book continues with his feelings in the aftermath of that shooting in the background of his new job as a detective. His first case involves the discovery of 6 mummified bodies underground on the grounds of a former state mental hospital. This book has you guessing from the beginning and has many twists and turns. The whodunit and the ending to me seemed a bit contrived, but it was still good. Gardner doesn't miss when it comes to mystery and suspense!"
4,A surprising page turner.,"A surprising page turner. The ending was a little contrived, but definitely a worthy read, especially for the discounted kindle price."
4,A good pacy read,A great read from Lisa Gardner. Keeps the attention from the first with the discovery of a hoard of bodies of dead children from many years ago. With the strange tale of the heroine who has been brought up as a child being forced to run from place to place to escape what threat she did not know ahe is shocked to find her childhood best friend is amongst the corpses found. Could this have been her had the family not fled? Centering around parallel stries of the police investigation and the cenbtral characters own wish to find out the truth about her past suspense is maintained throughout with a little romantic relief built in as the protagnonist becomes involved with one of the team investigating the crimes. Some neat twists and a great denouement.
1,Deus Ex Machina novel,"Good novels give you clues that you usually miss anyway, but they were there all along. This novel gives no clues of any kind and at the end the murderer not only turns out to be somebody out of the blue, but could have been anybody else as well."
3,Come into Focus,"There is no way I'd give this book more than three stars. When compared to the pace and the adrenalin rush of LG's other four-to-five star books, this book was a struggle to read. I waited for well over six months for this book to come out (in hard back at that). Reading this in paperback would have been a struggle and far less expensive, but still a struggle. Other than Bobby, the other characters were just blah. I'll try her next book, but if it's not better than this, I'll have to hang up my LG books for a while."
4,Hide,This is a book writen a number of years ago but is part of the D.D. Warren series that Lisa Gardner is so famous for. As usual it's a bood that you don't want to put down. The plot is great and flows smoothly.
3,Better-than-average beach read,"This book gets three stars for being reasonably well written and suspenseful. As others have mentioned, though, the ending is ridiculous. The book helped me kill a few hours on a plane trip, which is pretty much all I asked of it. I would buy another book by this author for a quick vacation/plane read, since the quality of the writing was not as poor as you typically find with these types of books, and I found the characters reasonably interesting."
3,Just Okay,"I am a sporadic reader, so please keep this in mind as you read my review. This book kept my attention & interest, until it neared the end. It became annoyingly predictable, as though the writer was spent & looked for the easy way out, so she could begin her next book."
3,Ok story but...,Fun to read but..... The author chose to explain most of the story in the last fifty pages or so. I would have preferred to have those parts mixed into the story - like the fathers ex boss who seemed to know the entire mystery on his own when interviewed by the cops.
3,Best of Gershwin Review,I bought this CD because of the Porgy and Bess Medley which had such a good mix of the songs from Porgy and Bess. The rest of the album is fun if you're a Gershwin fan.
4,Vickie Winans lights up the room when she sings gospel.,"Ever since I caught a glimpse of her ""King Jesus"" gospel concert on TV last Christmas, I have been searching for the album. Her performance was electrifying and earth-moving.Thanks to ""Amazon.com"" I finally found this and many other CD listings I have been searching for all these months. God is great!"
5,MY GIRL IS THE BEST IN WHAT SHE DOES.,"MS. VICKIE WINANS DELIVERS THE GOSPEL LIKE NO OTHER CAN. SHE IS SO VIVACIOUS AND ENERGETIC ABOUT THE LORD. SHE IS TRUE AT HEART. ALL OF THE SONGS ARE SO ANNOINTED, BUT MY ULTIMATE FAVORITE IS SPIRIT OF THE LIVING GOD(FALL FRESH ON ME). I HAVE THE VIDEO AND CD. SHE TRULY GIVES A GREAT ANNOINTED PERFORMANCE. IF YOU NEED A BREATHROUGH, GET THIS ALBUM I GUARANTEE YOU WILL GET WHAT YOU NEED. VICKIE YOU INSPIRE ME TO PRESS ON. I AM WAITING FOR WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. GOD BLESS YOU. WITH LOVE AND RESPECT RICKY THOMPSON"
3,"I find the cd entertaining, but it's not her best work.","I am a true fan of Vickie Winans. I have seen her in numerous concerts and have purchased each of her projects. This newest project doesn't fall flat, but clearly isn't her best work. I love the single ""Already Been to the Water"" and the ""Old Gospel Medley"". I play them over and over again. Unfortunately, I feel that these singles carry the weight of the project. No doubt, it's entertaining; but I'm looking forward to another studio recording."
3,Worked as a starting point,"The maps were useful and plenty detailed, however not all of them were current or up to date. It served as a starting point, however, I still had to purchase more current versions of the areas I needed from BLM and USGS"
3,Baobab N'Wolof,"If you miss the sounds of the Theis markets, a neighborhood baptism or afternoons sipping tea with your Senegalese friends, this is the CD for you. It will take you back to the sights and sounds of Senegal. Filled with traditional Wolof music it is an excellent choice."
3,The Aussie Moist Shampoo did a great job ...,"The Aussie Moist Shampoo did a great job helping my dry hair. However, it also left my hair feeling somewhat weighed-down and a little bit sticky. The product smelled great, lathered really well, and relieved the frizz in my hair. Overall, I'd say it's an okay shampoo, which I might recommend to others with extremely dry or damaged hair, but maybe not with just slightly dry hair like mine."
4,"I should say it's really a big bottle, ...","I should say it's really a big bottle, and it saves time to combine shampoo and conditioner together. However, I don't like the smell too much -- I think it could be improved."
2,NOT THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought the Conair Professional Straightening Iron and let me tell you i was very disapointed. My hair is really thick and frizzy when i straightend it with the Conair Professional Straightening Iron it was semi straight but it made my hair very bushy!! It does straighten your hair if its not thick but i dont recommed it to people that have hair like me!!!!!!!!!
2,don't choose this one..,"so i have wavy, sort of thick hair, and i figured that a hair iron could handle it? i guess i was wrong...this iron doesn't get very hot and it ripped out my hair! it got caught in between the plasic part and the actuall straitening part. the comb is a good idea and actually worked pretty well, but it fell out so often that one day it became permently lost. it does heat up quickly, and does getthe base of your hair pretty smooth, but it NEVER worked to straighten my ends, they were always left wwavy."
2,A Definate Don't For Thick Hair,"This straightener is great for thin hair... but not for thick. I myself have very thick hair and this straightener usually leaves my hair looking frizzy and very poofy. The best hair straighteners out there are about 1"" thick or less and they normally have glass plates. So if you have thick hair, spend a little more money on something with a lot more quality."
2,Get more Pay less?,"I don't think so. I bought this straightner because I have some curls around my face that never go away, even when I blow-dry my hair stright. The iron took a long time to get hot and, there were no heat settings so, it was either much to hot so, it was burning my hair or not quite ready so I'd have to wait or go over the same spots many times. I have pretty much already stright, thin hair but, it didn't do well for me. I say, if you're going to spend the money, get something else."
2,This Iron Was Just Okay,"This iron is good if you have thinner hair and are just looking for a quick fix. But if you have thick hair like me, i suggest upgrading to a more expensive, top-quality flat iron that will last you a long time. If you do decide to get this one keep in mind that it is heavy- my arm got tired after about 5 minutes trying to straighten my hair. If your just looking to try out striaght hair on you, i reccomend this product because its a cheap way to see if you like striagt hair and if you like it you can buy a nicer flat iron. This iron definently won't get all of the kinks out very quickly, depending on your hair texture it could take up to an hour and a half to get it just the way you like it."
3,Its okay,This cost me $10 on sale at Rite Aid. I was kinda skeptical about buying it but I wasnt as disapointed as I thought. It's definatly not good for people with really thick curly hair..my hair isnt so bad so it straightened it pretty good. It's really cheap tho..theres no dials to adjust the heat controls..and its made of cheap plastic...all the other reviews are true...I would recommend the Revlon Hair Straightener..its about the same price but works a lot better..
2,Item was less than satisfying,"The only thing good about this item is that it is cheap. It was able to somewhat straighten my incredibly curly, thick hair but that was only after going over the same sections of hair numerous times. In the end my hair would still come out somewhat curled, frizzy and puffy. This straightener is somewhat heavy to hold and the plates do not get hot enough."
1,very bad,"The product arrived incomplete, does not come with Removable teethArrivals in a pink color, very ugly"
2,Item not as pictured,"Do not buy this item if you are expecting to receive the product as shown. It is no longer available, so they have substituted another model without pre-advising you. The one I received is made of cheap lightweight plastic and does not handle thick hair. That is why I was looking for the comb feature. I'm stuck with it now and won't be returning it because I'll be out even more shipping costs. I'll probably just donate it to a resale shop."
4,PRETTY OK PRODUCT,"THIS IS A OK PRODUCT. BUT IT COULD BE BETTER! I BROUGHT THIS ITEM AT WALMART FOR 13 DOLLARS BECAUSE I NEEDED A BIG STRAIGHTNER FOR MY HAIR. ALL MY OTHER ONES WERE TO SMALL SO I BOUGHT THIS ONE. IT'S OK BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE YOUR HAIR FEEL FLAT ALL THE WAY. I REALLY BOUGHT IT BECAUSE MY HAIR SWEATS ALOT,AND JUS INCASE WHEN I GET MY HAIR DONE I COULD MAKE IT FLAT WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS. BUT I GOT MY HAIR DONE AND USED IT AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS AND IT WAS NOT ALL RIGHT. I WAS MAD!!! I WAS GOING TO GET THE OTHER LARGE STRAIGHTNER BY CONAIR BUT THEY HAD SOLD OUT SO I SEEN THAT 1 AND GRAB IT B4 IT SOLD OUT COMPLETELY. DONT GET THIS PRODUCT SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET ANOTHER CONAIR STRAIGHTNER!!!!! BECAUSE NOW I HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER 1 AND WAIST TIME.MONEY.AND MORE SPACE AND I ALREADY HAVE 3 PRODUCTS-2 STRAIGHTNERS THAT ARE LITTLE AND A CURLING IRON THEY WORK EXCELLENT BUT JUS NEEDED A BIGGER 1."
3,Better Than You Think....,"WOAH! Sure this straightener looks like all the other crappy straightners in the world, but there's a twist to this one! It is my first straightner and I've had it for about 7 months. I bought it only because I was desperate for a CHEAP straightener because my hair is very thick, long, & wavy! I'm looking for a new straighner right now...but until then this one is doing just fine. If it works for me, it will work for you!"
3,its PRETTY good :),"this straightener works pretty good on my hair . i have thin/wavy/a little bit curly hair . it heats up in 4 minutes. it doesn't really work too good with humidity . like , if u just straightened your hair and u walk out the door in a very high humidity place .. your hair may get frizzy and a bit curly , but that only sometimes happens . if you want your hair to turn out straight i recommend u straightening your hair at night( wash hair before straightening ) , and the next day straighten your hair again ( without washing ). it turns out great for me ! so , over all this product works good on not too thick hair , not to curly hair , and not to wavy hair . .. this straightener works pretty good .. not the best , but not the worst : ) if your hair is similar , i recommend buying it !"
5,"LIGHTWEIGHT, LOUD, and...","...the color is super fun, too! My daughter is a lifeguard and asked for this whistle specifically. Buy the lanyard to complete the CUTE!"
3,Didn't Work Well For My Dog,"I will preface this review by saying that the product is well made and arrived quickly. I was happy with the price and think it is well worth the cost for the right dog. I personally had a few problems with the product. Number one it did not fit my girl Lili well because she has a hanging belly and that made the harness ride up so that it was mostly lifting her upper body. Also the handles were not long enough, my dog is a Beagle mix and her legs are short resulting in my having to lean over quite a bit to hoist her up. I wouldn't be able to go any distance with her in this harness as it would wear out my back. I would also like to suggest that you get yourself one of those snapping leather pieces that wrap around the 2 handles to hold them together, it makes it a little more comfortable.In the end I had to take 2 bath towels and sew them together into a large tube and that worked better for me in my situation and was more comfortable for her."
3,Wish It Worked...,"I bought this for my 14 year old border collie mix with severe arthritis in her right hip. Molly weighs about 60 pounds and we live in a raised ranch with two sets of stairs. Since Molly's problem is more centrally located in her rear, this harness does not work well for us. The only good thing it does is keep Molly from falling forward when we go down the the stairs. However, she just basically lets me carry her down and doesn't use her legs at all when I have the harness on her. It's of no use coming up the stairs because Molly's strength is in her front and she can pull herself up with no problem as long as you hoist up her rear for her.In addition, the strapping was hard to figure out at first and to get her in it is kind of a hassle. Most often, it's easier for me to just pick her up and carry her down but, I fear it's just a matter of time before I hurt my back or trip and fall. If anyone has an idea, please let me know!"
3,more complicated than necessary,"Not as easy and fast to figure out how to strap a dog into it as I would have imagined. Yes, there is an instruction (with drawings) but those many straps for front and back are just about always in the way. I feel there could be an easier and faster model out there..."
3,Wrong support,"I purchased this item with the intention of helping my dog up the stairs, but it did not work for her because she has a problem in the rear department not the chest area where this item works. I use a stretchy large rubber band from a exercise kit and it works well for her back end problem,but it is wearing out and I need to find another one. This product is good for dogs that need to be helped from the front end or chest area. It also did not fit her right. I even tried to reverse it and fit it on her backend, but it did not work. She can get her front legs up on the step, but needs help with her rear legs."
3,Old dogs sometimes need help,"I purchased this when my older dog suddenly had problems getting up. It was alot easier on her than the towel I was using, as she is a big dog. Getting her to wear it so I can just use it is another issue, but every dog is different."
3,Dog Sling,"Needed just a sling, so I rigged it to work, Now isn't great. Product doesn't need all of the strips on it."
2,"Either too big, or just doesn't help","Bought this for our 14 yr. old Lab with hip problems. Purchased a Large, because he weighs 82 lbs. Once on, I thought it was too big, and would have returned it except he got hair all over it by the time I got this on him! I did try hard to make it work, but it is so loose that it won't stay put if you let go of the handles. It just slumps down and he trips on it. It seemed to only lift right behind the front legs, and we need help with his back hips, getting up stairs, in/out of car etc. After looking at the photos above, it looks that way there, too, so maybe it's not the size, after all. I have found that on old bath towel, folded in half lengthwise, and slipped under his belly, but at his back end, works great.I use it to get him down the stairs, slip it off and we're good. Cheap, and washable. Wish I had my money back."
1,Difficult toUse,"We were unable to use this product with our dog. She had Degenerative Myelopathy, and her hind legs were becoming very unstable. The sling was very difficult to use and was frustrating for us and our dog. She weighed about 55 pounds. I had high hopes that the sling would help her walk without her falling over. When we tried the sling, I found out that I didn't have the strength to hold her up while we walked. After a very short time, my back and side were hurting, and she just sat down and refused to move. Perhaps a much stronger person would have more success with this product, although when my husband tried it, he complained about his back hurting as well."
3,Good idea...,"I would suggest a few minor improvements to make it 5 stars.Add thicker handles, rubber grips or even thicker fabric. Our 50lb Pit just had bilateral ACL knee surgery (rear legs) and lifting her with this sling was great but the straps dug into our hands and became uncomfortable after a short while.Re-enforce the connections between the strap handles and the sling body, after a few days of lifting Bella a small hole appeared.All in all decent product for the price"
1,Dog sling,I ordered the largest size dog sling and it did not fit my large dog. I was very disappointed. I did not try to return the item because it came in a sealed hard plastic packaging which I had to destroy to open. I had to open the product to try it on my dog. So now I have a useless sling. Although the product arrived in a very timely manner and it was as described just too small (even though the weights of dog and product matched!).
2,doggie harness review,"I am very grateful to have made the purchase on Amazon.com. Even more grateful that I did not pay full price for this item at Pet Smart. I have a black lab that is 10 years old and has a little trouble going up steps, I have a 3rd floor apt. It did not help out that much but thank you as always for providing your service."
2,My lab needs assistance with steps,We ordered this product after our 9 year old lab had knee surgery. We are still using it but find that it is difficult to adjust so that it fits properly. The picture of the golden retrieving wearing it makes it appear that it doesn't shift around during lifting...it does.We are now looking for a life vest that has handles. They seem to snug up to our labrador and zip up his back.I would not recommend the purchase of this product.
1,Not for hip dysplasia,"Our German Shepard is 100 lbs. this product claims to assist dogs up to 125, not so. The rear clips are poor quality and pop open, it lifts the front of the dog, not the rear, and keeps sliding forward..even with the straps snug. I can see where this would be great for a smaller dog, but for a big dog with hip dysplasia this is not what you want. My dog just cried when I tried using this! If you need something to lift a big dog, especially the hind legs, find something else."
4,A BIG help for us and for our labrador,"We had been looking for a way to make it easier and safer to help our 14 yr old lab into and out of the car and our tent trailer. We had gotten a pet ramp for him a couple of years ago which worked great for a while. Now that he has gotten older, that last step up was really difficult for him. We camped over Thanksgiving and this product worked as advertised...so much easier than picking him up! He had no problem adjusting to it and, as another reviewer said, learned very quickly to wait for us to grab the handles before attempting to go up or down."
2,lift,"Hi,I purchased this product to help us walk our injured dog.He is a big lab.It does not help.It may be ok for a smaller dog.It doesn't even help us lift him into the car.The lift slips and he doesn't have a secure hold.I wouldn't recommend this unless your dog is under 50lbs.It might help.ThanksA Dog Lover"
1,"Awful, awful book","This was quite possibly THE worst book I've ever read. [...] The author obviously does not have any understanding of other cultures or urban education. On her first day of teaching a class of first graders, she expects THEM to outline the ""rules"" of the classroom. [...] I came away from this book disgusted, disheartened and depressed. [...]"
1,yuck,normally Luanne Rice writes a fantastic novel. Could not get into this one. jumped around too much and story was very dry and hard to keep your focus on. will purchase other rice novels.
1,Yuck!,"I love Luanne Rice but not this first attempt of hers. If you like empty, sexual encounters this one is for you."
4,Wiring was the only issue,This item worked well for me. I've replaced a few power window motors before so it wasn't very difficult. I did have to drill out a couple of holes through the door panel to access bolts (2000 Ford Windstar). But on previous motors I've replaced the existing wiring just plugged in. This is the first one that I've done that required me to cut the connector off the existing wiring and then use crimp connectors to attach it. The other problem with this was their instructions say to match up the colors of the existing wires to the wires on the new motor. The wires on the new motor are red and yellow and the existing wires in the door are black and orange. I connected the red to black and yellow to orange and it seems to work fine.
5,Portable DVD Gift of Life,"I have been so pleasently surprised by this item. Not only is it beautiful, but it works so well. It was a gift for my father, who has to sit through 4 hours of dialysis 3 times a week. This DVD Player has made his treatments bearable.Thank you ever so much!"
3,Nice but battery does not last long,"Battery only lasted about 45 minutes the first time and second times I fully charged it. I read in the manual that at first you dont get the full 2 hrs advertised but it seems like 45 minutes is ridiculously low. Other than that, I like how it looks, how heavy it is and all the features. My only problem is how long it sustains a charge, not much by my initial estimations."
1,one star is to good for this one,"The main focus of this book is male arousal and quite frankly it is overdone and not believable. The plot is shallow, the characters undeveloped and I can't find anything to recommend the investment of your time to read this one. I picked this one up on Amazon for free and it still was't worth the price."
2,Connie.. come on!!,"I have read tons of books by Connie Mason, which i was really excited to get this one on my kindle. Boring!!I didn't even finish the book.. no wonder it was free. I was very disappointed."
4,The Last Rogue,"Once again, 's. Mason transports us into time with adventure and love of the heart. Wonderful story!!Can't wait to read more!"
1,Stupid book,"Seriously, this book should have been titled the rogue's arousal or some such. That's the one thing that was constantly mentioned throughout the book. I kid you not! I figured I should give it my one-star review anyway even though I really didn't want to waste my time reviewing it. I figured it would save some other poor soul the time they could spend reading something better.For a more detailed review on just how terrible this one is, please read Liz Baker ""book lover""s review. I agree with everything she said."
1,Waaaaay Too Easy,"One daughter and I played against the other daughter and her husband. We went first and completed the game on the first try. Then they took their turn and also completed the game. The questions are about the movie versions only, and none of us has seen the third movie yet, but the answers were obvious either from the books or from the way the questions were set up.If they ever come out with a Trivial Pursuit based on both the movies and the books--or on the books alone--with questions aimed at those who are very familiar with the material, I would buy it. This version is not something I would recommend for adults or for obsessive fans of any age."
3,Not for Tolkien fans,"This game is solely about the Movie trillogy. The questions are definatly ""trivial"" for anyone who has read the book more than once, the hardest questions for me where the ones that asked the actors names! Even though it is easy it still is fun & I am sure it will be played often in my home."
4,Better for Beginners,"The ""Lord of the Rings"" Trivial Pursuit game is a great way to have fun with the movies, especially if you aren't very familiar with them. However, there aren't many questions from the books; the focus of the game is entirely on the three movies. This means that if you're a bigger Tolkien buff, you won't be very challenged; I and my friends went through the whole game in an evening and knew almost every question. Overall, it's good for those who want a movie-oriented game, but if you know very much about Tolkien, you're wasting money buying this; you'll know it all already."
3,for movie fans only,"It was a fun-enough way to spend an evening, but since the questions were only movie-verse, anyone who has been a fan for more than the past 2 years would be disappointed. $35 was way too much to pay for something that does not bear playing repeatedly, and fans who cared about Tolkein before Orlando Bloom became Legolas (or in the case of many of us, was even born) will feel really cheated."
4,A Challenge,I have never really played this game but I love a real challenge. I like to test myself and see just how much I know about the subject. I also LOVE the lord of the rings. So if you LOVE the lord of the rings and would like to challenge yourself you should get this game.
5,Needs another box of questions!,The game is lots of fun but I was very disappointed that there was only one box of questions.
2,Waste of money,"Don't expect this to be a game about the books, it is strictly about the movies. And if you have seen the movies at least once, chances are you will be able to answer every single question without difficulty. There is no challenge and the questions are frequently silly. It also seems to only cover the the first 2 movies. If you are big on movie trivia, then maybe you will like this, but otherwise, beware. I loved the movies, but this is a bit much and a waste of money."
1,movies only?,"when i heard that there was a lord of the rings trivia game, i was pretty excited, but then i found out that it was only based on the movies. While i admit that the movies are indeed the only reason i read the books at all, i think that there is much much more challenging and fun trivia to be drawn from the books instead of the movies.make a book based lord of the rings game and i'll play it. but not if it's only movie based, since so much was changed and left out from the movies."
5,Great game but missing a piece and one is bent,This game was not in new condition- one piece was bent and one piece is missing. Still a fun game but we have to use pieces from our regular trivial pursuit to play.
3,cutting Cor Ten,This blade is probably good for cutting regular steel siding but when I used it on Cor Ten or Iron Ox steel siding it lasted an afternoon. I am now using the fiber blades at 2.99 each from Home Depot.
2,Not as good as advertised,"I bought this blade to cut holes in two metal doors for glass inserts. The first door went quick and easy. The second door was a different story. As soon as I started I could tell a difference in the cutting ability. The saw started to have trouble cutting, and I just did get the second door cut. The blade is totally useless after these two cut. If you need to do a small job then this saw is what you need but not very cost effective. From the other reviews I expected to get a lot better service but was disappointed."
2,Burn Baby Burn,"Using this saw on my 12"" Delta twin Laser for my rehab business, I have been dissapointed by it's tendancy to burn and/or its durability. While it is certainly possible that I or one of my crew cut something we shouldn't have this blade hasn't lasted as long as the two previous blades on my saw. Now when I try and cut anything wider than a 2x4 I get smoke, and If I am using the full crosscut capability we get so much that I need to open the windows.As I ususally don't need a real fine cut, next time I will get something more durable and with fewer teeth."
5,Pure Pop for Now & Then People,"The cover is a bit misleading on this one. Don't think you are going to get some sort of heavy metal. This is power pop all the way, with a healthy dose of the late sixties thrown in for good measure. Trying to pigeonhole this band would be difficult, but certainly the Beach Boys, Jayhawks, Elvis Costello, Beatles (of course), a dash of Utopia, and a pinch of Teenage Fanclub. Certainly the harmonies are one of the drawing cards of this record, not to mention the endless supply of juicy pop hooks (just check out the riff on Saturday Girl to see what I mean). This one is for fans of the music that SHOULD be getting played on the radio but isn't."
5,Great Laminate Miter Saw Blade,"I purchased this fine-cut blade for my Bosch Glide miter saw prior to laying about 900 sq ft of laminate flooring that has an integral aluminum oxide containing finish on it for extra wear-resistance. One of the installer complaints about this type of flooring is the ""toughness"" of cutting it and the importance of having a chip-free accurate cut to allow the floor to look well-installed. The blade has performed extremely well providing smooth chip-free cuts and despite some sparking, the aluminum oxide finish hasn't slowed it down at all. It's also clear that the noise dampening laser cuts on the blade work well because there's no screeching when making the cuts through such hard materials."
4,Great for fine work,"A little pricy, used it for cutting aluminum screen angles for my porch, if you need precision cuts, this is the ticket"
5,Good deal.,"I cut aluminum all day, every day. Schedule 40 pipe from 3/4""-4"" and 1/4"" - 1/2"" flat bar. This blade cuts sweet and all I put on it is Lever bar soap for lubricant. As with any aluminum cutting carbide blade, do not force the cut like you are cutting interior wood trim and it should last a long time."
4,Clean cuts in AL extrusion,This did a great job with my DeWalt mitre saw in cutting heavy AL extrusion to install a Shower door. Very satisfied.
5,Freud Diablo RULES,"I have used the 10"" Diable combo blade in my table saw now for many years. Freud Diable is the only blade I will buy. This 12"" blade, in my opinion, comes very close to the Forrest blade cut but at half the price. I use this on hardwood crosscuts in my DeWalt sliding miter with great results."
2,No Subtitles or dubbing,This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This looks like it might bea really good film. The problem I have with it is that the VOD rental is in Spanishwithout subtitles or dubbing into English. I think Amazon could be more clear explainingthis before you rent the film. I think Victoria Abril is a wonderful actress and I waslooking forward to watching her in this movie. I will look for the film on DVD if Ican find it.
5,"We saw, we bought, we played","Lot's of small pieces to keep up with, but for a child that's old enough and for those of us adults who lack patience for formal war games, it's an excellent choice. It seems to be a combination of Chess, and Battleship. There's plenty of room for adaptions, rule hacks, etc... (which my daughter and I promptly did on our 3rd game) especially, when combined with the other two games of this series. WORLD AT WAR!!!!! Jets vs. Tanks!!!! Shore Bombardment!!!!!Still, the small, loosable pieces definitely mean you'll need to make sure your kids don't run off with 'em, or worse the dog doesn't swallow one."
3,Good book-length synthesis,"""Touched by War"" is a reasonably good military history of the fighting in SW La in 1862 and 1862 (after the fall of New Orleans). The maps and level of tactical detail are very revealing. Although the research level is adequate, a more rigorous search of manuscript depositories and other available primary source material would have enhanced this book immensely. I would give it 3.5/5 stars. Note that Pena's more recent book ""Scarred by War"" is a revised edition of this book that also includes new chapters covering activities in the final two years of the war."
2,Windscreen,The wind screen collapses at speed or in high cross winds. Prior models were better engineered and were more functional.
3,just ok,"The color is darker then it looks in the picture, and there is a gap on the side that is very noticable in person that makes it look cheap. It is decent for the price and holds a lot of stuff."
1,Tricky,From this picture I thought it was bigger and taller but when I got this package it made it look smaller and shorter now I haveto buy another one because I collect ALOT of DVD's and CD's. So I recently bought a jumbo round and I loved it and much better than this one so I sold it to someone else. I dont miss this item!!!
3,poor instructions,"Shelving had some damages probably due to poor packing, during shippingAssembly instructions probably better if I could read Chinese, some shelves were assembled upside-down due to vague instructionsFor the price, the value was acceptable, but I would not purchase this again.you get what you pay for (almost)"
1,Terrible,Who ever wrote the arrangments for this CD has never been to Hawai'i. I suspect the person looked at a map or globe while writting the arrangments. Who ever produced the CD saw how bad the arrangments were and gave the music to his children to play ... at least they had almost mastered Chop Sticks. This CD was a total waste of money.I will pay to ship you my copy.
3,"Sequal to ""The Peter Pan Syndrome""","Many women who have read ""The Peter Pan Syndrome"" by Dr. Dan Kiley were left wondering how they could start to improve their own situation in the relationship. Dr. Kiley attempted to answer these questions with this book. Although mostly a series of case studies it did have some good points. Chapters included potential victims, falling in the Wendy trap, denial and effects, hitting bottom, and how to resolve the Wendy Dilemma by becomming a Tinkerbell. I strongly recommend reading this book after the ""Peter Pan Syndrome"" or you will be confused with some of his references.The last chapter on transitioning to a Tinkerbell was the most enlightening for me; it was one thing that the first book did not cover in enough detail."
3,Nice book but...,"I am beginner in model railroading, and I learnd a lot from this book. However, I noticed one thing in the book , he prefers Woodland Scenics , expensive track systems. Scratch building is completely forgotten.I don't have big budget for my hobby (VERY LOW) and I will have to buy another book beacuse this one is for people with big money in the pocket."
5,Outstanding book for all ages!,"I first read the book ""Alice"" when I was about 13 or 14. It remains one of my favorite books of all time. The expression of unconditional love that is shown is something everyone could be reminded of now and again. I hope to read it to my children someday."
3,Try exposing kids to the original Beach Boys recordings,"This is a fine CD, but the Beach Boys' voices were so angelic to begin with, that the original recordings are quite listenable for kids. My 3-year old loves the Beach Boys. Given that most of the original Beach Boys' recordings consisted of sophisticated vocal and musical arrangements (how many pop songs do you know that regularly include French horns, kettle drums, sleigh bells, banjo, and FIVE-part vocal harmonies?), you probably can't go wrong playing the original songs."
2,Wipe Out!!,An extra star just for the effort. Do yourself a favor and listen to the song samples first and then ask yourself if you want to hear this for several hours a day if your child actually likes it.
1,Awful,"This cd is horrible (i mean horrible). the beach boys voices are so much better than this and don't deserve to be butched up. the falsetto voice isn't falsetto, and have they ever heard of a bass voice? their voices are whiny and i'd recommend about 10 years of voice lessons before they ever try and sing again.sincerly hope they sing better next time,a very aggrivated kid"
4,Southern gothic meets film noir,"Dallas is at the top of her game with this novel. The suspense she creates is superb, and this book makes for delicious reading. In a break from her previous novels, she's moved this tale out of the 19th century, but the past can't be forgotten in this tale of a Southern family and the remnants of a society still clinging to the values found in the Old South. This one successfully made its way around my circle of reading friends."
3,New Mercies,"This book is s-l-o-w to get started. Ms. Dallas has done a fine job researching the Netches, Mississippi and 'southern' life style. Unfortunately, the story is as slow as the life style it represents."
5,Great Read!,"This was our local book club selection and I was sure I would hate it, because I dont' like murder mysteries. ut teh murder was sort of a side story in this very well written book."
5,Another Sandra Dallas Hit,"Once again Ms Dallas has provided us with an insight into the every day lives and the life style of the folks from the era. In the tradition of Persian Pickle Club,The Chili Queen and The Diary of Mattie Spenser we have the weave of characters and history. Ms Dallas is also proof that a story can be well told without being offensive to anyone. Highly recommended!!"
1,Extremely Muffled Sound,"I am only going to speak on the transfers used for this CD, as others have discussed the merits of the performances. The transfer engineer ,Stuart Rosenthal, has tried too hard to make these performances soundlike they were recorded in modern times. As the title of the CD says, these are the pre-war recordings of Hess's Schumann. Therefore, they should sound old, shellac hiss and all. Without it, you have a muffled, unmusical sound that sounds like the piano is in the next room. Usually Naxos Historical is superb (when Marston or Obert-Thorn does the transfers), but in this case I have to say pass. You can get a much better transfer of her Carnaval in her Great Pianist's of the Twentieth Century 2CD set. It also has a later recording of her Schumann Piano Concerto, so you'll only be missing one work from this abominable CD."
5,easy reader book,This was the third book that I purchased for the two older grand daughters. They loved the series. They are easy reading books.
1,Tasteless,"This has to be one of the worst songs i have ever heard in my life.The production is weak and these girls cannot sing at all.I recieved it through a record pool (which I will not name because i am an influential disc jockey at a key station)needless to say i will be sending this back to the pool that sent it to me.Overall, its trash sorry to say but i need to tell the truth and represent the best music around the world."
4,Nice cup of cappuccino,"These T-Discs make a good cup of cappuccino, close to coffee house quality for much less cost. The discs are easy to use, and your cappuccino is ready in about 2 minutes. They are also very easy to clean up, just throw away the discs when you are done."
2,"I hate to disagree, but","I found to be the cappuccino discs to be a huge disappointment. I bought the Tassimo system because I was so excited about easy cappuccino at home, and excited about not spending so much on it on a daily basis in coffee shops in NYC - but the taste just didn't sit well with me. Maybe there was something wrong with the milk discs I got, but the drink ended up tasting a lot like condensed milk - with this strange sweet flavor - that was not good - and not normal for a cappucino. I would reccomend the Mastro Lorenzo Crema instead, by far..."
1,?,Who would put together such a inconcise compilation? Surely the Geils band didn't approve of this!
3,Bible Guide,I had started using an old copy of this book and unfortunately left it behind when visiting relatives in another state. The price on this was much cheaper than having my relatives mail the original. It is helpful but not great in guiding me through the Bible.
3,"Yes, something's missing","I agree with Vickie from Clarksville. No Honolulu City Lights, so how can you call it Best of the Beamers. (Okay, some editor/compiler doesn't count HCL as one of the best, I guess.)I didn't buy this CD, because of that and some other missing songs. Maybe someday when I have all the other songs I want, then I will buy the one called ""The Best."""
3,Tarzan and the Lost World,"The author's literary style is well developed and he set up and interesting story line in which for the first time Tarzan is lost. An American name Jason Gridley is set on rescuing David Innes from a lost world that lies under ours. A world with its own sun that never sets and the author can play with his ideas of evolution with the introduction of the snake people. And as in other ""Lost Worlds"" we have read about Tarzan has to fight prehistoric animals that the author claims are the ancestors to the creatures of Tarzan's jungle up above. With what seems like an entire world bent on the destruction of this intruder, Tarzan must persevere if he is to be successful in his rescue."
4,Great variety of songs. Great musicians,"Great stuff. Gabby, Atta Isaacs, two of Gabby's sons, Sonny Chillingsworth and other musicians combine for fine group sounds and beautiful music centered around slack key guitar. Joyful songs. Some traditional and somber. Lived up to expectations."
5,Great buy!!,"This book is a wonderful addition to anyone who has a library of young chidlren's books. It is written in both English and Spanish, and is a favorite of all young children. The text is simple and effective in teaching concepts of print to young children.The colors of each train car are vivid and eye-catching. The Spanish text is also simple and allows children to explore another language with a familiar story. A must-have!"
3,Leap Pad Arthur book,"My 6 1/2 year old daughter loves Leap Pad - but be aware that when you jump to the blue level, the entire pages are no longer read aloud (which was quite a disappointment to her). The pen will read the words 1 by 1, but not the whole page. The pages are fairly long and filled with text, yet the questions are almost too easy. Early readers may tire ofr reading independently. It would have been nice if the Leap Pad could have read the pages. There are limited activities compared to the orange (lower) level."
5,REALLY GOOD BUY!!!!!!,"I Can Speak German is a steal at $... If you want a really good beginner program this is the best deal out there. You get 15 lessons, grammar turtorial, alphabet reference, and a good flash card practice program which all play a crucial role in starting to help you grasp the language. This software is an excellent start for building vocabulary, basic grammar knowledge, working on pronunciation and is just a great start in general. I enjoyed this program so much that I am considering buying German Now which is another program by the same company, Transparent Language. For its price and content this program is a great buy and should get a 5 star rating."
1,Horrible Program,"Do not buy this product, i urge you! Trust me this product is hard to actually use and i am very educated in computers. I should have listened to some of the other reviews, this one is definatly horrible. Not much on it and the German before you know it, program is missing a file to run it. Please save yourself the head ache and dont buy this."
4,Good game for the money,"I think this game was worth the money, we play it a lot at my house and we are big board game players. It is NOTHING LIKE THE ORGINAL CLUE GAME, so if that's what you are looking for, look elsewhere. I would like to see more then 4 people be able to play. And you can p;ay with 2 people, but It's not very fun because you end up following each other around the board asking each other questions. That gets dull, the more people the better."
3,okay..............,"Pretty fun to play and the sound effects are pretty cool, the only problem is that it sometimes takes a little while for the game board to recegnize the pieces. still pretty fun though"
2,Why?,"High Plains Drifter is a great movie - 4 or 5 stars all the way. I already have a DVD copy. Why would I purchase another? As this is Universal's 100th anniversary, one would think the studio would have gone all out for a blu ray version.Thus 2 stars for impudence!"
4,Classic Eastwood,"This is a classic Eastwood film. If you're a fan of others such as Hang 'Em High, or the Man with No Name trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, The Good The Bad and The Ugly), then this is a good one for you."
5,They'll never forget the day this Stranger came to down.,"Clint stars and directs in this sinister story about a mysreious stranger who rides into a frontier town and is hired to protect the town from three men who are getting released from jail, but the town's folk soon realise that they need protection from the stranger who seems to have a grudge against the town. Strong performances from all involved especially Clint."
3,Disappointing DVD,"This classic western deserves better than the studio gave. The digital transfer is very disappointing. There are dust, sploches and other artifacts that should have been ""cleaned up"" before releasing this DVD.The film itself is enjoyable as ever, but the poor quality of the transfer is distracting. The studio should redo this.Edit: If you have any doubts about the quality of the transfer watch the restored version of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. There is no comparison.The Good, the Bad & the Ugly (Extended Version Collector's Set) (1967)"
3,very disappointing,"this movie was the same as the version I purchased some 10 years ago. You would think for a company's ""centennial"" edition of a very fine movie they would at least have made the widescreec anamorphic to fill the screen. As it is all they did was add a digital copy but other than that it is the same thing - quite a disappointment."
5,the dvd enhances the direction of photography,"i had never seen this film in widescreen format. my vhs copy was never formatted to fit the screen. now that i own the dvd, i am amazed how beautifully shot this film is, from the opening frame of the ""no name"" gunman appearing from nowhere in the desert heat to the very end, the movie becomes a vision of light and darkness. this film is a western but the story line stands above any western i have seen. it is about revenge. anyone that i have recommend this movie to are impressed because they don't feel it is really a western but film noir. i totally agree."
4,High Plains Drifter,"My husband really likes it. I personally, dislike all of Eastwood's ""spaghetti westerns"", and this was very little different, only with a ghost story thrown in."
5,"""i never got your name."" ""i never gave it""","with those lines ""stranger"" settles the name game quickly. this is clint's second movie as director and his first try at a western. once again he shows he is equal to the task.a stranger rides out of the desert into the town of lago and in less than 5 mins. is attacked and kills 3 men.after that the townspeople ask him to protect them from outlaws getting out of jail and coming to the town for revenge.how he protects the town and who he is (or was) makes for a very sharp western myth at its best.no real extras(trailer and production notes), but film looks good,clear good sound,and even gives you both widescreen and pan and scan! very good disc"
3,Stick to Sergio,"This was one of Clint's earlier American westerns and was a pretty big dissapointment (to me anyway). I'm a huge fan of ""The Man with No Name"" trilogy of spaghetti westerns, but this one just didn't live up to their predecessors. What made Sergio Lione's westerns so good was their sense of adventure as well as how much fun they were. In Fistfull, For a Few Dollars More, and TGTBATU Clint is constantly spouting funny and bad-ass one liners, and the other characters are colorful and cool as well (Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes/ Douglas Mortimer, Eli Wallach as Tuco.) Clint, as always, is a great western actor, but the sense of fun is gone and the movie is boring and too dark, the climax is cool, but the annoying midget and the supernatural theme keep this from being a Clint classic. Instead try Outlaw Josey Wales, Pale Rider, Unforgiver, ""Man With No Name"" series, and the BEST western ever, Once Upon A Time In The West"
1,What's up with the truncated run time???,"The out of print version of this DVD is 106 minutes, IMDB has a run time for High PLains Drifter as 105 minutes. The only available version is much shorter. Can someone comment on this, as there is no way I would ever buy a shorter version of a film, and no one else would either."
3,Eastwood so so,"I really enjoy the westerns and Clint Eastwood, but with all honesty fid many of the above reviews a little exagerrated. Thisi movie is no math for the trilogy or another classic western Once upon a time in the west. if you want a true western, skip this one, and start with the GBU and the rest of sergio leone flicks"
2,To much Clint!!,"Most Clint Eastwood movies are great but this one is just too Clint for even Clint to pull off he tries to hard to be really badass and comes off just being a jerk, the plot lacks and they kept showing the same stupid flashback over and over it was about ten minuts long and they showed it over and over, slowing down the movie to the point where most of the people with me did not even finsh it. However there is a migget side kick so if your into that then this movie will probably be great."
2,Overrated Clint vehicle not deserving of its reputation...,"I'd read for years about how good this western is, but still put off seeing it. I'm glad I did though. I've seen it twice in the last 3 years, and it just gets duller and dumber. The supernatural angle? Painting the town red? Shades of Sergio Leone? None of this impressed me. Don't get me wrong, I love Clint. But, certain movies of his are just plain overrated. 'Unforgiven' is the same way. I agree with the reviewer who said to stick with the spaghetti westerns. They're much more entertaining and original, not to mention deserving of their reputation(s)."
1,A NO BRAINER,"This movie (shown on TV recently) is without a doubt the most stupid, inane movie I have ever seen. I only watched it thru to the end as I wanted to find out what was going on............didn't work as I still don't understand what it was all about. Why the red buildings? Why the picnic tables? and on and on and on!!!!"
4,Love it,Watched it today and it was great and will watch it again and again and maybe even again and again loved it.
1,Not as advertised,"This review is for Amazon.com, not the movie itself. I bought this dvd because the description said it was released in February 2009. This was not the case. This is the 1998 version. The aspect is 2.35:1, but it is not anamorphic. Played on my widescreen tv, the image was stretched out, so I had to use the fill screen mode, which cuts out some of the picture at the top and bottom. The sound was dolby 2.0 mono. The movie itself is great and I would give it 4 stars. I was only hoping for a remastered version with better sound and picture. Amazon needs to remove this listing if this version doesn't exist."
2,Could have been better.,Net is low quality thin nylon and will probably wear quickly and will have to be replaced within the year. Light ring band around center is a cool idea but does not work at all with any daylight. Barely visible at dusk you will have to wait for night to actually have any use for it. Could have used bright LED for daytime use and would have rated higher.
1,Light??,"Our net does not light up, hopefully a new battery will fix the problem...however that requires the time to take down the net and reinstall. Very disappointed that it was not functional from the onset."
5,Good Net,"It's good for the night time and day time. The battery life is pretty long. It's good even when it rains, hails, and other weather. Love playing basketball!"
3,I like it,It came exactly as advertised. But the package was all bent up from poor packaging. I haven't used it yet though.
2,very cheap and doesn't seem to work,cheap product that does not appear to work at all. I was not aware that the only time it lit up was when shots are made and that doesn't even seem to be the case.
5,Awesome accessory to go with our LED basketball,"Our night basketball just got a lot funner with this net. This item works perfectly. The auto-start feature is nice, so no one has to get up on a ladder when we start playing night basketball. The sensor seems to work perfectly, causing the lights to flash for five seconds every time someone makes a basket."
2,Not bad,"This product is a good idea, just poorly executed. The batteries run out way too fast. Also, the net isn't actually illuminated, just a ring about halfway up the cylinder is. It goes off if nothing jostles it after a few seconds and you're back in the dark til you can sink one blind. On the ""brighter"" side, I can now shoot almost flawlessly in nearly no light! Too bad the light up all those NBA arenas!"
5,Perfect,Easy installation and easy programming. Did it in about 5 min and has worked ever since. Its nice that if the door is open you just have to hit enter in order to close it.
5,GREAT,The package came quickly and as described. It was a great price and It was easy to setup and install. I recommend it!
5,Wireless Keypad Opener,The opener is a snap to program and install. The price was much less than I could buy it from Sears or a hardware store.
5,A must have.,"I bought this to install on the outside of the garage for convenience knowing at some point I will be standing in front of a closed door carrying something and wishing I don't have to go through the house to open the garage door or go in to one of the cars to hit the button. No wires, easy to install. Neutral color works fine with the siding and doesn't draw attention to people walking past. Light keypad will be nice."
4,Exactly as promised,This keyless entry for my garage door works exactly as promised. It took me longer to screw the item to the wall than it did to program my garage door opener for this unit. Just make sure that you have the right keyless entry for your opener. This one works only on units with a purple programming button.
5,just as advertised,"Came quickly. Was a piece of cake to program and install. Works like a charm. FYI - you do need to have the purple ""learn"" button on your opener for this to work."
5,Great Remote,"This is a great addition to your garage door. It allows a temporary code as well so you can set it for repair people or if you just want someone to get in for one time. Easy to install, simple to program (just push a button on the opener & then one on the device & you are done - almost too easy). Great alternative to having multiple keys to your home floating around too!"
5,Great Buy,Item description was so helpful in selecting which would work with my opener without spending more then I had to.
1,Does not work at all..,"I bought these product 3 days ago for my Chamberlain Liftmaster garage opener, it arrive fast that's good. As soon as arrived, I opened right away and tried to program it. I followed the instruction and unfurtunately this keypad do nothing... I am disappointed. I will request for refund right now........!!"
4,A Fine Collection,"Elizabeth Gilbert is a talented writer and some of these stories in this collection are absolutely terrific. These stories will capture your imagination. There were several that I wished Gilbert would have made into novels. I really enjoyed reading these stories, but I did read Stern Men, her novel, first and as strong as these stories are, Stern Men is even stronger, so I was a little disappointed. All in all, however, this is a terrific collection by a very talented writer and I look forward to seeing more of her work."
4,O.K.,"I really enjoyed Gilbert's books Eat, Pray, Love and Committed but this book is a little boring. I really just don't enjoy fiction. She is very talented and I wish she would write more non-fiction."
2,Disappointing purchase,"I loved Elizabeth Gilbert's, ""Eat, Pray, Love"" so when I purchased my new Kindle and was looking for some short stories to transition to this new way of reading, this seemed to be an excellent choice. I was totally disappointed in the book; not one of the stories was what I would have expected after reading ""Eat, Pray, Love."" I am sorry I spent the money."
2,Pilgrims,"I expected more. I love Elizabeth Gilbert's Eat, Pray, Love and I thought I would enjoy this one, but I was wrong. Her short stories went nowhere and had no real significance to them. The characters really didn't leave an lasting impression on me either. I was dissapointed with this book, however, I would still be interested to see what Gilbert puts out in the future."
2,Pilgrims,"This is an incredibly well written book, and Elizabeth Gilbert is my new hero. However, I like her other books much better. Eat, Love Pray is fabulous."
1,Pilgrims by Elizabeth Gilbert,The Cd's were scratched upon opening the box it makes it kind of hard to follow a book when it skips off an on through out the book.
2,Not as well researched as I expected,"This book contains many common sense suggestions for improving our schools; however, his figures for Catholic school spending are off. The notes show he did just very cursory research on the subject. This makes me leery of the whole book."
1,Bureaucracy Bad! School-Based Decisionmaking Good!,"Like many books in this field, things that should be considered obvious are presented like the author has discovered the mystery of the atom. Ouchi appropriately takes potshots at top-heavy school systems. He makes the case for school independence in direction and budgeting. All perfectly reasonable. Ouchi provides examples of schools that work because they went their own way, made their own choices. Unfortunately, the book is altogether too heavy handed. In the model schools, no one ever teaches a bad lesson and every child is smiling, while test scores ""rocket"" upwards. It is too much. One of his main case studies is Houston. Too bad it was revealed after publication that there was systematic lying going on in that system about graduation rates and who knows what else. (See Washington Post 11/8/2003 article by Michael Dobbs)."
2,I agree with the reviewer's comments above,The reviewer above accurately sums up the craziness of the so call continuity links between the stories. There is less nudity than in Bloodlust but the same cheapness about the segments. The zombies are done to death (figuratively speaking!) and so are comical rather than scary. The reason I am giving this two stars is only for one segment with the videotape showing the immediate future of it's victims. I think it particularly cranked up the atmosphere nicely when the husband is watching his room on the tele and then switches neatly to his own room before his vengeful zombie wife comes for him!!
4,under-known verdi,"too bad that there is so little on record (studio recordings or otherwise) of verdi's visceral, formative, and in fact definitive early operas. there is so much in battaglia that resonates in the verdi lover's ear and consciousness, and this is one of those performances---far from perfect in many ways---that makes one yearn for the voices and tempi of the not-so-yesteryear. i honed my opera teeth during the period that this recording was made, but alas---except for a few too, too pricy Cetra imports, the music was not available readily to the neophyte except in piano scores----and i had no musical training, much less a piano. so, thanks that his performance is again available, in interpretation by some of the greats of the post-war period."
2,Naxos versus Chandos,I am a big fan of Naxos recordings having over 100 in my collection but I Think they miss the boat here. The Chandos set with The RSNO and Thomson offer a better alternative and not much difference in price.
4,Reel and Real Sweethearts Forever,"Sweeping lyrical scores, brilliant technicolor and staccato pace set the backdrop for this love story between wife Gwen (Jeanette) and husband Ernest Lane(Nelson). As wildly popular stage performers, they live a perpetual honeymoon, on stage and off - a touch syrupy for some but delightful for romantics. That the movie lacks a story line is unimportant - the scores and lavish productions more than compensate in this opulent Victor Herbert musical. Outstanding is the couple's poignantly rendered harmony with ""My Little Grey Home of the West"". In that sequence, Nelson Eddy vividly projects a fiery affinity for Jeanette MacDonald that is actually palpable. The movie is well named."
4,"Sweethearts forever, MacDonald/Eddy.......","Sweeping lyrical scores, brilliant technicolor and staccato pace set the backdrop for this love story between wife Gwen(Jeanette) and husband Ernest Lane(Nelson).

This movie is well named."
3,But What About a Story Line?,"This is a beautiful movie. In technicolor. The costumes are incredible. The sets are lavish. The music is wonderful. But where is the story? Broadway man and wife split up. Man and wife get back together. And That's It, Folks (as Porky Pig says). Nevertheless, this movie is pure entertainment. Watch this film and enjoy. And you will enjoy. Just don't expect a wonderful screenplay. Just enjoy the wonderful music, sets, and costumes. Thank You."
3,in color.....oh my......MGM finally spent a little money..,"Now that ive seen this movie in color, im glad Louis b Mayer was cheap andmade all the previous Jeanette and Nelson movie in black and white.Maybe one day they will be collorized and i will get both versions.Sweethearts plays almost like the real life of this couple. Hounded downall the times to perform, and the plots taken by their management to keepthem.With color we now see Jeanette and Nelson in a different atmostphere.We see more of the makup, and more things jump out because of the color.Im so used to see them in different era costumes, that seeing themas normal was kind of a shock.Sooooo the movie sweathearts is good,,,but not as good as their othermovies together."
1,Radiation Hormesis - a one sided view,"I was very disappointed in this unbalanced view the author presented. It fails to present supporting information that refutes the concept of radiation hormesis. Many of the examples presented as hormesis are actually stress induced changes that may reduce the overall fitness of the organism. For example, the ecologic radon studies of Bernard Cohen which are stated to support hormesis have been shown by Drs. R. William Field and Jay Lubin to be without merit. However, I did find some of the writing heuristic."
2,run very small,"i am normally a 36. had to return that for a 38, and they are tight. dont really care for the 38 fit, but dont want to bother sending them back. so the sizing is way off!!!!!!!!!"
1,Bad!!,"I bought this about a year ago.. and let me tell you, I was very dissapointed! when I got it, I was well excited it was only $9.99 at Canadian Superstore.. so I'm like why not.. it was half price or something. When I got home, I was excited When I opened it and put it all together and tried it, IT DIDN'T EVEN WORK.. my mom tried to help me. We were there for about two hours.. seriously trying to figure out this thing.. I never did :( I never got to try it.. and well I returned it and got my money back, but I wish I had gotten it to work.. to see how it actually looked but I didn't.. I don't recommend this product but other people have had positive reviews.. so if you shall do it.. TAKE YOUR OWN RISK :)"
2,be wary...,"I am a proffessional hair wrapper, among other things, and I would be wary of this product. I have seem many people who have tried to use this product at home, and many have come to me to get their hair wrapped properly. This product, while very cost effective (compared to approx. $15-30 for each professional wrap), they are hard to use and often create uneven, messy wraps which do not look the same as the real thing. I have heard stories about people's hair getting caught in the device. I do not wish to bash this product, I just want people to beware that they do indeed get what they pay for and there is definitely a learning curve to be able to make good looking wraps with this product--dont' expect perfect results the first few times you use it."
5,Awesome Find!,"I bought this to use for an animation lesson with my classroom. I was really excited to find it. I got it for a super cheap price. It is small, and a little dinky, but hey, you get what you paid for!"
1,Treo 750 problmes w/ Windows,"WINDOWS Mobile 6 Professional running on ATT. GUI look/feel fine, ergonomics fine (read all the positive reviews), but phone has problems w/ autosync, email not updating, freezes. Battery life very poor. I'm an occasional user, mostly use phone commuting to/from work. I'm very unhappy with having to reboot the phone multiple times a day. Upgraded o/s from 5 to 6 with little or no improvement in freezes. I'll wear out the door to the reset button. Fortunately a company phone, so IT will get me a new one to try. Curious to see if a second phone will still encounter all of the o/s issues. Would like to try Palm o/s but that isn't a choice with IT."
3,a little disappointed.,"I purchased the phone because i was going to be traveling oversea. I discovered that I could not use a calling card with the phone. it just did not work. I guess I thought this phone was wifi, my missunderstanding.so it wasn't very use full. I had to internet cafe all over asia. One of the main reasons i purchased the phone so I would not have to do this."
3,Don't plan to keep your current number,"I was ordering a Treo 750 online via Amazone a few nights ago, got to practically the final screen to okay the purchase. I suddenly realized I had not ever been asked what my current mobile number is. Backed up, started to try to figure this out: online info for Amazone explains that Cingular currently ""not capable of porting"" one's current number to a newly purchased phone. That is if you order through them, just be ready to start using a new number. I decided to wait and not order just yet."
3,Activation Problems- Beware,"I received this phone yesterday. I purchased a new line of service, with a new phone number. The instructions for activation say to pop in the SIM card and battery and within 15 minutes you'll receive a text message with your new wireless number that will be used to activate the phone. It's 32 hours later and I've yet to receive the message. So I have the phone but no wireless activities available to me whatsoever."
1,FEDEX is Terrible,I ordered this phone on 3/28/07. It shipped via FEDEX on 3/29/07 to my office with an indicated delivery of 3/2/07. The package sat on the FEDEX truck for three days before they attempted to deliver it at 8pm to an adjacent business and then left it without the package being signed for. This was after I'd already called FEDEX to refuse delivery of the package because it was too late in arriving. FEDEX's response for it sitting three days on the delivery truck was that the driver was overloaded. For the $100 difference in price it was less hassle to just go to the local Cingular store.
5,Great phone and great price buying it with Amazon,"I work for an University and my contract was due 2 months ago. I decided to get this phone because my PDA was already old and I needed something that would be efficient. I got this smartphone almost 2 months ago and I just have good things to say about it. First, it is not as heavy as the last model (650) and also looks really cool. Second, the interface is pretty easy to use and figure it out. The phone is Microsoft OS based (I used a palm device before) so getting use to it took me a couple of days but not really a big issue. The battery works really well and, in spite of other reviews, the life have been pretty great, even when compared with my last phone (a motorola).In general, I thinks is a pretty good buy and you cannot beat the price when Cingular sells it for way more money than Amazon. I'll definetively will buy from this website again."
2,"Bad, slow and weird","Pros:1. Its a PDA Phone2. Touch Screen3. Windows OS (this should be under Cons actually)Cons:1. Horrible battery life, comes only for a day.2. Very slow response, when try to answer pressing the answer button during incomming calls, it would take some times up to 2 more rings before it responds.3. Voice clarity is below average.4. tons of random applications will open up with out your concern durin call and tough to close all of them and get back to main screen.5. Hangs atleast twice a week, need to remove battery to reset.6. Speed dial stops working, you need to reset your phone again.7. Calander features are very limited and not flexible as palm calendar.8. tiny button's, tough to dial numbers (but can live with that)9. WIndows mobile 5.0 (horrible)....... Ok I will stop here, you got the point."
2,"When I saw this, I had to rate it... on my 5th one!","I am forced to use this piece of junk through my company. No way would you want to spend your own money on this thing. I am on my 5th one. They just don't work well, are slow, and crash all the time. Poorly designed."
4,good phone,"i use it for personal and not business use so i use windows mobile 6.1 instead of the palm os or my company's os. if you can upgrade i'd highly recommend getting 6.1. watching youtube videos and web browsing is pretty easy and windows mobile in general is like an extension of your desktop, and syncing is easy if you use windows. i'm a mac user but there are programs you can download from windows mobile to sync to a mac. the phone is pretty but not overly hefty, which i think is an advantage over the lighter blackberry. the casing is also better in that it feels more secure in your hand than the blackberry does. my girlfriend has a blackberry and i'd prefer my phone over hers anyday. i'd say the blackberry does have a better keyboard, the treo's takes some getting used to but once your comfortable its farily easy, although i find typos when i type fast. one-hand operation is pretty easy as well."
2,I plan on throwing into the trash,"Very disappointing. The OS freezes, recycles on a whim and the interface is weak. A regrettable purchase.The vendor has replaced it twice to no avail. Good-bye Palm."
1,CAUTION - New Account does not mean new contract,"I have a 650 with a cell number that has been with me for over 10 years. Perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price, I thought my fulfilled contract (I am on month to month now) meant I could qualify for a ""new account"" and keep my number. No such luck. After wasting a few hours dealing with Cingular and then someone in India on behalf of Wirefly, I had to return it. It is ironic that someone who has never had a cell phone can get a price 75% lower than a loyal 13 year customer! I will take the next carrier that offers a reasonable price on a 700 even though I would prefer the 750."
2,Very bad experience,"I ahd to switch to ATT because Ssprint did not cover my new office location well. I made the mistake of signing up for service over the phone. I asked for a Treo with the Palm OS and received the 750 with Windows. It was slow, froze constantly and dropped calls. I finally went to an AT&T store and got the Treo 680 (Palm OS). No dropped calls, no freezes, better signal and more intuitive interface."
4,Fun and thoughtful insights.,Heart thoughts is page after page of simple wisdom for daily life. I always have a copy on my nightstand. Reminds me of Life's Little Reminder's book of poetry.Life's little Reminders
4,Good Thoughts!,"Helps you have better thoughts to use during the day - typical Louise Hay, prefer her full book ""You Can Heal Your Life"" - much better! Nothing by Hay is bad!"
2,Last night of proms without the last night hoopla,"THE ULTIMATE LAST NIGHT OF THE PROMS -- THAT WASN'T!Bought on-line from AmazonHaving enjoyed the Last night at the Proms with Colin Davis amidst all the racket and humour, this was just another CD. No intro by the conductor, no crowd noise, no fun and novelty; just a real let-down. Music was good but no sign of the proms atmosphere and noises. The title is a misrepresentation. If you want proms sounds, don't buy this one!"
2,"Lots of spice, lots of chrome, but pretty flimsy","This product shipped super fast, even with super saver shipping. I believe in 4 days. There's alot of spice here, quite a variety. I thought it was pretty good, though I will definitely have to buy more. The problem is that it's made from very thin metal, and in the process of putting the spice jars in, I realized that the reason I was having so many problems sliding them in was that it was bent all over. Not kinked with a crease, just bent. Big pain in the butt, but not a problem that makes it look ugly. I'd probably go with something a little higher quality. You really do get what you pay for..."
5,This is a great starter spice set,"I am really happy with this spice rack. It spins really smoothly, and I use it all the time. It comes with a good variety of spices. Overall, it was a great purchase."
3,Dumb Spices,"The rack is really nice but most of the spices it comes with are not ones you actually use, and are all basically the same. But just for the rack it's a good deal"
3,Herbs NOT Spices,"I bought this spice rack at BB&B, and was surprised the spices were included (didn't read the packaging) and was also leary of the quality of the spices. But for the most part, they're okay, well, at least the fennel, oregano, and basil that I just used yesterday. Anyway, the thing that bothers me about the spice rack is that THEY ARE NOT SPICES--THEY MOSTLY ARE HERBS!!! I have just as many jars of spices (cinnamon, cardamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice, mace, cloves, anise, etc.) with no where to store them in as organized manner as this rack AND I cannot find a 20-jar Kamenstein with empty jars. Anyway, if you find an identical but empty Kamenstein, please provide a link. Thanks."
3,Missing some important things,"We just picked this up with a gift card we'd received as a wedding gift. Overall I am pleased with the size and functionality. I am not impressed with the spices, though, like others have mentioned. My rack contained no cinnamon, nutmeg, garlic, paprika, or ginger but contained pizza and Italian season as well as sea salt. It's something that can be changed but it is a bummer to have to change something that was just purchased.The one redeeming quality is that my box came with a registration card for free spice refills for 5 years (sans shipping/handling), but I am unsure about the quality of the replacement spices."
3,Damaged in shipping,MEtal is kind of thin. Came damaged but outter and inner box not damaged. Either poor workmanship or or low quality control at factory. The spices looked great but wont know until I get a replacement
