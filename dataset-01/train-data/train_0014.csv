3,A Wonderful Book But...,"These are wonderful interviews by Tom Brokaw. And they give you a sense of pride in our country. But ""The Greatest Generation""? In Vietnam, the soldiers were fighting in the dark, They didn't know why they were fighting (this generation did) and the people at home were against them. But they fought brillantly under the most horrendous circumstances. I have a friend who received 2 silver stars, 6 bronze stars, 2 purple hearts (face and leg) and 2 commendations. He was a green beret. He is not considered a hero by the citizens of the United States. A wonderful book, Tom. But come down to earth. The greatest generation was those who fought in Nam. It's easy to fight when you are right. But not so easy to fight in the dark. END"
2,TV scripts don't always make good books,"There are some touching chapters in this book, but overall, some of the material was less-than-gripping. As I read this book, I could imagine the text as part of a TV news story script complete with old pictures, natural sound, some long pauses in the piece as the camera pushes in or pulls out on the shot. Coupled with the video, these chapters would be powerful. Without the video, they read a bit on the dull side. I can't argue with these people being called the greatest generation but I would argue with those that claim this book as the greatest tribute to the greatest generation"
1,Now we know why he is a newscaster,"Brokaw delivers a lightweight, sketchy, collection of interviews with World War Two vets, which unfortunately has made him a lot of money and spawned equally mediocre sequels.There are an infinite number of far superior books covering the same ground."
1,Contains Transfats,The nutritional information on the packages I got do not match what is on the website here. Each bag has 4g of trans fats. Why the discrepancy? Why do they need to add that to sunflower kernels?
4,Golden Dawn - Updated for our times,"The Golden Dawn by Israel Regardie updated by the Ciceros is a very complete edition. It is a hard read, only because of the detail and sheer volume of information. But it is very illuminating."
4,"Good foundational book, but not everything!","I read this when i was completley new to the golden dawn studies. I would have to say the golden dawn is a really indepth studied, and wouldn't have anyone read these book just out of sheer interests. This book gives a good foundation, but going on to reading the more advanced and classic books by isreal regardie,alister crowler, and Mathers, this book cant tell you the half of it. A good read, but the golden dawn is extrmeley confusing to those unfamiliar!"
3,Just to clarify,"Chic and Sandra Tabatha Cicero have provided the magical community with a wealth of information on practical magic and especially the Golden Dawn system of magic. I have found more than a few of their books helpful. I think that our dear reader from Puyallup, WA is probably just a very devoted member of his or her Order, but his or her views aren't those of the Order as a WHOLE. I think it's pretty safe to say that ANY book by Chic and Sandra Tabatha Cicero would be good to have as a reference book, regardless of whether you belong to a Golden Dawn Order or not."
3,"Does what it says, but isn't inspired or inspiring","Having just finished this book I found it to be a very introductory thesis on the Golden Dawn. It left me wanting.The background on Hermeticism, the first part of the book, is the best part. It's a consise overview of the Western Mystical Tradition.The history of the GD was brief and painless but not new or enlightening.The overview of the work of the GD covers only the introductory grades and is brief. If you're at all familiar with the subject, you'll find it to be a dull retelling of what so many other authors have already revealed.All told the book does what it set out to do - give a boiled down explanation of this influential group. But it looks at it from so many angles, so briefly, that it can only offer the most superficial treatment of each part. This translates into a very superficial appreciation for the GD.Readers with any familiarity with the subject will be dissapointed. Readers without any foreknowledge may wonder what's the point."
5,The teachings and basics of the Golden Dawn belief system,"""The Golden Dawn"" is one of the most respected systems of magic in the world: over a century old, it has its roots in long-reaching traditions. The Essential Golden Dawn is a beginner's guide geared for newcomers to Golden Dawn. The Essential Golden Dawn is written by experts on the topic and explores both the history and the spirituality of this tradition, explaining ideas of magic and magical philosophy and exploring the teachings and basics of the Golden Dawn belief system. An outstanding introduction."
2,Problem With Batteries - Beach Audio Renegs on Return,"The first phone went out within 30 days. Got along without it, until the second phone stopped working.Beach Audio instructed me to re-order, and they'd send me a Return Authorization. Then they renegged.I will not do business with Beach Audio again."
2,Problem with handsets taking/holding a charge,"I bought this phone system about 6-7 months ago. I was happy with the performance, but very recently, two of the handsets failed. I thought it was a battery issue, so I replaced the batteries($30). That doesn't seem to have worked, as both of the handsets still won't take a charge. I have an older 2.4Ghz Vtech which has worked fine for the past 4-5 years, but more recent experiences with VTech have turned me off. Look elsewhere for a more reliable phone system."
1,VTech i6775 Review,"Years ago, I had purchased some VTech products and was very displeased with the their quality. At that time, I swore never to buy VTech again.While recently seeking cordless phones with speakerphone options, I came across the i6775. The price was right, and some time had passed, so I bought two sets (home and office) in June, 2006.There's only a three month warranty on these units, and one set recently (11-2006) died. After finally getting through to VTech support and troubleshooting with them, we couldn't revive the system. The phones are useless, and I'm stuck with them.You can guess my advice."
3,Okay,"This seems to be sturdy and nice looking. Don't order this unless you are sure because there is no canceling it. I ordered it by mistake and tried to cancel it minutes later - no go. But all in all, it's worth keeping once you have it."
4,"Very good on preparation and appreciation of tea, would have liked more on the processing","The strengths of this production lie in the detailed instructions for the preparation of various types of tea, mainly Chinese, and the bits and pieces of tea lore imparted in the interviews (although individuals familiar with the world of tea aren't going to learn much new from them--but it does bill itself as an ""introduction"" so no surprise there). The videography is artful and the selection of tea vessels used during the preparation of the various teas is a visual delight. My only real complaint is that the amount of footage of the processing is much less than I expected from reading the promotional blurb. Personally I would have liked to have more material on the processing."
5,Great Tea DVD,"This is one of the most informative DVD's on tea,and how to prepare tea around today I highly recommend it. Benedic Chin"
2,Disappointed...,"I bought this to get better fuel mileage, but didn't get it.It will give you more power, but forget it if you're looking for better economy.Even using hypermile techniques (light foot, coasting as much as possible) there was no change in economy."
4,bose system,"I am really happy with my radio/cd player, it has great sound, and I am not having to go into my daughter's room to use our stereo, which is right below my neighbors' bedroom, the sound quality is perfect, and I definetely have liked everything that I have purchased from Amazon over the years."
3,High standby power consumption,"It's hard to find information on the power consumption of many products, even though the cost of energy can sometimes add up to be more than the purchase price. I found a report on the web from someone who had surveyed ""stanby"" power consumption of all the electronics in his house. This product had one of the highest standby power consumptions: about 6 W. That's when the radio and CD player are off. It's much higher than it needs to be just to run the clock--typical clock radios are 1 to 3 W. I ended up getting the Sony ICF-CD831 instead, which consumes around 1.5 W. Of course, the sound quality (and the price) are much lower so it isn't directly comparable."
1,realllly....,"i dont think this should be listed as ""bullet proof"" or even bb proof. some idiot will get hurt with these.found this while searching for kevlar"
1,never got here,i wouldnt trust the company it never got to my house i thnik the mail man stole it from me!
3,ITS OK,"Alot of pockets, and big SWEAT letters. But all useless. no where to put your pistole, and big pockets..... i don't know what they are for. The mag pouches are ok. big and deep. others... not so much."
1,No. Just No.,"looks cool. Key word people ""looks"" cool, it isn't bullet proof, please don't think it is, or that pockets make you look the part."
2,I don't know why you buy this,"Not comprehensive or outlined or organized. A lot of talk with nothing. Beginer stuff like RSI, MACD and MA are 1/3 of the book, another 1/3 on Dow theory. Charts patterns, nothing in here like projection of target price, failuer rate and trading tactics. You want a good book on price chart patterns. I suggest ""Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns"", Bulkowski."
2,Technical Analysis of stock trends is a tiring book.,"BORING. I started to read about the Dow Theory with old fashioned charts of defunct stocks. There are supplements to the text to bring in modern stocks, but maybe one should retire this book."
1,Tech Analysis is a bunch of BUNK,This book along with all other books and seminars on tech analysis are mere ploys to make the authors wealthy.
5,Excellent Dow Theory Explanation,"Robert Edwards description and analysis of the Dow Theory is, as Professor Bassetti so astutely states on page 48, a ""magisterial presentation"". I am proud to have been asked to add my interpretation to the update since Dr. Edwards death. Believe it or not, the Dow Theory is alive and well in the 21st Century and this book will help you understand why.Jack Schannep"
1,Reprint of a old-edition (1948 ?! ),"The book is the reprint of a old edition date back 1948 with some little update up to 1963. The Amazon's Search-Inside(TM) refer to another update version of the book (9 ed.). The book's style and content is very old, the charts are hand-made and frankly speaking now it's possible to do much better and the calculation of indicators now can be exact. If you are interested to the prehistory of technical analysis a would suggest ""Welles Wilder - New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems"". Modern and better books are those of Achelis and Colby."
2,Project Manager,The book is a reprint of a much older book. Since the original book was written there have been a number of significant advances in computing power and software and this book is very much dated.
5,A must-have,I still havn't finished this but what i have studied has been of great help in identifying chart patterns and warning me off otherwise recommended stocks. This edition in particular seems to be the ultimate edition to own as the later editions get away from the original authors' intentions.
3,"Thorough, slightly boring and expensive","Edwards and Magee is considered one of the bibles of technical analysis. While it covers the basics well (head and shoulders tops, etc.), the shear number of not so well known patterns can be overwhelming. I would doubt most people could (or would) finish this book. It's more of a reference book. John Murphy's Technical Analysis of the Futures Markets is a much better choice. Murphy covers trendlines, patterns, stochastics, Elliot Wave, money management and a host of other technical topics. Don't be fooled by its title -- it's quite applicable to stocks."
4,Technical Analysis of Stock Trends,"Good book, if you really want to learn stock analysis. It gets you thinking for yourself about the movements of stocks. There is no way one can absorb all the information provided within the text. It is a guide and reference for those who want to devote time to stock analysis. I am now more educated on stock trends, but still require the book for periodic refreshers. If you're buying this book for casual reading, find another book. Although very good, this book is very intense and reading it will consume some time. Dedication is required to finish the book, but the potential for success is great, much greater than a lottery ticket."
1,Worst service ever,"The product itself is great, but it came in a plain brown box that didn't even fit the telescope and with part of it sticking out of the box. There were no instructions and no star chart. After 3 months of dealing with this company and filing a complaint with Amazon I am still having trouble with them. I will be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau and today will file another complaint with Amazon. I would never order from this company again."
3,Good children's telescope,"This product was purchased for a five year old's birthday. The knobs and focusing dials are rubber coated and contrasting colors making them very fun to play with. The image quality is good for this range of telescope. Great tripod, sturdy. The map light and lit up dials are a plus for the kids. I would recommend for a first time telescope."
5,Wonderful book,"This book is filled with beautiful pictures that any one would enjoy. I bought it for myself, but my mother ended up with it. The photographs are amazing."
5,Almost impossible photography,"The photographs in this amazing book are not only beautiful, they would have been almost impossible to capture without extreme patience and technical skill. Being a photographer for many years I was amazed to read in the end pages how the images were taken. Using a 4""x5"" camera!To be able to place a subject like a cat in front of a large-format camera which manually needs to be carefully focussed on a ground-glass at the back of the camera, the lens set to the required aperture and shutter speed, lens cocked, the film-holder dark-slide inserted and then, above all, choosing the decisive moment to take the exposure, is an amazing feat!What a fantastic photographer, a master artiste."
5,Great!,This is a really cute book with beautiful pictures. I like the quotes that have been included as well.
3,Selling Out??? Yes and No,"I've had Volumizer for a little over a year now. I always liked the album and promised myself I would buy the actual album the day it came out without listening to any of the new songs. Well I achieved my goal, and when I heard Grown Up, Lemon Drop and Lost & Found I wanted to cry, it was obviously an attempt to get radio play and to sell more records. The new songs soundd almost boybandish, Special J is barely in any of the new songs, the lyrics are too wholesome, and they aren't the 2 Skinnee J's I've been listening too since Super Mercado."
3,Not as good as supermercado but the J's are still kickin it,"This cd still hasn't come out and I don't know why. It is a great cd and i'm sure would sell. it however isn't as good as supermercado, but is still good and very worth checking out."
5,MAN THESE POPS IN SPACE,this cd good yeh it cool i listen and lie down yeh it good buy it but dont hop
5,Not Supermercado but close.,"You either love 2 Skinnee J's or hate them. I happen to be in the first part of the equation. I have listened to Supermercado numerous times and catch them in concert whenever I can. This CD has been 4 years in the making. It is a good listen. I have had the final release for two days now and have listened to it no less than five times. But where are songs like ""Stockholm Love"" the first single that was released in 2000? This CD is definately worth buying, but it will be more meaningful if you see some of these songs performed live first."
3,Very good cd but.....,"If you heard the last version of Volumizer with Stockholm Love and Secret Frequency, thats the better one. the 3 new songs are all really bad and don't sond like 2 skinnee js and dont fit with the rest of the cd at all. aside from the 3 bad songs grown up, lemon drop and lost and found the rest of the songs are really good and if you liked super meracd or their previous eps then you like these songs. the cd is worth buying even with the few horrible songs."
1,SUGARJAY,"To those of you first hearing the j's you might actually like this record. But to those of you who like the previous intelligent hip hop stylings of return of the new and improved, sing earthboy sing, and supermercado you might find yourself staring at your cd player thinking what is this? I had a promo of this record last year before they switched labels and i didn't really like it back then but i figured when the new version comes out maybe it will be better..sadly i was very let down. It's almost like they are a completly new band. More alternative sugar ray/gimmicky radio songs instead of hip hop. I think the fact that they lost amays and andy action had something to do with it but i could be wrong. if your a j's fan who knows you might like it. if this is your first time definatly pick up supermercado first"
4,Volumizer is volumtastic,"The 2SJ never cease to amaze me. I've been waiting for ""Volumizer"" for about a year to come out... the wait was worth it. The album is a concoction of beats and instruments that is sure to make anyone a fan for life. Join the 2SJ army!If you loved ""Supermercado"" then pick this baby up."
2,"Big fan of Adams, but this book ...","I am a big fan of Dougles Adams books, at least in general.But this book is, at best, only marginally funny. Others have explored this topic, and with better results.The problem here is that Adams tries to make funny sounding words for things that don't have a name (like that little twist between link sausages), but constrains himself to using the names of small cities and towns from around the world. Occasionally, he hits a home run, but most of the words are strike outs.Disapointed.PS the 'name' for the link between sausages is kerry. Why, I don't know, and I have no idea why some think this is humorous."
2,pointless.,"Unlike Adams' other works, this provides no satire, and very very little humor. The entire purpose of the book is to identify cities and towns whose names do not obviously make sense, redefine the name as a noun and bestow upon it a nonsensical definition. The only reason I didn't rate it a one or half star, is because it wasn't offensive, aside from the $8 lost."
3,"Please, some more.","I didn't know until now that this book existed. What I am doing is reviewing its predecessor, The Meaning of Liff. That, I have to say, is as funny a book as I've ever read. It had me in hysterics, even when I was ill, unemployed and going through divorce. It might not be too obvious to US readers just how funny this is, if you're not familiar with some of the stranger place names (Quaking Houses, for example, is close to where I live in N. E. England. Shaking Houses isn't far from there.) Consett isn't the last course of a meal, it's a nearby village. Why 3 stars? It's provisional. I'm sure that reading this would result in 5+ for reasons given."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped...,"I don't feel it's up to Adams' usual standard, nor as good as ""sniglets""--remember them? I don't like the idea of using existing words--usually proper nouns. More imagination was needed. And I didn't get the illustrations."
2,Not what I was expecting.,"This book is set up as a dictionary. If you enjoy reading dictionaries, then please purchase this book. The humor was lost on me because of the format."
5,I love it!,"This book is wonderful- I really loved it and laughed out loud more than once. It' not for everybody, but it does have a wonderful sense of humor and it describes perfectly several situations you have lived trough. Too bad for the very British ones that I missed, not being British. But overall a wonderful read."
2,This book is pointless.,You can't learn much from this book. This book contains only questions and answers(with explaination). That's about all. Nothing much. Don't expect this book will teach you how to install SQL. It will only ask you to refer to book online.
3,great bag,it a perfect bag for shoes. a bit too big though. probably just enough size for size 13 shoes.too pricy for a small piece of nylon fabric...
1,One of the biggest blunders,"MTL really screwd-up bigtime by issuing the same UPC number to their entire music catalog. Most Marketplace sellers on Amazon upload their product by UPC, so you can end up with any title from the MTL catalog. Before purchasing this title or any title from the MTL line, be sure to inquiry as to what the Marketplace seller is offering! This will save you a ton of stress.As far as the album ""SOUL HITS, Vol 1"" goes... it is definitely worth having and is chocked full of classic soul jams we all love. It is definitely a great addition to any collection... if you can find it!Good Luck!"
2,This ain't the one...,"If you are looking for an axe to take down trees larger than 4-5""... This ain't the one for you. This is a camp hatchet with a longer handle. It is to light to have enough energy to cut effectively. There is a reason this thing sells for about $30. I used to like Gerber products, but anymore it seems like cheap china crap, is all that they are selling. I have a Gransfor Brunks axe and it is a joy to swing, this thing is all work. It took 4 times as long with the Gerber then it did with the Gransfor's. I thought it would be a good back up or second axe. While it will cut wood, the effort expended is not worth it. If at all possible go for a better axe.Pros:CostSharp out of the boxCons:To lightNot energy efficient (you have to work to hard for what you get)Made in ChinaCheaply made"
2,Short axe,Good quality but not manly. Seems to be the length for a teenager. If looking for a small axe it is fine. If looking for a man's axe look elsewhere.
4,Historic and amusing,The cards are a mixture of characters and caricatures of golfers in the far distance past.Masters and duffers combine in an interesting and amusing collection. The dress is so different to what the modern golfer wears. Collectors will value.
5,"FAST SERVICE: CLEAN, NEW BOOK",This was a very interesting read about the beginning of the modern foodie movement and the Frenchman responsible for it. The historic recipies included make it possible for a modern reader to eat as royalty once did.
5,Thomas Light,Perfect for a tiny bathroom. Was looking for a nautical look and ahcieved that with an upadated twist by picking the brushed nickel.
2,another brick i have to carry to the surface,I'd rather shoot myself than lean from this book again.
4,"Book great, cassettes okay...","This book is clear and comprehensive, yet simple enough for a complete beginner. The reader can choose to learn just spoken Hindi or to also learn to read and write since all of the dialogs are written in romanized Hindi as well as in the Devanagari syllabary. The cassettes are necessary, but poor compared to the cassettes from other courses. The dialogs are read only once, very quickly, with almost no opportunity to practice repeating what you hear. The leftover space on the tapes are filled with discussion in English of questionable utility."
3,a nice book but not the best,"I actually looked forward to receiving this book. As English is my native tongue, and I had studied French/Japanese at school, I was looking for an easy book that would teach me the hindi alphabet and provide me with some easily referenceable vocabulary. Whilst this book provides some assistance on both, I didn't find the layout to be very useful. I would have also preferred more attention on how to write the characters.I'd still recommend this book, but a little more visual assistance (the book is a bit dry, as it is predominantly textual) would have enhanced my learning speed, as well as more romanization of hindi words, especially for beginners such as myself."
4,Unlocking the mystery of the Hindi language,"If you have been learning Hindi by the Pimsleur language system, you may have wanted a book to answer your questions. This is the book. It is excellent. However, if you plan to use the book and tapes or CD's to learn to speak Hindi, it is lacking. The best of worlds would combine the two into a single system."
3,Very Detailed,"If you are looking into learning Hindi, this book is super duper detailed. I was looking for something that was more conversational Hindi, and what i got was something that was way more than i bargained for, in turn, turning me off to the entire thing. This book is for those who really want to learn hindi inside out upside down."
4,Great for Beginners!!!!,"I bought this set and was glad I did. I wanted to learn to speak, read, and write hindi. Within 2 weeks of buying the book, I was able to pronounce and recognize the hindi characters, as well as begin to read some words. I cannot say that I became conversational, but I can pick up words here and there when someone speaks to me. I appreciate the listen and speak lessons that the tapes/cds provide. It is really important to learn the different sounds of hindi, especially some of the sounds are not ones we use in english at all. I recommend this for beginners. if you really want to advance though, you have to take what you learn, and talk to a native speaker, because that is the only way you will advance is if you use what you learned. This covers the basics to get started."
3,If you ignore or dislike grammar buy it,"It's a good option for those who cannot understand grammar or those who hate it. Personally, I'd prefer something more grammatical. The author avoids using any grammar rules and terms. I don't really like this.Also if you don't want to learn the devanagari it's a good option. You can move throughout the whole book without using a single letter of the Hindi script"
4,Comforting,"I got this for a friend who had a miscarriage. I first read it and was very moved, often to tears. An excellent book! Recommend getting this along with two other (in my opinion) even BETTER books: I'll Hold You in Heaven Remembrance Book and Mommy, Please Don't Cry."
2,difficult to read,"After experiencing a loss recently, I was looking for books to help me during the difficult days that follow. I was looking for more personal experience or scientific info. All of the references to the bible in relation to pregnancy loss just did not make a connection with me. I am a spiritual person, but I just did not find this book very helpful. There are many other books that I found informative and comforting."
4,"It was a good book. It is a good healing book, journal.",This book was very good to help with the healing process. I used it for a journal and it's a great reference book! I would recommend this to anyone who has lost a child.
5,"An uplifting, honest publication","Thank you, Kathe, for openly sharing your journey through the grief. This spiritual publication has opened up so many different emotions for me, so many unexpected feelings of loss, guilt, anger... After taking the journey myself, I have begun to walk again -- with others -- through their grief and pain. Thank you for providing the structure and 'path' which opens up the possibility for healing. Wonderful work, guided by God..."
5,Just What I Needed...,"This is the perfect book for those of us who have faced the sudden and unexpected end of a pregnancy. I didn't know how to grieve my loss, after all, I had never seen or held or touched or heard my baby, but all the same, I felt an unexplainable depth of pain and loss. This book helped me to validate my unborn child's existence, give him or her an identity, and work through the process of healing. Five months after my loss, I still hurt and grieve and ache for my baby, but I know I'm on the road to recovery and will continue to recover with the help of books like this one. I also ordered one for my mother, who suffered a miscarriage 33 years ago...she said it even helped her to deal with the loss of that ""unknown"" child so long ago. I would recommend this to anyone who has suffered a pregnancy loss, who has lost a young child, or who loves someone who is going through such a difficult time as that."
5,Very helpful!,I read/journaled in this book after my second miscarriage. It helped me with things that I did not even know I needed help with. I liked the guided questions and found them to be very helpful. I also know someone who read this 6 months after her miscarriage and she found she had already worked through a lot of the things that the book touches upon. Overall great book and made me feel more normal with the reactions I have had.
4,"Great CD, just not exactly what I was looking for.","This CD highlights one boys voice mostly. He has an angelic voice and is very talented, but if you didn't know it was a boy singing, you might think it was a girl or even an adult.I was hoping this CD would have more of a boyhood quality to it. Meaning, the singing would have lots of treble, but also an unmistakable boy sound. I was also hoping that I would hear more of the rest of the choir, rather than just the one boy.It is a very peaceful CD though, and I do not regret buying it."
3,Adequate and Expensive,"There's a lot to like about this angelic voice. In addition, the selected songs are as ethereal as one might wish...evoking faint images of Eternity glimpsed but not comprehended and angels singing at the feet of God, if not dancing on the heads of pins.This said, the CD...as physically delivered to one's door by incarnate beings...is only adequate in quality and annoyingly overpriced. The mix is mundane: dynamic range is lacking and the voices (human and instrumental) are not well localized. Overall, the product seems on par with something one might purchase by phone from ""an operator standing by for $19.95 plus shipping and handling."" For the gold-plated asking price of ""Requiem"", my Audio by VanAlstine equipment should have been put to the test. It wasn't.Bottom line: likeable stuff in an indifferent package at a burdensome price...the perfect storm of attributes that, unfortunately, tends to promote illegal file sharing among the less scrupulous."
5,The voices of angels,"I feel so sad because I can't find the Boys air choir's CDs in China.But I bought them when I saw them on Amazon by friend's help.Oh,their voices are so beautiful!In fact,5 stars is really really not enough for their CDs!And there is a question I really need your help:Why don't you have their 3-CD box set named ""Angel's Music Box""(It's really a beautiful box set!) or their 3rd album ""Air""? I trust Amazon could get them!"
1,Crazy Elephant CD,There is only one song on this CD worth listening to. Do not buy CD. I was very disappointed in this CD.
1,The production crew done her wrong...,"I would like to blame the director, but, didn't she preview her own material?Whatever it is that would account for the awful audio -- the sound mixing, or Ms. Corn's strident, almost lecturing tone as she reads her voice-over script -- I found it remarkably annoying and distracting. Also, the sequencing is not unique enough to get lost in the practice, so to speak. I really wanted to like this DVD; Ms. Corn has lovely form and provides a good demonstration of the standard poses, but there is nothing novel enough about the two practices to justify keeping this DVD in my collection when I find myself slipping into grit-my-teeth-asana as I try to concentrate on the music, which can barely be detected behind the grating narration. A big disappointment."
1,Horrible,"Worst instructional video I have ever used. She talks and talks and talks and moves real fast. I had an extremely difficult time catching up to her and then she is on to the next move.The video starts with about 20 minutes of advertisement and the next 20 minutes is just watching her move. You must use the remote to find the ""instructional"" part. What a waste. I just wish I could get her address and let her know I will never buy anything with her name on it."
2,Could've Been Good -- Too Much Talking/Lecturing,"I've done both workouts on this DVD, and I enjoyed the moves/poses; I also liked the two different workout options -- 35. min & 60 min. But, honestly, I dread using this video again because I do not want to hear all the lecturing about the environment, about forgiving people, about the ""planet's blessings,"" etc... it almost seemed like it was a lesson on how yoga was the answer to all problems. For me, that is why I go to church and why I read my Bible. I really liked the idea of using this dvd for good flexibility, etc., but I'm not up for the over-the-top lecturing over and over. This is why I find it so difficult to find a good yoga dvd. I will keep looking."
3,A Good Guide - Weak on Photos,"This is a massive 700 page guide suitable to the large State of California, a state that has many places to explore and visit.It has a comprehensive description of almost every area of California and has excellent maps and guides including street maps of San Francisco. You will not be disappointed with this book as a guide. You will be disappointed with a lack of photographs. A picture is worth a 1000 words and this book has virtually none. So if you are buying just one book, then buy Eyewitness Travel Guides DK - California which is almost as big - 630 pages but has stunning photos. If you are buying more than one book, consider this Frommer guide."
3,used paperback book,"Book came on time and as ordered. It had some stains that weren't mentioned in description, but basically, its a used book so I got what I paid for."
3,"Realistic, poetic and directionless","I enjoyed this book. The character is compelling because her mission is, and those around her each have fully-developed personae and thus are fascinating to watch, but at the point where this story is ready to take off, it goes nowhere. Lydia, our strong female lead, rejects male attachment, but the author's point seems to be her soldiering on without needing something to fill that void. However, the other void, that of change or rise in her life, is not addressed, and the book ends up tapering out to a conclusion that reminds me of the null poetry of innumerable urban wordsmith slams I've attended. The point is the no point. But do we need another voice telling us that, when we already have death to stare us down at the end of a full life? I would read more from this author, and appreciated the strengths of this book, but find it drifting in the entropic grey area of all things that fence-sit."
2,If you like cowboy lit you will enjoy this.,A wonderful past pace for western lit. Molly Gloss give her readers plenty of time to enjoy the setting that she has detailed in this book.
2,Yawn,"This book and the setting seemed to have so much potential, yet Gloss failed to give soul to her characters. I never identified with any of the characters or cared about their future. The bad guys were evil, the heroine heroic, the cowboys shallow but no characterization beyond the stereotypes. Page after page of obstacles to overcome, yet no insights to be gained. If this book hadn't been a selection of my book group, I never would have stuck it out to the end."
3,half&half,"Liked Tamogotchi and Spain a lot!Didn't like Sore head or other Rock'n'roll one much.Tamogotchi is an odd tune in that it sounds like no other band i can really think of,which is a pretty neat thing.Spain is a lovely emotional song with an amazing""sample""?Sort of hoping it's a ""Love me do"" thing.Average first single.Amazing future.We'll have to wait and see i suppose."
2,not that good,all the songs in my opinion are very cheesey. I only like the first song. the rest....are all CHEEZY!
4,Spiritually Inspirational,This release from New Direction was blessed. The tracks on this cd in my opinion are for easy listeners. A cd for those who need to get a away and reflect on their lives and relationship with CHRIST.
2,2 Good Songs That it,"I just heard this CD my friend was going crazy over the guy on Worship Christ. She says that she saw them perform this some years ago and he was awesome (better than Kirk, Deitrick etc) She says he was doing all the Michael Jackson and daincing stuff but in a unique way before all of them. I admit Worship Christ is awesome his flow is off the meter. I also like New direction the title song but the flow is weak and sounds like a bootleg gangsta rapper trying to be church. I don't know who the guy is but he is wet. I know it is church but I am not really into church. But Worship christ made me wanna get more into church music. If anybody knows who that guy is or if he has more music out let me know. His name isnt on the CD but I think they call him Mr Kas or Cash or something like that."
3,AN OK CD FOR A DEBUT,"NEW DIRECTION IS THE CHOIR BUT FOR A DEBUT ALBUM THIS CD IS OK. ITS NOT THE BEST BUT IT IS OK. SOME SONGS LIKE LIGHTHOUSE, WHO DO YOU ROLL WITH, NEW DIRECTION AND WORSHIP CHIRST ARE GOOD. BUT THE REST OF THE SONGS ARE WEAK. WELL I FORGOT ONE DANCE AND SATIFIED ARE GOOD TO. LIKE I SAID BEFORE THIS CD IS WEAK AND YOU CAN BUY IT IF YOU WANT TO BUT GO AND BUY THEIR OTHERS ONES. THEY ARE BETTER THAN THIS.NOW DONT GET ME WRONG THIS CHOIR IS ON FIRE FOR THE LORD BUT I JUST THINK THAT FOR SOME SONGS THEY COULD HAVE DONE BETTER AND THEY HAVE DONE BETTER. I JUST DONT LIKE THIS CD."
3,Solid contemporary gospel.,"This album loses a little steam towards the end. And despite the name of this admittedly talented group, there's no musical concepts that we haven't already heard elsewhere. Having said that, you could do worse than add this to your collection. Best listened to when: driving!NOTE: This artist isn't to be confused with the other ""New Direction,"" a group that is definitely NOT gospel."
1,confused,I just want to know how I pulled this up when I clicked on a cutting board to &quot;view details&quot; on a bridal registry??? This isn't the first time this has happened!!
5,THEY ARE BACK,"They are back the girl group that has a 4x platinum cd (that means they sold over four million copies of SURVIVOR). Man i was really hesitent to buying this cd because, face it they kinda died out a whille a go, but anyways I have boughten remix cds that i am not very happy with (example: ALL SAINTS- The Remix Album) This cd is excellent I can't get over the tracks, My favorite song is jumpin jumpin (remix) lil bow wow rox on this track. Also the song EMOTIONS (remix) is great some one below stated that it does not play smoothely, my [butt] ! Its a grat dance tune. Take my advice, trust me (I have over 250 cds, this is definitly in the top 30) and go buy this kick [butt] cd!"
1,Disappointing,"In an effort to tide fans over while they decide what the hell their next move will be--if in fact there is a next move--Destiny's Child have taken it upon themselves to release this remix album. What a disappointment. While their previous two studio records showed occasional flashes of musical and vocal greatness, this album sets them back miles, catering to every beats-to-the-wall formula that is saturating radio airwaves and in the process rendering nearly every song a futile exercise in staccato riffs and loud, obnoxious drum programming. Only on the Maurice Joshua remix of 'So Good' does the music show any signs of joy and life. And the Michelle Williams track tacked on at the end only further strengthens what many have always believed--both Williams and Kelly Rowland would do wise to leave the singing to Beyonce Knowles and continue in their roles as highly paid background vocalists--nuff said."
3,great job,i like this cd it got all the songs i like on which is the remix i think destiney child over done there selves
1,Waste,"How sad is it that this CD was released. A supposed ""Hiatus"" yes. They just released this to cash in on their fans, and so no one will forget them. How can we when they are shoved in our faces at every possible moment, even when they are supposedly taking a break! So until they decide what they want from their careers, they will still manage to be a cash cow for their fans. Elsewhere, these remixes are far from anything good. Just another sad piece of plastic which isn't worth the time of day...Why don't they just take time off, I mean really take time off, and come back with something that is a good album? After SURVIVOR, I have no hopes for this disapointing group which was once good. This only adds to my disapointment."
3,THROW TOGETHER PROJECT,"THEIR PRODUCERS HAD NOTHING ELSE BETTER TO DO THAN BUT A DIFFERENT TUNE TO THEIR MOST POPULAR SONGS.DON'T GET MEWRONG,I LIKE DESTINY'S CHILD BUT I DON'T LIKE THIS PROJECTOVERALL."
2,get of stage a review from kevin f,oh my god this has to be the stupidest remix cd i have ever heard it sucks they cant sing for nothing the beat i is mess up oh my god please pepole dont buy this cd
1,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,I bought this CD because I love Destiny's Child but this is a tired selection of so called remixes.
1,"Dear Lord, What Happened Here?","It used to be that when artists released a new album, they released a NEW album. Now we get live albums, useless Holiday recordings, and shoddily-made remix releases. This album falls into the third category, and as far as remix albums go, the results are catastrophic. Predictible hip-hop remixes of singles we've heard a zillion times before abound, while the FEW house mixes are as flat as soda left at room temperature for hours. Listen, nobody says you can't do a remix album, but give the listeners some variety and a groove. I actually like Destiny's Child, but after ""The Writing's on the Wall,"" their music is getting more and more vanilla. Should you feel the urge to get this CD, just say ""no, no, no."""
5,THE REMIX IS IN !,"THIS ALBUM HAS SO MANY GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT.THE WHOLE CD IS NOTHING BUT BOOTYSMAKIN GOOD.(BOOTYLICIOUS LICK'EN GOOD)THE REASON I GAVE DC(3) A 5 IS BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE KELLY,MICHELLE, AND B'EYONCE IN IT.IT ALSO HAVE MY OLD TWO GIRLS.LATOYA AND LATAVIA.THIS WHOLE CD IS THE BOMB.AND I REALLY THINK U SHOULD GET IT. DC(3) 3EVER."
2,Boring Waste of Time!,"I bought this CD in hopes that some of Destiny's Child's songs would get a better beat or become more interesting for dancing. What I got was a horrible butchering of ""Emotion,"" a never-ending ""Bootylicious,"" a ""Say My Name"" mix anyone would be more than happy to do without and mixes of songs that weren't very good the first time around- several weren't even singles! (Dot, Nasty Girl, So Good)To make that sound better, they throw in Independent Women Pt. II, which is taken directly from ""Survivor,"" and hawk a song from Michelle Williams' upcoming solo debut (Heart to Your, Apr. 16). It's sad when the best song on a group's mix CD is one from the member going solo.I would not recommend this CD at all, if you like Destiny's Child, get Survivor or Writing's on the Wall. If you're looking for good new R&B check out Ashanti instead."
1,Buy 883476028965 instead.,"As anyone can clearly tell from the reviews, this bundle (which is three existing DVDs shrink-wrapped together with a sheet of paper bearing the ""cover"" image rubber cemented to the front -- not a space-saver) only contains the rated cuts of FEAST II and FEAST III. However, TWC has seen fit (finally) to fix this decision by quietly releasing a new DVD. The revised set comes in a single, regular-width DVD case, and all three discs are the Unrated versions. The UPC for that version is 883476028965, and it can be found at many Wal-Marts (right now anyway) for $10. If you want a space-saving, all-Unrated way to get the FEAST movies for cheap, track down that one and pass on this one."
2,2 & 3 are NOT UNRATED,Just got mine today and found out that BOTH sequels are rated R and NOT unrated as the packaging says it is!
2,Very uncomfortable,"I've been trying to love these shoes for three weeks now but all I have to show for my effort is a foot full of blisters. I bought them from a very reputable running store where I know all of the employees and I'm quite sure the fit was fine. But hey, you may have a different experience.I've also found that the run itself is alot harder on my knees than the runs I take with my Asics 2090s.Finally, be careful in making your color selection. It's fun to sport the yellow but it's really, really hard to coordinate this color with anything in your wardrobe."
1,Confusing Illumination,These are not HID. One star for false advertising. Persons unfamiliar with headlight technology are confused my this type of misinformation. It is typical for non-HID lamps to advertise that they have Xenon gas and that is confusing enough (although technically true). But to call these lights HID is just plain inaccurate and misleading.
1,Fake blue Lights,These lights are not blue.I can't even tell that I've changed mine from stock bulbs.There is absolutely no difference here.They don't deserve one star.Absolutely do not buy these..It's a waste of time and money.CON
3,Not great but not bad either,It made my headlights slightly brighter but not as much as I had hoped. If you have regualar headlights that are currently working I say stick with them. If you a headlight goes out replace them with one of these as it is slightly brighter.
2,Burton the explorer not the actor,"Burton,s life was amazing and his adventures were beyond belief so how come I had such a hard time getting thru this book. Because the author can't tell a story. I was very disapointed in the way this author tried to tell about one of histories most interesting lives."
4,Good fit / Good price,I found that these worked very well on my toyota camry and the price was great as well. Would have been five stars but the rotors were made in China. I had ordered some Beck/Arnley rotors in the past that were from South America and was hoping for the same for these. They still work just as well and fit the same but I was hoping to get away from buying from China. I have had very good luck with Beck/Arnley products in the past and will continue to use them in the future.
2,Horse received was not as pictured.,"I ordered this Standing Horse, expecting to get what is pictured. Instead, I got a rearing horse, which has the two front legs in the air. I am still trying to resolve this with Amazon. The quality is fine otherwise - a small, crudely carved, lightweight wooden (balsa wood?) horse."
4,Neglected genius,"Jean Goldkette should be mentioned along with Paul Whiteman when people talk about the great white jazz bands of the 1920s. Besides his exciting arrangements, he was an innovator. When other bands used a tuba, Goldkette use a bass. And while other bands used a banjo, Goldkette had a guitar player. Another reason Goldkette's arrangement are recognizable: jazz violin solos. Many bands simply had the violinist in the background playing the main melody. Goldkette had Joe Venuti fiddling away. The only drawback to this recording is the haphazard use of noise reduction. Sometimes it's not there, other times it's in full force, and that causes a distraction from the great music."
4,Why the '20's Roared,"This disc contains a brief history of great music from the '20's interspersed with embarassing schlock that would make a mother wince. Most people will buy it, and justly so, to hear Bix; however, after listening, the discerning buyer will be happy that he has heard Steve Brown, a very under-rated musician, at his best. Frank Trambauer carries his friend Bix, either through direct inspiration or with wonderful counterpoint in several of the songs. Some of the cuts, like I Didn't Know, have been mastered through a string telephone. But carping about the sound when you're listening to history, or complaining that Chauncey Morehouse was only permitted one high-hat and a snare in the studio, and thus criticising his drumming seems tawdry.This is a great addition for both jazz neophyte and discerning collector of twenties memoribilia. But when you hear the ""restoration"" [sic], you will mourn again the passing of John Davies, who knew how to treat this sort of material."
1,Great music disappointingly mastered,This is a great band let down by odd noise reduction. The filtering keeps flipping on and off in the middle of songs making it hard to enjoy the music. There are much better ways to present historical material. Very disappointing!!
4,Nice Muff,"Well lets face it, who doesn't like a nice warm muff? No seriously this thing is great. It warms up nicely in about 5 minutes in the microwave and stays warm for a good 10-15 minutes, which is plenty of time for me to warm up my wrist before stretching exercises. Also, it smells great, although some in the house have complained that the aroma is overpowering - get bent. It looks to be well constructed and I expect it to hold up for a long time. Sure it was a little pricey considering it's a freaking bean bag, but it definitely performs as promised so I can't complain."
2,no bueno.,"This leaves your skin dry & not lumenescent like the other neo strata aha lotion. Tingles must work, but your skin does not look smoother afterwards."
2,Package in damaged condition,"Not the external package, but the box for this product is damaged. The lotion spilt over the bottle and made me don't wanna try it on my skin."
3,yuck,This product stings my face. Does not do what it claims. No information on how to return product.
2,That was not what I expected,"I was really excited about the product after I read some reviews. When I got the product I used the first night and went to bed, next morning I had the most surprising results from this product, smooth skin like a velvet free of any lumps, however, the followed days my skin just came back the same rough skin as usual. I am still using the product even I know my skin is the same. No more velvet skin or nothing. I do have Keratosis, I bought this product believing in the reviews that I got from people with the same skin condition than mine. I used on my face also to try to take off some dark spot from sun, it didn't work yet.So I don't like this product because did not do anything for me. I feel I thrown money away."
4,Great show,"This is such a great video to teach your child about self esteem. Plus, it's just plain silly! I really like Larry Boy and his suction cup ears. Boy, do these guys really like to act silly! My toddler just loves watching these guys and it really is refreshing to see something so positive for a change."
5,Le encantó a mi niña de 3 años...,"Vivo en El Salvador y tengo una niña de 3 años, compré el video para enseñarlo en la escuela dominical, mi sorpresa fué que al verlo yo en la casa mi niña de 3 años se interesó en el video y me preguntaba que era lo que decían los vegetales (ella no habla inglés). A medida se desarrollaba el video yo le contaba la historia.... El dia siguiente ella me pidió ver el video nuevamente y a medida ella veía el video, se lo contaba a su primito.... NO IMPORTA EL IDIOMA, las historias de la Biblia llegan al corazón, no al entendimiento....Ahora estoy pensando en comprar otro video para la escuela dominical, porque mi niña no quiere soltar el que actualmente tengo."
4,Fun for Everybody!,"My daughter loves this David and Goliath re-telling. So do my nephews, who received this video for Christmas. They sing along to the catchy songs and laugh at the jokes, but most importantly - they *get* the message.The Veggie Tales series is popular in my family, My husband and I adore the silly songs, my 30 year old brother likes to watch them, and even the great grandma appreciates them! Fun, clean humor is such a rarity nowadays that adults have to ""resort"" to kids videos."
5,Big Idea Productions and Lyrick Studios strick again!,"This is one of the best VeggieTales movies ever! Jr. Asapargus (Dave) fights a giant pickle (Golieth) in the retelling of a biblical classic. Larry the Cucumber (not a pickle) gets two thumbs up for the silly song ""I Love My Lips"". Sunday morning values and Saturday morning fun!"
4,It was such a awesome veggie tales I want to see it again!,This was so awesome and I wish that I actually own the whole series
1,This arrived broken,This item arrived broken. I had it shipped for Christmas but it was defective and now I have to pay $2.50 more if I want to return it. Hardly worth my trouble.
5,veggie tales,Veggie Tales: Dave and the Giant Pickleexcellent movie for children involving religious background from the bible with a musical twist. my granddaughter loved it.
1,Well....,"While he was filming another movie in Toronto, we went out and bought this horrible movie so we could get him to sign it. You know what he wrote? ""I Hate this Movie. Greg Kinnear"""
3,Looking for a romantic film with a happy ending?,"This is just the perfect film if you're one of those people with nothing better to do on a Friday night... The plot is rather predictable, but that makes it all the more interesting to see how the whole story turns out. It's a good film for all you romantic people out there... I personally think this is one of those films where they got the characters 'just-right'... Cheers!"
1,"This is a horrible, horrible movie.",I made the mistake of seeing this movie in the theater tried hard to get my money's worth. It was impossible. The dialog was so contrived and mindless. There was not a laugh to be had and the chemistry between Kinnear and Holly was nonexistent.
4,Slightly dated but still good mystery,"Quite a few suspects and a nasty murder--but the victim was really asking for it. You will probably guess whodunnit, but there is still a lot of fun getting there. Good essence of time and place with the characters being well drawn. A little long, but a speedy reader can handle it."
3,A long book for Miss Silver.,"Maybe I've been reading too many Miss Silver books lately, but I found this book long for the story that was being told. I also got tired of the wishy-washy women that Miss Silver comes across. Althea is lack-lustre character, and Mrs. Blount is almost too cowed to be believed. But there are other good characters in the book. The three Pimm sisters are quite wonderful (your typical English village busybodies). And there is Miss Silver and her dear friend Frank Abbot. A very tiresome woman is found dead in her summerhouse or gazebo, and it's up to Miss Silver to find out the real motive and the real killer. Kind of ho-hum actually, but some of the characters pull this book out of doldrums."
5,Scootering down memory lane.....,"Never thought this would see the light of day on CD. I wore out my viynl copy, back when we were playing at being mods. Secret Affair definately played second fiddle to The Jam, and only because Weller & Co thought of it all first (second time around). This is a wonderful platter, its not angst ridden, a stab at genuine pop music, a nod toward the 60's but original in its concept. As a band they were too clean cut to be taken seriously by the UK music press (and unfortunately, lumped in with the rest of the Mod bandwagon) but play & write they could. From the opening title cut, to the added extra tracks this is well worth the cash, and now they've re-issued the 2 following albums, also worth a listen. An album representative of a period in time when it was truly great to be young...Keep the faith! P.S. The Greatest Hits album is a winner, the best of all 3 releases, sound as a pound..."
2,Disappointing,After all the good reviews I read of this book I thought I would love it. Usually I enjoy biographies. I found that this book is written in a style that makes the story a bit difficult to follow. I gave it my best shot but I did not enjoy it at all.
4,Good Soccer Shoes,This is a good pair of soccer shoes very durable and comfortablegreat sole Black/White have better look.¡¡
4,Comfortable pillow,"This is a very comfortable pillow but it is smaller than I thought it would be. It seems like it is for a kid rather than for an adult. Being from Pacific Coast, it is a very high quality pillow and the microfiber cover is very soft to the touch. A great product, but a little on the small side."
2,Pure luck with no strategy,This game is boring because there's no thinking involved besides doing what the dice say.The game pieces are kind of cute but isn't challenging enough to keep age 6 and up entertained.
2,"So so game for very young kids, parents will be bored to tears","This game is not much fun for kids older than 3, and since it's not intended for children younger than 3 (choking hazard), it's kind of pointless. And since there are so many great games out there that are not only way more educational but WAY more fun for the kids AND you, invest your money elsewhere. For example, the HISSS game (making colorful snakes) by the same company is for young children too and WAY WAY WAY more fun for everyone!"
5,We LOVE this Game!,"When I saw this game in the store, I just had to have it! It was too cute for words! But, when we actually played it I was SO glad I picked it up! My whole family loves this game. Everyone can play it right down to our 3 yr old. If you've ever played Left Center Right (LCR), this game is played much like it, but with mice rather than chips. The concept is cute, the game is quick (15 minutes or less), and everyone has fun. What more could you ask for?!"
4,"love the game, but not the bowl","We received this game as a birthday gift for my 4 year old, and we really enjoy it. My only stink about it is the ""kitty bowl"" which is flimsy and cheap. A real bummer when you have an active kid wanting to play the game; I know I will have to replace the bowl with one of our own soon. That said, the little wooden mice and the dice are sturdy and cute. If we ditch the bowl and put the pieces in a little bag, it could be a good traveling game(restaurant diversion!)."
2,Four year old purrs while I hiss.,"This is a very attractive game. Cool cover art. Neat purple wooden mice and two fun dice with a sleeping cats, dinner bowls, and left pointing arrows. You basically take turns rolling these dice and either: doing nothing, giving a mouse to the player on your left, taking a mouse from the dinner bowl, or putting a mouse in the dinner bowl.That's all there is to it. There is no strategy whatsoever and no where to grow once you master the mechanics of rolling dice and moving mice. My four-year-old has wanted to play it once since we bought it, but to me it's a very tiring ordeal. I envy the cats sleeping on the dice.This game is good for teaching very young children how to take turns and roll dice, but not a whole lot more. Just think that when you buy a game this simple for young children, you will likely have to play it with them, over and over and over."
2,Consider other beginner games first!,"I bought this game for our 4-year-old twins along with a few other beginner games based on other customer reviews. Suffice it to say, this game is quite boring for our entire family. I was expecting something slightly more than put a mouse in the bowl or pass a mouse to the person beside you. The game can drag on and on...ughh. Our boys played it once and that was the end of that!However, they LOVE the other games I bought. They've gotten far more enjoyment out of Hiss, Pirate Pop Up, and Slamwich (we play the simplified version of Slamwich). If you are looking only to teach your kids how to roll dice and take turns (lots of turns) then this game fits the bill. If you are looking for anything that teaches a bit of strategy or has some fun to it, look elsewhere first!"
5,Helpful gadget,I bought this talking compass for my grandfather who is blind. He has enjoyed taking it on his walk to the mailbox in order to make sure he does not get turned around.
4,Good read,this was a book recommended for a class i was taking; it did deliver solid information; good book : comprehensive and inspiring.
2,Poor Packaging/No Warranty,"I purchased another MK315 because I smoked the first one during an electrical storm. I received my Minn Kota MK315 and the first thing I noticed was the poor packaging from AMAZON.com. As heavy as that unit is, they tossed it in a box with a couple of piece of bubble wrap which allowed the unit to beat the outside box and unit box to pieces. Since it was left on my doorstep, wasn't much I could do. Upon installation, the ""Power"" light did not work. Unit seems to charge all three batteries fine. Minn Kota says there is no warranty because I cut the power cord to install in the boat. In their words; ""The MK-315 is a reliable charger. It is unlikely that the charger was defective right out of the box. Unfortunately because the AC plug was altered the warranty is now void. The chargers are a sealed unit and cannot be repaired."" I do believe that will be the last Minn Kota charger I buy!"
5,MinnKota 3 Bank charger!!,Very easy to install. A awesome product. Has really put a very deep charge into my deep cycle batteries. Love this charger!!
5,Makes battery issues a thing of the past.,"I ordered this the first day I got my boat. I had a 2 bank version of this on my last boat and loved it. I see people get to the ramp with a dead battery and fiddle with charging batteries by taking them out after use and putting them on a charger. With this, you can forget all that and just plug it in and forget it."
5,I love this machine,The fuzzy logic rice cooker is amazing. It took me over two years of drooling over it before I finally gave in and bought this two hundred dollar appliance. I am so happy that I did. My kitchen is full of top of the line culinary gadgets and this by far is the best. In frequency of use it comes only second after the panini press. I love this machine. I haven't had rice this good since my trip to Japan in 04. I also love the feature that lets me set the exact time for the rice to be finished.
2,Pan is all scratched after 3 months,"I bought this rice cooker 3 months ago and was very careful to only use the white spoon provided to remove rice/porridge. I only used soft cloth to wash the pan and no dishwasher.However, after 3 months of use, the pan is scratched pretty badly and the coating is coming off. Not sure if I can replace it."
5,Utterly Amazing Quality,"I just bought this thing from Amazon, and once I popped in some sushi rice and it popped out, I could not believe the @#$@#% amazing quality of this thing. It's completely perfect.-Amazing, extremely tasty rice-Easy to clean-Simple to use yet many flexible optionsThings to know before you buy:-The # of cups (not regular measuring cups, but the little plastic cups that come with it) should be equal to the # corresponding to the Water Line for your type of rice in the bowl (NOT cups of water).-If you bought no-wash rice use the green cup, otherwise the clear cup.That's it! It's so delicious and so easy to use. I love it! :D"
4,"Rice is tasty,but...","You need wash & clean the plate under the lid every time.If you put too much water, it will come out from top.45 mins for cooking, a bit long, but you can have the tasty rice finally.I used Korean high pressure rice cooker of my friends', it is about 50 bucks more, but definitely better than this."
5,Excellent Rice Cooker,Great product. Perfect rice every time. Excellent for brown rice. Keeps rice warm. Also does excellent job of cooking grits. Easy to clean. Takes a little longer to cook rice but the flavor is worth the wait. Pricey but great quality. Would highly recommend this product.
2,Too small,very easy overflow. it is not use friendly and have to clear outside very time you use it. Not good!
1,Poorly Made,"The thing made great rice, including brown rice, but that turned out to be beside the point since it completely failed to function after a handful of uses."
3,convenient but not worth the price,I bought this rice cooker after I read other reviews. I can taste the difference the first time I cooked my rice. But I am disappointed after few of use. It provides the some convenience that my old rice cooker doesn't have. But I don't think I would spend that kind of money again for a rice cooker.
2,Do not buy this cooker..,"Bought this a year ago, after it done cook, when it keep warm for few hrs. It started to smell bad."
4,Dumb clock,Rice cooker is all that everyone says about it.GREAT!!!With the one exception. The military 24 hour clock that can't be changed.I don't want my rice at 1700 hours.And oh yes the battery that runs the clock can only be changed by Zojirushi.
2,no-stick layer was chipped after one year of use,"I love the features of this rice cooker. It cooks and re-heat brown rice very well.I purchased the rice cooker last summer and have been used it every day. Yesterday, I noticed that two small spots on inner non-stick layer was chipped. The non-stick outer layer started to chip earlier. I can not believed it happened to this expensive rice cooker that is made in Japan."
4,"Perfect Rice, Quirky User Interface","I'm guessing that for Japanese, this user interface is easier to navigate. For Americans the interface is quirky and the manual is a bit hard to understand, something like all Japanese products used to be when they started to get popular. But once you learn how it works, you can get perfect rice any time and that's worth a lot.The one REALLY annoying thing about this device though is that you can't tell how many minutes are left to cook until it's nearly done. It may be because it doesn't know, but all you have is some time estimates in the manual. This can be a problem in meal planning, but it really does a good job on the rice."
2,too slow!,"We bought this rice cooker because everyone raved about it, but no one seems to have mentioned it's one huge drawback: it takes FOREVER. I tried to make two cups of brown rice this evening. After 75 minutes the water was just beginning to boil. As a working mom, I do not have 2 hours to make rice every evening. Yes, I suppose I could get in the habit of setting up my rice in the morning and setting the timer. But this requires a level of menu commitment I don't presently have. Or, I could go back to our old one-button cheapo machine that cooked white rice in 15 minutes, brown in 30. My husband is Asian, but I'm not. He may like the rice better from this machine, but I'm cooking it and I'm fed up."
2,Not what I expected from Zojirushi product,"I am Asian and I have had many rice cookers of all sizes and quality. I chose Zojirushi brand because of its known name and quality. However, I am surprisingly very disappointed with this rice cooker/warmer. It is actually the worst cooker that I have ever had. It is slow in making rice but the worse is that it can't keep rice warm in the warmer mode. Rice dries up within few hours and its dry as a corn flake by the next day. I am very disappointed and I would not recommend this product.I ordered and replaced inner lid set for my rice cooker (approximately $15 including shipping) which I ordered at Zojirushi website and it seems to be working better and keeping my rice warm and moist."
1,Bought this 2 years ago but has started to fail over an year ago..,"The rice cooker was wonderful when I first started using it. As time went by, it started spit dirty water unto the rice and is now usuable. I have grown up with zojirushi products since I was a baby and ate rice from it 2 out of 3 meals everyday. This rice cooker is crap and I am extremely disappointed, perhaps it is this particular model or the brand that has gone down in quality. I know is that I need to shell out some money to buy another rice cooker:("
4,reliable,This is a gift for my mother but my sister-in-law has been through many rice cookers and this is the only one she will even look at buying.
5,keeps on ticking,"I bought one of these many years ago - at least eight. It still works and does a great job. The battery the keeps the clock going on it has given out, and I haven't figured out how to replace it, so I can't program it for future times, but other than that, no problems."
4,Great product - not fan of front facing buttons,"Great rice cooker. However, not a fan of the front facing buttons. I like some of the other models that had buttons that face more towards the top. The front facing buttons sometimes cause the entire rice cooker to slide back when pushing them. The rubber grips on the bottom help.In general, this is a minor problem and it is a great rice cooker."
1,"Don't buy Neuro Fuzzy Rice Cooker, computer chip problem","This is 2nd one I had in 3 years, same model same problem started to show right after one year. Zojirushi customer service found all kind the excuses not willing to take care of it, they wanted me call service center, which they charging service fee $138- up-front(about the same price for buy a new one)....I will never buy Zojirushi again."
4,"Its a pretty good cooker, just needs more warranty","I have had mine for about over a year now, and it just up and crocked, not sure why. It was faithfull and great for the time I had it, I will miss it, and I am currently awaiting the 3 cup model from zojirushi."
5,Superb Rice!!,"The best rice cooker I've ever owned. I prefer haiga rice,and this does an excellent job. Of course you rarely go wrongwith Zojirushi products."
5,Best Rice Cooker,"Ive owned this rice cooker for around 7 years now and it has worked flawlessly. I have absolutely no complaints and would purchase it again. Ive used this unit in two different states without issue. Ive heard the reviews about the battery but I seem to be lucky as it has never gone out. I just purchased the one pound bread maker and really love it so far, waiting awhile to write the review. I would highly recommend this unit above others."
1,Inner pot peels off!!,"I fell for these great reviews, but found out there is really nothing special about this rice cooker except for the price and the reviews to justify spending more for the same thing.After a couple of months of use, the inner pan peels off, had bad scratches. Talk about the worst customer service.I wish someone I've read a more truthful review on this product prior to buying.Save your money."
1,Less than Impressed,"We purchased the acclaimed, top end NS-ZCC-10 Neuro fuzzy rice cooker. We expected perfect rice because after all it incorporates the latest software and heating technology. We are very disappointed. Rice is overcooked and clumpy. We've tried to troubleshoot (more water, less water etc), but you know, the bottom line is that this cooker does not deliver excellent rice. We got better results with our no-tech, aluminum $50 plug in rice cooker.Very disappointed. I do not recommend you spend your money on this product."
1,Totally disappointed,"Very expensive. Have to read the manual every time for it to work. Got a mind of it own. The lid has to washed every time and there is only one way to screw it back on. If you lose the encyclopedic manual, you are truly toasted. Don't Buy!!! You can get this crap in Chinatown cheaper any way."
4,teflon coating,this uses teflon coating. and Sanyo rice cooker uses titanium coating. why not get the Sanyo instead.
1,What a Joke!,"Wow, after reading all the rave reviews here I expected a great rice cooker. It was anything but...I suppose if I had an hour to wait for my rice it would've proven to be the best rice. 40 minutes plus is the time stated by the directions, I figured cooking one cup would be less, but after 20 minutes the cooker had barely warmed up....I quickly got my ""cheap"" Hamilton cooker ($15) and voila, I had rice a few mintutes later.I'm sure that for those with time or with the time to pre-set cooking time for completion, this is a great machine, but for those that just want to cook some rice quickly and have dinner, don't waste your money. Will be sending this back asap."
2,need very long time to cook,Unless you have soemone at home to press it one hour before meal. Otherwise it takes at least 40 minutes to make rice ready. It is not good for both those couples without enough time for cooking. It take 1 hour and 30 minutes for stick rice. which is crazy for me....
3,Found a REAL STAINLESS Steel Rice cooker,Amazing! This is a genuine REAL FULL stainless steel inner pot rice cooker. Never Peel or rust and easy to use! [...]
1,No Value of Money..,Not worth the money. Takes between 80 and 100 minutes to cook rice. Panasonic Rice Cookers are much better at $49.
4,New rice cooker,"It does take a long time (2hrs) from brown rice, but it does come up perfect. I tried the quick cook and the time was down to about 75 minutes. I did see the same unit in the Food Lion from about $60 less. Should have looked there first."
5,Zojirushi Rice Cooker - Made In Japan,"After I read all the comments about this rice cooker, I purchased it. After I purchased it, I saw a 1 or 2 stars comment that we must take this rice cooker to an authorized dealer to replace the battery. That made me worry a while. My worry is gone now as it cooks perfect rice with this Japan made Zojirushi rice cooker. Also, the menu suggested to leave the electric plug on so no need to replace the battery so soon. But, you must unplug it when cleaning. Anyway, this is a good rice cooker but I puchased it more expensive than Ranch 99 Market. I got it at $175 for 5 1/2 cups on line but Ranch 99 is selling it at $145 for 10 cups. Suggest to look around for a good deal."
4,Works fine.,"We just tried it to cook basmati rice but the rice was slightly harder than we like using the ""normal"" mode. Still testing with different water lever and other mode like ""softer"". We were will to pay more for this ""Made in Japan"" hoping it will be better quality and last longer than the typical ""Made in China"" models. Verdict is still out if it is worth it or not."
5,"Daily Use Very easy to clean, expect to use many years to come","We had been using Zojirushi since day one, because it is the most famous brand among rice eating countries. Our first one is a neuro-Fuzzy, meaning it is very forgiving of the amount of water you measure, or the time you soak the rice, it intelligently figure out and give you the best cooked rice. Our 2nd one was a Inverter Heating(IH) which just like it said, invert DC to AC with frequency control, but it needs a thicker special type of inner. Now it goit some scratches on the inner, after many years of using. This is our 3rd one, and I uses kitchen paper towel to clean the inner (never use anything else like sponge to clean, unless you guarantee your sponge is as soft and dirtless as a new paper towel, so there will be no damage to the inner coating), and it performs perfect, as far as display-wise, my kids loves it, because now the menu selection is in ENGLISH."
4,Zojirushi rice cooker,It does a good job as a rice cooker except it takes a bit long to get the rice cooked.
5,excellant,I use this every day for many years. Recently order inside pot.I also keep 10 cup version at my vacation home.
1,Broke in 10 months.,I was very happy with this rice cooker until the very fragile rubber grommet on the lid tore. They do not sell the part. Beware. It is great but it will not last long this feature makes it very very vulnerable. I had it for 10 months before the fragile grommet tore now it no longer makes good rice. The cost to repair it makes it useless because I would just have to repair it again in 10 months. This is not a rice maker for anyone who cooks a lot of rice it just won't last.
4,What a great difference,"I have used rice cookers for years, but they have always been the one-time and done type of cooker. And, as a result, I would freeze the rice and reheat it over and over to try and save it. This cooker cooked 3 cups of jasmine rice to fluffy perfection, and, just to test it, kept it that way for 4 days! The myriad of options and alarm, timer, and other settings can be a bit daunting at first, but it was well worth the initial frustrations."
5,In almost daily use since Oct 2003 and working perfectly.,"I was poking around looking for a rice cooker for my daughters birthday, and lo and behold, I looked up at the top of the page and it said I bought this in October of 2003.This is the same one I've used almost daily for the last 8+ years and I can tell you it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.I've been through 2 inner pans (the nonstick coating wears off, but those and all other parts are still available) and progressed from simple white rice cooking to now making most of my main meals in it with many ingredients.I've got hundreds of recipes to make rice, pasta, polenta, oatmeal, quinoa, barley, beans, bulgur, or anything that cooks with water and heat, and most all are place ingredients inside, and press cook.A wonderfully reliable little machine that may cost a little more initially, but more than pays for itself in versatility, reliability, and simple no nonsense ease of use."
5,Upgrade of Zojirushi NS-MYC10,"I wanted to submit my review here based on the older model that I had purchased.The perfect rice cooker: Zojirushi NS-MYC10I've had this rice cooker for more than 6yrs and use it to cook rice every single day. It makes 11 cups of cooked rice.The 5.5 cup volume is a little misleading for us Indians. We normally cook rice, rice:water = 1:2 ratio. So basically this rice cooker cooks a max of 3 3/4 cups of rice (using the cup provided).You will be astonished at the difference in taste between the rice cooked here versus some other cooker. I'm not exaggerating as I've two different rice cookers, the other one being Sanyo.I love the fuzzy logic feature where you can cook different rices & porridge's. The delayed time setting is a blessing... when I bought it at the end of 2005, nobody else had the delayed time setting. Obviously there are newer models now.For a family of 4 (2 kids below ages of 8yrs), this is just the perfect size!"
1,"Just after 2.5 years, it is toasted","We bought this 2.5 years ago. It was very good at the beginning. However, just after 2.5 years of light use, it is now toasted. The rice comes out sticky and lumpy and drys up in less than 12 hours. We thought Zojirushi stands for quality and durability. We made a big mistake."
3,Not exactly what I was looking for...,"I got this as a replacement for my 14-year old Korean rice cooker that finally died. Most of the product reviews were positive and I thought this Zojirushi rice cooker would be an ""upgrade"" to my previous low-tech but faithful rice cooker. I've used it for three times now, and I can't seem to have the rice cooked just right. Tried different settings but made no difference. The rice comes out a little dry, and lacks the ""fresh out of the pot"" flavor and texture. It still has many more settings, so I guess I'll have to keep trying...So far, I like the product build quality and all the features, but I'm not really impressed with the rice quality, which is the most important thing for a rice cooker."
4,Rice is nice,"When I first decided to buy a rice cooker I went to my local department store and purchased a small one. WHAT A MESS!!! it went all over the counter, it took longer for clean up then to cook the rice. Well, I returned that brand and started reading bout all the different types of cookers.After I read all the reviews about this rice cooker I decided to give it a tryI am very pleased. It is very consistent no problems.Even the quick cook is good. I cook my brown and white rice and it is perfect each time. I haven't been able to get my steel oats to come out the way I like yet.All in all a good little rice cooker."
5,Cheaper at local Ranch 99 supermarket,"Great Rice cooker. but cheaper selling at the local Ranch 99 Supermarket Store $ 149.Amazon, please consider dropping the price for anyone else looking to buy this"
2,Zojirushi NS-ZCC10 5-1/2-Cup Neuro Fuzzy Rice Cooker,Unfortunately we didn't get to use this as we fell for the old 120 volt appliance into a 240 volt supply. Blew the buggery out of it. Be warned that if you want to use it in Australia it is not dual voltage. A good thing to remember if buying other appliances from America.
1,Not worth the money,The instructions are the worst I have ever seen! Right now I cannot tell if the d@#$ thing is even cooking rice! Buy one of the cheaper cookers and save yourself a lot of headaches!
4,"Delicious rice, still confused about how it works","Pros:- Cooks the most delicious rice, every time (if you figure out the right setting).- Very easy to clean.- Makes a surprisingly large amount of rice for its compact size.- Very convenient warming setting to keep rice warm and moist during long dinner parties.- Cute jingle to let you know its done.Cons:- Not completely intuitive as to how to use it.- If we have to make something other than pre-washed white rice, we have to read the manual very carefully, take our best guess and hope it comes out ok.- Takes at least 45 minutes to make rice, but that's probably why the rice comes out so well every time.- Only displays cooking time remaining once it gets down to 8 minutes so if there's 30 minutes left, you don't really know how much longer because it doesn't say."
5,Induction Heating Model (NH-VBC18),"I have reviewed the latest Zojirushi induction rice cooker (NH-VBC18) under that item. Previously, this new model was not available from Amazon.com but now is.If you are in the market for a superb rice cooker, please read my review. The new model is more expensive (approximately $225) but uses magnetic induction technology to produce even heating throughout the cook cycle. I have gotten excellent brown rice with this new machine."
5,Great cooker,"If you're a brown rice cooker in particular, please buy this product, satisfaction guaranteed. If you want fast rice, stick with Rice-a-roni. But if you want rice to die for buy this product."
4,Isolation repairs a split personality.,"Lots of people beat stress by turning to large bodies of water. They swim, they fish, they daydream on these waters. The Atlantic, the Pacific, the Gulf--they each have calming properties. But our heroine hasn't heard of the healing properties of blue water, so she turns to an isolated cabin practically buried in the snow. Her healing starts when physical pain from the cold snow intrudes on the life of her mind. Each of her split personalities pulls together as she first succombs to her inner pain then triumphs over it. Survival in a snow bound cabin becomes her first priority. The reader is asked to make a tremendous suspension of disbelief in order to accept the heroine's cat with split personalities too. But if you can accept that she talks to herself as one of several personnas, then why not her cat?"
2,Too nervewracking to be enjoyable.,"I'm usually a good judge of which books I'll love, but not this time. My friend warned me that Snow quickly disolves into psychobabble, but was worth reading for the cat antics. Right she was! Perhaps I didn't feel well the day I began reading this annoying book, but within the first 20 pages, I hated it. It was hard to finish, but I was intrigued with the unusual talents the cats displayed, and I kept hoping the story would become less uncomfortable to read. It just had no flow. The subject matter did not bother me, but the way it was written did. I hardly ever read a book I don't want to finish, but this one was a struggle. To the author's credit, I found Vinny and Sophie the cats very charming. Perhaps Ms. Howie's next book will be easier on the nerves."
5,Well designed product,"This is a super camera, and its compatability with Hi8 means all of my old tapes can be viewed. The video resolution is great, and it is loaded with special effects. The viewfinder and 4 inch screen are crisp, variable speed zoom is smooth and the battery life excellent. You should be aware that the video is not true digital. The digital refers to still pictures. Nevertheless, this is a well designed and well thought out product."
3,Doesn't seem to hold air very well,"I got this ball while pregnant, when my poor spine and hips couldn't stand normal chairs anymore.I never used this ball for anything more vigorous than a little gentle bouncing, since i'm bad at sitting still. I used it for no more than an hour or two every day, and never weighed more than 150lbs, so i wasn't traumatizing it. Despite this light use, i had to add air to the ball every few days. It didn't leak dramatically, but after three or four days, i'd notice i was getting closer to the ground than i liked.I had a stability ball from a different manufacturer during my previous pregnancy, and i never had to add air to that one, so i don't feel that i have unrealistic expectations.On a purely aesthetic note, while i see some utility in color-coding the balls by size, it's a bit annoying that my only option in the size i needed was a bright, garish red. I dislike the color, and it attracts small children like flies to honey."
4,I use as a desk chair. HAHA,I use this as a desk chair. I am one of those people at the office you laugh at yes.... but it really helps my back and helps me to do little exercises while I am on the phone.
2,Cant get the stopper to stay,"So excited to get this.. but have tried and tried to get the white stopper to stay where it should. Others have tried as well, but no luck it keeps slipping out. Now maybe I am doing something wrong, but when something which seems simple takes so much energy time and effort, well something is wrong with the product. I have not had the joy of using it yet as it does look strong and of good quality. Sigh."
1,Too Soft - Not firm - Loses Air Quickly - Not good for Chair,"As stated in the subject line, this product may be a good fitness ball but not firm enough to be a chair."
1,"""Professional??""","I ordered this as it was advertized as being professional grade, like what you would expect to find in a good health club gym or the like. This ball seems no different than most others i've seen and used. I'm about 210lbs and when i use the ball for any exercise that involves sitting on it or laying on it the ball changes shape temporarily. When i get off of the ball it's not a ball so much as an orb. it returns to a round shape but for being as sturdy as Go-Fit seems to claim this thing seems to be crap. I'd recommend looking for something that is actually heavy duty if that's what you're needing. There are way too many junk exercise balls on the market and this one is a slightly better than average version. The 75cm size is really large too."
2,Pump broke before finishing the ball,"The pump already looked fishy, it had some remains of contact glue at the top end of the pump. 15 minutes ( 65 cm on the way ) the top part comes off..I guess with contact glue I will be able to fix the pump, still...The ball itself so far holds well, not sure if one is supposed to sit on it when its not fully inflated though..T."
3,It's not purple,"Luckily, the person I bought it for doesn't mind that it's red. I guess it's good otherwise, I don't know. But after reading the reviews from people who complained that it's red, not purple, I actually called Amazon and asked whether that had been fixed. I was assured that it would be purple. So I ordered it, and it was red. Now that might not seem like a big deal, but it's this huge thing that's going to be hanging around the house, so one would hope it were a color one liked. I was going to order one for myself, but now I won't, because I don't want a big huge red thing hanging around. :("
2,Way too soft,"It is possible I got a defective ball, but I bought this with the intention of using it for p90x2. I inflated it following the directions precisely, but I found it nearly impossible to perform most of the exercises because the ball compressed so much. It is very high quality and was nearly odorless, but I highly suggest going for a cheaper ball (I'm now using a TKO ball) that is more firm."
3,These balls have a tendency to lose air.,"I have purchased 3 of these balls, and one continues to lose air. Evidently these balls tend to lose air."
3,GoFit 65cm Professional,"The GoFit Professional Grade Core Stability Ball is a fun, yet challenging way to stretch, tone and tighten your body. What makes the GoFit Core Stability Ball so challenging? Unlike training on a stable, flat surface, the ball is a round, unstable surface, so you not only train the primary muscle groups, but also the smaller stabilizing muscles as well. The stabilizing muscles are small, yet very important muscle groups primarily used for balance, alignment and posture. The ball total body workout is very efficient, allowing you to see the results you want in a much quicker period of time."
1,Sudden Death of a Ball,"The Amazon return period expired on Feb. 7Almost to the day two months later the ball i was comfortably sitting on at worked popped and deflated and landed me on the floor during a business meeting.Embarrassed? A little. Especially because I have been telling everybody int the office hwo great this ball is and how well it works for me.I will return it to Amazon and will send e message to the manufacturer. Fortunately nobody was hurt.I hope the company will replace the ball without any problems, especially since there were no sharp objects involved and I think I am not too heavy at 195 lb.I'll continue writing when I receive a reply from the manufacturer or Amazon."
5,Great Exercise Ball,I bought this to sit on at work. Works awesome. Very durable and the pump it came with works great. Great buy!!
2,too soft,"The GoFit 65cm Professional Stability Ball is not equal in quality to the stability balls at our local gym.The ball seems too soft and pliable. I would investigate other brands, or see what your local gym is usingbefore ordering. ""Professional"" seems to be a bit of a stretch!"
4,GoFit 65cm Professional Stability Ball,"This product is AWESOME! I had purchased a cheaper version (different brand) at Wal-Mart and it deflated daily, it was thin and flimsy material overall it wasn't what I was looking for. I found this Stability Ball here and it is WONDERFUL! The material it's made out of is thick and holds air WAY longer... I think I've had to air it once after receiving it (and I use it daily)! HIGHLY Recommend this product to EVERYONE!"
3,I am too clumsy,"This is a great ball. The problem is I am very clumsy. The first time I fell off the ball I was done. It sits down in the basement.I weigh a little over 200lbs and the ball held my weight fine. It seems to be of very good quality. It has not leaked out any air that I am aware of since I filled it, either."
1,"If I could get it inflated, I could rate it...","I just got the GoFit ball. It came with a handbook with excercise options. An instruction DVD on using the ball, a hand pump and a white plastic piece I assume it related to the pump or plug to the ball. The ball already has a similiar white plug in place. There are NO instructions on how to get the ball inflated. The pump does not fit into where I assume to pump air into it. No matter what Itry I can not get the ball to take any air. If I could inflate the darn ball, I would be able to rate its performance. If you can not get air into it, it is completely useless."
1,"Balls are mislabeled - this is actually a 65cm, that's marked as 75","These balls are excellent. I use one at work as a chair and was buying another for exercise at home. Very good product, but my low rating is due to the fact that Amazon apparently received a batch of balls that are mislabeled. I have 65cm Go Fit balls at home and this 75cm is exactly the same size. My 75cm Go Fit that I have at work is noticeably larger.I've returned this ball once and Amazon (as they always do) gave me excellent customer service and sent out a replacement. Regrettably, the replacement is also a 65cm marked as 75cm."
4,Great Ball,"I love this ball. I use it for workouts, and also my chair for at the desk. I find this to be a very sturdy ball. Inflating it was not very hard. I found that if you can use a air compressor that was much easier than the hand pump. It is a very sturdy ball and not a lot of things stick to it which is nice for around the house. It was also big enough for me to use, I am 6'2 so if your tall this will work for you."
2,Printed exercises on ball? why?,"This ball would get 5 stars, but they decided to print out exercises on the ball itself, turning the nice stick free ball into a swiffer. And since the newly printed part has different rubber than the rest, it will probably become lopsided much quicker than it should. I want to send it back but I really hate returning online purchases."
1,"Ordered 2, both failed the first day",Found the product not to be durable. Both balls split in the first day of use so they seem too fragile for the intended use.
2,Never got round,"My wife loves this ball. She likes its color and thinks it is very sturdy. I, however, think that we have a defective ball. No matter how de/inflated I make the ball, it never becomes a sphere. With the help of a bicycle pump and the enclosed plastic tip I was able to inflate the ball to its recommended 65cm ( I used a tailors tape to measure), but I was far from round. The ball has three 'lobes'. I've read great things about GoFit, so this is probably an anomaly. I would have returned, but my wife doesn't mind."
1,Research this thoroughly before you buy one for an office chair,"I bought this ball to use as an office chair without reading up enough on the matter. I thought it would burn calories and improve posture, but as it turns out the ball really doesn't do much of either. An article at the N Y Times said that according to a 2008 study, performing clerical work at a desk while sitting on an exercise ball burns about four more calories an hour than the same activity in a chair, or roughly only 30 extra calories in a typical workday. And a Dutch study found that the disadvantages, including spinal shrinkage, may outweigh any advantages. All I know is that my back and hip joints hurt after I used this, and the ball didn't work out as an office chair. It might be fine if you want it for other exercise, but that wasn't what I purchased it for."
2,not good quality,I bought this ball because of the cheap price. You get what you pay for. The ball was not the size specified and I could not keep it still. It was thin and not good quality. I have previously owned a different brand and I go to the gym regularly and this ball is awful compared to others! I threw it in the trash.
1,Product is not what is being advertised!,"The ball that had arrived is not the ball that is pictured in the description. It's not even a GoFit brand ball. The product description is not just misleading it's a lie. The ""ball"" isn't even round. It's an oblate spheroid and you can see the drip marks of rubber under a 100W equivalent compact fluorescent light 5+ feet away from the light source. The ball has dark black smudge marks/stains on it. It doesn't look anything like the picture that is used for the item. I will be attempt to get a full refund! This is the actual ball that you will be receiving!gpct203 red is the model that is on the box that this ball came in. The site below shows the same ball with those textured stripes going around it.[...]"
1,Hand pump does not have enough pressure,"Ball is ok, hand pump cannot produce enough pressure to fully inflate ball to proper pressure. Has strong plastic smell even after washing. Would not purchase another one"
5,Perfect for my needs,"Ordered this for doing core training, situps, back hypers, etc. Was fairly easy to inflate with the provided pump. The DVD is okay as it provides a basic blast routine for beginners. Very happy with this purchase and have since purchased the 55 cm as well."
5,Having fun with the ball,"My husband got this ball as an accessory to a workout program he is using. It has served that purpose very well, and also our kids love it. It's pretty big, so to them it's the ultimate toy. I'm happy its anti-burst, and I can see us using it for many years, it is very quality."
1,Not Working As Advertised,We purchased the so called Professional Stability Ball and it has leaked since we received it. The air inlet leaks and make the ball not functional.
1,GoFit 75cm Pro Stability Ball,"The worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon. First it wasn't even the ball I bought. It was a Diff. model than the one shown on the screen. The ball has stupid Cartoon Characters doing exercises on the ball, which I now realize that you show a diif. ball because that one would never sell. Do not buy this ball save your money."
3,Excellent Product Except for the Hand Pump,"This product arrived on time and was in good shape when it arrived. I have used this product and it is very useful and the quality is excellent. The only reason I did not give this product a higher rating was because of the hand pump that was included with the product. Trying to pump up the ball to the required size using this pump is a joke. They should not even send the pump with the product. I finally gave up after following directions ( pump up half way and leave over night and then finish the next day). Pumping up half way was not difficult, but as the pressure in the ball increased the pump became useless. After trying for over two hours the second day, I finally gave up and finshed the job with a portable compressor."
3,didn't last long,"This ball popped suddenly within two months of purchase. I made sure to inflate it correctly, so it was a disappointment when we could no longer use it. It seemed good until then."
4,nice,It is a good equipment for healthy sitting position and exercising. It was a little bit hard to start with it. You will be fine if you leave more time for yourself to get used to it.
5,Stability ball,"Great price, and very fast shipping. The ball was exactly what i was looking for. Unfortunately, the pump broke the first time I used it."
2,Pump broke during first inflation,The cheap plastic pump broke while inflating it for the first time. The ball itself seems fine so far. It's not quite at the recommended circumference because of the pump breaking. I ordered a separate pump to fill it the rest of the way.
2,They really need to improve the pump,"While I think it's a good quality ball, the pump is terrible. Mine broke before it was fully inflated. The thing is about as cheap as they can possibly make it.Very disappointing that they can't provide a higher quality product."
4,good value for the money,We got this ball to help with our daughters physical therapy. It was just what we were looking for.
1,I am angry.,"I ordered this ball. First it get lost in transit. I took my refund and ordered it again. Then the ball came, it writes 75 cm. both on ball and on package but the ball is actually 65 cm. !!! I have measured it with a tape and it rolls through a 65 cm. width area. I`m gonna order this again but only god knows what`ll i get.Also the real problem is; most people do not measure their balls ( LOL ) and with this product coming with a package stating that it is 75 i believe most people use the wrong-sized balls. The reason for me to write this is; i tried to contact their customer services. They do not answer or return to your complains..."
3,Difficult to fill,I use this as a new chair at work. First the hand pump didn't last 5 minutes before it broke and more air leaks out than goes in. I ordered a new pump. I like the color of the ball but I dislike the exercises written on the ball itself. I don't remember seeing that there were written exercises on the ball before I purchased it or I would have bought another. I have had ot put air in it 3 times and I only opened it yesterday. I am hoping thats because it ball is stretching to it actual size.
3,Strong ball but has exercises printed on it,"The ball I received is a red GoFit ball, as advertised. I'll probably keep it, but I was disappointed to find that it has exercises diagrammed all around the circumference of the ball, which looks silly b/c I want to use it as a chair at work. The diagrams aren't in the product pictures, but might be good for someone who wants to use it for exercise."
5,"very durable, and I like the exercise diagrams on the sid","This is much thicker material than my other stability ball - it feels more stable, if you will. It was worth the extra money. I also like the diagrams of exercises around the side. I mostly use it as an office chair at work, but it gives me ideas for the gym."
3,"I'm 5'6"" and the 75cm ball is too big for use as a chair","I purchased the 75cm ball to use as an office desk chair. I'm 5'6"" and when sitting on the ball my feet were several inches above the floor, so couldn't keep a comfortable posture. I am returning this one and ordering the smaller 65cm ball. Also: a pump was not on the list of items included and there was no pump. The ball itself was very well made - giving three stars since the pump was not included."
1,Small,"I wanted to use this as my desk chairNopeIt was too small and was like I was sitting in the floor.Also, the pump they provide is horrible...pleas to be pumping for another 20 min just to inflate."
1,You will not get the color shown,"I compared products and was looking forward to the color purple but received a red ball instead. Amazon offered a partial credit but be warned, if color matters, purple is not what you will get!"
4,Good for the price,"This 4x memory card has 492 pages of memory. The only drawback is that you select the active page with two slide switches. Not bad if you understand binary, but a little hard for 7 year olds."
1,disappointed,i bought it for a play i bought 5 the mislead you thinking the skirt comes with it and the straps arent even sewed on its just a big piece of fabric
1,Huh???,This is very odd. In 1998 Garth Brooks had success when he put out a box set with a similiar theme. However for some artists that kind of treatment doesn't work and it falls flat. I like Toby Keith but this box set is just a way for a record company to make money buy repackaging three CD's (None of which are any good or have any worth) and make an extra buck. It's just sad.
2,Effortless and Misleading,"When I bought this box set, I expected to recieve compact discs that were fully remastered with 24 Bit Technology. Instead, they sound exactly like the original discs I already have. While you may find several top quality country hits in this set, the sound quality isn't up to snuff for today's standards. So now I'm stuck with doubles of everything and out thrity bucks."
2,Toby Keith CD's,"Although the CD's themselves are in fair condition the box in which the set came in is terrible, seperating from its backing the plastic tray which holds the CD's could have at least been re-affixed to the card?"
3,"Inspirational, Yet Repetitive","I would have enjoyed this book more if I had not already read The Prayer of Jabez by Bruce Wilkinson. This version lays out much of the same information, with a few insights for women tucked in. The overall message of both books (which is valuable) is the same. I felt I was reading something that I had already read before. However, the prayer works, as many people have discovered. If you have not read one of the books from this series and you are looking to have a closer walk with God, you will find inspiring information."
4,"An ecletic mix of country, rock, and pop music.","The Beta Band's new release is more than an album, it's an experience. From the first chords of ""Dry the Rain"" to the murmers of ""The House Song,"" listeners will be capitivated, if not a little perplexed. Although the inevitable Beck comparisons could be made, the Beta Band are very different from the country-pop star. Unlike Beck, they produce their own sounds, and their songs certainly aren't anything close to danceable. Yet their county-folk roots shine through, and mix with their rock n' roll power chords, making a truly enjoyable mix of sounds. The lead singer's strong, deep vocals add an edge to the songs, making the Beta Band's U.S. debut one of the most interesting albums of the year. It's one you can listen to again and again, but never hear it exactly the same."
3,Beta Bonus,"I bought this CD on a spree and didn't even know who the band was, I'd never seen high fidelity, I just sorta like the cover. It turned out with the money. Dry the Rain is the best song, in my humble opinion, and needs to be listened to again and again. It's a good CD to chill with."
2,not exactly all that deep or intricate,"well, it's kind of hippy, hoppy, someone learned to play the slide, and i suppose there are some beats on it, but man, it sure is a great big disappointment--this music is not challenging or interesting or even all that different. if you just want something that will go in the background or maybe while you're chemically enhanced, this will do as well as a doors record or something else, but it is not worth any hype at all. it's like low rent version of Arnold or maybe Gomez. they obviously think that they are very cool though. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... hubris......"
5,Meets all expectations,"The Beta Band first came to my notice when I saw ""High Fidelity"". Being intrigued I first picked up the soundtrack, and then this disc. This is a masterful disc. For those listeners who are not adventurous, The Beta Band may not be for you. The band can not be shoehorned into any neat category and the music is 180 degrees from today's incarnation of pop music.Given the previous high marks granted to this disc, ""The Three E.P.'s"" could have been set up for a big fall in my opinion. Happily this proved not to be the case. This disc has become one of my most heavily played discs and will remain so for a long time. Personal favorites are ""Dry The Rain"", ""She's The One"", and ""Needles In My Eyes"".I must have for the musically adventurous!"
4,A new way to discover music,While listen to this EP i found that music as discover a new way to reborn. This guys have made a very original and fascinating mixture of diferent sounds and influences of all kind. Just waiting for the album. Keep on with the good work!!
3,Not bad,"I like the self titled album better. Some really good stuff, particularlythe first few tracks, but also some questionable stuff on there as well."
5,The Beta Band: I can't wait to witness them...,THE BETA BAND is what was good about the Beach Boys and Love & Rockets.
3,"A few great songs, with some filler.....","OK, I admit ""dry the rain"" was one of the big reasons I bought this CD, but other songs like ""the house song"" and ""dogs got a bone"" are pretty good as well. However, some of the more instrumental stuff, like ""monolith,"" doesn't grab me - yet - though I can see it growing on me with time. The variety and the (mostly) mellowness of this CD makes it well worth the price"
4,The closest thing I can compare this to is...,"'Meddle'/'Atom Heart Mother' era Pink Floyd. That's not a bad thing -- that's a good thing (I did say 'Meddle' era, not the later stuff, after all) V-e-r-y atmospheric, v-e-r-y psychedelic. Oh, I know, it's probably neither of those things to a lot of you, but that's MY take on this collection. And it's probably a reference more people can relate to than obscure/British bands a lot of people have never heard of. Hey, I LIKE this cd. But I didn't find it groundbreaking. It's simply tilling some ground that hasn't been harvested in a while."
5,This is your brain talking - 'BUY THIS ALBUM',Beck meets the Stones . . . the party starts there . . . by the time the everyone's feeling comfortable with their cocktails . . . Primal Scream drops in for a righteous time. Beg Borrow or steal - Beta Band rocks with some originality of their own and some originality of their early brethen. Probally sound as good in your garage as they do on this album.
5,Balm for wounded ears,"If you think that today's young musicians only make hardcore, ska, punk and other kind of noises, you must change your mind right now. Listen to this record, made by four art students. It's delicate, involving, vibrant, at the same time. The first E.P., ""Champion Versions"", is sublime and the best of them; the third one, ""Los Amigos del Beta Bandidos"", is excellent; the second one, ""The Patty Pattty Sound"", is less inspirated than the other two, but pretty good too. In my opinion, the highlights are ""Dry the Rain"", ""B+A"" and ""It's Over""."
4,stoner rock!,"i feel guilty listening to this, due to the fact that i have short hair. but it's great stuff. the beta band has succeeded in setting the wild rumblings of the baked mind to music. (if you actually understood that last sentence, you'll love this album....)."
5,High Fidelity did the band a disservice?,"How can one say that a small, underappreciated, terrific band was done a disservice by having their music disseminated by a fairly good movie soundtrack? Dry the rain happens to be a great song that isn't necessarily in the same vein as monolith, but a good representation of the band nonetheless. After all, the band wrote it, recorded it, and made it the A side to their first EP. So who cares if their latest albums are more spacey, less poppy. The fact of the matter is, all of their output, including Dry the Rain, is amazing and interesting and innovative. To whoever is reading this 'review' - buy everything you can find by The Beta Band - it's worth it. And don't listen to those who seem to think this music is esoteric and above those who were initiated through Dry the Rain. I bet a good deal of those fans wound up loving the crazy and out stuff the band has to offer as much as the popcraft."
1,Disappointing,"This review is for people possibly looking into the Beta Band because of their single on the High Fidelity soundtrack. Drying the Rain is a great song, but unfortunately the formula that makes it a great song does not carry over to the rest of the album. It really is just a bunch of noise. Main stream music fans should pass this up and stick to the soundtrack. Trust Me."
2,Learning how different tastes are,"This CD isn't bad if you like repetitive lyrical phrases without meaning, looping samples, speech that repeats and says nothing (like ""pushin' out"" over and over and over and over again). I can perceive some talent somewhere in here, but this group is making music CDs that mostly lack music. Where's the music?Some songs start, seem to have potential to develop into something, and then don't. Now, having said all that, there are a few worthwhile cuts, a couple that are quite good. So ultimately, if you like to have more music than incoherent mixes of various sounds, then you have simply to decide whether or not you're willing to pay $3 or $4 a cut.I'll admit: maybe I just don't get it, but if you can find a place to sample everything on this album I think you'll find I'm vindicated."
5,"The ""Prince of Preachers"" tells it like it is!","""My college lectures are colloquial, familiar, full of anecdote, and often humorous; they are purposely made so, to suit the occasion. At the end of the week I meet the students, and find them weary . . . and only in a condition to receive something which will attract and secure their attention, and fire their hearts.""So starts this timeless collection of lectures that the ""Prince of Preachers"" presented with insight, humor and passion to aspiring ministers.Fascinating titles include ""The Minister's Fainting Fits""; ""Posture, Action, Gesture, etc.""; and ""On the Choice of a Text,"" there are 28 of Spurgeon's classroom discourses on homiletics. Topics include the call, open-air preaching, ordinary conversations, using illustrations, and conduct outside the church, Amazingly powerful and practical over 100 years after the last lecture was delivered."
5,"Must read for all pastors, especially for aspiring pastors","Absolutely every subject that a pastor needs to cover in regards to his salvation, personal life, and pulpit ministry is covered extensively in this compilation of Spurgeon's various lectures at the Pastor's College. If you feel the call to the ministry, this will strengthen you if you are truly called. If gives a real glimpse into the life of a devoted preacher and contains exceptional examples from Spurgeon's life. Awesome read."
5,Inspiration for enriching ministry.,"I am using the book ""Lectures to my Students"" by C. H. Spurgeon in my Homelitics class. Spurgeon's insights have enlarged my horizions as to how I read and analyse The Holy Scriptures. The book has enhanced my teaching greatly."
2,Tiny Print,"Seller did a great job getting this to me in a timely fashion, no complaints there; however, the text within the book is terribly small, looks like someone zoomed out and then printed all the pages, they don't even fill the page normally (2 inch margins on the left and right and 3-5 inch margins on the top and bottom). Was excited to get the book, but not very excited about the print size"
1,A wonderful teaching aid,"This is one of the most helpful books for teaching that I have found. Spurgeon is known as ""Prince of Preachers"" and he really is a great teacher. I an certanly thankful He left some of his work for us to use. His ancedotes are great."
1,THIS IS AN ABRIGED EDITION - PLUS IN VERY SMALL PRINT,This is an abriged edition (although it says unabriged in the product description) and the print is VERY small.
1,Great content...Poor format,"These are great lectures by Spurgeon, but the format of the book is very poor. It is a photo reproduction of one of the original editions and the type is VERY small and hard to read. There are other editions, Eerdmans for example, that are much better for a similar price."
5,Fascinating History Of A Unique Time And Place,"If this was a fictional account about the section of New Orleans called ""Storyville,"" no one would ever believe it. That it is true is wonderful, monstrous, fascinating, horrible, and damn good reading. The birthplace of blues, jazz, Dixieland and the beginning of the ""Black take"" on music that has swept the world and reinvented itself many times...right up to the present. The sex in this book and the way it was practiced and viewed at the time is unbelievable; it boggles the mind. This book cries out to be the basis for a movie, a musical, and/or a TV series. The cast of characters defies explanation. If this book doesn't blow your mind, you don't have one. Great!"
3,An Interesting Collection,"Be warned that this is a one-CD collection: the second disc listed on the liner notes is not included. The songs that are part of the collection run the gamut, all of them representative of the Salsoul stable of artists. Innocent soul-oriented dance songs like ""Dr. Love"" sit side by side with the gospel-inflected pop projects of Loleatta Holloway (""Hit and Run,"" ""Runaway""). Included are a great remix of ""I Got My Mind Made Up"" and original versions of Inner Life's ""Moment of My Life"" and Love Committee's ""Just As Long As I Got You."" The incredible Walter Gibbons remix of the latter song is available on the Forever Disco CD."
4,Slowdive meets Radiohead,"Very nice couple of songs. ""Winternight"" sounds like early Radiohead or Catherine Wheel with a slight Slowdive atmospheric sound in the background. A nice mix. ""Jumble Sailing"" has kind of the same atmospheric sound to it, but is a cute pop song. Too bad their album ""Lido"" isn't all like this."
2,It was good while it lasted...,"The device worked wonderfully when it worked. Unfortunately for myself, it died after only two weeks of light use. Your mileage may vary."
3,"Great for the size, but average for the sound","I've had my AX2 now for about two weeks. So far, I really like it for it's size and weight. It's small enough so that I don't look like the Borg (Star Trek) when wearing it, and I don't feel any weight on my ear. I got used to the ""antenna"" used to hold it in place almost immediately. But unfortunately, the sound quality could be better. The speaker inside the earpiece delivers a lot of treble with little bass. Inside this seems to be okay, but outside I've had to ask my girlfriend to repeat statements a lot. If you plan to use the AX2 indoors, I'd definitely recommend it. But if you're looking for a bluetooth headset for outdoors, I might consider looking at other brands with better overall sound quality."
4,Excellent headset but you should baby the battery.,"After having owned 3 different headsets I can safely say this has been the best for me. Sound quality is excellent and it is the only one I can effectively use in the car on the highway, others are just not loud enough. A tip I would offer is to not leave it in your car, the cold weather killed the battery and not I am left with a, very light, paper weight. Replacement batteries are $20."
4,signal not very good,"i ended up not using it that often. great in the car, and near distance.however, compare to the cell phone signal, it has some low level noise.you can still continue the conversation, however..."
3,AX2 Bluetooth headset,"I got this headset at a real low price. reception is good as long as you are carrying phone in your pocket or it is closeby. very light weight and once you get accoustomed to wearing it, it is easy to fit in the ear."
2,Quick Tip,When I first got my Bluetooth device I was very happy because it is compact and very useful when driving.After a month I started getting a lot of static and even thought I had my cel on my belt.
3,Average headset,"When I first received this I thought that it was cheap feeling and I really didn't like it. I had a blue tooth heavy duty motorolla before, which felt more high quality. I now have grown to like this item. I don't like how you have to turn it on and off all the time. I wish there was an easier way. You have to hold down the button for 3 seconds. Sometimes there is static on the other end. The battery life is okay. Nothing spectacular. Overall I'd give this an average score."
4,ok,you still feel confined to the phone because you can only get about 10ft away from the phone before it starts getting static!
2,"""You Get What You Pay For""!","I have purchased several bluetooth headsets in my attempt to obtain a good quality sound. I purchased the Nextlink AX2 with the hopes of solving my search. I was not impressed. It was loud enough (as they stated), but with the volume turned up it created an echo for the recipient of the call. It is a ROYAL pain trying to get the thing in your ear while driving. Once in, it was fine. I hung up on several calls while attempting to secure it in my ear.I have put the whole thing back in the package and will try to return (though for the $30 less shipping both ways) it probably isn't worth my time.I have gone to the expensive H700 MotorolaAs they say -""you get what you pay for"""
1,waste of money,"the earpiece is a waste of money, gave it as a christmas gift, but shouldn't have. It's a toy, very low volume, you cannot hear and cannot be heard!!!Could not return it because I lost the receipt...Total Waste!!"
1,Not durable at all...move on to another headset,"I had this headset for 3 days. Dropped it from waist level and now it doesn't work. I could have gotten better use out of $30 by purchasing a fairly decent bottle of wine...it would be gone too, but I would have had more enjoyment out of it. This unit is very small, and getting it into the ear is awkward, and is impossible to do without pressing one of the volume up/down buttons, which means you will have to re-adjust. If you have larger hands, like I do, it is a little odd to handle...hence, the greater possibility of it being dropped. The sound was mediocre at best, and everyone I spoke to (in the short 3 days that it did work) said there was an echo on their end. Not recommended. Move on to another."
3,good voice quality but very fragile,really good voice quality and weightless - but whats the use if it would last only for a week - this thing cracked open in a week of usage and would not work.
2,"Nu Stylz, lol","Anyone else think it's hilarious that they have this imaginary group nu stylz? I mean, it's nsync, everyone can tell (right?). Well, about this CD, I wouldn't reccomend it. If you're an nsync fan you HAVE all these songs. Although it is only five bucks, so if you like these songs but don't have their album it's worth it. Hope it helps. Don't you think it's weird though, nu stylz, nsync... weird."
2,A little disappointing,"I wasn't too happy when I got this book in the mail. It simply does not have very much material, even for a baby. All my granddaughters teach their children simple signing starting at a few months and pre-verbal signing is great for eliminating much of the frustration of not being able to express themselves, but it seems to me that the pictures in this book would be difficult for them to catch on to. Obviously, the adult would need to teach the signs but I don't think they would be able to recognize them from the pictures after they learned them."
4,Fast becoming one of baby's favourites!,"""Get your fingers ready to twinkle...""That's how storytime begins with this book, which will encourage active participation even in babies who aren't signing.Very cute pictures of babies and helpful captions for parents on the pictures of signs make this a book you will enjoy together again and again.The series is slightly inconsistent in that only one book - Itsy Bitsy Spider - features a lovely REVIEW of signs on the back page (maybe they had an extra page because that song is short?). I found the review very helpful, and wished the other books in the series had one, too...it gives the baby yet another signing sing-along opportunity!Still, I think Twinkle Twinkle is her favourite of all these books, and we have had many MANY requests to read it in just the few weeks it's been here.Recommended for ages 1-2 only, as it's a very basic song that older toddlers will probably not sit still for for long."
3,"Very simple, little disappointing, but my 2 year old enjoys...",I bought this book because my son loves to sing Twinkle Twinkle before bed. I was a bit disappointed with how simple & short the book is but my son does pick it up from time to time... he enjoys the hand-drawn illustrations of the other kids & following along since he knows the words by heart.
5,Reebok Women's DMX,These are absolutely the best walking shoes. My husband and I walk 4 miles every morning and I have tried all different kinds of shoes. The Reebok DMX is the most comfortable and I would recommend it to any serious walker.
2,Disappointing Follow up .........,"The book is definately a disappointing follow-up from Mail Order Bride. Its so hard to like Annie, who is out for herself and very immature. Usually in historical romances a 20 year old is a little more mature. So it makes it difficult to root for her and Colin, when all you want to do is smack her in the head.I love Maureen McKade's books, and I would tell you to read this, just to get closure from the whole Trevelyan tale. But man oh man, Kate and Trev raised a brat!!!!!! I expected way better. Sorry, Ms. Mckade..."
4,NOT THE BEST BUT A GOOD FOLLOW UP!,"Face it, Annie Trevelyn is a spoiled brat, progessive thinking for her day or is she trying to rebel by being shocking. She is very naive or just ignores her father's knowledge that actress usually end up being kept by some man. He didn't want that for his child.The problem is that she is not a very lovable brat at that. And Colin McBride or ""Laddie"" as Trev knew him wasn't exactly interested in that kind of wife. Colin, at thirty two, should have been a bit smarter than to trust her. And to get into trouble by befriending her actor troup, wow!But let's face it - she is the personification of many of todays kids - I guess there are some in all generations. [grin]I will admit to being supprised at who turned out to be the villian - I never guessedRecommended --M [with questions] but I did love finding out about Kate and Trev's extended family."
1,Our unexpected wasted time,I am a very big Maureen McKade Fan . I have got 2 of every book that she has . I waited so long to read this one . But when I got it I sat down to read it and I have to say I was crying at the end becuse it was so painful to read . It was a very disapointing night . This is one book that I will not be keeping :-( It was very laging in many areas . Along with unbelivable . I am usally able to loose my self in her books and forget any kind of day the world has put me threw but not this one. You know it a great book if you laugh and rut on the people in it but this one you sipmly can not.
3,Great for fans,"This is a good book, but then again it's the only one ever written about Freddie Prinze, Sr. I agree that there are alot of things left out of this book, which sort of leaves you scratching your head. Maybe the book was written in a hurry in an effort to put out some truth. It would have been nice to have a more well rounded story of what Freddie's life was like growing up, which would have included more information about his father and other aspects of his life. Also, there wasn't that much information on Freddie's then wife Kathy. It would have been nice to have had her input, but as the book stated, it was about a mother and son. I really wish someone would write a more detailed account of Freddie's life, he's missed alot, and many of the fans would enjoy it. If you are debating on getting this book, I would recommend reading it, of course it's sad, but you do get a glimpse of what Freddie was all about, through his mother's eyes."
5,To a very special comedian who is missed.,I enjoyed reading this book written by his mom. It gave me insight into the way Freddie was raised and how he was when he was younger. One thing Freddie had... he was a gifted comedian. I read this book probably 8 years ago and I still cherish my copy. I thank his Mom for writing it and for giving his loyal fans a bit of comfort by hearing her side of the story. God bless her.
5,The Best,I love this CD. Out of all his music that I own this is my favorite. Great diversity of songs. Really shows what he can do. I don't know how you couldn't like it if you like Nelly.
1,here we go again!,"holy crap once again this faggot NElly comes out with a horrible album, omg dont get this, paul wall song is whack, the only good song to listen to is Nasty Girl. Nelly is still whack and always will be, listen to true rappers like NWA, Nas, Eminem, Dre, not these bubble gum rappers like Mike Jones, slim thug etc.Seems to me like hip hop is getting worse and worse every year, where the days where people would talk about important things rather then cars and girls.This nelly guy collaborated with NSync WTF!! and Tim Mcgraw also WTF! XTINA, Fat Joe, Lil Flip all horrible people and yet he does it. I dont think he cares about what his fans think, wish he wouldve stuck with something like Country Grammer only thing but this CD is just horrible dont get it!(...)"
1,Manufactured garbage re-packaged,"Sweat and Suit were two of the absolute worst albums of last year. Sadly, both of those disasters are being re-packaged and released again. Everything on here is just terrible. ""Grillz"" is also one of the worst songs I've ever heard all year. It figures that only Nelly would make a stupid song about his diamond teeth. It also figures he'd make a song with that horrible H-Town rapper Paul Wall. I blame Nelly for the state of hip hop today. He also created hip-pop which is one of the worst music genres ever created. Hell Cash Money and G-Unit make better club songs than this idiot. One of the year's absolute worst albums."
1,Holy Canoli! 2 Crappy albums for the price of 1!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Nelly sucks, we all know that's a fact. I'm glad the legendary KRS-ONE pulled his b!tch card, Nelly's feelings got hurt when he heard one of the pioneers tell him that he sucks. If nelly was a fat guy with a gheri curl he wouldn't sell any albums, since he's a fair-skinned, muscle bound tool, he sells. He seems to model himself after LL Cool J, who also sucks and had 1 good song his whole career. Don't encourage artists like Nelly by purchasing their records, it only insults the hip-hop community, which you probably would never understand if you're listening to this crap."
1,Simply wack.,"Nelly is garbage. Which explains why this album, now combined, didn't do anything on the charts. Even when they came out the first time, he only sold about 3 or 4 million combined. Nobody is feeling him anymore. Maybe the women will still buy his stuff but I doubt it. He is officially wack. Don't buy this."
5,"Nelly, Nelly Nelly",What can I say? I love this cd because it has all my favorite songs from sweat & suit on one cd. I don't have to take one cd out to hear songs from the other cd. Plus i love the fact it has my favorite song on there with Murphy Lee (he needs to drop a new cd) River Don't Runnn. I love the new single Grillz. Way to go Nelly.
5,Nelly's the man again,Nelly's cd's are always hot. I really like Suit. Sweat is cool. Nelly keep doing what you do.
2,Another Greatest Hits!,"When Nelly released ""Sweat"" and ""Suit"" about a year ago, it was met with unpleasant reviews and sales. But, somehow, ""Suit"" tended to sell more than what ""Sweat"" could afford. So, to make the wrongs right again, Nelly felt that it was possible to rerelease the album and just make ""one"" whole album. Well, it is a little too late for that. 14 songs made the cut from both albums, which include ""Over and Over"", ""My Place"", ""Heart of a Champion"", and ""Na-na-na"". Along with these songs, are three brand new songs, including the hit single ""Grillz"" with Paul Wall, Big Gipp & Ali of St. Lunatics. However, even with these songs, it does not help with what has been damage already. This seems more as a ""Greatest Hits"" between the two albums. So, if you are debating which two albums to buy, either ""Sweat"" or ""Suit"", just buy this cd. But, if your expecting something new and exciting with this album, you will probably be disappointed."
2,this cd blowz,"the only reason that this gets 2 stars is because of the people champ's (paul wall) line ""call me george foreman cuz im sellin everybody grillz"" other than that this cd sucks"
1,a ripoff nelly's running out of ideas,first this was 2 separate cd's a good way for nelly to make money since nelly can't come up with new song ideas he decided to put the best songs on both albums and combine them and call it sweatsuit boy nelly you sure are a jackass for doing this good matrketing skills every song on here sucks just like sweat and suit did nelly fell off after country grammar he lost his edge doing songs with pisstina aguilera and even tim mcgraw's weak ass you gonna do country keep it hood idiot.
5,THIS CD IS GOOD,I love the SweatSuit new cd it is so good.I guarante you'll like atleast 6-8 songs off this ablum.Please support Nelly be getting this ablum.
5,it's nelly cd so it the the best,if you haven't brought the cd yet what are you waiting for.i have his two other cd and i just brought the new and i can't get enough of them i play it over and over again . nelly is the best
5,The new SweatSuit,Nellys new album SweatSuit is a combination of his older albums Sweat and Suit with 3 nwew tracks on it. i love this album because nelly always has something new and fresh to say. If you love nelly you will love this album.
3,"nelly ""sweatsuit""","I LIKE THE NEW NELLY CD.I LOVE NELLY. I HAVE ALL OF NELLY'S CDS.MY FAVORITE SONGS ON THE NEW NELLY CD ARE GRILLZ,NA-NANA-NA,FLAP YOUR WINGS,MY PLACE,TILT YA HEAD BACK,AND MANY MORE.I SUGGEST U GO PICK UP THE ALBUM IF U R REALLY A NELLY FAN."
1,I usually give good reviews...,"From a white alpha male:I concur with the others who don't like this release from Nelly. I like much of his earlier stuff, solo & with the talented St. Lunatics crew...I love STL!Nelly buddy Murphy Lee's Law 2003 album is Jammin all the way!!...has not one crappy tune.Maybe Nelly should retire from rap, just be cool, open a restaurant or strip club, manage & direct new female R&B; groups...or start a funky jazz outfit, ala Brand New Heavies or Incognito."
1,Dehydrated.........dying rapidly.,"Listening to this album is just like putting on the thickest sweatsuit you can find and going for a really long run in africa. Dehydrated and dying rapidly. Nelly helps with this dehydration of hip hop by constantly creating infantile BS songs. I am sick of this monotonous, commercial, ignorant so called ""hip hop"". When will the zombies and sheep get tired of hearing the same song over and over and over again? Avoid this rehash of Sweat and suit as if it is a newly found strand of AIDS. Shakespeare?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?! WTF!!!!!!!!! LOL......if shakespeare wrote his plays like nelly writes his lyrics, the masses would've first stoned him to the point of death and then burned him at the stake."
3,Newest from a Brazilian master,"Moacir Santos is a master composer, arranger and saxophonist. His shore is Brazilian Jazz with a combo comprising rhythm section + brass in a unique combination which is consistently applied to such original and unconventional compositions.In the late 60s, Santos went to live in the USA where he's recorded three albums for Blue Note Records. He also became an auxiliary writer for some great arranger just like Billy Byers was to Quincy Jones.This is his 2005 album, a totally new collection of fresh music, good music but neglectable music though played by the best Brazilian musicians in the area.Wynton Marsalis plays a sensational solo in the album's best track."
1,"Broke after 5 years of light use, see one of the images, bike damaged","One of the legs broke in two, the bike flew off the rack on a highway at 70mph, damaged beyond repair. Don't get this plastic piece of crap. Look at the image, its hollow inside, there is no reinforcement of any kind."
2,Difficult & Disappointing Product,"Very difficult product to adjust & strap onto the trunk of a car.The clips used for attaching to the trunk actually scratched the paint on my car. I do not recommend unless you have a lot of patience to install for each bike ride.On the flip side, it is made of very durable material & is weather resistant."
4,Bones 3-Bike,"I bought this rack to halt 2 bikes most of the time, and for this task the rack does a phenomenal job. With 3 bikes however, I find the spacing is a bit tight. I have a Subaru Forester hence it is easy to put the rack at the back without folding it. But for a smaller car folding the rack and expand it again can be a 5 minutes job."
4,Solid bike rack.,"You will not be disappointed with the construction of the bike rack. It's made from very strong and light material that doesn't rust. It fit perfectly on my SUV. I placed 2 bikes on it and drove 70mph on the freeway without a problem. When I stopped to check the bikes, all the tie cables were still tightly fastened and both bikes were in proper placement.There are a couple of downsides however. You might find it difficult to place 3 bikes on there. Also if you own a women's bike, it will sit on the rack at an angle. When it sits at an angle, it makes it difficult to get the third clamp (stabilizer) fastened."
5,Awesome Bike Rack,"Very practical, solid. Not the quickest to install or take off, but very easy to use. Good quality materials and workmanship."
5,Saris Bones 801 3-bike,proeasy to mount and easy to move to another vehiclesolid with no wiggle during drivinglooks like it came with vehiclecon3rd bike position appears to add excessive bending moment to mountstrap buckles take a lot of effort to attach and removedoes not compact easily for storagestill need two other straps to prevent wheels from turning
5,Outstanding bike rack,"I've tried all kinds of bike racks over the years - including a very expensive Thule roof rack (don't even get me started) - and this one is hands down the best of them all. It is easy to set up, easy to adjust, and easy to put it on or take it off your car. It stays in place, holds the bike securely, and best of all, it holds the bike away from the car so it won't smash against your trunk or bumper and damage your car. I use mine all the time on my sedan and on my minivan and I've never had any trouble with it at all. All it takes is a simple adjustment to make it fit either vehicle perfectly."
1,"Broke 3rd time out, destroyed back of Prius","We bought this for our Prius only a few months ago, the third time out, the strap broke sometime during our drive and dented the hatch and bumper badly (the bikes hung on til we pulled over). Thousands in damage, don't know if Saris is going to help with the damage but BUYER BEWARE!! 2 adult and one kid bike. Terrible terrible rack."
5,Great Bike Rack,"I did a lot of shopping around before making this purchase and I was not disappointed. On a recent 700-mile road trip, our two bikes were safe and secure; they never shifted nor slid despite rain, high winds, and lots of passing trucks. Bravo Bones!!"
2,Not for an Outback Wagon,"I've seen this on trunklids, with bikes or without: appears sturdy and appropriate. Fine.As for use at the back of a wagon, specifically an Outback, it simply doesn't fit. The side straps don't grab at a good angle because of the interior plastic connected to the hatch. The top straps can't get an easy grab on the metal (even with recommended $20 extra) without bending and threatening to break the back-up light assembly which are positioned above the rear glass.If you have an Outback, go for a roof rack solution, or spend the $ on a trailer hitch, I suppose."
3,Dissapointed,"I decided to get a hitch for my Honda Civic (and a hitch mounted rack).I saw the reviews for Bone 2 and 3 and since it had so many good reviews I purchased a rack. The rack arrived and it seemed used because the PLASTIC screws threadings were damaged. The overall build quality was good except the plastic screws and perhaps my vehicle was not too accommodating of the Saris design. If you have a small vehicle, please read your manual to find out what weight your rear bumper can support because the ""fasteners"" (or bolts) holding fenders and bumpers are not as strong as you may think (because newer cars do not have metal bumpers or metal bolts)."
5,Does not fit Honda Odyssey 2011,Looks like a nice rack; too bad they didn't make it clear that it DOES NOT FIT THE 2011 Honda Odyssey before I ordered the rack and had to send it back. The plastic faring on the top of the rear hatch is the problem.
1,Hate it,"We hate this thing. Hate. Hate. Hate.Even though it is supposed to hold three bikes, we can't even get two bikes on it, they are so squished together.Every time we try to use it, we just get covered in grease, angry, and abandon all hope of ever riding bikes somewhere that is not at home.Foaming raging hatred."
2,meh,Carries bikes alright. Would expect some better quality for a trunk bike rack >$140. Screws to hold arms in place are cheap plastic and strip out very easliy. There's some other small problems with the carrier. I would expect more for how much it cost. This carrier is more form over functionality. Save your money and get a $60 rack that will work just as good but not be as pretty.
3,Arrived Broken,"Amazon's customer service was great in returning the item but it arrived broken. One of the plastic pieces was broken. I am planning on ordering another one, but it looks like the price has gone up."
1,Dissappointing,"Purchased this bike rack after visiting the Saris website and searching for a bike rack that could be used with a VW Beetle and Toyota 4Runner. The rack arrived in a timely manner but.........instructions were vague and hard to follow. My husband and I spent a couple of hours trying to install the rack & 2 bicycles onto the 4Runner. We could get the rack on - tight & secure - but the weight of the bicycles caused the upper legs to pull away from the rear window. We finally gave up and returned the rack to Amazon. In addition, no way could the rack be used on the VW - straps and metal clips would have to be attached to glass which the instructions clearly said should not happen. I consider my husband & I to be reasonably intelligent but possible that there was something we failed to do????????A positive....Amazon paid for return shipping and credited my credit card - no questions asked."
4,Good Basic Rack.,"Good, solid rack for shorter trips. After the first time you install it, it becomes very easy to install and remove (3 to 4 minutes to install and less than 1 minute to remove). On a sedan you can leave it on, but on a SUV you have to take it off to get access to the back. The instruction talks of S-Hooks, but the two I've bought do not have S-hooks, which makes it harder to remove the hooks after installation. If you want to take your bikes across country look at hitch-racks.Also, when I bought this rack there was one other review in this space and it was negative. 3 days later and that review has been removed!!It would leave a bad taste in my mouth if I thought Amazon was removing negative reviews just to sell more products."
5,Sarius Bones and Prius2006,"I purchased this rack to use on a new PRIUS. Works as it should. Lightweight, well padded and strong. Carried two bikes without a hitch (pun). No problems with the padded feet on the rear glass."
3,A little crowded,"This was our first bike rack - we chose it based on customer reviews and the reputation of Saris. I liked it before we put it on the car - it's solid and the strap system is very secure. Mounting the rack onto the car was very straightforward. But... it took forever to get all 3 bikes on! The mounts are so close together that pedals were jamming into wheels, handlebars were jamming into seats, etc. One of our bikes is a child bike - if it weren't, I'm not convinced that we would have been able to mount all three. I suspect that this is a common problem. It would have been helpful if the mounting instructions included some tips for positioning things.We also dented the back of the trunk door the first time we used the rack. Since then, we've positioned it lower so it pushes on the fender, and have not had any trouble. But again, a note about this in the instructions would have been nice."
5,Perfect for my 08 PRIUS,"This was the third rack I tried on my Prius. Although, it doesn't specifically say it will work, online reviews on the prius boards made me believe this was the best choice and it was. Simple to use, great website with video so its impossible to make a mistake. A part was broken when I recieved my rack , called Saris and they immeadiately put a replacement as well as 2 spares in the mail. Have only used with 2 bikes but it works great & looks awesome on my red car."
2,Design flaw; ties tear along the sharp cylinder edge,"This rack is sturdy as long as it worked. I bought this rack just about 4 months ago. I had it mounted on my car all this time. There is a thin hard plastic ring with a very thin lip that goes on the inside of the cylinder to protect the nylon ties from rubbing and tearing at the edge of the cylinder, which is very sharp. So today the plastic ring cracked (probably from temperature drop to 60s over the last few days from 90s the week before) and one of the two main nylon ties, which clips to the back of the trunk lid of the car, tore by cutting along the edge of the cylinder. So I think this is a design flaw - either the plastic ring could have been thicker or the edges of the ridged cylinder could be smoother and not so razor sharp."
4,"Plastic good, metal bad","I love everything about the Saris Bones--especially the bright red that matches my car!--except the metal clamps that clip onto the trunk at 6 points. There's bound to be a better way to keep them from scratching the paint than my solution of wrapping them in Saran Wrap. Otherwise, it's easy to mount, holds the bikes securely, and did i mention it matches my car perfectly?"
4,Good Rack,"This is very good for people looking for a great rack to use for your bikes, It fitts great on my car. One problom i had was that it's a pain having to put the bikes on, because it doesn't fit three 20 inch BMX bikes as well as i thought it would but they will fight once you put a little elbow greese to it . But It's all good!"
2,Not good for full suspension bikes.,"The reviews in Amazon made me decide to buy this bike rack but now that I have it, it is obviously an over-rated product.The extending arms that hold the bike are thick especially towards the end which make it hard to fit a bike properly.I have a full suspension bike and even though I bought the extra bar to go between the seat and the handlebars, it is not very easy to put on and definitely doesn't feel safe (the bike is hanging by the seat which is not a fixed part.)The seat post strap is a nice feature but is also cumbersome.As far as the plastic, it's good to have the material of the rack softer than the bike so that in case of a bang you don't damage the bike.After using it for a few weeks I found that it is easier to put the bike on in reverse with the seat post strap towards the lower bar."
3,Around town only,this bike rack is ok they don't tell you up front that it is unsteady above 65mph. I had to bikes on and it was rocking back and forth like crazy so I added 3 extra heavy duty tie down straps since I was driving half way across the country on a two week trip. If you going to use it around town its ok but I would not recommend it at all for interstate driving unless you can rig up your own extra straps.
3,not sure yet,I am half way through the second bottle of this . I am not sure if it will help with aches and pains but my skin and body feel and look good.
3,It must be too old.,"I've never seen the video, but the rating in the review by the lady above doesn't seem justified. She doesn't make any sense. Equipment has changed dramatically in the last 13 years. Technique has changed too."
5,Excellent Opera for the Holidays,Giancarlo Menotti does a superb job with making this opera understandable for all ages. It is a wonderful intro of opera for children. I first watched this as a child and now many years later am able to enjoy it again.
2,Amahl and the Night Visitors- DVD of the 1955 telecast,"I love this opera and I want to use it for my English classes here in South Korea. I ordered the DVD of the historic 1955 telecast. Of course, I knew it was B & W. What I didn't know was the sound wasn't clear and many of the lyrics indistinguishable. Sometimes the music was too loud. The limitations of the stage, after viewing so many natural settings on TV of the past 60+ made many things stilted. I suppose that I should have expected these ""problems"". Nevertheless, I suggest that you re-master this production and give it the visual and audio clarity it deserves.Thank you!"
5,Reviving wonderful memories,"I remember seeing Amahl on TV in my teenage years, and it is very hard to find it being produced. So I was delighted to find this original, and at a reasonable price. I got one for myself and one for my granddaughters. Shortly after I ordered it, there was a production on TV (in color, which was nice), but it wasn't as good quality as this original. Thanks for making it available."
5,Remember the Wayback Machine?,"Well! I thought this was a lot of fun. It took me back to the time I saw this very performance - the same grainy black and white. My grandkids thought it was extremely primitive. Grainy black and white did nothing for them, they declared the set to be dorky and they were glad there were subtitles because they couldn't understand a word. We all appreciated the slice of history and those young whippersnappers got a greater appreciation for all us oldtimers went through to bring them the slick presentations of today.Delivery was quick, the DVD in 'mint' condition."
3,A good learning tool,This is a good introductionary piece forthose who are just learning aboutoperas.
4,Menotti's Amahl,"While the video presentation of the opera is truly early TV (Black & White, etc), the production is absolutely fabulous. The acting, the voices, the story is very moving. I feel privileged to have it in my collection."
5,Childhood memory,This was a Christmas memory that I had as a child. We always used to watch it. Still lovely today.
1,Menotti - Amahl and the Night Visitors,"It was one of the worst dvd's that I have seen. The sound was not synchronized with the video, the picture quality was poor. I was very disappointed with the people that transferred it over from VHS. I returned it and was credited. This particular dvd should never have been offered for sale..."
2,The music lives,"I love the music of this old Christmas piece, full of memories. I've listened to it on records and CDs for years, but I wanted the visual effect of the opera, which I have seen onstage, live. This is a film of the original production;,uesbut sadly, the 1955 TV production values are a disappointment. I expected black-and-white, but the total effect is so much inferior to, say, a 1955 motion-picture film. That said, the voices are splendid!"
4,Christmas classic,"I didn't read the description carefully enough and did not realize this was made in 1955. I would have preferred a more modern staging. However, the singing was first rate and I enjoyed it."
5,Marvelous,I had not seen this since I was a child. How wonderful to see it again. I was just as moved as I was when I was a childPray it Forward: Spiritual Growth Meditations
1,in no hurry to buy,"Sometimes being ""original"" isn't necessarily better. Now don't get me wrong... I love this opera and grew up watching it on tv as did many reviewers.. But I'm not wasting my money on a black and white early tv video. What I am hoping for is a DVD of the wonderful video filmed on location in Israel with Theresa Stratas as the mother. I saw this the first time on PBS circa 1979, and was able to find a video tape produced by VAI. However it is time for a release of that performance on DVD. If I want to hear the original cast, I have the cd of that performance."
4,The Original Is Finally Released,"I cannot confirm whether this is the 1954 version or later (it lists it as 1955 telecast). The original (1951)had Chet Allen as Amahl. This version has Bill McIver. I watched the Hallmark Hall of Fame each year as they showed this wonderful performance. I have been looking for a release of this version for years. This is close enough to the ""original"" to be collected. The sound and video quality are very good, especially considering what the telecast was like. I have no complaints. The story should be well known from the summary, later versions and the reviews. 50 years have not diminished the greatness and enjoyment of this classic."
3,Menotti - Amahl and the Night Visitors,"I have been looking for this title on DVD for many years. This was a favorite of mine from my early youth. This is not to say that I am a fan of Opera or that I believe that Jesus was born on December 25th. As I expected, this appears to be a simple, VHS to DVD transfer. The original video recording was apparently captured and canned as-is, that is to say, no studio overdubbing. Therefore, the lyrics are often hard to understand. Just the same, I am overjoyed to own this rare seasonal production. If you liked this title as a child, nothing is different (except maybe your own hearing). You should still like it today."
5,An old classic,"This film was asked for by our residents (Assisted Living and Nursing Home). It was a favorite past classic, that was shown on TV, but no longer seems to make the Christmas Movies. The discussion group that followed, was wonderful. It really triggered many memories for our viewers."
4,Liked very much.,This is my second version of this opera. I like both versions. Amahl was very good in this version. ok
2,Good show. Bad release.,"Air is a pretty decent show, though not quite as good as Kanon and Clannad that came afterwards. ADV also gave it a great dub. But it's not worth buying this set. Not only does it cram all the episodes onto two discs, with Funi's usually bad AV quality as a result, but it also strips one of the episodes from the series. It may only be a recap episode, but it's still part of the show.This is not a complete collection, and not worth buying."
3,a very sad story!,"I bought this anime cuz I got it for a really good price on here. I watched the whole thing at first there where some really funny episodes ,but then it just kept getting sad and more sadder by the end of the series I broke down and started crying! I don't think I will ever watch this anime ever again and I'm thinking about sending it back and getting my money back!"
3,Not One of The Better Animes I've Seen,"I found it a little hard to get into. The characters were developed alright and the story moved at a good pace, but I just didn't feel much sympathy for any of them. Certain elements of the show didn't transfer to well from storyboard to the screen. Still, it did offer enough emotion and character to warrant 3 stars. The animation style for the girls (very big eyes) didn't appeal to me, but the story overall was decent. If possible, maybe watch a few episodes from a rental or on the internet before buying to make sure this is for you."
2,Disapointing,"I don't know what it is about this book.... I had heard about it from a friend and looked it up here on amazon, it had enough good reviews for me and I decided to get it. I was very disapointed, the story line was good and the characters could ahve been interesting and fun, but there is just something about this book that made it VERY dificult for me to get through and even harder to really like. I felt no connection to the characters, and the romance between Jessex and Kirith Kirin was just.... it didnt seem real to me. I truely don't know what to say about this book. It wasnt my favorite but I cant say it is the worst book I have ever read."
4,Great Book!,"I had read ""Winter Birds"" and ""Dream Boy"" by Jim Grimsley, so I knew he was a great author. Sci-fi and fantasy are my favorite genres though, so I was really excited to read this book. It's really a great story and Grimsely does a wonderful job in creating his fantasy world. It has great character developement, and the characters also show true emotion. There are so few fantasy books that are geared toward the gay and lesbian community, or even have gay characters, so it's great when we get one that's actually good! Thanks Jim!"
4,Could be better,"The first 70% is a great read, but after the turning point of the story line: the war of the wizards, both the plot and the characters get thinner and flatter, as if the author tried to finished it in a hurry..."
2,Not a book for me,"I look at the ratings and see 4 and 5 stars so I read the book.In the beginning of the book Jessex was an interesting character. He learns magic, and discovers he is really talented but then he falls in love with Kirith Kirin and oh by the way who is a man! I stopped reading this book right after their love scene at 1/4 of the book. This is not a book for me or anybody else who has similar disinterests."
5,Enchanting,"A spell binding book. One can not stop reading. Sometimes you start believing, that magic could be real. I felt with Jessex and Kirith Kirin throughout the hole book. One hopes for them to win the great war and above all to be together one day happy and untroubeld. I wish Arthen would be real and I could go there one day to become young again. I'm waiting for a sequel."
4,Mercedes Lackey fans will enjoy Kirith Kirin,"Fans of author Mercedes Lackey's novels about the Heralds of Valdemar are sure to enjoy Jim Grimsley's ""Kirith Kirin"". After reading Grimsley's haunting and beautiful novel ""Dream Boy,"" I was intrigued to see how the writer would handle a fantasy genre piece. Grimsley really delivers...a tome filled with enchanting visions of a world where magic is revered, but little understood except by those who are very adept in the art. Don't let the hundreds of pages of very fine print scare you...Excellent map, glossary, and other appendices make the world portrayed come to life."
3,A ponderous Tolkien epigon,"Let's face it: contriving an entire fantasy world like Tolkien and Leiber and Storm Constantine did whit Middle Earth,Nehwon and the Wraeththtu world isn't easy. Jim Grimsley results indoing so are uneven. Great athmosphere, some beautiful evocative scenes (like Jessex in the abandoned city), but on too many places the reader feels like he's swimming in molasses.The general background isn't very clear,and one has to go to the appendix to see which is which.And the premise itself of the story isn't much plausible,on my opinion,even for a fantasy world. But what really annoyed me were the absurdly unsightly uneuphonious names the author chose for places and things: Shenesoeniis, Chalianthrothe, Gnemorra, Curaeth Curaesyn, to name some. Their quoyness (see Douglas Adams' Meaning of Liff) is another, if marginal, flaw of the book. O Elbereth Gilthoniel!"
3,Nice fantasy but plodding,"Kirith KrirnJim GrimsleyThis is a fantasy story concerning a young boy who will become the next Wizard of the northern kingdoms. The Prince to be King will fall in love with him and they will have adventures. The plot moves slowly with attention to many details that are not obviously connected to the story line. Unlike Robert Jordan, however, Grimsley does not overdo the language and culture. Much there is here to link to history and culture. Also there aren't monsters and a brace of enemies. There is one Drugaen Keefax with whom Jessex struggles. One apparent thing missing with Drugaen is why he turned to shadow. Also why did Queen Arthryn allow him to bring shadow into the southern kingdom?"
2,Jessex is a bore... both as a character and a narrator...,"You'd think a 15 year old faced with being the salvation of an immortal king, the keystone of an army of thousands and integral the future of the entire world would be overwhelmed, frightened, excited, disbelieving, in awe-- but Jessex, the protaganist of this novel is about as wooden as he is perfect. And Oh, is he ever perfect. Jessex has none of the frailty or humanity we've come to expect from even the cheapest dime-store fantasy novels. As a result, the book is a near complete loss... I truly pity Kirith Kirin, facing the prospect of several lifetimes with someone so completely uninteresting."
3,Good,I enjoy the story line of both movies and the scenery is very pretty. The music is enjoyable and the costumes were very neat and classical.
3,Quality that only VHS can provide...except that it's a DVD.,"""Connecticut Yankee"" is one of my favorite films: it's a pity that the transfer is of such poor quality.I also find it curious that it has to be bundled with another film. Is ""Connecticut Yankee"" not enough by itself? I honestly have no interest in the other film.Plus, although the film is a must have, it's a bit pricey at $12.99."
2,bing crosby,"This dvd is hard to find. Unfortunately it is a poor quality. The picture is fuzzy. However, if you enjoyed the movie, then you will enjoy this until a better one comes along"
4,My son-in-law's favorite,"My son-in-law could not believe we had not seen this movie so we bought it for a vacation time together. It was interesting, not exactly what we expected but it was fun."
4,A Connecticut Yankee is a wonderful all time classic!,I love this movie and was so glad when it finally came out on DVD. The Emperor Waltz was just an added bonus because I only got it for the first movie.
4,One of my favorites when I was a kid!!,"Well as my title says, ""Emporer Waltz"" was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid...mainly because there was a poodle in it! I was crazy about dogs when I was a kid and dogs play a pretty large part in this movie! I'll admit plot/script wise it is a little weak, but it was still pretty good! And I really don't even like Bing Crosby! I listened to the other one while doing some other things and it was pretty funny too! I think I had seen it before...but I could be remebering ""The Court Jester"" which it is somewhat similiar too..either way if you want to watch some funny movies from the 40's or 50's that you haven't seen a million times before I would reccomend these!P.S. It was a little confusing though about the way they set up the DVD...I think the movies are on different sides of the disc, but they had options for both on the main menus...oh well, it needs further investigating."
2,Great idea of a movie but lacks class,"This review is for ""Connecticut Yankee"" only. This movie is very enjoyable even as a musical! But there's one big problem - it's a moral one. Bing Crosby goes for a beautiful lady who is betrothed to someone else. Why couldn't this beautiful lady not be ""taken"" in the storyline? This movie reminds me of ""Titanic"" by James Cameron, where Kate Winslet is to marry someone else but goes for Leonardo DiCaprio without breaking off the other engagement first, which would have been the right thing to do. A lot of people think there's nothing wrong with this behavior. I would love to keep this movie for my collection...but it lacks class."
4,Two classic Bing movies,"I bought this movie because I wanted to see A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. I hadn't seen it since I was a boy and I remembered really enjoying it. But I had never seen The Emperor Waltz. Both movies are classic Bing movies, where he is the Sauvé ladies man who sings his way into girls' hearts, but I actually found myself enjoying The Emperor Waltz better than Yankee. It wasn't nearly as silly as Yankee and it was quite romantic. If you like Bing movies I'd definitely give these a try."
2,Heller With a Gun,"to tell you the truth, i didn't like this book. i am not into the whole ""western"" books. i had to read it for a project at my school and i thought it was terrible. plain and simple. sorry to all you out there who liked it but u guys r weird!"
3,Not what I was looking for,"I was hoping for more of a shabby chic design, but it was fun to browse thru and get some ideas."
4,3 and a half stars,"This book is not bad, it has useful information, it has nice photos (some I've found a little dated).However it is still helpful if you want to create your own little cottage retreat and you can get some inspiration looking at the pictures too.I was still a little disappointed when I've received this book, probably I was expecting more up-to-date photos. I've seen better picture books out there on cottage style. I think this book is still growing on me...I got some use out of it though."
2,"Pathetic attempts at humor, overall bad writing.","I generally enjoy watching old movies, but this is not one of the good ones. While Hitchcock managed a few decent movies, I think he was LARGELY overrated.The story is thin, attempted humor is more annoying than funny (as is Peter Lorre), in general the writing is bad and the acting not so great. Our war spies end up getting credit for a job they couldn't/didn't even do - they were pathetic and so was the whole setup which makes the USA look foolish and incompetent. In fact, the more I think about this movie after watching it, the more I dislike it.I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. Sorry."
2,Best Keep As A Secret,"This is a story with a modicum of drama except for a small dog (surprising given the starry nature of the human cast), close to nonexistence suspense, and muddy sound recording compounded with hard to understand dialog (English accents and all that). Gielgud's performance as the hero is mostly one dimensional (when you can understand his delivery); as the heroine, Carroll's ""acting"" ranges from chatty to zombie; and Lorrie's delivery is over-the-top ham (and, quite frankly, an embarrassment) as he portrays the ""good-guy"" killer. All this is in marked contrast to the achievements of the fourth principal performer, Robert Young. Young provides an acting tour de force as the subject matter of the film. He makes the film his own!There are some gee-wiz (for the time, 1936) special in-camera/editing effects which were then fast becoming (and would continue to be) a Hitchcock trademark.Not one of Hitchcock's masterpieces, but not one of his disasters either.WILLIAM FLANIGAN, Ph.D"
3,Worth A Look,"Here is a Hitch movie that-although it is great, is very hard to watch. I think perhaps it is because of the plot which explores peoples fasination with killing a person. To begin with Carrol's character is all but too ready to kill the man. She thinks it would make a high old time. Gielgud's character knows, though that even if he does have orders and he's doing it for his country- that murder isn't a pretty thing to live with.The movie starts out that you think he's dead but you soon find out that the government faked his death because they had an under cover job for him. He and Carrol (As well as Lorre) were to track down a spy and do away with him.It really is a great movie, but if you aren't in the mood to think save it for when you are. But definatly check it out!!!!"
3,"Interesting, ""But"".","Interesting story, Hitchcock touch is evented. Madeleine Carroll is a standout, but did not buy into John Gielgud as the lead."
3,One of Hitchcoks earlier thrillers,"During WW1, Edgar Brodie has to assume a false identitiy and go on a secret mission to Switzerland. I liked the film because of the way Hitchcock builds the suspense in a viewer up to the climax of the incident at the Langen Alp. The carachter of Brodie, who has to go on a misson although he doesn't care much for espionage, and is really cold in some situations, is very interesting, along with the General and Elsa. Although his later work is much better in the ways of charachters and effects this is a good film, and I would recomend it not just to Hitchcock fans, but anyone who enjoys a good film."
1,THE TRANSFER QUALITY WAS THE SECRET,"WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! The transfer quality of this DVD ""SECRET AGENT"" is discusting. This is the 21st century, the digital age. With the latest transfer machines on the market there are no excuses for studio's churning out rotten transfers. Before you buy this disc, ask yourself if you can sit through an unwatchable image. Good old ""Hitch"" would turn in his grave if he knew what was happening to his precious movies. A warning should be posted about the rotten transfer of this disc and I have just done it! DON'T BUY IT. DEMAND BETTER QUALITY!"
2,Secret Agent,"Only for fans of Hitch. Very dated for today's audience. Slow pace and confusing character development, especially Peter Lorre's ""General"". Stiff portrayals and a surprising lack of suspense. Where's a Macguffin when you need one?"
3,A so-so movie from Hitchcock,"I have to say, I didn't really enjoy this movie. I would recommend renting it before considering purchasing it.I found there to be very little chemistry between Gielgud and Carrol, and Peter Lorre seems determined to steal every scene he is in. The story was a bit thin as well."
5,"Review on ""Secret Agent""","For those late Saturday nights, when all you want to do is watch a good classic thriller with the family, there is really nothing to compare with a good Alfred Hitchcock movie. In secret agent, a young soldier is summoned by his superiors, and finds out that he has been listed in the newspapers as having been killed in action. John Gielgud is excellent in this role, and is complimented by the lovely Madeleine Carroll, a thrill seeking agent who stars as his ""wife"". Robert Young, more known for his roles in musicals and a few crime dramas, plays the part of an American, and the ""third man"" in this movie, invoking more than a passing interest in Carroll. The plot twists and turns are well worked out, and the whole movie is worth watching. Peter Lorre is especially at his best, as a bloodthirsty Spanish agent working with Gielgud and Carroll. If you are a fan of Hitchcock films, then I would recommend that you add this movie to your collection."
1,Inexpensive junk.,"I want to be sure to let all of the Amazon members know that this DVD would not play in my DVD player. I purchased three Hitchcock films from this distributor and only one of the three DVDs actually played. This one didn't, so buyer beware!"
5,Top value stereolab,"Three of the best stereolab albums, on the cheap - can't go wrong. Buy it now, and then listen to the first track on 'Mars Audiac Quintet' - 'Three-Dee Melodie'. This is pop at its very finest."
1,Not what I Thought,"I bought this book thinking this was Historical fiction...I was wrong, this is trash, one of the most ridiculous books I've ever read, he doesn't know squat, and his characters are ludicrous, badly written and boring."
1,A terrible mistake in the history of the music industry,"Sheena Easton is a terrible mistake in the history of the music industry. How did this woman ever get signed? Don't buy this CD, it's gross. 80s pop is a bad genre of music. This whole CD is a bad example of that bad genre.First of all, it's 15 songs. 15 songs is cool if the singer is good. But Sheena is BAD. This CD is 15 songs of torture and regret -- regret of ever putting the CD in your CD player. Her voice is weak. The songs are very upbeat and poppy, but with her voice, they sound weird. She's not good at pop. And she's even worse at ballads. She's just bad at everything. She's a total Madonna wannabe.Please, please, PLEASE don't purchase this CD. It's a waste of your money. Buy something good! NOT Sheena Easton!"
3,Copper Spirals,"Overall good product. What you see is what you get. They are pretty small though, smaller than I thought they would be."
3,A pleasant read over all....,"I thought this book was enjoyable to read. Say, a decent book to read in the park on a nice afternoon. Nothing too intense. It was a little slow in the middle, but still had enough interesting stories to keep the reader going and find out what happened to this young woman. It picked up the pace toward the end, almost putting off too much for the end; the intense reunion with her father, graduating Harvard, and plenty of wrestling team metaphors for her growing self-realizations -- all within the last few chapters. Compared to other books I've read, it wouldn't be a 5-star because it wasn't particularly life-altering, funny, witty or original. A well-rounded 1st novel for Summer though."
1,Bad (old?) pills that gave me hives,"I have been taking astragalus supplements for a very long time. I dicided to give Gaia's liquid gel pill a try, hoping for better absorption. However, only after a couple of days of taking it, I developed a lot of hives all over my body. When I examed the pills, I saw that every pill was only half filled with liquid. This can be indications that the pills were very old that the liquid had been dried up and poor packaging. I stoped taking it and threw out the opened bottle. I kept the unopened one so I can send to a lab for testing later. Will NEVER buy any Gaia product again!"
3,"Good, but there are better hard house albums by Frankie.","I was slightly disappointed after giving this album a listen or two. It doesn't seem to be either dance or listening music. It's very inbetweenish. For a more cohesive experience check out Live in California, or Escape From Brooklyn. Also, SEE HIM LIVE! I saw him at Confetti's in Poughkeepsie May 14. He's amazing, and his live set was a trip w/ or w/ out drugs. He knows how to roll w/ a crowd and get'em dancin'."
2,"""wheres the beats""?","i was really dissapointed when i bought this album. The first time i heard bones was live when i was 15 at the ""Wave"" in Staten island the kid sent me into a trance. He is the master of beats and welcomed me to the scene.I havent stopped dancing yet.To expierance bones dont purchase this album see him live at his best or check out technolo-g or houseloop.Frankie bones is known for the boom boom and he will without a doublt ,keep you thumpin!!!"
4,:-),"Terrific movie about an experiment that works in more ways than one. A gorgeous girl who always has things going her way loses an athletic scholarship to college when she gets injures-and that was the only way she could pay. To earn the money, she enters a contest where she disguises herself as a fat girl and goes undercover at another school. She soon learns how cruel people can be to severely obese people-especially in high school. Fans of The Big Bang Theory will love seeing Kaley Cuoco (Penny) in this. Limited amount of DVD extras."
4,Don't dare to be different.,"Although this film is a tough watch, it's pretty honest about how some people are treated very differently when presented in a less than perfect package. We all are unique and one of a kind, but sometimes our differences become stumbling blocks when we meet less than tolerant people. Some of the best people in the world are oftentimes overlooked, shunned, or mistreated because of how they look. Nobody makes the rules so to speak, but peers usually dictate what is accepted or popular at any given time. Many times I have wondered how different the world would be if we were viewed from the inside out. Our differences make us unique, not less than what we should be.While this film is not too easy to watch at times, it should be viewed by students in this day and time of bullying and separation. Certainly a good study on what might be if we take the time to see that differences can influence our relationships in a great way if we let them."
2,Not the color I wanted...,"Disappointed....It was not what it looked like in the photo, the product quality is satisfactory. I prefer other combos by this brand."
4,Nice addition to my collection,"Quick shipping, good price, nice colors, wish the brown/plum was more plum than brown but otherwise nice! Much better than paying full price or higher price in stores, will order from here again"
4,Love Tobias Wolff!,"A very short read, but full of emotion and great story. David Sedaris also highly recommends this read. Try it. you'll like it!"
2,a good book to read,The book was interesting to me because the author speaks about life in the Army. Some soldiers got good and bad experience during their time. The book makes comments about three diferent soldiers.
3,"More Golf, Less pedantic detail please","I'm not a huge fan of this book. I made my way thought it, but it was a bit of a slog. The book is more about the behind the scenes aspects of the Open than the actual Open itself or the professional golfers plying their skills and the competition itself. As such, you'd really have to have an interest in the minutia of event planning to enjoy this read."
2,Below Par,"I like Feinstein's work but this book is a bore. The first 100 pages are mini-biographies of USGA staff. Someone out there must find interesting which college basketball team is the favorite of the USGA publicity director, but I am at loss to understand whom."
5,outstanding way to learn about he USGA,"I highly recommend this book. It is a great, behind-the-scenes look at how much work and planning goes into each Open Championship. It's exceptionally well-written, and easy to understand and follow. And reading it on my Kindle made the experience that much more enjoyable."
5,Truly Inside the Ropes,"In his book ""Open...Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black"" John Feinstein truly takes you inside the ropes at one of the most talked about golf championships in history. Beyond Golf, the 2002 US Open at Bethpage Black was unusual for so many reasons. From the inner workings at the USGA, The New York State Parks Department, NBC Sports, to the Long Island Railroad, you get a real sense this was more than a typical 72 holes of Golf. Be prepared to miss a few rounds as this is a difficult book to put down."
4,Beautiful puzzle...,"My 15 year old daughter, and myself worked this together. It is a gorgeous puzzle. Pretty difficult with all the blues, fabrics and small pieces. It was a lot of fun to do as a Christmas activity! I have given it four stars for the oddly shaped pieces, which did make it more difficult. It would also be nice if the pieces were a bit heavier."
5,OTHER USES,"This product is coconut waste, and is excellent for potting orchids. Mix with charcoal and your orchids thrive. Coconut is notoriously slow to decompose, and has anti-fungal properties. Easy to work with and the orchids require a lot less water. Drains well."
5,Fabulous/Fantastic,We had the opportunity to listen to ulu's new CD. It is fantastic! We want to own one to keep in the car and one for the house. And we'll be buying this CD to give to friends. Please let us know as soon it is available to order.
2,Not that great...,"I found this album very monotonous and disappointing. I am an avid fan of Jazz-Funk Jambands, but this album, no matter how many times I hear it, just isn't that good. Most of the songs drone on one groove, go into space and lack inspired playing. The one high point of the record is SMB, which is really cool, I'll admit. If you're looking to expand your collection beyond Galactic and The Greyboy Allstars, I'd recommend checking out OO Soul, Sugarman 3, Mofro, Corduroy or some John Scofield first."
5,THE DEADLIEST PLANE CRASH,"VERY GOOD DVD,NOVA DID AN EXLANT JOB RECREATING THE TWO 747'S CRASHING INTO EACH OTHER."
1,rip off the the century.,"a 10 cent plastic item for $200gotta line up for that, gee.ordecimal points have be banned.hahaheheheheh"
1,Not what you think it is. It's terrible.,"If you've recently been to Hawaii and you are looking for the music by 10 feet, this is NOT the band. This one is horrible and it only has three terrible songs on it. Not recommended."
4,The beauty of cats,"The author provides an introduction on the history of the domestic cat, and then proceeds to discuss the different breeds in the chapters: Persian or Longhaired; Other Longhaired; Unusual & Semi-longhaired; Shorthaired; Foreign Breeds; Oriental and Siamese; and Pet Cats. All the major pedigree breeds are identified and described with a short history of the breed, to help the prospective owner to decide which variety to choose, as well as the most important points to look out for. The magnificent color photographs capture the full spectrum of the beauty of cats, from the cuteness of the playful kitten to the splendor of champion show winners. It is a delightful read and a valuable reference source to the different breeds of cats. Highly recommended to all people owned by cats."
3,Wrong answers,"Since this is a first edition, a lot of answers in the solutions manual are wrong. If a student is on the brink of understanding a topic and the book gives him/her the wrong answer, it doesn't build too much confidence."
1,Gives me a headache,"I am now taking calculus with this book. I don't know how people survived calculus with this book. This book is for someone who really has a grasp on calculus, not for beginners. The examples don't match the problems, so you're thoroughly confused and have nothing to look at to help you when you're doing homework. You get a headache literally just from trying to understand it. Calculus is hard enough and the authors make it harder to learn than it needs to be. I've had other calculus books that explain much better and have very thorough examples that I could understand and keep up with. This book does a very poor job."
5,Perfect Condition!,"Book was exactly as I wanted and significantly cheaper then at my school book store (65% cheaper). It looks BRAND NEW, the user said it was ""like new"", and it came very very fast. I took AP Calculus my Jr. year of high school, and I will be repeating the course as a freshman at my university. I qualified to take the 300 level math which is Calc II, but decided on Math 226, which is Calculus I at my university. The material looks challenging, and for me since I only took AP Stats my senior year, I've forgotten a bit of Calculus. I had a very very good Calculus teacher and feel very confident that I will do very well in this class since I earned a very hard A as the youngest student (16 yrs old) taking the course at my high school."
3,"This guy goes crazy on functions, but overall a good book!","Like I said, he went crazy on functions and in some instances did not explain well enough the material, but he summed up the meaning and simple basis of the study of calculus and I enjoyed learning his slick tricks."
3,as a future calculus teacher...,"I used this book for my calc class and while it is an interesting and noble approach at changing the way calculus is being taught today, it lacks the ability to explain things on the student's level. It is a great text if someone already knows calculus, to get at the concepts in an alternative light. However, for students with little or no calculus experience - prepare to be lost and pray for a hepful professor."
1,Not worth the effort,"This is the third calculus book I've had, and the only one I haven't understood. In the others I could always follow their examples and relate them to the homework questions. In this book the example problems have nothing to do with the homework questions. I imagine if one had a good calculus teacher this would be less of a problem.Basically this book taught me nothing more than to hate calculus."
4,Good enough to buy,"After checking it out of the library, I found ""Goodbye, Columbus"" good enough to purchase for my personal collection. What a riot this book is in parts. I had a class in college where we read parts of it to ""show what a chauvinist Roth is,"" but I really didn't get that impression when I read the *entire* novel.And the scene where Ron is listening to his graduation album just cracked me up.Don't remember enough about the short stories to comment with any authority, so I'll leave those alone."
4,A great book about young lust.,Goodbye Columbus is a book centering around a young lustful relationship in which problems arise due to differences in social class and religion. It is an easy read and is a good choice for someone who wants to read something entertaining. It is best for mature readers who do not mind a sexual theme.
3,"Good, just good","This book is certainly good, it's a story of a poor guy that has an affair with this rich girl, and they have a great time together but at the end they break out. Their relation is very weird and they are not the typical ridiculous couple, maybe because they are old enough for that stuff. Neil lives with his Aunt Gladys and uncle Max in Newark, while Brenda lives in Short Hills, a rich neighborhood. He falls in love with Brenda, and they have a summer sex-party with sessions every day at Brenda's home. Finally they're discovered by Brenda's parents and then all is over for them. They were discovered because Brenda ""forgot"" her diaphragm in his room and her mother found it. However Neil finds out that Brenda just made things happen, so she could break out with him."
1,"Good book, kindle edition filled with typos","I guess somebody scanned a paper version of this book to build the kindle edition, as it appears to be filled with OCR errors.The content of the writing is enjoyable, but the kindle-edition typos are a real buzzkill for getting into the book.Get it in paperback, skip the kindle edition."
3,"Goodbye Brenda, Goodbye",It is an excelent story for everyone even young readers. It is one of those stories that applies to everyone and everywhere. A must read for all. Highly recomended. The end was a bit predictable but still a good book.
3,Goodbye characterization,"Goodbye Columbus is not a really good book, it does not matter if this is an award winning story, the lack of characterization and the main character makes this book a failed attempt of feeling sympathetic about him. This is the story of a summer love, the protagonist, Neil Klugman is a kid who mets Brenda Patimkin, a girl of upper class that falls in love with him, but Neil is always making fun of her and her social class, sometimes being even mean to her. For this reason, the reader can never like him. The setting of the novel is great, but flaw is the protagonist and his attitude and that is not good, because when you begin to read the novel, the expectations are high, but in the end it dissapoints."
2,I wouldn't recommend this book....too much dam sex!,"I wouldn't recommend this book...I believe that Roth is too involved in the characters having sex than trying to get some sort of plot going....I didn't enjoy reading Goodbye, Columbus, but I did enjoy reading the short stories where it is not about sex but rather about religion. thank you for the short stories...."
1,Unexpected,"I had to read this book for a college class, and it was not what I expected. I liked ""Defender of the Jews"" but not the main novella, ""Goodbye Columbus."""
1,No Thanks!,"The movie infatuated sub-literate ""reviews"" of this adaptation immediately turned me off, they can probably only ingest it in audio format. The Amazon no-name who misspelled HARLAN ELLISON's name didnt help, he's a vastly better writer than roth, and the only reason I was going to buy these tapes, guess not."
1,Numerous transcription errors in Kindle edition,"While Ross is an excellent writer and I hate to leave a review that nit-picks the format rather than the content, I think it's useful for those considering buying the Kindle edition to be warned that the digital text has numerous obvious copy errors, seemingly created when scanning the book: ""candles"" become ""candies"", ""corn"" becomes ""com"", etc., over and over throughout the book. It's usually easy to work out what the word should have been, but it's very distracting and breaks the flow of the text."
4,Typos,No doubt that Philip Roth is one of our most talented and courageous writers. Too bad this Kindle Edition is so riddled with typos that they distract from the power of the prose.
2,Kindle edition chock full of OCR errors,"Sadly, the kindle edition is replete with typos - seemingly from an un-proofread OCR translation. A truly great book, but completely unreadable. Too bad Roth's publisher isn't available on the itunes store..."
3,Memories..oh sweet memories...,"It was the early 80s and I was in the library in Woodbridge Middle School. I found a hardcover book that seemed interesting. A time travel story. Being into science fiction I, of course, checked it out. I enjoyed it so much that I remembered it till this day. In fact, I had to order it when I found it on Amazon. Of course I had forgotten the title, the author, almost everything but was lucky to find a site on prehistoric fiction. But lets move onto the plot.Yes, the plot is simple - in those days sending teens back in time was the norm. Teenagers in sci-fi fought aliens, destroyed monsters and saved the world all the time. Sometimes more than once.Sadly, the science, mostly with early life, is outdated. Well, duh, it was first printed in 1966. Of course the dinosaurs and their behavior is all wrong. But I think it would still make a good gift for a child just starting to read or explore books. Or for a person who wants, like me, to relive moments of childhood."
2,The last 40 years haven't been kind to this book,"Science that is so far off I have a hard time believing that it was thought to be accurate in 1966. Dinosaurs whose only behavior is maniacal attack, even in the case of some herbovores. Prehistoric men who operate pretty much on the same level - savages just gotta be savage, after all. A paleontologist who travels back to the time of the dinosaur and collects no data - mostly just shoots things. Only one female character, who is mostly only happy when she does something to please the male heros. People who make bizarre choices apparantly only because the plot needs them to. No character development, clumsy writing, sloppy editting.Actually, Lester Del Rey didn't even write this. Someone else wrote it to his outline.There was good science fiction written in 1966, but is probably a example of why science fiction used to have such a crummy reputation."
3,"Okay, but not my type of movie.","This movie is average stuff IMHO. The movie has SpongeBob and Patrick traveling to the forbidden Shell City, a place where no sea animal has ever returned from,to retrieve King Neptune's Crown that Plankton has stolen for his evil plan Z. There are a couple of funny moments like when SpongeBob Gets Drunk from eating too many Goofy Goober Sundaes, and the fish at the County Line, But I didn't think that those things or really anything in the movie was too funny(no offence). Also, SpongeBob drives a hamburger to their destination, which is pretty cool, but come on, A sponge driving a hamburger? Puh! Also, there was no humor in the movie, which made double the dissapointment for me."
5,Love it,"My seven year old loves this movie. Now he can watch it whenever he likes, so we are all happy."
3,I Can't Wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The only reason I'm rating it 3 stars is cause the movie isn't coming out till nov. 19th!! I really wanna see it! I love the previews! ""BIGGER, SQUARIER, SPONGIER!"" It's so random how they came up with it, but it sounds sooooooooooooooooooo convincing! Please be as good as u sound!"
1,"Once again, the G rating only good enough for OUTSIDE USA!!!","As with every Nick movie from 2002 onwards, this movie is rated PG. However, some countries, like the U.K. for example, has a G equivalent. Come on! We hardly get to see G rated movie in theaters anymore! There are lots of PG movies for families that are innocent and don't deserve a high rating. Maybe it's just a filthy trick for the MPAA to encourage children to read a book or play a sport? B***S**T! I like movies, and kids like movies. I don't it when parents worry. Please, MPAA? Let our country's children see a stinkin' movie, will ya?"
1,"Really bad, boring, stupid movie.","I had to watch this in my band class when we had a substitute teacher because some teenagers are so immature they watch SpongeBob. I don't watch TV at all, and was not expecting to see this movie.The ""humor"" in this movie ranges from forced (the whole ""Goofy Goober"" thing, a Chuck E. Cheese-like establishment, only with peanutes) to disturbing (SpongeBob's mentally challenged friend Patrick Star flies into a ceremony naked with a flag in his butt). The only good part is when SpongeBob and Patrick get drunk off ice cream. You know what would've been the perfect ending? Them getting arrested for underage drinking.Hey, I'd laugh."
1,100% CR**!,"What the f**k is this? The TV show was funnier than this garbage! People who doesn't have seen this movie, DON'T SEE IT! It's a yasste of time and money!"
1,tottaly inapporopraite,(...)! Where was Sandy and Gary?! I watch this ocassionly and hate it! Sponge and Patrick go on an adventure to save the world! Already done! Two best friends on a journey to save the world! Best Part was when...wait no best part!Worst Part: When Spongebob was on David hasslehoffs leg!I reccomend Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events coming to DVD April 26!
1,WHERE IS GARY? I WANT GARY!!!,"WHERE IS GARY? I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! Gary the Snail is the best character in the cartoon. He meows, grooooowls, meows-&-growls at the same time, and can say ''No''. He plays the violin, wears a two-tone pair of Italian brogues, and reads the paper. He is a towering intellect and is granted ZEROOO role in this so-called movie! This omission has angered Gary fanatics all over the world! Any SBSP movie without Gary is sacrilege! WHERE IS GARY? I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! WHERE IS GARY? I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! WHERE IS GARY? I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!!"
4,"Suprisingly, a very good movie","i expected this movie to be terrible, but might as well see it. I was proved wrong. My favorite part has to be the scene at goofy goober's.FINAL THOUGHT - buy, see, rent, steal,or borrow this movie"
4,for fans only.....,"this is a decent movie. I mean, the movie is ok, but if you haven't seen the show, you wouldn't know what is going on. I have watched the show avidly over the past 5 years it has been on tv and it is a damn good show because it has a offbeat sense of humor like predesscors before it, Ren and Stimpy and Rocko's Modern Life. It all starts off when Plankton steals the crown of King Neptune, He freezes Mr.Krabs because He thinks he did it but Spongebob says he didn't and sets off on a mission with the dimwitted star Patrick. They meet Neptune's daughter along the way and she helps them have the courage to be men instead of boys. I thought the movie was pretty funny but had some empty spaces where I was just chuckling and there were some not funny parts at all. I liked it, but with my friends, it was a other story. They thought it was weird. The general audience was Teenagers and kids with parents. This movie was good but not as good as it was advertised."
5,The others don't know what they're saying,"First of all, to you all who said this movie stunk, YOU'RE ALL IDIOTS! This movie is great. People said this is a horrible family movie, wrong! To the person who said if you think the movie is just as good as the tv show, then you haven't seen the show, I know every episode by heart! The movie is a perfect comedy for all ages. Featuring two of the most funny characters in Nickelodeon, this movie is full of humour and surprises. It's definately worth buying. P.S. (SpongeBob isn't gay, he acts like a little kid because that is what the target audience is. Duh.)"
5,Such a Funny Movie!,"The Spongebob Movie is such a hilarious movie! Loads of laughs will leave you wondering why there wasn't such a funny movie released before! This is a story about Spongebob and Patrick's quest to find King Neptune's crown, who is left bald if in lack of this crown. THis is all part of Plankton's Plan Z, which was started to actually work. Even though it is very slap-stik, this movie will not leave you disappointed!"
5,Funniest Movie Of 2004!,"I absolutly LOVED this movie! The jokes were hilarious! The quotes were SO funny! I especaly LOVED it when Patrick said, ""Did you see my underwear?"" Mindy said, ""No, Patrick."" ""Did you want to?"" I HIGHLY reccomend seeing this movie! Defedently see it if you are a HUGE SpongeBob fan, like me!"
3,The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (Widescreen Edition),"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (Widescreen Edition)~ Alec Baldwin is a very good series. However, the movie is not great or that funny. Sure it has its moments like when Spongebob gets ""drunk"" on ice cream and Garry falls in love with the mermaid or the ""thug bar"". Still the story feels rushed and not that well developed and some charachters that have a much bigger part in the series basically get no air time at all. The kings daughter is just annoying and I find it to be such a pc move that it looses the edge that the show has which the movie is completely lacking. Still and all the movie gets the three stars that it rightly deserves."
2,good,It was the most exciting movie ever but Mr.Krabs was barly in the movie and sandy or squidward wern't ethier.
1,Special Features Suck !!!!,"I gave this movie a 5 out of 5 cause the movie itself is awesome. Absolutely just amazing...BUTI had to give the special features a 1 out of 5 casue they suck.Thats just the only way to describ them. There NOTHING of intrest really. Just some intreviews with people about the movie, some other crap about underwater life and stuff. ABSOLUTELY NO SPECIAL FEATURES about spongebob, NO SPECIAL FEATURES for Kids. They would HATE these lame excuses for special features..... nothing interesting or fun at all.Boo to everyone who had imput on this DVD for the spcial features, they really droped the bomb on it !!!!"
2,IT IS WHAT IT IS!,"I don't know what i'm doing rating a spong bob movie. let me say it was a complete disappointment, and boring. but then i remember this is exactly what its supposed to be, a kids cartoon. not an anime for late night airing. buy it for the kids, if your an adult fan, then skip buying, and renting. we realy don't need to watch sponge bob ""grow up."""
3,Needed more humor,"This movie was okay, but I thought it could have been a lot better. I was slightly disappointed that this film didn't contain as many laughs as there usually are on the show (which I am an enthusiastic fan of), and that Squidward was hardly even included in the movie. I was also somewhat irritated by the ""Goofy Goober"" song which is featured in more than one part of the movie. On the positive side, however, the plot is entertaining, the characters are likable, and there is the fairly interesting element of the unanimated world mixed with the animated world. For these reasons, I would give the SpongeBob Squarepants movie three stars."
5,WOW! What a great jolt for Spongebob fans!,"I wasn't sure what to think, sitting there in the theater with my 2 boys & my husband. I knew there were alot of children in the theater, I never imagined I would hear so much adult laughter outside my own. I have been a Spongebob fan since he came on and knew I would like at least a couple things...I laughed so hard....What a great movie. I think this is a movie for people of all ages. When you are a little older you seem to really appreciate the hilarity put into Spongebob & Patrick's characters. How can you not just bust up every time you hear Spongebob tell Plankton, ""...Well, good luck with that!"" It is so in his absolutely wonderful character. My husband (50) and myself (31) are the two biggest fans in the house! What a hoot! This movie, well, it ROCKS!"
4,it's ok,I think it was ok. the surprising thing was that SB and Patrick were the main charactors. what I think they should of done was add more charactors. but otherwise everything was ok.
5,My Son Loves SpongeBob,I bought this for my 7 year old son who loves SpongeBob. He watched it every day during the summer. I would highly recommend this DVD for kids and adults who enjoy watching SpongeBob. It was a delightful movie.
5,children's movie review,"I just had to get this for my son.He is a huge Spongebob fan,and I have to admit,so am I! After seeing it just once on Nickelodeon,he wanted to watch it over and over again,and now he can!"
1,Spongebob STINKS!,"WHY, WHY, WHY does it always have to be the shows I hate so much to take the world by storm?! Rocko's Modern Life is a LOT better than Spongebob! I can't believe that they even LIED about Rocko making an appearance in this movie! For all you Spongebob fans: BOYCOTT SPONGEBOB NOW! ROCKO IS BETTER!"
5,Surprisingly Hysterical,"I'm a huge fan of the show so I had to see the movie. This movie is unbelievably hilarious. If you're an adult who wants to go see a funny movie but they're all rated R and the kids are home so you can't go then go with them to this. I know some people who haven't seen it will be like, ""Right. This movie looks like it's for kids."" Well think again. Most of the jokes in this movie are VERY hidden and only teens and adults will catch on (the Goofy Goober Nut Bar scene is one of them). And the kids will laugh at the occasional fart jokes too. And to give you a heads-up about a funny part then read this and if you don't want to read it then stop reading here.When Spongebob sings the ""Goofy Goober Rock"" song watch when he's screaming into the microphone on the Krusty Krab floor when the mind-slaves are walking toward him and look at what he's doing. SO FUNNY"
2,"""the longest and most boring Spongebob episode ever""!!!!","I really like watching the 15-mins Spongebob Squarepants episodes on TV; they're very innocent and happy, but when I watched this movie I almost lost my head because of the awful it was! This is actually ""the longest and most boring Spongebob episode ever"", the critics here in Chile said that and I totally agree with them.The worst thing the producers could do was to include real people and stupid effects that make you laugh in the movie. Like David Hasselhoff, the made fun of himself by acting here!!!! plus, the stupid effect when he starts acting as if he was a boat or something, I had self-shame when I watched that part!!!!!I think that the worst thing you could do is to buy this DVD: you'll watch it once, you'll hate it and you'll waste 18 bucks. Bad purchase."
2,Kind Of A Let Down To A Good Series,"Here it comes! The big movie of the hilarious TV series, it's The Spongbob Squarepants Movie! Spongbob and Patrick are on a mission to save King Neptunne's crown, and they travel a long long way. Despite my two stars, the move has it's moments when you laugh and giggle. But the movie lost the essance of the series: It wasn't that funny.Spongebob was the icon of goody-goodness-fun. But then the movie is a huge letdown and there should be a sequel to imrpove the series.The funny moments are when Patrick falls in love with the mermaid, (I think her name was Cyndi?) and he's like 'Your Pretty!' Same old Patrick, the character that stays consistent.Movie is worth a rent. Some crude humor and weird images."
1,This edition SUCKS!,"Full Screen Edition dvds suck (UNLESS IT WAS filmed that way). Full Screen crops the theatrical picture to 4:3 ratio which is the shape of a standard (non-widescreen) TV screen. There is no letterboxing, but up to a third of the original picture is lost. WIDESCREEN preserves the original theatrical picture ratio of the film which will appear in ""letterboxed"" format on a normal TV screen. If the movie is going to be modified from it's original version then It should not cost as much."
5,I can't believe this!,"Everyone's concerned about it's ""crude humor"". You don't think your kids ever hear that stuff. Turn on the TV right now. Flick through a few channels like Fox, MTV, VH1. You don't think your kids ever stop and watch it. If you don't like this Movie.You could make your kids bored by making him or her watch Beauty and the Beast. Or Barbie's adventure to Happy Land. I could notice tons of sexual references. Just so you know this is one of the best family oriented movie ever. And they come rare now a days. There is no totally clean 1933 Mickey Mouse short anymore.I think instead of their Kids growing up too quick. I think the parents are adapting to changes in the world slower!"
4,"Not a kid,just no account","I'm 14 (Not a memeber of the target audience)and my favourite films include South Park,Team America and Ali G but for some reason Spongebob always seems to make me laugh but anyway this is a funny film even if childish but is good and has a few funny scenes likePatrick with the flag inbetween his a** cheeksWhen they got drunk on Ice CreamGoffy goober rock songand much more and it's funny and Spongebob is (Along with Kenan and Kel and Rugrats until Kimi and Dil joined)the only show on Nickelodeon I can watch and say I like (Fairly Odd Parents is s**t,Yu Gi Oh is s**t,All Grown Up is s**t,Mr Bean Animated is s**t and so r the rest)"
3,Disappointed,"I love watching Sponge Bob with my Grandkids, unfortunatly this movie doesn't come up to the quality of the TV show.The only thing my Grandkids and I agreed on was Patricks' line ""Did you see my underware? Would you like to?"".Save your money and tape the movie off cable before considering buying it."
5,Squarepants CANNOT get any better than this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this movie at best buy,and it is AWESOME!!!!!! There was this really funny part, but I'm not going to spoil the movie. Patrick is so funny! You should really see this movie. You won't be sorry!P.S. I'm a goofy goober! :)"
2,Not worthy,"I'll admit it: I'm a Spongebob junkie. I've seen almost all of the episodes, multiple times. I saw this movie when it came out in theatres with a fellow Spongebob freak. Gosh, we were like 15 and we did not even care.That being said, I did not care for this movie. The writers make great 12-minute episodes, but apparently nothing good comes from trying to make longer plots. It also has some disturbing parts for younger kids, so I don't even let my niece watch it when it comes on TV. She's a big fan of the episodes as well.All in all, stick with the original shows."
5,Bad,"This cartoon is the worse tv show for kids nickelodeon tv shows nowadays is very lacking same with Disney channel they always Have new episode every day Back in those days that way kids don't lose interest , nowadays they always show the same episode and have one new episode once a week"
3,Great For The Young And The Young At Heart,"I'm 23 and have been a Spongebob fan since day one, and I was actually excited when this movie was released. But the film proved to be just a little disappointing. The movie starts off great, but like a lot of movies, begins to loose steam after a while. It really does feel like an episode off of TV that they have stretched to movie length. The sad thing is that there are episodes of Spongebob that are funnier and more entertaining than this movie. How long can a search for a king's crown last before it gets repetitive and a little dull? I would recommend this film to younger fans, the older fans may not find the plot suspenseful enough to actually keep interest. Spongebob is better as a 15-minute an episode show on Nickelodeon."
5,Full length movie for SpongeBob,My son and I thoroughly enjoyed this feature-length movie. Lots and lots of laughs!
3,Crazy Adventure,"This Spongebob movie is just crazy.It sure has lots of imagination, my grand kids love it!I think this one is aimed more towards children butthen again it depends on what you like.Definitely fantasy, you never know what crazy thing is going to happen next!"
2,Not so much...,"I like Spongebob, though not quite as much as my kids. This was an enjoyable, but not exceptional DVD. Around here the measure of a DVD is the encore factor. If they don't play the hell of of it, it isn't all that. (Doesn't explain El Dorado, that gets played far more often than it deserves.) It hasn't been played a second time, even by my 7 year old who watches SB every day. I wouldn't waste the cash on this one, you'll get more enjoyment out of the endless re-runs they play on Nick."
4,Great value for prep material!!,"Questions cover, with excellent difficulty, all areas of exam 70-229. These are the style of questions all Microsoft exams should contain to maintain the credibility of their certifications.This review is a good heads up on how Microsoft is changing their exams to cover hands on work experience versus fact regurgitation. Very handy sample Exam on CD with Questions randomly generated from the Readiness Reveiw.A better publication than the 70-229 Study Kit."
2,Not Really Accurate,"I had thought that this book and the sample Exam on the CD would be a realy close reflection of the exam content. But whan I took the exam, it didn't seem like that was the case. The book and sample exam seemed to focus on Admin. stuff while the exam seemed to emphasize SQL, TSQL and database design a lot more. I also don't think the book prepares you for security-related questions very well. But it might still be worthwhile for someone who feels ready to take the exam and just wants some practice."
1,A waste of time,"This book is an incomplete mess.Throughout the book there are sample questions to ""quiz"" the reader on the material. BEWARE! many of the answers in the book are wrong.For the harder topics this isn't even a guide at all. Only a list of study points.The CD with practice questions repeats many of the questions in the book and had incorrect answers.A good replacement for this book is a brick wall. Stare at it and you will acheive the same results as reading this book."
2,Only 126 questions !!!,"There are 6 domains and 20 objective, in those 6 domains, of Exam, so count how many questions are per domain (6!!!). Some topics have only 3 questions, and on Exam you will get 3 or more questions from that objective.Before every domain there is list of articles (Training Kit + Books Online) to read for that domain, and every time they write how to start Books Online (klik Start menu, Programs, etc.) 3 - 4 line for somebody that goes on 70-229!!!.1/4 (to 1/3) of almost every page is unused (empty).If 2 or more answers are wrong for the same reason, they will repeat explanation, several lines, again and again.Some questions are for total begginers, and for some you need a lot of expirience.During my web exam expirience I noticed that questions are a little bit easier than the most on the Internet.So if you are total begginer and you have extra money, buy it, but for expirienced people I recomend something like www.certportal.com or other web sites."
1,Not much help...,"Having passed the SQL Server 6.5 exam, I didn't even find this much help as a review or prep for SQL 2000... Had to get a better book immediately!"
5,Got the last one at $149,"I've been searching for weeks for a compact amplified speaker system that delivered full audio response at low volume. Then I stumbled across this rebuilt Bose clock radio made in an American factory in Framingham, Mass and I realized this could be it.Apparently the capacitors in this unit go bad after years of use and create static. If you replace the capacitors it continues to provide years of service .This rebuilt unit displays the time and offers a wakeup system with AM/FM radio but I only wanted it to plug my mp3 player into the RCA jacks on the back and listen to my favorite music in high fidelity with plenty of bass. The only thing you need to connect an mp3 player,laptop,or tablet to this unit is a cable with a male stereo jack on one end and an RCA male plug on the other. These are available online or at any electronics store."
3,Very cute but not so practical.,I fell for the cute design but my daughter complains that the head of the wolf gets in the way! Soft and cuddly but not so practical.
5,The Six Sigma Way Book Review,"The Six Sigma Way is an easy reading book and a must have for anyone contemplating the deployment or currently deploying Six Sigma. The book not only gives an A-Z detail on why,who,what and how to rolling out Six Sigma, it is also an excellent reference tool.The author's bring to life the usefullness of Six Sigma through rela-life examples from various industries.The Six Sigma Way practices what it preaches- it's customer focused and friendly."
5,Senior Leadership Team meeting goer,look how great i am.....i am a member of the senior leadership team which means i just go to meetings all day and really dont do any work....i just blowhard at work all day like i am blowing hard reviewing this book
4,The Six Sigma Way,"The book was very easy to follow. I found it especially helpful that the Six Sigma Way gave tips as to which chapters should be read for each level of Six Sigma implementation. Since my company already had it implemented and I was only reading the book for an understanding of what my company was doing, I was able to skip the unneeded portions about implementation. This was a big time saver."
2,Horridly boring.,"More power to you if you can get something worthwile from this book. I bought the book on CD, and it was easily the most forgettable experience I've had in a while. The information is presented from a 30,000 mile view. So ""big picture"" oriented that it's useless to try and consider the action behind the concepts presented.If you're looking for a way to appear to have read something complicated and high level about Six Sigma. you found your source. If you want real, usable information, look elsewhere."
4,Worth your money -- if you don't know anything yet,"This is a great introduction if you're new to the subject: you'll get the concept, why firms go Six Sigma, etc. The book is likely to gain you to the cause. At the same time, it's very superficial on methodologies and hardly tells you anything about similar efforts of effective engineering like Design for Cost, Design of Experiments, Taguchi methods, etc. Well written and entertaining."
2,Common sense branded and packaged as esoteric knowledge.,"I was amazed at how a book full of nothing new could be sold as if it contains some secret knowledge that only the initiated could comprehend (you know, like that Kung Fu martial arts stuff...take the pebble grasshopper).What it comes down to is an organized approach to identifying, measuring, and improving business processes. This is something I imagine has been going on long before anyone called it ""Six Sigma"".So, if you must have this book how about cutting the cost of acquisition to three bucks or so plus shipping and get a used copy to see if this is for you."
1,Incomplete Content,I couldn't read this book because it is incomplete. There is something wrong with the content in the Kindle version.
3,Good overview but little substance,"This audio book was more of a cheerleader for six sigma than a book to gain knowledge. It would be a good source of information if you have never heard of six sigma, but otherwise it is not very useful. The reader also has an annoying voice."
3,Front Panel broken,The case looks great but had to refund due to the front panel/face plastic inserts being completely sheared off. The front was not even attached and was hanging off.
4,Great case,I've built three computers for family using this case and they all love it. A bit wider than the sandard case but about half the height. Glossy black piano finish.... it only appears cramped if you fail to plan... I use modular P/S and tie down all the cords ...getting ready to buy another.
4,Very good option for mATX,"Unfortunately, this case isn't my ideal mATX case (I haven't found one yet), but it's very well made and attractive.Cable management is difficult, but not any more difficult than other mATX SFF cases I've seen.I would really have liked to see a things to make this excellent:1. Black powder coated inside2. A better cable management system3. Slightly repositioned HDD cage4. Larger case fans"
3,"Sturdy, well made but huge and heavy","Nice box, well made and sturdy but also huge and heavy. I thought when the product was called a LANbox that it would be compact and light but it is just as huge and heavy as my other full tower case and weighs the same so what makes it a LANbox? I guess because it is more box shaped than rectangular. If I was naming it I would call it a ""weighted companion cube"". I also had problems with the wiring being too short to fit my front panel connectors."
5,Heartwarming,This book has many heartwarming stories. It really discribes the way veterinary work was handled years ago. Mr. Herriot is a great story teller.
5,They're Human Being Stories Too,"In has been roughly two decades since I read James Herriot's salubrious ""All Creatures..."" series, yet when I picked up this ""best of"" concoction, many of the dulcet vignettes were as fresh in my mind as if I had lived them last week. Although trained as a vet, James Herriot had a true gift with the written word. These tales about pets and their two-legged counterparts shine a light deep into the mechanisms of human nature.While he succeeded admirably as an honorable animal doctor and found worldwide fame as a late-in-life author, perhaps he missed his true calling as a psychologist. The humor, heartbreak, and humanity that he so eloquently captures in these stories shows a sagacious mind. It's no wonder that his time on earth brought many smiles and caused many a tail to wag."
5,One of the best,"Easy reading, great subjects . Would recommend it to anyone. Am passing it around in the family. Great bit of humor."
5,"Great product, price & delivery","Really like using landscape plastic versus the landscape fabric sold in home improvement stores. The plastic does a much better job of killing the weeds below while preventing new weeds- the fabric sold in stores is more expensive and the root system of weeds actually thrive along the material. 4MIL black plastic is my favorite to use with stones especially. Product well priced, good quality, great shipping and made in the USA."
5,Ocean's 11,Poster was in perfect condition and it was sent to me in just a few days! Great Seller! A+
3,Warning,"It took a while to get going but once it did, I could not put this book down. However, be warned: ***spoiler alert*** if you have read Tess of the D'Urbervilles and didn't like the way it ended, do not read this book."
5,Doctors can they be trusted,This is a great true life story of doctor being deceptive with his patients. Melissa Gilbert does a great job in this movie as the victim of this arrogant doctor.
1,"great songs, horrible sound transfer","It is simply not worth wasting your money even on songs of the sixties so fine as these, since the sound qualities of this disc are so poor as to completely ruin the listening experience. I used to have this on vinyl lp and should have kept it. The sound was great back then. The CD is nothing but scratches and hisses. Disgraceful."
5,Trust the teller along with the tale,"This is a small book yet Lawrence's genius enables him to see big things in it, especially about those large writers like Melville he felt an affinity to. ""Trust the tale and not the teller"" is one of his motto's here and he tries to show how the great works go beyond the intentions of their creators.One objection. He is especially hard on Franklin who he makes into a priggish, petty prune of a minor moralist. Franklin was a many - sided genius who was open to kind of creation Lawrence had no sense of."
4,Always interesting but often wrong,"This passionate brief survey of American Literature contains much spontaneous flowing masterful and original writing. Lawrence famous 'Trust the teller not the tale' is the motto of the work. It argues that the true creative work takes on a life of its own that even its creator cannot completely define and control.Perhaps the most famous essay in this book is Lawrence's hatchet- job of Ben Franklin who he found to be a spiteful, penny- pinching, calculating dead soul. In fact old Ben could be in certain places as lively and probably more lively than Lawrence himself.What however is most important is that Lawrence in this work understands the great subterranean and mysterious genius of a kindred spirit for him, the literary creator of the Great White Whale."
1,Not what I ordered,"The statue pictured is not what the recipient got! I wish that this company would show exactly what they are shipping, not what is pictured here. I will not order from this company again."
5,My son loves this shirt and wears it weekly!,It was a perfect form fit for my 11 year old. We bought the small and it fits exactly how he likes it.
1,Material fell apart after 6 to 8 wears,"I purchased one of these shirts from Sport Check and paid $30 for it. It was comfortable and I had no problems with it until 1 day I noticed some white flakes on the front of it. When I tried to wipe them off I saw that it was the material that was flaking off in a perfect circle. The more I brushed the bigger the hole grew. Now you can see through the center of my shirt like some nylon stockings, which looks pretty girly. For a $30 shirt I sure expected to get a lot more wear out of it."
1,Under Armour Heat Gear,"This is the first time I've had anything negative to say about Under Armour,and my complain is not really about the product, but the company, as the 2 shirts I ordered was to be short sleeved, and they arrived as sleeveless,It was a birthday gift to my grandson, and he assured me it was OK. I went along with him, but when I received this letter asking if I would rate the transaction, I had to tell you.I will think twice before I order again, this was a plain and simple order, and you messed it up.If I had had time I would have returned them for the right kind, but they were delivered on the birthday so I gave the package to him as it arrived,ibg1105"
4,The best compression shirt,This is probably the best compression t-shirt in the market... I used Nike pro Ultimate before and I have to say that this one is far better in terms of compressing your body... it fits perfectly however the length of the t-shirt is pretty short for me... I wear size s ... I think the new design it's better than the one in terms of fitting... I think Under Armour really listen to customers and continue to provide great products to customers ....Personally I think short sleeve t-shirt is more convenience than the long sleeve t-shirt since most of the time you gonna wear it underneath your t-shirt...
4,boyfriend loves it,"I purchased this for my boyfriend who is a marathon runner and weight lifter. He wears it on his shorter, usually 10 mile runs, and also in the gym. I like the way he looks it in, he likes the feel. I purchased the dark green and it seems to fit true to size. Will probably purchase another for Christmas."
3,too tight,"I love UA products and buy only compression fit. I am a medium at 155 lbs. 5'7"". I ordered a large and it was way too tight in the armpits due to the shortness of the sleeves. Hence the reason why UA is now making them with the longer sleeves. I wish they would carry the 3/4 sleeve more."
5,Great,Great shirts. I bought this for work and they work great they keep me dry and fresh when its not
4,Very thin,The shirt was for my husband. It was very thin and can be used under some other stuff but he wouldn't wear it by itself.
2,Runs Small!,"Nice shirt but runs really small. I understand they are to be worn tight, but my 14 year old couldn't get it over his head. Have to return it."
2,Men's heatgear compression shortsleeve T-shirt,"I did not expect this top to be skin tight. The other Armour exercise shirt I have is a comfortable fit. It is partly my own fault because I did not realize the significance of ""compression"" fit."
2,Way too small!,"Great shirt in most respects, but way too small. I bought the Adult Small for my 12-year-old son, who is 5 ft even, 115 lbs, and it is so skin-tight he could barely breathe in it. I'm exchanging it for the non-compression version."
5,A good product,"I got the XL size and found it was a little tighter than I thought it would be. I would get an XXL next time around, but otherwise it's a great product."
4,Keeps my pizza belly from sloshing around during workouts,With any luck I won't need these to hold the belly before long. I just have to keep up my will power and keep excerizing.
4,"Good, but size runs small","The quality is good, but be aware that Under Armour shirts tend to run very small and tight. Since I always wear medium, I ordered a medium but it was way too tight and I needed a large."
3,Beautiful-but defective,"12-26-11:Well I must say the rod is beautiful, lightweight, and seems very strong, however when I put the 2 parts together I noticed that the second largest guide was not aligned with the other guides. It was the second largest guide that was offset about 1/2 an inch. Of course I re-packed the rod, filled out the return paperwork, printed a label and mailed back this morning. Of course Amazon paid for the return shipping. I recieved a very prompt email from Amazon saying that they have already processed a replacement rod with estimated arrival time 12/30. This is why I do business with Amazon. I do believe this rod will be most excellent for the amount paid. I will provide an update after I recieve the new rod.UPDATE:12-29-11Well I sent the package baqck via UPS as instructed by Amazon on 12-26-11. I recieved the replacement this afternoon via FedEx 12-29-11. The rod is very nice, I think I will really enjoy it this early spring if not sooner."
4,Shades of Gray,"After watching this film, I enjoyed it to the point of tracking down my own copy. If you're a firm, die-hard believer in UFO's and the array of sub-cultures that have sprung up as a result of the first reports back in 1947, you won't like this film. If, however, you are interested in examining some of the people behind the phenomena of the modern-day UFO, and especially the Men in Black reports, this film is a must have. Be aware it is a bubble-bursting, serious look at the lives of Gray Barker and some of his contemporaries. These are the people who nearly single-handedly have set a place in history for the modern UFO enigma. It's funny, it's sad, and it is definitely eye-opening."
5,Shades of Gray,"Great awareness raised on the real person, Gray Barker, who is responsible for the making of hollowood movies that we have enjoyed. I did not want to miss a second of this documentary. Applause for a well thought out and put together documentary. Great Job!!!!"
3,Shades of Gray,"This was also a Gift. I suppose they liked it. I haven't had any complaints from the recipient. Therefore, I assume they liked it."
1,SHADES OF GRAY,"I HAVE READ, LISTENED TO AND VIEWED 100'S OF BOOKS, MOVIES ETC. SHADES OF GRAY VIDEO IS BY FAR THE ABSOLUTE WORST PURCHASE I'VE EVER MADE. THE BOOK HOWEVER PROMISES TO BE SUPERIOR READING BY ALL ACCOUNTS, I ENDORSE THE BOOK IN ADVANCE TRUST ME. I AM ABSOLUTELY MIFFED AT THE INFERIOR QUALITY OF THE DVD WHICH ALLEGES TO SERVE AS A PRELUDE IN SOME WAY. I MAY NEVER PURCHASE AGAIN FROM AMAZON BECAUSE OF THIS VIDEO. ALL OTHER MATERIAL AND SHIPPING ISSUES HAVE BEEN SUPERIOR. I LOST 10.00 ON THE VIDEO."
3,Stirring up the Waters,"Is it actually possible that pristine 1966 LP copies of THE REAL FOLK BLUES contained the same anomalies as this MCA/CHESS CD? Were that album's tracks 2, 5, 6, 8 and 11 equally filled with surface wear and crackle? Back then, did CHESS records not have clean sides available for mastering this Muddy Waters compilation? And is owning the more recent double album two-fer worth it if 40% of the tracks are far from perfect? That decision must be left up to the individual. You can't fault the performances, regardless of iffy masters.Eight page booklet includes bio, session personnel and original LP notes written by Wille Dixon.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 34:48"
4,Woke up this morning,"This album by Muddy Waters was released in 1966. It was basically released to capitalize on the folk and blues revivals (hence the title). The songs consist of a random assortment of songs that had not previously been on an album. The songs were recorded between 1949 and 1964, so the album doesn't really have a uniform sound to it. The older tracks are pretty worn out and scratchy sounding. Despite the audio shortcomings of this CD, there are a lot of classic performances here. If you can find a cheap copy of this CD, it will be worth picking up."
4,Muddy is Clear,"Someone reviewed this CD and said it was Muddy's best and I beg to differ. ""Hard Again"" is probably his best CD but this one is very good. The selections are all well known but it doesn't matter. If you like the blues and appreciate the various nuances that performers can add to their presentation then you know that no matter how many times you hear Muddy perform, say, ""Mannish Boy"" (No B ooh chile), each time presents a different revelation. McKinley Morganfield, through his music, remains a giant."
3,factual but unedited,"I read this book cover -to -cover, eager to find out all I could about my ancestor Samual Adams. This unedited version was tedious to read due to it's many spelling errors and interruptive footnotes in the middle of paragraphs. I would be interested to read an edited version if one is ever published. Needs to be reformatted for Kindle readers. The content was factual and interesting."
2,Not impressed,"I have tried similar products in the past, but wasn't very satisfied. After reading the excellent reviews for this one, i gave it a try. I am disappointed. Even though it comes in precut shapes and is cold wax, it did not do a very good job on my eybrows. It left a lot of hairs. The shape of the precut wax strips isn't very good neither - it didn't match my eybrows very well. My conclusion so far from my experience with at home wax products is that nothing does as good of a job as you get in a salon."
1,Does not work,"These strips are nothing more than scotch tape in the shape of eyebrow removers. They may take off one or two hairs, but they don't come close to doing what they are supposed to."
1,Hair Off Instant Eyebrow Shapers Cold Wax Strips 18's,Hair Off Instant Eyebrow Shapers Cold Wax Strips 18's didn't really did not work for me so I will not be buying this brand anymore
1,Don't work:(,"They don't work!!! It pulls the hair, it just doesn't take it off... Maybe it works different for other people, but they did not work for me."
2,Hair Off Instant Eyebrow Shapers Cold Wax Strips 18's,This product does not live up to all its claim. It doesn't work! It barely takes off the hair from my eyebrows.
1,Stupid,I bought these because I read a bunch of positive reviews but they really suck! They look like little pieces of tape and they barely remove any hair. I don't recommend this product to anyone.
4,"Good, but one size does not fit all!","I got some like this at a store. I like them a lot, BUT the shape they give you may or may not fit your eyebrow shape. I had to use scissors and trim each one to fit MY eyebrow shape. Have to use more than one to get it all. Once you cut them to your size they do work really well.Easy and fast."
5,Fast,Really works and is convenient. I don't have to go to the salon anymore. The cold wax is more effective than hot wax.
1,Absolute Waste,I purchased this product last week and discovered that it was garbage. The strips shape is terrible and it does not remove the hair. Complete waste.....:(
1,Not impressed,"This product didn't work as well as I had hoped. It doesn't hurt, but it also doesn't remove all of the hair. I had to go behind and pluck my eyebrows (even longer hairs that should have been picked up by the strips). Save your money and buy wax instead."
5,great product,product disappeared from store shelves here. Glad to find them online. Very quick and easy to use.
1,As good as duct tape,"You might as well wax your eyebrows with duct tape - it is cheaper and will produce the same results as this product. This stuff pulls as much skin off as it does hair, so beware."
3,Convenient & quick,"These are best for quickly removing those tiny hairs that are super annoying to & impossible to pluck with tweezers. While you won't get every hair (you might have to do the same area twice to get some missed hairs), they are a much cheaper alternative to a pricy salon. My main gripe with these is that they leave an impossible amount of residue which can only be taken off with special oil (like Azulene). Overall, not too shabby for the price."
2,Expectations too high?,"I guess I am guilty of having too high an expectation, or maybe just stubborn hair. Either way I am not impressed. I still have to tweeze after using the strips. I made the initial mistake of trying to use the stipps repeatedly on the same area when the the strips didn't get it all the first time....big mistake. I'll use them to do an overall, but tweezing is still necessary.Maybe I just didn't hold my mouth right..."
1,useless,It does not work at all! Or if I used it wrong? Anyway I threw away the whole box. Waste of money.
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought this in hopes of getting nicely DIY shaped eyebrows and avoiding the hassle of spending $20 every 3 weeks to get my eyebrows painfully waxed. I followed the instructions and had an oil/dirt free face when I tested this product. Everything was going great until I pulled the strips off. They didn't work. The strip pulled my hair but did not remove it. I don't think that they were sticky enough or I didn't press down on them hard enough to stick completely. On the bright side, this was cheap when I purchased it."
5,Great watch,"Its a great watch for one with a smaller wrist. I have the Storm which has served me well since 1996 (which i hope they can repair, with a new batterry). I wear it every day doing heavy duty Construction Reno's after my years of Diving. These are serious watches (whether diving/swimming or doing serious outdoor activities). An active outdoor guy watch"
5,You Nasty,"If you are an old Too Short fan, this album is just what you're looking for. But this cd is tighter than most of his albums. Just check it out and you'll know what I'm talking about."
3,jivetalkinmujer,too short that whipper shapper needs to stop talking about it and get rid of them betties.
2,Not the 2 short album to start with,"Suprised with all the positive reviews for this album, since this is one of Too Short's weaker albums. There are a few enjoyable tracks here, but nothing to write home about. ""Shorty the Pimp"" and ""Get in where you fit in"" are so much stronger, that this I wouldnt bother with this one."
4,Too $hort is the bomb!,"Personally, I thought Too $hort's last album was a bit weak...Some of the tracks were OK, but not great. This album is much better. Almost all the tracks are awesome, except the 4 and 8th. But the rest is awesome! I just bought this CD and I am totally happy bout it. Yea Oakland!"
3,Not his best album but...,"If you are a Too $hort fan like myself you will still like it. My favorite tracks are 5,7,8,and 12. Check it out Too $hort Fans, non-Too $hort fan.... well stick to albums 3-10.(Born to Mack thur Gettin it album 10)"
4,You Nasty,"Short remains steadfast w/this release. Production varies, even E. Sermon drops by w/a dope beat for Short to spit to. If you're a fan you will not be dissapointed. His lyrical pimp hand remains strong throughout the duration of the record. Add it to your collection! PEACE"
1,Horrible toy!,"I should have went by the reviews on this, but i didn't because my 2 boys (triplets) wanted this so bad I bought 2 of them.. They haven't even looked at them since X-mas... The fell apart and everything that was written about them was %100 TRUE! next time i make sure my decsion is based on the reviews.. What a waste of Money! they were $39.99 each at the time of my purchase. anyway i would not reccomend this toy at all."
2,this record hasn't aged well.,"I was living in England when it first came out and I thought it was pretty fun and catchy and fit in well with my surroundings. But the unimaginative beats, rote guitar solos and Liam's incessant whine started to grate after the while. ""Slide Away"" is still an excellent tune, but the rest...blah."
5,John & Paul WHO ?,"Definitely Maybe shows The Beatles what they were missing, that gutsiness to give the whole world the Vs. Kicking off with the rip roaring Rock 'n' Roll Star and ending with the lullaby that is Married With Children, this album is certainly the best thing Oasis have ever produced. Never mind all the hype and acclaim that came with Morning Glory, it could never match the extra punch that Definitely Maybe packs. Live Forever and Slide Away are the album's highlights and isn't it curious that from the bad's first three albums, the best song from each wasn't released as a single; Slide Away, Champagne Supernova and Fade In-Out. I'll bet Gas Panic! isn't a single!"
5,Live forever,"I didn't get into Oasis until the latter part of the '90s, but I can readily imagine how revolutionary their debut sounded to British audiences when it first came out. Combining a pummeling guitar surge with the melodicism of the Beatles and the psychedelic sensibilities of the Stone Roses, ""Definitely Maybe"" still sounds like a world-beater. From Britpop touchstone ""Shakermaker"" to riff monster ""Supersonic"" to the melancholy yet anthemic ""Slide Away,"" every track is an era-defining classic. Simply put, this is one of the landmark British debut albums of all time."
5,Transcendant,"Definitely Maybe ranks alongside Sgt. Pepper (concept), Murmur (College radio / alternative), Nevermind (grunge), Too Far to Care (alt country) as truly seminal works of rock and roll. This album single handedly resurrected Brit-pop and stimulated interest in a genre that was in dire need of a jolt of energy.In terms of debut, almost nothing compares to the end to end brilliance of Definitely Maybe. Amazing lyrics, otherworldly guitar by Noel, and the best chops in rock by Liam, culimating with the incredible ""Slide Away"".If you only own 10 CD's, this is a must."
1,rip off of the beatles,"what the hell is this. 5 loosers from enlgand trying to copy the beatles. i mean even there fans are so stuipid. i read one review which one of the oasis fans criticized thebeatles for being a rip off of OASIS. hello dude the beatles were 1963 and oasis is 1994. that should be enough to skip this album and get hte better of these clones THE BEATLES.r.i.P. JOHN LENNON, GEORGE HARRISONTHEY MUST BE TURNING IN THERE GRAVES"
5,"if you must buy a CD from Oasis, buy this one","the first one sometimes became the best one. If you must choose 5 bands from 90' of Brit-music, Oasis must be in the list, but not as the best band, they can be the second best while THE VERVE stand on the top of all. Columbia is the best song forever Oasis had made, i really believe this song and its guitar chords have the power to bring us to the other side of the time-tunel. If you love this album, why don't you try the best album of 90', A storm in the heaven of The Verve?"
5,A great combination of '90s in your face and '60s groove,"Oasis is one of the few bands that captures the essence of the '60s while maintaining their own style. This is what sets them apart from others that don't quite make it. Noel writes some of the greatest lyrics around, and Liam sings them in a fashion that grips the listener and makes 'em want more. The band is that good."
3,don`t believe the hype!,"The hype for this band is incredible . I always thought that great bands pushed the musical envelope back by adding new elements to the musical landscape , but Oasis add nothing . Far from being innovative , the music on this cd is derivative and oh so cliched . If their marketing ploy is to reach the lowest common denominator , they have succeeded admirably . I`m afraid the only form of music that they have created is dad rock , or should I say granddad rock ."
5,Liam and Noel's greatest hour,"I cant tell you what it is about this album that makes it so appealing. If anyone can put thier finger on the undefineable attraction of this musical masterpiece they deserve a round down at the dog and duck. Full of exceptional songs, this has to be a front runner for album of the 90's. Rock 'n' roll star is a great opener which is followed by Shakermaker, a real piece of psycadelica. Other tracks that are prominent are Supersonic (Oasis' first single) and Cigarettes and Alcohol. Others such as Up in the sky and Digsy's dinner are of high standard but it is (contrary to popular belief) Slide Away that is the weakest track of the lot. A must for any self respecting music conneseur. Amazing."
4,The First Is Their Best,"Although I like certain songs more on their later albums, Oasis shines on their debut ""Definitely Maybe"". Many of the songs on this album rock, and have an alternative feel to them. There's an energy here that Oasis doesn't quite match in it's latter efforts, and songs like ""Rock N' Roll Star"", ""Slide Away"", ""Columbia"" and ""Live Forever"" are just to name a few of the catchy, pop-rock anthems that you'll find on the album. This would be my pick for the definitive Oasis album."
4,Giving in isn't always bad,"i don't like oasis. their brand of pretty petulance annoys me for reasons that i honestly can't explain. i've proudly dismissed their popularity and have remained faithfully not a fan. instead, many other brit pop acts have had my attention and dollars: supergrass, suede, super furry animals, radiohead, to name a few.the oasis 'behind the music' on vh1 made references to the more raw, energy-packed ""definitely maybe"". possibly because i got tired of disliking them, i went out (wearing a good disguise) and bought the album.thankfully, it is all that i had hoped it would be. powerful and bold in attitude, strong songwriting with catchy hooks, and very little of the 'pretty petulance' i've disliked in everything else i've heard up until hearing ""definitely maybe"".so, to all the oasis non-believers: i recommend it. to all the oasis die-hards who have yet to hear this one: be careful, it might scare you a bit. it's certainly not wimpy and can probably beat you up!"
3,a few gems in the muck...,"I am NOT an Oasis fan. I bought this album back in '94 when it came out, and have not desired any of their newer albums. Liam's voice is a turn-off, and this style of Britpop is not my favorite. But here we have ""Supersonic"", a marvelously catchy pop tune, and ""Bring It On Down"", which injects some much needed punk energy into the stew. ""Digsy's Diner"" is a happily 60's-esqe tune, but most of the rest seem mired in guitar slop and repetition. I do appreciate this album's rawness, which seems absent on subsequent releases."
5,maybe your the same as me we'll see things they'll never see,"There is not a lot to say, my mates.This one of the best debut albums ever.RocknRoll Star is a very good song,but I fooking like Live Forever, in my opinion the demo versionof this song is better.Supersonic, a fooking good one, too.All in all the the lads from manchestermade a fooking good album.Cheers! Stevie"
5,"Great Album, Fastest selling album in music history!!!!!!!!!","Wow, when I first heard this album, it changed my outlook on music forever! The rocking melodies and lyrics on this album are what make it good. This album rivals Be Here Now with it's greatness. OASIS ARE THE BEST!!!!!!!"
4,One Big Crunch,"Want to rock'n roll all night and party every day? Then this album is a must for your stereo. And even though the lyrics to ""Digsy's Dinner"" can be pretty silly, the catchy tune will grow on you."
5,Oasis is the best band in the world!,"Slide Away, Supersonic, and Live Forever are some of the best songs ever. but that's not suprising, since Oasis is one of the best bands in the world! I mean, Noel is a genius, Liam's voice is beautiful and Bonehead, Whitey and Guigsy are amazing. If you buy this CD, you're gonna have the best time of your life."
2,60's revisionism filtered through a nasal whine,"On the basis of critical raves for this album, I bought it to see what all the fuss was about for Oasis. I came away surprised that this album garnered such rave reviews. This is basically 60's plagiarism combined with a snotty Johnny Rotten attitude, complete with sneering, nasally whining by the lead singer. This gets pretty old fast. Yes, I know Oasis has exploded in popularity since this first album. Yes, I know the critics seem to love them. Sorry, not very impressed. Oh, and by the way, the band members are shamefully cocky, insufferable JERKS!"
4,Oasis's most definite.,"I have recently bought Oasis's Definitely Maybe album as a DUAL-CD, where one side of the CD is the album and the other side is a DVD. The DVD stuff is pretty cool and hilarious at times, especially with this one crazy British guy, who keeps on flipping-out during the interviews. Definitely Maybe is a great album to own, but you know...I always had one problem with it and that is the recording quality itself. The album just sounds muffled! I can't believe recordings from the early 90's already sound a bit primitive now a days, even though they are on CD's. I began to notice this with a lot of my albums from the early and mid 90's. Although, I think Definitely Maybe was recorder with a style/techniques that makes it sound even more muffled. Oh well, it's still a great album and most DEFINITELY Oasis's best."
1,On behalf of Britain I am deeply sorry.,"This is an obscenely derivative album which basically amounts to some not very talented people revamping Mrs Gallagher's record collection and passing it off as their own. If only they'd been American, maybe someone would have called the lawyers and done away with this formulaic, monotone drivel.I would suggest you go back to the search box and look up the original artists instead - T Rex, The New Seekers and,of course, The Beatles. Also recommended is R.E.M.s 'The Wake-Up Bomb' which derides them nicely."
1,Thank god they were given a 2nd chance after this one,"Loved ""whats the story.."" so recently 4/05 got this CD. I cant believe its the same band. DM is boring and whiny and I can hardly listen to it all the way through. ""whats the story.."" is so much more inspired and less nasaly. Im glad I didnt hear it first or I never would have gotten the 2nd one. Music isnt that good either"
1,"""Definitely Maybe"" definitely stinks...","This has to be their most overrated album. ""Live Forever"" however is a song that must not be ignored. It is probably one of Oasis's best songs to date. ""Slide Away"" and ""Married with Children"" are decent but are far from amazing. I suggest to just buy the single."
1,RUBBISH,"THE LP DEFINITELY MAYBE, AND ITS EVIDENT SUCCESS, IS A SYMBOL OF THE CULTURE OF MEDIOCRITY WHICH ENSWATHES BRITISH CULTURE. IT IS BUT ONE EXAMPLE OF THE FALL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM FROM GREATNESS TO LAUGHING STOCK."
2,monstrously overrated..,"what the hell is it with americans? why cant they like GOOD music?> this band is awful, theres only one good song on this and that's the anthemic live forever, which is about the closest they got to a decent tune. every other song is idiotic, bash you over the head with a repeated riff rock that shouldn't ever be compared to the beatles EVER. the gallagher brothers are crap, in their attitude, their look and their songs. this is crappp. morning glory is a good album i admit, and that will be the only reason people care about them,,,,accept and move on"
3,"Good, but In Extremo's worst CD is better","Ok..the songs are not bad by any measure but the lead singer sings too quietly in my opinion and the songs lack the metal quality that In Ex has. If you enjoy purely medieval music buy this CD..but if you want a groundbreaking, breathtaking rock/medieval music fusion then listen to the best group out there (one of the best in my humble opinion): IN EXTREMO!!!"
4,Thank goodness for my i-pod!,A perfect blend of medieval/ren faire hard/soft music. Ditto to the other reviews. Thank goodness I can listen through my i-pod otherwise this cd might be thrashed by now! On live the warriors!
3,Mideval Metal,"They bill themselfes as ""the Rolling Stones of the Middle Ages"", but they are more like Motley Crue. Definitely Celtic, but high-energy thrashing, not beautiful. You've gotta like it hard get into this. I own a couple of their albums and listen occasionaly. For something lighter, try ""Faun""."
3,UK Records Singles Collection,"UK Records Singles Collection being a compilation of 10 cc and contains all their singles released 1972-1974. 10 cc's sound is a mix of pop, rock, art rock and soft rock. The booklet contains all the sleeves for the singles and linernotes written by Mark Brennan. The compilation is uneven with good tracks such as ""Waterfall"" and ""18 Carat Man of Means"", ""Wall Street Shuffle"". The earlier tracks sound silly and first I thought the song ""Donna"" was a parody. 3/5."
5,Great for keeping stuff from little kids.,"I have a 1 year old and a 3 year old. The 1 year old can't open the can, the 3 year old has enough trouble that the adventure isn't worth it. So all the icky goodies stay in the can and not all over the house."
1,Big Come Up > Big RIP OFF,"After I saw these guys on Conan O' Brien...I could not help to think ""What a rip off...these guys are trying to be this new ""raw simple rock"" so many bands (White Stripes, The Strokes) are doing. This just affirms the whole belief about the time we live in: ""If it was popular once...you will see it again"""
3,Sincere Blues,"They're certain to hate it, but Akron's The Black Keys are going to be compared to The White Stripes. Which is shorthand for: they're a combo that adores the blues. On The Big Come Up, guitarist/vocalist David Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney sound like they stepped out of the Mississippi delta listening to John Lee Hooker (vibe), Creedence Clearwater Revival (structure), Jimi Hendrix (vocals i.d.), and, um, DJ Shadow (rhythms). In a rock season where everything old is new again, it remains to be seen whether this twosome produces work that will hold up in the blues canon. Yet they never seem inauthentic in their retro leanings - sincerity counts for a lot with the basics. In five years time, The Big Come Up might sound just as good as any other great blues joint that seems old as the hills and immediate as tomorrow's news."
4,stripped down rock,"Butt shaking music. If you like bluesy rock you'll love this. Not as refined as there 3rd Cd, much more primitive. Drums and guitar. Play it loud."
5,A ton of fun,So much fun to play! The black key's first album is true blues and full of soul. and it's a limited edition 180 gram vinyl.
5,Won't leave CD player,"Ok seriously folks, friends of mine turned me onto this stuff and this CD (The Big Come Up) is the greatest thing I've heard yet! I can't tell you what an unbelievable mix of blues/garage rock it is, even if you're not totally into that genre-I promise you WILL NOT be disappointed. This never leaves my cd player and my friends all play this at their parties (at NYU). The guitar and drumming beats are so raw and rough which is fantastic and is a great and perfect complement to Dan's smooth strong voice. Play this cd from beginning to end and you'll swear by it. The song ""I'll Be Your Man"" has Dan swooning you over making you believe he is singing right to you, but fret not you rockers because ""The Breaks"" will move you and groove you. These two hip guys know how to do things right and I can't wait for them to come to NYC!! Hear they are awesome live and I'm sure it helps that they are as attractive as they are talented! I say goodbye to MTV ... and hello to The Black Keys!"
5,the black keys are a very good band,hi all i want to say i like the black keys the 1st time i heard them was on punk-0-rama 8 which is a good cd also so anyways the black keys were on that cd and ever since then ive been wanting to hear more and more of there music its a mix of classical rock thing and blues and kinda the whole hendix thing the black keys were inspierd by led zephlin sooo thats all i have to say oh yeah i like white stripes there a good band too
3,Bruised Blues,"Pragmatically getting the job done of equal parts rockin and bluesin, yet somehow managing to reinturpret some of the oldest sounds in the book and make it sound hip to indie ears is a hard feat indeed. Few bands play with such lack of pretense and irony that it is utterly refreshing in it's sincerety to here these guys do what they do. There is a definite repetition of sound that can bog the disc down, but that self-less raw-ness always seems to kill the monotony, especially on those few hard hitting songs with insanely delicious riffs in all their tonal simplicity."
2,They done been listenin' to dat hill country stuff,"Obviously these guys have invested heavily into the North Mississippi hill country blues of R.L., Junior Kimbrough et al, via the Fat Possum catalog. Although it is mildly entertaining, why spend your filthy lucre on the imitation stuff when you can have the real deal? Search out the real innovators of this sound, they've been doing it a lot longer (and better) with more soul and authenticity than the boys from Akron."
2,ho hum....yawn,"i heard this cd while hanging out in some cd stores in boulder colorado. over their system it sounded great....kind of a stripped down j.s.blues explosion. i then had several long days of driving to get into it. the more i listened, the less i liked it. now, several months later it never makes it out of my stack of 1500 cds. in fact, i am thinking of moving it to the ever rotating pile of cds to trade. i guarantee that most of you will never listen to this cd more than a year from now....there just isn't enough there to hold one's attention. white guys doing stripped down blues is nothing new or radical or interesting. listen to the originals (hooker, guy, waters, harpo, wells, rev.gary davis, hopkins, wolf....)....they are much more interesting. If white blues is what you crave, search out peter green (hot foot powder) or go for the funkier js blues explosion (completely unlike the other artists i mention above)."
2,I want my $15 back!,"Why is it every album up for review on AMZN has a 4+ feedback level? It's an anomaly of our era I guess. Which makes it all the tougher to discern the true artistic gems from the abundance of turds shat by the corporate oligarchy. These guys have litle to say and it shows. The rifts are half-assed catchy and that is the extent of their offering. Damn, the mediocrity that is heralded as the 2nd coming of Jesus is becoming quite tiring!"
5,Track list,"Once again, Amazon has failed to provide the track list for a CD in their inventory, so here it is....The Black Keys ~ ""The Big Come Up""1. Busted (2:34)2. Do The Rump (2:38)3. I'll Be Your Man (2:21)4. Countdown (2:39)5. The Breaks (3:01)6. Run Me Down (2:27)7. Leavin' Trunk (3:00)8. Heavy Soul (2:09)9. She Said, She Said (2:32)10. Them Eyes (2:23)11. Yearnin' (1:59)12. Brooklyn Bound (3:11)13. 240 Years Your Time (23:21)"
5,Raw.,"I was introduced to the Black Key's through they're most recent album, Brothers. Loving what I heard, I snapped up Rubber Factory and The Big Come Up. I have to say, this might be my favorite of the three. Each album has it's fine points, but this one in particular has a rough, almost bootlegged quality of sound to it. Each track is filled with an infectious raw energy that's hard to resist. And ""Breaks"" is probably my favorite Key's song to date--a catchy-ass screeching guitar lick loops over an almost hip-hop sounding drum beat. Then Auerbach's voice slides in, smooth as ice, and I can't pull the grin off my face."
3,Indie,"Great band with a an original sound and infectious attitude. This disk has a few great tracks but is surprisingly short (very short). Distortions & 2nd Foot Stomp are worth buying it for, although there are several tracks where Clinic just seem to be messing around. It's production is very indie, which adds to the charm a bit, but it's not a cheap price for what you get. Overall - this is a band that should only get better."
4,Clinic put brit rock under surgeons knife,Wow. At last a british band shows some spirit and produces some prime geek rock. Internal wrangler is a fine slice of alternative rock in the tradition set by the likes of DEVO and Velvet Underground.All songs are strong and the zesty feel of the likes of the title track and others give some energy to the proceedings. It would be nice if their variety expanded but all in all this is a treat for those tired of formulaic rock or repetitive dance music.
3,Mannered,"Although Clinic initially appear insufferably mannered, 'Internal Wrangler' is just about inspired enough to work. It's still very self-consciously whimsical, though - from the meaningless, Cocteau Twins-esque lyrics to the tremulous lead singer to the cha-cha-cha drume machine - but the bizarre diversity of the set makes such NME-friendly posing forgivable. Sounding like a cross between Babybird, Tortiose and a random indie band from 1995, this is hard to classify - one track appears to the Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata with crunches, whilst the short instrumental filler tracks are interesting enough to work on their own. Mostly the songs are vocal, and evoke a mood rather than a specific portrait. Try them before they go the way of Gay Dad."
1,Book not received,I have filed a claim for a refund. The book was never received and the seller did not respond to my 3 emails.
3,Worth Reading,"It is not easy to put yourself out there in print for the first time. Anyone who does so is brave (and a little crazy). That being said, the writer shows promise in his work. ""How to Make a Man Cuddle"" is original and thoroughly entertaining. As you go through the book, you can see that the writer is struggling to find his voice. He would do well to continue to explore his comedic voice - it's something he excels at."
1,Somewhat creative but thoroughly uninspired,This stuff is easily the most trite and cliche collection of prose on love and romance that I've ever read. I was expecting a good deal more. The writing seems to come from the mindset of an intellectually arrested suburban kid who hasn't experienced much of life or the world beyond his college campus and his few so-called love affairs.
5,A TERRIFIC BOOK!,"If you have read ""The Four Agreements"", you will not want to miss this excellent and energizing companion book. Like ""The Four Agreements"", much of the content in this book is based on Eastern philosophies and attaining personal freedom and happiness. This book expands upon ""The Four Agreements"" by indicating one's life is a dream, a dream that is often dictated by others. In this light, ""domestication"" is seen as the root of human suffering.There is much to be learned from the Toltec way, and I highly recommend both this book and ""Awakening the Buddha Within"" by Lama Surya Das. There is much truth and food for thought contained in both these excellent, spiritually refreshing books. The wisdom learned gives direction to the reader on a path towards a more peaceful, serene and happy life."
1,Overkill,"While I absolutely love the four agreements and return to the original book often, I found the companion book to be completely unnecessary. The writing style was poor and rambled in circles, constantly repeating itself. There was no new information at all. I seemed to me to be a way to get a little more money out of the concept - shocking considering the author.I did enjoy the last few pages of personal examples from people who had incorporated the four agreements into their lives.If you have the four agreements original book, you don't need this one and if you don't then skip this one and get the original."
3,Nothing special.,"I bought this book in conjunction with The Four Agreements... A friend recommended that I buy both books. I was disappointed.As previously mentioned in my review of The Four Agreements, the books are easy to read, but I do not see anything special in the topics discussed throughout the book. Not to mention that topics/explanations seems redundant. I will not recommend to friends."
2,Ancient Wisdom or Pop Psychology?,"Whether ancient wisdom or pop psychology - the principles for keeping yourself in good emotional health are essentially the same. The Four Agreements is a restatement of the rules that if we would follow, would lead to happier, healthier lives. ...Our collective pursuit of the answer to that question has made for some very wealthy psychologists and psychaitrists. ..."
5,Wonderful Book!!!,This is a great book about a girl who gets captured by Delaware Indians I loved it sooo much I suggest it to anyone who loves to read about pioneer life!
4,Popular with middle school students,"This book was one of the most popular on the shelf for independent reading this year, with both male and female middle school students. Perhaps it was because it is based on an actual event. Perhaps the straight forward language used by the author appealed. Whatever the reason, as a teacher, I make note of any book that motivates students to read, and this one did."
3,Good case but bad clip,"Perfect metal case protect PDA as expected, but plastic clip was broken after 2 monthes of active usage."
4,Happy with the product,I have had the case for a month now and I am very happy with it so far. The case holds my TX nicely. No problems with the belt clip either. Very good product for the price.
4,"Great protective armor case, better than the original case.","I think that it simply does what the manufacturer says it does, which is to protect the Palm, and in my case I've found that it is so. I use my Palm in my pants pockets, and I like the fact that it does not get scratches at all, like the Palm original aluminum case. It does not rattle the Palm because it fits snuggly, unlike the original case. It has a back opening for the tiny speaker, so I think you can hear alarms louder. I've used mine for a month and I haven't have any problem with the plastic hinges that others described. It is somewhat difficult to open, though, that's why I give it 4 stars. You can charge and synch the Palm without open this case, unlike the original one. I do recommend it."
2,so-so,"My TX fit well and is well protected, but-The slide-groove holder is made of grossly inadequate thin brittle plastic and it broke off right away, so the TX may fall out.andThe hinge-pin starts to work its way out and I have to push it back in every few days"
2,Design Flaw,"Bought two of these and it always breaks in the same place after several months of use, if not sooner. Other reviewers have had the same experience. The problem lies with the plastic slide where you attach your Palm. It is flimsy and not detailed properly re. interface with the metal case itself. It invariably breaks after several openings/closings, if not before. I had a Rhino case before on another Palm and it looks as if I will have to try that or a leather one again."
2,Difficult to open.,"Looks great and very sturdy, unfortunately is not very easy to pry open. If you need to open it constantly during the day, not a smooth process."
1,BROKE MY PALM TX!!!!!!!,"Their DEFECTIVE product caused my palm tx to BREAK! I used the armor case and the belt clip that came with it the very day I got the package. My palm fell on the ground! Turns out the screw at the back of the armor case which was attatched to the belt clip was loose. Now my palm is broken. I emailed boxwave and this is the reply I got: ""Our liability policy prevents us from providing additional compensation for it. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you.""- All they offered was to replace the DEFECTIVE armor case with another one. As if I would ever trust their product again!!!"
2,Bulky and heavy,Protection was my intention but I ended up carrying a brick in my pocket! It was easier to just carry the Palm TX without the cover. This was more of obstacle than protection.
4,like,Very sturdy case. I have a little difficulty opening the case without moving the palm pilot upwards. Also not easy to open latch. But the sleek design fits well inside pocket or purse. Opening at bottom is perfect access for charging the device.
3,Acceptable,"The aluminum case was disappointing. It looks like black plastic. Two of us struggled and struggled to get the Palm TX to fit in the case. After repeated attempts, we gave up and I e-mailed Boxwave. Finally after reading someone else's review, I realized that the funny piece in the middle of the case was supposed to slide into the TX. It worked fine after that. The box was labeled for the Palm Tungsten, not the TX. Simple instructions with the case, would've saved me a couple of hours of fiddling and e-mails. I agree with another reviewer who said the case is slippery also. I probably would not buy this again, but will keep it now that I have it."
1,Not good for the Palm TX,"I just got the newest version of the Palm TX--and I'm not sure if they've changed the dimensions or anything--but this case does not close when I put my Palm TX in it. That's right, it doesn't work with the new TX. There is a small piece of plastic that is supposed to keep the palm in the case, but this is preventing the case from closing because the palm is too large.FYI. I will probably keep the product and just break off the little piece of plastic. But just so you know, don't buy this hardcase if you're getting a NEW Palm TX (with wi-fi and such)."
5,really are ARMOR CASE,"I think this product is a must have for those people who need simplicity to carry on your palm TX, and who wants to have a nice looking, excelent finishing and confortable case. I am satisfied about it and I feel more confortable than the existing PALM hard case.hope it would be useful for other customers"
3,Mediocre,All the usual gambling stereotypes: the shylock who crushes your fingers for not paying; the chronic gambler whose world is about to come crashing down; the politician in debt to the loan sharks etc etc. Ho hum. Unknown cast and predictable script make this just so-so entertainment for an off-night's watching.
3,Life style of the Young and Foolish,"Really about how not to live to a ripe old age.A young stock broker gets into a lower level bookie( a leg breaker type), while betting on football games.One injury can make or break a football team.I wish this didn't remind me of somebody in my own friends.Gambling like drugs will get you...ruin the goodlife you could have.To Vegas and get back by dinner, oh, sure.Get out of there while you can... stupid, stupid, stupid.Beat up his wife and wants his house.A bomb and federal agents..."
2,Aaaaaaak!!!! It's Dracula's Dog!!!,"I have the movie version of Dracula's Dog. I find it hard to believe that this story was actually in book AND movie form...hum.Anyway, my cousin bought this movie for me as a joke. How funny is it that there was actually a movie made called Dracula's Dog!? The funniest part is that the movie is supposed to be serious. The movie is soooooooo bad it's actually entertaining. I just can't believe I'm the first person to review this movie; hasn't everyone been haunted by Dracula's Dog?"
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"Buyer Beware: My Mom Loves her Mailstation but hers broke. I was So thrilled to see Amazon still offered them for sale! BUT...Earthlink would NOT transfer her service to a ""previously-owned or 'replacement' Mailstation device purchased from a third party"". I see now this is also stated on their Mailstation website. Wish I would've known this before purchasing."
1,"Terrible service, non-functioning product","Like the other reviewer, I began trying to make this thing work in December, for my grandmother. Since then it's been one run-around after another. The first had a broken screen; it took them weeks to send me a new one, then when I got that one and sent it to my grandmother, it didn't work. She spent all these hours on the phone with them trying to get it to work, and it wouldn't, so finally she sent it back to me. I tried to get a refund, and the Mailstation people wouldn't give it to me, because I was past the 30 day purchase limit. Terrible."
1,Who knows what this is?,"I bought this thinking it was a band with free jazz reed man, Peter Brotzmann. I was surprised that only two pieces feature him and the rest are Scandinavian polkas. This is the strangest thing. A polka after Brotzmann is enough to jar you for a long time.I returned mine for a refund."
4,Great Product,"Love the product b/c you can take it with you. However you can do a lot of the same things with theknot.com, Wedding Channel and other great sites online. But I still recommend this for any bride who wants to be organized. Could use a part on guest lists and how to pick them, sit them, etc."
1,disappointing....,"This book is certainly Reed's interpretation of Rimbaud. I found his interpretations to be a bit far reaching, and at times absurd. Reed often goes on into his own ""poetic"" rantings and all too often describes what he see's to be comparisons between his own life and that of Rimbaud. I had to force myself to finish this book. It was very disappointing. Any one interested in Rimbaud would do much better reading - Rimbaud- by Enid Starkie, or -Rimbaud- by Pierre Petitfils. Both are excellent."
1,sunk under the weight of its own pretentions,"I wanted to like this book, I really did. It's all artsy and rebellious, possibly like Rimbaud himself. But oh, it is pretentious! It's like Reed took a straight-up Rimbaud biography, a lot of half-baked hippie rants, some political and social arguements which would have probably left the real Rimbaud scratching his head, and stuffed it all in a blender. (Set on puree, dry to a paste, spread it on paper. Voila, this book.) This is more the author's screaming than anything relevant to Rimbaud. If you want an artistic representation of Rimbaud's life, watch ""Total Eclipse"". If you want a Rimbaud biography, pick any other; they're all better than ""Delirium""."
3,A Good Overview,"This is more like an introduction and overview than a guide or a reference. Having read the book, I'm still not sure that the author means a guide for attorneys, rather than a guide by an attorney.The upside is that it is a quick read and contains a lot of sensible-sounding advice. The downside is that it is poorly edited and lacking in depth. The forms at the end are badly labeled, badly laid out, and nearly illegible. Also, they are specific to New York Courts and would be difficult to translate to other states. Part of the problem is that the New York statutes and rules the forms are designed to satisfy are, for the most part, not identified. Advice for collecting out of state is mostly just ""hire local counsel.""Still, I would have paid to have lunch with the author to get his perspcetive on collections, and the book gives more than that for about the same cost in time."
1,Disjointed and full of typographic errors,"This was a big let down. The text was hard to follow. There were typographical errors everywhere, even on the first page. It looks like it was self-published. And probably self-editing, too. Save your money."
5,The Mother of All Happy Ends,"This is a wonderfully romantic, tearful, happy, love and friendship movie with great music and the greatest happy end of all times. Maybe you would like ""Love of Siam"" to be more open gay, but that would destroy its sweet-and-sour quality. If you haven't seen it, order it quickly! If in doubt watch the trailer on youtube first."
2,Love of Siam,"This budding romance is a bit...slow. I was a bit disappointed with the story line but then again, I find it quite difficult for Asians to do a well coming out or coming of age story. This is my opinion. I would reccomend that you save your money and not view it."
5,hope dies last studs terkel,once again studs has nailed it inspirational timely and speaks to me today as it did years ago how i miss him but his words are still alive today
3,"Not Baedeker, DK Eyewitness or Knopf Guide, but O.K.","The guide is almost entirely black & white except color three pages with 4 photos on each, one ""big"" country map on 2 pages, one small on one page, and 1 page with a desert sand photo. It includes over 50 schematics ranging from long maps occupying bottom halfs of two pages to tiny ones sized 1.5 x 1.5 inch. 33 of them are rudimentary maps, site plans, and antiquity plans. The rest are very rudimentary drawings with painted halftones of mainly buildings. In other words, its artwork is poor.The guide is written well and has excellent layout and typography determining its superior clarly and ease of browsing. The information is deap, extensive, practical, and useful including historical background. It is well published and bound. The softcover is sturdy and resilient. There are no similar guides from the industry leaders: Baedeker, DK Eyewitness or Knopf Guides."
2,4.5 inch heal wrap up rhinestone sandal,"I've never had an issue with purchases from amazon before...this one looked ok at first but as I looked closer I realized that a few of the rhinestones were missing, I read the return label and it seemed too much of a hassle to return it. These were suppose to be my wedding shoes...and now I won't be able to wear them."
4,GREAT!!,The shoe i ordered was the exact show that came in the mail and it actually came a couple days earlier. Great service for a good shoe!!
2,boring,"This exercise video is not fun--none of us like it. The moves are not hip or fun, and they become monotonous and boring, like you're waiting for it to end. It seems really old or outdated. The instructor is friendly and happy, but her face is really sweaty during the video. The sound quality is not the best. There must be a better kids' exercise video out there--we need some fun, hip, new moves with a great beat and really good music and alot more energy! This dvd is not worth it-invest in something else, like a huge exercise ball--we all love that!"
3,Not what I was thinking,My husband and I were looking for a two player game and while you can play with 2 people you can't go through the game as 2 people. You can only duel each other. As a one player game my grandkids loves it!!! The character of Johnny Depp is so funny and life like that I laugh at his moves all the time!!
2,1,"ive bought some cheap and bad games in my day but wow! really, this is the crappiest game i have ever bought. i finished it but was contastantly reminded how lame the gameplay was ALL THE WAY through the game. if you want to try a cheap game like this one that is good, get conan for a few bucks."
2,Pretty and very BORING!,"WOW! I was hoping this game wouldn't be as bad as people said. It really sucks! No fun at all. Pretty to look at on my 1080p-but that's it. Fun-factor = 3/10 Glad I only paid 37.00 for it. In a nutshell, if you're under 15 yrs old, you will love this game! If not, spit on it. What a waste."
4,not great but lots of fun,"Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End is a great looking game, visually stunning. That is its strongest feature, and there is a lot of wasted potential but that aside the game is still fun if you are a fan of the movies and like the beat the crap out of things with a sword."
2,Don't like it,Wasn't what I expected . I really don't like it. It seems boring. So far I don't want to play it
4,A great social history,"Not difficult to read, provides a look at many aspects of life in the Colonies and Iberia. Useful (especially for those who don't speak Spanish) references and maps in the back. I didn't give it five stars, however, because I think it was a bit choppy in the writing, jumping from place to place. I also think--even though I could be totally off the wall on this one--that the authors tried too hard to hide their bias for one of the women. I'm not much of a social historian, I'm much more of a structuralist, so I do recognize my own bias while reading this."
1,why do you pay someone to write your reviews?,"I tried this cream and now have to go to a dermatologist because of a skin reaction. The only positive feedback comes from a feedback pro. Don't believe me.......read the other ""reviews"" they have left. Buyer beware....any company that has to pay someone to write their reviews needs to put out a better product so real reviews can be written."
2,no good instructions,"this book expects you to be an expert at drawing, painting, photoshop.It gives some advice but is really only good for inspiration for someone experiencedI was actually trying to learn how to paint(had some basics down), and this was no use for me.The artist did most of the work in photoshop, and didn't really do a good job explaining how to get the results.Now that I have faster internet, I youtube whenever I want to learn something new. (Painting, Guitar, Fixing anything)"
4,Drawing and Painting Fantasy Beast,This is an very good book if you need reference material to draw upon. I would not recommend it for a beginner. Someone who has some drawing experience it is an excellent addition for his or her fantasy reference Libary.I found it interesting reading and gave very good tips on how to increase creativity but not the best how to draw book for the novice. The more advance artist will find it more helpful.
1,Mya should be tarred and feathered...and dropped in boiling acid.,"I haven't seen this DVD, but I have (unfortunately) bought many other Mya titles in the past. I won't ever do that again. Can you say ""rip off""? I have no idea where they get the rights to these movies...but I'm guessing it's from bottleggers around the world. Picture quality sucks on Mya DVDs. Subtitles appear and then become squiggly unreadable worms on the screen. The video flips and buckles just like an old VHS or Beta tape. Why? Because they are cheap and make no effort for quality...and they still charge too much for a piece of crap. That other reviewer must have been eating mushrooms...and you notice there was no mention of picture quality? Buyer beware!"
5,Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas....,"....without watching this episode of one of my favorite TV shows of all time, Northern Exposure. Christmas in Cicely, Alaska as experienced by the quirky, lovable characters of the town. This episode is filled to the brim with the spirit of the season, along with the not-so-spirit-filled attitudes that often go along with the season; in short - real-life! I've always been impressed with the way all the loose ends of the various plot lines are all resolved in the end - usually with only a musical score playing as we watch the characters go about the business of life. This episode is no different. I admit to getting choked up over Joel's gift to Maggie and Holland's gift to Shelly. Watch it and you'll see what I mean!"
5,Perfect for Church,I am a youth minister and I have used this CD in our youth service for praise and worship. The children love and the music is lively and fun so everyone wants to participate in the worship experience.
5,It's Gospel!,"If you don't actually like Gospel music you might not like it. It is not ""Christian Contemporary"", but there are songs that have been revamped to have more of a Gospel feel. My 3 year old loves it, she wasn't used to gospel since she only knows ""kiddie"" and Christian Contemporary. Now I am able to enjoy the Gospel that I love and she enjoys hearing other children singing praises."
4,Decent set of Billy Joel Albums,"Not a bad three-pack from the Piano Man, including the albums ""Piano Man"", ""52nd Street"", and the live album ""Kohuept"", as performed in the former USSR.""Piano Man"" and ""52nd Street"" are both essential Billy Joel classics, and contain such songs as ""Travelin' Prayer"", ""Piano Man"", ""Ballad of Billy the Kid"", ""Captain Jack"", ""Honesty"", ""Big Shot"", ""My Life"", and ""Stiletto"". The inclusion of ""Kohuept"" I think is somewhat debatable.... it's a live disc, so the music is not of the highest quality, although there's a lot of hits on the album. Kohuept is unique more for the concert itself and what it represented at the time (playing in the communist USSR) than for the actual music, and is interesting, but not as good for a collector's pack as say... ""Glass Houses"", ""The Stranger"", or ""An Innocent Man"".All told though, 3 solid albums, and worthy additions to any collection. The Piano Man is great, and this is a pretty economical way to pack in three of his classics."
3,A movie from my past,i was looking for a comedic sketch by Billy DeWolfe and the movie Blue Skies contained just what I was looking for.
5,Blue Skies...smilin' at me...,"-and I'm smilin' right back. Three cheers to ""Universal"" for doing this double feature justice. Both films look and sound wonderful, better than ever. Clearly done with care. ""Birth of the Blues"" is great fun, featuring excellent and exciting small group dixieland jazz playing. ""Blue Skies"" is a little hokey-but who cares? Great numbers with Bing and Fred.Not to crazy about leading lady Joan Caulfield though. I just wish they would have cast a girl with more charisma...like Rita Hayworth. Imagine, Fred and Rita dancing in technicolor...don't get me started. Of course, this film contains one of Fred Astaire's best routines-the amazing ""Puttin' On The Ritz"". Is there anyone on this earth who could rival Astaire's class, timing and smoothness factor in this number? No,there isn't!"
5,great movie,I loved this movie. It was entertaining and funny. If your a Bing Crosby fan you will want this one for your collection.
4,The Witch of blackbird Pond,"I recently got done reading ""The Witch of Blackbird Pond"". It was well worth my time. I would reccomend this book to anybody and everybody. I liked this book because it was very easy to understand even though the story took place a long time ago. The author ""Speare"" made this book enjoyable for all ages. I really liked this book because ""Speare"" made the book believeable and down to earth, it wasn't anything wild or outrageous. You could tell that ""Speare"" put a lot of time and effort into the book. I also liked the book because it was a real PAGE TURNER. Page after page the book left me thinking what's going to happen next. The book was just so un-predictable!""Elizabeth G. Speare"" did a really nice job on this book. Even if you are reading this book for the first time or the fith time I think you'll enjoy the book ""The Witch of Blackbird Pond""."
5,It's the most wonderful book I've read.,"I read ""The Witch of Blackbird Pond"" when I was fourteen. And now I'm the mother of two kids, I still read it again and again. It's the most wonderful book I've read. Read it, and you will like it."
4,Exciting,"I liked how this book portrayed life in the 1600s. I've always liked hisorical novels and this one doesn't dissapoint. owever I felt that not enough happened with the witch trial, there should have been more to it. However, I do recommend it."
1,"kinda good, but not the best book i've read",I was assassinged this book as a project in the 6th grade. I hardly liked it because it was alittle to old of print and of terms other so don't read this book if u like to be happy
4,"Hang in there, don't give up!","I am almost 30 years old. But I had to read this book when I was 10. I found the first half so boring I wanted to give up more than once. But my mother and teacher forced me to finish it and it ended up being one of the best books I've ever read. If you truly give this book a chance and appreciate that the first half sets up the second half you will not be disappointed. I still remember my heart jumping the first time I read about the ""witch""..."
2,Historical But Boring,"I thought that the Witch of Blackbird pond was a fairly boring story. Throughout the book there's not anything very exciting that the characters say or do. I also thought that the ending was too happy. Every character in the book was very happy at the end and i thought that it was too much. I think that if i were to give this book a grade it would be a C-. And also, if you're going to read this book, I don't recommend that you should read it if you are under the age of 10. If you like history, romance, and happy endings, then I very strongly recommend this book for you. Otherwise you will most likely find this book very boring."
2,Terribly elusive.,"""The Witch of Blackbird Pond"" is poorly advertised. If you're expecting a novel filled with accounts of the Salem Witch Trials, like I thought, you're wrong. It is not until almost 200 pages into the book will the subject be touched upon, and then gingerly dropped. Much of the writing is fillers and dribble; this book could have been 100 pages shorter. I didn't care for any of the characters, and all of them were typecast. The angry, strict Uncle, the caring, soft-spoken Aunt, two cousins - one being the flirt and one being sweet. And, of course, the outcast niece. I was very disappointed, as I had my sights set on a captivating Salem Witch Trial book. The title is very misleading. I do not recommend."
3,"A Sweet, Tidy Story","This is a nice, enjoyable story that will leave you smiling and a little bit more informed about history, as well.Author, Spear, does a good job of weaving historical information into her novel, without making it feel stuffy or unfamiliar. The characters are interesting and fun to read about and you find yourself looking forward to the next time you can pick up this book and enter their world again!It is slightly too predictible, but that didn't really make much of a difference to me, because I didn't read it for shock value.If you are looking for a lovely, tidy little book that will not offend anyone, I high recommend The Witch of Blackbird Pond."
2,OK,"This book was ok to me. It dragged on quite a bit but I really liked the ending. I didn't like how it would talk about the same thing for over 3 chapters. It just felt like it wasn't my kind of book. However, I liked the last part. The last 5 chapters were probably that only part I liked."
2,Literary Analysis of The Witch of Blackbird Pond,"In this mysterious, crazy,and exciting story, a young orphan girl befriends an old women and faces the consequences.The way the author uses literary devices to set the perfect mood makes this book so good you'll never want to put it down! Taking place in the 1600's tells alot about what it might of looked like.""I slowly gazedinto the coast, and to my suprise I saw hundreds of boats being docked.""This gives you a very good idea of what it looked like.""I've been for a breeze every morning, just thinking he might be coming up the river.""This is what Kit feals like when she is waiting for Nat to come.In this book the mood is very inportant. Literary devices are also very inportant."" The old women seamed to be very quiet , relinquish, and at ease."" This suspenceful , suprising, and exciting book sort of makes me start to think.""Maybe there are really witches?"
2,VERY mediocre,The book went very slowly and it didn't get interesting until the last few chapters (out of alot!)I would only recomend it if you like history.
2,Slow,A little bit slow at some points but other than that pretty good. I like the part where mercy is in love with John
5,Witch Of Blackbird Pond,This book is good. My mom said to give the book about 100 pages before seeing if it's good or not. I did and it turned out to be.. pretty good!
3,The Witch,"I read this about 10 years ago while still in school and enjoyed it, but this time it seemed dull and too judgmental."
5,I loved this book,The Witch of Blackbird Pond was a very good book. I loved how the characters made history come alive. This book seems like a complete fiction book because of the excitment and adventure the author puts in. I enjoyed reading this wonderful adventure story while at the same time I learned about the Salem With Trials and how the people thought back then. This book really is like a key to the minds of the people that lived in those times and why they weren't acceptant to people different than them.
3,Nice book,This book needs more romance and less politics. Its a good book for those who are into history and the politics of the colonies. A little bit hard to understand and visualize
3,I thought it was OK,"I liked it but I didn't care for the ending. I think Kit deserved all those fancy things William offered her, not snotty Judith!"
3,It was pretty good.,"This book was pretty good. Not the best, not the worst. Right about midway. Like someone else who read it, I did think it was awfully slow in the beginning and only liked the ending, when Kit was being tried for witchcraft."
5,Excellent Read for Both Adults and Children,"My daughter had to read this book for school and I read it also to help her with her book report. I was honestly surprised by how much I enjoyed reading this historical fiction. The main character of the book travels to the United States to live with a maternal aunt and her husband after her grandfather who raised her dies. She is accused of being a witch because she knows how to swim well and because she befriends an elderly woman who lives by Blackbird Pond. It is a story of romance, of forgiveness and of family bonding. I would suggest this book to both young and older readers alike."
5,I loved reading this book! This is a great book for fifth gr,This is an exelent book. I loved it! This would be a good book for fifth graders!
3,Very good,This is a good book. I give it 3 stars because it was very slow reading at the begining but then picked up.
3,Well written ultrahappy sunshine ending,"I read this book for an adolescent literature class at Humboldt State in California and I found the book to be well written and very entertaining. I was a little disappointed in the ending but maybe I'm just not one for the happy ending, too much perfection and it can get a little overwhelming. Definitely a good book for early readers with an exciting plot and great examples of fluid, colorful language that I would argue would captivate even the most advanced reader. Good book for everyone to brighten up their day."
5,Kit is doing slave work but still has time to fall in love.,"I really loved the book. One day I just grabbed it off my classes book shelf for a book report, thinking oh great another snoozer, but when I started to read I just couldn't put it down. I'm handing the book report in tomorrow and I'm not worried because since I loved it so much I found all the right words to say."
4,The Witch of Blackbird Pond,"Kit finds herself alone in the world, and so she makes a decision to surprise her Puritan aunt and uncle and hope that they will take her in. From the start Kit has trouble in her new home; the Puritan lifestyle is strick and not at all exciting, and Kit keeps making mistakes without knowing it. She finds a friend in an old woman who lives by the pond, and unknowingly brings herself and this woman into danger.This book is a great read for children; it's interesting, historically accurate, and not scary."
4,limited historical value,"Kid's classic, an enjoyable read about Puritan New England that isn't especially historically dense, but does bring the period to life"
5,BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY LIFE!,"I love this book so much I read passages from it every day. I thought that the author did a really good job with describing it and everything. I thought that she did such a good job, I felt as if I was in the story and I knew the characters. (Hey, I kinda felt as if I were Kit and I knew exactly how she felt about Nat Eaton.) Any way, This book is lovely and helps you understand the Salem Witch Trials and is just a great book to read if you don't have anything to do. It would be nice to see it made into a movie!"
4,Salem thoughts,The book that read is called the Witch of BlackBird Pond. I liked this book because of the interestind situations that Kit Tyler went through. This book shows a little about how people used to think and feel when we first started with the colonies. I geuss some of you that have moved great distances would know how she felt. I think that if you like history or are interested in the colonies and how they thought you would like this book.
3,Witch of Blackbird Pond Casts Spell Over Reader,"Having just finished reading The Witch of Blackbird Pond, I was pleased with the author's ability to make readers sympathetic to her main characters. The book is a real page turner in spite of being somewhat predictable. It was full of fascinating historical information on pre-Revolutionary America's political and religous climate. I really enjoyed it and am glad I read it."
3,Book Review Project,"I don't feel that the author did too good of a job on the plot which was supposed to be on witches and witchcraft. The theme of a ""witch"" of Blackbird Pond was really not presented until close to the end of the book. In the beginning of the story when Kit jumped into the river to fetch Prudence's doll, and she was floating, Goodwife Cruff and other ship passengers accused her of witchcraft. It was much later that the whole story about Hannah Tupper came together. Waiting to the middle of the book to really start getting into the witches seems to weaken the book. To me, it took the author too long to get to the point. I lost interest in the story."
4,the witch of blackbird pond-elizabeth george spheare- by andra prior,I read the witch of blackbird pond.I didnt like or dislike this book.It had fantastic chapters an awful chapters. The most awfu scenes in this book are where everyone gets judgemental. The overall message in this book wasshard to figure out but i thought it was: never let someone judge you for who you appear to be.I would recomend this book to people who like adventurous historical fiction books.
2,Boring,"After purchasing this for our home library, I couldn't wait to read it before my children did. I was bored and unenthused throughout the reading. The author made great attempts at historical accuracy, just not enough with character or plot development. The story must have been born of facts first, as the characters just seemed thrown about and inconsistent. Along with the lack of plot, those inconsistencies are what make this a brutal read. I can't imagine either of my young avid readers enjoying this book and all its predictabilities."
2,LONG and DULL,"witch of blackbird pond is a very well written book. it goes into much depth about certain things, however, i feel that is one of the reasons it is only a 2 star book. this book tells a story about a girl who moves into america before the revolutionary war. she has to saty with her only remaining relatives, who do not share the same points of veiw as she, kit tyler, does. kit is acused of being a witch but in the end can not be proven of her suspected withcraft. this book, yet well described, is streched out over to many pages. a lot of unesscesary things go on that one should not need to know. witch of blackbird pond has no real point to me and is a LONG and DULL book"
1,Very bad work by Elizabeth Speare review for Mr. Jones,"I think this book was boring. The only exciting part is the witch hunt. Most of the time they talked about polatics. If they wern't the were cring over petty grevences such as love. This is why this story was boring. The characters were annoying and obtuse, it was hard reading such a disgusting piece of lititure. Kit was such an unintelligent and snooty creature it was infurating to read about. The women were either self-centered or meek, the thought about love all the time. The men disscussed politics like a change would end the world and the men thought women were dirt. Nat and the cat were the only intellegent creatures. The characthers are just lacking perwsonality and intellegence."
1,The Witch that wasn't!,"I didn't like the book so much. The author put to much detail about one person, Kit. I knew all of the background information about Kit and everything she owned. But when Hanna Tupper was introduced I hardly knew anything about her. The author also didn't write in any excitement in the story. Everyone was just plain everyday individuals that did everyday things, like cleaning and spinning wool, making meals, cleaning the house and making clothes. It would have been interesting if the author had put Kit or some other character on an adventure or made it a fiction not a historical fiction. I don't know anyone who would like to read a book about just everyday, ordinary people, that are living ordinary lives. I want to read a book about some adventure or action."
3,Stirs up feelings and emotion,"In the novel _The Witch of Blackbird Pond_, Kit Tyler travels to solemn Wethersfield, Conneticut. Kit must learn to adjust to the back-breaking and hardworking chores as well as the hypocritical people in Conneticut such as Goodwife Cruff and her strict Uncle Matthew. The book is filled with suspense and emotion and lets you get to know the characters in positive and negative ways. Though the book creates supsense and makes you keep reading, it was very predictable and I could tell what would happen next in the story. In conclusion the book is excellent and gllues your eyes to the pages."
5,I reccomend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction,"This is one of my most favorite books. Kit Tyler is the main character. Her parents died, so she went to America to her aunts house. There, was a bad-tempered uncle, sensitive aunt, and two stuck up, but mostly kind girl cousins. This story takes place in Salem Massachusetts in a time when they prosecuted witches. I thought the book was compelling, realistic, and unpredictable. I reccomend this novel to anyone especially if you enjoy historical-fiction."
5,The Witch of Blackbird Pond (MM),This book was a great book. It tells the tale of a girl who doesn't fit in and therefore is accused of being a witch. This book is a good book for some one who likes to learn about history and adventure. This book is exciting and you won't want to put it down.
4,Worth Reading!,"Katherine Taylor (Kit) is a fancy girl from Barbados going to live with her aunt and uncle in New England. When her grandfather died, she had to leave her life from swimming in the ocean to cold winters in Conneticut.I loved reading this book but sadly if you wanted a book about the Salem Witch trails, you may be disapointed with ""The Witch of Blackbird Pond"". Witches and trails do play into the storyline, but only briefly. None the less, it's a great action/adventure/romance which you'll want to read again!"
5,Awesome Book!!~,This book started off pretty slow but it definately had enough excitement to keep me from putting the book down! I really liked the ending! It was one of those 'Awwwww moments'!!~ I bought this book for my step-daughter (7th grader) and decided to read it first. I finished it in 4 hours. I couldn't put it down and I'm not one who likes to read!~ A great book for a teenage girl (12-15).
4,An interesting look back in time,"It was a good story. I thought the title of the book was misleading and an odd choice compared to what the story was really about but I liked how the characters were easy to distinguish from each other and were memerable. A great ending. I learned something from it too, on how people were treated during the war when they were not from this country - which is sad. Though it wasn't one of my favorites, I'm glad I read it."
5,THE MOST UNBELIEVABLE BOOK EVER!!!!!!,This was the greatest book i've ever read and i think everyone in the world should read it and i think everyone should buy lots of copies for all their family and friends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,ugh...I'm probably over the age range but...,"I had to read this book for school (literery circles, and I made the mistake of picking this think) I'm in 8th grade, and I thought this book was rather stupid. The basic plot was fine, but the thing was like a soap opera, where everyone was with the wrong person, and of course, everyone was ever so happy at the end. I would have found this a more enjoyable book if the ending had been Kit marrying Willam, Judith becoming an old maid, and Nat marrying someone else. (Still John with Mercy though, because they deserve it.)The reason I gave this two stars is that readers 8-10 would probably enjoy this, but if you're a teenager or even an older preteen, I wouldn't recomend it."
4,This is one good book,"I've heard from alot of people how boring this book was. For me it was ok. I love the plot but the whole setting in the 1600s was what I didn't like, and one chapter was all dedicated to some political guy, I didn't like that either. So some parts are really boring other are ok and other are REALLY good, for example the last part, I love that part. I love that sorta thing."
2,"I had to read it for school , what could I say",It draged a bit and was a bit boring . I liked the history in it about the early colonies . But still not my type of genre
2,An interesting but predictible book,"This book was semi interesting. I liked certain parts, but compared to other books, this one was too predictible. I prefered the book, Beyond the Burning Time. Not only was it better, it was less predictable and more interesting! But read the two books for yourself and you can decide!"
2,It was so-so.,"I think this book was odd. It never really caught my interest, even though I read the whole book. I guess I just don't like these mushy historical fiction stories. I'm the kind of person who likes books that describe the tactics of the battles. I think this book resembled a soap opera."
1,Sleep indusing boredom,"I HATE this book! It is so boring! Basiclly, this girl is moving from some island to Conneticut in the 1600's, and the storyline basiclly follows all the random boring things she does day to day, even when there could be action, it is still boring. Only read this if you have trouble falling asleep. There is hardly any magic or anything like that at all, as said by the title."
1,Sigh,"This book is boring, but there are some ok parts. Don't read this book unless you have to. (...) Duh! Well, just don't read the book."
1,Horrible Book!,This is the most boring book I have ever read! Nothing really happens in the end. How could anyone like it?
1,bad book: A kid's review,"I had to read this for school, and it was hard for me to look at it. There is no action, no humor, no excitement whatsoever. There is a lot of detail, but that is only on one person. All that really happens is the girl, Kit meets a lonely old lady who is nice to her. She isn't even a witch. I say that this is the worst book in the world. I think that it's like eating pure cocoa. So bitter, bland and boring."
4,THE WITCH OF BLACKBIRD POND IS A GOOD BOOK!,"The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a good book.Friendship was clearly a theme of this good book, The Witch of Blackbird Pond. Kit, a thirteen year old girl, was friends with Hannah, although the people of Wethersfield said she's a witch. Kit goes to Hannah's house almost every day to keep her company. One day she went there with her friend Nat to help fix Hannah's roof, and when she got home, her uncle Matthew got mad at her. Another day Kit had to hide Hannah because the town thought she made the disease that was going around. Finally... Oh! I shouldn't tell you any more, you'll just have to find out by reading this good book. Enjoy!"
4,Review of The Witch of Blackbird Pond,The witch of black bird pond is a book about a girl is accused of being a witch. The main character is Kit Tyler. The story is about a girl who came from England and went to the Caribbean and went to New England to live with her cousins. The town that she lived in was a town in Connecticut in 1687.The people accused Kit of being a witch. She could not do anything about it and she was put in a store room. The son of the captain saved her from being persecuted as a witch. She got away from the people that accused her. This book is a good way to understand the way the people who were different were treated in New England in the 1600s.
2,Tiki's Total Review Page,I enjoyed this book mainly because it is a Historical fiction novel. I think this book would be a good reading source for anyone between the ages of 11-13 because it has alot to teach about life in the 1800's while letting you read a facinating story about a girl and the troubles she goes through after she moves away from her home in Barbados to her uncles home in New England. I think the auther needs some more detail in her writting as to create a more vivid picture of the senery. I think that it would be wonderful if this story could have a sequel to it because like all books it cuts of into ablivion.
1,"Call me crazy, but...","It's not that this is a poorly written or poorly concieved book. It's that I have a great deal of trouble believing that anyone like Kit existed in the 1600s. Certainly there were people who were frustrated with society, but...like this? WoBP reads like a bad Mary-Sue fanfic. The heroine is too perfect."
1,Brina's Review,"I read this book when I was in fifth or sixth grade. I'm sorry to say I hated it. I felt that the book was very dragged on. The story line was okay but I think the book could of been much shorter if it was not so dragged. All in all, I did not favor this book at all."
1,A Girl who lost everything takes her chances in Wethersfield,"This book was an overall 1 star book. The quality of the dialogue was horrible because it was very unrealistic. This book was also very boring and drawn out because it did not have a lot of action. The characters, however were very interesting and original. The events were very boring and predictable."
1,This book was nice.,"The Witch of Blackbird Pond, by Elizabeth George Speare, was filled with excitement. The only reason I gave this book 1 star was I always compare it to the French classic Gravybleu. I liked a lot though, more than my usual books; Hamington Road and the most recent Loolystolu. I loved this book because I sort of learned about America. I am glad I was able to share this to the world...because this was my only dream...to share my feelings to American kids!! Thankyou and read it! :)"
5,Moving and Profound,"This is a truly incredible book that I discovered in the classroom when I was about 10, maybe younger. The soap-making scene was excerpted in my history book as a lesson about how the Puritans lived in the 1600s.The detail of life during those harsh times is simply fascinating. Everything from household chores to religious beliefs to politics is covered, but the real beauty of this gem of a book lies in the subtle romance between the title character and a sea captain's son, and in the love that she comes to feel for Hannah, a suspected witch, Prudence, a young, neglected child, and her aunt's family who take her in as one of their own.This book is as pleasurable to read today as it was over 10 years ago. A true classic. For lovers of friendship, romance, loyalty and history, I highly recommend it."
3,"Oh, this book was wonderful! I really enjoyed it!","In the book the Witch of Blackbird Pond, a girl named Kit runs from her home in Barados to come to her aunt and uncle's home in Wethersfield after her grandfather died. She finds out that Wethersfeild is a very different place than Barbados. Who would think that knowing how to swim, read, and just being friends with an elderly woman can get her in trouble? She also faces new decisions in this book such as if she should marry the handsome William Ashby who she doesn't really care about or face the court who accuses her of witchcraft? This book was really worth reading."
3,White Collar Girl from Barbados Moves to Puritan N. America,"This historical fiction novel describes the move of a white collar girl, Kit Tyler, from Barbados to Puritan North America, due to the death of her grandfather. The book is well written and the plot is interesting, but it is often slow and annoying. I gave this book 3 stars only because it got the Newbery Prize."
4,A supenseful story of true love and denial.,"The _Witch of Blackbird Pond_ is a story about a girl by the name of Kit who comes to Wetherfield, Connecticut and has to adjust to her new life. This book is exciting and full of emotion. It is well written and should be read by others."
4,Witchcraft + Love= A Great Book!,"The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a book about how a 16-year-old girl,Kit, is trying to survive in a new town with people unlike herself. As someone who has never done work in her life, it is hard for Kit to be accepted in a hardworking town. From the first day she came to Wethersfield she was suspected to be a witch as well as her new friend Hannah Tupper. At the same time love is in the air and is causing a problem at the Wood's house. The love plot might be too predictable, but it still very enjoyable to read."
5,A unique and intrigueing thriller!,"This excellent novel will definitely keep you reading on. There are well thought out cliff hangers at the end of each chapter. A bit of foreshadowing adds to the suspense and mystery. All of the characters that protain to this mystifying classic are well thought out, and well developed. With the help of it's convinvcing atmostphere, this story definately depics the Puritan ways, and gives the reader a unique picture of witch trials. Not only does this novel have a special edge, but it teaches the reader a lesson as well. The lesson that is told in the Witch of Blackbird Pond not only protains to the Colonial times, but could definitely apply to the modern age."
5,"A romantic, historical fiction novel about justice, love, courage, and friendship","Kit Tyler has lived her whole life in the beautiful, Caribbean country of Barbados. Her first glimpse at her new home in Connecticut tells her that her life in colonial America will be nothing like the beautiful and elegant world she has always known. She doesn't understand the stern and somber people here--especially not the mischievous sailor, Nat Eaton, who always turns up when she least expects it. In her loneliness, she develops a dangerous friendship with an outcast widow many of the townspeople think might be a witch. But how much will that friendship cost her?The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a wonderful story about coping with change and learning to be true to ourselves. Through the gentle affection of the Widow Tupper, Kit learns to find her vocation in life--and in love."
3,Footnote in Atlanta music history,"The defunct Atlanta act had been a crucial live fixture in the late 80s even before touring with the Indigo Girls and signing to their Daemon label. Sadly, they met the same national resistance that Kristen Hall faced, from radio stations who felt one act of denim-wearing guitar-playing Atlanta women was enough. This is despite the Society's very different, and aggressive guitar sound. Chris McGuire and Cooper Seay are awesome guitarists, and ""Squinting at the Sun"" is probably the best track. Little more than a local footnote now, it's a shame they didn't make it farther."
1,I Never got it,I never got this order even after i contacted the seller and attempted to resolve a problem i received a refund so i just doped the issue
4,Very please,"I just received my stroller, and I love it. Looks just like the picture, but better! Very easy to put together, very light to push! So far my dog liked it! I have a boston terrier and a boxer, obviously the terrier will be the one using it! THe only downfall I see so far is the buttons, they snap to the bottom, and it's a little difficult to do, but is do-able! All in all, this is a great product!"
4,Pet Stroller,This product is great. I bought it for my cat so that he would be able to go outside and he love it. I am able to carry a lot of my items in the basket under where he sits. I love it
1,Very good quality,"I was pleased with the quality of the pet stroller. It even has places for your water bottle, cell phone, purchases (bottom tray). Rec'd in perfect condition, and delivery time was quick."
1,Bulldog Ractical Leg Holster,"I purchased this holster at Cabelas and am very disappointed. Among the many things wrong with this holster is that, despite being advertised for a standard frame auto, it does not hold my Colt Model 80. If fact, the weapon moves around in the holster quite freely. Secondly, the leg straps are too short and I have average size thighs. Lastly, the holster flops out from my leg approximately one inch and there is no way to hold the holster tight against your thigh. All in all, a pooly made holster from a poor design. It is almost redundant to say that it was made in China. Do not purchase this product."
3,NOT FOR GRAD SCHOOL APPS,"I cannot comment on the utility of this book for applying to undergraduate schools. It may be fabulous. The author does use humor and lots of examples to help. However, I was applying to graduate school, and the essay style is completely different (at least it was for all of my applications).The graduate essay requires a wealth of specific information to be included. Specific, biographical information including past jobs and relevant experiences. This book discourages such broad essays - the very ones required by most graduate programs (at least in psychology). For grad school applicants, I recommend ""How to Write a Winning Personal Statement for Graduate and Professional School"" by Richard Stelzer. Not only is it thought-provoking and well written, it includes sections for specific programs (medical, law, business, etc.)"
3,college essays,This was purchased for a grandchild so I barely skimmed it before giving it to him. What I did read seemed to make sense and should be helpful to him.
5,Really Helpful Book,The book is short and very well written. It gives you the straight answers to a lot of admissions questions with a large focus on the essay part of the application. I'm convinced that the essay was one of the things that helped me get into Middlebury College. I'd encourage you to buy this book if you are going to be applying to college.
5,"harry bauld, great writer and teacher","harry is my english teacher and helped me complete my college essay. We are all given his book and it helped a great deal, along with reading it and his help my essay was fabulous and i was also accepted early decision to oberlin. this is a great book, the one you should buy if you are only buying one, it is written exactly as he teaches and ""sounds"" just like him and i strongly recommend it to all high school students. Its not just dry and boring he makes sure to add humor all through the book"
4,Highly informative book,"This book is great to aid people when they apply to major colleges. The author include tips and things that he notices, when he was/is an admissions councelor, to help people be accepted into college. The book also teaches the reader on ways the reader could prepare themselves for letters of recommendations, interviews, *essay writting*, and obvious course that students may take in high school that will appear on their transcript. Will definately aid people with college applications."
3,Sickening true stories of depravity,"This book is hard to read. It is hard to wade through the cruelty.There are stories here of families being split apart by an uncaring master class. Children were callously sold and permanently separated from their parents. Husbands and wives were similarly split up.Frankly, it makes you sick.Then there are the stories of brutality. Again it makes you sick. How could the slave owners have sunk so low?If you are looking for well written stories that bring the institution of slavery to life for you, this is not the book. What you get here are very short and very simple reports by individuals. There's nothing here that you didn't know already. This is not a great work of literature.This is just a punch right in the nose to make you wonder how slave owners could have been so cruel."
5,Happy Customer,"I am 5'10"" and purchased the long in both white and black. The reviews are accurate in saying that the long is truly a long, but I love this purchase. The material quality is high and the style is very nice. The adjustable straps allowed me to pull it up, and while the straps do slip a bit, I could easily pin them in place and adjust according to the length of whatever I have on. I am very happy with this purchase."
4,VANITY FAIR SLIP,"I ordered this slip online because it is getting more & more difficult to find larger size lingerie items in department stores--especially full length slips. I like the design and material. It does seem to run a little small, but that's OK becuse I want to lose weight!"
3,Shorter Than Expected,Probably my fault but this was way shorter than I expected. I kept it because I'm sure I can use it in the future but I need to order a longer one.
4,Good quality item,The slip fit perfectly. The adjustable straps allowed me to play with the positioning under my dress and the length was on target.
3,Sewing glitch- check item immediately,"Overall, a nice slip except for one of the straps. The adjustable loop wasn't connected and I had to tie it. I used the slip way after I bought it so I don't think I can exchange it."
2,"does job, but requires constant adjustment","This could be a really great item. The length is perfect if you are a knee length skirt/dress wearer. The material is not bulky and stays static free. The fit is comfortable enough that I don't notice I'm wearing it under a dress. I gave it two stars though because of one detail that I find excessively annoying: the adjustable straps don't stay put. I have to adjust them every time I wash it (where they also become very twisted), every time I put it on or take it off. The straps slip throughout the day as I wear it... you get the idea. The annoyance this poses to me outweighs the other good features that it has. I will ditch it after this winter, unfortunately. If readjusting does not bother you, than there is nothing else wrong with this item."
4,okay slip,"This slip is not gorgeous or luxurious, it is just okay. I wear them as nightgowns or around the house in the summer. One of the straps consistently twists around the hook which is annoying and keeps me from wearing it as often as I would otherwise. At least it was inexpensive but you get what you pay for, especially in this case."
1,Didn't Work,"When I received this in the mail it didn't work. Upon further inspection, it looks like FansEdge sent me an already defective product because the product had batteries in it already, which it was not supposed to come with. I called them and they were supposed to send me a return label to send the product back and a refund. I am still waiting 3 weeks later for both of these and now have to work with my credit card company to contest payment. I would not order anything from FansEdge again."
4,Entertaining,"Cd was full of praise to the LORD and very upbeat. Played it everywhere,even @ work.Even made a few copies for my co-workers & boss.Made me really proud to own this little gem."
5,successful book,"My criticism would be that people with emotional problems with God's grace can still be good spouses. On the other hand, it certainly helps make the marriage easier and with a higher probability of success to marry someone who is emotionally well-adjusted!A great book to help young adults to look at themselves and their relationships so they will have healthy marriages and families."
5,Merengue Callejero with a lot more to say.,"This is a great album. Its definitely Merengue Callejero, but with a lot more lyrics and suprises than the usual. There is a lot more thinking and production going on here than in most Merengue. And dont get me wrong I like most Merengue, but Los Potros really have something refreshing going on here. Although Oye Mi Ritmo is the first single and is slamming, the other songs will grow on you tremendously. Vengan Todas Mujeres Latinas is the jam. Rebeca99 and Esa Morena will grow on you if they dont catch you on first listen. I like this album more everytime I listen to it."
5,Great car for the price The kids (and myself) love it.,For the price this little car has a lot of features head and tailights and the ability to run another at the same time without interference due to the different frequencies available. These cars have been crashed into walls and each other over and over and seem to be ok. The only one that broke took a flight off of a desk and the steering linkage snapped on one wheel when it impacted the floor. Cant really complain about that. I bought extras for the price. What really matters is that it entertains the young ones and is helping them learn the controls before moving to more expensive models.
1,Waste of $15,"I disassembled this thing for pieces, and the construction couldn't be cheaper. The steering is achieved with an electric motor, not a servo, so it's ""all or nothing""; not very much fun. I recommend either get something much more expensive, or something much less expensive."
5,review,acting leaves something to be desired but the directing is magnificient and the plot it amazing. an excellent buy
4,Zoot Suit - Great!,"Zoot Suit is a movie I recommend to all (especially Latinos) who are interested in a small portion of neighborhood life in LA during World War II. The musical score is excellent and has a tendency to urge you to increase the volume. The acting is very believable, while the alter ego character (James Olmos) constantly challenges your mind to determine who he is and what he represents - until the end. All in all, very enjoyable."
5,GOOD MOVIE...!,"Very good movie. Well done, directed, written, acted. The story is amazing, it really is. And the music and the way that is made...WOW...!"
4,Great Disney Music,"If you're a fan of Disney music, you can't go wrong with this CD. I especially enjoy ""Fantasmic"". For those who have never been to a Disney Park, this music is from a terrific ""must see"" show, staring Mickey and his imagination. I also love ""The Siamese Cat Song"" from ""Lady & The Tramp"". Songs from favorites like Jiminey Cricket, Winie The Pooh, to newer the movies ""Hercules"" & ""Pocahontas"". The only song I wasn't fond of was ""Femininity"". This is volume 4 in a collection of 5, all of which are very good. These songs will have you humming through your day!"
3,Disney 4,"These are the obscure songs from Disney history - I've been a Disney music fan forever, and I didn't know maybe half of them. The disc is good for having the classic Disney mix of old and new, and it has a few gems that I haven't heard since I was young."
3,Makes the hair on your neck stand up!,"Well worth a listen, similar in atmosphere to the Tindersticks, but even less jolly. Would appear to have the potential of classic on it!"
3,perhaps a little too moody,"I bought this CD because I had heard the Johnny Cash version of I See a Darkness and wanted to hear the person who wrote that haunting song. This CD is the first I have heard of BPB. I like some of the songs, but overall, it is SO slow and so melancholy that it becomes too much. Makes Candy Says by the Velv. Underground sound positively upbeat. And this is coming from someone who loves slow, minor-key music. Also, Billy has a way of harmonizing with himself which makes it seem like he is singing out of tune. Kind of unnerving."
3,"Moody yes, but lacking in dynamics","This is the first CD I've heard of his, and I purchased it on the strength of reviews and word of mouth. It is moody yes, but there really arn't any dynamics within the songs. They are all slow, minimalist, with very little happening. The melodies are usually directionless, and songs often lack recognisable structure. Thus each song has a mood (generally dark) and really if you've heard part of a song, you've heard the whole of it musically. I don't mean this to be a fully damning review however. It works at what it attempts to do, and is not a bad album by any stretch. Listening to it, I just felt that it could be much more powerful and atmosphic if there were some variation in tempo and intensity."
2,"urethane coating, how about all urethane",It is my girls first year in ballet so I just wanted an inexpensive bag. If you want a really nice bag don't waste your money here. The entire bag is made of urethane and has a cheap feel. The biggest positives are the cute graphics and the straps work well.
4,Great Buy,"I read the whole play in one day. It isn't quite as good as the musical, but anyone who likes the music will enjoy the play as well."
1,formatting and grammar...where is it?,"I have to admit that I have real problems with books that lack editing. This is a case in point. This book is difficult to read because of all the grammatical and spelling errors. Misplaced modifiers abound, too. Perhaps these errors have been corrected in subsequent printing, but at least, the one that I read had multiple errors on nearly every page. By the way, what is with spaces between paragraphs?Living on the North Coast as I do, I understand that people living in Ohio might find the story intriguing because of the subject matter; however, I found it difficult to enjoy the story because of the stilted conversations and implausible situations."
4,Rainbow's End,"I highly recommend the book Rainbow's End by author Bob Adamov. From Civil War intrigue to Lake Erie island suspense, it is action/adventure packed with a touch of romance. Great reading from start to finish."
5,Bruce Rocks,"I have not heard the first two albums in years. Early Bruce is so different than his current music. Hearing ""Rosalita"" reminded me of all the concerts I went to. Greetings' ""Hard to be a Saint in the City"" is one my favorite songs ever: urban and edgy. Darkness has always been my favorite Bruce album. It still is."
3,E street boys,It was great to get Bruce and the boys together in one package.I only had the old buggered vinyl.these were the days when I lived Darkness and was immortal .Stan
1,Trying to get in touch with dealer and no success and not the only one,"When I received the Caravaggio book I knew immediately that I was not satisfied. The condition was listed as ""good"" but the binding was ripped. I contacted Amazon immediately and was told to contact the dealer. I was given a number to call but did not reach a person, I left a written request for information about returning this book. I have not heard from them and it has been over a week. I also read a review from a different unsatisfied customer. It was BHFO books and I actually would like some help from Amazon in contacting this dealer and getting my money back."
5,One of the best live albums ever,This is quite simply one of the very best live albums ever. Plain and simple!
5,Surprisingly good,"I do love that this sells as a 12 pack so I don't have to run out and get more every time I need to change the air filter but what I like even more is that these are excellent, and to my admittedly unprofessional eye, seem to last as long as the special (and expensive) 3M long lasting air filters, even though these are designed to be more frequently changed. From now on, I'll be buying these filters, and hope to continue to buy a 12 pack every 18-24 months, since these don't seem to need to be changed monthly."
4,Polyester Air Filters,the multi pack is a good way to have a fresh fillter whenit needs to be changed.
2,Noel even admitted its rubbish,"Oasis dogged it on this album.... Be Here Now and Dya Know What I Mean are the only 2 songs on here that don't drive you mad. It's still a fun album to own for like a month, but after that it will collect dust. I don't know what it is about Oasis, but their songs just tire very easily, unlike the songs of say, U2. Anyway I'm sure the next album will be great again. Yeah Yeah Yeah."
1,WHAT A SHAME!,"They are sold out but made a loooooong album..... Has anybody listened to the full CD without pulling the ""stop""buttom of your CD player???"
1,this album suxxxx,i could hardly stand to listen to this cd for more than five minutes.......it was so depressing and all the songs practically sounded the same.....get What's the story morning glory....it rocks
2,Not all that,"I am a Oasis fan and to be honest Be Here Now isn't very good . The only good songs are d'you know what i mean , magic pie , stand by me and all around the world {which is too long } . Its no where near as good as the others and isn't worth the money"
1,Bombastic over-indulgent arrogant rock star cliches,"There have been many comparisons of Oasis to the Beatles, often by the band itself; but Noel Gallagher cannot draw the distinction between inspiration and imitation. On their first two albums, they got away with mere imitation just because they came up with some pretty infectious melodies. But on this album, the melodies aren't even there. They've fallen victim to their own hype and have created a monster. For God's sake, do not buy this album. ""All Around the World"" is the best song, although like the rest of the album, someone should have turned off the studio tape halfway through the band's performance. Way too long and tedious. And if Noel is one of the richest musicians in England, can't he afford some cleaner production?"
3,Longer songs and bad production,"While this album tends to get mixed reviews, I do like it. It is not their best by far, but it does include some great songs like D'You Know What I Mean? and Stand By Me. I have to say, though, the songs go on for way too long and the production is horrible. Even Noel hates the production on this one. Most of the songs are 5 minutes and counting and they could easily be trimmed by a minute or two. The production is a mess. The album sounds like it was mixed underwater: everything is a jumbled mess. Anyway, it is not a horrible album and I love listening to it now and again."
5,By the Way...,"My review referred to the vinyl version of Be Here Now... -with the perfect large cover-art... -yes, it all makes sense now/then... -listen on headphones... Tape it!..."
5,"""the BEST OASIS album of all times""","I don't konw why everybody critic this GREAT album, I think it's Oasis best, we got excellent guitars, a very inspired Liam that can touch the roof with his voice and the other 3. There are also a lot of classics like ""d'you know what I mean?"" personally the best Oasis Chorus ever, we got ""stand by me "", ""the girl in the dirty shirt"" wich is the best song of the entire album, ""don't go away"" and a great song that define the hole spirit of the album: All around the world. A piece of advise: don't listen to the critics, first listen to it and you'll see."
2,Very disappointing,"When Oasis is good, they have catchy lyrics and well thought out arrangements.But when they're bad,they sound annoyingly loud and rushed.This cd shares a bit of each.With good tracks like D'You Know What I Mean,All Around the World, and Don't Go Away, you wonder how they made the crappy My Big Mouth,I Hope I Think I Know,etc.If you liked Whats the Story (Morning Glory)chances are you will not like this album."
4,Maybe not Oasis' best but still way good,"I don't see why critics and even other Oasis fans keep downing this album. And I certainly don't see why it was thought such a failure . . .""Some bands will never sell that many records in their whole career"" . . . With the exception of Magic Pie (it just rubs me the wrong way) I like every song on this album. Be Here Now is one of my favorite Oasis songs it's just plain head bobbin', foot tappin' fun. Don't go away is by far the best track on this album. And I love Girl In the Dirty Shirt. Oasis rocks and I'd like to talk to anyone who feels the same so e-mail me at yub_yub@excite.com"
2,Hasn't anyone noticed yet?,"Yeah, Oasis defined a period with Wonderwall, and yeah they had a few good tunes on the first two albums. But haven't you all noticed you can play Wonderwall and Live Forever directly over all of these tracks? I give'em 2 for being consistent."
5,Excellent.,"This is a fantastic album. I bought it after Definately Maybe and What's the Story (Morning Glory). It's longer, rougher, and heavier. It's just filled with great songs. The album as a whole may have some weak points, but songs like D'You Know What I Mean?, Magic Pie, Stand By Me, Fade In-Out, and of course, Don't Go Away, really make this a must-own. The album is a lot of a certain Oasis style that is unlike What's the Story, so I can see how this might be hit or miss for some people (especially if you want short songs, because the avgerage length here is 6 minutes), but I love it. Great stuff, highly recomended."
3,Too much of a good thing...,"Be Here Now starts off well enough...D'You Know What I Mean? at the time was quite different from anything else the band did. In fact, after hearing that song on the radio I was sure that the album would blow my mind...but it didn't. It's filled with songs like ""Stand By Me"", ""Magic Pie"", and ""All Around The World"" which are all wonderfully produced brilliant pop songs, but they all go on for over six minutes (the latter tops out at over nine minutes!) making the listner grow bored of the song and want it to all go away. I can't help but think the album would have sold much better had each of the songs ended at four minutes. Still, the mealodies and music make this cd worth giving a listen to. You may have more tolerance than I do."
2,"not terrible, but really not good enough","this is a poor attempt at a follow up to morning glory. I wouldn't say its terrible, but I wouldn't buy it again if given the choice, which is a shame really, because their first two were quite good"
2,A Disappointing Follow-Up,"Oasis achieved phenomenal success with the release of their 1995 album ""(What's the Story) Morning Glory,"" but then followed the unfortunate trend of having their next album suffer. Still, ""Be Here Now"" has its moments. The best song on here is obviously ""All Around the World"". It's long, pretentious, and has a stunning music video to go along with it; it's reminiscent of the Guns N' Roses' song ""November Rain"". The album also houses ""The Girl in the Dirty Shirt,"" which is the nasaliest of any song Liam's sung before or since. The rest of the album is mostly just OK, making this a major disappointment given the brilliance of their last album. Oasis completists will want this album; everybody else would be wise to just buy ""All Around the World"" as a single and leave it at that."
5,4.85 STARS: A Classic Hard Rocking Album --Very Underrated,"I don't understand Noel's disdain for this record. Hell, it might be my FAVOURITE Oasis album of all (7) !! I bought the album on August 26, 1997 and it has been close at hand ever since. This is a pure, powerfully agressive masterpiece that I bet will get recieved better as the yrs go by. This record is about as subtle as a nuclear bomb. Raw aggression, yet still very listenable. Unlike the ""hard rock"" that is played on the radio these days, there is some quality to it. Sure, it's a bit overdone, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. To me, music serves as escapism, a mood changer of sorts and BHN completes that mission with flying colors. If you haven't listened to BHN in some time, try it again. If you have never heard BHN give it a try. THIS IS OASIS in it's purist, rawest form !!! BTW, I got to see them live on the BHN tour !!!!"
3,When Bad things happen to Good Mancunians,"This album is proof that Oasis was bound to stumble at some point. Hubris and talent can only carry a band so far. What could've been was reduced to what should've never happened! Despite the bad press that has been heeped upon this album over the years, it is still possible to dig through the sonic muck and find a few bright points."
4,"A very good album, but songs don't stick like other albums.","When I first listened to this album, I thought it was the best Oasis album there was, but as I kept listening, I figured out that this album was missing something. It didn't contain songs that stuck in my head that I wanted to keep listening to like (WTS)MG? and Definitely Maybe did have. It was dissapointing to see this album fade so quickly in the charts, but for their next album, hopefully their new producer will give them more of a new sound. All in all, it was a good album, but not great. Oasis could so much better, I think they got a little lazy and sloppy on this one. Hopefully, the new album will sound better and newer, and hopefully it will fare better in the charts."
3,last good one...,"this is the last good album by oasis...DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, MY BIG MOUTH and ALL AROUND THE WORLD are good tracks, but most of the album are not inspired like the first 2 oasis album...After be here now i totally lost my interest in oasis...Their live shows most be the worst shows ever...Some good rock songs, but the completelly static posture os liam and the TOTAL boring posture of the band...Man, try BLUR or BUSH...It's from england too, from the same time but is WAY WAY BETTER..."
4,Oasis,"oasis is a very talented British rock band reminds me of the early days of the British invasion of the sixties somewhat like a mix of the Beatles and the Rolling stones.Be here now by oasis,is a overall good album so if you,re into British rock? I recommend it and give it 4 stars."
4,[****] the critics!,"[****] the critics! This is a good rock 'n roll album. I hate it when people compare this to their first two albums.This is the first Oasis album I brought. I didn't like it when I first listen to it, but the songs stay with you.This album has replay value even years after I brought it. After listening to the songs, read the lyrics and you see what I mean."
2,Wake Me Up Please...,"I want to start out by stating the fact, I love Oasis. Be Here Now is a major disappointment from this sometimes brilliant band.Hype is what drove this band into the spotlight. When you have everbodys attention, you HAVE to perform well.What's The Story Morning Glory was released and it seemed anyone with a good trained ear for pure pop music was licking their chops.Then this yawn of an album was released and it seemed to take a lot of the air out of Oasis' balloon. Believe me, it's not a BAD album, it's just .....boring. Nothing jumps out at you making you want more. A lot of these songs sound like leftovers from other albums.I think that if this album actually kicked some butt, and had the catchy tunes like the ones on ""Morning Glory"" , Oasis would be #1.(not touring and sharing a bill with the Black Crows). I love you guys, you pump out some great tunes, but this is rubbish simply put."
2,"WORN OUT, WASHED UP HAS-BEENS","I don't have to hear only new music all the time, but I must say that Oasis' ""Be Here Now"" is one album I'd just as soon forget forever. If ""What's the Story Morning Glory"" defined and popularized Brit-pop, ""Be Here Now"" sounded its death knell! I will admit that the sound is much like older Oasis recordings, but that's just the problem. It's TOO much like the older stuff and sounds suspiciously like the Gallaghers were in a hurry to turn out something - anything - a.s.a.p. What makes this album so bad is that it was hyped SO much, which left this Oasis fan with a sharp sense of being taken for a ride. Oasis may be the most popular British band, but they aren't the best. Much British talent goes unnoticed overseas (i.e. Silver Sun, the Dandys, Shed Seven, Catatonia, Northern Uproar), and that's a shame! Save your money for something more original than ""Be Here Now."""
4,Be Here Now,"Be Here Now being Oasis 3rd studio album and their 1997 release was highly anticipated both critics and fans alike. The result is a good album but it is not as good as the prior album (What's the Story) Morning Glory?. The songs are very long and sometimes the sound is a bit bloated. The album did amazing and topped the charts in countries such as France, Austria, Sweden and the UK. Songs that standout on this release are ""D'You Know What I Mean?"" , ""Stand by Me"", and ""All Around the World"". 4/5."
2,Another example of cocaine-fuelled excess,"""Be Here Now"" does have its moments (""D'You Know What I Mean"", ""My Big Mouth"", ""Stand By Me"", and ""Don't Go Away"") along with a few lesser tracks (""All Around The World"" and ""It's Getting Better Man"") and a true dog (""Magic Pie""), but it's just another example of what happens when you're worth $40,000,000, the cocaine supply is never-ending (Noel Gallagher has admitted this and stopped using), and you ask how long a CD is (74 minutes) and you say, ""Well, let's fill the <expletive> up"".The production is awful. Knobs-up, full stop. Layers and layers of squalling guitars. All hints of subtleness are gone except for the end part of ""Don't Go Away"". The band still rocks out, but the sound is harsh.I almost gave it three stars because of the decent songs on here, but I've got to deduct one star for the ""Phil Spector with hearing damage"" style of production. Sorry guys. Find a better producer next time out."
5,"Oasis Rules, Dont Go Away",every song on it kicks but the song Magic Pie was not all that good. I still like the song. Oasis rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"A great mistake, but a great album","This album was a great deception. The songs are too long, and some of them could be easily cut of the album (My Big Mouth, I Hope I Think I Know, Fade In/Out). Others could be reduced to 4 minutes, and then they would be classics (Stand By Me, All Around The World, It's Getting Better Man). And at least one b-side should be on the album, ""Stay Young"", from the first single, ""D'You Know What I Mean?"". But looking back over 10 years, this is a great album, even with so many problems and overproduction. It's strange that the singles work so much better than the album, and it's because some songs are really very good. If the album was about 20 minutes shorter, it would be one of the best albuns in the nineties. Anyway, it was a great mistake, but it is a great album, and definitely worth listening."
5,It doesn't matter if your hopes and dreams are shattered!,"To the tipical Oasis fan, and hell, Oasis themselves, this album was a mess. I think that Oasis did reach a breaking point when they created this album, admitting they were plastered, and strung out on drugs. But this is Oasis at their peak: the vocals and guitar are as huge sounding as ever, the songwriting is as good, if not more endearing, than their first two records. Most people think that Oasis lost their touch after (What's the Story) Morning Glory, but if you really ignore the hype surrounding the band and focus on the music, Oasis have created a magnanimous, influential, and all around ballsy rock and roll album. D'you know what I mean?"
5,"Definitley ""not maybe"" the best Oasis album.","""...But I just think theres some good sounds on it and it was just a bit scatty and a bit mentally produced but thats who we are man, but I'd say that one (favourite album), so go f#%ken buy cause theres loads left"" Liam Gallaghar July 2000.And it is a great album, Definitley Maybe and Whats the story had the ""wonderwalls"" and ""Supersonics"" but nothing like this swirl and giant noise of guitar rock.Its a mega mega album and a triumphant album, and definitley not a dissapointment."
5,Mediocre? I don't think so.,"This, to put it bluntly, is an amazing album. Sure, it's not their best, but hey, who cares? To me, Definately Maybe deserved 5.5 stars out of 5. Morning glory deserved 6 stars out of 5, and if I could give a greater rating than 5 on this album, I would. I know it is a bit repititous by the time you get to the last couple of songs, but when the first few songs are as good as this, who cares if they go back on themselves? As long as Oasis are recording quality albums like this one, I'll always be a fan."
2,Boring...,"The songs in this album are quite boring, only a few good ones. I wouldn't recommend it, get their previous albums instead..."
2,Be - Ware Now,"what's wrong with ""Be Here Now""?in short, it's too longnearly every song is two, three, four minutes longer than it needs to bealso many people may have difficulty relating to the theme of egomania that runs through many of the songsor perhaps it's just that the album lacks balancenot enough variation from the grandios, lumbering anthems that make up the majority of the materialthere is nothing as bouncy as ""She's Electric"", as fast and cheerful as ""Up In The Sky"",or fast and angry ""Bring it On Down""not enough pace to counterpoint the ""Supersonic"" - style balladry"
3,It gets old fast,"First of all OASIS is not the greatest band in the world as they think, but one the most OVERRATED bands in the world.Having said that, Be here now is not a bad record but it suffers from overexposure : all of the good tracks got too much rotation everywhere (I'm in Peru...so go figure).The best tracks are the obvious, there not any hidden gems in here : ""Stand by me"", ""All around the world"", ""Don't go away"" and ""D'you know what I mean"". They're all instantly likeable, sound more or less the same and they get old fast."
2,Meatloaf for the 90s,"This album is a bloated, boring mess. The songs are overlong and overloud--they remind me more of Meatloaf than anything else. I can't believe this is the same band that created the brilliant ""(What's the Story) Morning Glory""....Avoid this ridiculous album at all costs."
1,Dissapointing,"When I heard the Morning Glory I was expecting a great third album but....No!. This album shows no evolution in the music of Oasis and is like they want to sound the same in every song. The tracks are boring, the voice of Liam really makes you sleep, the guitar tones never change except in the acoustic tracks. The bass and the drums play a small role in this record. I hope Oasis think about it, and don't think about a ""Definetly Maybe Part 4"" for their next record."
3,"It Rocks, Its sounds awesome at times, but overall its......","......very dissapointing.Problems?Some of the lyrics are'nt very good at all I'm afraid and it just does'nt live up to their first two albums, thank goodness they've now made return to form, but this just is'nt Oasis's best moment."
1,"Get over yourselves, please.","The Gallagher bros. are so full of themselves that they subject their fans to this mess of rehashed 70's rock. Every tune here is about 20 minutes long- if you would dig an entire album of ""Hey Jude"" and ""You Can't Always Get..."" here it is. Oasis' lyrics have always been pretty throwaway but here they are banally Hallmark. ""All around the world/ tell 'em what ya heard"" is as deep as they get here. Check out the Unplugged bootleg to appreciate Oasis without Noel's mosquito whine voice and forget this bloated joke."
1,Be Somewhere Else Now,"Bland, boring, nasal, banal, lyrically bankrupt, musically sophomorish, imitative, empty, hollow, stupid, not worthy of the CD pressing -- let alone comparison to the Beatles. There, I think that covers it."
1,Seriously Overrated Album Turned Telephone Commercial!!!,Oasis arrogance is way out of proportion to their actual talent which is miniscule. If you want something real buy any album from The Beatles or the Beach Boys. This is music for people that get excited about strip malls.
2,Hmmmmmmmmmm..............lets get blur's new album instead,"I can see what Noel is tring to do on this album, hes tring to keep the rock/pop theme but slow it down a bit. It didnt work,He ended up with a lot of boring, annoying noise.The best tracks on the album are:1. Stand by me2. Fade in-out3. It's gettin' better manThe ones to avoid are:1. My Big Mouth (pathetic)2. The girl in the dirty shirt3. Magic PieOverall, this is a huge disappointment and i would not recommend it."
3,so-so,"I bought this CD because I was in love with 'Morning Glory.' Turns out that wasn't such a good move. This album is just a continuance of the previous. There are one are two good songs, maybe more depending on your taste. As for me, I've already sold my copy."
3,3 - 3 1/2 stars: Not Bad,"It's not as good as the super-duper excellent sounds you would expect from Oasis, which makes it seem all the worse, even though it is infact good.All of the songs are drawn out, and seem to have one chorus too many tagged on at the end of them. It's a little annoying, but it shouldn't stop Oasis fans from enjoying this one.These were tough times for Oasis (according to VH1's Behind The Music), so you can't blame them for at least trying to make one epic of a record.My favorites include ""Stand By Me"", ""The Girl In The Dirty Shirt"", and ""Don't Go Away"". Multiply those by four and you've got yourself another ""What's The Story Morning Glory"" on your hands."
4,New Sound,"If you want the best Oasis for the Oasis sound, purchase ""Definately Maybe"" or ""The Masterplan."" If you want a great album of a different sound, buy ""Be Here Now."" The band was on its best behavior and performance, taking the time to make 12 quality tracks.Some of the top tracks, ""D'You Know What I Mean,"" ""Fade In/Out"" ""Magic Pie"" and ""All Around the World."" I hope that on their next album, Noel takes the time to sing lead on a few more songs. I have yet to hear a bad Oasis song with him singing lead."
3,Sing me something new... NOT!,"From ""the biggest band in the world"", this album sounds fittingly big time, but at the end of the day it's still stuck in pub-rock rut even as it tries to expand its musical reach. Noel Gallagher's lyrical rot persists, Liam Gallagher's still belting (they call it ""singing""), and the ""other three"" members are still, well, the ""other three"". But I'm still mad fer it, so here's an extra star for the catchy tunes and the effort, lads."
5,Massive record!,This album is great from Oasis but maybe not that great than the other albums. This album has a massive sound of rock n roll with all the guitars and electric sounds. And the songs are quite long. I would say that this album is a sort of rock n roll clishe album. Propably my favorite song from this album is It's Gettin' Better (Man! ) because it has got a massive sound and a good old-fashion rock n roll feeling. It sounds good. There are also good songs like D' You Know What I Mean? Be Here Now and The Girl In The dirty Shirt. Mad fer it!
3,Great fan of oasis,This album does not touch Definately Mabye but is still great. Advise to buy DM beforehand though!!
4,Underated,"I can't belive how much bad press this album get's. It's not a classic like Morning glory or def maybe but it has some really great songs. Too bad about Fade in-out and Don't go away, the 2 worst songs on the album."
3,Not Bad,"There's been a stalinist re-write of history on this CD.'The Greatest Thing Ever' on it's release soon evolved into 'A Misguided Overblown Epic'. Not surprinsingly, it fits pretty neatly between the two. The dross on here is simply pedestrian; nothing on here will make you want to throw the disk away. The songs are too long ('Magic Pie' and 'Do you know what i mean?' outstay their welcomes after the 8th guitar refrain!!!) and the constantly huge guitars do seem to hide some pretty weak songs.'Stand By Me' is wonderous and 'All around the world' and 'Girl in the dirty shirt' are defiantly celebratory. Though they come off as boorish morans in the tabloid press, the talent within their ranks shines through. And Noel has the best handle on fame that I've ever seen."
5,Underrated,"I don't understand why critics, fans, and even Oasis think this was a failure. It's easily their heaviest album through SOTSOG, and it has lyrics that are maybe the band's best. Sure, some of the songs sound distorted amidst the heavy guitar feedback, but the chourses in ""Stand By Me,"" ""D'You Know What I Mean?,"" and ""I Think, I Hope, I Know"" still shine through. BE HERE NOW even has some experimentation in songs like the countryish ""Fade In-Out"" that most of their other releases don't have. The Noel sung ""Magic Pie"" and the self-absorbed ""All Around The World"" are the only two songs that I skip over. The rest are simply Oasis playing good rock and roll with guitars roaring right behind them. Similar to the Smashing Pumpkins' ADORE, BE HERE NOW is one of this band's greatest accomplishments that basically was overlooked by fairweather ""Wonderwall"" fans and critics."
3,"Too long, too dull and too boring!",The first two Oasis albums are classics. This however is not. This album shows that Noel Gallacher has gotten too big for his boots - why make the tune 4 minutes when I can make it eight? - didn't anyone tell him that we do not need the chorus to be repeated 50 times? If anyone can listen to all of this album in one sitting then I take my hat off to them!
3,Good but definatley NOT brilliant,"I enjoyed 'Definitly Maybe' & 'Morning Glory' and i also enjoyed 'Be here now' but i didn't enjoy it as much. Infact it was quite disappointing. Me being an Oasis fan, i bought the recording as soon as it was released. But i was so disappointed i was thinking of getting my money back! Sorry Liam & Noel, but i think you could of done better. Better luck next time!"
1,"Go away, dog","The book ""Go away, Dog"" by author Joan L. Nodset and pictures by Paul Meisel is teaching children to mean to dogs. For example, page 5 yells at the dog saying ""Go away, you bad old dog. The author should be teaching kids to be nice to animals. This book should be banded from the children's book store."
5,"Go Away, Dog","I bought this book for my grandson. We have a dog, who he just loves her. He is beginning to read & loves books. He also loves any animal stories as well, especially dog & horse stories."
2,Nah ....,"If you have access to templates, or internet @ home etc. this book is not useful. I really don't understand the great reviews here. I think that someone could get the same information by strolling the internet for resume tips. Perhaps the information used on some websites is taken from this book. This is a petite to the point book, which is a plus and a minus because while it provides some advice, it is not useful on a regular basis which is why I refer to gathering the information online for free."
4,Bringing water to life !,"It's always a burning desire to capture as close the minute details in a scenary picture or the scenery itself. Water often proved to be the hardest to express its formless self.This book discussed in details the interpretation of water features using the different media like oil, pastel, water colour. All along, it had been thought that watercolour produces the best details with depth. But the book shows that other media can achieve similar effects as well.Many examples are discussed in step-by-step approach and illuatsated in sequences to teach about the built-up, so it's a simplified step to learning. Many medium are explore adding to the variety of expression that beginners can explore.Well formatted and recommended for beginners and intermediate painters."
1,Enjoy The Retirement Billy!,"I used to wish Billy would go back to his bread and butter and record another pop/rock album. Forget about the classical stuff and go back to what made him what he became - one of the best songwriters to come out of the 70's. And to not let the forgettable River Of Dreams album be his last say on the pop/rock world. But after hearing this rubbish, I hope Billy stays building motorcycles, and cruising around in his boats. This single may just be the most boring bland thing he has ever done, and after the mixed bag of his last three studio albums (Bridge, Storm Front, ROD) that's saying something.When dealing with Joel your best bet will always be his classic period 1976 (Turnstiles) to 1982( The Nylon Curtain) everything else is very hit and miss."
1,Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh maybe zero stars,What happens with Billy? It is the age what it has affected? Why it wants to be the cartoon of Sinatra?Honestly I continue waiting the return of great pop rock or good new wave rock of Glass Houses! But Billy sadly very sadly your music is made for old man's lovers of Sinatra. Argggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,An odd surprise,Had not a clue why I chose this from one of the kindle freebies. a bit of a tough read the style is akin to war and peace. Then I realized it was written in 1917. One day one of my work mates was discussing a date and a strange science fiction movie they saw. I saw a preview and that sparked further motivation and understanding of this book.
2,"good story, weak character development","It's an interesting story, and he describes the martian flora and fauna very well, but there are some things that are glossed over (like what happened in the cave) and the only character that is explored with any depth is Jon Carter."
4,Looking forward to more movies from this series,"Saw John Carter and loved it. Good story, action, and scenery of Mars, etc. Reading Princess of Mars on Kindle.My daughter works on the Mars Rover programs so I know the differences between the real and fantasy.Definitely recommend Edgar Rice Burroughs books to everyone for the entertainment value."
4,Mix of everything good in a book but must be patient,"Well written story. Hard to read at first with a cumbersome style of language but as you get into it, the story comes alive with great imagination, character development, emotional development, suspense, romance, action, culture, technology and everything else you want in a good book."
4,A truly amazing sci-fi novel,"I had never read anything by ERB before this, and now he is one of my favorite classic authors. A Princess of Mars is filled with non stop action and excitement.The book begins with john carter, the main character, revealing his past. He does not know how old he is or when he was born, only that he has seen many generations of his family grow up and pass on.After trying to save a dying friend in an Arizona cave, John wakes up alone on a completely different world. It is on this strange world (mars) that he meets Deja Thorris, the martian princess whom John quickly falls in love with.This book is fun from start to finish. Any fan of classic sci fi should read this facinating book."
2,Not a Little Boy,"""A Princess of Mars"" reads like a superhero comix. John Carter, a warrior on Earth, becomes a super-warrior on Mars because he weighs less there. He conquers aliens, wins the heart of a princess, and fathers an egg with her. As a fantasy for little boys, it's great. As literature for an adult woman, I'd give it a miss."
3,Exciting to read early Science Fiction adventure,This book was an easy read. It was interesting with simple plot/story-line. It was exciting to recognize the influence this book has on many subsequent science-fiction/adventure movies and books. It was a great book to read during travel where I had to start/stop reading often.
3,A Princess of Mars,"I read this book as a young teenager - around 14 years old. I actually read the whole series and loved them all. I recently saw the movie John Carter on TV. I never realized that it was from this book until I saw it- the name John Carter didn't sink in. If they had kept the book name, I would definitely have known. I decided to reread the book and see how closely the movie followed the book since I forgot so much as I am now 62. I am still thoroughly enjoying the book. It grabs you from the beginning and I am now 3/4 done and it is still grabbing me. I gave it three stars because it is not exactly a literary work of art, but most books aren't in my opinion. As for being a good, exciting, unusual read...I give it 5 start. i will probably read the next book as well"
4,interesting reading,"I find how interesting it is that Hollywood can take things in a book and switch things around without really deleting parts of the story. ""john Carter"" was very underrated."
3,not bad,"I read this after seeing the movie John Carter. It's definitely different from the movie and slower-paced. It's not as good as some of the sci-fi/fantasty books of our time, but for when it was written it was a decent book."
4,Classic Fantastic Sci-Fi,"I know the book/series is dated, but it's still a terrific read. This man was so far ahead of his time in imagination and futuristic ideas. I read many of his books as a kid and it has been a treat to read this one again. The chivalry and romance and epic adventure is classic even if the ""science"" is entirely BS. Burroughs' prose makes you long to know what happens next. Can't wait to read more!"
4,Very Addictive,"I read five of the books in one week!! I couldn't stop! Plots are excellent, action is fantastic, and the language is great too. I've never read a science fiction series so erudite and absorbing.I have no idea why Tarzan gets all the credit."
5,intriging on an out of this world experiance..,"The concept of being transported to Mars by an out of the body experiance or being lifted to another place is a masterpiece of wisdom by Burroughs considering his time period of life.. I read this book as a nine year old, and have started my son on the entire series last year.. he says ""WOW"" this is deep.."
3,John Carter ..,"I don't think the first person narration does the story any justice at all. It would have been a lot better in third person.The actual storyline is choppy in places and is written in a more steampunk rather than classic sci-fi way, but without the use of over the top futuristic languages or objects.I am not overly keen on the style or structure, but enjoy a well spun yarn.I am quite impressed by what producers have been able to deduce and create on to film. They have managed to give an inkling of this authors underrated talent.AVP-UK"
2,Narrator destroys the greatest book !,"The John Carter of Mars series of books, by my favorite author of all time, Edgar Rice Burroughs, is his best series.I was so excited to receive the audio version of this book, but when I listened to it, I was hoorified !John Carter sounded like a wimp. A girly Southerner, not at all the swashbuckling hero I envisioned.Now, maybe I'm spoiled by the narrators of other books, but even the weakest, most boring readings have not turned me off in the way that John Bolen has.Please Tantor audio, get some one else to read this, and make sure it is a Manly-Man !!"
2,A PRINCESS OF MARS,I ENJOYED THE BOOK VERY MUCH. IT WAS WELL SPACED AND EASY FOR AN ELDERLY PERSON TO READ. THE ONLY FAULT I FIND IS I THOUGHT I WOULD RECEIVE THE DUST COVER AS SHOWN IN THE ADD.I TRIED TO BE CAREFUL IN READING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BOOK AND WAS SURE THAT IT CAME AS IT WAS PICTURED IN THE ADD.
4,A Princess of Mars,"The writer of the original Tarzan character books uses his wildly creative imagination to create a story line which follows this hero John Carter from the aftermath of the Civil War to his mysterious transportation to Mars. Carter engages with the nine feet tall red warriors and the ""little green men"" (Is this where that phrase originated?). Mars is strife with the same racist animosity as his dear Earth. His fantastic ability to power through the gravity of Mars places him in a position of power on the planet and enables him to play the hero in big and small events on Mars. The Princess? Yes, she is lovely and lovable, and a bit of a warrior herself. E. R. Burroughs wrote this book for a WW II audience, so your grand or great-granddad and grandma will remember this writer through his books, movies, and TV shows."
5,Edgar Rice Burroughs first in the John Carter series.,Burroughs is probably better known for TARZAN but I enjoyed the John Carter series much more. This is Adventure in a fantastic setting. READ IT forget about the movie.
5,Classic,"Picked this up during the hype of the John Carter movie release. The book is a wonderful classic science fiction story, but one should be aware of the time and society during which it was written. The characters do not have modern sensibilities regarding racism and sexism. Still the work is an enjoyable adventure through a rich world."
4,Good read,I read this book because of the movie. But it was nothing like the movie. I give it four stars though cause it was still an excellent read.
5,Princess of Mars book,Great story. I recommend it to anybody. I wish I would've read it a long time ago; I feel like I was cheated by not being told about this book series when I was younger.
5,Excellent Read,"I loved this book! It is no wonder why disney adapted it to the big screen.As with all books turned into movies, the book is different but better. So if you are looking to follow the story of the film... just rewatch the movie lolthe moment I finished this book I went and purchased the other 6 books in the series... :-)"
3,An interesting read,"I downloaded this because it was free at the time. It's certainly an interesting read, and a good sight better than the movie, but it's missing something that keeps it from greatness."
4,Better than the movie,This is a quick read and fast moving book. Don't watch the movie too you've read it. The movie barely does it justice...unique book I would recommend to all
4,quick read,Great book. Quick read. Interesting story. Wasn't as long as I thought it would be but had a great story line that was a real journey to follow
4,A Princess of Mars,Extra ordinary in both its imagination and the age in which it was written. By far the best of the Mars books. Burroughs ability to paint landscapes with words and easy delivery of emotional gratification makes this worth the read.
3,Yeehaw!,"Pulpy fun at its best. Not much depth or character development here, but the creativity in the world building (particularly for the era in which it was written) is delightful from beginning to end. Doesn't show the same grasp of storycraft as found in some of Burroughs's later works, but it's still a fun, fast read."
5,Fantastic!,"This book is exactly what all sci fi and fantasy books should be: imaginative, full of adventure, plenty of action, and so much more. It is by far the most accessible book written more than 50 years ago that I've ever read, making it suitable for all ages. And, as other reviewers have stated, it is not just for boys. It contains strong female characters,considering the time that it was written. If you like adventure novels, you will love this book. I didn't have a problem with the formatting."
4,A great science fiction,"It's amazing to learn that this book pre-dates all of modern science fiction. I only heard about it because of the movie (which I haven't seen), so I picked up the book and read it. Outstanding."
3,A good read,I read this book after I saw the movie John Carter. I though the book was good though at times it seemed like I had to push through some parts. The book didn't seem to really make it feel like he was on mars for that 10 years. Overall a fun read.
4,Excellent Read!,"I am sorely disappointed that the movie John Carter did not incorporate more of this great work of fiction. It keeps you riveted from the start, the Barsoom of Mr. Burroughs would be a astonishing place to visit."
5,My favorite book ever!,"I read this book when I was in 5th grade. I read it over and over and it ends with a cliff-hanger that tore at my pre-teen heartstrings for several years until a teacher said to me, ""did you read the rest of the series?"" WHAT??? Paradise!I was lucky enough to have the hardbound edition illustrated by Frank Frazetta. The reviewer who said that the modern cover illustrations are too risque compared to the earlier covers obviously never SAW the earlier covers. This book is an early classic of pulp fiction and cheesecake/beefcake covers have always been a part of the deal.Burroughs was part of a generation of creative brains who would have thrived in the computer era. Thank god they had the chance to make their mark in literature."
5,Great book,Like Eragon...I first watched the movie and really enjoyed it. Afterwards I read the book and realized that the movie was horribly done when compared to the book.I liked all of the character building in the book and thought it had plenty of humor and action. There was no sex and cussing (that I remember) in the book for those that don't like to read that sort of stuff.On a side note...my inner immaturity laughed when the words 'fagged' and 'ejaculated' were used to describe feelings and expressions.Five stars!
4,A Princess of Mars,"I'll admit it freely- I only bought this book because of how desperately I fell in love with the recent Disney movie ""John Carter."" I just had to read the original story, and I'm not disappointed. For the time period it was written in, A Princess of Mars is well beyond its time, and absolutely satisfies my need for good writing. The storyline is altered from the movie, but a good read nonetheless. I thoroughly enjoy this book and am regretful of not reading it sooner."
4,The first 100 pages,We're very entertaining pulp fare reminiscent of the kind of books I read as a kid. I loved the Tarzan series and John Carter didn't disappoint either. Look forward to the further adventures of John Carter.
4,An Early Sci-Fi Classic,"Edgar Rice Burroughs, well-known as the creator of ""Tarzan,"" was also a pioneer in the realm of science fiction. ""A Princess of Mars"" was originally written in serial form in 1912. The story is painted in broad strokes, with generous helpings of adventure, combat, and romance. The writing and dialogue sound quaint and stilted to modern ears, and the plot tends to meander. Borroughs' science may strike us today as a bit silly, but for 1912 it's very creative and imaginative. The detailed portrait of Martian society is fascinating.""A Princess of Mars"" is a classic, and science fiction fans will enjoy it both for its curiosity quotient and its entertainment value."
5,Sets Fire to Imaginations,"Almost 30 years ago, my Dad bought me the entire series. I read through ""A Princess of Mars"" (my first novel) in three days at the age of 10. I read of the wonderful, fantastic adventures of John Carter, and was hooked--not just on Edgar Rice Burroughs, but also on science fiction, science, and, most importantly, reading.These books are not grandiose intellectual tomes. They are just pure fun! And that pure fun will inspire kids brought up with video games and Pokemon to go back to the basics and learn the joys of reading.Other reviews mention the need to get the second and third books in the series. I recommend you get them all. You'll never be satisfied until you're through them all, and then you'll be disappointed there are no more."
2,weak story but interesting ideas,"This book is a classic but suffers from any of the problems of antiquated sci fi. It is not character driven, but is more about the authors neat fictional idea and the character is more of an after thought."
4,Great Story and Presentation,Burroughs tells his stories in a way that captures your mind and involves you. The Princess of Mars we wholly unique and refreshing!
3,Liked & hated,"I liked read this book because ti is fantastic fiction, but I also hate this book because it was many murdering scene.I don't recommend it for childrens."
2,"Full of seminal ideas, but a bit tiring because of that","Certainly it is interesting to read ""A Princess of Mars"" from a historical standpoint - it influenced a whole century of scifis that came after. However, exactly because of that - and because of the awkward, convoluted writing style of old times - the book didn't catch much of my attention and was not able to kindle my enthusiasm..."
5,Welcome to Barsoom,"Retired confederate soldier and southern gentleman John Carter is pursued by Indians, and through unexplainable circumstances finds himself transported to Barsoom, also known as the planet Mars. There he finds a dying planet of brutal and untamed savagery, contrasted sharply with the rich cultures of ancient races. Arriving alone, naked and friendless, ""A Princess of Mars"" tells the tale of how John Carter, with the aid of his earthly strength and agility, sets forth on an incredible adventure against enormous odds to rescue the beautiful Dejah Thoris, the incomparable Princess of Helium.One of Edgar Rice Burrough's earliest works, the first chapter in the Martian series is also one of his finest. A page turning adventure with lots of action make John Carter one of Burrough's most beloved heroes. His imagination ran wild in creating the martian landscape, and this is a delight to read for all ages."
4,The one that started it all.,"I won't rehash the plot; plenty of reviewers here tell what the story is about. I will say, though, that this book begins the career of Edgar Rice Burroughs and that it's success leads the author to create Tarzan, Pellucidar, and many other stories. And more Barsoom! John Carter, Confederate veteran, fights, runs, leaps, loves, befriends and brings the races of dying Mars together when he isn't busy waging war or rescuing maidens. Actually, he brings the races of dying Mars together WHILE waging war and rescuing maidens. One can clearly see how Tars Tarkas begat Chewbacca, and how John Carter himself begat Flash Gordan, Luke Skywalker, and Superman... yes, Superman.And the second book, _The Gods of Mars_, is even better!"
4,Hooping Fun,"I really like the video ""Hoopnotica"". The instructions are easy to follow but hard to master. I'm glad I can rewind. I would recommend this video to everyone how wants to learn to hoop."
4,Great introduction to hooping,"I enjoyed this DVD since I am totally hooked on hula hoops right now. Its fun yet basic. Just teaches the basic moves and how to start out. I haven't yet mastered the corkscrews and I do wish the corkscrew lesson was more detailed, but this video has a good flow and I really enjoy it."
3,Good But I Wanted More,"I like the DVD. It was very precise and informative. I thought there was more too it. It teaches you how to do certain hula hoop moves but it doesn't have an exercise routine that goes along with it. I figured it would teach you how to do it and have a basic routine to get you started, but the whole DVD seems to be just a how to. I guess they put the exercise routines in another DVD. I would recommend buying it."
2,what i thought...a kid'z view,"The ""Gadget"" by Paul Zindell is the story about a boy named Stephen. Stephen lived in England with his mother adn his cousin. while ventureing out one night Stephen adn his cousin find then selves in the middle of a bomb attack. Unfortunatly, stephens cousin is killed. Stephen survived.After the attack, Stephen is sent to Los Alamos which is in the states to be with his father. His father is one of the top scientist working on a top secret project, controlled by the goverment. while at the camp army base, Stephen meets a boy about his age. they become good friends and go to seek the answer to the secret gadget.what they find out changed them forever in more than one way. i didn't really like this book because for the fact that it wasnt't detailed enough for me and it's plot was very simple, predictable and common. But one thing I did like about it was that thgere was a lot of historical facts in it..."
3,Star Thrower,"Zindel threw me off a little at the end by using the widely known ""star thrower"" story. Loren Eiseley's essay (upon which this starfish story is based) was not published until the late 1970s. I suppose that fictional young Stephen _could_ have made a similar observation and come to similar philosophical conclusions in the 1940s--similar to those of Eiseley's in the 1970s--but it seems a stretch. An anachronism that threw the rest of the book's accuracy into question for me."
5,Awesome Book but sad,This was an awesome book but the part where Jackson dies I think is the saddest part of the book because it hurts bad when you lose a best friend
4,The Gadget,"My Book The Gadget was a good book I would recomded this book to someone who like a action book. This book was about a 13 boy who was sent to the war to help his dad. His name was Stephen he was sent from war-torn England so he could help his father, his fathers is becomeing really obcess with the Gadget. What is the Gadget if you want to know what the Gadget is you have to read it a fine out."
1,The book that went Bad,"This book was not very interesting at all it did not capture my atention in any way. Although I read the whole book it was very dull there is no paspizazz, action , the details where not realistic. At the begining when steven's cousin was killed the book became opaque. Because the book started right after the boy was killed. Steven got sent to a military acedamy and was sent to live with his father. Know lets skip to the middle of the book he saw the adam bomb go off. he was in the fire of the bomb why didn't he die. Next the child went to see his friend Alexie who he fins out that he is an undercover spies for the war. Know when Steven was running away from alexie why didn't he have a gun if he has been trained by the army."
4,A Great book,"The Gadget is a book about a boy who lives with his mother in England during a war. His father lives and works on a military base in Los Alamos. His father is a physicist on the base. He is one of many physicists on the base that is designing and making the A-bomb. The boy meets a friend that lives neer the base and they become good friends. If you like books with action and a little mystery at the same time, this book is for you. This book will keep you guessing all the way till the end."
5,The Jam Band Jams,"You only have to see the Jigglers at the live shows to understand what appeal this band has not only in Boston, but all over the country. Jiggle The Handle"" is respected by musicians and fans alike, and their jamming is legendary. This album recorded live at The Stone Coast Brewery is a great follow up to ""Mrs. White's Party"", ""Three Sets"" and ""In It Again""."
2,iWhat's the big idea!,"I've heard all the albums, seen them live, and all I can say is ""Phish-Lite"". I'm glad that they are doing what they are doing, but they wear their influences on their sleeve."
4,good stuff,This is a fairly good import of the erotica single. It features a couple good remixes but I recommend the other Erotica maxi-single listed instead.
3,Review of original 1975 hardcover edition.,This novel is short. It skims over many action sequences and jumps ahead several months at a time between chapters. Winter seems to have been an outline for a much longer series of novels involving the characters in this post-apocalypic primitive world. The number of names and places thrown in are sometimes confusing even for the seasoned reader
1,wrong book right title,We were trying to get winter of the world by Ken Follet. So when thats avialble I will order it corretly this time. Dave
3,It's Okay,This case definitely protects the TX very well. It doesn't keep dirt and all the good little bits that can end up in your purse out but it stands up to my nephew. Unlike the picture my case only came with one slot for and SD card.
3,"Good, but Ugly","I bought this case after I received a Palm TX 2 years ago because I liked the sleek look. The case itself is sturdy and has protected my TX well, but aesthetically, it has not aged well and looks like it's taken a beating, even though it's only been sitting in either my attache or purse. The case is susceptible to scratches and blemishes that I can't seem to get rid of, no matter how hard I try. Although I should remember that ""looks aren't everything"" and that this hard working case has done a great job of protecting my TX these past 2 years, the metallic silver version is not for me, so I'm ordering the black version as a replacement."
3,Ok Product,"The case protects my Palm TX decently. The fit-n-finish is not as nice as it appears in the picture. However, for the price, what can one expect? The case has pointy tabs on the back and since it is made of hard aluminum, it will scratch wood tables or other surfaces.On Boxwave's link, it states $2.50 for shipping but Amazon charges $7.60. Not sure why. Amazon gave a credit for the difference."
4,A cheap insurance policy for your Palm,"This case fit my TX well, with good materials and workmanship. It works to protect while allowing access to all ports and buttons and is easy to open. No complaints on the fit and finish."
3,Protects and preserves very well to the Palm,Excellent product. Protects and preserves very well to the Palm. The only desventaje is that makes the palm very bulky and a bit tricky to take one!
1,NOT Update Internation,"This just arrived and it's some generic cheap knockoff: really crappy welds; box says ""Tar Hong,"" sticker on pitcher crossrefs to a ""Thunder Group"" item; and nowhere on anything does indicate that it is certified to be food safe.I would stay away from this."
4,Satisfied,"Perfect size for my morning latte or cappuccino. I fill it 2/3 full to leave room for a little foam before I transfer the liquid to my 16 oz. travel mug. It pours cleanly from the spout. Stainless steel pitcher can get quite hot to the touch from steaming, obviously, but the handle never does."
4,"Nice, could be bigger","Very nice! Great quality. I was surprised, however that I could actually use a bigger one. Even when I make just one latte, my espresso machine does such an awesome job at creating foam - my milk generally foams up and over the pitcher."
5,nice Pitcher,Received the item and it is just like advertised. Purchased it to replace a small frothing pitcher so I can foam milk for more than one cup of coffee.Nice quality pitcher.
5,Provides great frothed milk,"When I am making my daily latte, I always start by filling this halfway up with milk and putting it in my refrigerator while I get my machine set up. When my espresso machine is ready, I pull it out of the refrigerator and start frothing the milk. I can easily access the milk and make some good froth & heat up the milk quickly. Works great!"
4,Good 2 drink sized pitcher,This pitcher is well constructed and is the right size to froth enough milk for 2 drinks at once. No need for anything more.
2,Smaller than I thought,"Before you buy this, measure out 20 oz because it was way smaller than I thought it would be. Also, after washing this a few times, it developed a small spot of rust where the handle attaches to the pitcher. I thought stainless steel did not rust so I returned the pitcher."
5,Great for frothing milk,"I bought a new latte machine and this cup for milk frothing. I am so glad I bought the 20 Oz as the milk really expands when you froth it. Easy to clean, I do not put it in the dishwasher though, just hand wash. works great"
3,cheap,"I bought this because it had good reviews, was cheap and looked to function well. Mine is rusting a little bit along the inside lip. This is happening for two reasons, they use cheaper grade stainless steel and they were too cheap to polish the inside, leaving many small groves that are prime for rusting. Other than that this thing works just fine and as everyone else describes."
4,Nice pitcher,a perfect size for making two cafe macchiato's or similar drink. Heavy SS gage that I expect to last a lifetime.
4,Okay product,"I've had this steaming pitcher for a month and it is already rusting, however that can be fixed with the right cleaning product so it doesn't really bother me. This pitcher is really sleek looking and holds 20 ounces if you fill it to the top."
5,stainless steel frothing cup,This item is just what I needed for our new espresso machine. The item is nice and large enough to froth milk without making a mess.
5,Convinient to use,"Nice handle, fits perfectly my espresso machine. Shape of the nose makes sure milk does not spill.Overall, pretty good for its purpose, though a little pricey."
4,Great Product,I bought this for my wife to go along with her espresso machine. I like the construction of the pitcher but would have liked it to be a bit heavier.
3,good but its small,good item. but for my i really surprised from this actual size from the web size mentioned in the product information it is really different... but it done with me..thank u..bader
3,Psychology 4th edition,I received the book a little later than I would have wanted. The delivery standards given seem to make you think that it will arrive in 2 -3 buisness day not just it will be shipped in 2-3 buisness days and arrive in 7-14 days. BUT the book was in great condition and I would purchase from the same vendor again!!!!!!!
1,Psychology 4 Edition,worst experice ever trying to buy this book for my class. I never received the book in the first place. The seller hardly ever contacted me back. The first time he did was about a week or 2 after i emailed him. I did the a-z gurantee refund. I never seen that money either. I usually purchase all my books here and this time was extremly horrible!
5,Great book by a great author.,"I have read all of Joan Hess's Claire Malloy mysteries and love them. The author uses clean language, and is very amusing and entertaining. I like a good mystery as well. In this one, she is looking for people's stolen pets. I haven't finished it yet, so it will be fun to see what happened to the animals."
2,Primarily for Ned Oldham fans,Ned Oldham has been popping-up as a musician/background vocalist on Will Oldham/Palace records for some time now. Beware - this album portrays an opposite relationship. It is primarily a Ned Oldham record with a very occasional insertion of Will's voice mixed in the background. If you want to hear Will's voice - do not waste your money unless you're a completist.
4,"Read the suspense, imagine the space","I bougth halo 1-3 book package, so far I read the fall of reach and I am reading the flood, but I already can tell the fall of reach it's and outstabding book from eric, he refer's so many details specially in the space battles, it makes you imagine the cruisers the fights the crossfire, its exciting, I never in mi life read a book so fast, every time I decided to stop mi head did't stop imagine what will happen next or how it would look like."
4,"A little rough, but worth the low price.","I received this product on time and it has been a treat to read these books. It was kind of strange though, because my copy of the Fall of Reach is very worn, but the second two books are brand new. I guess I can't complain though. I recommend these books to anyone that is interested in science fiction, even if you have no interest in the Halo series of games."
4,Adds depth to the game,The books were written very well in the story style of the game. Because of that it added quite a lot of depth to the characters and explained a lot of the less-elaborated on nuances of the storyline.
5,Halo books 1-3,THis was purchased as a Christmas gift to my nephew. It came rapidly in the mail and was in great condition. My nephew was exstatic to be recieving this. Class A job.... thanks a bunch
4,Did you like the game,"If you like the game and don't mind reading you'll love the book. The book the Flood is pretty much a recap of the first game, but First strike is about the area between Halo one and two. Also, Fall of Reach tells where Master Cheif came from."
5,Incredible and interesting,This books are very useful on understanding the game if you didn't know it before. And if you are a fanatic of Halo you will like all the action involved in this wonderful books.
5,Halo the book what a good idea.,"When i first played the game halo i loved it. The gameplay was great music was beutifully done and supprisingly the story was expertly told.So when a halo book came out i jumped on it to see the back round of the story. And behold it turned out great. But its no literary master piece. To compare it, its like reading a Tom Clancy novel. The author seems to have a technical name for just about every piece of equipment.So to round this review up if you like halo pick up the boxs set but be warned the series is written by two author and you may feel a chnge of writting inbetween the books, but its still all good."
5,Great Set,this is actually my second set i bought; i think i lent my first set to a friend who i no longer remember and therefore cannot get back from. obviously i liked these books enough to buy them again despite the fact that i might find my old ones later.
3,Entertaining reading,"A fast read, but a little bit repetitive. If you like the game, you MUST read the books."
5,"Great, Great Books",These books are great. It starts off in a suspenseful environment and Eric writes this so well too keep the reader well entertained and keeps it with the videogame.The price and shipping timing were excellent. Go Eric and Go Amazon!!!!
2,Just buy The Fall of Reach.,Just buy the Fall of Reach. It's a fun read while the other two are big ol' stinky turds.
3,Mediocre,"The first book was good after that it just gets really redundant, i'm not a fan on how they choose to kill the characters off. Some of it is just really stupid."
5,Love the Game - Love the Books,"If you are a fan of the Halo games, you shouldn't be wasting your time reading this!"
3,Two out of three ain't bad,Book one and three were very enjoyable. Book two (the Flood) was hardly worth the effort
4,great books for the scifi and video game lovers,"excellent source of entertainment and knowledge of the Halo universe.Love the books, love the game. Love the game, love the books. It's thatsimple."
4,Challenged my beliefs about diet & medicine. An eye opener!,"The author is knowledgable and gets right to the point. Many important questions are raised. I am shocked when I realize the effect on my body of processed ""food-shaped products"", I am thankful to this author for the challengin my beliefs. Some of the language seems overly critical and extreme, but reasonable solutions are provided, and when I suspended my reactions I could let the good stuff sink in. Share your copy with your MD and see what s/he does with it.---DD"
1,Pseudo scientific mumbo jumbo,"This book is a strange mix of some sound nutritional advice mixed in with a load of pseudo scientific mumbo jumbo.As with most pseudo scientific works, it makes sweeping assertions without bothering to offer any backup.If you are not well versed in either science or nutrition, it's likely that you won't be able to distinguish the good advice from the waffleIf you know even a little about science, you'll probably get quickly irritated with all the gibberish in this bookIf this is supposed to be a book about good diet, then why the authors take such an anti-vegetarianism hard line is difficult to fathom.It's virtually an established fact that vegetarian diets and low meat consumption diets are far healthier than the average Western diet.When it's so apparent that the authors are clueless about science, I guess you can't expect any better.My advice is to give this book a miss and read a good book about nutrition.I'd recommend Patrick Holford's Optimum Nutrition Bible."
2,Buy the Originals,"Many of the numbers are by ""members of the band"" and do not give the true sound of the original. Some of the vocals are truly bad. Save your money and buy the originals which are readily available at reasonable prices."
2,Big Band Hits,"I really know nothing about this era of music, but I bought it for my 94 yr. old Mother-in-law and she is not impressed. However, she is picky, so her opinion may not count."
4,Nice assortment,"Not necessarily the best collection of Big Band music, but a very nice assortment. It's a good introduction, well worth several listens."
3,P. Jorgensen's Second Ed. of Salmon Flies...,"This is a nicely done revision of what was likely the most available reference at the time of the first edition. Poul has updated his text and finally, added color photographs to document his mastry of the art. Having dog-eared my first edition with use, I was glad to see and buy the new addition. Probably two things stand out as still needed: 1) better photographs of the techniques, and 2) more photographs and description of the classic and substitute feathers and their selection for collars, beards and palmered bodies. Note that this is very well covered in his videos.All in all, Paul Jorgensen is unquestionably a grand master of this art, and his book is valuable for that aspect alone. His methods are proven and his skill is tremendous, but that is a difficult aspect to communicate."
2,look cheaper than i thought,"it is a good product, but it looks like very cheap transparent plastic, i just got one to try them befor getting the whole set of sizes, but kept only the one."
5,"Looked great, worked great!",Great product! I received the product quickly and found it to be exactly as expected. It matched well with smaller and larger seperator plates purchased 4+ years ago. The Wedding cake it was used for received excellent reviews.
1,"Stilted dialogue, one-dimensional characters","I could not finish this book. Unlike the other reviewers, I was not the least bit impressed by the quality of the writing. The dialogue was stilted and the characters were one-dimensional. Save your money. Read Mike Tidwell's Ponds of Kalambayi if you're interested in a Peace Corps novel set in Africa. Tidwell's book is everything that The Road Builder is not."
1,Rip Off - No Video,"There is NO VIDEO in this thing, just music. If there is a video on the disc, there are NO INSTRUCTIONS what so ever on how to play it. The only print on this are a bunch of stupid rants about piracy is good. But there is NO VIDEO here."
4,Raiders Playing Cards,"I bought these cards for my son. He is a big Oakland Raiders fan and he loves them. The quality of the cards is good. Basically, what you see is what you get."
5,Loving,"This book is more than about relating to romantic love but also learning to love human kind, parent to child, yourself, etc. I really grasped the concept of how love has to be practiced everyday and like a skilled painter doesn't all of a sudden pick up a brush and create a masterpiece on a canvas, love is also an art that you have to practice everyday. You have to be a loving person in all that you do, not just romantically, not just loving your family, not just loving mankind, etc. It truly makes sense to me and since reading it, I've felt more appreciative and more open minded."
4,Marxist Critique of Love and Marriage,"I echo the sentiment that this is not a self-help book. If you're Joe Six Pack looking for some quick-fix PowerPoint presentation style solution to your marriage problems, you won't find that solution here. If that's your lot, just find a therapist who can set you straight in person. This book is a good old-fashioned Marxist-style critique, complete with denunciations of the connection between love and capitalism. In some ways, this book is more about capitalism than it is about love. I just wish Fromm were still around to write a book about Internet dating."
5,Great book,This book contains information to help understanding oneself as well as relationships that one person has. I would recommend it to people who are confused in themselves and the relation that they have with others.
5,The Best,"I have found this book to be one of the BEST books ever written about how one should really talk to and take care of oneself. Over the years, the idea of 'learning' how to really take care of oneself is soooooooo important and I have found this book to offer the central theme to both 'having a life' and 'having a good life'. I highly recommend the book to all people from late teens to early 'elders'."
5,Still valid,"I first read this book about 30 years ago and loved it. I re-read it recently to see if it's still meaningful and: yes, it is. It is not a recipe book on how to love and catch a mate. It's more of a philosophical work on why love is important in our lives, including romantic love, parental love, frindship and love in society at large. It also explains what happens in societies where material values take presedence over love for a fellow human being. The book is a classic, easy to read and understand, and the content should be common knowledge. Unfortunately, it isn't. Highly recommended."
5,Maravillosamente inspirador,Recomendable para cualquier persona que tenga preguntas en relación con su sanidad amatoria
2,I'm not in love with it,"I bought this book for a psych class, my teacher mandated the purchase of this specific book, and at the end of the class I ended up asking my teacher to consider another book to talk about loving. Fromm's book starts off with good insights into certain relationships (which is the only reason it got two stars instead of one) but by chapter three those insights are long since forgotten and replaced with hot air. Fromm tends to take a chapter to say what only needed to be a page or two. He talks in circles after a while and that makes the book unbearable to finish. I would recommend borrowing this book from the library not wasting your money on it."
5,Interesting.,"Very interesting book. Nothing really new, but a lot of obvious stuff we normally don't think about. Will make you think twice about your current relationship, and whether it is worth being in one at all!If you have some spare time and would like to know a side opinion about love - READ IT!"
3,Look elsewhere for the best,"First off, 5 stars to Pete Seeger for popularizing many songs that went on to become hits for other artists (Seeger, himself, actually only wrote 2 of the songs in this collection). My problem with this set is that most of the songs are live recordings which I find to be annoying. You can sometimes hear the audience make noises during Seeger's performances. Also, the offering is skimpy, only 52:46 minutes of music. Much could have been done to beef up this collection, including offering a full version of ""Where have All The Flowers Gone?"", though the 2 minute a cappella version is beautiful and a highlight of the CD. The liner notes and photos are good."
2,Pete Seeger's greatest hits,"I am a great fan of Pete Seeger, but there were just too many "" kiddie"" nonsense songs on this CD."
3,Pete Seeger's Greatest Hits Review,"The CD is OK. I bought it mainly for ""Waist deep in the Big Muddy"" since I am constantly reminded of the tune with the present situation in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, I have to agree with Pete Seeger on what are considered ""Greatest Hits"". Surely he didn't pick some of them. His repertoire is truly so vast that covers of other people's songs is not needed. It's rare that I enjoy live recordings as well and I skip the filler ""Lion Sleeps Tonight"" live recording every time because it's barely audible with all the noise at the concert. I'll remember next time to listen to the audio samples more closely before making a choice. Pete Seeger is a national treasure and I have a ""Weavers"" CD as well. I guess this could be termed a primer for some unfamiliar with his work."
5,A look at a popular form of needlework,"Whenever an embroiderer asks ""What book should I get to learn about historical blackwork"", the answer is always ""Blackwork by Mary Gostelow"".This book is very well written, and whilst I do not agree with all her conclusions about what blackwork is - her reasoning is logical and she includes lovely pictures - both of historical and modern blackwork.I would have liked to see some more pictures of historical works (especially colour photos) - and would have liked her to address some popular misconceptions about blackwork.All in all - I really do love this book and it is one that I always recommend."
3,"Della is great, the song is average","Della is a wonderful singer with a very strong voice and great charisma, but this song is a rather average ballad. You might know Della from supporting Marla Glenn and we all know she deserves better songs!! :)"
4,EWAN MCGREGOR FANS,"I ENJOYED THE BOOK A LOT, BEING A MCGREGOR FAN MYSELF,BUT I WOULD PREFER THAT IT HAD MORE INFO ON HIM AND NOT AS MUCH ON HIS FILMS AND THE PEOPLE IN THEM. OVER ALL, THE BOOK WAS GOOD AND HAD A LOT OF INTERESTING FACTS IN IT AND ANY EWAN MCGREGOR FAN WOULD AGREE WITH ME THAT HE IS PRETTY HOT IN THE COLOR PICTURES IN THE BOOK!"
4,The Isaiah Effect,"An eye-opener. Timely material, but sadly, very few people pay attention to topics like this, only serious seekers of truth. I can recommend this without any reservation as a new way to see the lost art of prayer."
5,"As above, so below","Not only is this man brilliant, he's also very easy on the eyes! ;-)Beyond the obvious, though, the importance of this book at this point in time cannot be overemphasized. When we are all feeling overwhelmed and powerless about what appears to be ""World War III,"" Gregg Braden points out that we are not powerless at all. Utilizing his tremendous awarenss of prophecy and the science of human technology, this man pulls together ancient thinking with current wisdom in a way that creates hope, excitement, and empowerment. I love the way he thinks."
4,Mind-altering theory,Braden's book has some important information about prayer as a positive force in life and contains material from the Dead Sea Scrolls that's been suppressed by both Jews and Christians alike. But it also offers a hopeful type of prayer that anyone form any religion is able to use.THE ISAIAH EFFECT is a deeply mind-changing book and takes some time to sink in. I'd recommend reading it in small chunks.My only complaint is that Braden could have condensed this into a long magazine article. He repeats himself so many times that I found myself skipping several pages at a time at each sitting.Lynn
2,Title is misleading,"This book is about 2012 end-time predictions rather than actually ""decoding the lost science of prayer and prophecy"". Just a disappointing read."
1,A waste of time,"Please don't waste your money or time on this book. Sure, it might make some people feel good, but it does it at the expense of their brains. In the intro he mentions 325 ad. He is referring to the Council of Nicea - which omitted certain gnostic writings from the Bible - oh, like the one in which Jesus had to remove Mary's imperfection- so he changed her into a man. The author evidently has a problem with the Council's actions. I would say more, but it all would be about the same. If you just have to spend your money on something, choose a good charity."
1,What does Isaiah have to do with this?,"This nonsensical book has precious little to do with Isaiah, making very little mention of Isaiah while dragging the reader from Tibet to Hopis in Arizona. Braden's baloney name-drops quantum physics, a subject matter that, clearly, he does not begin to understand but does know how to exploit for his mush-minded readers. What Braden also understands is the mindset of so many irrational readers who are positively triggered by words such as ""Decoding,"" ""lost,"" ""science,"" ""prayer,"" and ""prophecy."" Combining all of these trigger words into one book title evidences Braden's marketing savvy, attracting the ignorant and the neurotic into a mire of mystery and mishmash. Even the brilliant writings of Carl Sagan do little to educate people away from irrational and pseudoscientific gobbledygook such as is displayed in this silly, silly book."
1,The tragic waste of a tree.,"I was expecting a more scholarly work based solely on the jacket design. Very nice design. I should have looked at the bibliography instead. I recommend you pick up a copy of ""Horton Hears a Who"", by Dr. Seuss instead."
1,Odd,"I called Barry Farm and spoke with two women to find out if there is any possible gluten contamination with the beans. Neither knew if the beans could have gluten on them because they are from a supplier and don't actually grow them. When I asked who the supplier was she rather curtly said, ""I will not give out the names of my suppliers"". I found that odd, on so many levels, and wondered if her suppliers are in China. A company has never refused to give me their supplier before. The best part was telling me I could wash the gluten off when I rinsed the beans. Due to all the recall mania, I am not willing to gamble my family's health. Anyone else wondering what they do grow at Barry Farm? The whole thing left me with the heebie-jeebies."
4,GREAT SONG!!!,I REALL LIKE THIS SONG....VERY CATCHY IN WORDS AS WELL AS MUSIC.MY FAVORITE VERSIONS ARE:THE FULL INTENTION MIXES!GRAB A COPY...WELL WORTH IT!
5,Parkers Finest Hour,"I own almost every disc that William Parker has performed on and of the albums on which he the leader and primary composer this is the finest. Nice heads and song developement, strong soloing throughout and a spirituality that we do not often find in creative / free music. This is life affirming music that will surely make you think and appreciate what we as a collective share in this human experience. Parker is strong, his playing muscular yet graceful. Honest music presented without pretention. Highly recommended"
5,What jazz is,"Consider this the best album in the Blue Series, although it's not in the Blue Series. Powerful, extremely thoughtful and spontaneous improvisation, and a monstrous, earth-shattering groove from Parker and Drake. It also seems just about official with this album that Rob Brown is one of the absolutes of music in our time. His playing is truly singular and always full of surprise. The only question is, ""Why hasn't someone given Louis Barnes the album under his own name that he so obviously deserves?"""
4,I'm a pretty big sugarcoma fan,"First of all I have to comment on what someone said about Otep down there, Otep will always kick Sugarcomas ass, in every aspect. Better screams, better lyrics, better music. Actually the screaming here just sounds like she's constipated, but I still love the cd."
4,Medieval Love Story,"I enjoyed this book. The plot is set in medieval England and focuses on a young woman named Eveline who feels herself compelled to marry her deliverer from the Welsh. Her deliverer is forced to embark on a Crusade to the Holy Land before their marriage can take place. The two will be betrothed for at least 3 years, if the man returns alive. In the meantime, he has a very chivalrous and attractive nephew who will stand as Eveline's guardian. I was surprised by the ending which is unlike other Sir Walter Scott books. A good read!"
3,Greiving the Loss of a Loved One,"I purchased this for my partner who lost her sister and I was not aware from the reviews as to the religious nature of this book. So, I wasn't particularly happy with it."
5,A lifetime resource,"Kathe writes the book in a manner that enables the reader to pick and choose the right devotional resource to fit the moment. This approach provides a flexible, sensitive resource that speaks to a variety of circumstances when one may face the journey of grief. The book truly is a helpful lifetime resource. -- Carol A. Poore, author, writer and speaker specializing in topics of personal purpose, leadership and career/life direction."
2,Object-Oriented C++ Data Structures for Real Programmers,"This book has some good concepts and approach to the subject, but the examples have just too many errors, and some errors even cause system exceptions when you run them. Furthermore the author's web side, which is supposed to keep track of the errata, has no records of any errors reported. I personally sent notice of some errors, but received no response.It is just too frustrating to attempt to learn a subject with examples that do not work, a book that has no support after you purchased it, and the author's web site does not report or respond to its readers. Find something else."
1,Bad,"I don't know why one reviewer was so easy on Harrington. This book is just filled with errors. The web site isn't even available anymore. I am weary of these academics writing shoddy books,rife with errors,and then not even posting errata. STAY AWAY from this work."
4,Chicane and Bryan Adams...together at last :-),"Dont Give Up is one of Chicane's most commercially sucessful tracks (alongside Offshore and Saltwater) and i thoroughly reccomend it. One major gripe i have is that there are only three tracks on the CD, thus not making much value for money, but this track , which makes Bryan sound good, is still worth it. The Tomski mix is probably the best, with the strings at the beginning (at around the 2 minute mark)a beautiful addition."
1,Check part number with manufacturer to make sure it fits your vehicle,"Hey, I just wanted to let you know that there's something wrong with this listing. The ""Make Sure It Fits"" feature claims that #27302 will fit 2008 and newer E-150s, when the manufacturer claims that it does not and the proper one is #27344. Just call them to check and make sure that it actually fits your vehicle before you buy."
3,Low content book for a quick read,"I knew it would be difficult to get hold of a good book on object oriented databases after reading the Amazon reviews on the subject. This one is ok. It contains very little. It doesn't require any programming knowledge. It can be read easily within a dozend hours, if one doesn't try to delve too deeply into the examples - just look at the conceptually new things. I estimate the trustworthyness of the contents as medium."
5,Definition of Brilliance,"I cannot recommend this CD too highly. It is a stunningly brilliant, eclectic mix of ballads that ranks near the top of the immense body of work that Engelbert has produced in his long and illustrious career. ""Definition of Love"" was crafted with tender loving care to every aspect involved in its creation. The selection of songs, the lush orchestrations, Engelbert's phrasing and interpretation of his material collectively reinforce my opinion that he is indeed the greatest baritone of the past century. Every track is an absolute gem, but if I had to select only one song it would be ""She."" Go out and purchase this CD today; in fact, get two copies and give one of them to someone else who appreciates great music that is saturated with Engelbert's unequaled interpretative artistry. I can only hope that The King of Romance continues with his recording career for many more years because vocal talents such as his only come along once in a lifetime."
3,Smooth as silk,"I appreciate talent and Engelbert is top of the line of God gifted vocalists. I am just now re-discovering and purchasing all his recordings because he is that good. This Cd is smooth as silk just like his voice and while not his best its still not his worst either. Several cuts stand out like Definition of love, How slow we go, I want to wake up with you and his better than the Beatles version of Penny lane. He does a couple country standards and throws in his attempt at rocking but over all not a bad Cd by one of the worlds greatest singers."
2,LCD had problems displaying after 10 months.,"this clock looks pretty cool but the quality needs to be improved. it's absolutely not worth of $$.i bought one with an AC adapter last year which cost me $$ more. i like the LCD to constantly show the time at night so i didn't care the extra $$.it took a long time to receive the radio signal from Coloroda. but it was pretty easy setting the calendar, date, day, time and alarm. i was very happy about it until this February. the LCD suddenly went partially blank. i wouldn't even guess what time it was showing. i thought the batteries ran out so i replaced with a new pair. yet it still couldn't display the time properly and the LCD turned totally blank in a day."
1,never received,"Never received product, if price was wrong or something. Sent emails nobody emailed me other wise. Just lost my money, will not purchase through Amazon stores again."
3,Emperor rules!,"This recording includes the first 7"" ep:s from the five great ones: Ancient, Arcturus, Dimmu Borgir, Emperor and Immortal. For my opinion, Emperor and Ancient was the best of these and Emperor's ""ancient queen"" is one of the best tracks they ever made. Arcturus is good too, but Dimmu and Immortal weren't their best in this album."
2,Not very good at all,"Immortal and emperor are the only ones that should be here. Where is darkthrone? What about uh Mayhem?? Satyricon? Dimmu Borgir, please. They haven't done anything new. Other then the Immortal and emperor this is a bad list. I mean, Arcturus is good, but they have what one or two true black metal albums. Bring out the classics."
3,Not so interesting!,"I enjoyed the book for motivational purposes more than for any interesting revelation about running. I would not recommend it, it bored me at times."
1,Review of Chi Running,"I thought this book was pretty much a waste of time. A good friend of mine who is a practitioner of Chinese medicine recommended the book to me because he knows I'm a runner. He told me a little bit of what the book talks about before I bought it. Honestly, I got more out of that conversation about the book than I got out of the book itself. Turns out, I already practice ""chi-running."" The basic idea is to be aware of your breathing and your body while you run and work on having good form. Yeah, thanks, I learned that in high school cross country, except without the unnecessary baggage of eastern philosophy that Dreyer packages with the obvious running advice he gives."
5,A must read for runners of any level,"This is one of the most refreshing books of the subject of running I have ever read. I heard the author speak on CNN and was very intrigued by his technical and philosophical running advice. After reading the book, I tried incorporating many of the ideas into my running form. It really seemed to help lift me to a higher level of running right away. I really feel the difference in my stride and agility, as my running seems more fluid now and less mechanical. I would reccommend this book to any beginner, intermediate or advanced runner looking for a new approach to improving their running performance."
3,To each his own...,"I think many of the concepts featured in this book are useful in helping me improve my running posture. However, I think this is a concept created by one person that works for that person - and has fortunately worked for enough other people to become a 'craze'. Based on the number of years I have been a runner (25) and the number of injuries I have sustained (3), this system of Chi Running is not something I am going to spend a lot of effort trying to learn. The most useful things I took away were some breathing techniques and some posture techniques, but this 'flat foot' way of pounding the pavement simply does not feel natural to me.Just like everything else in life...take a little bit of different things, think and act critically about it, and make it your own."
5,A Must Read for Old Fat Guys Who Run,"I am 43 and had quit running because of knee and ankle pain. Then I read this book, and discovered that I had literally been pounding the pavement when I ran before. My joints couldn't handle it. Now I have no joint or back pain when I run. I feel like a kid again. This book is the best money I have spent in years. And for the reviewer that thinks this book gives you too much to think about when you run, I recommend forgetting the book and running barefoot. I suspect that you will end up incorporating the really important Chi Running techniques this way. Myself, I'd rather read the book and run with shoes."
3,Need to see it to believe it,"I've read the Chi Running concepts and they seem to make sense. But when I try to put it into practice, I have all kinds of trouble with lower back pain. If there were a reasonably priced chi running clinic in my area, I would definitely attend because I really would like to run with little to no knee and leg pain. The author makes it sound so easy but it's not."
2,Message buried in bad writing. Bad as in 'very painful to read',"I do think the author has a valid message. Too many runners run without enough attention to their form. Unfortunately the book is overflowing with self-reported testimonials litered throughout. The constant repetition of what the author perceives to be core messages will insult your intelligence. It caused me great pain to try to avoid skipping entire pages for fear of missing an important message. The author is trying to sell way too hard, which makes for an unpleasurable reading experience. It left me with an aftertaste of having read an infomercial for a DVD, website and training courses. My recommendation to the autor: read Steven King's ""On writing"". The current form of writing must be be limiting the success of this book -preventing it from realizing its true potential. I cannot recommend it."
2,Too much promoting,Have not finished book yet but already getting tired of author plugging his DVD .Plug it at the end of the book but spare us from mentioning it multiple times in the book.
2,Not what I was hoping for,"This video is fine if you are looking for help with form and stretching exercises. I was hoping for more about the ""chi"" of running, and ""chi"" in general. I love the bits I have read about Chi Running, but I wish this was a video of the material in the book. Then maybe I wouldn't feel guilty when I see the book on my shelf (mostly) unread. I'm hoping there will be an audio version in the future."
2,"Chi-Running, more like cha-ching running","I am a running coach and had heard all the hype about this book so I felt compelled to buy it. At the end of the day, the information was not nearly as useful or revolutionary as the hype suggests. What it is, is merely a copy cat of ""Pose running"" with Ti-Chi attached.Now I don't have a problem with Ti-Chi, I just think it was the ""juice"" to sensationalize a system of running that is already in play. Well written, not much to argue with, I just was hoping for a bit more unique factor from the author which I did not find."
5,Amazing Book! A must have for any runner!,"ChiRunningMy running coach told me this book would be a requirement for me if I was going to truly attain the goals I set for myself concerning running. I purchased it and have already read the book 3 times over. It truly teaches you a better and easier form of running. I have already increased my speed without any more effort. In fact, less effort. The book touches on every aspect of ones life and teaches you how to have a well balanced, well rounded life.I would recommend this book to anyone that is a serious runner or a beginner runner that wants to really learn to run."
4,To help a runner endure,"Good, common sense tips here regarding proper, low-impact running technique. The book advises the runner on mental focus and steers readers toward proper posture, foot placement and positioning. The basis of the book is similar to Romanov's Pose Method, also useful for reducing wear and tear.Pain in my hamstrings, knees and calves seems to be reduced using the tips found in Chi Running. Nothing earth-shattering, but worth the price for the frequent runner."
5,Improved my running and how I look at life,"ChiRunning helped me look at my running in a whole new way. It has improved my technique, but probably more importantly it has stimulated my motivation, improved my entire running program, given me tools and techniques to use in other areas of my life. Thank you, Danny Dreyer, for an informative, entertaining book on ChiRunning and ChiLiving!"
5,Best book on running EVER!!!!,This book is definately the best book for reference when learning how to run correctly.Its principles add mileage to your daily run. There is a lot of information in the book so I would have it on your shelf for quick reference. If you want to learn how to run... and have always hated the way it makes you feel. This book will get you through the tough spots so you can use running as a fitness regimine as well as a way to clear your mind. WELL DONE!!!
5,Changed my running and my life!,"I can truly say that this has made my running more enjoyable, more pain-free, and much more of a learning experience than just a way to suffer through exercise. I've applied it's principles to other areas of my life as well, including biking at the same cadence I'm running (180 bpm for me)."
5,Question about shin splints,"For Kate, who posted a little over a month ago, yes, the running technique in this book will eliminate your shin splints. I've had shin splints for about 15 years, and ChiRunning enabled me to run without my shins hurting. I had never thought that would be possible for me."
5,Purchased as a gift...,Heard many wonderful comments on this book and it was recommended to give as a gift. Receiver seems very pleased with the choice!
1,Disappointed,"After reading the many positive reviews and endorsements for this book, I anticipated something more thorough and more polished. The book is highly repetitive (the same amount of material might easily have been covered in 40 pages), it lacks organization, the author invents words which have no meaning (""instate"" as a verb, anyone?), and the typeset is HORRIBLE.The author has some good ideas. Let's hear them.....coherently."
3,It's not for the casual runner,"The process is too involved and requires too much work to master. I run a couple of miles 3-4 days a week, so it is just not worth the effort. I give it 3 stars because the program could be useful to serious distance runners."
1,Why is the Kindle version more expensive than the paperback?,"I enjoy reading on my Kindle, I would rather have all of my reading content on it. I like seeing new titles come out on it, so I was very pleased to see this book that I looked at availble. Until I saw that it was more than if I ordered the paper back.What are the publishers thinking? Does their greed know no bounds? They have no print set up or fees, no storage fees, no shipping fees and yet they are going to raise the price up for the same digital copy that they sent to the press? Did they somehow grab the music industry's winning PR notebook?While I want this book I am not supporting the publishing company's short-sighted and greedy take on what they think a digital copy should cost. Amazon had it right when they launched the Kindle $9.99 for hot sellers, yeah I can get behind that but I can't get behind what the publishers strong armed Amazon into."
2,If you want straight biomechanical and physiological advice.,"...then get Programmed to Run by Miller or Efficient Running by Cady. One has a PhD in exercise science and the other has a Master's degree in physical therapy. No spiritual advice, just sound physics, research, and observations of elite runners."
1,"powerful the title, empty the content",I bought the book with a lot of expectations and I was disappointed. The author keeps on sayng trivial statements as if they were his own discovery. Not a very useful book.
5,Essential Runners Book,"Training for the Salt Lake City 2007 (my first) marathon, i got injured and doubted whether I would be able to do it at all. After reading this and applying it's techniques, i found that my technique was all wrong (or non-existent). Determination and commitment were not enough for an endurance race! I thought running was something you 'just did'. Wrong.Not only did I finish under 4 hours, but i had an injury-free race and even felt fine afterwards.That was all due to the book - I can't praise it enough. I also bought the video too. It was the best money I spent on running gear - after my shoes!"
2,Audio CD is seriously abridged.,"The Audio CD is ""abridged"". What a joke! It is only a bit over 3 hours of audio on 3 cd's. It appears the author talks about Chi Running rather than reading from the book.If you have the ability to read and are interested in the book, buy the book instead.Listening to this is like listening the the author give a speech about chi running or an informative podcast about Chi Running. It's interesting and informative, but it isn't listening to the book as written. In fact, I can't believe this counts as an audio ""book""."
4,Upside Down Some Habits,"First and foremost: do not have it as e-book. This is probably true for most of manual-alike books (I had similar experience with a swimming manual), but with ChiRunning you are going to miss the at-a-glance capability only the paper can give you.Anyway, this is indipendent from the book, that is a GREAT book on running.I have read a great number of books on sport, several manuals and guides: this is something ""different"". The approach is different: here Danny, the author, start from Tai Chi to get to a new running concept.Well done, interesting even for a convinced Cartesian as myself, always critical towards Oriental disciplines (notwithstanding my long residential experience in Far East).Other than paper edition, I would suggest DVD: ChiRunning videos you can recover from the network are not exaustive (not at all).Probably a stage with a Certified ChiRunning Instructor would be the best completion, but unfortunately courses seem to be available in US only."
5,ChiRunning techniques work. Full stop.,"I have taken the author's ChiRunning workshop (which was outstanding), and this book details everything he talked about in the workshop, and a lot more on top of that -- plus, I have the book to refer to at my leisure.The techniques for running the author describes are impeccable, because the physics behind them are impeccable. The discussions, diagrams, and photographs are detailed and specific. The metaphysics... they work for the author, and if they work for you, so much the better, but even if they don't, the material in the book will be directly applicable to any fitness runner, racer, triathlete, or sportsperson.When I started doing ChiRunning I acheived *faster*, *easier* running, lower incidence of soreness and no incidence of injury, and feeling better during and after runs. I cannot expect more from a book on running, and have gotten *less*, from several books."
3,Take what you want from it,"Sorry, but I don't think Chi running is too terribly different from the older ""pose"" method of running described by Coach Alexander Romanov. A few important adjustments, but not a ""revolutionary approach."" This might be a very good read for new runners or runners who have never considered their form.The author implies that Chi running is ""effortless"" and that you don't use your leg muscles to run which is simply absurd; if it was there would be no need to train. The idea that you use form, posture and stride to work with gravity is very helpful and spot on, but still, one does have to move and lift the legs."
4,Great Ideas with some entertaining philosophy,"I highly recommend this book. The techniques in the book really do work, no matter what one thinks about the philosophy behind it. I'm 23 and have been running regularly for about 12 years, though only semi-competitively for about a year. In my sophomore year in college, I was training for the possibility of going into OCS and ended up overtraining. I suffered a relatively serious stress fracture by doing the things that the author of this book warns against. I recently completed a marathon using the techniques in this book, and was amazed at the improvement in my time, and the way my body felt after the race. These techniques are solid, especially for experienced runners looking to improve their distances/times. The Eastern philosophy sprinkled throughout the book is entertaining and, as with all philosophy, good brain candy to chew on."
3,"Enjoyable, common sense approach to injury-free running","What this book lacks in sophisticated, scientific presentation & execution, it makes up for with optimism and good nature. The author's good will and enthusiasm for running as an activity for people of all ages & fitness levels, is apparent throughout. Most experienced runners might not garner too much new information from this basic book, but it does have plenty of friendly reminders about form, technique and style and it's all presented in an extremely likeable fashion.As a multimarathoner, I did come away with a few good tips and ""food for thought,"" so it was certainly worth the time spent reading. I think, though, that it would be of greatest benefit with the companion DVD or a live class, for introducing newer runners to safe sporting."
5,A Beautiful Find,Many young pianists have the manual skills and dexterity to master these pieces but . . . the feeling and interpretation that Ms Bardin brings to us here in nothing less than marvelous. She puts you in another world.
3,"Great start, So-so finish","I really enjoyed this series. The fan service coupled with the comedy throughout made for a great anime. However, I was really disappointed with the way the series ended. It sort of fizzled out at the end, and did not come to a satisfactory conclusion. I have since learned that the manga version continues past where the anime ended, but there do not seem to be any plans in the works to do a 3rd season of the anime."
1,Not worth the time,"I checked this book out from my local La Leche League. I'm surprised they still have this book available. Being nearly twenty years old, maybe some of my problems are with it being outdated. However, my main gripe is that it is very condescending and judgmental. Instead of just informing you on different options (none of which would work for me and only one or so that would apply well to a full time job) this book presents a certain ideal and if the job arrangements do not fit that ideal, they're not good arrangements and you aren't a good mother. If you want helpful, non-opinionated advice, this is not the book for you. Currently I'm reading ""The Working Mother's Guide to Life"" which seems much more friendly and helpful."
5,Each story is like an emotional snap shot.,"As an aspiring writer, I bought this book to study the style of a well-reputed short story writer. I expected it to be boring reading. Not only did I get an invaluable lesson on how to write tightly woven, meaningful, and highly insightful stories, I enjoyed every one and was sorry when the 1200+ page book ended."
5,One of the best short story writers ever,"Mr. Trevor's stories are heartbreaking in their simplicity and clarity. Most often, he dissects the illusions which enable people to survive--and which are so very sad. After seven or eight Trevor stories, you begin to wonder if it is even possible to be honest with yourself. In this age where fiction so often is reduced to description, Mr. Trevor still believes in writing about love and death, honor and betrayal, duty and neglect. His physical world is narrow--usually limited to small-town or rural Ireland--but his emotional world is limitless. If you want to know how short stories should be written, read this."
4,Andre Rieu,"I would have liked a little more Broadway in this CD, but it's wonderful to listen to and the Harlem Gospel Choir rocks me down the freeway on my way home from work."
2,NY MEM.,I THINK THAT THIS WAS THE WRONG TYPE OF MUSIC FOR RIEU. THE FIRST DISSAPPOINTMENT WITH HIS ALBUMS.
4,OK BOOK FOR YOU,"Baseball Pals is written by Matt Christopher and it is about 97 pages and it has short chapters. If you like baseball books and one were there is a kid that wants to play one spot and there is a kid that is a lot better than him at that spot and they are the best of friends. This book is one that you would like if you have a lower reading level. One thing I didn't like was that there wasn't that much detail on the characters, but there is a lot of detail towards the games and what they are thinking in there heads"
4,HowI Rate my Baseball Pals.,"This book was a really good book. I especially like how it's a sports novel but also explains life lessons. The story is about two friends that both want to pitch for their baseball team but the team only wants one pitcher, one of the friends is the captain of the team and decides the positions and assigns himself pitcher. The other friend feels left out and they split up. This book has some great morals, 1. Don't single one person out. 2. Let everyone try. 3.realize your friends. By: Dominic, A Sixth Grader from Mainep.s. Matt Christopher ROCKS!!!"
4,hoping arounding,the second album in my dee dee list barbara sings as an angel and dee dee plays like a god
1,Let's pass this one over in silence,"This is an utterly poor effort by an aging hero. Dee Dee is obviously a very sloppy guitar player, he sings bad (not to speak of his wife Barbara's ""vocals"") and the songs.. well, they sully the memory of the Ramones' work on classical albums like ""Ramones"", ""Leave Home"" and ""Rocket To Russia"". Even die-hard-fans should hesitate to buy this..."
5,A Great Album hopefully Many more to come,"This is a great sophmore effort from Sparta. From ""The guns of memorial park"" to ""Splinter"" this has to be hands down the biggest suprise album that I purchased in 2004. While hints of At The Drive In still float in their music, Sparta has definetely struck out to seperate themselves. A track for those just getting into the band that you may want to check out is ""Vacant Skies"" on the Atticus: Dragging the Lake Volume II, A track well worth mentioning. Check out both albums you will not be disappointed at all. Maybe someday we will see a few songs with The Marts Volta and Sparta, can you imagine the possibilites?!?!?!"
2,Tepid,Ugh. Makes your estomac (stomach) twist-and-turn. Halfway through this album will make you regret that you've bought this album for 14.99!!!!! Crap :-(
1,better luck next time,"if sparta actually makes a good album i'll give all my mars volta material away. they lack any kind of creative thinking or flow in there music. they continue to try and re-hash the spirit of atdi.......zzzzzzzzzzz. not gonna happen.listen we all know mars isn't for everyone, but collectivly they are changing music,taking risks and devolping a new style of fusion... writing and putting together such timeless concept albums takes skill... also to have complete control over there music??? how many artists can say that? sparta take notice... try something new.. weak songwriting and catchy pop hooks will only take that atdi recognition so far"
4,Porcelain... Awesome!,"What's wrong with a band ""branching out"" and experimenting with their music? Sparta has really grown up since thier first album. Jim Ward's voice ""booms"" during the song ""Guns of Memorial Park"" and the lyrics are awesome! Someone else try and decipher the meaning to the lyrics. The song ""Tensioning"" is powerful accompanied by a beautiful guitar. Ward sounds really ""hurt"" in this song and reading the lyrics will make you see that he is describing very troubling times."
3,Average aggression,"High notes throughout the extended affair of sturdily melodic post-punk, but there just isn't enough momentum to sustain either the tension or beauty, kind of nobley floundering between both."
4,Very solid follow-up to Wiretap Scars,"I think Sparta have finally carved their niche with this album and proved that they can do amazing things post At The Drive-In. Amazing songs pretty much throughout, especially with ""While Oceana Sleeps"", Breaking The Broken"", ""Travel By Bloodline"". The closer to the album ""Splinters"" is absolutely amazing. All in all I think a very strong follow-up album to Wiretap Scars. The only reason I'm giving it 4/5 is because I think the production and mixing is a little below what Jerry Finn can do. But again this is simply my opinion and I do realize that they were probably going for a ""rawer"" sound that the last album."
