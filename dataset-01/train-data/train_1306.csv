1,An Embarrasment to the Industry,"Are you kidding me?!!! How can Zaccaro write a book with such a stupid title! Its irresponsible. Didn't he learn anything from his failed fund that had the ""distinction of back to back triple digit returns"" only because of overly inflated valuations?"
1,Somebody send this book to Carmen Reinhart or Ken Rogoff...,"... because it is hilarious that Amazon, when searching for their book on financial crises, also returns this classical example of why financial bubbles are NEVER different (compare it to a 1929 advertising of why stock could not crash that year included in Reinhart/Rogoff's ""This time is different"").While it is unfair to rate a book very few of us would read, it is obvious this work has no analytical argument as there is no serious, foreseeable way Dow would hit 30,000 in the short term (without a huge bubble and another burst at the middle).If you truly believe that somehow companies will triple their worth and the GDP of the USA will grow at rate of 25-30% per year, then by all means buy this book, contact your nearby Goldman Sachs trader and mention you want to participate on their Abacus XXV SPV."
3,PWNED,"I was here looking at another book, and saw this one as a suggestion. I just had to say PWNED!"
1,Because Wall Street is about OPM (Other People's Money),"Just in case you're unemployed or lost your savings in the Crash, this guy is still being paid $175,000 plus per year to throw around his beliefs. Sorry, no polyester suit in a cardboard box under a bridge, that's only for people who make money the old fashioned way, WORKING FOR A LIVING!His current Forbes bio is at, [...]"
2,"Only 30,000?","Why 30,000? I guess 36,000 was trademarked by that other guy a few years back. Better together with The Beardstown Ladies' Common-Sense Investment Guide? Thank you! Come again!"
1,Totally inaccurate,"I'm surprised they still sell this book, given that the Dow is not at 20,000, but is currently falling below 11,000!This book is a great example at how lots of charts (100s of charts and tables) don't matter. What matters is that the investor understand the fundamental influences, such as consumers completely over their head in debt, a glut of unsold homes resulting in depressed real estate prices, and a competitive global marketplace offering inexpensive high quality labor.I've been DOUBLE shorting the Dow Jones in 2008 and it's been GREAT. In other words, every time the Dow falls 10%, I make 20% in PROFIT! How many people read this book and threw all their money into the DOW only to see it transferred into the hands of folks like me who were getting money when the Dow went down? Thanks for the cash! I wonder where Zuccaro is putting all his cash from his book sales. Maybe foreign currency funds!"
2,I am put off,"Okay, I am in the camp of the people who thinks Rollins has had it. His best years, before, and right after 1992, they're gone, they're done. I heard Hank tell some of these stories before, and he has now changed them. I saw this piece of flotsam for free, I think perhaps Comedy Central. Hank is a very desperate man. His self indulgent narcissistic, survival of the fittest brand of garbage really appealed to me back when I needed medication, badly, but it's over for me. Hank, just drop the mike and leave. Don't go away mad, just go away."
5,Great for any drippy/saucy meal,"We bought these bowls to replace an older set of pasta dishes we had and loved--but only had two left. These are a bit more shallow, we don't use them for soup because we prefer deeper bowls so it says hotter. But these are excellent for salad, pasta, or any other dish where there's a drippy sort of sauce you don't want escaping from your plate."
4,nice but not great,these feel nice but the shape/style is not exactly my favorite. they're a bit too glass-white for me so that they look/feel like something that would be used in a hospital diner. they do feel strong and unlikely to chip/break. the big bowl is too big to be used for anything but a serving bowl.
4,Great deal!,"We needed a set of wide general purpose bowls and bought these since we had other Corelle products. These bowls are wide but not very deep. They were a little shallower than I imagined, but they function well for pasta and soupy/gooey types of meals. I have been very happy with them. This is a great price too!"
4,Good for pasta,"This set is good for pasta and more. Haven't used the large bowl yet, but the four smaller ones are good for anything with liquid or as a serving dish. Perfect size."
5,River Rafting Fun,"We purchased yet another Veggietales video and once again we were not disappointed. In this adventure Tom and Huck teach everyone that sometimes we have to put others ahead of our own ambitions. I always find myself watching the videos just as hard as my son. He absolutely loves this movie and so do I. A parent cannot possibly go wrong teaching this important lesson to their child. By taking care of others, we take care of ourselves. And I think Huck is on to something with Jerky Land. See if you don't agree."
3,So-So for a Veggie Tales movie.,"This movie isn't half as clever as ""The Wizard of Has,"" which was what we were hoping it would be like. The message is good but more complex than a lot of their messages, so it might go over the heads of the youngest viewers."
2,BORING!,"Maybe a 3yo will find this interesting but, this is the most boring Veggie Tales movie I have ever seen. The story was boring; the silly song was boring. I smiled a few times and laughed only once.The story is kind of dumb. Almost terrible. It butchers _Huckleberry Finn_ without any anything funny or endearing by which to redeem the spoofing.I used to like Veggie Tales, but for the most part the older VT stories are fine and the newer ones are poor (I haven't seen all of the latest, though). Skip this one."
2,OMG what a rip-off!!!!!,"The picture makes this thing look waaaaaay nicer than it is... the 'cover' is actually a fitted sheet that doesn't fasten on the bottom, so you have to tuck it under the bottom of the crate. The 'bumper' doesn't fit snugly (yes, I got the correct size for the crate I have) & it sags on the sides.... a nice little invitation for my dog to chew it up basically. The mat is Okay, but not the most cushy, comfy one in the world. Overall, I am so mad that I wasted so much money on this!!!!!!!"
2,Cheap and ineffective,"The only nice thing about this package is the fabric that goes over the crate. Even that is too small, but it works fairly well. The bumper pad only has tiny place to secure it to the crate, so it slides down and bunches up. The pad that goes at the bottom is way too small, and it bunches up whenever our dog moves around so he ends up just laying on the plastic crate. Very cheaply made, would not recommend. Would have been much better off continuing to use a sheet over the crate instead of wasting money on this."
4,Make your crate match your living room,"Since dogs are part of the family, they should have a place where the family hangs out. The crate cover made the crate look very nice. The whole 3 pc set is machine washable. The bed provides a decent amount of cushioning, though as my dog gets older (she's 7), I may have to add another pad underneath it. Be warned that the cover will shrink. I've washed it 3 times so far and it shrunk a little each time. When it was brand new, it covered my 42 inch crate perfectly. Now, the cover is 1-1.5 inches short, but still better than without."
1,bumpers just fell over,"disappointed in this product. For the price, expected great quality but not happy at all. The bumpers wouldn't stay up and just collapsed. The cover didn't cover either end and I needed one end covered as well for my dog that gets stressed."
3,Looks good but.....,This product looks great and washes very well BUT the bottom pad is way too thin..poor Pups...I had to buy a separate pillow to go underneath!
1,Poor Quality for Price,"This crate cover was very expensive for the quality. Like other reviewers said.......the bumper was a problem because it did not have enough velcro on it. My dog ripped it off on the first day in his crate. The crate cover itself also needed to have more to it. The cover did not have any type of velcro or ties to keep it secured on the crate. My dog was able to get a hold of it, pull it into the crate (because there was nothing holding it down) and he chewed & ripped it. It was runied the first day it was on the crate.Baiscally, it was a total waste of money (and totally not cheap). It should have been made much better actually thinkng about a dog and what they are capable of doing. I would not recomment this to anyone!!"
5,Perfect!,"Exactly what I was looking for, the fit was perfect and it does the job I needed it to do. Easy to clean and keep the crate cool or warm."
3,a suggestion or two.....,"the set is beautiful and does make my dog happier to be in her kennel - when she gets tired at night, she goes in all by herself! Less or no barking at night at bedtime for the family and no doing her business in her kennel any more. Suggestions: the velcro should be replaced with something that a smart dog can't figure out how to undo and chew off of the bumpers. Also, an elastic band across the bottom of the cover, to go underneath the kennel would keep my dog from removing the cover when she is not in the kennel. All in all, a good product, just needs a couple of small tweaks to be perfect!"
3,Just a recipe,"This is a very short article that includes a recipe for Tandoori Lamb. It gives a brief description of the cook and her background and interests, then the recipe.That's it.I found the original article elsewhere online. I'm very glad I didn't pay $6 for one recipe."
5,Music for the lover in you,"This cd has the songs that you have to love from Dru Hill. I thouroughly enjoyed it, was pleased with the price and delivery."
2,average Group,"Dru Hill had some alright cuts,but were a dime a dozen R&B Group. to me they were a Poor Man's Jodeci.sisqo had a decent voice,but seemed kind of gimmicky at times.""Tell me"" was a decent cut,but ""In My Bed"" was my cut by them.I dug the re-mix.everything else I could take or leave."
3,I hope that I can like this group,"I want to like this group and hopefully am going to give their album Icon a chance...there is much talent, but somehow the passion does not always hit me and that there is some dialing it in."
2,CD IS WAY OVER RATED,THE CD IS SO OVER RATED IT'S AVERAGE I'VE HEARD IT ALL BEFORE I COULD NAME A 100 BANDS THAT ARE BETTER AND THE SINGER IS A STRAIGHT POSER STAY AWAY FROM THIS BAND.
4,Jocelyn O'Roarke on the Left Coast,"Her relationship with Phillip Gerard on the rocks, Jocelyn O'Roarke heads to the left coast to take a part in a movie being produced by an old friend and to nurse her emotional wounds. The star of this movie is a former child actress who has gone through a patch of drugs and marital problems. Jocelyn's job is not just acting though. She has also agreed to coach the star and try to keep her on track.As usual in Dentinger's books, the death does not dominate the plot. Her cast of characters from the cowboy hairdresser to the crotchety photographer ""uncle"" pull the reader into Jocelyn's adventure in Tinsel Town. The author does not take the obvious or easy route as she puts her characters through their paces."
3,"Nice, its brighter than shown.","The colors are all brighter than what is shown. the deep forresty greens and blues are more like grass green and turquoise, and the gold is is a yellowy orange. Definately should be used as a sarong not a wall hanging. Other than that is very soft and drapey."
4,Best crash course for M.B.A. students,"Managerial Economics"" by Jae K. Shim and Joel G. Siegel (Barron's Business Review Series) is self-contained in two senses. (1) Answers and detailed solutions are provided to all questions and exercises. (2) This book is probably the shortest and clearest book to cover all the necessary mathematical techniques (e.g. linear programming, Lagrangean multiplier, partial derivative, regression analysis etc.) for doing microeconomics and finance at the upper undergraduate levelThis book is probably most appropriate for M.B.A. students who need a crash course to learn most important topics and the required mathematical techniques in microeconomics, finance, statistics, and operation research.The main drawback is that the authors are quite careless and made numerous computational mistakes in his examples and answers. [e.g. the answer to (1)in Practical Application of Chapter 2: Q = 400, not 40]."
3,Hardcore Mathematics with a Business Twist,"Definitely not light reading, Managerial Economics explores many different mathematical methods and models for variety of topics critical to manufacturing and sales. Plenty of good examples and practice problems."
3,Not for those who want form and function.,"I am a Kathy Smith fan; she did get me started working out and although I moved beyond her to The Firm and Jari Love, I have always liked Kathy as she seemed to focus on form. However, this DVD does not. It doesn't seem to know whether it is a cardio workout or a sculpting workout. If you use heavier weights, you run the risk of injury; if you use lighter weights, it is not long enough to get your cardio pumping. Further, Kathy does have a problem with not doing the same number of reps for each side; that will be seen in this DVD. I did like the unusualy movements; the body does move differently than in others; however, again, the speed in which Kathy seems to want to do this workout is not beneficial to those who may have a weak back."
5,Great Workout,"I did this workout last night and my thighs, butt, and sides near my ribcage are SORE! I felt I got a really good sculpting session as well as cardio because my heart rate was up so high and I was dripping sweat. I have been exercising with the Firm for years...so I was afraid this would be too easy, but it is definitley for intermediate/advanced exercisers if you use handweights (there is a lady in the video that does the exercises without weights). Great DVD!"
2,Not for the long run,"At first I loved this workout because it provided some decent aerobics with interesting moves and it did work to tone muscles. After several months of doing it twice a week or so, though, I had to drop it from my line up. Instead of feeling good-sore the next day from working out, I started to have pain in my shoulders and feet (!) that kept building to the point that it would wake me up at night. I reluctantly decided to give the workout a rest and see it the pain diminished. After not doing this workout for a couple of months (but doing others instead) the pain in both areas has diminished considerably. I do not think throwing those weights around, especially over your head, is good for much of anything. I also think there is something about all those twists and lunges that puts pressure on feet in an odd way. If you buy this, I would recommend using lighter weights and doing it infrequently as change of pace instead of several times a week as a regular workout."
4,Matrix Method,"I ordered the Kathy Smith, Matrix Method to try something new after using many of the Kathy Smith workouts over the years, and I have been using ""Lift Weights to Lose Weight"" for over 2 years and love it in addition to running.This is so much more fun and efficient. It works all body parts at the same time, upper, core, and lower and is easy to follow and fast paced. The workout is as hard as you want to make it or easy if you need to. The 10 minute core workout is quick and works the abs completely. I really like the relaxation stretching segment, it has helped my back tremendously. All in all, I am thrilled with this workout as it is a thorough workout, timesaver, and moves very quickly. I do not like to change routines, but this one is worth it."
2,Dissapointing,I ordered this because I used to do her workouts in years past. This was one of her worst workouts. I felt she gave very few reps before you were on to the next exercise... Not her best work in my opinion.
2,C'mon Kathy!,"I have always liked Kathy's exercise videos but this one is so disappointing. The reason is that she does not follow the beat of the music.Most of the fun of these types of videos is following the beat. It makes it a lot easier to get through a major workout. But on this one it's like they added some music after the video was made so the music is out of sync with the exercises. It's very distracting for me. I think the exercises are good, but nobody is following the music so it's no fun.Come on Kathy stay with the beat!"
2,Very Disappointing,"Kathy recommends heavy weights, but the movements are too aerobic to be safe with heavy weights, and using light weights would not sculpt enough. I'm really suprised that this is called ""Ultimate Sculpt,"" I think the name is misleading. It's mostly calisthenics with one section of challenging floor ab work and one ""advanced"" section that was just squats and lunges. Not challenging enough for intermediate exercisers. Didn't even sweat with this one."
3,Kathy Smith Matrix Method review,"I have exercised for years and have always liked Kathy Smith, I have several of her workout VHS/DVD's. Kathy is always very motivating and a great instructor but this workout was not as difficult from the cardio or weight training aspect as I thought it would be. It would be good for a beginner or on a day when you want a brief, easy workout."
4,Pretty good...,"I have a couple of Kathy's videos, and this one is pretty good. Took me a couple of times to get it down, but you can feel it. It's a nice set up, and the people look real. The hour goes by pretty fast. I think adding it in to my workout once a week is enough though. I say for the Amazon price, add it to your collection :)"
4,Worth every penny!,I owe a couple of Kathy Smith's Dvds and I like this one the most because it combines legs & arms at the same time. I recommend it!
5,Very good workout,"This is very good workout. It is not too hard, I would say moderate. It is mix of cardio with weights. I like how it targets all mussels. First it gets leg workout, then moves to core and then arms. I like that Kathy does not push one specific mussels until it hurts or burn badly, it targets hard enough, then moves to another set of mussels while first one can rest and relax. It is not hard workout, but I was sweating and was not tired after all. The only thing, which is kind of annoying, that Kathy does not do exercises herself but keeps running from one person to another, but I was enjoying and focusing on workout that after awhile, I stop noticing Kathy and her ""slacking""."
4,I like this,"I have definitely felt the effects of this dvd. I can see getting bored after getting into the rhythm of things, but I'm not there yet, so its working just as well as I need it to.And I like the fact that you don't need many additional things - just the weights, and a mat to lie on for the floor exercises.Overall, I'm very satisfied."
4,Laid-back Instro,"This is a cool album, but not just because it's full of good mid-tempo party tunes. The Blue Stingrays are Tom Petty's band, the Heartbreakers, featuring one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time - Mike Campbell. The songs all have a nice, relaxed groove and excellent guitar tones. Recommended for instrumental fans and Petty fans alike."
5,Uber-fun surf tunes,Has the same feel as Los Straitjackets or Insect Surfers. Buy this CD because you will love it!
3,More of a rock instrumental than surf,"I think this is an interesting CD for a rock guitar instrumental but I would not lable it a classic surf album. The Blue Stingrays don't play with the fire or intensity of some of the other hot surf bands out there and they lack the ""reverby"" guitar that really gives surf instrumentals their trademark sound. It does have a little bit of a retro feel though sort of like what a 60's rock instrumental might be like"
3,Computerized,"I didn't get see the Mistress of the Darkness in this show.All I saw was Computerized Things, and one Guy."
1,"no, no, no, no!","I absolutely love Elvira, but this is just plain stupid, she only shows up for bits and pieces. The whole premise of this is ridiculous. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Terrible and not even in 3D!,I should have known by the low price but this is a low rent production that's designed for large format and in crummy 1:33 and not even in a form of 3D I know of. I expected an anaglyph presentation but it's not! It's some long forgotten format you won't be able to use.The description gives you the impression you will see lots of film clips. You don't. Just a few very quick snippets of films in one part of the film. The rest is all corny padding. This one is ready for the trash!
1,Dated,This is an old 3D technology and is very dated. It is not compatable with the new 3D TV's that are out.
3,Only works with old cathode ray televistions. Buyer beware!,"A major caveat for purchasers:These ""shutter glasses"" 3D movies will only work on older cathode ray televisions.They will not work at all with modern Flat-screen televisions.If you have an old cathode ray television - you will enjoy these films.If you do not, you will be seriously disappointed."
4,My girl's like candy a candy treat,"For starters it is missing ""Candy Girl"" but since that is a Streetwise release, I guess they couldn't get the rights. It sounds exactly like the ""Hits"" compilation, which is an improvement over the previous releases.People might ask why should they get this. Well this album also contains solo hits from all of the members, even JG, who was not included in the ""New Edition Solo Hits"" CD compilation. If you already have all of the discs then I would suggest passing on this, but if you want all of the solo hits including JG's then go ahead and purchase.Let me add - the version of ""Rub You The Right Way,"" while the hit new jack single version, does not have the rap by CL Smooth. Just wanna let you know. The version on Number Ones has the rap."
5,GREAT!,Nice collection of their greatest songs. It would be great if they released those incredible remixes and extended versions on another CD collection. Call it New Edition - Gold (The Remixes)
5,Classic,"I was 17 when I bought this I think, this really got me into N.E.! Truly a very talented group, can't wait until their new album comes out (which features all 6!)"
5,NE - fan always!!,"This cd not only features great NE songs, but it also has songs from each members solo career."
3,Richard Les Crees - Paradise,"Solid Latin-tinged house from Richard Les Crees. He doesn't break any new ground on PARADISE, but rather does what he knows best with some panache. The vocals on ""El Ritmo"" give that track a fuller feeling than some of the other tracks, but there's nothing on here that wouldn't feel perfectly comfortable on the dancefloor. ""La La La"" takes a familiar riff (one echoed by Cibo Matto's ""Sugar Water,"" no less!) and makes you move. The breaks that kick off ""Good Inside"" also give that track some pop (although the synthesized horn line sounds a little cheesy), and the guitar riff on ""After the Rain"" also bring in some extra sunshine. The album passes smoothly and painlessly, a bright bauble that cathes your attention, and then disappears."
1,Seller withdrew from sale?,"I purchased and paid for this item. I recieved e-mail notification that payment had been recieved and another notification that book had been posted, all good up to here.I then recieved e-mail notification that seller had withdrawn on the sale and a refund had been actioned.The refund came through O.K. but unsure as to why seller withdrew on the sale? I did everything correctly. End of the day it was just a waste of my time.Hope this helps.Cheers"
4,Good early garage stuff,"love the old Black keys stuff. Wish I could own it on vinyl. I only got it for ""The Moan"" song"
4,My review,"I thought it was an good book. Lots of action, fast paced, believeable characters and a fairly good picture of the local history. I would recomend it to anyone who likes westerns."
3,didn't like it too much,"i heard a few songs off this album and enjoyed them. But when i decided to get it i was a bit dissapointed. Not all the songs sounded too different. Best songs are ""icing on the hate"" ""narcoleptic"""
2,Thrash fan,"this album is almost crap, it dosn't sound like death at all, bye their other albums instead they are much better then this one"
3,"ok, thats about it","I think enemy of the music business was better, I like this album also, but its just ok. No other word describes it. It sounds a bit repetative at times, maybe a little rushed in production (maybe it wasnt but thats what it sounds like. Still one of the best albums from this band."
3,Enemy Part 2?,Sorry but I heard it all before. It's not a bad recordbut does little to hold my interest. I actually likeEnemy of The Music Business but this one just seemsforced in comparison. The production on the drums isterrible. The guitar production is okay and Barney'svocals are cool but like I said it just seems a bituninspired and forced. Sorry guys...
5,GREATEST HITS......,".......of one of all/times best punk-metal bands. Spanning their beginnigs to their more crossover metal mid/period, if you just wanna have one RDP records, this is the one. But most likely it will make you buy their whole discography !!!!! Ultra fast metalcore !!! from Brazil !!!"
5,Very good series for anyone,"I love this series and I am not a big anime fan. But when I was first introduced to this, I liked how cool Spike was and I really think it had great character development. I also reccomend Princess Mononoke and Neon Genesis Evangelion."
1,You will regret this purchase,"This is a bootleg, do not get it, if you do you will regret it. I bought this thinking is was deal and when it arrived I was so disappointed. The quality was horrible and the special features, and menus were a joke which leads me to beleive this a bootleg copy. I know ""hey for forty bucks, why not?"" seems to lure you in, but thats all it is. I am a big fan of the series and I say support the real thing and spend the extra hundred bucks."
3,You get what you pay for!,"As an avid fan of Cowboy Bebop, I was excited to buy this excellent low-priced ""collector"" DVD set. But when price seems too good to be true, it always is... The video transfer is definitely sub-par. (It looks like a cheaply bootlegged video tape) On my HD big screen the action scenes are so pixelated that it seriously distracts from the viewing experience. My advice: wait until Amazon gets more of the full sets for $39.00 and purchase your Cowboy Bebop from that collection. You'll be glad you spent the extra 10 bucks every time you watch."
3,It could be better,"this is a good show it has its good points that will make you laugh and shoutg at the charecters but I was very disappointed with the ending, It sucked!!! But you'll always remember the best of it."
2,You get what you pay for,"Yeah, the old addage rings true.This ""cheaper"" set does contain all the episodes, but there are only 3 DVD's, thus containing up to 8 episodes per disc! (This refers only to the $... Perfect Sessions set.) Needless to say, the memory can't handle all the action scenes and smooth CG that Bebop is known for. What you get is a lot of fuzzy action. (The stills and slow moments are OK.)In a word, don't waste your money on this set if you value good anime, and the awesome pictures DVD has to offer. This set is lacking!"
2,Trying to be too cool,"While watching the series I was struck by the realization that the creators were trying to be hip. Perhaps I didn't get it, but I was hoping for much more from the series."
5,A genre all its own.,"As one of the buffers says, the series became a genre all its own. Considered one of the best animated series of all time, Cowboy Bebop told the story of 4 down on their luck bounty hunters who just can't seem to get a break. While the continuing story focuses around Spike Spiegal and his rivalry with Vicious, most episodes are self-contained short storys, straight out of the detective novels. Also, Yoko Kano's band, the Seatbelts, play the unique and awesome jazz and blues style music known as bebop for the background, giving the series an unusual feel, and in this case, that's a good thing. For now, only the series is available in America, but watch for the movie, Knocking on Heaven's Door, coming sometime. Make sure you see it."
5,In one word: AWESOME!,"The DVDs came much faster than I expected, plus there are all in great condition. A must have item for Cowboy Bebop fans!"
1,"Cowboy good, this deal bad",Read the fine print! This is supposed to be a 7 disc set. But whoever is selling this is giving you a 3 disc piece of junk. Better to buy the individual dvds.
2,Nothing special,"As a middle aged man, I have been watching films and television since a very young age. I've seen all the great movies, and I have seen all the animes supposed to be great. Although some animes may be good, not one can compare to modern, or old, films. Watching Bebop, I thought there was nothing special, midly exciting at times, but I've seen many shows that surpass it. Any one who's saying ""What does he know?"" right about now, might like to now I've written many reviews for respectable magizines here in America, so I think I have a valid opinion"
1,Cowboy Bebop: the Greatest space jazz anime ever!,"Cowboy bebop is one of the best anime series i have ever seen. the cool laid back atmosphere of bebop, comedy, and crazy action scenes make cowboy bebop a great anime. one thing to learn from this series is that you can never truly forget your past"
1,Why are people still buying this?,"I love this series, but the people who are selling this product are bootleggers. They shove the entire series on 3 disks. I'm sure this review section isn't just to rate the show, but to rate the dvd quality itself. If the back of your box. This has been out of print for a long while, there is a 90% chance if you find this product for a cheap price, then it's a bootleg. It should say on the back chinese subtitles. If it does, trust me you have yourself a bootleg. Very Bad quality(you'll notice a lot of pixelation at the action scenes if you bought the bootleg version), no extras, you are better sticking with a downloaded version."
5,Boxset review,"Well Im going to start off by telling you about the boxset it self. It has the 6 seasons dvd, the first ost, and well the box. This is the coolest box ever. It's like a case, you can open it and close it. Very tough quality, not just boxset where you slide the dvds in like robotech, or die hard. The ost is pretty good, but im not much of a jazz fan so i can't give a review on that.Cowboy Bebop is probably one of the coolest series to hit the states. It's a lot better then Outlaw Star or Trigun, some may disagree. It's not a series that continues on and on. Each ep has it's own plot. The overall layout is that it reveals each charater's past bit by bit. At first I found the music to be boring, but as it went along, I got with the beat. There isn't much thinking to do, it's pretty much flat out action most of the time.If you havent watch a lot of anime, or you only watch stuff on Cartoon Network, pick this up. It's probably going to be the first serious anime you will see."
5,One of the best anime ever!,"Watch out for bootlegs that promises to give you the whole show for around $40!The official Region 1 DVDs consists of 6 volumes, which have a dub that is widely considered better than the original Japanese. If you are considering buying the DVDs, you may want to hold off and wait for the ""REMIX"" edition that will come out later in 2005. The new edition will have 5.1 audio and improved video."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This item as listed does not actually exist anymore. The Perfect Sessions was a limited edition set that came in a very nice box, each of which was numbered by the manufacturer. I found this out the hard way after I ordered it and got a bootleg. The chances are very likely that any seller claiming to have this item is, in fact, only selling bootlegs with very bad MPEG video quality.Amazon should really remove this listing from their service so that no more affiliates can con people like they are.But as luck would have it, there is finally a real complete series box set out now. Go get the Anime Legends Cowboy Bebop remix."
4,Important question,I am considering to buy this but I have an importnat question. How many episodes is in this box set and what are the episodes? (please respond in a reivew)
5,THE BEST SHOW EVAR!!!,"I've seen alotta Anime. Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, blah, blah, blah...But 2 B honest, I really hated 'em! But then came Cowboy Bebop. I really fell in love with it. I first saw on the Adult Swim on Cartoon Network. And I stay up til 1 o'clock in da mornin' to watch it!But really folkz, it's da best show! In most Anime seriez, the animation is really lame and pasty, but Bebop has a nice, smoothe image. Also, the show has a true variety. It's got action, sci-fi, comedey, romance, and too much smokn' (which is pretty much da only fla0. So, great direction, great animation, great music, and as an adition, Ed is really cool ^_^GO BUY THIS SERIEZ! PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ!"
4,Cowboy heh?!More like Bounty hunter,"Cowboy bebop is one of the first anime shows i ever started watching it has tons of action plenty of comedy, some drugs(if your into that thing?i hope not)and plenty of ladies for those lusting men.How ever it is not a children show and children would mostlikely not be alowed to watch.The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because it does not follow up on the last episode except for a few which is becuase it would be a hour long if it was one episode."
5,The Best Example of Anime,"Cowboy Bebop is the best any fan, new or old, could hope for. Good story line, characters have depth, episodes can make you laugh or cry and the sound track by Yoko Kanno is brilliant. In fact, at least 6 CD's of the music written for the series are on the market today. The music was the first thing I noticed and that got me hooked. I have watched over 130 Anime DVD's (I counted)and Cowboy Bebop is my favorite above all the series I own or have seen. Buy it, try it, you'll love it. Keep an eye out for the feature length motion picture to hit the states later this year."
5,Perfect,"I am not an easily impressionable person, and few things manage to capture my attention indefinitely. However, when I was channel surfing one night and happened upon Cartoon Network's Adult Swim and for the first witnessed the masterpiece that is 'Cowboy Bebop', I was spell-bound. The funky jazz riffs, the smooth seamless animation, the profoundly moving plot, the immensly complex characters, as well as the hilarious side tracks and irrelevancies, are all part of what make this boxed set live up to its title: The PERFECT Sessions."
1,"Great Anime, Horrible ""Box Set""",The item description claims 6 disks and the sound track. That is not what I received. I should have read the reviews before finalizing the purchase. The episodes are no better than the files I downloaded online. Definitely not the quality I was expecting for a product that claims is original. This is a BOOTLEG. Buyers be warned!
1,Why is Amazon supporting bootlegs??,"This is a bootleg, pure and simple. The quality is sub standard, there are little to none special features. There is a real version with dolby sound on Amazon, get the real one, support anime."
5,Wait for the DTS!!!!!!!!!,"First of all, this is one of the greatest anime's of all time. But, I suggest, if you are going to buy it, wait until the DTS edition comes out in September. It will be soooooo worth the wait."
1,Horrible quality doesnt fit the description,Well the description for the product says it has 7 discs in it and i got a 3 disc set that have 8 or 9 episodes in each disc.The compression to make them fit filled the animation with artifacts and the result is a terrible quality for an amazing anime series.If you love anime dont buy this junk
4,Great Anime!,This is brilliant anime. The only anime series that I enjoyed more than Cowboy Bebop is Trigun.
5,|----Cowboy Bebop----|,"To start this off, I have this item actsually and I very much love it. It's basically futuristic and abotu a group of bounty hunters after outlaws who do bad things or steal things that mean a lot or cost a lot therefore they put a huge bounty on their head worth in yen which is Japanese money. It's hard to tell how much it is in American money, but it really doesn't make a differce. As Spike Spiegel and Jet Black wander around the many different planets in hyper space or not catching bountys they gather up a hacker girl named Edd, a dog named Ein, and a beautiful woman from the past named Fei (or Fae, pronounced Fay). All of which Spike hates. Anyway all their past catch up to them and something happens that I won't tell you and it's dreadful to the anime; made me cry! If you bothered to read this, Thank you!^^Arigato,-KilluaAny questions, e-mail warrior.killua@verizon.net"
5,MAJOR BOOTLEG PROBLEM,"The 6 DVD set is legitimate. It is also legitimately priced. However, the 3 DVD set is a BOOTLEG ILLEGAL COPY FROM HONG KONG. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT BUY this used for $30. You should never assume that you can buy a complete 26 episode set for 30! That is impossible. Dont be fooled by the cheap price and snazzy packaging. what you end up with is a illegal rip and also a questionably quality forgery. Please consider this. I know this is expensive, but if people keep supporting bootlegging eventually anime companies will start losding money, which declines quality of ALL anime. Dont support this bootleg industry."
3,sensual,Great flick to watch. Bought this video as I had seen the original 91/2 Weeks and wanted to see if the follow up vid would be as good and was not dissapointed
1,NO bueno,As I thought the first movie was horrible... this one was even more horrible. I am not a fan and my aunty told me to watch the first 9 1/2 weeks movie... I dont know why I thought this one was going to be any better.
2,poor sequal to a real hit.,"The first 9 1/2 weeks was about obsession, love, and the S&M; sub culture. In another 9 1/2 weeks you have a similar idea, but it is with a cast that just doesn't work. Miki does a fantastic job with what he is dealt with here, but his female foil is just so lame you want to give up. She tries so hard to top from the bottom that you are left hoping and wishing that Miki would just tie her up some where and forget about her. A big let down.David"
1,poor mickey rourke,i used to love mickey i thought he was so gourgrous what happened to him he looks drugged and hes judt going through the motiond another nine and a half weeks was almost as bad as exir in red i cant believe how bad mickey looked and acted i want the old mickey back from nine and a half weeks why did he have to mess up his face so bad he just looks plain sad and im sad for him what a shame but dont wasre your time and money on this movie its awful
3,The Female Actor,the red head was so not a good actress for this part she was horrible. Mickey Rourke Just Love him he's awsome.
4,How to Get Two complete trailers for upcoming releases,"Go to the disc's main menu and highlight the 'Play Movie' entry. Then press the arrow-up key and you should see the Trimark logo highlighted. If you press 'Enter' now, you will see the trailers for two of Trimarks upcoming DVD releases, 'Kama Sutra' and 'Chinese Box'."
3,another 91/2 weeks,"This was not as good as the first 91/2 week movie. Angie everhardt is beautiful, sexy and good in the movie. The movie just was not as exciting. It seemed like someone was holding back."
2,Dissapointed,"When I saw that there was a sequel to 9 and a half weeks, I had to see it. However I was dissapointed in the movie. The first one w/ Kim Bassinger was okay, it seemed like there was more of a story to that one. With the sequel though it wasn't good at all. It wasn't the worst movie I've seen, but the acting was deffinitely not good, and the dialouge was bad, and so was the setting for where they shot the movie. I think they shouldn't have waited so long to make a sequel to nine and a half weeks, or they should have used new actors. My advice to anyone thinking about seeing this movie, rent it first. But then it's still not worth the $3.99."
3,Not as good as original film.,"Would not feel need to watch this film for a 2nd time. It was more dark than the original. Mickey Rourke was the epitome of 50 shades, Christian Gray, in the original film. They only need to find a similar replacement for the proposed upcoming film version of the book Fifty Shades of Gray."
2,Point?,"I thought that this would be similar to the first movie. Unfortunately the only similarity is Mickey Rourke's character. There are some good sexual scenes, but mainly it's him brooding. His plastic surgery makes him look like he's got two balloons in his lips and therefore takes away his sex appeal. Overall, poor storyline and terrible acting. There was really no point to the story at all."
1,Fun for a laugh,"I am a nine and a half weeks fan (the original that is), and Angie Everhart spoils everything with her bad acting in this supposed sequel. Nevermind, about the movie in General, can't blame the bad acting when it was an all around non-starter. Most annoying in that it did not fulfill what it promised, not only in the erotic scenes but all around."
4,"Okay... So I'm a bit of an Egypt freak and was going into watching this with some positive bias, but...","I was still presently surprised to find this DVD watchable, and even enjoyable, as an adult. The show did incorporate actual elements of ancient Egyptian culture and history in a fairly accurate manner. So it was educational as well.And my six year old son (also inclined to be an Egypt freak, due to his mother's teachings) has dubbed this ""My Favorite Video Ever."" Though, to be fair, he tends to be a bit fickle about these things."
4,want all the seasons,I love this show and would really love if they put out all the seasons on dvd and not just a couple episodes here and there.
4,"Good strips, great filets","Both steaks in The Celebration are sufficiently large, and the filet is amazing. The strip is good but not great, but can feed two."
2,The Last Battle,"I didn't like The Last Battle as much as the other books in the series. I think it had a good ending, but the rest of the book seemed boring. In the other books it was exciting in almost every part, in this book it felt like nothing was really happening. The other books were fun to read, this one did not interest me at all."
5,Now at last they were beginning Chapter One...,"This book is the last volume in the allegorical Chronicles of Narnia series. The last King of Narnia fights a hopeless battle against evil yet finds glory. He discovers that reality and Narnia itself are mere ""Shadow-Lands"" which only mimic a truer place. A beautiful and spiritual novel, it should always be read last in the sequence of Narnia stories."
4,Very Spiritual but too easy to predict,"This Book was nice and full of messages , however there is some suspense at the beginning. But it all ends near the middle when you know that Judgement day is coming. Cs Lewis however did manage to set the story fairly well."
3,The Last Battle,"The Last Battle was partly confusing, but it was a good book altogether. A couple of major events are of course that terrible battle at the end, Narnia's destruction, and finally the part were the stupid monkey decides that he needs more food so he dresses a donkey in a loin's skin and says he's Aslan. I really think that C.S Lewis could have done a better job on a lot of the parts in the book. At least there were some good parts too. The setting is in Narnia pretty much all-around the country. The major conflict is the narnians against the Calormens. After the calormens took control the entire world of Narnia was destroyed."
4,"Good, from what I have read.","I have tried to read this book many times but I have never finished it. It's not that it was boring, I just couldn't finish it. I have heard that the last few chapters, which I have not read, are the best chapters of the book, and also that this is the best book in the series. I am going to keep trying to read it, and from what I have read, I would reommend this book to anyone."
5,AMAZING.,this book was a perfect ending to a outstanding series. all the loops were tied a very happy ending which is what i love in books- it was just perfect
4,Narnia's Apocolypse,"Yet again, another good read by C.S. Lewis. However, this is the beginning of the end where each chapter after that is better than the last as quoted from the book itself. See where Aslan brings his people, and what happens to those who choose not to believe. The real adventure has always been with those who muster up the faith, and believe without seeing. Although there is a reunion of various characters from all of the books, allow C.S. Lewis to take you on one final adventure through Narnia, where the new Narnia is one without end."
3,"** spoiler alert ** ""The Last Battle""","** spoiler alert ** ""The Last Battle"" was good because it is C.S.Lewis but it was not my favorite of the series. I really liked in the end how he brought the past characters back to make it a happy ending. He put a couple of twists at the end that I was not expecting which made it a happier ending. The book however as a whole was very dark and at times very difficult to convince myself to pick it up again. I am glad to have read the entire series because it truly is one of the best series I have ever read."
4,Not exactly the right book.,"When I ordered this book, I was looking to replace the one I had lost in my 50th anniversary set. I ordered this assumming it would be that book based on the image. However, when I received the book, the logo on the front said ""made into a motion picture"" instead of the 50th anniversary logo. All other components of the book seem to be correct. It is the right size and color and the first page is the correct one. I just wish it had the right logo as described."
2,(...),This book was one of the worst books I've read it needs to be tossed in a pit with the Shadowmancer and Eragon. In this book they said basically nothing about PETER the most important character. The battles where so mediocre that I fell asleep in the middle of them. I realized when I woke up I was at the end of the book. C.S Lewis could have done such a better job. This is a terrible read I urge you to avoid reading it.
5,Last Battle,"i love Puzzle! Puzzle is really sweet but easily misled.; Jill is cool. i like Jill, but sometimes shes very foolish,though most of the time shes not. Jill is good with a bow.; Eustace is okay, and good with a sword but sometimes kind of whinny.; Jewel is really nice but to eager to dig people's guts out.; The king,though very loyal and pretty nice he has the same trouble as Jewel.; Shift is a vile evil creature who was very mean to Puzzle and all of Narnia.; LOVED the book.........this is my school report. i did love the book."
2,Easily the worst book in the series,"I re-read this along with the rest of the series after having read them several times as a kid. They're definitely for kids, but still fun to read as an adult especially being able to remember reading them as a kid.This is by far the worst book in the series. It starts out well enough, with a pretty good story and some pretty good characters, including the new king, and some good animals. But by the end, it degenerates into a lot of feel good religous nonesense that just doesn't live up to the rest of the series. Having said that, it's still a must read to close out the series, but thankfully it's pretty short.If you're reading this series for the first time, be sure to read it in the correct order (starting with The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe) instead of the stupid order they are currently marketed in, as they will be much more enjoyable."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"The Last Battle does bring the return of some familiar characters from other books, in the form of a big old team-up.However, that is about all that is good about it, as the allegory shoveled into this gets really very groaningly tedious, even for a kid. Really pretty dull."
3,'The Last Battle'--Brilliant or Confusing?,"I have read all the other Narnia books over and over again, and loved them each time. But I only just now finished reading 'The Last Battle' though my dad tried to read it to me once when I was younger. As a seven-year-old I hated it--now I can appreciate it more. 'The Last Battle' is about how the wonderful world of Narnia finally comes to an end, but Aslan, the golden lion who created Narnia long ago, leads his people to an even better place. This truly is a great book, but it can be pretty confusing for yound readers! For anyone who has read 'The Magician's Nephew' 'The Horse and His Boy' 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' 'Prince Caspian' 'The Dawntreader' and 'The Silver Chair' this is a must-read, because the Chronicles of Narnia isn't complete without it. I still wouldn't incluse it on my list of favorite books, though."
5,Very informative,As one who has thoroughly enjoyed the British Costume Dramas I really appreciated this behind the scenes program about their making. Excellent theater. Superb presentation.
4,Fun and Informative,"This 5-part documentary is a fun look at costume dramas throughout British television history. It seems to have been made as an attempt to let the rest of the world know that there's more than the Colin Firth Pride and Prejudice, and that series got more screentime than any other, but overall it was quite enjoyable and packed with great interviews. (I did find it odd that the 1980 BBC Pride and Prejudice got zero screentime, but it was dreadfully dull so perhaps they had their reasons.)"
5,Sound and Sense aplenty,"Mullen's work rewards attention. It is playful and noisy, or musical, and it also has a great deal to say. However, it says what it says in a Steinian way, so it's best not to expect an essay or content that's always summarizable. The best example, I think, is her ""Dim Lady,"" a transformation of Shakespeare's Sonnet 130 into more modern terms. Other poems work similarly, like ""We Are Not Responsible,"" which in repurposing the language of the baggage disclaimer to ""relatives"" reveals or sends up, to me anyway, the sort of corporate callousness that leaves people stranded in an airliner on the tarmac for hours at a stretch.Mullen ain't Frost, nor is she James Tate nor Gertrude Stein. She's Mullen, and there's plenty to her work besides ""surface"" euphony. If you can't see the seriousness in her play, give her another chance; there's plenty of there there."
5,Delightful and Deep,"One of my favorite books of poetry; it has stayed with me through the years since I first read it. Mullen has so much fun playing with language. But she also shares deeper, subtle messages about society and human nature through her playful compositions."
4,Endurance,"If you can get through the first chapter you will love the rest of the book. The first chapter teaches you directions for understanding Genesis. The rest of the book applies it and you will be ""wowed""."
2,Should have added color?,"Good information, just black and white sketches of the plants! I did learn some of what I originally wished to glean from the book, but Color and clarity is what is needed in the mountains. The choice between problematic and edible plants can be subtle. Not worth the chance as a field decision assistant."
3,Good book,"This book is very detailed, but I was hoping for color pictures and it only has black and white drawings."
5,Fantastic!,"This book has no color plates, so I'd suggest that would-be foragers get a good pictorial herbal (a number of which anyone who forages should have anyway, as a matter of course) to go with this information-packed advanced-foraging book. This book is worth every cent!"
5,Excellent,"If your tired of Star Wrek you really should look at this Series. It is funny, smart, touching and full of action!! This is the only reason I watched the Sci Fi Network, it was a travesty what they did in canceling it, but with the NEW Mini Series coming this FALL you really need to watch Season 1 thru 4. I cant say enough how much I loved the fast paced stories and action of Farscape as well as the interplay of the crew of Moya and the growth of John and Aeryn's love. Its got it all if your looking for something good to watch this is it. For more info check out www.watchfarscape.com"
4,Great for Music but not that great for gaming...,The headphones are really good for music but when I connected it to Tv with my Xbox the sound quality was not that great compared to other gaming headsets.So its great for music lovers not for gaming..
2,It workeed fine until it didn't,"This worked fine for about 3 months and than the left channel stopped working. Of course now I have to deal with Sennheiser to get it repaired, wish me luck"
3,3 1/2 stars,One of my first pair of 'good' headphones. Sound was really good. Brights sound really sharp and bass was good enough. The thing is that one of the cables broke after 1 year and 3 months. I wonder if I can find a replacement. Good choice but treat them carefully!
5,you should get it,"it is a very professional headphones, imazing quality of sound as never heard before.it may be pricey , but all worth it ."
4,all-round decent light headphones,"Being the top model of the EH series, the 350 are a light semi-circumaural open headphones, at a right price for the sound. As they lay on the ears, they may seem to press a bit at first, but they lay firmly on the head and ears don't heat up very much, pads are comfortable and it is lightweight.The sound is well spaced and gives good detail, with a wide range. Highs are clear and bass is present too. They offer a good sound for modern, jazz, and rock music. For classical they sound a little dry for mid frequencies and limited for the 'warm' reproduction of an orchestra, for example.They have a low impedance of 32 ohm and can be driven by portable players, radios, with good sound aswell as with PC-outs or evenamplifiers. I like their natural sound for jazz and pop rock and I use to reduce the highs and bass to fully appreciate a flat response because they are always present in these headphones! Recommended and right for the price."
1,Cheap Plastic,"I had the impression after having read the many reviews of the various Sennheiser headphones that the build quality of Sennheisers wasn't the greatest. I decided to try these anyway, I received mine today and I have never seen a pair of headphone priced above ten dollars that were made so cheaply. I would guess that they would not withstand any but the most casual use. The sound is certainly OK but The Sony V6 is just as good and much better made. Say no to cheap Chinese junk."
1,Disappointed ...,Expectations were high and deal was good and then the package arrived and I did not see the quality that I had see associated with this product by others. It is poorly made and outclassed by 15-20 dollar sony headphones. the design is challenging and the sound was nowhere near its purported quality. The kids dont even want to use them for their computer. Nothing professional or dynamic here except me :)
2,Very good but ... not really :-/,Hello.Just a few words about those:A) Exceptional sound - the best headphones I've ever had. (third pair so maybe not a very comperative) ;)B) Left channel broke down after 1 day!!!!!!!!!!! :-(had to return them and bought Audio-Technica :)That's all.
1,Bird Of Ill Omen -- Ill Omen Indeed,"Self, Dare You Still Breathe? The debut of the band Bird Of Ill Omen. What ""ill omen"" being refered to is quite obvious, once beginning to listen to the CD. There are six tracks, all of which are hardly any music at all. It is more like someone talking into a microphone which is as close to their mouth as possible, without actually being inside of it. The lyrics are indiscernable, indecipherable, and would be completely unknown if they didn't include them in the booklet. Bird Of Ill Omen chose their name accordingly, as their music is an ill omen of what is to be coming constantly from this band. This debut CD is definately a downer, and maybe just because it is a debut. Maybe with the release of their latest CD, a new concept of singing and the ability to understand the lyrics will be found."
1,Army of Sociopaths,"Please refer to William Gilmore Simms book: The Sack and Siege of Columbia, SC to read about the carnage this officer and his men inflicted upon the innocent civilian population in their March to the Sea. The crimes against humanity this army participated in makes the Nazi SS look tame in comparison. I look forward to a historical film that documents this era from the southern civilians perspective. I hope the writer of this film is simply ignorant of the events surrounding the Grand Army of the Republic and does not support the removal and extermination Sherman and his army inflicted upon the old men, women and children they encountered. Vile, Vile, Vile...the character in this film is no hero."
2,An amatuer production & not a compelling story at that :-(,"I saw this recently and was really let down -- the production values are below-par, considering the rep and knowledge of some of the people involved.... it's terribly shot and the re-enactors don't look good at all, not convincing. The story is somewhat interesting, but why make a short film about this? Why should we care? I can think of hundreds of much more compelling stories to tell which would be even more dramatic for film... A lost opportunity to do a good Civil War set short... much ado about nothing :-(Why can't someone talented do a Civil War movie, why do they all have to be so poorly executed!"
2,A pre-hibernation tale,"Andrew was a very busy Scottish groundhog, what with his love of hiking and fishing. His Shadow didn't like to tag along for those activities and suggested to Andrew that he take it easy and hibernate instead. The Shadow bonked the groundhog on the nose to make his point. Thus is Andrew afraid of his shadow. From that point on, when he saw it as he emerged from his home in February, he ran back inside.This is by far the oddest Groundhog Day story available on the children's literature market today. The groundhog wears a kilt, knee-high stockings, a hat and a muffler. Not only is the plot strange, but the text is peppered with so many Scottish words that a glossary is a neccesary supplement at the end of the book. As a result, this is a complex approach to an easy subject; perhaps too complicated for the average young reader."
4,Further proof that the best music is underground music,"If you are interested in a group that plays with every ounce of emotion they can muster then this album is certainly a must have. Is it a masterpiece, no but it certainly ranks high with the music I am currently listening to."
1,misled about the purchase!!!!!,I was very disappointed to find the book I purchased was not in the condition I was led to believe it was in! The book was represented to be in good condition which was only half right! There were all kinds of notes written in the book( evidently the previous owner did not agree with the author of the book) which would be ok if I had been informed of this. I was very displeased and would not have made the purchase at three times the original price of the book if I had known all the notes were in it!!!Motor60
4,A great book! Yet not complete,"What a wonderful book! You can't seriously start writing professional VB application if you don't have this book. Any intermediate user should get it ASAP. Keep in mind, it's not for learning VB, you should first get an introductory book for that. However, I can't give it 5 stars. First, the book's first printing is from Jannuary 1999, it favors DAO a lot more than ADO (which is Microsoft's actual leading technology in data access) and he consistly uses ADO with ODBC (which is a good way to slow down a perfectly running application). Good overviews offered regarding SQL Server and Active Server Page, but just overviews. Get it, read it, use it. After that your application will be much better and you'll know in which field of databases you want to focus. If you want DAO then you are fine. For ADO, ASP or IIS you'll need something for more advanced users."
4,Great book for a beginner in DAO,Is a great beginners book it explains DAO and working with MS-Access using Visual Basic 6. It does not explan how to run a MS-Access query on visual basic at run-time. It is a great book for those for those working with a Three-Tier Cleint/Server Architecture.
5,Concise and Well-Written,I was being crushed by the number of choices and options in VB6 database programming...this book helped me sort things out and probably saved me months of poking around in the manuals.
4,Concise Examples from a wide range of Database topics,"Jeff McMannus, Database Access with VB 6. As its name says,this new book from Jeff McManus is completely focused on databaseaccess with good solid, concise, examples from getting started with MS Access to SQL Server stored procedures. You can immediately find samples of the new features like the Data Environment and Jeff even gives you the basic concepts to get started with MS SQL Server. What you get a wide range of subjects that is comprehensive. This technique doesn't present the depth you get in build a whole application style books, But I'm usually looking for that one clear example. While technical books are typically 'dry', Jeff succeeds in spicing his up with easy going humor.. As in a Q and A chapter summary use your new found powers for good.. not evil.. This is a good book for clear examples of a wide variety of database related tools. Pat Tormey PE, Editor,<I> World Wide Developer's Network<I>"
4,Another must have,Jeffrey writes extremely well and the previous edition of this book was the definitive book on the subject. This wasn't quite as good and lacks a degree of detail that a professional developer could need if messing about with data access but don't let me sound as if I'm putting you off...its a must have on your book shelf compared to some of the junk written on this subject.He's also unique amongst authors in that he actually replies to E-mails you send him...
3,A Thin Reference For Growing VB Programmers,"I worry that there may be multiple editions of this book; mine was published in 1999. ADO, the key database technology of VB6, isn't treated until Chapter 10, followed by a quick jump to IIS in Chapter 11. Had problems getting some of the examples to run; the website offered hasn't been up for quite a while. This isn't a bad VB6 database book, and in fact I'd recommend it for students developing their background in the historical development of Microsoft's Universal Database Access technology -- its presentation of the older technologies is great. This text won't, however, solve any problems you'll encounter trying to develop VB6 database applications."
3,How about advanced topics?,"Technology is evolving. How can you give a book 5 stars if it does not cover Data Transformation Services, English Query and OLE DB, especially with VB6?"
2,"Good book for beginners, but lacking in ADO/Advanced areas","I was expecting a little more ""meat"" in this book. Only one chapter is truly devoted to ADO programming and that chapter is basically a rehash of what you can find on Microsoft's website. Having read the author's articles in VBPJ, I expected a more advanced look at different ways to deal with database connectivity in the MTS/DCOM world, but that too was REALLY basic stuff. Disappointing."
4,Good Book But too Many Errors,"Good book, but too many erros in the code, or print. I have spent almost an extra hours figuring out mistakes so far, and I am only 1/3 way through!"
1,Poor book,"This book only deals with the most basic cases. The SQL server/ VB stuff is not covered well, and is not accurate."
3,Good book for beginner,"This is a good book for beginning VB programmer. If you are an Access Programmer, look for other book like ""Access 97 Power Programming"" will provided all the help you need for VBA coding."
2,You can do better.,"The basic ideas in the book are valid and well worth knowing but the presentation is disappointing. There are many reviews already posted that discuss the lack of color used in the book. I, for one, would have preferred that the graphs had been in color since 90% of the graphs that I do are in color. However, I could have gotten past that if one of the points was on how to make B&W graphs visually appealing. But the author didn't do that. The graphs that were obviously originally created in color were merely reproduced in B&W. To make matters worse, the quality of the graphs is poor. They look like photocopies of photocopies of photocopies. Also, while the book is 8 7/8 inches tall, the top and bottom margins are nearly 3 inches each, leaving only approx 3 inches for actual text on most of the pages! This might have been a worthwhile $15 book but, in my opinion, it is not worth near the $50 they are currently asking for it."
3,Need to Know s+,"This book showcases some great graphs but mortals, that is those who haven't mastered the R or S+ programing language, can not possibly hope to create what the author showcases. I have to agree with others who pointed out that this book is VASTLY overpriced. I returned my copy."
4,packed with examples of dos and don'ts,"I liked the approach taken by the author to show a good and a bad example of graphs about the same data. It's about graphs, so there is not much text, but it is making to the point remarks about errors in the bad graphs."
2,How many versions of Twister do we need?,"Yes I like to watch no brainer films from time to time, but I do wish this movie had more original material. Too much like Twister, except for the special effects which were not great. I admit to really not caring what happened after a bit. I was ready for the storm to hit so the movie would be over. Yes I do have an off button, but I like to finish watching to give full opportunity for redemption. This one is a miss in my book, even if you just want to see a simple killer tornado movie. Not the worst, but nowhere near the best."
3,Storm Cell,It was an OK movie. Nothing to brag about but had a fairly decent story and the acting was OK. I purchase the movie without ever viewing it.
5,Storm Cell,"I did not have a single problem in getting the merchandise ordered .. Amazon is the only logical place to order anything from asthey are ""secure"". If a problem arises with anything ordered through them, it will be dealt with in a timely manner. It'swonderful when companies use Amazon to sell their wares because they have to live up to Amazon's standards.I did not have any concerns .. the product arrived in grade A condition AND it arrived a little earlier than expected."
2,Not A Good A Movie at all!,"This movie does not even make sense as the title does not match the movie, For all perspective buyers, do not bother to buy this ""sucky"" movie."
4,Nice Flik,"I ordered this movie for my son. He is OBSESSED with tornados, hurricanes, ect. He watched it everyday(sometimes twice a day) for about a week! He loved it! I even sat and watched it with him, once or twice. If you or your kids like disaster movies, this would be a nice flik!"
5,The best NOFX album,"Simply an amazing album. NOFX here retains the earlier metal influences, speed and intensity, and yet the band is tighter and more proficiently melodic than ever. Every song is memorable. I feel that the five subsequent studio albums/EPs are very good too despite the progressive loss of the metal elements (The Longest Line, White Thrash, Punk in Drublic, Heavy Petting Zoo, So Long). The first two albums are not quite satisfying to me, even though the material has its charm and unique energy. IMO anything after So Long is sub-par and sometimes disturbingly similar, melody-wise, to songs found on Heavy Petting Zoo and So Long (some of the the guitar and vocal hooks are practically cut-and-paste, and yet it doesn't fit as well). I didn't get the chance to fully listen to The Decline, but it seems pretty good."
3,pretty good,"once again this is a really good album, but the quality isn't as good as some of the newer ones. If you like NOFX though, you will like this album no matter what."
3,before NOFX was that good.,"This album will be dissapointing to you if your into NOFX's later stuff. This is before Fat Mike learned to right good lyrics and melodies and none of the songs are refined enough. There is alot of potential in songs like 'Where's My Slice' and 'Moron Brothers' but both seem to just be bad precurses to better songs on later albums. Buy Punk in Drub, White Trash and So long... before you buy this."
2,Broke after 7 days,"I bought this rake on a Saturday. Used it 4x from Sunday to the next Saturday and the blade just broke off the handle completely. The instructions for assembly were lousy - hard to read illustrations that didn't tell you if you were right or wrong. I'm sure poor assembly contributed to this rake's short life in my hands. Try written instructions in the future. My new roof rake is 100% aluminum, no plastic. I'm sure it will last the remainder of this record breaking (for me) season and beyond."
1,Broke after 10 min,"After 10 min it broke.I went to return it to the local store, and the lady there even told me ""did it break here?"", which was a hard rubber connector to the head, and I said yes. Easiest return ever. They said they had so many break."
4,16 feet not very long,"I used this today. It requires complete assembly, but it's not difficult. The whole thing is very light-weight, which is good as you're balancing it at the end of the 16' handle length and thwacking it down against your shingles. I don't expect this will last more than a year or two as it isn't super strong, but a decent value for the price. The only downside is the handle length. I got this one, rather than a 24' handle, because I needed it immediately and the 24-footers were sold out. 16 feet isn't very long--it just nibbles at the lower section of my roof. I wouldn't try this from a ladder unless I have someone to hold the ladder--you're pulling unstable weight toward you, a scenario for disaster if you lose balance, with the happiest outcome just pulling a bunch of wet snow down on you. So, this length snow rake handle is okay if you have a low roofline, or a good ladder and someone to hold it."
2,Poor design,"The product was hard to put together. There is a square nut that goes into the base of the handle to hold the bolt which was very hard to get lined up properly. Also, the assembly directions were practically non-existent, and I ended up with two extra pieces that I had no idea what to do with. It was nearly impossible to get all the bolts tightened properly because of the way that the thing is assembled. Predictably, we lost pieces by the end of the first use.I wouldn't buy this product again."
4,Roof rake Garant Gprr24,Its a good rake. it got the job done. the only down fall when connecting all poles it gets very unsteady and harder to use so i used 2 poles and a ladder. And be careful of the ice on the roof. it will pull it down with the shingles as well.
1,Replacement Parts,"This has been a good tool, until my teenage grandson over worked it. Searching for a replacement blade which is tauted as available, I found only Garant site stating replacement parts not available to residents of the United States. They should at least set something up with Amazon or other U.S. distributor."
5,Great Roof Rake,"If you need a roof rake and everybody does........this is the one to get !! Light, easy to assemble, nice new easy grip finish on handles, long lasting and takes punishment winter after winter. The poly head will not damage the roof. Check nuts and bolts for tightness every once in a while. Will last for years."
5,Never Thought I Would Be Raking Snow - Leaves Yes - Snow No,We had so much snow and roof/wall related damage this year that roof rakes were at a premium. Couldn't get one any where and when the few hardware stores that had them received a shipment there were lines an hour or more long to get one. The roof rakes that were available had aluminum blades and the nuts and bolts loosened easily and were lost and had to be replaced. I didn't know what to expect when I ordered one with a plastic blade. What a pleasant surprise. Sturdier than the aluminum rake and more rigid. I would recommend this product to everyone. One last comment: Buy it now! Get ready for next winter!
3,a bit old,"This film was produced in year 1995, which is not listed in the product description. Therefore, everything in this presentation is obviously and clearly ""older,"" such as the quality of the images, voices, and the technology using to observe or document this beautiful creature."
5,Goya!,"Los Capricos and Los Disparates are my two favorite series of Goya prints, though I love and cherish them all. His technique and imagination; his nightmarish, evocative, satirical and raw subject matter (more mysterious in Los Disparates); his philosophy and fearlessness; his exquisite unusual graphic sense of composition in weight distribution, line, form, and emotional and tonal values interlock to overwhelm my mind with Goya's genius. His work is so damned complex! Another mind-boggling graphic genius is Lautrec but that's a totally different story and beside the point. He came to mind as I was thinking about transcendent compositions. Anyway, I have analyzed and enjoyed Goya's prints thousands of times and never cease to be amazed and humbled by the mystery that surrounds this artist's mind. His talent is unparalleled. Note: If you are not yet acquainted with Goya's prints, the two series I mention here are not for the squeamish, nor is Disasters of War."
4,goya,Very complete collection. Facinating images. I am glad I have this to add to my collection of art books
3,It works ok...,"I should admit that I am far from an expert on computers. I picked up this one for about two hundred dolars. I had to have a modem installed, and a new video card to play my copy of Freedom Force. But it runs quietly and (reasonably) fast, so I have no complaints about it."
5,DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE CRITICS,"I was very reluctant to buy this NOFX album , because I listened to these critics at amazon. But when I received it as a Christmas present I listened to it , and I must say this is the best NOFX album. I have no idea what these people were talking about , but they just didn't get it. Do not listen to these critics , hear it for yourself"
2,"Only for the die hards, folks","This is an early NOFX release, their first actual album to be released (to clear the confusion from below). All the songs on the unofficial ""Maximum Rocknroll"" were recorded before this, but this is the first full length NOFX put out. And, as the band would gladly tell you, it's pretty bad. This is NOFX at an early stage, before they took their music into the insanely great directions they have since. It's a very metal-sounding album and a bit amatuerish, but still a great listen for its humorous lyrics and obvious punk rock disregard for standards. Any NOFX fan will find it amusing, but don't get it for great music. You'll be disappointed. It was the first NOFX record I ever heard, but I wasn't a true fan of what they do until I heard White Trash. Anyway, don't bother with this until you have full absorbed Punk In Drublic (of course), Ribbed, The Decline, White Trash, and Heavy Petting Zoo. And Pump Up The Valuum is great too!"
4,The VEry very first one/.////,"this is the first official NoFX full length.....ok ok it's really bad,but I find it interesting and funny.....that's why I gave them four stars....give em a break fellas.....I know that anybody would imagine that this totally 1989's untalented band will became in an amazing,ironic super punk phenomenom some years later..........it's not that easy to imagine right:?"
4,"a good album, but quite different than their other releases","if you grown to like nofx from their later releases like punk in drublic, or white trash, two heebs and a been, then chances are you won't find this appealing. this album was from their earlier sessions where there was more of a metal/grind/hardcore influence to their sound. they still have their humor and satire in their lyrics, which makes for some amusing listening experiences. so, if you like nofx for their lyrics and their do it yourself attitude, regardless of how they sound, by all means buy this album. if you like more of a pop punk, softer melodic sound, then buy their later releases."
1,The Worst NOFX Album,"I really hated this CD, none of the songs on it are any good. I'd recommend any of their other releases over this one (Punk in Drublic is my favorite). I guess this would be for ""die hard fans"" only..."
2,not very good,"this was one of nofx's first albums and it is not very good. it's kind of [bad] actually. i never thought i would say this about a nofx album but it is very harsh on the ears.mike hadn't developed the skill of singing on this album and some of it is bordering on thrash. there are still some excellent riffs lurking around but the drums have to much reverb on them. it is high speed stuff but there is little melody or phrase structure.this album was before the masterful musician el hefe joined the band so there is no trumpet, no whiny guitars and generally no variation. this was the old style nofx before mike and co. discovered there new sound with high pitched backing vocals accompanied by the odd scream.this is one for the nofx purist only."
5,Experts in diversity,"The Girl with the Brown Crayon is a beatiful illustration of the intellect and insight of young children. As Vivian Gussey describes her last year as a kindergarten teacher, one is reminded of just how often adults overlook the example of tolerance and unconditional love that children provide to our society. Ms. Gussey uses the literary works of Leo Leonni to help the children explore such complex issues as self-esteem, racial discrimination and group dynamics. What Ms. Gussey learns by the end of this book is priceless, and the real ""teaching"" is done by the children."
4,Nice book!,"I just got the book today, so I haven't looked at it in great detail... but the overall impression is great. Too bad that only about the first 1/3 of this book is in color..."
4,Very Good Collection,"It is a very enjoyable collection of pop tunes of the 60's done in jazz style.Makes for good listening and even some dancing.I was looking particularly for the track ""Blowin in the Wind"", Bob Dylan's classic played by Stan Getz.I have fond memories of dancing to that as a young man at one of the most popular clubs in my area at the time"
2,infant size strap way too long for an infant,"I purchased these for my 8 month old baby in the infant size. The strap is way too long for him. They fit my 7 year old. I contacted the eye doctor that I purchased them from who measured a pair they had of the same size and a pair of the 3 to 7 year old ones and the strap was exactly the same size. The only difference was the size of the plastic frame was a tad smaller on the infant sized ones. I contacted the company and they would not tell me how many inches the strap is supposed to be. I had to alter the strap to fit my child. So unless you know how to sew and can alter the size of the strap, don't buy these for your infant. I think they would be OK for older children though."
4,As fair as possible,"I am a Catholic convert (from the Episcopal church) who was born and raised in Idaho and I therefore have many longtime and newer LDS friends. Perhaps they would disagree with my assessment, but I think this book and the Ostlings' ""Mormon America"" are fair and charitably written. This book is particularly good for Catholics trying to understand the LDS faith. It's a short book but packed with information -- not a quick read. At least it wasn't for me!"
4,Great comparison,"This book appears older (haven't checked the pub date), but it does what I needed. By providing a fairly objective view of LDS and Catholicism, it provides good information for those seeking answers to the type of religion they prefer. After reading the book, the last chapter sums it up nicely. It's wording of the grace and mystery of Catholicism is good--harder for literalists to swallow, though, I'm sure. The differences are so fundamental that to me, I don't see but one logical choice. I bought it to provide more reading for a daughter considering LDS without being accusatory of what she is considering. It will work for that. and it's good reading for LDS and others who misunderstand Catholicism or other mainstream Christian churches. The rift is large, and this clarifies, at least, some of its sources."
1,Very Low Quality,"What a disappointment!! The packaging is so bad, you think twice before touching it. I just feel like someone who bought a house to see it fall a week later!! Its amazing WB can sell a masterpiece as Matrix in such a bad shape! Too bad Amazon does not accept returns once the plastic wrap is open."
5,IT IS A FINE EXAMPLE OF POSITIVE HARDCORE,"LATELY, HARDCORE AND STRAIGHT-EDGE MUSIC HAS BECOME A SOURCE OF NEGATIVE OR VIOLENT IDEAS. IN MANY CASES, HARDCORE SHOWS NO LONGER PROVIDE A SAFE OUTLET FOR OTHERWISE HARMFUL AGRESSION. IN FACT, MOST KIDS INVOLVED IN HARDCORE ENCOURAGE THE HARMING OF OTHERS WHO DO NOT FOLLOW THEIR BELIEFS OR ARE NOT PART OF THEIR ""CREW."" THIS GANG MENTALITY IS NOT WHERE HARDCORE WAS MEANT TO LEAD. DUNCAN BARLOW, FORMERLY OF ENDPOINT, GUILT, AND BY THE GRACE OF GOD, HAS LEFT HARDCORE FOR GOOD BECAUSE OF THESE AND OTHER REASONS. HE IS NOT ALONE. ""WHAT WE BELIEVE"" IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF POSITIVE HARDCORE. INSTED ENCOURAGES WORKING TOGETHER, MAKING NEW FRIENDS, AND HAVING MEANING IN YOUR LIFE."
1,Lame,"I purchased this based on reviews & consider myself afan of all music, this just sounds so ""young"". Vocalsare weak & music is not much better. A very JR Highscreamo sounding album."
1,Not recommended!,Only works if camera is right next to the monitor. It looks like the manufacturer was just kidding intending this to work more than 2 steps away from each other. Nothing more than an expensive night light.
2,great idea but poorly made,I actually had a hard time keeping the flowers clipped on many places like the bookshelf and crib. They would flop over. The nightlight is awful. Goes on and off all night long which woke my kids up and frightened them.I loved the actual camera and video display...at first. Mine completely died for no reason after only 6 weeks. I did send it back and they sent me a new one but the new one is junk that only works when it wants to. Not spending another $11 to send it back yet again.
2,More than 10 minutes ...,2009R: I'll try again on a night when I have patience to listen to more than 10 full minutes of a narrative introduction. MFJLabs 2x
2,"Great images, horrible noir.","The cinematography of this film is amazing. Unfortunately, that is the only good thing the movie has.The writing is horrible. The voice over tells a choppy full of holes story over a two hour span that could of been conveyed in 5 minutes. The characters are all the definition of one dimension. They could each be summed up in a short blip on a single index card. The actors try to make up for the lack of substance by adding dramatically fake emotion to cliche card board cut-outs that feel out of context.If you took about 20 images from the movie and hung them in an art museum, I'd say they were great. As a movie though, it feels like a film school student's best attempt to get a C."
3,Decent...not as good as Smash or Ixnay,"Ixnay on the Hombre and Smash were great....so I figured why not buy another old Offspring CD? (I was introduced to them with Americana...more of a ""novelty"" album but still fun). This one was too....amateur. The lyrics just don't fit the beat...much like ""Me and My Old Lady"" off Ixnay. Smash was the greatest though."
1,"Could have been a lot better, it was really disapionting.","The offspring have gotta be able to do better than that. Compared to americana and smash, it was a lot worse. You're wasting your money buying it."
4,Rocks!,"Whenever I'm in a punk type of mood this is one of my favorite CD's to put in. It's great all the way through! The first three tracks will have you banging your head in no time. ""Dirty Magic"" is a bit slower but the opening riffs in that song rule! The best song on here in my opinion is ""LAPD"" They really tear it up on that one. If you like The Offspring then get this CD if you haven't done so already. It's essential!"
5,"Wanna hear something good, try this","This CD was my first ever exposure to punk rock. Imagine for a moment yourself as a child growing up listening to nothing but oldies and soft '80's music. One of my friends popped this bad boy on his new CD player and I just about blew my lid. I've been a punk rock fan ever since. I own most of the Offspring's albums and believe that this one is by far their best. There's an amazing mix of energy and emotions that give this particular CD a very unique flavor. Try it out, if you enjoy fast paced guitar and screaming vocals at all, this is the CD for you."
5,Burnin it up,"Alright, where shall I start. First off, if your idea of punk rock is the garbage played on TRL, ypu just gotta hear this CD. Two seconds of this CD makes ypu want to get up destroy something, if it doesn't blow you cpmletely away first. Songs like ""Get it Right"" and ""Nothing from Something"" show the kind of lyrics and insight into life that are as rarer today than gold. If songs like ""Kick him when he's down"" and ""LAPD"" don't make you want to tear up everything in sight, there's something wrong with you. Every song is garunteed to blow your mind into orbit if your used to that Limp Bizkit ##$$ and ""Americana"".In shoprt, buy it \now and you won't regret it."
5,My favorite Offspring album.,"I really like this album. I have to admit, it took some time to grow on me, but most great albums are like that. Ignition is heavier than smash, but lighter than their debut (which I didn't like at all). Unlike some of their later albums, this one actually has guitar solos and some really cool riffs. It's not just the same three power chords over and over again. The best tracks are ""Kick Him When He's Down"", ""Hypodermic"", and ""Forever And A Day"". Although this is a great record, I wouldn't recommend it if you are new to the Offspring. Buy Smash first. If you liked some of the heavier songs on Smash, buy this. If you liked the lighter songs, buy Americana."
5,nicccccccccccccccccccccccce,this is a truly awesome cd. offspring's true punk rock vocals and drums and guitars. there are some awesome lyrics and are very catchy like l.a.p.d (extreamly catchy and hilarious.) But if your parents have a problem with explixit lyrics then dont let them lissen to it because it starts out with fu** fu** fu** fuuuuuuuuu**. lol sill great cd not my fave thoe i sugjest Amaricana. happy lissening
3,bit dissapinting but ok,"this lbum is again pure punk offspring just like ""self titled"" but its missing something... its pretty repetive and the lyrics aare good but not as great as the first album , its worth owning if u are a offspring fan tho because its better thne anything tthey have done lattly nd will always be betterstand out songs: Session, kick him when he is down, no hero, dirty magic"
4,Great!!,"Ignition, The Offspring's second CD, is angry much like Smash and it is very angry, but catchy at the same time. It is alot like Smash and somewhat like the Self-Titled release. My favorite songs are Session, Kick Him When He's Down, Dirty Magic, and Hypodermic. It is my third favorite Offspring CD only to Smash and Americana.If you like The Offspring and you don't have Ignition, you need to pick it up as soon as possible"
5,Best punk CD ever,"This could be the best Offspring CD, but I like them all. Event ho they had a CD before this I consider this their first realCD because this is when they started their signature sound. All the tracks are awesome and very catchy, many are very emotional too. Standout tracks: Dirty Magic, No hero, Get It Right, and Nothing From SomethingDirty Magic hs got to be one of the best songs ever, its so great!"
5,Excellent- A must in any punk collection!,"This cd is great for any Offspring fan, like me, or anyone who loves the great sound of modern American punk. There's a lot of cursing- parents beware! But if you need good music to skate to, this is perfect. This, Smash, & Ixnay on the Hombre are all you need from the Offspring. Don't waste your money on Americana- that cd is a piece of trash. (i said it was good in my review cause at first i liked it, but once I listened to Smash a few times, I realized what I wasted $ on!)"
3,i dunno...,"Yes, I am one of those people who isn't a high minded punk purist. I am a bigger fan of the sound the offspring attained on their major label releases (except for ""ixnay on the hombre"") as opposed to their earlier stuff. This album just doesn't pack the musical puch that their more recent albums have. The sound isn't quite as original, the riffs are fairly generic and the songs just all sound the same. Still a good album, but doesn't compare to their other releases."
3,Raw but catchy,"There are definetly some good songs on here but i've never been a huge offspring fan but this album is ok and it would be the last time the offspring would operate without having platinum album expectations. ""Session,no hero, and LAPD are probably some of the offspring's best songs."
4,Excellent album for any fan of The Offspring.,This remastered vinyl is a great item to possess if you are interested in hearing some of the early material performed by this particular band.
4,ignition gave clues about the future of the band,ignition(released before smash) gave some concrete clues about the future of the band. It was the signal of a great album which came out to be smash. I don't like xnay and Americana very much but ignition is really cool and energic. If you like smash you'll like this one as well. So let's go to the world of offspring and fly with the cool tunes. An offspring fan should be different than a silly pretty fly fan.
4,One of the best(so far),"This album is, not as good as smash, but better than the rest, comparable to offspring. If u're looking for when offspring were still punk, here u go. if u want something alternative, get whatever is after smash. the lyrics are good, and not as lucky go happy as ixnay and americana"
5,Cool,"Day 1: Its OK, should've wasted my money on another CD (3 starz)Day 2: Not bad, maybe this is better than i thought (4 starz)Day 3: Awesome, here's 5 starz"
5,This is thier best cd ever,"I think this is The Offsprings greatest album.The guitar, drums and bass join together and make excellant music that gets stuck in your head.The best songs are Session,Kick Him When He's Down,No Hero,Burn It Up,Nothing For Something,Take It Like A Man,Get It Right,and LAPD.This is an excellant cd that just never got enough recognition."
4,One of the most underrated punk CD's of all time,"Before the Offspring became a household name they produced two albums which includes Ignition which was released in 1993. This is a fan favorite album as it is similar in style to hit album Smash. If you like that album you will probably like this one although it has a little more of an underground punk sound than that album does. I'd recommend it for the song Dirty Magic alone which is an absolute masterpiece, but there are a bunch of quality tracks on this CD.Best Tracks:SessionKick Him When He's DownDirty MagicNo HeroForever and a Day"
2,Dorman replacement mirrow Chevy truck 2006,"I did not like mirror after replacing ,it shook bad while driving down interstate and moving slowly on my street would not recommend."
4,Poke'mon = GREAT!,"I have all 4 of these books. I think they are cool, but it is not well based on the real Poke'mon. Like, for instance, in number 3, Ash battles Brock and wins EASILY, but Pikachu would have been weak against Onix and the Geodudes. And in number 1, Ash finds Pikachu under the floorboards! Really, Ash gets Pikachu from Proffeser Oak! But still, these are cool book!"
5,The Best Comic I've Ever Read,"This is probably the best comic I've ever read. It's actually a four book series (The Electric Tale of Pikachu, Pikachu Shocks Back, Electic Pikachu Boogaloo and Surf's Up Pikachu). I got these when the first came out when they were magazines with flimsy covers and pages you have to be extremely careful with. When I finally got around to getting the last to parts they had finally been released in paperback. I liked the paperback so much that I bought the other two parts in paperback. I'd recommend that you get the paperback for several reasons. First of all: It's easier to store. Second: It's easier to carry around with you. The magazines are actually four different magazines each part. (So in total you would have 16 little magazines to carry around if you wanted to have them with you. A real hassle.. trust me)."
5,Pikachu is the best!!!,"This book is great for both Pokemon and Anime lovers, if you don't have this book, forshame."
3,For the ADHD kid in you...,"This has got to be the fastest paced, most hyper story line I've ever read. Don't get me wrong, I loved it. But man is it a quick read."
3,The Original Japanese Manga Was Better,"Hey guys! If you are mature enough, you should get the original Pokemon manga drawn by Ono Toshihiro. The original Japanese one, which is uncensored is much, much better. The graphics that Tentomushi Comics Special uses has to be a lot crisper and the paper is whiter. It is better. The English one isn't as bad, but a little bit too much editing. I own the manga graphic novels for #1 and #2 of the English and #1 and #4 in Japanese. I rated this three stars because of the censorship which I think is bad. People should read it the way it is meant to be seen. (...)"
4,Very helpful for this dummy!,"Very helpful book. I am verygrateful that PowerPoint has charts and graphs built in. Sales Forecasting is essential for any leader. In order to make effective decisions concerning resources and direction, without in-depth forecasting skills, one is either throwing darts blind folder or just wasting your firms money"
2,"Average Information with Zero ""WOW"" Factor","I was expecting new and interesting ideas from this book, but was disappointed. If you truly have no idea how to find a sales baseline for your business or don't know how to track trends, this book is for you. If you are like me (you know the basics but were trying to find a more thorough approach), I wouldn't buy the book."
3,"Good, not great on forecasting",Purchased this a reference document for developing forecast models with Excel. Skimmed through it but haven't come back to it.
1,Very disappointing!,"I pre-ordered the single on amazon.co.uk for the 4 tracks, but when I received it, it was just a two track single (Jenny Wren and I want you to fly). Amazon refunded me, so I watched very carefully at this. I've waited till the release date (28 November), and still was with 4 tracks.A friend of mine bought it, and today... surprise! The fourth song is gone!Very, very disappointing!"
2,What Idiots!,"I ordered this title with the information posted on your site that ""Summer Of 59"" was on it making it a 4 track CDS! I get a three track single. adleast your sending a replacement but it BETTER be the 4 track version you discribed the first time!. Now I see you corrected the error & put up ""3"" tracks! You guys at Amazon better pay more attention & the single was fine except Amazons Blantant false advertising!Our mini site at: Judemac Forever"
5,Yummmyyyy,"I love fresh bread and Hodgson brand is awesome. i usually just use the dough cycle on my bread machine and then form the dough in buns and stickss so i can easily take them on to go. even if the brand is not organic all the ingredients are natural and processed without chemicals. but most of all they taste great. all it requires is some water and shortening(butter, or oil). i have even been able to use applesauce instead of oil but it didnt get as rich taste. I have ordered all varieties they had on amazon, whole wheat honey is specially tasty. no more supermarket bread!"
3,"good, tasty and easy bread","howdy y'all,this bread is pretty good. the potato flavor is there, recognizable as potato bread [if you've had it before] and not overwhelming. makes a good sandwich bread with meats or an enjoyably different pseudo-bruschetta base.made it with vegetable oil and olive oil. as usual, the good olive oil makes for a somewhat better flavor.rated a THREE cuz it's just exactly as expected - average with no surprises.take care,lee"
2,If you like gummy white bread . . . .,"White bread is not my thing, so that's probably why I don't like this one. I like herby white breads and really full-bodied white breads, but otherwise I always choose whole grains. This one is not full-bodied and has no particular flavor. Not interesting at all to me."
3,potato bread mix,I was a little disappointed...I first made the muffins with it and then let the bread machine make and bake a loaf - ok. Next I will try mixing it myself and baking in my oven. I do have to keep in mind though that potato bread is dense and heavier than say white bread. Convenient is a plus.
3,"Pretty good texture, but flavor is a bit blah.","This is a pretty good bread mix, but the texture of the bread is not quite right and the flavor is a bit blah. Since I had a box of 6, I tried different combinations of liquids and it still was never quite right. Used the recipe that came with the bread maker and happy to say that the potato bread from that recipe was much better in all ways. This may be good for a quick loaf, but I think there are better out there."
5,Great Bread,I recently tried this line of breads on vacation and loved the one we tried. I couldn't find the European Cheese & Herb flavor that we had locally so I went to order from Amazon.com. As happens from time to time the seller was out of that flavor so I picked up the Potato Bread instead and it was also very good. I still need to get the Cheese & Herb because that one was awesome.
2,Piate Vest with Skulls,"For the money it's okay for what I'm going to use them for. I purchased 30. The first thing I noiced is the skulls were already peeling off the vest so I am going to hot glue all 60 skulls on these vests as they are for an 1,100 employee pirate-themed event. Those wearing these vests will be dancing on stage and I can't have skulls flying off the vests."
4,learn to read your child's behavior,"It's very inetresting to lear how the children can comunicate with ourselves through crying, gestures, movements, etc. For an unexperienced father with my first child, was a great book which helped me recognize this language with my other 3 kids..."
3,Royal Affair by Laurie Paige,"I'm not a big fan of the ""royal baby - forced marriage"" plotline, but Laurie Page does as good a job with it as I've ever seen - it was an easy, pleasant read, perfect for the Doctor's waiting room or soccer practice ... recommend!Description from the book back cover:A handsome prince + a charming mother-to-be + tabloid gossip = and unforgettable marriage!One night of passion changed Ivy Crosby's life forever! While visiting the island of Lantanya, she met the man of her dreams. And after an evening of seduction and tenderness, she wound up pregnant -- and on the front page of the tabloids! Her sexy stranger turned out to be none other than playboy prince Maxwell von Husden. What was a girl to do?Max had to convince Ivy to be his bride. After all, she was carrying the heir to the throne, and he had a responsibility to his people. But once reunited with the beauty, he realized that his feelings had grown beyond duty, and for once, he'd opened his heart to love ...."
3,Good Albumn,"Not their best work but still worth a listen. If your looking to start of your Bad Religion collection, pick up Against the Grain"
2,I tried to like it...,"but this one just didn't do it for me. I heard a lot of good things about BR and I picked this CD up at random. Music should be interesting listening, but this album just seemed to contain several version of the same 2 or 3 songs. I listened to it a couple of times and then sold it. I just didn't care about the way they were trying to meld the music and lyrics together. Maybe I should've tried another BR album first, who knows. I'd rather spend money on classic punk rock like the Damned or the Clash or newer power pop masters like China Drum..."
2,The last Bad Religion album I ever bought.,"I can't really even remember what it sounded like. I just remember thinking, ""This sounds like they're trying pretty hard to sound different than they ususally do."" I like it when bands change and grow and evolve, but that wasn't the impression this album gave me. It seemed forced and contrived. Once in a while I'll hear a new BR song on the radio, and have no regrets that I'm no longer listening to them."
5,It's the generator,"What can be said about this CD that already hasn't been said? This is one of the greatest albums in (almost) recent punk history. From beginning to end, Bad Religion kicks serious ass on this album. I love every song more than the next and less than the one before it. As always, their lyrics are very political and directed at a treacherous government (ours), religious views (Christians), and trying to understand the meaning of life and answers to why we're here. Sounds like everything out today and everything before it, but Bad Religion makes it sound extremely f*cking awesome. Greg Graffin is one of the best vocalists out today as well as when this album was launched and his lyrics are very inspiring and motivating. This album should not be passed up by any means."
4,great experimental album,"definately their darkest album ever released on epitaph records. the song generator is amazing. i also love ""tomorrow"" and ""heaven is falling."" atomic garden is good, but overrated. this is the album where you can start to see a huge changeup from the previous. not only did they gain bobby as drummer, but the album is less and less of the straight forward punk agression found on suffer, no control and against the grain. the lyrics also take a stance on war and human condition instead of the whole scientific and anti-religion ways of the previous albums. this was defiantely to the gulf war of the early 90's as empire strikes first is to taking a stand on today's invasions of iraq.many people consider this the top bad religion album. i think its really good, but for me it is one of the middle ground ones. i may put it equal with stranger than fiction if im in a ""generator"" mood."
5,amazing,"I consider Generator to be the most underrated Bad Religion album to date. Although I can enjoy any cd they have realeased (inclunding Into the Unknown) in this bands span, I feel Generator is a standout album. the title track, generator, is just a beautiful song that I can personally relate to. It is just expresses Graffins chaotic confusion and his own personal struggle on wheter he believes in god or not. He tries to look at the situation scientifically, but their are little things in nature that cannot be explained logically. Lyrically, this album is flawless. It covers the topics that arise everyday, and many muscians don't have the balls to tackle. Musically, flawless as well.Standout tracks..GeneratorToo much to askTomorrowtwo babies in the darkheaven is fallingatomic garden"
2,Why the show was cancelled...,"Parallel Time, is the longest, most boring phase of DS. Now I understand why people raved about ""The Leviathans"". That was the end of quality. I love the show & have seen 800 episodes, but in truth the 1st year with Barnabas is the best. While this show excelled on witches, warlocks, ghosts & vampires, it really stank on Frankenstein, bride of Frankenstein, the wolfman, and in this phase, Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde. Jonathan Frid is often MIA in these episodes (understandably), & Angelique seems to be reprising her role from years earlier, without conviction. Selby/Quentin may have had roguish charm when he was introduced as a quasi-bad guy, but at this point he seems to be on Prozac & Valium. I'll watch the series 'til the end, but when I return to see DS again I'll stick to the first 7 collections."
3,In His Own Words,"The true value of this book is that it constitutes the man's life story in his own words. (John 7:51). Of course, given its publishing date of 1970 there is alot of time not covered by the book. The book cannot be regarded as an unbiased account by any means and might even be regarded as self-serving to some extent. Nonetheless any true scholar on the subject of Oral Roberts and his influence in the Christian/Charismatic world will want to hear from the man himself."
4,Not that great !,"Though it contains great songs, not all of them are good. Some are repetetive and boring. But still BR delivers classics so It's good to have this in your BR collection."
5,a good cd,"This Bad Religion cd is probably their best one yet. It has plenty of good songs including ""21st Century Digital Boy"" wich was released on alot of other cds of theirs. The best songs on here are modern man,digital boy, and anesthesia. If the only cds of theirs you have heard are generator and the gray race, then you're missing out and you need to get this cd"
4,i like it but...,"as far as i'm concerned, take 6 can do no wrong. but i have to admit that i don't like ""brothers"" as much as their others cd's. it has some good tracks,such as ""jesus makes me happy"" and ""can't stop thinking 'bout you"", but with this cd they sound like a hundred other r&b groups--good, but not unique. with there acappella works they are truly one in a million"
1,Sucks!,"I think Take 6 is an awesome group. Playing that Jazzy Acapella that is unique to these guys is a blessing. But on this one; ""Get thee behind me satan!"" C'mon guys what happened? My prayers are for better music from an outstanding 6."
2,Well...............?,"What can I say? It did not work. I have been and always will be a fan of Take 6 and of freedom of expression. But my motto is ""If it ain't broke, don't try and fix it"". This album was attempting to make a stronger mark on the charts. But what happend instead was total humiliation. The vocal harmonies, that set these 6 young men apart, were lost in the mediocre musical orchestrations. I was very disapointed when I listened to the album; I felt betrayed. Not even Brian McKnight, Claude's brother, could retrieve this lost cause. If you are a fan, this album will be one of those you say ""What were You Thinking""?"
2,Only for absolute beginners,This is only good for absolute beginners. The dancing is very bad at times.If you just want to learn some of the beginning principle steps of Salsatrio & a Cumbia backstep Rueda then it is okay.It is a very long video but some of dancers really need some lessons in timing & style.
5,Acceptable Sacrifice,"Going back to our first LOVE, the LOVE OF CHRIST, is always the best thing to do in times of distress. This little book will help you to remember your first LOVE! Anything that can help us regain our focus on JESUS CHRIST is worth looking at. Along with daily scripture reading, this book is an enhancement to the study of GOD'S WORD. Thanks...."
1,The Acceptable Sacrifice,This most excellent defense of God's common purpose for great trials and failings and His special love for and support of those who are broken hearted was a great comfort and help for me during a time of great personal difficulty. 5 stars
2,Get what you pay for,"I paid a totaly of $13.50 for these (including shipping). Without shipping they were about $7. that would be $3.50 a gun. Cheap right? They work just fine, and come with BBs. Perfect for someone just starting out. If you already own a gun get something alittle more exensive."
2,Very Noisy,"Jo and Milt aren't ""very noisy"" they're at their musical best. The CD is very noisy. There's a lot of surface noise on this CD and it overshadows the bass. Although the original vinyl disc may have been of audiophile quality this remastering isn't. There is no original art work, just adds for other Essential Media products. There are no track times, credits, liner notes or total playing time. Unless you're really interested in Pappa Jo give this a pass. Even then you might want to think again. $12.98 plus shipping is really expensive for this poor quality product."
4,Inchoate Nietzsche,"If you want to view the beginning of Nietzsche's philosophy, then this is the book to read. The rejection of accepted views of humankind, discovering the motive behind certain ways of being and thinking, are all coming into shape. However, his voice is not fully formed. His tiresome section on morals seems totally derivative/in response to Ree and other aphoristic writers about morals, in finding the motivations behind ""moral"" behavior.His ideas were fundamental in modern philosophy. Nietzsche's nihilism is consistently mis-interpreted. Now, people seem to settle for mis-interpretation of Nietzsche and existentialists as totally positivistic. In some sense, rejection of those previously absolute ideas affirm the material world, and human knowledge, continuously refuted by anti-materalist and theological tradition. There was and is a basis for future knowledge, a philosophy not divorced from existential reality."
2,Not what I expected.,"The book I received contained on 3 of 9 parts of Nietzsche's ""Human, All Too Human."" The translator is not identified in the book."
5,"Alas, All Too Human","""Where you see ideal types, I see what is human, alas, all too human,--I know man better"", writes Nietzsche. This book is a rejection of simplistic idealism and romanticism. Nietzsche comes into his own with this book, which is his first major philosophical work. The writing is not quite so strident as in his later texts, so this book will appeal to those who appreciate Nietzsche but sometimes wish for a toned down version of Zarathustra or The Anti-Christ. The book contains opinions an almost every subject under the Sun. If you never read this book, you will be shocked, amazed, and intrigued at Nietzsche's opinions on marriage, education, socialism, nationalism, public affairs, and the Church. This book will make you think, reevaluate received wisdom, and will, probably, make you want to read it again."
4,Very useful in the clinic,"I would recommend them for clinical use. I have two sets per clinic. Because of the price point, I typically recommend patients use a pillow at home."
4,Serita's Star Bright Quilt Review,"I purchased the Star Bright Quilt set for a gift and was very impressed when it arrived. The fabric is soft and the star design is beautifully made. Although it is not a very thick quilt, I believe it will do the job for moderately chilly nights.I bought it for my sister, who likes quilts and similar old Americana style items. She loved the gift and I plan to buy another one for myself."
3,Beautiful but flawed,"I received this quilt as a Christmas gift. At the time, I was delighted with it. It is attractive and seemed well-made. After six months of daily use and a number of washings (on gentle/cold) and hanging it to dry, I am sorry to report that the some of the stitching is coming loose and the red pieces bleed even in cold water. Despite this, I am still using it for now since it is comfortable and its appearance is still fairly acceptable. This quilt is beautiful but is perhaps better-suited to light use in the guestroom rather than the master bedroom."
5,awsome,i have always loved 7th heaven its the most intense non secular show iv ever seen and im only 14 and iv been watching this show since iv been old enough to comprehend it and this seson is worth buying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"Great fun, as always",Our family loves this series. It's a great way for them to see that we are not the only parents in the world setting the boundaries for them that we do. They also see they are not alone with the many challenges they face as they grow...and they see how to handle them with kindness and respect toward themselves and others. I recommend this series to all families!
3,Discussion of a series of Indian Wars,"This book's title tries to make it sound as if the scope of the book will be much grander than it is. The book discusses the early colonial conflicts with the Plains Indians by the French and Spanish but when discussing the Plains Wars most people I know consider the Plains Indian Wars to be an American affair, the results of U.S. expansion west of the Missouri River. The book bounces from fights in the southern plains (in Apacheria) and the northern plains (against the Souix and other aggressive tribes). The book does its best to look at the antagonists and their roles, as well as key figures in the conflict."
3,it is just Ok,I have read Freckles and A Girl of the Limberlost and I enjoyed both and so I hoped that this book would be good too. It started out just fine but somewhere in the middle it lost its way. The main character starts out as a young woman who knows what she wants but ends up with a husband who is clearly not right for her. She has many struggles after that as she lives with her decision.
2,Lacks charm of other Stratton-Porter work,"I did especially enjoy this book the way that I have enjoyed Stratton-Porter's other books. The main character was not very likeable. She did not seem to grow through her experiences. This book struck me as one that was written by someone who had grown cynical and hardened by disappointment when compared to the author's earlier work. I was charmed by the previous books of Stratton-Porter and, although, it was a different type of work...it was not a refreshing change."
1,The fil is great but this pack is not worth the price.,"Ok, the movie is GREAT, I love it, but this edition did not satisfy my. The dvds are just the same that were released previously, the film and the matrix revisited. No extras, no deleted scenes ( I believe there are none though :) ), no extra making of... Pay more than the lord of the rings - the fellowship of the ring, that even come with the statues, and 5 DVDs, 2 only for the movie, with great compression quality and dts sound. they could at least reencoded the film and removed the documentary from the movie dvd, saving space for better video quality, using more disc space. There are no other languages, but english, both for audio and subs. I regret payin 90 buck for a fake film frame, tha not even has dolby digital sound printed on it, like the Star wars episode 1 vhs special edition had. PLEASE buy the normal combo: the matrix and the matrix revisited, its the same thing for much less money."
1,Major disappointment!!!!!,"I bought this set for 13$, thinking I was getting a great deal for it. But no!!!!! This set is horrible.And the reason for it being horrible: It falls apart as soon as you open it.The glue that is meant to hold the plastic that has the Matrix Revisited disc on it and the tray which holds the movie and bonus stuff is really bad. In my case, came off the instant I opened the set up.But the senitype in this set is nice.Still, I would not recommend getting this set at all."
4,The Revolution,"The Matrix redefined the movies and has been copied to no end. Perfect in every sense: acting, story, depth and effects. Phylosophically deep to the point of spawning several books and essays on it's study. Ignore second and third parts."
2,Disappointing,So far I'm not impressed with the new Harlequin Flipside line. I read the first one and it was just ok. Nothing that I would recommend. This was worse. I couldn't tolerate the main character. I thought Matthew could do so much better. Hopefully the other books in the series are much better.
3,Not Quite Chick Lit,"I started this, then put it down, later picked it up for a day or so, then put it down. Somehow Corinne just didn't get me excited about her love life. There were some funny moments, so I won't entirely bad-mouth the book. It feels like a romance author trying to jazz up her book to fit the chick lit label.I go back to see if Kinsella has a new book out yet."
1,THE KENT CHRONICLES,"I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE DVD COPY OF ""THE KENT CHRONICLES"" AS OF THIS DATE (7 JANUARY 2013). I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GET THIS DVD."
5,Great series,I had read all of the Kent series books and I think that these movies followed the books pretty well. Some great acting also.
3,Really good beginning story,The Bastard was excellent but the Chronicles started to go down hill with the Rebela and totally died with the Seekers. The Seekers had a really terrible ending. This makes this whole part of the series not worth a second look.
3,Not as good as other GeoPuzzles,"This is our fifth GeoPuzzle - my son (3) LOVES them. For some reason, this puzzle is not the same quality as the others - the pieces are warped so the countries slide under one another, and the precision cutting around countries leaves something to be desired. Plus this puzzle is shaped so that most of the pieces are ocean, and as other reviewers have mentioned, the tabs fit into any hole making it very difficult to put together. Maybe it would have been better to have Mexico and Central Am as one puzzle and South Am as another? Regardless, my son has gone back to this puzzle a couple times but he just doesn't get the same excitement as he does with the other GeoPuzzles."
4,Great way to learn geography!,"My only complaint is that all the ocean/island pieces are shaped the same. So even if two pieces obviously don't go together, my son thinks that they do because they fit perfectly.Great invention, though! Love that the country pieces are shaped like the country."
4,Latin American Puzzle,The puzzle is not made to have a normal shape once put together but nonetheless I believe it will be effective in assisting my students to learn the names of Spanish-speaking countries and their capitals
4,highly recommended with adult supervision,"We actually are going to give this to my 3 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas. She has the North American one and it's been a WONDERFUL educational tool. Each state (except a few of the small New England area states) are a separate piece. It has really helped her to learn the location and name of every state, the corresponding capital and even the provinces in Canada. She is learning the bodies of water now. The pieces are only as durable as a regular jigsaw puzzle though. So, you have to watch if they stick them in their mouths or spill milk on them. We have a few ""frayed"" pieces."
5,Hauntingly Beautiful,"Zbigniew Preisner is one of the best composers of the century. He has composed music for many European movies, as well as some orchestral and vocal works such as In Silence, Night, and Dreams and Requiem for a Friend. His music is hauntingly beautiful and expressive beyond measure. At times, his music has the gentle and soothing quality of James Newton Howard, and other times its complexity is beyond words. I highly recommend this soundtrack as well as his other works."
4,Great way to relax,"I like this DVD for relaxing or using as background while I work at my computer. The music is very soothing for background and if I should relax in a lounge chair, the visuals are so soothing that I go to sleep easily.This is my first DVD from Medwyn Goodall and I do plan to purchase another as a gift to a our daughter-in-law who just gave birth to her second son yesterday...."
4,Beautiful Music!,"I enjoy all of Medwyn Goodall's music, so am always in the market for his new experiences. The scenery was outstanding; and although I assumed most of it had been photographed in England, there were several scenes that I felt were not photographed there. I am interested in travelogues that tell me just where I am travelling in my arm chair. So my only disappointment is that there was no mention of where the scenes were actually photographed."
1,not what I thought!,"There was only two songs on this whole cd that were any good at all. When I listened to the samples they werepretty decent but now I wish I had not purchased it. Guess I'm just not ""in that groove"". Like more contemp songswith some message and some beat."
5,Excellent introduction to classical music,"This CD uses very funny conversations between Elmo, Big Bird and the Birdapest symphony orchestra to introduce famous classical tunes. My 3 year old loves the conversations; my 7 year old can now hum all these classical tunes and know which composer wrote them. The conversations ask the kids to imagine certain things according to the tunes, so they can appreciate the music a whole lot more. My 7 year old actually asks for classical radio stations in the car! I think it's a masterpiece, to introduce classical music in a fun and interactive way to kids."
3,needs more,"This is one of the weaker Bad Religion albums, and it is strange that it was their breakout album. The lyrics are incredible, but listening to it, I wished that the instrumentation was tighter. There are times on the album when Gurewitz can't seem to find the riff he is looking for, and it becomes distracting. The highlights on the album include the title track, Portrait of Authority, and American Jesus, which is good, but highly overrated. If you want a far surperior BR album check out either No Control or Suffer, and then All Ages, a compilation of their best songs produced while they were with indie mega-label Epitaph."
5,Simply the best,"This may not be the strongest Bad Religion album all around, that award goes to Suffer, but Recipe for Hate has lots of very good songs, including their all time best song, American Jesus. It doesn't get any better than this."
3,Recipe for almost hating this cd,"I love the song Recipe For Hate but after that the album nose dives. Kerosene is weird/funny, not really a bad song but the rest of the cd sucks. Bad Religion is one of my favorite bands but I have found that most of their songs are duds but then others are freakin awesome. I think the most consistently good album by them is Suffer."
2,Don't Read This,"After reading all of the other reviews posted, I,m going going to have to disagree with pretty much all of them. This albumn lacks emotion. Sure there are a few good tracks lick Recipe for Hate and American Jesus, but the rest of the albumn sounds like cuts they recorded just to fill up space. I can't listen to it. Yeah the lyrics are politically concious but aren't all BR's albumns? My suggestion is to pick up Against the Grain."
2,Not the greatest Bad Religion album,"This is a little disappointing for BR. The album layers on WAY too many harmonies and the production is kind of sluggish. Not as bad as most of their 90s output (The ""Stranger Than Fiction"" CD notwithstanding), but this can't touch earlier albums like ""Suffer"", ""80-85"" and ""No Control"". I will say ""American Jesus"" is a classic BR song, however. If you want a good primer to their Epitaph Records years check out ""All Ages""."
4,Bad Religion at their finest,"Although I am not a fan of Punk Rock, I find Bad Religion to be great since once in a while they will release a song/political statement that is really clever and well presented. Recipe for Hate is not their best release musically (for that I would recommend ""No Substance""), but lyrically there are several tracks that really appeal to me. Portrait of Authority and Skyscraper are two tracks that really got me hooked to Bad Religion. Although I do not agree with all of Bad Religions statements and opinions(actually, I disagree with most of them), I am glad that they go on stating them."
5,Intelligent old school punk rock,"The most diverse Bad Religion album, ""Recipe for Hate"" builds on the political themes of all Bad Religion albums with a more textured delivery. The sing-a-longs on this album appeal to more than just the typical hyperactive punk enthusiast. Songs like ""Man with a Mission"" will stand the test of time as a truly unique voice in the ever evolving genre of punk rock. ""Recipe for Hate"" has no peers."
5,One of BR best CDs,"This is one of the best BR CDs. American Jesus being the Best BR song ever written. This was the first BR CD I ever heard and that was it I was hooked. BR has the most song out of any band that actually have content in the words, not just rambling about money or violence or the women the they have slept with. It is very unfortunate that the Radio stations don't give them more play."
3,i don't see much good about this album...,"It's not really too much of a commercial copout, yet the songwriting is down on all levels and there are very few standouts. Boring is the term. Nearly every track is identical, and played at mid tempo. Alot of BR fans say this is among their favorites, but I can seriously not find anything to rave about.American Jesus, Don't Pray On Me, and the title track are the only songs I could get into. Get No Control or Suffer instead"
4,Melodic and Relevant,"I am not much into punk. But, if there ever was an institution in punk, it would be Bad Religion. Their music is incredibly powerful and melodic, but not ""poppy"" melodic a'la Green Day. Their melodies are more ominous, a bit dark. The lyrics are obviously very important for them, too. Their music, being punk, is not virtuoso music, and that is just the point. Simple, like a punch in the face, and the effect is exhilarating. I have this one cd of them only, although I've heard others. But, like I said, I am not heavily into punk. I love the Sex Pistols,The Ramones, Fugazi, Descendants, Pennywise, Black Flag, and a bit of Green Day, but that's about it. Bad Religion is an institution in punk, because they've been very consistent and they've been around a long time, and always true to their vision. Punk was never dead. Just ask Bad Religion."
3,VERY GOOD,"Fast, melodic, great lyrics. What more to wish ? I only think that fourtenn songs in 37 minutes is toomuch, they began to sound a little bit repetitive and boring along the middle."
4,Great album,"I would say this is my favorite BR album as a whole but I can't. It has some of my favorite songs on it (American Jesus, Looking In, My Poor Friend Me, etc) but I dont listen to the entire album so it as a whole isnt their best. I don't like Keroscene at all, and that's the only BR song I dont enjoy. But still, even with a few songs I skip, the cd is great. I listen to it all the time."
5,Bad Religion: Recipe for Hate,"this was my first Bad Religion album, I was still new to being exposed to the riotous sound of punk. When I listed to this album in its entirety I instantly fell in love from Bad Religion's tasty fast paced songs (witch take up most of the album) to their slow, deep, meaningful tracks, this album is truly all killer no filler. I recommended Bad Religion's Recipe for Hate for anyone who is a fan of the old, new, or hardcore punk."
2,I dont know...,I dont know if it is my face or its just the product... my face is still oily after using this for almost a month now... not worth the money... it makes you feel refreshed though after using it. :(
3,"Its a good product, just not for me","Ok so I read the reviews for this product and thought finally something to help my oily skin and let me say I have very oily skin. I tried it and was not impressed at all, my skin felt very fresh and clean after I washed it and I love the texture of the product but it just didn't help me with my oil problem at all. Skin care products don't work the same for everyone so it is just something you have to try and see if it works. I like Neutrogena a lot and I still think this is worth trying. If you are looking for something I recommend Olay Pore Minimizing facial scrub it is swirled in a little bottle but I found it works great with my skin type."
2,"Well, my face doesn't get oily at least","I have been using this since i love the gel. Anyway, my skin has actually gotten worse. SO, I am going to continue using it and see if it is a ""gets worse before it gets better"" kinda thing. However, it has been two weeks and it is pretty bad. If my skin dramatically clears up by the time I finish this bottle, I will write an amazing review. Until then, my pimples hurt."
3,"I like it, but clinique works better!","I been using Clinique for many year and my acne got match better, after trying neutrogena for 3 months I don't see any diffrents,its not bad,but I don's see any diffrents and I tryed all neutrogena product."
3,"My husband called these ""healthy brownies""","These brownies bake up very nicely. I would call their consistency ""cake like"". However my husband called them Healthy Brownies. He said he could taste the flax seed. I tend to agree. In my opinion, if I'm going to eat chocolate, I don't want it to have that ""healthy"" taste. On the other hand I love the Blueberry Muffins that Hodgson Mill makes."
5,Needs a few additions,"Add walnuts to this healthful Brownie and perhaps a light iceing. Do not overback or it will be very dry. Lots of good stuff in this Brownie, but the flax taste is a little strong. I really feel no guilt when having a Brownie snack for me or my kids."
5,These are grrrrrrrreat!,"Of course they don't taste quite as good as ""regular"" brownies but hello? That's because they're healthy! And that being said, they are FANTASTIC! Why eat crap when there are such good alternatives!?"
3,Grainy Brownies,"I like that this item has flax seed in it but the whole wheat flower makes it very grainy. It is also very oily even after you cook it. If you do not mind gritty brownies then get this product. Also, they are not very chocolately so I added chocolate chips to the recepie. It makes it have more fat and calories but they taste better this way."
5,"Flax, whole grain and chocolate mix","Three super foods in a great chewy brownie recipe. Also, can add zucchini or finely grated carrot before cooking to improve the nutrition without adversely affecting the texture."
4,Soulful Stuff!,"For a first novel, it was quite a read. Honest, emotional, and riveting! I couldn't stop reading it. If you are looking for an excellent read for the summer, try this out.A note: the novel is obviously self-published/edited, so expect a few hiccups, Otherwise, excellent."
1,Too small for my bikes,The product description and product photo are for the 3.5 mm red wrench. The product name says it is the black wrench.The black wrench that I received does not fit any of the Trek or Specialized bikes my family has. This wrench is too small.
2,A Bitter Pill,"I have to say that I really wanted to like these muffins, but I could not. They have a really bitter after taste. Whether this is attributable to the gluten free nature of the product, I do not know. The Hodgson Mill Blueberry Muffin Mix is a far better choice. On a positive note, they do raise very nicely, but it is unfortunate that I find them barely edible and have five more boxes of the mix left."
5,Really good muffins!,I baked my first batch of these muffins and was pleased that they were so easy to make and tasted so good. Then I stored them in the refrigerator since gluten free home baked goods are notorious for molding. I ate one straight out of the frig and it was great! I guess the flavors melded together after being stored a few hours. I finished the batch one at a time out of the frig without re-heating any of them. They were so good that way I couldn't bring myself to try them any other way. :)Our family has been navigating the area of gluten free eating for over 10 years. The choices just keep getting better as more companies are becoming aware of celiac disease. I have created an astore through Amazon that has the gluten free items we have had the pleasure of trying. [...]
2,Bitter and a disappointment,I bought these at my local grocery store. I wish I would have read the review on here first. The positive is they do hold together well and look like a muffin. The negative is they are so bitter. I could barely finish my half. I just recently found out I have Celiac Disease so I cant have gluten. I have never tried a gluten free muffin mix before so I can not compare it to any others. I have tried the Betty Crocker Gluten Free brownie mix and that is wonderful. So I do believe there would be a good muffin mix out there.
1,Nasty,"If I could, I would give it zero stars. I am not a picky eater, but this mix did not rise (can you say hockey puck), was extremely bitter, and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added. Save your money."
2,Probably would be better to make something like this from scratch,"I concur with previous reviewers in that these muffins have such a bitter taste! I also bake often and I'm certain it wasn't me. My gluten-eating husband didn't like them either. They were also dense.If you are looking for an apple cinnamon flavor and need a mix, you might be better off using Pamela's Baking Mix (which is awesome!) and adding apples and cinnamon to it. The muffin recipe is on the back of the Pamela bag.In conclusion, I don't recommend these; they were really disappointing."
3,"a little more ink, please","Great book except that whoever prepared the photo files for printing made them rather washed out, a bit disappointing for a book about images."
1,Waste of money,fdisk : it says linux comes with a non destructive partitioning utilitylilo : completely unclear about the different error messages.mbr : says each disk partition will have an MBRchapters on installation is useless.Overall Barkakati book is hundred times useful.Shame that I didn t know before spending money.
1,This book is terrible,"This book is full of mistakes and very unclear.Here's an example.. When he introduces the POP protocol, he tells the reader that it stands for Point of Presence as opposed to Post Office Protocol, come on now. I was looking for a book to help prepare me for the RHCE, but now, I don't trust any information that comes from this book, and I would not recommend it to anyone who is even the slightest bit unfamiliar with Linux or UNIX.Since I have worked with Linux systems, I can tell the mistakes, and there are many. It is a waste to even try to get something out of this book. I have since purchased another book, so let's see how that one does."
1,RHCE - It is a waste,"Please save your money.....the test questions are elementary (and the answers sometimes wrong) and the text is inconsistent. On one page, it states that a Server installation requires 2.1 GB, on another 2.4 GB, and then somewhere else, it places the figure at 1.9 GB. Which is it? I don't think I'll ever find out from this book."
4,A good book for an administrator - new and experienced,"True, maybe some of the answers are wrong (and with the Red Hat 7.2, a little dated too), plus some of the installation are probably more of the matter of opinion. However book gives you an overall view of the Red Hat distribution - its structure, it's operation and specific features that distingushed itself from other distributions and/or OSes. Although it will *NOT* teach you have to use UNIX in general (those without a UNIX background should get the RHCE Red Hat Certified Engineer Study Guide by Sybex - or even better, the Teach Yourself UNIX in 24 hours book by SAMS), it is understandable enough that it will get your started with the operating system. This book actually helped me a bit, particular with server rescues. Overall, as a companion book, I would recommend it. Otherwise, I would also buy the books I mentioned, plus a good shell and/or Perl book to round out your library."
5,Great value,"Well written and packed with useful info. I'm a Delphi programmer (trying to learn C# using VS) and this is my first VS 2005 book. You get a lot for your money with this book and the author's writing style is clear, concise and often entertaining. I highly recommend it."
2,Slow delivery,"It took a couple of weeks to get this. Book was in good shape when I received it, but delivery was too slow."
3,Yoga for a flexible life,I thought this was a music cd when I ordered it (should have taken more time to read the description) but the DVD did not disappoint.
5,Feels like Love,I love Maya's yoga videos. I now have every single one. This set is my favorite. I love the consistent format of all of them. Some are harder than others. These two are fairly easy but also extremely soothing and uplifting.
3,Too much of a good thing,"I have most of Maya's DVD. This has elements of her Detox and Destress (the best ever). Perhaps if you didn't have more than two of her DVD's this wouldn't be an overkill. She's in the same outfits, same setting and same music. The quality is not as good as the detox video. Choppier and sloppier. However, it is an effective routine."
4,Good Up-tempo punk style recording,"This is a solid and fast-paced collection. ""The Bag"" and ""She's Gone"" are best on the cd. I think ""Punk in Drublic"" cd is a better one to have, but this is one I listen to every few weeks and enjoy. NOFX seems to have their own sound and ""White Trash..."" seems to represent this in every cut."
5,White Trash Two Heebs and A Bean.,"NOFX is one of the greatest Punk Bands on Earth, You have to search through this Album to find the best songs.""I wanna be your baby"" is a super high energy track that will blow anyone away it is pure Punk for Skaters and Surfers.""You're Bleeding"" is a good Song about ""Beautiful Girls"".It is a really good Punk Album, but its been out for years."
4,4.5 STARS,"This CD would be perfect if it didn't have the songs ""Buggley Eyes"", and ""Straight Edge""(a cover of a Minor Threat song, cool punk band) The other songs are all great. This is the first NOFX CD with El Hefe, and you can deffinately here a difference in how the music sounds, it's so much better. It has some nice ska songs like Johny Appleseed, and some great punk songs like Stickin In My Eye. Here's how I would grade every song:(1)Soul Doubt: A...(2)Stickin In My Eye:A...(3)Bob:A...(4)You're Bleeding:B...(5)Straight Edge:C...(6)Liza And Louise:A...(7) The Bag:A...(8)PPTSOTR:A...(9)Warm:A...(10)I Wanna Be Your Baby:A...(11)Johny Appleseed:A...(12)She's Gone:A....(13)Buggley Eyes:CGreat CD!!! GO BUY IT!!!"
1,isn't that great,"this cd isn't all that great. Songs like bob and stickin in my eye aren't that great. The older nofx is alot better than there new stuff. Liberal animation, and maxnium rocknroll are the best, but this one and there newest ones aren't all that good. Get the real older nofx cd's for some real nofx punk, then if you really like nofx get there this one, and there other ones."
4,Great album,"NOFX are just funny. This is a really solid punk album. I first heard bob and a Punk compilation I have. I really liked it, so i found out about the album it was on and got it. It's really good. The only let down is Straight Edge, cause I'm not a big cover song fan. It's unique though. Jonny Appleseed is a cool song. I recommend this to anyone"
3,REAL PUNK ROCK? TRY SIMPLE PLAN INSTEAD,THESE GUYS SUCK AND THEY ARE NOT PUNK.....SIMPLE PLAN IS PUNK AND SO I GOOD CHARLOTTE SO SCREW NOFX......AND REPUBLICANS RULE
5,best work,this is their best work even though they had other good ones this is just flawless with not one bad song in my opiniongo buy
5,must-have book for those studying digital communications,"For those students who plan to digest concepts in digital communications, try this book first before touching other texts. Very well-written, concise, covers many important topics (WAY CHEAPER AT ANOTHER ONLINE BOOKSTORE!!!)"
2,"Nothing new here, alas","I wouldn't say it's BAD, but it'll be a bit too familiar if you've read his other work. He even uses stuff from Class. Like the above reviewer, I too, found a good deal of his information and commentary fishy. Here's one more example: I've seen countless postal workers drinking in uniform in NYC and NJ bars ---Fussel claims they are prevented from doing so. Did he never see Cheers? Be nice if he returned to literary criticism."
5,"An intresting read for my teenage sons, the free thinkers....","I have senior and sophomore boys in high school (who are also in boy scouts, one is an eagle scout) and it was interesting for them to see how folks in uniform are looked upon and ""classified"" (the younger one wants to go into the Navy before college).Interesting topic for the dinner table."
1,Waste of Time,"Mr. Fussell has written one book too many. This is a stream of thought on the subject. If ever there was an opportunity to illustrate, it was missed here. At less than 200 pages, he was obviously in a hurry. One wonders, why he even started. I heard an interview with him on NPR and it was interesting. Perhaps, Mr. Fussell should consider selling the tape."
5,Stephen White hits his target again,"I am a big fan of White and love his books--every one. And this was not a disappointment. It was great to have Alan Gregory back again. And all those secrets? Wow------who knew?The humor is fun and witty. The story keeps you guessing and waiting to see what was going to happen next. A true page turner with surprises at almost every turn.And the ending-----I won't give it away----but could lead to another sequel and continuing story with the characters we love in this one: Alan, Sam, Lauren just to name a few.Sit back and enjoy this one---it's a fun read."
3,dry reading,This latest Dr. Alan Gregory novel was not one of Stephen White's better books. I found it slow moving and very predictable. It was easy to put it down and come back days later to read more. Save your money for the paperback edition.
2,Well done!,"I loved it. A bit confusing with all of the names but well done. Stephen White is not kind to the reader, I appreciate this. He kills off beloved characters, not just the homeless and unconnected. He gives the reader a chance to grieve along with his characters.Well done."
1,Boring & Highly Unbelievable,This book was a waste of my time & money. Characters kept being introduced at random throughtout the read. They were there only to explain the unexplainable and boring plot. I was really turned off by this book. A high school sophmore could have penned something better.
2,WHAT?,I am a fan of stephen white but I got lost in the middle of the story and never found my way back. Someone please tell me what this book was about.
3,Secrets,"Every character in this book has a secret, secrets they can't talk about for a variety of personal reasons even if their lives and careers are threatened. Since Gregory can't talk to his prosecutor wife and the cops about his secret, he has turned from psychiatrist to detective to out manuever a killer who is after revenge and seeks to destroy him and his family. His wife also has work-related and personal secrets she keeps from him. Their best friend, a cop, also has to compartmentalize their friendship. At times the book becomes exasperating since a simple explanation could serve to make life simpler."
2,Dry Ice,I've read all the books in this series and this is the second book that is really not good. The premise of the book is good but out of 500 pages about 250 are about the angst of Alan Gregory...move on...get a life. I used to enjoy these but no more. I'm hoping that with The Siego and Sam Purdy we get back to a better book.
4,A Cut Above His Other Books,"I loved White's first book, ""Privileged Information"" and bought the whole Alan Gregory series, much to my disappointment. The subsequent books were average, at best. Finally, along comes ""Dry Ice"" and I think it's a cut above his other books. Too bad I had to wade through the others to get here. And, although it's better than his other books, it's not MUCH better. All of White's faults are here: Far too much psychological insight and babbling, too many coincidental plot turns, too many unbelieveable happenings, etc. In all honesty, I enjoyed the book. It kept me rapt and was hard to put down -- at least most of the time. White's a good writer -- he just never seems to hit a home run, in my estimation."
5,Should be part of every teacher's library...,"Carol Ann Tomlinson's book shows teachers how to meet the needs of the wide range of abilities found in most classrooms through effective instructional grouping strategies. Differentiating curriculum is one of the most, if not the most, important skills for teachers to master in order to help all kids reach their full potential. Ms. Tomilson's techniques show teachers how to reach all levels of students - from those needing remediation - to the more advanced learner who needs a faster pace, more independence, and a more in- depth curriculum to thrive. Practical and clearly written... highly recommended."
5,diffetrntited instruction book by tomlinson.,Quick and easy read! Really inspires you to get living and offers many good examples as to how to employ DI in the classroom.
5,A Great Book,I am a college student majoring in education and read this book for a class. I thought it was a great book. I would have read it even if it was not for a class. Carol Ann Tomlinson put a lot of usefull information about differentiating the classroom in this book. She gave many wonderful examples. It was also an easy book to read and easy to understand. I recommend anyone who is a teacher or who is going to be a teacher to read this book.
4,Good information. Summarizes and tells about the characters.,"Great book. Tells about the characters ,people who play them, plans for the future, and much more. Keeps tabs on what hapens and has great qoutes and facts. Only, its a little too picky."
4,For the X-Files fanatic,"A thoroughly well researched book. I found a few of the nit-picks a bit too trivial for my liking, but on the whole I found this book to be well worth the reading time.One inaccuracy I did find was when the author mentioned that a computer can't turn itself on when the phone rings (this happened to Scully in ""Ghost In The Machine""). I guess he's never heard of a PC with wake-on-ring."
2,Skip It!,"While I don't like to trash another musician's work, I must say in all honesty that this CD is neither worth the $16 or the two to three week wait. In hindsight, I wished I had heeded the warnings of ""raw analog recordings"" and ""never before released tracks,"" Generally, those are code words for noisy, inconsistent and otherwise poor sound quality not otherwise suitable for release. In some instances, the quality of this CD is lower than some bootlegs. This CD fits the rule that if the songs are good enough to be released they would have been, long ago. The crowd's chatter and idle conversation during the performance are very audible and distracting. Moreover, the sound quality varies from track to track due in part to the fact that the CD picks up songs recorded at different times and in different places. Jim Bott, apparently needing a buck, lists his telephone number on the back as 1-800-BUY-MY-CD. I gave him $16. Don't make the same mistake."
5,An excellent book on Tkinter,"John Grayson has filled a great void in the Python community with this book. The online Tkinter docs are good start, but if you need hints, tips, real code examples that you can download (and there is a ton of it), this is the book. There is a lot of code in this book, and John explains the code section by section in the examples. There are quite a few good Python segments such as optimizing Python, writing extensions, and debugging, but mostly it is as the title states, Python AND Tkinter. I enjoyed seeing John emphasize the importance of well written Python code, and how to do this. Great book."
2,Not Enough about Tk,"I have programmed several commercial Macintosh and Windows applications and I have become fairly proficient with Python, so I figured that writing GUIs with Tkinter would be pretty straightforward and Grayson's book looked like a great place to start.Not so. While it's fine to have lots of code samples, what would have been even better was much more nitty-gritty discussion of Tk itself. Tk is very clever and powerful, but it is not straightforward. This is even more true of Megawidgets, upon which Pmw is based, and which is widely used in Grayson's examples.The appendices at the end are great if you know exactly what you are looking up but frustrating if you don't have a good overview of how Tk works. I recommend Effective Tcl/Tk Programming by Harrison and McLennan to fill in some of the many gaps in Grayson."
2,Not for the timid,"It is a great book for doing the most simple ofGUI tasks and for a reference once you have been usingTkinter for an extended period of time. The book leaves outkey definitions when they are most needed, isn't organizedwell and generally falls short when you really start gettinginterested. Don't get this book if you are trying translateother GUI skills to Tkinter. It is good for learning theabsolute basics and as a reference."
2,"Lots of info, poorly presented!","I find that the author is out of touch with how to present material. He's already tackling a 'calculator' application by page 22. Quite a jump! He should have consulted with someone more experienced in material presentation for someone learning and/or trying to tie concepts together.By starting with basics in the early going, it would have made understanding a little easier in the more complex examples."
3,"Decent Book, Horrible Code Examples","The book is fairly good, though not as explicit as I'd like in some places. But I am extremely frustrated with the code examples that I downloaded from the company's web page. Many of them don't run, complaining about either modules it cannot import or even worse, attributes that don't exist. For a real laugh, check out Chapter06/phone.py. This file isn't even runnable python code, it's an email with python code embedded in it. Does anyone check these examples before putting them on the web page? I'd like to give this book 4 stars, but I can't justify it until ALL the examples work as advertised. Instead I'll give it 3 for a good try."
1,Not for the beginner,"As a complete novice GUI programmer (but with some Python experience) I found this book to be essentially useless. The beginning examples use classes for which there is no explanation, and it only gets worse. The book does not proceed in any organized manner. After hours of floundering, I have decided to abandon Tkinter programming until a better book comes out."
1,"Badly written book, badly written examples","This is the only book on the subject. Thus, if you want to make Tkinter interfaces, you have to buy it. The book is unfortunatly, awful. It is disorganised, it glosses over important points, the code examples are poor (either there isn't enough of them to actually run, or they are so long as to be silly.), and many things just aren't explained. Mr. Grayson, unfortunatly wants to spend more time quoting Monty Python, then teaching Tkinter in any sort of step by step manner. (a side note, after flipping pages for hours in a vain attempt to find information in this book, Monty Python quotes are not very funny anymore.) While Python is easier than Java, Java Swing with a good IDE (like JBulilder or Forte) is easier than Python Tkinter. This book sets Python's future and usefulness back a few steps."
3,Patchy but has good tricks for advanced programmers,"This is no place to start and it's by no means a reference because for example it leaves out essential information on the text widget.if you are looking for a good reference just type Tkinter reference in Google and take the first result. That is a far better reference.Still this book has a lot of clever code that you could take as inspiration, so it's worth having if you plan to use TkInter.Please be aware that there are really serious alternatives to TkInter: WxPython and PyQt (both are free, well documented and very powerful).You might like TkInter because it comes with Python by default, and because it has such a powerful text widget for example, but please consideryour choice carefully before embarking on months of programming."
3,Not for beginners,"This book jumps in with examples full of concepts that are not explained (until perhaps later) and when I tried to make one run it didnt even ""compile"" (with Python 2.0). Still, it's useful to have a reference there. There is an introduction on the net by Fredrik Lundh that is more accessible. Still you may be inspired by the compactness of Grayson's examples."
5,Gift for mom,A series loved by my mom and purchased at a great price. Plan to purchase all seasins for her
3,"great show, cheap packaging","I love this show, can't say enough good things about it. The review I wanted though, was how the packaging was! So here it is. The show itself gets 5 stars, 2 thumbs up and a big smile from me.The packaging needs improvement. It's thin, and one of my cases has already broken. I was hoping for a quality case so my new disc's don't get messed up but I guess I'll have to go buy those myself.The outside cover is beautiful. It comes in a box, which is a decent sized thickness, and the insert booklet is beautifully done. Then you get to the rather thin plastic, which flips on hinges to reveal the 6 discs. The hinge is the biggest problem, because your sleeves come out of it. The dvd's themselves are wonderful, not a problem with any of them -- and yes, I checked every single disc before I would review.So, excellent show, great dvd's, needs new packaging."
3,It's okay,"too mushieie, too much nudity, too much talking, not enough bikes. Not enough talking about global warming. where is the oil??"
3,I think V.C. Andrews wrote better books when she was alive.,"The old V.C. Andrews books (My Sweet Audrina,Casteel Series,and the Flowers in the Atti c series) were the best ones. I didn't like it how Olivia was so cruel to Samual. She continued to be rude to him. I couldn't see how she could have such a cold heart. Sometimes she could be very nice and then other times she could snap. I excpected more from v.c. Andrews. I still liked some parts of the book, but most was pretty dull."
2,Predictable!,"There hasn't been a good quality V.C. Andrews book since she died, WOW! Imagine that! But, who'd expect a dead woman to come with an original storyline? I don't really know why I keep reading them. Why doesn't Mr. Ghostwriter, write his OWN books under his OWN name. Let the poor woman die."
5,Awesome,"I think all of the books are great but there needs to be more of them , these are the only books I read and I have to wait so long before they come out, please write them faster."
2,A Very Big Disappointment,"Okay, I waited, like a whole year for this book to come out. I thought that once it came out, you would find out everything, all the secrets Melody was looking for, all the good stuff. So I bought it and for what? Some cold, impractical witch who won't sleep with her own husband, hell they have seperate bedrooms and she keeps it locked all the time, but wants to sleep with some guy whom she had a chance to be wiht but blew it. The least they could have done was describe Hallie, Kenneth, Jacob, and Chester's childhood. The only thing that would make up for the Logan series would be having a book about Hallie, or even Chester. Hey they need a book narrated from a guy, not jsut a girl."
3,Some what ok.,This book could've been better in keeping me more up to speed. It kinda carried on a little to much but at least I know why Olivia was such a witch.
3,Keep on coming,"Wonderful to read this book finally. Olivia,as a young woman, was everything I knew she would be. Thanks"
4,The Old V.C. Andrew's is back!,"This book was more of the V.C. Andrews I remember. I have been a fan of V.C. Andrews for almost 20 years and have collected each of her books. After reading her last series I was considering not buying another one of her novels. ""Olivia"" has changed my mind and I will still consider myself a fan if the writers keep up with this caliber of writing."
2,Olivia not justified,Usually these books in the series try to justify the so called 'bad' person in previous stories. Most of the time I end up understanding the 'evil' characters bitterness. But not in this case. Olivia was bitter and cold in the beginning. And she stayed that way from begining to end. I give her no reason for doing the wicked things in her later life. What a WITCH! I would've rather have seen a book about Haille.
2,Too late in coming and not exciting when it got here.,It is already hard enough to wait through four novels before you get to find out what happened in the very begining but to have to wait through a whole other series is pathetic. I completely forgot about the Logan series and it wasn't until I was already reading the book that I realized that this one was a follow up. It was really hard to enjoy because as time goes on and you've read more series containing more characters you forget all of the details you need to know to understand what is going on in this book. You can imagine the surprise when after thinking that this was a new series that it turned out to be end of an old series. I wouldn't recommend releasing a new series then releasing an end to an old one. Like most people who have read the new ghost written VC Andrews novels I think they all have the same basic plot with different character names and wording. Please try something different or let Ms. Andrews rest in peace.
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I started reading VC Andrews books when I was in high school. I was totally facinated with the style of writing that she used in her books, but the series that have come out after the Casteel series seem to be stuck in one pattern and are too predictable. If you look at the plots between the Heaven series, My Sweet Audrina, and the Flowers in the Attic Series, They are completely different, and the last book in the series always answered all the question you had plus a few you didn't think of! The ghostwriter needs to get some new ideas or stop writing all together!"
4,ALRIGHTY.....,"Okay, she ALWAYS has great books, and this series was great, but ARE THEY GOING TO STOP IT? THEY CAN'T! NO! NO! NO! NO!!!!"
3,"Too much sex, but as icy as I knew she would be.",Waited a long time for this one. I didn't expect Olivia to be so open-minded about sex. She seemed so holier than thou in the other books. Kinda disapointing after that long of a wait. Olivia could have been a little more in depth.
3,It was O.K.,"This was a long awaited book! I was surprised however with the modern talk in it, usually V.C. Andrews books are written to the 1940 era~! They made Belinda seem to be this horrible disgusting ..., and Olivia to be mean. I this this ghost- writer is trying hard to fill in for Andrews, but the books just arent as captivating as they used to be! I find i am finished with the book, and feel like i was expecting more~! My favorite books were the Flowers in the Attic series. Im not saying to copy that, but i like that plot line the best, everything else since then has been the same plot with different wording. Maybe try a new Idea rather than changing the words of what she has already written!"
4,Couldn't put it down.,"This book, Olivia, was OUTSTANDING! I could not put this book down. Even at my school during lunch I would sit and read it. It is wonderfully written and leaves many questions to ponder such as: How far will someone go to save their family? Not only does this book chill you to the bone but it makes you feel as if you are Olivia. I found myself saying things to the other characters in to book. This book has moments that make you want to cry, and moments that chill you to the bone. It is very confusing at first but if you keep an open mind you will understand it.My only mistake was I read this book first in the Logan's series."
1,I wish V.C. Andrews was still alive!,"The author that took over for V.C. Andrews has totally lost the V.C. Andrews style and technique as far as her writing went. I found Olivia boring and hard to stay with. For the most part, I thought the series was too broken up, with the telling of Melody, Laura, and now Olivia... I hope the new author sees this and gets w/ the program! As far as the Runaway seriesand the new Misty book - get a life whats w/ the 149 page books? Plus you get to read the Prolog to the next book, which after your finished w/ that, you've about read half of the next book!!! I have read everything V.C. Andrews has ever written and since her death - the person taking over has done her wrong!!!!!!!! Thank you for listening - Sandi"
4,Pulls much of the Logan story together,I really enjoyed this book. I really felt sorry for Olivia and understood where she was coming from after reading this book. I would still like to see another book about Haille growing up.
5,Perfect,"This holds the sacred title of ""Perfect Game"" in my mind. This is not an honor bestowed lightly; less than five have it.It is a very original blend of action and strategy, with elements of flight simulation (although you can't quite fly) and even mech combat. It is science fiction, but not overblown and unbelieveable.Not only was this an amazing game when it came out (it was a contemporary of Thief: The Dark Project, Half-Life, and Rainbow Six), but it is still just as amazing when you pick it up today. The graphics, while slightly outdated, are not so outdated that they detract from the immersion (Thief: The Dark Project is the most immersive game I have ever played, but I have a hard time becoming immersed now that the graphics are so outdated)."
4,"Funny, but should be digested in bits","Dan Rhodes book is peopled by amusing losers, remorseless heartbreakers and the truly clueless. His ability to convey in 101 words what would take many writers several paragraphs is impressive. I laughed out loud to many of the stories and even read a few aloud to a friend. The only drawback is that the stories all focus on dysfunctional relationships often with a cruel and unloving girlfriend as the subject, so the stories began to grate when read together. I figured that out early and decided to only read a few stories before bed. Much better approach and much funnier when taken in small bits."
2,"Mid-season ""filler"" episodes","For the most part this series is really fun. However, you could skip this set of episodes and not miss much. They are fairly uneventful and the storyline hardly advances. My family looked forward to these but, overall, we were disappointed and bored by the stories."
5,Avatar,"My son loves this collection. This is only one of the movies in the collection, but he has the whole set thanks to Amazon The movies are quite entertaining."
1,a stupid low budget movie,"This movie was a waste of my time, Amazon should give me a refund.The movie was self center, and to be honest with you, I cant tell youwhat it was about. Did the wrritten beg you to put the movie on Amazon????"
5,Love this story!,"I completely LOVE the Bobbsey Twins books, and I'm starting to re-build my collection, finally. This particular one is a favorite, though most of them are favorites! I do wish the cover hadn't been changed, but I'm just happy to be getting these books again. I recommend these to anyone who wants their kids to read, both boys and girls. I'm old to be reading these, (!) but I still love them very much."
2,Can't go back again,"As a grownup, I thought I'd go back and read the series I loved as a kid.I was disappointed in the childish speech, one-dimensional, demeaning characterization ofpeople who are different from the family."
4,VERY GOOD BOOK!,"This book was very good,but I was expecting more action. I will definitely get the next book;which is Bobbsey Twins at the seaside."
1,questionable language for 4-6th graders,"I purchased this book for my about-to-be 4th grader. I liked the format of everything written in the first person-i.e. each of the four characters writes a narrative. The plot ended up being a little thin and the ending was a let down.My biggest objection was the multiple uses of the word ""sucks"" and at least one ""freaking"" (as a substitute for the ""F"" word). Maybe it's acceptable for teens to use these words on a regular basis but I didn't feel it was appropriate for a 9 year old. I discontinued this book with my kids after 2 chapters for this reason. Call me old fashioned but I just thought other parents might like to know the content.As other reviewers have mentioned, the treatment of the war was a little much for this age as well."
4,Hal's review,"This book is about four kids who create a homework machine to do they're homework for them, but is this a gift or a curse? Their classmates begin to get suspicious and attempt to get them to admit it, but will one of them crack?I enjoyed how everyone gets to express they're own point of view throughout the book, and how the author introduces different characters throughout the book. It's a shame that it didn't last longer, but then again I didn't stop reading it so that would be why.The homework machine is one of my favourite books of this genre the layout is fun to read, Dan Gutman has exceeded himself in this book. I like how people that are completely different gradually over time become friends. This was one of the greatest books I've read in a long time. You have to read this book, beacause it is a brilliant read that will interest your kids and most likely yourself."
5,CGE Student Review,"The title of my favorite book is, The Homework Machine by Dan Gutman. He also wrote Mrs. Patty is Batty, and The Get Rich Quick Club. The lesson of this book is to yell out to the people that cheating never does the work for you so don't cheat on anything. The book is fictional.I guess the author likes making the books fascinating because he makes it sound like a real life story of a couple of kids. In the story the friends are Breton, Judy, Sam, Kelsey, Cops, and all the moms.The book is about kids that keep getting in trouble at there foster home and the first day of school comes. If you like fascinating and sneaky books then this is the book for you."
2,HORRIBLE RECORDING,I would really want to give a FIVE star rating if the recording had not been that bad. The SOUND is lifeless. The engineers ought to be shot for marring the performance of this artiste to such a degree. Just plain shameful. I end up getting the other album of hers --- Steppin' which has a much better recording. I would really appreciate another effort to re-record this album; I dun mind getting another piece because her style is oh so wonderful.
5,love it,I always try to purchase these for my sisters and they always receive rave reviews.Some times I have a hard time choosing for them.
1,Rent it on Netflix and save yourself the money,"I bought this dvd for my boyfriend after we were unable to see Dane perform live when he was in town. Tickets were like $70 each and my b.f. couldn't get off work that night. So when it came out on dvd I was pretty excited, I thought we could try again. SOOOOO disappointing (and I'm a Dane Cook fan). This dvd is seriously like 30 minutes of crude sex jokes and like 20 minutes of stupid banter i.e. Dane's interviews. It was way too short and, surprisingly, not very funny. I was actually glad that we weren't able to see him live after watching this because it would have been a huge waste of money. I'm not trying to be a hater I usually really enjoy his work. I just feel gypped that I spent almost $20 on this when I could have just as easily watched it on Netflix and returned it, no harm no foul... well...other than the fact that either way I can never get those 30 minutes of my life back, lol."
1,"Bad , bad , bad","This was a waste of money! Not funny at all just rude, Don't know what happened to him I have always liked him before this."
4,I Love AMAZON,Amazon has great system and I haven't had to return not a single purchase I've received.
1,Just horrible ! ! !,"This should be sold as Historic buyer beware.. Now days with LCD televisions and BluRay DVD's we come to expect recordings that are a joy to see and hear, this falls flat on all counts, save your money..."
4,lazy town cd,"Great cd for the kids,and fans of the show alike.Only thing that spoiled it was the terrible remixof ""bing bang""If it aint broke dont fix it."
5,Very enjoyable,"My kids love these songs and so do I. I find myself listening in the car when they're not with me. Very up beat and gets you moving, good for both kids and the adults who have to listen to it."
5,Catchy and Addicting Tunes,"My kids love listening to this CD - to be honest, my husband and I enjoy it too. Reminds us of ""80's"" techno type tunes. The songs are straight from the Nick Jr. show, which reinforces to kids the importance of living a healthy life. The songs are catchy, addicting and you'll find yourself singing along after just one listen..."
3,One cute song in the bunch.,"After listening to all of the songs, I think the Pirate Theme Song is the only one that I would play again."
5,Hard not to exercise to this music!,My kids started watching LazyTown and I was almost forced to listen but am very glad I did. The music is great and I'm glad there is finally a cd to listen to. The show is designed for children but it has also insprired me to exercise. I'll play the cd even when the kids are in school and can't help but to get some cario exercise in since it makes you want to get up and move!
1,"Words To Describe This CD: Idiotic, Moronic, Annoying, Stupid!","This CD is just awful. The singers have the dopiest voices around (after the cast of JoJo's Circus) and they sing the mostsaccharin sweet lyrics! Who in the right mind would want to listen to this all day? Only an idiot. This album is more stupidthan the TV show and it has oh-so stupid lyrics. Lyrics in goodsongs do not go such as ""Work together, friends forever."" You will completely save your ears if you do not buy this soundtrack! Thank you for taking the time to read this review."
1,"This Girl Has A Nasally Voice And Sticky-Sweet Lyrics, Just Like JoJo!","Not again. The show LazyTown is actually a show worth watching for my age (10), for unlike most preschool shows, it is somewhatmature for older viewers (like me), but the songs I cannot stand! The lyrics to each song are about something stupid or thelyrics wouldn't go together well in a good song such as ""work together, friends forever."" Plus, the voices of each character could wake up the dead and they are just plain nasally, like JoJo from the Playhouse Disney. And what's with ""Bing Bang"" going off in every episode? I mean, the episodes are not about dancing, and the song is. And that's supposed to be an end theme? The most nasally voice of them all is the girl playing Stephanie. Also, I don't know why the show is called LazyTown,cause (1) that's a stupid name and (2) no one's lazy there, also. Before I wrap this review up, I want to make fun and makeanybody cry who actually likes this music:(...)"
1,A left field attempt at astrology.,"The author, Mister Turi, who recieved his Doctor of Metaphysics from the PULC, a recognized California diploma mill, has put forth his claim to the secret lost art of Nostrodamus and applied it to his own brand of astrology.The readings tend to be very general, and highly predictable given only a minor understanding of weather patterns, geological forces, and political boundaries.Astrology is a very interesting topic. This one comes from out of left field and tends to stay there."
1,Look him up on google groups first,You will see how wrong he gets things. Thenyou will not want to waste money on this book.
5,Divine Astrology: The Dragon's Head & the Dragon's Tail,"Dr. Turi's works are a guide for daily planning as well as planning in advance. I have contact with various types of astrologers and know that ""Divine Astrology"" offers a difference. He is not a ""doom and gloom"" prophet, and I have found his predictions to be very accurate. I especially plan travel around his advice. I recommend the knowledge he shares in his books to serious students and those just looking for a little guidance from the stars."
4,The Power of the Dragon,I found the Power of the Dragon to be quite accurate and insightful in it's descriptions of each sign and it's positive and negative aspects.
3,Useful for some things,"This book is helpful if you know absolutely nothing about dance, and need to learn for yourself or your beginning children. When teacher or student says a term, you will be able to know for sure what it means. It will warn against some of the most obvious wrong ways of doing things. It provides basic illustrations of the positions, movements, etc. that are defined.It will not explain which muscles to use to turn your feet out, or which to engage to hold your pelvis upright, or even how your arms should be rotated in order to obtain arms that look like the ones in the illustrations. For that, you will either need your instructor to explain these things in detail (if they are willing and able) or you will need another book or video to help you.It is useful as a basic book of definitions, but no further."
4,The Wild Wild West Complete Series,"Maybe I got lucky. I had read quite a few reviews in regards to this collection and was a little leery about purchasing it. Most of the negative comments were about the packaging and scratches on the discs. These were valid comments. I did find some scratches but the discs played very well either through a blu-ray or standard dv player. The price was right, the quality was very good and I am totally satisified."
2,Worst Packaging Ever,"I just received this as a Christmas gift and I'm still in shock at the crappy packaging. Ever single disc has scratches ranging from minute to ""I wonder if this will actually play in my dvd player?"" I can't believe the morons who came up with the design...I'm sure they aren't into collecting movies or they would have never conceived such a cheap idea. They aren't even in protective sleeves. They sit in small compartment which covers about 2/3 of the discs leaving the tops to carelessly scrape against one another.I thought about returning them but figure I could end up with a set in worse condition. I generally burn all of my movies to discs and play them while leaving the originals on my dvd shelf. I just hope there isn't one or two discs that are completely damaged and cannot be copied.Great series (4 stars in my opinion) and looking forward to watching it again, but the packaging is absolutely horrendous."
4,The Wild Wild West,"I don't have feedback as this is a Christmas gift. As a teen growing up, it was one of my favorite television shows."
4,Wild Wild review,"We were pleased to find this set as we had been looking for it for quiet awhile.The discs themselves have scuff marks on them,probably due to the way they were packed in the two little cardboard cases they came in but so far seem to be playing okay.I enjoyed the show as a youngster and it still seems to be as I remember it.It is a western with a little James Bond and a little Mcgyver thrown in for fun.It's one of the shows I liked as a kid and still like as an adult.Two thumbs up!!"
1,Loyal Fans Get Shaft,"I bought each season as it came out on the day it was released. My reward for that? Getting the shaft by not being able to purchase the reunion movies separately. You always hear from the studios - ""if sales are good on these releases then we'll come out with the next season, etc."" Well -loyal fans showed there was a demand and now we're expected to re-buy everything with the carrot of the two reunion movies. Sorry but I'm not getting ripped off that way. Listen up studios - don't bite the hand that feeds you or we'll simply stop buying your product."
1,Another dissatified customer,"An excellent series, but I'm extremely annoyed that after supporting the studio by buying the individual season sets as they came out I'm going to have to buy the complete series set if I want to get the two post-series movies. As other reviewers have pointed out, the studios keep saying that they depend on sales of season sets to determine if there's interest in a show, but then they turn around and give loyal customers the shaft. You can be sure that I'm going to think twice about buying season sets in the future if this is how I'm going to be treated."
5,Wild Wild West: The Complete Series,"Purchased as a Christmas gift. Have not viewed the DVDs myself, but watched this show with my brother as a kid. I gave the complete series of Wild Wild West to him for Christmas.It was delivered in good condition and on time! Thank You!"
1,Some things do not stand the test of time...,I recalled this being one of my favorite shows (in reruns on cable in the 1980's) as a teenager. I couldn't wait to get this boxed set and see these episodes again... Wow. We forget how far action entertainment has come in the last 30 years!!! Every episode: Jim gets ambushed. Jim fights with clumsy henchmen. Jim gets away. Artemus fools bad guys with disguise. Jim gets girl. Jim drops girl. They ride off on train laughing. I only manged to watch about 3 episodes and couldn't take any more... Some childhood memories are best left memories.
5,Wild Wild West,"This was a Xmas gift for my wife, she loves this series and has been dropping hints since August."
3,DVD's are great,"The DVD's are great and the packaging is very curious. The box the show comes in is much bigger than it needs to be and the DVD's are placed in a precarious way which makes one wonder who came up with such a sub-standard packaging idea. Still, I have adjusted that myself and again say the quality of the DVD's are just fine"
2,The package is terrible,I'm glad that i bought the whole series for a reasonable price. But the package is terrible. The box of the set is a big one. But the discs inside the box could be easily damaged. It's nearly impossible to take the discs without giving some fingerprints on them.
1,Bad Disc's,I have been a fan of this show for years. I too bought each season as it came out. Three weeks ago I purchased the box set because I wanted the movies. Unfortunatly my set was very deffective. The very first disc would only play for the first 20 minutes and then stopped. Upon checking the rest of the disc's I found all but 2 had mild to moderate scratching. The packaging is terrible. I had to return my set.
1,Poor Packing from Manufacturer,"I'm in agreement with the others about the packaging of this item. I was so excited to add this to my collection and I bought it new from another vendor for about $43 and thought it was a steal. Every single disc in the package was scuffed / marked and I had to return it. After reading the same issue in other reviews, I just accepted that I couldn't own this in my collection because the replacement would probably be the same. I returned it for a refund."
2,"Loved the series, hate the packaging","Like many others, I really loved this series and wanted the complete set including the movies. The problem is that the packaging is so bad you risk ending up with discs so badly scratched they won't play. I should have paid attention to the reviews. I've had to return twice after attempting to play the discs. At least eight discs in each set received wouldn't even load in three different DVD players. As much as I want this set I have to pass on purchasing again."
2,Great Series! Horrible Packaging!!!,"If you're a fan of 60s action/adventure series then this series is a must! Conrad and Martin are perfect together as West and Gordon. It's great that the complete series is finally available but, if you can afford it, purchase the seasons individually. The packaging for this complete series set is the worst I've ever seen! The discs aren't even on a spindle or in seperate slots, they are lumped loosely together and can get scratched as they rub up against each other. Whoever designed this packaging should be fired!The series gets 5 stars, the pacakging gets ""0""!"
5,Why I Love The Wild Wild West,I love Jim West. Owning the entire series is big deal to me. Wild Wild West is part of my childhood that I will never let go. I think anyone who purchases the original series will be delighted.
5,Tlhe Wild Wild West,I have enjoyed the series so far. The only problem I have with this purchase is that some of the episodes will not play. I don't know if this is a problem with the DVDs or the problem could be with my DVD player.
5,Get em all!!!,Simply put. You get em all! Nice box too! Wish it had the reunion movies though? Heck i wish someone would put them out. They where fun too.
5,The complete series of The Wild Wild West,"I bought this for my husband and he loves it. I also enjoy watching it. I highly recommend this to everyone who is a fan of ""The Wild Wild West"" It was also a great buy which Amazon always offers. Yeah Amazon !!!!!!!"
1,I love these DVDs! BUT!!!!,"The Wild Wild West DVDs are GREAT! I'm sure this Complete Series DVD set is too. BUT...when a person has already purchased all four seasons DVD sets and now is told that the two reunion movies are to be included in the complete series set and NOT available on their own...well, I'm a bit perturbed. Please make us happy and release the movies. Separately if you must make more money from us fans but at least release them."
3,More Extras Please,"Note: This review was also posted in the Box Set thread for West!I will buy this box set IF it is in Blu-ray format, or more extras are made available beyond the two TV movies. I'd like to see more interviews of surviving actors, directors, writers or even pundits with their inside take. Or perhaps an interview with the lady who wrote the Wild Wild West compilation some years ago. Would love to know how the show carried on past Conrad's late Season 3 injury, or Ross Martin's Season 4 heart attack. Since I already own all four seasons, the point made by another West fan of bypassing this box set unless the two movies are made available separately is well taken. As of mid-Sept., I can't get confirmation on whether worthy, new extras are forthcoming, or the Blu-ray format might be used ... this makes a difference!!"
4,Wonderful Memories!,I loved this original series from years ago...the tricks/actions in the series were unique for that day/time....they continue to entertain even now!
3,Small,"Read the dimensions carefully. This is the second rocking chair that I have bought. The first one was more comfortable, but its seat was made up of springs, fastened with large staples. They started coming loose during the first two weeks. I'm 5'7 and weigh 170. Yes, I'm overweight. With this chair, I have about 3 1/2"" of space left. The length of the seat supports me only about half way up my thighs. The seat cushion I placed on it hangs 2 1/2"" inches over the front of the seat. My back is not shaped like the back of the chair, either. So I added a back cushion, which just makes my legs hang over even more. I found out today that unless I exert a lot of effort, the chair won't rock back. (I haven't been home in while.) What I'm saying is that manufacturers are doing a poor job of telling people what sizes their chairs will support. If you have short legs and a butt of no more than 36"" and weigh no more than 150, then this might be your chair. It is beautiful, but impractical for most people."
2,Carolina Cottage Hudson Rocker,"Over this is a great product, easy to put together. My wife love to use it when she needs to feed our baby. However, I would have to say that the way this product came packaged is one of the worst I've seen. The box was heavily damaged and the product had paint scrapes, deep scratches as a result of POOR packaging. It looked used because of these scratches. I did not want to go through the hassel of calling them up to return the unit which would have damaged it more because the original box was already unusable."
1,Chair legs broke off chair,"We were all happy with this chair until, less than 5 weeks after purchase, my husband was sitting in it and the leg unit on the left side fell off, tossing him to the ground. Thankfully it was not my daughter and the 5 week old baby that fell. My husband is 5'8"" and of normal weight. The chair did not ""break"", it came apart while rocking."
4,Great chair!,"I was hesitant about buying this chair after reading all the reviews, but I decided to take a risk and order it. I am not disappointed! It is not as small as people say it is, if you are 5'4"" or shorter and not obese you'll probably have no problems with this! My husband is 6 feet tall and although rocking is a bit awkward for him, he uses this chair often to feed our baby. It is too big for our 10-year-old, so it is definitely designed for adults. The only down side is the rockers under the legs should be longer, it'd be easier to rock if they were - the chair has a bit of resistance when you rock in it. Other than that, it's very solid, comfortable, and it's made of real wood. It came well packaged, though the wood was chipped in a few places (barely noticeable unless you're really looking). I'm really glad I bought it, it's great for the nursery."
4,Screaming death over North Africa and the med.,"This is an excellent book. The information over all is tight and well explained. The photo's are the book's real strength and the amount and the content are both very interesting. There are 12 pages of color plates at the back showing many different paint designs that the Ju-87 had in the regions. as well as some pilots. My only real complaint is that there was not enough information on the crews that flew there. But the book is still a riveting read, especially if you have not read much on the topic before."
5,Daniel Boone season #1,"this is a Fine Show as it teaches young people morals, ethics and a do the right thing attitude!!!keith A. Bingaman"
5,Great Family Series,Every family should own this DVD. It is great to watch - It will inspire you to do the right things in life and be a responsible person.
4,daniel boone season 1,we have been enjoying the episodes but the packaging is already falling apart. It is very flimsy and i'm not sure it didn't crack in shipping. the dvd's are working well and i can't wait until we get to the seasons in color.
4,beware of shipping,"just to let you know i ordered another copy of this on Dec. 7 with two day shipping and Amazon, after several contacts (mostly overseas in india) with their customer service they have given me such a run around i ended up canceling. with my purchase date of december 7th it was not going to reach me until Feb. 7th. it is availible at other local stores, and good luck getting someone in customer service that knows whats going on."
2,A Disaster!,"What a HUGE disappointment this release is. I was suspecting that it wouldn't be all that great when I saw that the studio that originally produced this show, 20th Century Fox, was the same video company releasing it. Well, the first season looks horrible. The source material is all 16mm dupe prints, some parts of which are out of focus, scratched and dirty. In all cases the image is soft and, well, like 16mm. Compared to what Fox is releasing of VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, produced the same year (1964) and at the same studio as BOONE, this release is nothing short of a disgrace. We should be given pristine 35mm source material, and we're not. I suspect Fox wouldn't release the original camera negs from it's vaults without a substantial fee. Anyway, season one of DANIEL BOONE isn't worth buying. I haven't seen season two, when the show started filming in color, but I'm now afraid to look."
2,Poor quality,"I really love the Daniel Boone program, so I bought the dvd. This dvd is very poor quality. The show skips many times. One episode cut off mid program - so you never were able to see the conclusion. The dvd is not worth buying because you cannot even see the entire episode."
4,Daniel Boone Season 1,The product was exactly what I thought it would be and am very pleased. Thank you.
3,quality problem with disk 7,"Recently bought season 1. Played 1 through 6. Perfect. Unfortunately disk 7 is a mess. 43 minutes into the Cain's Birthday part one, tracking went all over the place. Sound distorted. And that is just the good part. Jammed our dvd player. Thought that we would never get the dvd out of it. Tried to exchange at the store and found out that the other copy was in even worse shape. Did play volume 8 and that is just fine. Be very careful. Tried calling Liberation Entertainment and their mailbox is full. I am not surpised. If you can find a good one, maybe you can tell how Cain's birthday ends( would not even let me go to part 2).Good news update. Only took three stores to find a good copy. Found out the ending. Thanks to all who offered help. By the way, season two is great."
5,Simply Marvellous,"Peter Valder has now established himself as one of the world's major horticultural writers with his ""Gardens in China"" the new companion volume to his wonderful, award winning, ""Garden Plants of China"". This book looks at over 200 gardens that the author has visited over a period of twenty years. It is a richly descriptive work both historically and geographically and is extremely readable, to the point that it is almost impossible to put down. The photography once again is simply stunning. Besides the famous classical gardens of Suzhou Valder gives a fascinating overview of temple courtyards , parks, cemeteries, botanical gardens and arboreta(many established since the cultural revolution) in every corner of this vast country. If you are contemplating a visit to China there could be no better preparation than reading Valder's ""Gardens in China"". If you are not going to China then travel there vicariously via this magnificent book. A must for every serious garden lovers bookshelf."
4,Almost as good,"Rich in information, indispensible for its coverage of the diversity of Chinese garden types (particularly temple gardens), written for the same audience as his 1999 book, concentrating on plants and planting, this is a travel guide to over two hundred gardens in China (although, because of its weight and size, one that you'd leave in your hotel room). Structured similarly to the previous book, with good introductions to each section with individual verbal descriptions of each garden with 1, 2 or a few more photos (including some historical comparisons). Two disappointments: there are only two Chinese characters in the whole text (no names), reducing its utility for scholars, and there are no maps of sites, plans or other drawings that would make it more useful for designers."
1,Not much more than the Quicken help file,"How's this for valuable advice under the heading ""Ten Things You Should Do If Your Account Doesn't Balance"": ""Make sure you're working with the right account.""Overall, Stephen Nelson hasn't done much more than taken the Quicken 2004 help file and larded it with fluff that anyone whoever has balanced a checkbook should be familiar with.hNot worth the price, in my estimation.Jerry"
4,Brilliantly Captures Limerick's Many Colorful Characters,"Curtin is a wonderful and charming wordsmith who manages to nicely share his warm and inviting, albeit sometimes, quirky, city and its equally colorful characters with those seeking an alternative to the overly processed slough typically served up as Irish wit. Despite the common setting, don't expect another Angela's Ashes or anything like it; Curtin in no way attempts to imitate Limerick's most famous son and certainly doesn't have to. His talents, characters and themes can well stand on their own. Limerick is a city that has been given a black eye in recent years but allow this book to take you beyond the press and introduce you to some believable and even memorable people in a very real world of sometimes hilarious, sometimes desperate situations."
4,Great stories,"I had to read some of the short stories featured in this book, and I thought it would be boring. When I started to read the first one, ""The Phychiatrist"" (please excuse my spelling!) I was actually laughing! This was a school assignment! I recommend this book to anyone who likes short stories in particular, and who is interested in the Latino culture."
1,Too much female testosterone,"Through romance novels, women can take a break from the daily dullness and live out a fantasy or two. How many women who read romance novels can relate to female lead characters who have more testosterone than the males in the book? Most of us do not fantasize about carrying an M16. I wouldn't want a man to admire me or feel attracted to me because of the way I can keep my rifle clean or lob a grenade. That's not real Romance (pretend that word was written in flowing script). That's not a woman or book with sex-appeal; that's ""butch-appeal."" I've about decided to write my own books since I can't find any out there to fill my needs. Thank you for your time."
2,Huh?,"I'm still in the process of reading this one but felt I had toshare. As with every book Ms. Yarbo thanks those who read the book for clarity, content, errors, etc. Her thanks were premature. There are at least two glaring inconsistencies of plot in this one.Was she even paying attention as she wrote it?"
3,Maybe I'm Hard to Please,"This was a big step up from her last work, though still a bit tedious in a number of places. For the most part the culprit is the dialog--lengthy conversations that repeated the same points until I was ready to scream, ""OK, I get the idea already."" The story threads never really seem to wind together and a number of things dwelled upon have no bearing on the plot at all. However, the love interest, Tulsi Kil saves the book. Hers is a strong character, searching for herself and only willing to settle for her own mind. Saint Germain seems a bit flat next to her....come to think of it, he's been a bit flat lately in general. SNAP OUT OF IT, SG!!!"
2,"For erotic viewing only - no plot, but some hot sex scenes.","What this one lacks in plot, character development and film making, it makes up for in skin content & some smoking simulated sex. Two babes do the erotic heavy lifting here.Tanya Adams is a tall, lithe, leggy blonde with perfect champagne glass boobies and a face that kinda favors Jillian Grace. Here, she is in 3 or 4 scenes - a couple nice b/g and a really hot outdoor girl/girl with another cute blonde.Nicole Oring is an attractive Asian - nice body and enthusiastic performer. She gets busy in a couple of good boy/girl pairings.Nothing great here, and only mediocre compared to other torchlight features, but worth a viewing when you can get it for 5-6 bucks. The production is competent, I've payed more $ for worse, and I found Tanya to be quite sexy and worth the view."
1,Why was this book written,"Perhaps I should ask why it was published and how come some of those folks on the back cover mislead us with undue praise. Did they read the bool or just endorse it as a favor? There should be more integity in the reviewers who are often paid by the book company or do some one a favor in exchange for a good review of their work, but this leads us to mustrust them and regret spending money on books that waste our time.This is so here in a book about one man's journal during a summer sabbatical while he prepares to teach a one day workshop on Merton's poetry. It adds nothing to the glut of Merton books and sheds no new light on Merton himself. What it does do is show us how the author is enamored with Merton, whose poetry was after all not that good, and who would not appreciate such hero worship."
4,Great Book,"When I first saw this book I thought,Whoa thats a helluva lot of pages (over 1000). As it turned out I'm glad that I geve the book a try instead of casting it off as way too long. It turned out to be an extremely exciting, if not fact filled book. Granted its going to take an extremely long time to read this book but there is nothing better than an exciting book that you cant put down for those long flights, trust me you'll be glad you brought it along! This shows how the war really was, even though it is fiction, from the American Anti-War sentiment to Mussolini's unpopularity. I'm really looking forward to reading the sequel, War and Remembrance."
5,I was sad to see this end.,"I read the sequel first, and was so enthralled I read Winds when I was done. They were a wonderful part of my life for three months of pleasure reading. A very good story that is exceptionally historically accurate."
5,Fantastic,"This is one of the best books I've ever read and an authoritative overview of the opening phases of World War II. Instead of creating superhero protagonists, Wouk's characters are complex and believable. His descriptions of Pug Henry's encounters with FDR, Hitler, and Stalin are priceless and the military analysis is spot-on. The Winds of War represents the number-one achievement in World War II historical fiction."
5,One of my top three books ever,One of the few books that I universally recommend and that I have never had someone tell me they were disapointed.
5,History with a personal perspective...,"I read Winds of War (and then its sequel, War and Remembrance) a few years ago and enjoyed it thoroughly.Herman Wouk weaves in the story of the Henry family through the ordeal of Second World War. The reader gets a very personal look at World War II (on all fronts, including the Holocaust) through the eyes of this tight knit American family.Although it's a pretty big book, the pages fly by...!"
1,The Attack on Bearl Barbor??????????,"Extremely insulting that no one ever proof reads books after conversion to kindle format. While the kindle edition appears to have undergone some clean up after so many negative reviews for a chapter to have ""Bearl Barbor"" as the title is beyond belief. There are many other conversion errors with improper character recognition but I did not track those. A few problems with hyphenation also remain where the printed edition used hyphenation as a means to word/line wrap but the after conversion to kindle the hyphen is no longer appropriate since the line wrap occurs at a different point in the line. There are a few graphics from the printed version also scanned into the kindle edition and therefore of poor quality. Can only imagine how bad War and Remembrance kindle edition must be since that title has been unavailable for many months while awaiting correction."
5,Why did I not read this before?!,"Really...I'm old enough to remember when this was first published! Maybe I should be grateful that I read it at a mature age, I probably appreciated it more. The Winds of War and War and Rememberance (which I also read and give 5 stars to) are the story of a fictional American family, a Navy family, and their lives during the run up to WWII and during the war itself. I have read a great deal about WWII, both fiction and non fiction, and this is a great work. The narrative is beautiful, the characters are written with great depth and insight (male and female, civilian and military alike) and the story spans the entire globe. There isn't a dull moment.What is amazing about the story is how well the personal trials and tribulations of the Henry clan are woven into the world history that is unfolding. Joy, love, death, betrayal, and all of it beautifully told.Wouk is a brilliant writer and a wonderful story teller."
3,Kindle edition sloppily formatted,"I was thrilled to find The Winds of War on Kindle just days after I'd been thinking I'd love to reread it -- there's nothing better than reading a really long book on a Kindle, for weight reasons alone.But the formatting seems to have been done either in haste or with no oversight whatsoever -- it's full of typos, missing letters and even the occasional missing phrase or sentence.Herman Wouk deserves better."
2,Quality issues with Kindle edition,"""The Winds of War"" and ""War and Remembrance"" are two of my favorite books and other critics have given them good reviews for the hardback and paperback editions. I do have to express my disgust with the quality of the Kindle editions. In ""The Winds of War"" there were several typos, one of which was in over sized type that fairly screamed from the page. In ""War and Remembrance"" there are so many popping up that it is extremely distracting. One typo can be humorous, two can be a nuisance, but when they crop up nearly every other page, it becomes quite annoying and distracting. I believe the publishers should make the proper corrections and make corrected ones available for a second download. So far this has been my only encounter with typos in Kindle editions."
5,unbelievable story,"This ""story"" is really amazing. The way it's told, the language the author uses, the character development, the accuracy of millions of facts and lastly, but most importantly, the way this book filled with facts reads like a really good novel! I'm never bored and always left wondering. I'm learning more now than ever before (and my undergraduate minor was in history)!!"
5,Great History Lesson,"This book along with it's companion, War and Remembrance, are so full of vivid history. I learned from these books more about WWII including what led up to it than any history class, documentary, or history book could ever provide.On top of all this history is a touching tale about a military family that suffers the highs and lows of personal events (romance, divorce, death, etc.) while rubbing elbows with all the great names of that time.The authors descriptions of some of the battle scenes (The German defeat of the French) are so real that I felt I had experienced them first hand. This should be required reading for any WWII history class."
5,The Winds of War,The Winds of War & War & Remembrance I watched this great movie on DVD .And look forward to reading this book.
5,Exceptional historical background & analyses,"This book, and it's companion, ""War and Remembrance"" are two of my favorite novels of WWII. I read/re-read them about every ten years. I find them exceptionally well written with clearly drawn characters who enter the traumic period of Western civilization's march through the use of the industrial model for the destruction of millions of people and an end to traditional European colonial powers. I find myself caring about the characters, their losses, and how they delt with a world bent on destruction; characters trying to balance traditional values while creating new beginnings from the ashes of a world focused on self-destruction and death. I have read most of Mr. Wouk's books and have been a fan of his writings for many years. You will not be disappointed."
4,Not a Love Story,Wouk does a magnificent job of providing the background of the US prior to our comittment in World War Two.
2,Kindle Edition Loaded With Typos,This is a wonderful book and a terrific follow up to The Winds of War. The poor rating is solely because the Kindle edition has loads of typos that significantly detract from the reader's enjoyment.
4,Excellent,"This book is one of the best books I have read. It gives a realistic picture of Europe before World War 2, and the struggles of a military family."
1,"Occasionally interesting, but dull for the most part.","This book was a complete disappointment, A few words will summarize it ""Too much Wind and not enough War"". Lots of of mindless chatter among seriously shallow characters."
3,a sequel?,A good book but i didn't know there is a sequel. I don't think I would have bought the first one.
2,"""The Winds of War""",Love the book but the overall condition of the book and the cover was a little less than the condition indicated.
3,The Winds of War - hardcover,"I was somewhat disappointed with the book. It is obviously a book club edition and not a suitable shelf companion to the other Herman Wouk books that I have. Perhaps a more detailed description concerning size and condition would have been helpful. The cost was acceptable and delivery promt. This is not a complaint against the seller. Since I am a first-time buyer, I will use this as a learning experience and ask more questions in future."
1,Amazon Should Be Ashamed,"Herman Wouk should be proud of this classic, a fascinating book that contains a comprehensive story of the early years of World War II through the experiences of the fictional family of ""Pug"" Henry who has encounters with Hitler, Stalin, Roosevelt, and many others. It is a great book. I own the hard cover and thoroughly enjoyed reading it in print.However, ordering the Kindle edition of the text from Amazon was a tremendous disappointment. [...]Don't buy this book for your Kindle."
2,Boringly educational,"I started this book with an open mind becasue I had heard it was a good book. However, after several hundred pages I was STILL waiting for something EXCITING to happen. Although it's educational and is accurate about the events of WWII, I found it unbearably boring and fell asleep everytime I read it for over 10 min. The only reason I read it was because it was assigned to me for a book report. I love to read, but this book was too long and strung out. I skipped 400 pages and still got A's on two book reports. My instructors (who both read the book) thought I read the whole thing because I gave accurate book reports without the knowledge of what happened in the middle of the book. That goes to show how eventful it is. The only reason it scored two stars with me was because it is educational and a war buff might enjoy it, but if you like ""people"" stories, don't bother with this book."
4,"Amazon ""Looks Inside"" the wrong book","Be aware that the book shown when you take a ""Look Inside"" is NOT the book you get. What they show is a bound copy of the musical score with the libretto added. What you get is the libretto described in the written review, no musical score. That having been said, the book you get is useful and of interest, and the CD is a great recording."
1,THIS IS A CARTOON NOT AN EPISODE,"For all of us who are waiting for Xena dvds for region 1 (USA), this is not it.....it is merely some cartoon interactive video game. I am not reviewing it, because I am leaving it unopened, and returning it today....what a disappointment"
1,This is not Xena,Very disappointed. Thought I was getting Xena movie or episodes to watch based on the pictures on the cover of the dvd. Turned out to be some lame attempt at a video game instead!
4,"Dated, but still relevant","While the material is quite dated, so much about UNIX and UNIX-like environments today are still built on the same foundations. Thus was a book that I enjoyed exploring as kid and I still have find memories of it. The book is not complicated, unless you try to skim through it. And, as with any good book about technology, you should not try to skim through it."
3,Tries to be cute,By now looking at the published date you can tell this book is a tad dated. However the information in it is sound and still applicable to today's environment.I am afraid that this is one of those books that nobody likes because if you already know the information them the book is too basic. If you do not know the information the book is too confusing. Voodoo is a prefect title for the book as it tells you a lot of tips and tricks without the bother to tell you the theory or the extension of what you have learned.I have to admit that I learned a couple of things from the book. However it is not worth spending the time and money on those items that I would have probably found eventually.
5,Coleman Hawkins at his Best,"The recordings of Ain't Misbehavin' and If I Had You feature two of the most wonderful tenor saxophone solos that I have heard in over forty years of listening. Billy Taylor's piano solo on If I Had You is every bit as wonderful. Hawk died in 1969 while I was in the service but I often thought that if I ever had the occasion to meet Billy Taylor I would thank him for these two wonderful recordings. On night I was sitting at the bar in the Blue Note Cafe in NY and Biily Taylor walked by on his way out the door. He glanced my way and nodded but I did not take the opportunity to introduce myself. I'll always regret that lost opportunity because Dr. Taylor has passed on.I knew Eddie Bert through J.R. Monterose who was a friend of mine. We used to spend time together and Eddie always had a fond recollection of making these recordings.At the risk of stating the obvious, jazz simply does not get any better than this."
5,A very good solution for work lighting!!,Put three of these on a utility tractor we use for snowplowing. They do an excellent job of throwing light right where we need it. I'd highly recommend them. Very high quality construction with a powerful beam!
4,Interplay's Classics!,"25th Anniversary is the BEST game ever!!! My mom and I played it with the walkthrough and even though the graphics were not that good, the story plots are good! I think that the Elasi pirates are funny.Judgement Rites- I have not ever played judgement rites but would like to.Starfleet Academy- I have this game at my house and I do agree with some of the other reviewers. Basicaly, Ijust play this game for creating missions. (E.G. Klingon Ship vs. Romulan Ships). I do not actually play the game levels. I think it is stupid that you cannot play Spock, Bones, or any of the other characters. You have to play a stupid Cadet, much like other Star Trek Games (E.G. Bridge Commander, Elite Force I and II). But the space combat is pretty fun. I like to play a Romulan ship and I also like to shoot friendly ships."
3,Old Games of the PC,"The Star Trek: Federation Compilation, made by Interplay, whose long line stretches about 20 years of history. Some of those games were Star Trek PC games. Big successes were Starfleet Command, Klingon Academy, 25th Anniversary and Judgement Rites (both are here in the Federation Compilation). 25th Anniversary, the first game for the PC by Interplay was made, and soon it was successful after its release in 1993. 1995 rolled around. Interplay made another hit game, Star Trek: Judgement Rites. The game was made approximately six months after 25th Anniversary was released. The game was so successful that people buyed a CD with voiceovers for Judgement Rites. Now, here comes Star Trek: Starfleet Academy- Cadet Briefing. It's just a demo for 1998's Star Trek: Starfleet Academy- Strategic Command. 4 levels for the game are here."
5,Eat Pray Love,"My daughter wanted this book during a tough time in her life, and it gave a lot of comfort to her. GREAT find."
4,"My Comments on Eat, Pray, Love","I really enjoyed this book. It was well written, entertaining and funny. I think the author could have provided the reader with a little more information about the reason for her divorce (since it is the main reason she proceeds on this journey)-she mainly talks about sitting in the bathroom crying, but we don't know why she thinks so poorly of her husband or why she decides to leave him.It is a great travel adventure and makes you want to travel to Italy, Indonesia and India."
3,This woman needs help,"Though this book was entertaining at times and makes me want to visit Italy, I found her very selfish and emotionally immature woman. It is just disheartening that in her bathroom she had God talking to her and not a woo woo guru. But did she turn to God, and ask for guidance, no! She went for the feel-good religion of the liberals and the misguided. Let's take a look at things from a realistic perspective. She didn't get onto anti-depressants until after destroying her marriage. What if she got counseling and anti-depressants before her divorce? I don't think I will finish the story, but from the other reviews it looks like after running around the world she is still lost. ""I am the way and the truth and the life."" John 14:6 Maybe if she turn to God instead of worldly endeavors she may have discovered something. Unfortunately, Christ isn't cool and sheik and Eastern religions get a free ride."
2,Lucky Author without Graciousness,"Elizabeth Gilbert, I don't mean to be critical about your life experiences. You've gone through a lot. But, you're a pretty darn lucky woman to have had the chance to travel the world on a pre-release book grant while other citizens of the world have had to deal with the demons of their minds in their local community without any support from employers, family, or friends.I enjoyed reading about your story, until I realized that you couldn't seem to clearly describe the silver lining in your worldly experiences for the rest of us who cannot escape to the delicacies of Italy, the deities India, and the desolate beaches in Indonesia to heal.I've cautiously recommended your book to friends, but I can't quite understand what all the hype is about. Perhaps I shouldn't have set my expectations so high."
5,Transformational story,"Elizabeth Gilbert bares her soul in all its vulnerability in this biography. It is a very honest piece. Most importantly, she continues to bloom beyond the period she describes in her maturing as a human being and writer."
2,meh,first third of the book was good...middle part was ok but got annoying quickly...the end was worse. meh. if i wasnt reading it for a book club i wouldnt have finished it.
2,Boring,I received this book as a gift and so forced myself to continue reading it long after the over-hyped light started flashing. Not only was this book boring but I think the most outstanding issue was this woman's total self absorption. That was mind numbing!
1,Not an Exploration into Compassion or Consciousness,"Sorry, but doesn't feasting on brutalized animals seem at all incongruous with the pursuit of enlightenment to this author? Odd odyssey."
2,"Good book, sloppy production","I don't know if this is a widespread production glitch with this title,but some pages are repeated in 10-20 page chunks. Toward the end entire chapters are missing.Perfectly interesting story, but a severely defective product makes it unreadable."
4,Great read,"The author rides an extreme emotional roller coaster at the beginning of the book. She goes through a divorce and then immediately jumps into an all consuming relationship. After that ends, she journeys through Italy, India and Indonesia to find good food, ""religion"" and true love. I think it's a great read. There are a few slow parts (hence the 4 stars), but for the most part, it's a page turner. The utter frankness in which she tells her story and bravely embarks on these new experiences is completely endearing. Gilbert doesn't claim to have all of the answers, but does set out to find them. It's a very courageous and honest book that I was glad to read. I've seen the reviews about her being selfish, self-indulgent, etc. In some ways, I would agree, but as she's being completely candidate about her spiritual journey and what she needs to make her whole again, I think it's only fitting."
4,An inspirational journey,"I thought Eat Pray Love was a beautiful story of one woman's courage to discover her soul's purpose. It was both comforting and exciting to read, however, the downside to it was that many women can not imagine that the fairytale outcome of Elizabeth Gilbert's life could ever happen to them. The spiritual journey is frought with heart ache and pain usually, as it takes years of counseling, and spiritual practice to heal old habits and to discover who you truly are as a spiritual being. Consider the following read as one that you will connect with if it has taken you years of work to Heal Your Life.Oh...For the Love of God: A Tell All Story of a Woman's Journey Toward Self-Discovery"
5,"Rated 5.5 Stars, by a Critic!","OK, it was my crazy GF, who loves this inspiring author and she subsequently bought about a dozen to send out as X'mas gifts, to some of her lucky family & friends! It sure beats sending out the same fruit cake that has been circulating around in our network for years!I will leave the feedback on this book for someone else, as I've not read it yet."
5,Loved it!!,"I totally loved this book. So much good information and thought provoking ideas. You have to be a person who likes to think outside of the box and are open to different ways of spirituality. I can't wait to read it again. The author is fantastic, adding comedy to many of her experiences. I totally GET this book!"
5,"Entertaining prose, good sense of humor",ad ... and worthwhile to read. Comes across as an honest description of a life transition.
1,Self-indulgent rubbish,"All the hype and good reviews may have set my expectations too high, but this is the worst book I've ever read. I slogged through it trying to find what others said had ""changed their lives"". It was boring beyond belief; and I particularly hated the pretence of being honest."
1,Grueling Uninteresting Journey to Maturity,"Okay, I've been kicking myself to finish reading this for a month for my book club. This is a book all about discovering self identity and self concept which makes me want to gag given, a woman of her age should already be there. It just is not entertaining written in the voice she uses which fails to invite her readers into the who what why when and how of how she arrived at the point of no where at this late stage in life. This would have allowed readers to connect and identify with her. I understand this is a memoir of her journey but she could have written it with a common thread to tie it together to make it more cohesive for her readers. In my opinion, it rambles aimlessly and I don't think I will be able to finish reading it."
3,Not bad,"This book was not as good as the reviews led me to believe. I do recommend the book, but I think that the reviews made the book more popular than it should have been."
3,"OK. Not great, not horrible, but OK.","I decided to read this book to see what all the hype was about. I'm interested in Eastern religions, so I was looking forward to the India section, but the thing that really rang true to me was: ""...People follow different paths....and all reach You, just as rivers enter the ocean."" But overall, I was pretty bored with this book. It just didn't hold my interest."
3,glad this was a gift!,if you get it as a gift it's an ok read. but i certainly wouldnt spend my hard earned money on it. i didnt particularly care for this style of writing. often times i was bored when she would ramble. overall it's cute.
1,"Eat, Pray, Love: One woman's search for more money","The premise of this book is that some depressed lady decides to go Italy, where she dines at a fine Italian place and then decides that she could then travel to India and other 3rd world countries and write about the food she ate and all this somehow leads her to all the answers in her uncertainties in life.Sounds pretty boring, but people have still decided to read it. Once one review was published showing the book in a positive light, everybody jumped on the bandwagon so that the book would become so popular that YOU would feel stupid for not reading it. But I will not fall for this, this book is, without a doubt, boring, and I refuse to read it, and anybody who thinks it is absurd of me to judge other readers and says that this book is delightfully entertaining and life changing can go jump down a well."
5,"review of Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert","A delightful and inspirational account of one woman's path to heart. Ms. Gilbert is witty, passionate and easily brings the reader into the moment in all of the moments of her very interesting year in Itally, India and Indonesia."
2,Great title!,"I enjoyed the authors writing style, however I found this book irksome. Gilbers's writing is down to earth but she was ever so whiney throughout the book. I found her selfish and self-absorbed. The best part of this book is the title."
1,Can You Rate a Book Half a Star?,"...because if you could, this tome would get it. As voiced so well by other readers, it is a vapid, self-centered, incoherent narrative.The author should have her medication adjusted."
4,An enjoyable book,"I recently had a marriage end and this book really seemed to speak to me. Anyone who has had a break-up after a long relationship can relate. The book is sad, funny, insightful and well written."
1,You must be kidding,"I cannot believe the positive reviews this book is getting. I have never read such self absorbed drivel in my life. The guru that she is talking about is the lightly veiled Guru Mayi, the celebrity guru for celebs who just can't get happy enough.The author is using this book to purge herself. She keeps saying she isn't going to talk about her divorce, but never shuts up about her divorce.I got through most of India and then called it a day. I have real books to read."
1,Drivel,This book was so contrived. Gilbert whines and whines and whines. She tries too hard to be self-deprecating. I skipped half of the section on Italy because it was not interesting to me. The sections on India and Indonesia were marginally more appealing. Very overhyped IMHO.
1,It's all about ME ME ME ME ME!!!,"This is, without a doubt, the most self-indulgent pile of schlock I have ever come across. No, I couldn't even finish it.I'm a cancer survivor so I'm all about getting the most out of life. But to trash other people's lives in order to do that? Not a chance. This is exactly what the main charater did to her former husband...I'd say ""the poor soul"" but he's really a VERY lucky man to not have to put up with this whiny, selfish, self-indulgent brat any longer.Save your money. Don't buy the book and don't see the movie, much as I love Julia Roberts. It's only feeding the ""all about me"" machine that is Liz Gilbert. Yuck!"
1,"whiny, shallow, sophomoric",I don't get the hype. This was truly awful stuff. Someone in our book group pointed out that Liz Gilbert's other books were well received but I'm not inclined to read any of them: nothing about this author's style appealed to me and I definately don't trust the reviewers when it comes to her work.
1,This book......SUCKED!,"SO many people said I HAD to read this book. So I took it out from the Library and returned it 4 days later. I couldn't even finish the book which is rare for me. This book is so poorly written and so self absorbed. Eat, Pray and love, sure, but don't waste time or money reading this book."
1,Couldn't get through it,"This book did not ring true for me at all. If the author was in the middle of such a horrible breakdown how did she muster up the energy to go to a publisher and get a book deal and then set out for a year of traveling? I just couldn't get into listening to her complain about her life anymore. I had to put it down. Maybe I missed something but, I DO NOT recommend this book."
1,Too Airy-Fairy for Me,"I was hoping this would be a rich journey of a woman finding herself in the larger context of the world vs the rather narrow confines of ""woman's role"" in America. I couldn't read far into the book before giving up. The author seems prone to emotional excess which even she can't explain. Clingy with her new love after her divorce, she whipsaws between ecstatic closeness and what amounts to clinical depression on an almost day-to-day basis. Some chemical problem she was born with that causes her misery? In her place, I would just have had fun for as long as it lasted. Then moved on to the next phase--and perhaps man--in her life. This strikes me as a woman who isn't very grounded, but seeks outside support of various stripes in the hope she will finally feel okay. Sadly, I quickly just didn't care whether she felt okay or not. I'm sure she is talented enough in putting sentences together, but I didn't feel the book had any substance. Many apparently loved the book--no idea why."
1,What is all the hype?,"I think that this is the most annoying, self-absorbed book I have ever, EVER read. Let's see, a very wealthy woman goes through a nasty divorce but has enough money to take 1-1/2 yrs to find herself. No bills to worry about, no children, no job to keep her down. Just herself. And she is so distraught that she decides to explore food, then prayer, then love. This book could be renamed EAT, PRAY, PUKE. I will give her this: she had the dough to get this best PR firm and do a massive, masterful promotion and media hype, even Oprah. Because of that, she sold a million books. so what?"
1,"Eat, Pray, Love and Search....for a different book","This was a terribly written, whiney account of a woman's pathetic attempt to find someplace, anyplace where she could feed her ego. It was easily one of the worst books I've ever read."
1,Do not waste your time!,"Everyone seemed to rant about the movie. I tried sitting through it but found it too tortuous to bear past the 15-minute mark so I decided to read the book. I am now left more upset at the time I wasted. Gilbert turned out to be a self-absorbed extremely privileged middle-age woman who in search for everything couldn't seem to get past her enormous ego. A complete waste of time, this is when a zero star should be available."
2,Boring,"I wasn't captured by this book at all. I felt like the main character was complaining and wallowing in despair and found it pathetic and annoying. Although it is nice to travel through Italy, India and Indonesia, I didn't make it past Italy. This is a good book for someone who is not in a good place romantically. I began to read it while I was planning a wedding so perhaps that is why I didn't like it due to the content and my state of mind."
2,"My God Woman, Get OVER it.....","So, you tell me you have to go to 3 countries, find God, meditate, etc. to get over a husband and a lover? Good Lord. How little one must think of themself if the ""pity-party"" lasts for that very long. In the course of the book, she tries to tell women to see their inner worth - that we are not solely dependant on a man for happiness. And, where does she end up? Right back in the fray - right back where she started from. On the other hand, there were a few good lines in the book. A few good insights. A few good quotes - such as: ""Give us this day our Daily Gripe."" She used this to describe how annoyingly negative people are. On this - and a few other points, I totally agree. However, as far as Liz and men are concerned - I think she needs a man sort of as a crutch. Walking strong, proud and free ain't such a bad thing, Liz. It's just not as hard as you make it....."
3,fascinating but limited,"I did enjoy this book and was sorry when it ended. Loved her honesty and forthrightness overall. A couple of negatives:... self-absorbed - author is very self-absorbed but I found it more amusing than irritating. When she was searching for the one word that would describe her, my suggestion was 'needy.' That's not what she came up with but that would be my assessment. I'm guessing 75% of the book uses the words I, me, or my.... ending - I was disappointed in the ending and her long description of island vigil from a few years prior. All it did was stop the momentum that had been going while in Bali.I know this was a memoir but more about the locations and less about self would have been better. The most interesting parts were when she described the cultural nuances that we may never hear about otherwise. The ending was inadequate as I felt like I'd come a long way reading but to no avail. Would have liked to have heard more about life since and after the III trip."
3,book: Eat Pray Love,"the book was not as intersting as i thought it would be. it's not one of those can't put down books, but is one i'll finish."
3,Take it For What it Is,"First let me say, this book changed my life. There were things said that I needed to hear. I understand that won't be the case for everyone. If you're reading the book for the hype or a great, seamless story that makes you feel like you're right there with her, then I believe you will be disappointed. If you are driven to read this by something you just can't explain then I think you'll get what you need from it. I think she is an ok writer. Not great. She's tells an ok story but it could have been a great story. For me, this was not one of those books that you just can't put down, that draws you in so deeply you forget to eat. I had to force myself to press through it but I was able to because there are pieces of it that kept me coming back for more. There are interesting experiences, information, and revelations sprinkled throughout the book - they may or may not be worth it for you."
3,"See ""Postcard: Bali"" in ""Time""8/30/2010","This article by Hillary Brenhouse shows only too well the disastrous effect of this book.Thousands of so-called ""spiritual tourists"" flooding Bali, completely ignorant of the complexities of local culture, knowing not a word of the language or history, and using the island for their own trivial search for diversions from their boring Western lives.If only they had stayed with ""Disney World"" which perfectly matches their needs.Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia"
4,Not what I anticipated,"For the past few years, every time I have passed this book in a store, I have picked it up, wanting to read it. For whatever reason, I always put it down, never buying it. When the movie came out, I figured it was a sign that it was good so I bought it. I can NOT get into it. I guess the word is dry."
1,Narcissist-Lit,"Ms. Gilbert wallows in the excruciating detail of her ""journey"" of self-improvement, as she evolves from self-indulgent neuroses to neurotic self-indulgence. Along the tedious way, she makes a few interesting observations on her context, but insufficient to justify the book."
4,Good book.,Good book…followed the movie pretty well. Not really a genial public book though. Definitely geared for women. Buy it for your mom.
1,would you like some cheese with that wine??,Gave this book one star...it actually deserves -10!!! what a boring boring stupid book.....I felt no connection to the author at all...I actually wished she would end up in a lunatic asylum....it's just ranting and raving of a spoilt brat...don't waste your money on it.....go get a bottle of wine instead or watch painjt dry...much more fun!!
1,Spiritual! Please!,"This is pap. Because it is a selection by one member of our book group I felt forced to read beyond 40 pages which is my upper limit for quiting a book. The writer is self-serving, whiney, superficial and has the nerve to call this, in effect, a spiritual search. You don't need to travel to find compassion which she seems to be in short shrift of, to see the world as a complex place which she seems to miss since she is always and only looking through her eyes, and to be celebate for a year which she seems to think is lusting with eyes, taste, and imagination but not in actual fact which makes her more spiritual. Run from this self-serving monologue."
1,Simply awful,"What a load of narcissistic, self-indulgent, whiney tripe! The only reason I finished this piece of crap was because I was incouraged to do so by a coworker who loved the book. All I can is, what a whiner! Your marriage ended? Poor you; it happens all the time. Your relationship with your boyfriend ended? See previous sentence. With absolutely no responsibilities whatsoever, you were able to just pack up and indulge your pathetically crippled emotions in a year of doing whatever the hell you want - stuff your boring face in Italy, sit on your ass in India and fart around in Bali. Wow, aren't you a role model for women everywhere - NOT. Deal with the death of a spouse, being a single parent, watch a parent die a slow death from Alzheimer's and get back to us, will ya?Deleted this piece of garbage from the Kindle the second I finished reading it. Simply terrible."
1,Boring!!!,"This is THE most boring book I have ever read. I tried to finish it but couldn't quite make it. The story of an insane unfulfilled woman who finds no pleasure in her marriage, divorces and drops her live in New York to travel for a year to find herself in Rome, India and Indonesia. The books goes on all the way about her depression after her divorce and basically has nothing to say. I give out my copy if you are interested."
1,Shallow diary of a spoiled little rich girl,"I am so upset with myself for spending money and padding this woman's royalty check. What a disappointing book. She had no respect whatsoever for her marriage vows and left her husband just because she changed her mind. Then she is so ""stressed"" with her privileged life that she has travel around the world and ""find herself."" Give me a break. She is shallow, self-absorbed, immature, and spoiled. Not to mention incredibly conceited to think that she has any ""spiritual insight"" to give after her little spa vacation get-away. Don't waste your money. Watch a rerun of Sex and the City - any episode of that show will provide the basic outline for this book."
2,Eat whine s$&@!,The eating part seemed real to me. The rest seemed fabricated for a book deal. There are better ways to use a midlife crisis. Julia Roberts starring in the movie doesn't make this worthy of reading.
1,Terrible,This is a terrible book. The movie and book are boring and self satisfying. I felt that both were an extreme waste of my time. I hope that this helps some other people not waste theirs.
1,Disappointing,Very superficial. I lived and moved around the world and I believe this books success does only depend on marketing not on its content.
2,"Eat,Pray,Love","I am so dissapointed in this book. I normally like chick books. In fact, I'm pro-chick flics and pro-chick books, so I was surprised to find out that this books wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I haven't finished the book yet, and I don't know that I can finish it. If it gets any worse, I'm going to have to pull the plug on it. I was told that her time spent in Italy is fun, and that India is a little boring. Well, I'm still listening to her time in Italy and if India is even more boring, I know I'm going to pull the plug. Also, the narrator leaves a lot to be desired. Her reading is very dull. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book. I haven't watched the movie, but it has to be better than the book. Normally I like the book better than the movie. This may be the first case where I like the movie the best."
5,Great Reading,"Eat,Pray,Love was wonderful. Didn't want it to end. Touched parts of everyones life. Have already made plans to see the movie with an old friend. Well worth reading."
4,Cuts to the Chase!,"Elizabeth Gilbert cuts to the chase as far as life is concerned in Rome. Her cynicism is a good anti-dote to much of the syrup and sugar that surrounds many books written about living in Italy. I am the author of a similar book called Somewhere South of Tuscany and understand that sometimes beneath the sense of wonderment for Italians and their life style, there is often something a little less appealing and more real, always lurking to trip you up! Brava Elizabeth!Diana Armstrong"
2,Wah wah,"I can't imagine what this woman would do if she ever had something truly bad happen to her. A divorce? A failed affair? Oh, please. I concur with the reviewers who object to her whiny self-absorption. This was recommended to me by a person who is REALLY in a horrible divorce and she loved it, but I find it tedious.There are so many people who are brave in the face of real tragedy, I just want to say to this person, ""Suck it up.""She is a pretty good writer, nice imagery, when she is not busy looking in the existential mirror that is her life."
4,Book Review,"Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and IndonesiaThis is an amusing, interesting account of a woman's travel across the world to find herself and heal from her depression and bitter divorce.She is funny and open and honest as she experiences different cultures and finds peace and happiness.I enjoyed this book. She appeared on Oprah and she is cute and funny.Judy"
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"Ive read many books throughout my whole life, some i liked and some i couldnt get through. This book is so pure and insightful; i could not put it down! It holds some of the most amazing wisdom and beliefs. I found enlightenment throught the book, and no matter what race, religion, you may be, I blieve the stories and wisdom can still apply. Everyone in the world could benefit from reading this book, and oh how different our world would be if everyone trusted in these views! I have to say it is so far the most awesomely fantastic books i have read so far!"
1,"The Priviledged Eat, Pray, Love",This book implies that it takes a great deal of money to find God and love. Ms. Gilbert's self deprecating humor is slickly described with pop references and descriptors and doesn't feel authentic -- more like the rehearsings of one who knows there is a paycheck and has never scratched and hungered. One wonders if Ms. Gilbert is capable of truly feeling deeply or can only pretend to feel deeply. Quite disappointing.
2,Self Induglent,"Pretty much self indulgent blather. Upset that the ratings were so high that I bought it! No one wants to hear that much about HER except HER. I tried to get what I could out of it but there was almost nothing I wasn't already aware of, being touch with myself in the least already. It got the second star for a few parts I was able to get into a little bit, I was desperate to feel like I paid for SOMETHING.Audiobook note: I think the audio was recorded in such a way that she's talking very softly or something, it's maddening. I needed to switch to music periodically for reprieve."
2,"Eat, Pray, Love","While the book is well written and sometimes amusing, it has an overall air of arrogance and self-indulgence. It covers a lifestyle no one should want to copy. After a while, the whole thing becomes sickening."
4,great!!!,I was very happy with the service and the quick shipment of the book I ordered. I would certainly order from there again. Thanks so much.
1,sad,"I think it is so sad that so many women read and got inspiration from this book. What is happening to the minds of our women? It's like people will just grab at anything!! I had a very hard time finishing the book, but did and was so mad at the time I wasted doing so. I guess this woman is typical of the thinking of the weak, lost and ignorant!"
5,LOVED IT!,I read this book after I checked it out from the library and loved it SO much that I had to buy it for my collection. It is one you will read again and again. There are so many sensible life lessons to remember and go back to that you will need to use a highlighter pen. It is a treat to linger over and savor- a very special gift to your spiritual self!
4,Thought Provoking,"This book not only keeps you entertained throughout but is very thought provoking as well. She writes with a quick wit and sense of humor that, although the subject matter is sometimes rather deep and serious, you can't help but chuckle all the way through it. It leaves you thinking about what you've read long after you've closed the book for that day. I found myself thinking, ""I'll just finish this chapter and then go do ............"" whatever, but before I knew it, I'd be in the middle of the next chapter and completely forgot to close the book and go ""do whatever""! Well worth the read! Can't wait to see if the movie lives up to the book.Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia"
4,Surprisingly a great read!,"I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this book or not...I don't read much non-fiction and I don't think I have ever read a memoir. I really did enjoy reading this book. I enjoyed reading about Italy and Indonesia the best (India got boring at times to me). I think it is a wonderful story about a women's search for happiness and contentment. It really shows that a women can do ANYTHING she puts her mind to (with or without a man I might add) and that wherever you may be in life there is always a way to change it and always another life book to open.I think I am at a time in my life where I am turning a new page in my life book and I am trying to figure out what I want my new chapter to be about. I think I may have enjoyed this book more because I am at this time in my life. I would have hated this book if I would have read it at 21, but at 28 and marrried with no children yet...it was perfect!"
4,Good value.,The book arrived in a very timely fasion and in the condition specified. I needed this book for my book club and am very glad to have gotten it at a reduced price and on time for me to read it before our meeting. Thank you!
1,completely boring and selfish,"i couldn't get even halfway through this. this woman is so completely selfish, i'm embarrassed for her. don't bother buying this...or even reading it."
5,"Borrowed E,P,L. from a friend then ordered my own copy","You'd have to know what a cheapskate I can be and that I almost NEVER read a book a second time -- even when I tell myself I will -- to know what a huge deal it is for me to buy a hardcover copy of a book I've already read. That's how much I loved the book.Elizabeth Gilbert is just a flat-out wonderful writer. Any story she has to tell would be worth reading, it seems to me. Her voice grabbed me at the start and I literally could not put down the book. I read it over two days and was racing the clock to finish it on Sunday night so I could discuss it over dinner with the friend I'd borrowed it from.Many people who've posted here have done a wonderful job of encapsulating the basic premises of this book. I'll just had that this book has the wonderful, indescribableness of Anne Lamott's nonfiction. You learn so much, you laugh so much, you feel so much. All the joys of reading are here. Highly recommended!"
1,"yak, yak, yakkitty yak.... blah blah","Oh God, based on the popularity of this book and recccommendations from female friedns, I sat down to read this book....I gave up after the first 35 pages this summer. Tried to resume this winter and I give up yet again......the author just goes yakitty yak, it's all talk, like she's holding a microphone to her mind and transcribing her scattered thoughts. Nothing in it for me in this book, sorry :(its not a comedy or a tragedy or a travelogue or a spiritual of a romantic book....it's just endless rambling."
1,Self-Absorbtion to the extreme,"I read this book on the recommendation of my mother...and have rediscovered why I never listen to her advice. I kept waiting for this idiotic author to discover that if she wasn't so into herself, perhaps her life would be better, but it never happened. I did enjoy the Italy section (as the food sounds great), but honestly if I met this woman while she was traveling I would have smacked her upside the head. Her time and money would have been better spent on charity work then this driveling 'look how much i've improved myself' egocentric excuse of a book. Don't waste your money."
1,Save your money for gas,"I am only on page 27 and cannot go any further. This lady does not seem to be on a 'journey' on her own, especially if she just goes from one man to the next. She whines too **** much. Get over yourself already."
2,"Entertaining, if anything else.","My sister gave me the book after she read it because she said she was ""touched by it."" Well, having suffered from a 3-year episode of depression myself, I can certainly sympathize with the author -- depression is indeed horrible. However, I didn't have the luxury of dropping everything in my life, to go and travel and write about my experience. I had to just ""buck up"" and accept that I was no exception; EVERYONE has issues and must learn to deal with them as part of life. Now, I have to admit that I didn't hate the book, in fact I enjoyed most of it, but mostly because of the other (much more interesting) people that Liz meets in her travels -- like Richard from Texas -- I LOVED this character. I only hope he comes out with his own book soon!"
2,Ramble on.....,Moments of like and dislike. She tends to ramble on and on. The book starts to get really good and just like that...it's over. Probably wouldn't read again.
4,Interesting Read,"I ordered the book after seeing Elizabeth Gilbert on the Oprah Show. I am finding the book fasinating, however it does not keep ones attention like most of the books that Oprah has recommended. I am in section two where Elizaeth is in India and as I continue to read I do hope that the book will hold my interest a bit more as she continues on her journey towards spiritually."
3,2.5 out of 5--Average,"For the same reason I read The Da Vinci Code (namely, peer pressure), I finally read Eat, Pray, Love, Elizabeth Gilbert's bestselling memoir about her culinary and spiritual journey following a messy divorce. I have no major complaints about this book, but I also have nothing particularly positive to say. It's exactly what you'd expect: typical and predictable but also easy to read and somewhat entertaining. As Gilbert traipses across Italy, India, and Indonesia, her lighthearted tone keeps her story from wallowing in seriousness, but it also introduces a veneer of superficiality. If you like these kinds of books (thirty-something woman rediscovers the joys of life), you'll probably enjoy Eat, Pray, Love. Personally, I'd rather spend my time reading something more unique."
5,Better than expected,"After hearing the hype on this book, I was prepared to be disappointed. However, this book exceeded all of my expectations. It is a quick read, and the author offers so much of herself in these pages that, by the end, you will think she's a friend of yours!"
4,"""On My Bucket List""",It wasn't my favorite book but it was fun reading. Sometimes we all at one point in our lives want to run away from our problems. If only I had the money...then come home to my loving family.
2,Whiny book,"Was not too impressed. The first section on Italy was great. By the time she got to India, I was so completely over her whining, which carried into Indonesia, and became quickly annoyed. All of a sudden, she was ""over it"" and the end was ""I'm re-married now, read about it in my next book."" Uh...."
1,pathetic,"I started to read it last summer due to a book group choice. Couldn't pass the italian chapter. What a bratt!!! I just couldn't stand her selfpittying and ""I am so Pretty, oh so pretty"" approach. I started to want to write to her husband and tell him how much of a great guy he was, even if I didn't know anything about him.Well, the reason why I am writting this is because I found an incredible book to read, especially by EVERYONE who tried to read EAT PRAY...I just finished the Glass Castle,so I understand why women in search of evasion would read EAT PRAy... But if you truly want to cherish your life and see how fortunate you are, just read the Glass Castle. Complete opposite. It will make you ashame of self pittying (is that a word?).If you still want to dream or escape, you are better off watching the cooking channel or Discovery or Travel....I am stunned EAT PRAY... is a best seller. She doesn't deserve it!"
1,Skip it,CS Quinn said it much better than I ever could. Not even worth borrowing for curiosity sake. Author's metaphysics is much lacking in morality from a Christian perspective.
2,Too deep into the Chick Lit genre.,"The travel experiences she describes, both spiritual and culinary are fun. HOWEVER, if you have girlfriends that are annoyingly complicated about relationships and you find their rants make you lose your will to live until they're finished, then skip this book. Wait for the Lifetime channel movie."
2,Why all the hype?,"Not quite what I was expecting! I found it to be a little self-indulgent, however I did relate to a lot of her emotions (I wonder what that says about me?!). I read this as part of a book club, and only 1 out of 8 of us actually finished it in time - not really a page turner."
4,Thank you!,"I just finished Eat, Pray, Love last night, after a friend gave me the book months ago, it took me a passport to get through India. Loved Italy, and Indonesia. I found Ms. Gilbert's work to be witty, clever, and attentive to detail. I could visualize each character in her book, as well as each circumstance. The journey taken with Ms. Gilbert was a fantastic one, filled with laughter and tears. I would recommend this book to anyone. A great read, just need a little patience in India, after all meditation is the focus there, and God knows, we all need patience for that. Just wanted to say thanks for making me laugh, and feel inspired and brave."
5,journey,"This is a wonderful, insightful, emotional, and spiritual journey of a life in crisis to a meaningful life. Full of humor, almost as if you are traveling with her side by side. Highly recommended just to enjoy her journey or to relate with her spiritually."
1,eaten prayed and madly in love with herself,"Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and IndonesiaThis author is the most self-absorbed person I've ever encountered. Reading her I ME I ME prose is nauseating."
3,Mixed Reaction,"I liked parts of this memoir and was disappointed by other parts. I liked the author's narrative voice. There are lots of interesting bits of trivia - the bit about prayer beads, for example. In the section on India, I thought there was too much fluff about her Texan friend and his nickname for her ""Groceries"". It would have been more effective to have just one anecdote about that. As for Bali, I really enjoyed the unfolding of her relationship with Wayan and Tutti. I thought the road trip section could have been omitted. I have read some other reviews and I think I will try ""A Thousand Days in Venice""."
1,Nice cover and that's about it,"Poor little rich girl travels to 3 different countries, eats, laughs, buys underwear. A total bore-fest. It was a struggle to get through this book. Always hoping there would be some substance, but it never appeared. How did this ever get published?!"
1,duh,"This book is full of subjective point of views and a lot of them aren't true. I am so annoyed by the author's ignorance and conceited attitude in the book. Moreover, The author seems like to reapeat same idea over and over again for a whole page. Honestly, I don't think I would be interested in her self-dstruct life style with boy-crazy problems througout the book."
1,Trivial Pursuit,"It's hard to believe that this book is number one on the NY Times best seller list! But, then again, in a land of ghost-written bios and diet books, I guess it shouldn't be surprising. Skimming the surface, sound-bites, New Age narcissism, they're all here folks and Ms. Gilbert is a master juggler. It's amazing to me how folks like this can skate along on the surface of life, collecting book advances, multiple homes, spiritual ""experiences"", book contracts and new relationships and, at the end of it, still be as clueless as the Pillsbury Dough Boy. I am so grateful that I read this at the library, rather than buy it and be responsible for funding Ms.Gilbert's next excursion. She and Sara Davidson should take a trip through Third World countries together...now THAT would be an interesting read! Hey,who stole my blow dryer! oy gevalt."
2,A Lesson in Self Absorption,"This book was a gift to me so thankfully I didn't spend my own money on it. Normally I don't read self help or ""soul searching"" type of books so I guess that's part of the reason I didn't like this book. I found it to be a chronicle of a well to do woman's journey of ""finding herself"" only on a huge budget. She decides she doesn't want to be married anymore and takes off for exotic places to figure out what she should do with her life. Now some of it I admit was interesting especially the India experience with the culture, meditation, yoga, etc. But it was really hard for me to identify with this author and find any empathy with her."
1,Under the Tuscan Sun without charm or creativity,"Awful. The whining, narcissistic author's husband and boyfriend leave her. She is depressed. She eats a lot and gains weight. Don't buy it there is nothing new here."
1,Waste of time,"I love spiritual journeys and all, but this was painful to read, not particularly well written, and unbelievably self centered. I made it about three quarters of the way through the book before I gave up."
5,"Engaging, memorable, inspiring","I loved this book. I bought it after seeing the author on Oprah and loved her approach to life. I was inspired by her desire to search for peace through a spiritual path and her ability to look at herself honestly and with love. Because I share this desire, I felt a special kinship with her from the very beginning. I was sad to finish the book because it felt like I was losing touch with an old friend. I am anxious to read other books by Liz Gilbert."
5,"Read, mull, spew?",Why does the story of one woman's journey inspire so much angst? Maybe for the same reason most of us haven't yet learned to respect an opinion (and the opinion giver) that differs from our own. Of course she's imperfect for Pete's sake...she's human! And she wrote a book many people have enjoyed reading. What is so terrible about that?
5,Inspiring...,"This is an excellent book. I was lucky enough to meet Elizabeth Gilbert at a live author event in Bellingham WA. I am in my mid 40's, going through a marriage of 23 years ending. Her book inspired me that you can heal and explore so much that the world has to offer if you open your heart & soul up to the possibilites. A wonderful book from a awesome woman on a amazing journey of self discovery & healing plus adventure."
1,self absorbed,"Anyone with a good editor, money and freedom for a year could write this book. blah, blah, blah. I couldn't get over how self indulgent the author sounded. And they made a movie of this trash!"
1,Zero stars,"Can I give this book zero stars? I read it for a book group, otherwise I'd have quit reading it after Italy. Like many other reviewers I found the author shallow and whiney. I am amazed that she could write a whole book about learning to rely on herself and then rhapsodize in the end about the new man who validates her existence. What a waste of paper!!!!"
1,Extreme narcissim,"I was flabergasted at the lack of sensitivity this woman portrayed toward others thoughts and practices. Frankly, I wanted to laugh at what she considers suffering. At times when she described having to go to a cold bathroom floor and beg ""God"" to help her escape the misery of her poor life. How many people could only wish for a cold bathroom floor and in Manhattan no less. Very self absorbed and pitiful. 0 stars !"
1,very dissapointed,"This book is such a dissapointment that I actually stopped reading on page 25. this self-centered woman spent her first 6 chapters talking about nothing but personal relationship disasters-- the question is, who care? which reader wants to learn about her ugly divorce and her unsuccessful dating stories? I was so irritated and annoyed by it I actually stopped continueing it.Don't get this book, it's a waste of your time."
4,It's Really Not That Bad,"It seems that this book really struck a chord with people. Judging by all the negative reviews, a dissonant one. Yes, this book seems contrived and somewhat of an exercise in self-absorption, but the writing is pretty decent and it did hold my interest. It's obvious the author is doing something right because I read that they're making this into a feature film."
4,Just the right book for people looking for spiritual direction.,"This book had a very interesting point of view. I found it to contain some good ideas for looking for a new spiritual experience. It had some fun, light moments, too, as well as some neat travel information. However, it isn't for everyone, just the open-minded."
1,What's all the hype?,"This book was really disappointing. Don't waste your time. It's a woe is me story, poor thing, have pity. Maybe I missed something."
5,I love this book!,I have not put it down since I started this book. I can't believe I did not read this sooner.
1,Too political for me,"I was really looking forward to this book. My excitement for it ended in the first chapter she stated the worst thing in life would be if one of her children were to come home and say they were a republican! I wasn't looking for a politcal book - I was wanting to read a warm, funny, touching story. I found it to be written without morals and if this is the opinions of most single women today - we are in a world of hurt. I didn't finish it. It was revolting."
1,Eat pray love,Good I enjoyed itMade me think a little deeper I not me and my thoughts. I would recommend it.
1,I never get it!!!!!!!,"Ok, i dont really know what heck is wrong with my purchase and infact i never get that book since the day i purchased it!!!!!!!!!!! I will not recommend people to purchase anything from this seller and i'd better get an explaination as soon as possible!!!!"
1,Topical nonsense,"I was quite disappointed with this book. It may be of interest to women with similar ""issues"" as the author, but,for me, it was like trudging through the desert, looking for an oasis (which I never found).I wish I had known the religious orientation prior to my purchase. Not my style."
2,"Should be retitled ""Laugh, B***H and Moan""","While Ms. Gilbert has a wonderful sense of humor, it is buried beneath self pity and complaining. Her story is a search for God which I believe may of us go through in our life. Unfortunately Gilbert's journey is rife with indulgent self analysis that few people can relate to.I know too many people that have faced and conquered truly life shattering events and not only survived but extablished a relationship with God that is remarkable.I read this book with my book club and I am eager to see if anyone has the same reaction as mine."
2,Not that Great,"I was really disappointed in this book. I had great expectations, but I have to agree with some others that the constant whining and crying was hard to take. I don't feel as though she achieved any level of enlightenment, as it seemed more important to convey her very judgmental comments regarding ALL Republicans. It sounds like she is more of an immature Democratic tifoso. The Dr. Phil type character at the Ashram was so grating that I couldn't wait for him to go home!! The charitable inclination to help the family in Bali would have been admirable if she had not used it to write a best-seller. I do wish her the best on her spiritual journey."
5,Ultimate Chick Book,Come on people - this is a fantastic bookIt is the ultimate chick bookI loved it 100% every chapterAnd This woman can write and makes you laughLighten up. Read it.
1,"Eat, Pray Love One womans search for everything",I would gladly like to give you a good review but I have not received mybook yet.Ordered it in Early Dec 2007 and here it is jan 07 2008 and no book. Please look into this matter for meThank youLouis MacKay
4,"Eat, Pray,Love",I have always loved Barbar Kingsolver's books and this is no exception. The book deals with the family living with minimal outside resources.
4,Add my voice to the chorus of fans,"This is a book about ecstatic experiences -- eating, feeling infused by God, and falling in love. What's not to like about it?Gilbert does get a bit sentimental at points, and her multiple, vague uses of the ""God"" notion do annoy a tiny bit -- and she also uses ""so"" in place of ""very,"" as in ""I loved it SO much,"" which hit my buttons as an English teacher -- but boy, are these small complaints about a book so full of heart that it makes you feel like you're with a friend the whole time you're reading it.I know everyone on Earth has probably read this book already, but if you haven't, give yourself a treat and pick up a copy. I just loved it."
1,I never received this book. I ordered it but it never came,"I need you to check to see what happened to my Eat, Live, Pray.I never received it."
3,The book I just received,It was a cheap deal but the book had been written in and highlighted and I would have appreciated knowing that and would have paid more for one that was not written in.
1,One star is too many!,"This book was *terrible*. The author has got to be the most self-absorbed narcissist I have ever read. In a world where so many people are struggling with illness, hunger, disabilities, war, it is painful to read this narrative of self-indulgent self-pity. I cannot believe people actually like this book! It was torture to read."
2,Could have been interesting...,"Like many other reviewers, I couldn't make it past page 50 or so. I really wanted to like this book - everyone I know who read it, loved it. I had to wait months to get it from the library (so glad I didn't spend a dime on it!). However, when I finally sat down to read it, I couldn't believe how immature Ms. Gilbert came across. She babbles on and on about her ""problems"". Give me a break. Look around lady, people have far greater problems than you and they don't have the $$ to travel the world to ""find themselves"".The premise of this book had potential, but that was overshadowed by Ms. Gilbert's self absorbed personality.I found this book to be soooo lame."
1,very disappointing,"The hype sold me. The book is very boring. After two-thirds read, I realized that the author might need help, rather than giving it."
1,Would not recommend,"I liked the beginning, and the part about Italy, but she comes across as really into how great she is. Doesn't seem to notice her surroundings or how she impacts others. I didn't like it."
2,"Sadly, No.","I don't get it. What is all the hype about? The author seems very naive and uneducated, especially considering she is almost a decade older than me. I found the book so frustrating and irritating that I couldn't read past the first of the three sections. All of the characters she described in her book were annoying- they reminded me of characters from a cheesy teenager movie. The book is promoted as an insightful and spiritual coming of age book but don't let the hype fool you. The book is simply boring and inane ""chick-lit."" I normally enjoy reading about other peoples' travels. Judging from this book, she is definitely not someone I would want to travel with if I were to go to Italy, India, and Indonesia."
5,Delicious,"This book is beautiful and inspiring. It leaves me hungry to explore life and other cultures. I get lost in the countries traveled, and live these expereinces with the writer in pure bliss. A wonderfully written story, which I will read many times."
1,Inauthentic...,"I found this book disappointing and really difficult to finish. The author's self-absorbed voice was a major turn-off. Everything was about ""me, me me"", even though she purports to be on a spiritual journey to ""find herself."" What was really laughable was the part when the author becomes ""spiritually enlightened"" in India. From what I know as an Indian Hindu it supposedly takes hundreds of births to achieve samadhi and the people I've seen that are even anywhere on that path are all about altruism, kindness and a simple lifestyle, not self-indulgence. This self-absorbed author claims she reached it in what, 2 weeks? There is no express ""microwave"" enlightenment that can be achieved simply because you have the money and feeling of entitlement to do it. However, I give her an extra star for her writing style which is somewhat appealing."
1,"Readable, but not worth reading","The book has some decent moments, but overall it is banal, narcissistic, and self-indulgent. There are better travel stories to be had, and much better personal growth chronicles. Note to author: there's a big difference between self-reflection and self-absorption."
1,Obnoxious,"Elizabeth Gilbert is an annoying person and spending time with her world view made my IQ drop.Overall, she is trite, vain and self-centered. The most pretentious part of the book was the visit to India when she found God-- her multi-cultural, hippy drippy God-- again and again. Right.I wish I had not wasted my time on this drivel."
1,eat pray and recycle,"I can't even bring myself to give this book to charity.. it took me several months of really trying to get into it.. when eventually at the pitiful page of 80 I gave up.. eat, pray and be completed bored and fed-up.. life can be disappointing at the best of times.. reading a book to get this feeling isn't something I feel the need to do.. it felt like a monologue of twaddle. may this book be recycled into something more useful."
1,This book is so not worth the read,"I was excited when I got the book since I love learning about new cultures and food. The book could have been shorted to 3 chapters. Italy was not bad but her experience in India was rather monotonous. Don't even get me started on Indonesia. The part of her story where she tried to ""help"" the woman by raising money from her friends and family and then dictating to the woman how she should use it, felt narcissitic to me. Overall I am very disappointed with the book."
2,Glib and Shallow,"Gilbert writes well: the prose keeps the reader moving along through her adventures in middle-aged angst, and she is entertaining. But the book is supposed to take us through her personal growth and self-discovery, and I was left with the distinct impression that she finished her journeys every bit as self-involved and self-indulgent as she had started them. The people she encounters are two dimensional, either foils or backdrops (or both), and if there is any depth of feeling she developed, it is lost in her witticisms. A quick, light read, but disappointing."
4,"Eat, Love, Pray: Every Woman's Search",I really enjoyed this book. The author made it so easy to share and understand the many phases a woman has in her life. I could relate to this woman and felt that she looked inside me and shared many thoughts and emotions that I have had.
2,Depressing.,"I couldn't get through this book, I felt depressed after reading the first half. I also felt like it was really slow paced. Maybe it's too close to my heart because I'm getting married soon, and nobody getting married wants to read about people falling out of love with their spouse.I thought it would be different, but I was disappointed."
2,why did i read this whole book?,"I think it must have been because of the supershort chapters. I would never recommend it though. This woman obviously finds herself hilarious and enlightened. I admit, I did learn some interesting things about Italian and Indonesian culture. But I have to wonder how relevant it would be for a real person traveling and not some phony seeming (just my opinion) woman who is traveling just for the sake of traveling. Of course as someone who's never written a successful book this is all easy for me to say but I do read a lot and I am telling you- don't waste your time. Ugh it is so trite and predictable and I spent most of the time rolling my eyes. As I said I did finish the book so something about it must have compelled me forward but as I write this I can't quite put my finger on it."
5,Finding Peace...AMAZING,"This was an amazing book. It was just what I needed to read. I am struggling myself about where the world should take me. Life is way to short and there is so much to see. I loved her writing style. I found myself laughing out loud at times and thinking about my own struggles with meditation. Great book, fast read. I want to meet all the people she met along her trip and ask them so many questions."
5,Loved it!,"How could anyone claim that the book lacked substance!Read it and then judge it! I personally loved it especially the ""Pray"" part!"
2,Couldn't finish it...,"... cause it was just plain naive! I don't want to give it 1 star because parts of it at least made me interested. But overall (until I stoped reading it)this book really didn't do it for me. I think first of all it was too spiritual to suit me and secondly I got really annoyed with the selfishness of Gilbert. I blame myself for the second part though - I should have realized that reading some other reviews and given the fact that the book is about one woman's life crisis. However I just found it bland and annoying. The part in Italy was ok (I think that this is because I have lived in Rome myself before) but it is the India part that made me give this book away. So many people recommended this book to me and I would too... if the person in question is really spiritual, to me it just got wierd."
2,Terrible Read,"I fell to the scepticism that surely if they made a movie about this book, it must be a great read. I have yet to see the movie and chose to read the book first.... much to my disappointment! I have been trying to finish it for 3 weeks now and cannot get into at all. I can hardly believe it made the best sellers list! I feel the author is terribly conceded in my opinion. I am not sure I will even waste time on the movie."
1,poor quality product,"the writing itself is wonderful, no doubt. It's the quality of the book I have a problem with. Usually Amazon is the best. However this book is falling apart by the day. The binding is a misnomer as it binds NOTHING. I have a handful of pages."
2,Not what I thought,"I read most of the reviews about this book, saw the author on TV, listen to my friends rave about it...but honestly it wasn't very good. It took me ages to get through and I found for the first time in my life skipping pages in order to finish it (or get over the really boring, overly wordy, insignificant parts)!!! I would not recommend the book..."
1,"Check this book out of your library, but don't buy it","There are already over 200 negative reviews of this book, so I don't know that I have much to add, except that my main reason for disliking the book is that I didn't find the author very likable. First off, this trip is all expenses paid by her book publisher, so that took away some of her credibility for me. Secondly, I just found her a bit too braggy and self absorbed to truly appreciate her stories. I hope the author is a nicer, more humble person in reality than she comes across in this book."
2,It's just ok.,"First off, you have to be in the right ""mood"" to read this book. If you're not up for reading about one neurotic woman's self-absorbed, ""spiritual"" journey to find her ""self"", then don't. Oftentimes, I feel like I'm listening to a self-pitying girlfriend talk endlessly about her life, which can get on anyone's nerves, no?However, I can see how many people can identify with her also. At some point in everyone's life, one always seeks out the spiritual. I like that Gilbert doesn't get preachy about her quest and is quite self-deprecating. But, I do think that this book is way overrated and not suitable for everyone. If you want to live vicariously through a woman who was lucky enough to be able to spend a whole year seeking for ""betterment"", this is the book for you. It might also be a good vacation read."
2,New title suggestion,"I think this book is more appropriately titled ""Me, Me, Me."" It's a very self-centered story. Two stars because she does share interesting details and descriptions about the places she travels."
5,"Yeah, but what about the rest of us?","""Eat, Pray, Love"" really made me want to find my ""light,"" to travel, to be able to explore and meet more people, but unfortunately I am constrained by a job, family responsibilities, and financial limitations. I realize that this was not a ""how to"" book necessarily, but in a way it becomes that as I related to the content in many ways--I wanted to go to Italy and play, I wanted to go to the Ashram and learn to meditate and find God, and I wanted to go to Bali and ride a bicycle and enjoy peace and tranquility.But I can't do all of this in reality. So the book was excellent in that it created this image so strongly I felt I could be in Liz's shoes and imagined how it would be like through her wonderfully, descriptive imagery."
4,Book Review,"I find the author witty and although I didi not like the movie, I thought the book waswell written."
3,Entertaining,"Elizabeth Gilbert is really funny in this book, especially the ""eat"" and ""love"" part. The ""pray"" part was a bit slow for me."
1,Waste of money,"I just wanted to gag throughout the first quarter of the book. Never made it past her trip to Italy. Did you ever just want to punch a character in the face? That is how I felt with every turn of the page. Then to find out this wasn't her taking a risk in life by going on a journey of self discovery, she was sponsored by a publisher to find herself - in other words, get paid to ""experience"" crap that you can twist into a plot and sell to the ugly masses. Shame on me for being a consumer and buying the hype. Refused to watch the movie, even when it was free on a plane because I was still upset with wasted my money on the book."
1,If only I could be so depressed...,"If you have ever struggled in your life at all, you cannot relate to this woman. If everyone in the world had her problems we would be living in a utopia."
1,Bestsellers are not necessarily the best,"They sell! People recommend them. Gilbert is here on target. She is a NOW WRITER. She fills the expectations of a fast read tackling current ""Inside Edition""-similar info on affluent modern women's woes. But her road to finding herself is painful,redundant and finally kitsch-like. A pity, since she is talented. Before her search to find herself she should have put the bestselling philosopher David Precht in her purse. Reading encouraging Amazon reviews, I may, however, give her previous book ""An American Man"" a chance."
5,Inspirational and Soul Searching,"Another book that I read and keep going back to. Incredibly inspirational and dare I say - deep. If you read beyond the top level stuff. Elizabeth Gilbert accurately chronicles her journey and the courage it took to find and listen to her own voice and then follow it, step by step. The movie was also good, but this book has all the rich stuff in it. I keep going back to it - I've earmarked special pages - especially the quote at the very end (which should have been included in the movie because it sums up the book!) when she's talking about the parts of her that she doesn't like so much - ""I love you. I will never ever leave you. I will always take care of you"" What a beautiful inspiration on how to live life and treat yourself kindly. Highly recommend for all women who are searching for their path in life."
2,I just don't understand the hype,"I really didn't care for this book. I was so looking forward to it, I really was. It was just so drawn out....I just about gave up when the book gets to India. AND as someone who loves India and lived there for nearly year that is saying a lot. The beginning is okay. The middle is way too long, and the end is quite humorous. I loved the parts in Bali. That being said I don't think it was worth reading through the 1st two parts of the book to get there."
2,too self centered to be of interest to anyone but the author,"If you know Ms. Glibert personally perhaps you will enjoy this work as a way to understand the writer a little better. For the rest of us: it reads as the all America ego trip and stands as a perfect illustration as to why we are considered bad/poor (but rich) world travelers.The writing was juvenile in its metaphors, similies and imagery and it was more of a first person lecture than it was a story or a personal observation of life.I didn't hate it as much as others; probably, because i didn't have high expectations to begin with."
2,"Eat, Pray, Love",I couldn't connect with this book. The author rambled on about the first part of the book for too many chapters. The second and third part was readable. Don't know why everyone raved over it.I would'nt recommend it.
2,"eat ,pray, love","Not my kind of book, Character was too self involved. Couldn't relate to character or her life style. How many people can break away and travel for that long: very few I expect. All she talked was about herself. I rather hear about the places and the people more."
3,Interesting...,"I finally caved in to the tsunami of Oprah-bred hype and read this book - under duress by various females of my acquaintance. Expecting the usual literary self-help panacea, I was thrilled to discover a writer of some insight and wit...during the first two sections. I must confess, however, that I began to lose patience with the author during the the final third of the book for she succumbed to the temptation to rely on the trite, the hackneyed and the ""quick-fix"" tools that are too often employed by those who simply tire of their subject matter. Great beginning but a limping finale."
3,Interesting enough...,"This was a pretty interesting read and yes, I was a little skeptical about it based on the comments here but it turned out to be quite entertaining. Journeying through the lives of others always seems to capture my attention. I just wish Oprah would stop being so frivolous with her recommendations."
3,well it started off great,"A friend highly recommended this book. I LOVED the section on Italy... dreamlife - learn Italian and eat for a few months, yes I will keep that in mind if I ever hit rock bottom and have the money. The India trip didn't quite connect with me. Richard from Texas made that part worth reading. And the Bali trip was interesting from a cultural perspective, but by this stage I was seriously wondering what in the world she was doing by now.This author can describe feelings in such a vivid manner I have a hard time believing. Initially it makes for a good read, then it becomes a little over the top. It was a different type book from the usual murder mysteries I read so I still enjoyed it."
2,Disappointing,"With all the hype and a long wait at the library, I expected more. I loved the author's style and her ability to laugh at herself. I love words too, as she obviously does--in many language--and I loved when she gave the history of their origins. That said, she was so self-absorbed, and I wasn't much interested in all the navel-gazing. Skip section two."
1,one woman's self obsessed rantings,"I bought this book thinking it was about someone's search for meaning. It turns out this woman is just really really self absorbed. I can get this kind of trash from reading the celebrity mags. My advice to her, pick yourself up and get a life; there are millions of people out there with REAL problems."
1,whining drivel,"wouldn't it be great if we could all divorce our husbands, get a fat advance, and travel the world for a year ""finding ourselves"" in our 30's? i found the book obnoxious and i wish the author would grow the hell up."
3,a certain level of emotional intelligence is required,"I would only recommend this book to women who can relate to the author's personal life. If you are happily married suburban soccer mom, don't read it. You will find it it irritating and narcissistic. Gilbert doesn't try to put down marriage, she only says that it didn't work for her anymore, which is very personal. And that is the book's tone - subjective and personal.So if you don't view life in black and white tones and have been through a traumatic experience (I would consider divorce to be such), I would definitely recommend it to you."
1,Ugh,"The ultimate ""Me"" book, me, me, me, me. Ummm, on second thought it's the ultimate ""I"" book. Just look at how many times ""I"" appears."
4,Interesting angle of women travel,"She's a wonderful writer, great story teller, God bless her. But as a similarly aged woman who traveled on her own around the world, everyone naturally now compares me to her story and assumes I ""had a romp around the world."" Can we just clear up the fact that not all women are in search of love and men while traveling? Thank you. There are many reasons people/women go traveling, maybe meeting men is one of them. And perhaps ""finding yourself"" is another -- but most women are going to discover how the world ticks and stretch their own comfort zones. Thank you for the entertaining story, Elizabeth."
3,"Interesting Idea, Bad Writing","I originally picked up this book because of the interesting story plot, and while I still think the story was pretty interesting, the writing style just didn't cut it. I didn't feel as if anything was flowing right, and the book simply didn't grasp my attention. I finished it because I hate starting books and not finishing them, but I have to admit I continued reading the book with such dread it was like a homework assignment. I did appreciated the acknowledgement of different cultures. The main character whined the entire book and somehow I just couldn't bring myself to actually feel sorry for her because she was so annoying. I wouldn't really reccomend this book to anyone looking for a captivating read."
4,I wouldn't have bought it for myself...but enjoyed it,"This is not the type of book I would have bought for myself. However, my mom gave it to me for Christmas and I found it difficult to put down. It did get a little long and sluggish in the middle, but I'm glad I finished it."
4,One woman's journey,"I loved this book. In the beginning I found it hard to get into but once I got to India it was fablous. My favorite character was Richard. There were so many ""points"" brought out in this book. The book is about a woman who is trying to find herself after a failed marriage and relationship and the strength and courage she had to pick herself up and go on this self perserving journey. The author did a great job in describing all of the characters and gave you a sense of who they truly were. The ending was a little disappointing but since it is based on a true story you can't change the facts. Would definitely recommend the book"
5,Inspirational work,"This is the most enjoyable book I have read in a long time. Elizabeth Gilbert writes in a flowing, descriptive and amusing style. I found myself even laughing outloud at times! Her story is inspiratonal and her writing is superb. I was sorry to reach the end of this book ! I recommend it to all who enjoy travel, personal growth and adventure."
4,"Gilbert, the woman next door,","Gilbert, is the woman next door, or at least what the woman next door wants to do - be a globe trotter who eats, prays and loves."
2,"Tough Life, Baby","I found this book to be a reasonably well written journey of a completely self-absorbed woman who sounds like most unhappy people who have little reason to be unhappy. Then, image the woe of being paid to travel for a year and think only of yourself and how hard your life is. Ugh."
3,"It's okay, but not great","Did not understand all of the hype about this book, let alone the movie. Book is good, but so very self-indulgent and in many respects depicts author as immature and selfish. If this is what it takes to ""find oneself"" today in your 30's, then watch out for midlife!!"
5,Wonderfully honest and....,".....engaging. Very refreshing....as refreshing as non-fiction can be. Well articulated. Theforthrightness of the Author's feelings made this book readable to the end. Although I am have not yet experienced this wonderful thing we call marraige, I know how it feels to be unfufilled despite the things that surround you. I find it bold of author Elizabeth Gilbert to explore and find fufillment for the one person you should live your life for at some point in your life....you. (Most of us experience this before marriage and a baby) Let this be a lesson to all of you who have found a million reasons to stay, all the while dying inside as a stranger stares back at you from the mirror, when only one is needed to leave. Men do it all the time. Love Yourself!Lisa Eve, Author""Unforgiven"" and ""Innate Sacrifices"" (coming soon)"
5,Under 35 and female,"Maybe the demographic for this book, should be considered, but this book amazing. Very enjoyable. Don't be fooled by other reviews if you are under 35 and female you will enjoy it!"
1,Another narcissistic endeavor,"what is with all these narcissists and their books. I not only couldn't finish reading this drivel, I am returning this to amazon to get my money back. this is worse than siren's feast an edible oddessy which was also a terrible book that I managed to read 3/4s of the way through."
1,not that it matters,"not that my opinion matters because if you want to buy this book you will do so no matter what reviews you read. with that said i suggest checking this book out at your local library before you purchase it. if you can read the first 30 pages and actually find one redeeming quality then maybe this book is for you, however i will not share in that opinion. the author whines about how terrible her life is for the first half of the book and then the second half of the book, well i didn't get that far. that's how disturbed i was with her complaining (side note: all of her problems she was experiencing were self induced). maybe if the author wasn't so self absorbed the book would be palpable. all i have to say is ""boo hoo. cry me a river so i can swim in your tears."""
3,"Italy and India are OK, Indonesia is not",Deviated greatly from my reading tendencies to read this book after hearing a 'guilty pleasure' recommendation from NPR. I will know better next time.Italy and India portions of this book were OK. Indonesia digresses into a smultzy pseudo-harlequin romance. Boo.
1,a reader from Hong Kong,"It's very boring. I kept on reading hoping it will get better. until... when while in India she was conversing with her mind and calling Mediterranean sea an ocean, I could not take it any more. What a waste of time."
2,She lost the charm,"The author starts out witty and compelling in her description of her search for God in the ""I"" countries. However, in the end -- she just manages to find herself -- or herself manages to find her. What happened to God??"
3,Just ok,"I got this book because my mom and I were going to Bali, so I heard it was a good book to read before. I found it just ok. It was a bit boring and hard to get into. It got better as it went on, but I never really got into it. My mom tried to read it after me, and ended up just skipping to the Bali part because she couldn't get into it. I gave it three stars, because I like the overall story and what her journey, but I felt it could have been shorter and more intriguing! Really, I think it deserves 2.5 stars, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt!"
1,"Subtext: ""Hey Ex-husband, how ya like me now?""","I was looking forward to reading this popular book and expected something light and pleasurable. I could not suspend judgement enough to tolerate her flippant, jokey, self-absorbed insights, and hope that I can spare you from wasting a precious moment of your life reading this book. I feel like the whole book is in some way a sort of act of revenge on an ex-husband. She comes off as a narcissist. Self-promotion is her main talent."
5,as good as expected,Loved this book.Elizabeth is such an entertaining writer. I was captivated from the first page. The only complaint...why couldn't this book have existed when I was going through similar struggles 10 years ago!?!
5,My current favorite,"I'm drawn to Liz. I even find her book inspirational. Perhaps I'm at a similar point in my life, but I am comforted by her experiences and comfortable with her voice and her writing style. The book has inspired me to write more, and I'm grateful for that. I wonder if I'll find the voice of God in my own writing?"
1,TERRIBLE,"Normally, even if I hate a book, I have to finish it but Eat, Pray, Love was an exception. Terrible! So pissed that I wasted my money on it. We chose it for our book club one month because none of us had read it before, well we soon found out there was a good reason for this. The only positive thing about the part of the book I actually read was a few lines about life, depression and happiness that were well written but the rest was rubbish. Never again will I read something that Oprah has recommended. Of course she would love this book because she is a rich woman who could also easily drop everything and go on a journey to discover happiness if she so desired. Don't waste your money people! I have never written a negative review and I hope I never have to again because it doesn't feel very nice :("
2,Whining About This Book,"I wish someone can pay my way to go to Italy, India and Indonesia for a year so I can find myself and then whine about how miserable my life is in my book, which is what Gilbert got and did. This is a narcissistic memoir masked as philosophical journey to self-discovery. Gilbert should go cry a river on Paris Hilton's shoulders! She'll be in good company."
2,Hard work,This started out with great promise and sunk into too much self pity and became frustrating to read I wanted to boot her in the butt and say get a life!! Not my favourite.
1,A ridiculous fable,"The Deepest thing about this book? Is the way that marketing, and Oprah, got Millions of people ( myself, included. ) to dig Deep into our pockets to purchase it. Then, they made a movie. Julia Roberts, was the star! She looked, Amazing. Enough said."
1,forgettable meh,how did this book sell so many copies?it's completely meh.and she's wrecked bali...which is now positively swarming with women just like herself.it's a nightmare.
1,A Promising Beginning But....,"I couldn't force myself to finish it. I stopped reading at page 48. Yep, that early. I skimmed ahead to see if it would get better and it didn't so thats when I called it quits. I became very annoyed by her because she portrayed herself as this sad pathetic divorcee but then she would scatter little passages around about her good looks or her skinny figure or about how wealthy she is or some know it all attitude to make herself feel above her readers. It was just really pathetic to me. Yes, it is a memoir, but I really couldn't stand her."
4,Queen of similies,"Cleverly and entertainingly written. I didn't know what to expect under the 'strange' title. I was definitely pleasantly surprised, and recommend it to ladies from all ages."
4,Enjoyed this Book!,I enjoyed this book very much. The first (Italy) section is definitely the strongest though. I was disappointed in her early-on pontification about antidepressant meds (even though she herself took them).Other reviewers felt she was/is too self-absorbed. This did not annoy me as I believe she was well aware of this and was self-deprecating in her humor about it. It would have annoyed me if she had not even realized the degree of her self-absorption.
4,Great read... especially the first and third sections,"Laugh out loud funny, well, the first section mainly. Then it gravitates to deeper issues. This book is about a spiritual quest. But it's readable and welcoming! I'm usually not into reading spiritual books. I could never get even through the first page of most.But not this one. Ms. Gilbert writes from her heart and is willing to share every bit of herself, which I'm not exactly sure why she would, and I don't think she is quite sure either but she committed to writing the piece, no matter what. I respect and appreciate that on many levels."
1,tripe for the soul,"The Last American Man was a great book but this was a weak attempt loaded with rationalizations. Disappointed that she didn't draw a lot of hoots and hollers from Italian men, she goes on to explain that it isn't because she's not as attractive at 35 as she was at 23. No, it's that Italian men don't yell at the babes anymore. Oh and she meant to gain weight in Italy. blah"
1,Ugh!!!!,I am in complete awe of Ms. Gilbert for not only convincing someone to pay her to travel for a year but also taking something that resembles a poorly-written teenage diary and making a best-seller out of it. I guess believing in yourself really does work.
2,"Highly entertaining, but ....","..I think it is more like a long magazine article than like a book. The writer uses a lot of slangy expressions and popular culture references. In five years, I think it will seem very dated."
1,Amazingly Bad,"This is a sad, pathetic excuse for a book and a woman. The other critical reviews capture some of the best descriptions: boring, seemingly fabricated storyline; self-absorbed, narcissistic author unable to deal with normal life issues. Many in my book club couldn't stomach finishing it. We need to get this book off our book club lists."
2,The seller told me that it was in nicer condition than it was. I chose her more expensive book because of this reason.,"Was not happy with my purchase because I paid more for a nicer book, but the book was not nice. It smelled, was dirty and had bent pages."
1,Wasn't impressed,"This book could not grab me. I couldn't even finish it and it is rare that I do not finish a book. Usually I will keep on trucking through it, but this one I just could not. It was just not very interesting."
1,I complete disaster!!!!,What a frustrating read! It is absolutely amazing to me that this woman is making tons of money on this novel on her narcissism. I don't believe half of what she writes - I believe she wrote it all to have a paid vacation. Appauling!!!
2,Just off-putting,"Like many, after hearing so my hype about this book, I bought it. After reading only the first five pages, I was put off by the author's tone. She is glib, obnoxious and self-depreciating--and not in a humorous way. The tone only grew more arrogant as I read the rest of the novel, and I'm still not sure where I see her attaining spiritual growth...I see her eating too much, whining about her pants not fitting, and shacking up with some man at the end despite swearing off men.I had realized the book wouldn't be a travelogue, and being a memoir, would focus on the author; however, the author is very unlikeable and doesn't seem to see anything outside herself.I was just completely disappointed by the novel, and it pained me to finish it...I just kept hoping it would redeem itself; however, it only got worse."
2,Contrived,"Elizabeth Gilbert can write, no doubt about that. But this is a contrived tale, apparently ready for its screenplay treatment from the outset (Julia Roberts, anyone?)...it's honestly dishonest and an exceptional disappointment."
1,Dont waste your time,"Very self absorbed with nothing of depth or value. I got to page 105 and couldnt take it anymore! Poorly written, in that she threw in pieces of writing style that were clearly not hers and forced as they did not exist throughout the book such as her description of the meat hanging in the butcher shops in Italy, and the beginning where she starts with ""I wish Giovanni would kiss me..."". an attempt to periodically inject a writing style that is by itself interesting but not her own or consistent throughout the book. It seemed to me that her overreaction to her awful marriage was pathetic and unwarranted and the person who probably really suffered a horrible marriage was her husband and not the writer - pathetically weak and melodramatic. I resent having helped fund this as well."
1,"Self-absorbed, self-glorifying memoir","Depressing to think that someone who had the opportunity to be all the places EG went for the time that she did, could have failed to truly appreciate, understand and grow as a person..."
2,"Eat, Pray, Love",I was very disapointed in this book...very boring...my friends don't even want to read it.
1,327 Pages of Self-Indulgent Logorrhea,"I have come to detest Liz Gilbert and her sorry, indulgent life. Too much money, too much privilege, too little warmth and charm. There is no mind behind all this weak, silly babbling. If a word somehow fires off a neuron she repeats this word many unconnected times, stream of consciousness style, interspersed with chirpy factoids right out of the travel guide. I can't understand why any sensible person at GQ actually paid her for writing anything.It is truly frightening to have such a vapid mind revealed. What makes it worse is blithe disregard for grubby stuff like earning a living or helping another human being."
4,Good reccomendation,"This was decent book if you like to read memoires. It drags on in the middle, but picks up again in the third section."
1,egregious at every page,this has to be one of the most pretentious books i have every read. garbage through and through. if you have a fireplace...
1,What a Crock!!,"Didn't like it at all.I finished the book to see if there was anything redeming about it and to see what ALL THE FUSS IS over this book. The answer is no, nada, nothing, zilch, zipp. I wound up caring so little about the author when all is said and done. What a waste."
1,Painfully boring and narcissistic,"Being an avid reader and having four days on a retreat with no access to tv, phone or internet I thought I would have plenty of time to enjoy and finish this book. To my dismay, I could not make myself read this book and am still trying to read it for my book club but the author reminds me of a spoiled child that didn't like what she found in marriage so she chose to run and take the advance on her book to pay for her escape and we all must suffer through her narcissistic story. Her view of her self importance is revolting. I would not recommend this book. It is doubtful that I will finish it, this book is not an enjoyable read and if I do finish it will be soley for the purpose of being able to discuss it fully at the book club meeting."
3,There was a nice twist at the end.,"It was like the curates egg -- good in parts. I struggled with sections of the book. The time in India was heavy going and I considered giving up on it. However, I stuck with it and ended up quite enjoying the last part of the book."
2,Eat Pray Love,"Kinda like ""been there, done that"" so this type of fluff is rather boring. Sort of like a hippe-wannabe 'cept the author actually got paid a pretty penny for letting the reader witness her mindless meandering. The reader ends up being her shrink, and pity, has got to pay for the honor. Very self serving. Don't have enough emotion invested in this to ""hate it"" so the product ends up getting two stars instead of one. Really - yawn - not recommended. Waste if time and money."
5,"insightful, funny book","I loved this book from beginning to end, I laughed, cried and was with her on every step of her journey. There were so many aha moments for me. I have read the reviews in which people have been saying she is self-absorbed etc, I did not find this at all."
2,Annoying from the beginning,"I waited for this book from the library for a few weeks and finally got it! I started to read it with the excitement which wore off after a couple of pages, when I found myself thinking about something else while reading... The author is trying to be funny and philosophical, but is simply annoying and shallow, and self-absorbed! I gave this book 2 stars for the idea and because I learned about the meaning of beads in Eastern meditation. I may try to read it further, hoping to find some more educational facts about the places the author visited. But it is definitely not going to touch my soul! Too much crying on the floor over nothing! If you want a good memoir read: ""Three dog life"" - simple, deep, very engaging, and ""The glass castle""..."
2,Pages missing!,"""Eat, Pray, Love"" would be a great read if only 4 pages were not missing!! Was reading along and enjoying it until last night...I arrived at page 283-284 and found both were only half printed! I then checked further and found pages 291 and 292 were also only half printed. There is no way I can read these pages!I am greatly disappointed in this service!"
2,didn't make it past page 20.,"This is my first review and the embarrassing part is, I didn't even get past page 20. My sister accidentally left the book at my place after she visited, and as the mother of 3 with so little free time, I just couldn't bear to fill it with this kind of literature. I could just feel where it was going when, in the same paragraph, discussions about her ""gorgeous"" lover are intertwined with something this woman wanted to portray as spirituality, especially she talks about her own enlightened hindsight. I felt SO relieved when I read these reviews that confirmed my hunches."
1,A huge waste of time and money...,"I wish I could hit a fast forward button and see where this author is then....Ask yourself ""what do i really, really, want today"" ? What a piece of great advice.Oprah said on her show ""the happiest part of my day today, will be talking to you"" (the author).That is truly sad."
1,Find Yourself Midlife Crisis porn,"My objection to porn is not the sex, but that it makes sex look ugly. The same in my opinion can be said for ""Eat Pray Love"" and books like it: they make self-discovery, travel, spirituality, romance, etc. look ugly. Very, very ugly. But millions of women lap it up like a double latte sugar bomb and the authors and publishers laugh all the way to the bank.There are many outstanding woman writers out there - it's a shame that writers like Gilbert are the ones who get the spotlight.A film version is opening this summer - it was only a matter of time of course. Julia Roberts has gone from the trite hooker with a heart of gold drivel of ""Pretty Woman"" to this. Guess we haven't really come such a long way after all, baby."
2,what's the big deal?,"I can't undertand what all the hype is about this book. It is average and very superficial. Many people of Gilbert's generation have done what she has done, the travelling, the divorce, the ashrams, the search for self awareness - the only difference is she must have had some very good connections in the literary world to get this book published as I am very sure thousands could do better and make it more interesting. Gilbert comes across as very irritating and full of herself. Why are they making a movie of this tripe? Please!! Also she gives seminars now??? There must be a lot of very shallow people out there who would follow this kind of thing as 'inspirational'. It is CHICK LIT, nothing more and nothing less.Disappointing."
1,Hated it.,"A nauseating travelogue of a conceited self indulgent 30 something.Incredibly hard to finish, but I forced myself.The first part of the book she spends howling on her bathroom floor.I am soooo glad when she starts on the anti depressants but then she stops...big mistake.Italy, hmmm she drools over her 20 something language partner, eats and buys underwear to take to the Ashram.India she discovers she can't meditate. And talks. A lot.Bali she self obsesses more, I really was glad her ex did well in the divorce.I really felt for the poor guy.I think she would've done better had she stayed in a psychiatric facility and stayed on her meds."
2,Tripe anyone?,"I made the mistake of buying this book to take to the hospital where my 10 year old daughter was ""living"" for two months while they figured out how to eradicate an infection threatening her spinal fluid. So, to be fair, only something very profound could have matched the situation, but, this, decidedly, was a grossly shallow and unfortunate miscalculation on my part.The woman is a garden variety neurotic. Irritating. Period. And reading her journey is about as appealing as digging into a steaming bowl of entrails. They look good, but, in the end, we know what they are and that makes them hard to swallow.I wish a publisher would say, screw the money...Elizabeth dear, get thee to a shrink and quit boring us all. (By the way, I never made it to India with this woman...I ran screaming midway through Italy) I would have given it one star, but I found the tiny strings of Italian palatable."
1,Why is this book so highly rated?,"I don't know why this book was on the best sellers list for so long. I normally love to read and always finish my books but I just can't finish this one. I can't relate to her at all and wonder if anyone who has a somewhat normal life with responsibilities such as a husband, kids, career, housework, bills, aging parents, etc. relates? I got so tired of her trials with meditation, prayer, and travels...she doesn't know what REAL problems are."
1,Disapointing,"I couldn't agree more with all the ""one star"" reviewers. I was looking forward to reading of her impressions of living abroad but instead it was all about her and her depression for which she refused to take prescribed medication. Don't waste your time, so glad I didn't puchase this, it was a library book, waste of tax dollars!"
1,Woe is ME!,"I can not understand what the hype is for this book. I just could not get over how pathetic the author is, and how overly self absorbed she is. I found it so difficult to relate to this person who suddenly decides one day she doesn't want to be married anymore (for no apparent reason than her own selfishness). This was so disturbing to me...she had said a vow at some time, right? I had trouble getting past the Italy section. I could not put up with another minute of the author's descriptions of what a ""victim"" she is that I decided to drop the book all together when 6 people in my book club were not in love with the book or the author much more than me."
3,Road to the Self,"An open, honest acount of a spiritual, emotional and physical journey to happiness, contentment and fulfillment. It helped me gain some insights for myself. I feel it would be helpful for women (and possibly some men) going through relationship breakups, and who are searching for more meaning in their lives. Contains some very rich imagery."
1,very disappointing,"i had heard so much about this book and got on a waiting list at the library to get it. i was to have the book back in seven days as it was a ""waiting list"" item. i became so disinterested with the book, that it took me over two weeks to finish it and get it back to the library. i had to make myself finish it. i thought it would be an inspirational book about healing after a divorce and finding your purpose in life, but it's no more than the author's preoccupation with sex. thus, the book is just some sexual odessey through italy, indonesia and bali. it's crude at times, and for me was a disappointment. the author goes into such detail on some pages, i had to take a break and put the book down. it became so boring. i, in all honesty, would not recommend it to any of my friends or family. i wonder at times how the hype can get so huge on a book like this. how does it start?"
2,A Waste of a Good Title,"The author may be an intelligent writer, but this piece is very depressing and seems to have too much focus on the authors life and it comes across as quite selfish. A me, me, me story. I am only into the second CD and want to take it back to the library. I am glad to have not wasted any money on this one."
3,Eh...not that great - don't get the hype,"The first part of this book EAT set in Italy was great; loved it; so funny and fast reading. The second part PRAY set in India - eh, okay but ""keep reading - I don't ever not finish a book"" but by the third part LOVE set in Bali I just couldn't do it anymore and I basically skimmed through the last of it. Fortunately my friend had highlighted all the good and meaningful lines. Disappointing because I really thought it was going to be great. Try it if you must but be prepared for a let down; haven't seen the movie but probably will one day. Love that husband of Penelope Cruz...."
3,NOT THAT GREAT,"WELL... IT TOOK ME SIX MONTHS TO FINISH READING THIS BOOK!!! WHAT CAN I SAY??? THERE WERE SOME PARTS I REALLY LIKED, OTHERS I REALLY HATE ( LIKE THE PART SHE LOOKS AT GOD; PLEASE...!!!!!) ON THE OTHER HAND, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE MOVIE, JUST TO SEE ITALY, INDIA AND BALI. CAN'T WAIT."
5,Shockingly good!,"It's no fluke that Gilbert's travel book has soared to the top of best-sellers lists in paperback. She's a great writer, an extremely interesting lady, and as most fine authors ... brutally honest. But above all she is naturally hilarious, and she makes you want to know her and travel along with her. You wouldn't think anyone could succeed with such an ambitious title, let alone based on real-life experiences, but she pulls it off. I passed on my copy to my sister, and now I'm sorry I did. Buy it if you are recently divorced, buy it if you are happily married, buy it if you're female, buy it if you're male ... but above all buy it!"
4,"Finding love, food, and spirituality in the wrong places","Chronicles the journey of a recently divorced US womanas she rediscovers herself on a journey to the three countriesin the title. In Italy, she almost finds love and food; inIndia she searches for spiritual guidance, but ends up finding thatand much more (in the form of a new love) on Indonesia. This bookwas enjoyable at times and rather boring at others. Thecharacters introduced in Italy were fun, especially the gentlemannamed Luca Sphagetti!"
1,"Regurgitate, Curse, Loathe","I had also heard all the hype for this book and bought it without reading the Amazon reviews (a mistake I don't plan to repeat. I don't often quit books, but I was very tempted. I scanned my way through most of it. I find it interesting that someone can ramble on and on without ever making a point, yet somehow get a bestseller out of it."
1,"Boring, hard to finish reading, hated every second of each page..","Horribly written book, I made it to page 292 and couldn't FORCE myself to read any longer, I had too many other good books waiting. I was disappointed, everyone said this book was amazing, interesting, and clever - I couldn't get past the author's selfishness and obsession with food and her EX husband. Horrible horrible horrible !"
1,Don't Bother,"If I could give this book negative stars I would. I can read just about anything and like many of the other dissatisfied readers TRIED my darndest to enjoy this book. I too was unable to read past mid India. The breaking point for me was when she heard a story from her ""dear friend"" the Nat Geo photographer who had met men and women who had climbed Everest among other mind boggling and over achieving feats - and OF COURSE her response was to make it about HERSELF and how her spiritual enlightenment was far more impressive and superior. I threw the book down in disgust and never looked back. In no way do I admire this woman. As another reviewer said she is the type of woman you see at a cocktail party and run the other way. I don't at all pity or sympathize with her. It is truly sad that we, the reader are expected to."
1,"Self-discovery? Nah, just self-absorbed","You have to really like someone to put up with their extended, detailed descriptions of self-discovery. Otherwise, they come across as hugely self-absorbed and self-centered. Despite Ms. Gilbert's proclamations throughout the book that she is extremely likeable, that she has many, many friends who find her likeable, and that even God finds her likeable...she comes across firmly in the `hugely self-absorbed' category to me. Some of her descriptions of people and places are funny and worthwhile, but mostly she's like listening to an annoying pseudo-friend who asks you `how you are' because they really only want to tell YOU how THEY are."
3,good beach read,"I read this book on vacation - read like a tasty desert. I liked it as a travel journal more than for the authors personal revelations about life and relationships. The author seemed a bit spoiled and over indulged. I loved her descriptions of her travels, what she ate and her yoga revelations. Been to Italy and India, not Bali but now I want to go. Probably closer to 3.5 stars."
2,Undeserving Drama Queen,"Can't like this. No matter the raves of friends and Oprah, I found the protagonist's gripes petty, reactions unconvincing and explanations too long. Don't get me wrong, I like some good break-up drama. I just couldn't sympathize with this one."
3,Self Absorbed?,"I read this book with our book club and enjoyed it because of the humor and travel. However, it left me a bit unsettled because our media constantly bombards us with stories of people who seem to have everything and yet are unsatisfied because of the emptiness inside. While this well-written book was entertaining, I prefer books and movies that evoke emotion. I recently read another memoir called: My Mother Killed Christ: But God Loves Me Anyway. As the title reveals, it was a bit weightier than this book, but left me feeling joyful and satisfied in the end. Both are tales of exceptional women."
4,"Read, Read, Read!","I wasn't enthused when my book club chose this. The travel memoir as tale of self-discovery has been done. But reading Elizabeth Gilbert is like catching up with your funniest, most sensitive friend. Unlike other reviewers, I really didn't need her to offer up any post-divorce wisdom, observations on Indian poverty, or anthropological insights on the Balinese. I can get that elsewhere. This book entertains. Yes, she can come off as self-indulgent (claiming to pass on meeting the Dali Lama -- as if). But I couldn't help liking her and I thoroughly enjoyed her company. This is a good, fun, summer read. Maybe the title misleads; wisdom seekers can skip it."
4,"Elegant writing, spiritual insight","I am a writer and I found myself blown away by her clean, elegant style ( maybe even a little jealous). Not only is she a masterful craftsman, she has had some extraordinary experiences (and some ordinary ones,too) that provide insight for anyone on a spiritual journey of their own.This book has it all: adventure, sex, food."
2,"The more I read, the more I disliked the author",The book is well written and entertaining up until Italy (chapter 36) then it gets boring and preachy. The thing that made the book almost unbearable in the end is how much I grew to dislike the author as the book went on. She just seems self centered and self indulgent throughout the entire book that made me ask this question in the end - why does she deserve a happy ending? A simple advise for anyone thinking of reading this book - you can spend your time more wisely than read about someone who is so unhappy with herself and full of herself at the sametime (sounds contradictory but this my thought).
2,"I expected better, a lot better!","I really expected to like and sympathize with the author and her story but the opposite happened. Right from the beginning it is clear that this woman is a selfish, weak-minded brat. I would LOVE for her ex-husband to come out with his own book about what happened in their marriage since Ms. Gilbert does not share any details; probably because it would make her look really bad. I struggled through the middle when she was in India- boring! It had a few nice moments, hence two stars, but I don't understand why people rave about this book and think she is so inspiring. The annoyance that is Julia Roberts is the perfect actor to portray this woman and her little tale."
3,"A fine ""escape"", but ridiculous","I read all types of books. I enjoy the author's personality throughout this book. I enjoy ""light"" books right before bed, and this fits the bill. A light-hearted story to stop your own busy mind and focus on someone elses life.When I really think about this book, it makes me gag. This woman went through what type of hardship? A divorce? Then breakup from a different guy? That's it???? And she had to take a whole year off from life to become ok with this? And not only that, but it seems like she's been suffering for several years because of all this.Is she for real? Does she understand that people suffer through much worse than what she's been through? And they certainly do not have the luxury to run off to Rome then India then Bali for a whole entire year!!!Again, a pleasant read right before bed. Helped me sleep like a baby. But.......... Elizabeth Gilbert........... Get Real........."
5,"ENLIGHTING, EXCELLENT, FANTASTIC, LOVED IT","THIS BOOK IS GREAT..... I LOVE THE WAY ELIZABETH GILBERT WRITES, I CAN TRULY RELATE TO THIS BOOK..... I THINK ALL WOMAN WOULD BE ABLE TO RELATE. FANTASTIC.. WHAT A GREAT WRITER... I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL MY FEMALE FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I REALLY ENJOYED AND WAS MOVED BY THIS BOOK. THANK YOU ELIZABETH"
2,UNrealistic,"While parts of this book make for a good read, it is hard to believe that such a spastic person has everything work out for just in time to write a book. If you must read this, skip the"
2,Not worth it,My book club chose this for our summer reading book since the movie was due out in August. Most of the book group didn't even bother finishing it to the end. I somehow managed and was not impressed.
2,Not sure what the fuss is all about,"Haven't read any reviews by anyone about this book, but noted that it was a ""hot read"" at the library, so gave it a go. Its not what I expected. The early section in New York I enjoyed about Elizabeths marriage and new love affair; and Elizabeth's travels in Italy also were fun reading (being a food lover, I could relate to the enjoyment of good food in Italy) and then.........We get to India, and I had to skim read the pages and pages and pages about meditation etc. God, that was boring. Could not wait for that part of the book to be over. Onto Indonesia, and slightly more interesting, but still a lot of chatter about meditation and life.There are obviously people who love the book, and that is great to find a book that enthralls and motivates you so much, but alas, I was not one of them."
3,Hits the publishing zeitgeist,"This book hits the zeitgeist swamping publishing these days - books about ghosts, otherness, spirituality. The writing is excellent and keeps you glued to the page but the content is dire - me, me, me. This is not an intelligent book. Three countries and not the least interest in the economics, politics or infrastructure of any of them. Just soul-searching which could have taken place with a guru group in New York State. In the first part, Eat, I thought when will you get to the point; skip, skip, skip to the second part, slightly more absorbing, and then limp on to the last part to find there is no point - well she gets her man. No wonder the film is a flop."
2,big disappointment,"I should have learned my lesson after the Oprah,"" Million Little Pieces"" fiasco but decided to read this book. Maybe I am too old to appreciate her work. I found it slow and boring. Yes, parts were interesting and educational but I truly had to skip large chunks of the writing. Otherwise i'd probably just fall asleep. My sister calls it, Eat, Pray,Snore. I think she has a point!I was really dismayed and perhaps this time can really discount what Oprah praises.I did read that the author married her lover which was a nice note.Hope they are happy.I don't think i'll be rushing to read her account of that situation!"
5,What a great story!,"This author has an impressive writing voice and a good sense of humor about herself and life. What a voyage, and how beautiful that it turned out so well for her. The book lags a bit in the middle, but picks right up again at the end. I wille be reading more of her books."
1,Boring,"Just another self indulgent autobiography. It was too boring to read and had not much to say. If you are in for light reading, go for it. Do not expect too much from this one or you might be very disappointed."
4,Sometimes a Cheap Laugh,"I was almost turned off from reading this book after the first few pages because of a trait Elizabeth Gilbert freely admits: '...perhaps I don't always have to go for the cheap laugh.' Luckily, I read a few more pages and then couldn't put it down. This is an amazingly honest account of an inner and outer journey, often inspiring, sometimes hilariously funny, and also at times a tearjerker - in the best possible way - as Gilbert describes the real lives of real people, and her own relentless quest to 'rest in God's palm.'"
2,superficial,The title just about says it. Not much going on here other than search for everything without meaning. It's a superficial search for men everywhere--not a very worthwhile or provocative read. I finished it only because I don't like leaving before giving the book a full chance. I did and didn't find anything worth the time.
5,"GREAT , WITTY , WELL WRITTEN, CAPTIVATING","I read this book in a couple of days because I couldn't put it down. She is such a great writer, and I really felt like I went on that trip with her. She speaks what's going on in her mind and her transformation. It is real. Her journey is also symbolic for many in their lives who go on a spiritual quest, whether it be across the world or in day to day life of work and relationships. Learning, growing and finding a balance. I loved it and hope the movie gives it justice."
3,"People, the book is just what it says it is.","I have children the age Elizabeth Gilbert was when she wrote the book. Perhaps this provides my perspective. A well-written, rather self indulgent (and the author says as well) tome. Nothing more or less.Anyone else think that Julie Roberts is a decade too old to play this role? What a horrid choice."
2,Mildly entertaining but not inspirational,"Yes, this is a memoir. Yes, she's a good writer. But the book is irritating because I find very little in it to inspire the reader. I, like several others, see in the writing a self-consciousness in the trip that ties back to the book advance. Many times I wanted to just shake her and tell her to grow up and take responsibility for her life and seek some satisfaction and meaning by moving beyond herself. But perhaps, I already have the quiet mind that she mentions, and don't need to spend a year pursuing it."
4,fun to read,"a light reading book that can easily fill in your evenings. The author has a keen sense of humor even when writing about the dark, difficult times of her life. I found it easy to read, a fun book to give to friends (especially if they travel), there are some deep insight about life and the unexpected turns, but in general its a light reading book."
3,Gilbert Too Self-Important,"This is not a BAD book. Gilbert is ambitious and brave -- not only to take such a journey, but to write about it so candidly. With that said, I was mainly turned off by her tone of self-importance and had to largely skip over the section on India because... to be frank, I just didn't care. With her disclaimers on why she won't tell us the cause of her divorce to why she won't disclose the name of the ashram or guru, I wanted to tell her -- no one even asked. Too defensive and too presumptuous for my taste. Maybe Gilbert fans want to know every aspect of her life, but, as this is my first Gilbert book, she comes off as being too self-important."
1,book review,I thought the book was boring and hard to really get into. If you want to read it try it out at the public library first before you buy.
3,Two journeys,"Following the journey of Elizabeth Gilbert as she dealt with her reconciliation in dealing with the termination of her marriage took us on two simultaneous trips. One involved spiritual study and enlightenment and the other was a year long adventure in Italy, India, and Indonesia.Some might see an ongoing conflict between self-indulgence and spiritual sacrifice, while others might sense the harmony uniting the two trips. This book resulted in the bringing together of the two pilgrimages.After all is said and done, this is a good read. It is a book of emotions. It is both funny and heart wrenching."
2,Clearly dissappointing,I looked forward to reading this book and couldn't wait to get into the story. Very flat & uninspiring to say the least. It really didn't move me and the author missed the mark on this one.Smitty's Cave Adventures
4,Pretty Good Read...,"So I guess the real question is, would I recommend Eat Pray Love? The answer is yes. Despite my main complaint, I did find the book to be quite fascinating. The book is well written and the author is fairly likable. As long as you can get past the fact that her journey towards self discovery was done in an ""extravagant"" fashion, then I think you'll enjoy it as much, if not more, than I did.To read my full review of this book please go to Literary Escapism!"
2,Didn't really like it,I noticed a lot of people had really positive or really negative reactions to the book. I chose to listen to it on audio book because I love to travel and liked the concept of the author taking off the discover herself. I can't say that I really hated it. I was just hoping for more. It was kind of boring. The author would be describing an interesting conversation and suddenly state that she was not going to say anymore about this. This happened several times and I wanted to hear more about it. I'm really surprised that it's being made into a movie. I can't see it being entertaining.
1,Expected more. MUCH more.,"This book reminded me of a quote that's served me well in life: ""It's a sign of maturity when you begin to fall out of love with your own drama."" The author clearly hasn't reached this stage on her path to ""enlightenment""!"
5,Eat Pray Love,"Excellent service! With used items sometimes the description it not so hot, but this was spot on. It arrived promptly and was shipped to ensure that it arrived in the same condition in which it was shipped. I would absolutely use this seller again."
4,Good Read,I found the story to be a little cliche but it's an easy read and gives you a different inner perspective. Also makes you wanna travel :) Fun to read but don't expect too much.
4,Pleasant Easy Read,"Though not the deepest of all the existential novels, there is something very sweet and familiar in Gilbert's Eat Pray Love. Her writing is very straight forward and accessible. The joy in this book is the common theme of self-discovery that is universal. A bildungsroman for 30-somethings."
4,Surprised,I really did not expect to enjoy this book as much as I did. Someone gave me the audio book and after listening to it I bought the book for reference. I admire the author for being so frank and honest about her life.
1,A journal of selfishness and self-indulgence...,"I put this book down in disgust tonight, vowing to go no further when I reached the end of the Italy part. This is a very personal memoir, and while the writing is good at times, the author is someone I would personally not like to know. Selfish and self-indulgent, the author will never grow up no matter how far she travels."
3,Self Absorbtion,"Although there are good moments and there are some nice humorous touches, overall it is too much about one person's self discovery/recovery journey.The premise had promise but didn't pan out completely."
1,One of the worst books I ever read,I hated the author from the beginning and she got even more irritating as the book went on. Her views on marriage and kids were selfish and nerve grating. Dont waste your $$ on this book. Buy something else instead.I gave it 1 star but I really wanted to give it -stars.
3,Entertaining but not life changing,"This book did not change my life or inspire me to find my own godly connection. It def made me want to go to Rome and Bali, though. The book is an entertaining read, especially with the neurotic author that you will want to commit to therapy more than once. It slows down a bit in India but if you power through and get to Bali I found the end to be rewarding and inspiring. I would give it 3.50 stars if I could."
1,Terrible.....,"What a total snorefest about a self-absorbed narcissist. She leaves a marriage because she feels 'unfulfilled' and gets applause, yet what would happen if a man did the exact same thing? He'd be lambasted from every side imaginable.In essence, the author had a mid-life crisis, abandoned her husband for a younger man and so she could 'self-indulge'. Really---what's the difference between that and a 45 year old man who had the same mid-life crisis, leaves his wife for a younger woman, buys a '68 Ford Mustang all zooped up and starts working out at the gym?There is no difference, except it's become politically correct to give a two thumbs up to a woman who has a mid life crisis and goes off, while giving a man two thumbs down for the exact same thing."
2,Unimpressed,"I was given this book by a friend, I normally would not have bought this type of book. I think much of the story is fictitious and why do the people she meets always have some fantastic background, i.e., the Brazilian lady who worked for the UN, Richard from Texas, (an unbelievable character if ever there was one)? Luca Spaghetti? Oh, be real. I just can't believe she met so many exceptional characters. Her statement that ""we all need God"" just turned me off as I don't believe in God but I don't mind if anyone else does. How presumptuous to believe that she knows what I need. I became disinterested during the India section and my interest continued to wane until I couldn't finish the book. This book is a waste of time."
1,"Book didn't arrive, watched the movie",I was intending on reading this book on a drive during the Thanksgiving holiday but it never arrived so I wound up watching the movie. I've been told that the book is better (aren't they always) but the movie put me off so I won't try to read the book. I just couldn't find a connection with the main character. Perhaps the book draws the reader more into the characters desperation at not knowing where she fits in in the world but in the movie she came off as just lost and kind of whiney.
2,Un-Filling Food,"Eat in Italy, pray in India, love in Bali (Indonesia). It's a charming traveling journal, but a spiritual journey it is not. Italy is the tastiest and most personal. The rest is light, prose included, and appears to be over the author's head. She seems more like a little girl experimenting the taste of various cakes than a fully grown woman trying to find meaning in her life. To do the latter, a travel of the mind needs no plane or new country, but maybe eyes, a heart, and involvement in causes beneficial to forces outside one's own belly-button."
2,Skip the Book,This book was a huge disappointment. I could not finish it. Skip the book and watch her [...] instead. She's a MUCH better speaker. I could never recommend this book as it doesn't deliver. Self-absorbed ramblings that only end up irritating the reader as you could be reading something else!
2,Why was this on the NYT best seller list?,"I had a hard time getting through this book. The author is pretentious, whiney and very self-absorbed. She whines about her divorce, but it seems like she was the one who just up and left and took up with another man. Her year of travel seems less of discovering herself and all about a Year of Me. She goes to at least two places - India and Bali - with much poverty and never seems to note it or want to be involved. It would be nice if we could all just travel for a year after a divorce to find our way."
3,slightly disappointed,"The description of this item said that there were NO MARKINGS on the front cover or any pages. Unfortunately, when I received the item, there were underlinings and highlights on MANY of the pages of the book. I emailed the seller of this item with my concern and never heard back. Aside from the inaccurate description, the overall condition of the book was very good and shipping was very prompt."
2,PDXbookstore,"I ordered from PDXbookstore and it took forever to get my item. The book I originally ordered was supposed to have been in good condition, but when I received it, the cover was covered in chocolate or some sort of food, the book was bent and was far from good condition. I was very disappointed with the service I received from them."
1,Really bad book,"Self-congratulatory, shallow and proselytizing. Because it was on my book club's reading list, I tried and tried to read it. At page 59, I threw it into the trash."
2,b,Received in a timely manner and in good condition. I guess I'm one of very few who did not really enjoy this book. I thought it to be a slow and rather boring read.
3,Were it not for the humor...,"I might have ditched this read altogether. But our adventuress here--though extraordinarily self-absorbed, narcissistic ad infinitim--Ms. Gilbert DOES have sense of humor. And thank goodness for that! I did laugh many a time throughout her journey, yet couldn't help cringing at her enormous pre-occupation with herself and really, what are tiny, if not unimportant, dramas! While I am not going to agree that this is a waste of time, (like many of the one-star reviewers here) there is much better out there."
1,Recommended for All Wealthy 30something White Women EVERYWHERE,"Jack Kerouac went bumming around America with his friends with no money in his pockets, working odd jobs and traveling back roads and highways, looking for...well, he didn't quite know what he was looking for, and he wasn't sure he ever found it, but it's the journey that matters, not the destination.SILLY JACK KEROUAC.He should have secured a $200,000 book advance from his publisher, jetted to Italy, India, and then Bali and after getting his book on the New York Times Bestseller list, he could've sold the movie rights for millions more.And then advised everybody to do the same to find ""happiness"".Well, that is, everybody who is an attractive white thirtysomething American with $200,000 in pocket money.Oh, and the writing style reminds me of a teenage girl's diary, about as deep as a wading pool after a fat kid has cannonballed in it."
5,A wonderful story about a women's journey spiritually,This story is a real account of the struggles of a women to figure out who she is against the prescribed identities forstered by society.It is a wonderful uplifting book and parallels all of our journies conscious or unconscious through out our time here. I highly recommend it.
4,Another Woman's Search,"Good writing style, with a touch of humor and a good hard look at her emotions. Entertaining and helpful in my growth & search."
2,Self-absorbed author leaves husband looking for spiritual fulfilmment through carnal excesses.,"The book is beautifully written, but I found the author/protagonist shallow, self-absorbed and pretentious..I was turned off at the opening when she walked out on her husband for unspecified reasons (i.e. ""not fulfilling my emotional needs"") and then had the balls to be surprised when he was hurt and lashed back..Another reviewer, ""Wanjugo,"" nailed it when she wrote: ""Many people say it was courageous for her to leave him, but the word selfish kept coming to my mind. Also thought about the DOUBLE STANDARDS in the American culture because a man who leaves his wife because he is sad in the marriage I bet would not sell so many books."".This is appeals to the modern woman who, in a 21st version of Cinderella, expects her husband to satisfy all of her emotional and spiritual needs while supplying her with regular orgasms..This book did not push my buttons at all."
1,Waste of time!,"It's such a shame that she decided to abandon her faith and go on a worldwide quest to find what she already had! crying about not wanting to be married anymore is like a spoiled child who doesn't get their way, but isn't that how a lot of women are starting to see motherhood and marriage? as a bore and a waste of time? marriage is honorable as having children is honorable. Promiscuity and ""finding yourself"" seem to be the hot ticket these days! but it comes with a price - heartache and STDs. Want to find yourself? just look in the mirror! travel the world by all means, but you won't FIND YOURSELF! I couldn't finish this book it was so irritating. I have traveled all over and been to India where I saw beautiful people with beautiful smiles but so many of them lived in wretched poverty."
2,2 Stars for Italy,"I breezed through this book hoping to find the intelligent and inspiring story everyone seems to rave about. I was sadly disappointed: the author is self-absorbed, impulsive, and whines about everything in her life. Her constant ""God"" talk became extremely annoying. I did enjoy the Italy section with the descriptions of the food and language, although I think Gilbert missed out on the art and culture aspect of Italy. Oh well...."
1,Self-absorption Personified,"Here's my synopsis of ""Eat, Pray, Love"":""OOOO look at me. I'm travelling. Aren't I clever? Nobody else has ever travelled before so I will tell you how special I am because I travel. And I split up with my boyfriend of two months. Boo hoo. Quelle tragedie!!!! This sent me into a ""depression"". Poor me. I am having a nervous breakdown because of this terrible tragedy, but after a year of travel I will be a Guru. Aren't I special and clever?"""
2,Ok,Another westerner who sees poverty in places such as Bali and somehow translates that into spiritual enlightenment.
2,"Eat , Pray , & Love Should be retitled Eat, Help & Love","Let me first say alot of people just love this book. My only question to the writer is why couldn't she have just stayed in the USA and had the same journey? She could have eaten in some 5 star resturants. Next, she could have went to a women's shelter, soup kitchen, cancer hospital, or Hospice, and yes the v word volunteer. I think then she would have really found God. The third part of her journey was love. Oh wait you don't find riches there just diamonds in the rough. With all the money from the advance on the book she could have did alot more for her self and people in need . I now understand why Julia Roberts is playing the lead roll in the movie. For the first time I hope the movie is better than the book."
2,Selfishly indulgent,"As others have said before me, a well-written book (mostly) by an intensely self-centered woman. I feel so sorry for the rest of the world that this is the type of American women that they all must think we are. Selfishly indulgent, Gilbert made me totally sympathetic to her husband whom she divorced. Why? Even though she had a wonderful job, lived in a wonderful home, her husband was ready to start a family. For this she found herself having a breakdown on the floor of her bathroom in the middle of the night? Marriage counseling not an option?The book is worth reading for the world tour. But don't buy it. Get it from your library."
4,traveling the world,"this book was a decent book in my opinion; however, it took me a good few chapters to get into the book. Taking the extra ime to read it is worth it because you may not always like something when you first read it but then you enoy it and you are then glad you read it"
5,Eat Pray love,This book was for a book club and I had a blast reading how is does all the stuff it made me laugh so hard at times I almost cried it is such a good book I can't wait until her another book comes out I still waiting I got this on the day of book club it was good thanks
1,Really???,"I am so glad to see that I am not the only woman in the world who found this to be a dull, contrived and tedious read. I attmepted not once, not twice, but three times to convince myself that this was, in fact, a good read. Gilbert's attmepts at humor are forced and annoying, her narrative voice somehow nasal and irritating. I made it about 2/3 of the way through and couldn't take another word. Life-changing for some...torturous for others. Count me in the latter."
1,Lame...,"I don't know what else to say, but this lady needs to grow up. This is typical of the women in big cities like NYC, LA, or the Bay Area: shallow, self absorbed, idiotic. I'd like to slap this women in the head and tell her to snap out of it. Welcome to reality!"
2,Meh,"Elizabeth Gilbert is only about a tenth as funny as she thinks she is. Her story is only about a tenth as interesting as it could have been.Her writing reminded me of those people who speak really loudly and simply to non-English speakers. This book almost literally hurt my ears and made me vaguely embarrassed for its author, who is making quite a spectacle for no good reason."
1,Awful and selfish.,"Unless you want to waste your time reading about a smug, self-centered woman who is so selfish that she walks out on her marriage to pursue her own petty desires, don't bother reading this tripe."
2,A disappointment,"After all the hype for this book, I thought it would be wonderful. Wrong. I didn't care for the book at all. The author is too spoiled and self absorbed and the book is quite boring. I put it down so many times, it took me several weeks to finish it."
5,Completely captivating,"As if Liz Gilbert walked into my apartment and stayed for a week, captivating me with her trove of immensely entertaining and brilliant stories from her year of soulful travels. I found the India chapter especially amazing for its descriptions of meditation and the depths plumbed and Bali a fairytale in all the best senses of the form."
4,"Funny, insightful, well-written","What could have been a dry ""discovery of self"" treatise or an oh-so-cute ""Under the Italian/Indian/Indonesian Sun"" pseudo-memoir becomes, in Gilbert's talented hands, an honest, self-deprecating, funny book. What struck me most was how different elements of Gilbert's personality came to the forefront in each locale... yet her own core shown through. A great testimony for the saying, ""Wherever you go, there you are."""
1,MADE myself finish this book,One of the few books I MADE myself finish. This lady could justify anything just by talking in circles.Heaven help thiose whose life she touches
2,woe-is-me,"Thrilled for this woman that her book was a hit, but god HELP us if she had to juggle kids and a career. I'm wondering if the fact that it's a 'live vicariousy' read for women is why it was a hit, because most women couldn't possibly have these problems. I'm also wondering - as she barely addresses it - if perhaps her self-indulgence is what sent her husband packing. People process pain differently but she's way to absorbed over her loss and I worry she might not have much to offer to children if she can't think outsider her personal box. Read like a travel diary (eating ice cream in Italy, yawn) but got more interesting as she entered the Ashram with a look into something we woudln't ordinarily know. Glad she found happiness with the new man."
1,ehhhh could be used as a beverage coaster,I bought this book in November of last year stopped after the first 3 chapters tried to pick it up again this summer and had to stop at page 90 something...this book is just like its author they're both pretty much useless it actually deserves a rating of NEGATIVE 5 stars..lesson learnt don't always fall for the hype and do your research .. I wouldn't recommend anyone to waste their money buying this nonesense..on the brighter side its been on my side-table and makes an excellent coaster
1,Couldn't get past the first few pages.,"I was very turned off that the woman walked out on her marriage. Maybe if she had tried to ""find herself"" spiritually before she considered leaving her husband, I would have been more sympathetic. Basically, it looked like she traveled around the world, ate a lot of food, vegetated in India and then shacked up with a Himbo guy. Notice that relationship doesn't last, either. She doesn't seem to have learned much about commitment! Maybe she's taking her cues from Hollywood.Really don't see the appeal of this book and have no interest in watching the movie."
3,A nice read. Not particularly taxing.,"I enjoyed this book--I have to be honest, its strangely enjoyable to read about someone who has reached lower depths than oneself and came back unscathed. Made me feel more normal. :) She has a lovely writing style and the structure of the book makes it a great read for commuting...lots of short vignettes...or to pick up and put down at leisure."
4,Methink I Read a Little Whining,"Reading a lot of these reviews I detect more than a little JEALOUSLY AND ENVY. I admit when I first started reading this book I felt a bit of it as well. However, once I got the section on prayer, the book was very moving and actually made me think a lot about God/the infinite/the universe.So stop whining. No one made you read the book. Are you so self-centered and judgemental that you can't appreciate another's personality and quirky charm? Yes she is self-centered. And yes, many of us are SPAZZES. What's wrong with people these days???? So much anger. Perhaps halting your holier-than-thou attitude might help some. Sure most of us can't all afford to travel for a year and look for our authentic selves. But don't be so peevish about it."
5,Life Changing Book,"This book has helped shape my life. Elizabeth constantly reminds me of myself, all the anxious, social, romantic, emotionalness that is her personality. I have been inspired by this book to take up meditation and to explore myself and my relationship with God more deeply.Some people hate this book, which baffles me, but I feel sorry for them that they are unable to understand the spiritual beauty of it. Their hearts and minds are closed, and they do not want to be changes.Read this book if you are open and want to become closer to yourself and to God. This story is not about travel and adventure, but about becoming a better person and growing close to God and our true selves."
1,How is this a best seller?,"This book made me want to stick a fork in my eye. Whiny, self-obsessed and wah wah wah! ""I got paid to travel for a year"" ""Doing yoga in India is HARD"".Spare me."
1,should probably be FICTION,"From the first page of the book, things just didn't sound right. It all seemed made up, from the way things happened to the people she met on her ""spiritual"" journey. ESPECIALLY the part in Bali, it seemed totally made up! It was all ME ME ME. I don't know why anyone would want to read a self-absorbed story that is supposedly true...For those who have read it and hated it, there's a new book called Drink, Play, F@#k by Andrew Gottlieb who writes Bob Sullivan's (elizabeth Gilbert's EX) 1 year journey to Ireland, Las Vegas, and Thailand. It's not a true story but SOO hilarious!"
3,"Mediocre, but gets better if you manage to keep going....","There was so much hype surrounding this book that I rushed out to buy it only to discover it was pretty disappointing. The first half of the book (Italy up through the middle half in India) was a chore to read. I wanted to enjoy this book and really share in her experiences and her journey, but honestly I found it so difficult to feel much empathy for her. The book does improve by the time she hits Bali, and this is only because other characters are introduced and so you finally get a chance to hear other people's thoughts, a welcome break from her blatherings found in the first half of the book."
1,Couldn't finish it.,"Well, like some of the other reviewers, I found myself annoyed by Ms. Gilbert's tone from the beginning. I plodded onward, however, certain it would change, until I reached page 61. I quote ""Americans spend billions to keep themselves amused with everything from porn to theme parks to wars ...."" What's up with that, Elizabeth?? Americans are amused by WARS? Nuff said."
4,"Very readable, entertaining, light-hearted spirtual memoir...","I loved this book because I totally relate to this woman. I'm also an aspiring writer who desperately tries to control her negative thinking-and is searching for God. The narrator is funny--although some reviewers are ""disgusted"" by her--Gilbert is a real woman-with real emotions. I think we should all look at our own lives before we judge others...The book is an easy read-and deals with the big issues-what is our purpose? It's a light-hearted alternative to deeper more philosophical, more BORING books. It is about living in the NOW-appreciating the NOW.And honestly, I used to be an avid reader--but I've only managed to finish 3 books this year incl/ this one--the others were The Red Tent, and Harry Potter 7. So kudos to Ms. Gilbert!"
4,Absolutely Worth It,"I really enjoyed this book and while envied the authors' ability to travel at length, agree that the search for self-love and acceptance is, in actuality, the opposite of selfish. I am thrilled that this author found limitless compassion and understanding for herself through her spiritual practice as she then was able to extend that same compassion and understanding to those around her. In her courageous honesty about her own feelings of superiority, judgment, lonliness, anger and despair she allows her reader to relate without shame. And if we let ourselves, we can all relate. We are all human beings."
4,"Eat, Pray, Love","Well this book had me reading it morning noon, and night. I enjoyed the whole story and could relate to where Elizabeth was coming from. I had my own journey seeking 'who am I' about 15 yrs ago, and I went to an Ashram over a 15 yr period about seven times. I now feel so peaceful with the spiritual life I lead. Meditation is so important.I have been to Italy, India and Ubud, Bali, and love all three. I am a great non fiction reader. The book was fantastic to read and loved Elizabeth's honesty."
3,Go girl!,"What a journey this lady took herself on! Doing all the things that she had wanted to do. She did them to her fill and then moved on. It is the only way any of us can discover and explore ourselves and come to let go of our yearnings. Call it self absorbed. I saw her journey as a journey of living life, her life to its fullest. It takes courage to immerse yourself in your dreams and live them. We should all do that! She started he life living a probable existence and ended up living her possibilities - her destiny. Does it get better than that?Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
2,POOPY,"I really tried to get through this boring, self-absorbed thing, but somewhere at mid-point I just said to myself 'enough already!'There are too many good books out there to waste my time! Don't waste yours.Its crap."
1,very disappointing,"Oh my gosh...I am half way through this book and I cannot believe how awful it is. I don't even think I can finish this shallow, liberal, and annoying journey!"
3,"Indulgent, Spritual, and Honest","Eat Pray Love by Elizabeth Gilbert is a spiritual memoir. While at times engaging and interesting, it also tends to be whiny and annoying at times. It is always well written though. If one can get past the first half to two-thirds of the book, the end does pick up a bit. The descriptions of place, food, and moments in time are enticing. Gilbert's honesty about her struggles with meditation and silence will resonate with many readers. Her struggles with indulgences and her vows to herself are honest and raw almost to the point of leaving the reader feeling like a voyeuer."
3,It will make you think,"When I first picked up this book I thought I was reading a novel. It didn't take long to realize this is actually a memoir of sorts. Gilbert is a talented writer and the prose draws you in, the story line is as interesting as real life; that is, not much. However, I had flashes of insight while reading this book and have already recommended it to several friends."
3,Seemed like a long read,"I read this book, expecting to feel some kinship, a-ha moments or something to fill the hype. I didn't find it. I'm glad she wrote it for herself, but that is exactly who she wrote it for, it didn't change my life."
3,It was just ok.,"I saw the movie and enjoyed it, and expected the book to be a lot better, but it actually bored me a bit. It was empowering and uplifting in some parts, but other areas, I felt it was a tad whiny. It did inspire me to look at my own life and ways I could try new challenges."
1,Nothing but words.,"I was so disappointed in this book. What a waste of paper! And my money, too. Liz is so sarcastic and just spilled out meaningless and stupid words. Liz also makes fun of God on just about every page. It made me sick."
1,"Eat too much, pray you have a lot of money, love yourself","I agree with the reviews that express disappointment with Ms Gilbert's Eat, Pray, Love Memoirs. I wanted to like it, especially after hearing the book will be a Film in no time starring one of my least favorite actresses Julia Roberts.But instead I found myself thinking the author was nothing more than a vain, whiney, troubled and empty blogger/journal writer. Her lack of spirituality at the end showed me she is one of the many who think becoming spiritual is something that happens to you after a short trip to India. What frightens me more than this book are the millions of people who look up to her and feel her story is worth repeating.I don't believe Ms Gilbert knows what true suffering is. Nor is she somebody who's advice I would take for anything other than where to eat in Italy."
1,Don't waste your time,"One of the most self-centered, self-indulgent, self-important piece of drivel I've read in a long time. Don't waste your money or time on this."
1,"shallow, boring and poorly written","this woman is seriously annoying. there are moments of her spiritual journey that ring true, but those moments are no great revelation to any reasonably self-aware person. the prose is flat and repetitive and self-indulgent... and so she. the clamor over this book is truly out of control... !"
3,Merely okay....can't understand all the hooplah,"I too read this book for a book group. I expected more. Maybe it was the age level as she is a good 15 years younger than me, but she came across as frivolous and self-absorbed. I love food too but aren't there other aspects to Italy, seat of the Renaissance? I couldn't get over that she didn't even go into Puccini's home, just went to the restaurant across the street. I guess we are supposed to find that funny. And the India/enlightenment section was quite a slog.On the other hand, if you are interested in it from a insider's view of an ashram and of the holistic healing/yoga culture of Bali, it is informative. And her encounters with various expats and spiritual seekers can be pretty entertaining. Just don't expect a fully-informed description of the countries she visited."
2,Mediocre at best,"I really liked the beginning of this book. For a third of it, I was enthralled. Then it slowly began to turn downhill and rapidly degraded into an unfulfilled, uninspiring escapist story. It might be that I'm simply not spiritual enough for the pray and love parts, but I failed to travel along for 2/3rds of the trip."
3,I Helped Pay for this Book!,"Elizabeth Gilbert was paid a handsome advance to spend several months in Italy, India and Indonesia to find her inner peace. Early on, I got the feeling that - by buying Eat Pray Love - I contributed to her self-indulgent journey. Interesting as it was as a travelogue, it never provided an interest in Ms. Gilbert herself. Did she find God? Did she find Inner Peace? Apparently she thought so. Did she move me to sympathy for her troubles or rejoicing in her progress? I'm afraid not."
2,OK,This is the type of book you read when you need to kill time. It is light and fluffy. cute story but no depth
3,Brilliant - but maybe not for everyone,"So, I think the message rings true to you more if you're a, sorry to say it, female. This book, more like a story, is thoughtful, funny, and insightful. It may not be for everyone but I say give it a chance. The author is so honest and you want to reach out and hug her sometimes. There are moments where I am inspired and some where I laugh out loud. I think many woman can relate to her story - and many men too. It's really a story about a person who lived her life the way she thought she should until one day, she could no longer keep it all inside. Her emotions get the best of her, crying every night on the bathroom floor and finally she decides to be brave and make a change. It's painful and easy to relate to. It will inspire others to have courage and you'll laugh along the way too."
5,The best I've Read in Awhile,"I can't say enough about this book. It's insightful, witty, moving, and beautifully written. After reading it, I purchased four more copies to give as gifts and all the recipients have given it enthusiastic praise. I'm not going to go on and on here...just buy this book and be prepared to have your spirit and senses nurtured with Gilbert's delightful prose. One of the best books I've read in a long time."
4,Fun read,"Fun to read, not to serious, wonderfull interesting real life experiences. I read it for a book club it generated some good discussion."
5,Loved this book!,"Easily the best book I've read in a long time. Funny, clever, touching, honest, and relateable. I highly recommend it!"
1,Nice Title,"The only thing about this book that I like is the title. If only I could get a book deal for stories about a few years of my life. But then I am not an upper class, white, blond, female divorcee who ""needs a meal""."
1,Much Ado About Nothing,"I tried, I really tried to get through this boring, self-absorbed thing, but somewhere at mid-point I just said to myself 'enough already!'There are too many good books out there to waste my time! Don't waste yours. I could go on, but even a more detailed review is not time well spent. The book is just not worth it."
1,Big Disappointment,"This book should have been titled ""Eat, Pray, Have Sex"". This journey-through-life book is very pedestrian in its insights and ends up just where every 30-something woman wants it to end. While this is the worst book I ever read, it was among the most disappointing given the reviews that I have read about it."
1,dont waste your $,"It was a gift. Nice title, but seriously? Nothing to write about. She was unhappy, unfullfilled, blamed her husband, had a midlife, got divorced, tried to escape, ran away and went on a spiritual search. But it was all about experiencing me me me me and indulging. In the end empty, unfullfilled, unhappy. Sad really. Yes I know she says she has found herself but thats only till her next meal or ""experience"" is over. I guess the attraction beside a good title is that all of us want to escape from time to time but she was acctually wreckless enough to do it and then write about it and made it sound fun. Really not true LOVE or real spiritual growth in her PRAY found at all. Lots of EAT though. Don't waste your $"
1,Paid in Advance,"It wasn't exactly like she cast her fate to the wind and took off on an adventure. She was paid by a publisher to make this journey and write a book. This wasn't real, it was about money and a business deal. That is why she seemed self absorbed, it is because she is. Don't waste your money on a phony!"
1,Eat Pray and hopefully you aren't as self-entitled as you appear to be.,"I am going to simply state this. This book should have been called ""I ate a lot of pizza. Did nothing for the year. And I just bored the crap out of you"".I saw the movie too. I thought maybe I was missing something. I was hoping to see ""Eat. Pray. I'm not as self-entitled as I appeared to be in the book"", but that didnt' happen either."
3,Witty and Profound,"Eat, Pray, Love.. was a joy to read. Ms. Gilbert is a accomplished writer. I did not know what to expect from this book. What I got was mostly witty and profound. I really enjoyed her humor. Her struggles were real. Her spiritual tranformation was inspirational. I have rarely read a book that didn't provide me with something to think about and some wisdom to take with me. This book was no exception. Saying all this, however, I did have some difficulity with the book. It is hard for a person without the money, fame, success, contacts, etc. of Ms. Gilbert,to relate to a lot of the book. I thought my chances of following in her footsteps quite remote. Ms. Gilbert is obviously a very intelligent women with an amazing grasp of cultural literacy. Some reservations aside, I would recommed this book to a friend."
1,BORING.,"It's rare that I start a book and don't finish it. This book was a struggle to read from the beginning. I saw Gilbert on Oprah, and thought, oh, alright, maybe I'm missing something afterall. I picked up eat pray love again, only to come to my senses and put it down once and for all."
2,"Trite, Inaccurate and Mildly Annoying.","This book reads like a 16 year old girl's diary. The author begins by writing about, in excruciating detail, her divorce and then subsequent breakup with a man she dated shortly after divorcing her husband. Anyone who has been or known a teenage girl needn't read that portion of the book. The rest of the book flits between interesting insights into life, trite commentary and inaccurate anecdotes about religions the author clearly doesn't understand. For example, the author suggests that practitioners of Kabbalah disregard traditional Orthodox Judaism. She also likens the Christian Coalition to the Taliban. I'm really surprised this book got so many good reviews. I found it to be mostly banal at best."
1,"Eat, Pray, Love...Gag","Ms. Gilbert comes across as a most self-absorbed, egocentric person and, beyond this, expects the rest of the world to coo and cluck in pity. Here's a thought: perhaps she should have volunteered with the Peace Corps, Habitat for Humanity, or the International Red Cross. Perhaps this would have lifted her out of her wallowing self-pity and benefited the truly desperate. But wait - of course not. She would never have been advanced the big bucks from her publisher to finance a soujourn in the slums. How I wish I'd contributed the price of this book to charity, instead ... especially since I could not force myself to finish it."
2,Disappointing,"Every self discovery process tends to be a very personal & individualized experience. Not everyone can connect to spiritualized experiences from eating an extra cheese pizza in Italy or a mosquito - ridden meditations in an Indian asharm.A good writer would be able to make an interesting story out of a personal journey. While not every reader would necessarily identify wsith the situation, good writing would help the reader identify with the feelings. humor, or any other element the writer wanted to share while sharing the experience.For me, Elizabth Gilbert hadn't translated her experiences to a well written book that I can identify with. Even as a pizza lover I found her ecstasy over a slice of pizza slightly ridiculous, and found her behavior to be too childish (flying to Bali on some vague offer for lodging by someone who'd forgotten who she was by the time she arrived?)."
2,A fun read,"This is one of those books that someone says ""it's a great book"" and so you go out and buy it. And then you realized that you could have waited until it was in the library or someone lent it to you. It's a fun and quick read but not really anything to write home about."
3,Interesting...but drags on a bit,"I got frustrated with the author after awhile. It is an interesting story, and well written, but I just wanted her to stop complaining!"
2,"Eat, Pray, Love","Basically a ""chick-book"" where we are asked to share the adventures of a recent divorcee as she eats in Italy, prays in India and loves in Indonesia. There are interesting parts to it (for this male reviewer) but I found myself skipping over much of the more emotional gush -- will she or won't she go to bed with her Italian translator. I for one could not care less. But for those who like books where women share their inner thoughts, you could do worse than this."
3,A good read for any woman searching for something more,"I truly enjoyed this book. Is it sappy?..yes, a little. Narcissitic?...maybe, a little. Offensive?...not to me, not even a little.When I read this book I was going through a very difficult time in my own life. While I didn't have the money to take a year off from life, I read this book and allowed myself to be carried off through the authors enlightening journey. I had so many of the same questions, the same thoughts, and too many same experiences sobbing on the bathroom floor.I found the ironic, sarcastic humor funny and perfectly timed and the authors experiences and frustrations with the healing process genuine.This may not be a book all women can enjoy, but if you are in a hard place, struggling to find yourself, exploring spirtuality, or if you just enjoy reading a book about travels to interesting places; keep on open mind and give it a try."
3,"I've seen the bad reviews of this book, but...","My book group (a thoughtful bunch of people) decided not to read this book because, as one member said, ""It's self-centered and trivial."" So I read it on my own.Perhaps Liz Gilbert IS being self-centered as she makes her very personal journey through limited parts of Italy, India and Bali. If that offends you, by all means skip Eat, Pray, Love. On the other hand, her adventures, perceptions and, most of all, joys, are contagious and at times delicious. I tired of her search for God, perhaps because I don't care to look myself. But her experiences with personal revelation and, just as important, characters, food and culture, are a lot of fun.I suggest you read it with a light heart - it's okay to be self-indulgent once in a while, and Liz Gilbert admits several times that she knows she's got it good and is lucky to have this year of self-discovery.I was in no hurry to finish this book, because it was a simple pleasure."
3,Not what I thought,"the first chapter was so, so, The second chapter a little more enlightening, the third, wellllll . Not sure what this book was suppose to inspire me about? Would return it, if possible."
2,Overrated and Self-Absorbed Self-Diary,"Reading this book is like reading someone's private journal - too much self-absorbed thought. I found it hard to relate to someone who disdained both marriage and children, had the financial resources to spend a full year traveling and indulging, and who has no commitment to other human beings - or at least as we're told. Personally I'm amazed she couldn't find God in Italy - the home of the Catholic church, and I got lost in the ashram, but eventually finished it, more out of curiousity than because it held my attention.There are some redeeming qualities towards the end that encourages us to re-evaluate our lives, sort of a stop, look and listen reminder. But all in all, I have yet to figure out the allure of Oprah and all the other outstanding reviews."
4,made me want to travel,Enjoyable book about a woman finding herself again while experiencing life in different countries. I especially enjoyed reading about india and bali.
5,"Worth all the success, fame and big-screen adaptation","Whether or not you agree with Elizabeth Gilbert's religious perspectives or life choices, this much is undeniable: she is a hugely likeable woman. Her way of writing is chatty, confessional and warm-hearted and you never doubt for a second that she really cares for and connects with everyone she crosses paths with. Spiritual journey aside, this is just an amazing adventure for anyone who's ever wished they could just pick up and start again someplace new."
5,AWESOME READ !!,"This is an amazing book, I would suggest it to anyone who loves to read. Also, I would suggest seeing the Movie. In my case I watched the Movie first then decided to read the book!"
2,"Eat, Pray, Love","I grew very tired of the author's whinning. Come on! Most of us have been through a messy divorce, but we don't take a year off to overindulge ourselves and bore everyone else with our self pity!"
2,"Alas, not much here","I regret saying this, but after about thirty pages, I found the book boring. The writing isn't bad, with some nice phrasing and some fun metaphors, but the author's obsession with herself becomes tiresome and comes across as a bit juvenile. I had to laugh at the descriptions of her experiences in the ashram: this is classic ""bliss bunnyism."" Once she's been engaged with contemplative practices for ten or so years, perhaps then she'll have something worth writing about. That this book, like ""The Secret,"" should top best seller lists makes me shudder."
4,"Interesting story, great reader!","Enjoyed this quite a lot. Learned a lot of things about Italy, India and Indonesia that I didn't know before.This is not a novel, nor does it seem like one. It's more of a travel narrative; still quite good to listen to. I especially enjoyed the reader (the author, I believe). She did a great job, which makes all the difference when listening to books on CD."
1,Simply boring.,"I read ""Eat Pray Love"" after a friend recommended it (turned out, she hadn't actually READ the book...). It's slow-moving and boring, and written from the point of view of a self-absorbed and narcissistic spoiled brat of a grown woman. I did finish the book out of principle (hoping that it would be worth it in the end), but wish I hadn't. Don't waste your time when there are so many worthwhile reads out there! Really, this book gets the worst description you can give writing: BORING."
1,overrated,selfindulged author who has very little to add to humanity. it is all about you and not very interesting. may be pictures of the food and scenery could have prevented me from flipping the pages.
1,Perhaps it's unfair to rate a book you couldn't even finish...,"Sorry; I just could not get ""into"" the main character's whiney, self-indulgent frame of mind!Life is tough... it's tougher if you're compulsively looking into a half empty glass. If you like alot of whining, this book (and thus probably the movie) is for you."
3,A little misleading.,"I think I was most disappointed because I was a little misread. The book is not about a woman taking adventures around the world as much as it is a woman avoiding manic depression and suicidal tendencies.She's the neediest woman I've ever heard of and it's unlikely this trip was anything but that: a trip. She'll need medication most of her life, which is very sad but very necessary.I think the Merde series or Brazilian travelogues are superior in their sort of inspirational and magical descriptions of places far away. Even the Thai Detective novels were more enjoyable.In summary, travelling the world with a needy manic depressive is a bit of a drag.Three Stars."
1,worst. book. i. have. ever. read.,"why? why america, why? why have we allowed this kind of mindless tripe to prosper?how is it that american women bought this woman's pretentious monologuing? what has happened to us? how could we have allowed it to happen?this book is FICTION. FICTION dressed up as non-fiction. a ROMANCE NOVEL dressed up as a thoughtful, creative, intelligent commentary. narcissistic pap. worthless drivel. atrocious. i think i am actually 'stupider' for having read it. just stay away from it."
1,"Walk, Skip and then Run away from this one","I don't get it. Why do smart, intelligent, emotionally unstable writers think we might find delight in reading about it? Don't bother. Elizabeth Gilbert is selfish, self-centered and self-absorbed. She knows what she needs to do, doesn't do it and thought it wiser to make money, write a book about the horribly depressing and uninspiring story of her privileged life (no sympathy from me) and laugh at the suckers who bought it and got nothing. Get a life! (I like my motherhood, 20+ year marriage and all the ups and downs that go with husband, kids, pets, homes, jobs, etc.) I won't finish the book and it's the first and last Elizabeth Gilbert book I will ever buy! What a bummer."
5,"Funny, Smart Book!","I loved this book!She writes in a style that is profound and makes you think, all the while being like you are just talking to your best girlfriend! This book made me laugh out loud several times! She writes things in just the most perfect, yet conversational way.It was very interesting to learn about both her journey in life and through the foreign countries I will never be able to visit.I thought her insights were amazing, and her year off was very well spent. I can't wait for her next book!"
3,Dissapointing? Yes. A waste of my time? Definitely not.,"The last section of the book, which takes place in Bali, is definitely worthwhile getting to."
3,Why does no one comment on her hints that she cheated on her husband?,"She hints that there is overlap between her ex-husband and David...why does no one pick up on this? When I read that she was in David's apartment in her India section (page 124), I found it off-putting and had a lot less sympathy for her and her sense of spirtual enlightenment. If in fact she did cheat, then she should stop pitying herself so greatly and stop blaming her husband. This is not to say he did not have wrongs or faults, but I firmly believe if you're not happy and you feel your marriage is over, this is still no excuse for cheating. She should have addressed her own moral perspective on this to give her readers a better perspective into how harshly or kindly to view her moral standards. I did find some of her writing to be a bit too far fetched and perhaps exaggerated in order to sell a book. Otherwise, the book is thought provoking and therefore the level of stars in my review."
2,Pretty Boring,"I would actually give this book two and a half stars. There were some somewhat interesting parts, but overall I found the book to be pretty boring even though I have connections with two of the three countries written about. The section on Italy was the worst of all. There was absolutely nothing of interest there. India was a bit better and my favorite section was on Bali, even though having been there myself I know she is not accurate in everything she says."
3,Mmmmmmmmmm,"Loved the book, was frustrated by it at times as I am not a procrastinator and make quick decisions (sometimes not beneficial) to be honest. I have never felt the need to take a similar journey but I can understand why she did, younger people do these things now. Wouldn't it be fabulous if we could all drop everything and just go on a journey no matter when or where when we experienced a broken relationship and loss of a loved one, heartache or serious illness. It's so sad to think that one has to take such huge steps to find themselves and their spirituality. My mum, who lived through WWII and the depression just sucked it up and did what she had to do to survive while my dad was at war. I would recommend it but to certain people, it's not for everybody."
1,Thumbs Down,"I was extremely disappointed when I read this book I expected so much more then what I received between these pages. This is nothing but a story of a selfish, spoiled rich girl who cares of nothing, and nobody but her self. Plus in the real world most women have lives, family, children or don't have the money to just pick up and travel the world. I would not recommend this book to anyone. But there is one book I would especially recommendWhat is Love?"
2,I really wanted to like this book,"My creative writing teacher showed us a clip of the author speaking. I fell in love with her immediately, and I really wanted to read this book. However, the book was very disappointing. Pretty much the whole thing is about her whining about how miserable her life is and being completely selfish with her friends, monopolizing their time to talk about her problems. She didn't seem to gain a single scrap of wisdom from her entire year of travel, which was the whole point. There were a few good lines and ideas, but most of those came from other people, not from the author. I hoped for a lot more out of this book."
2,EH,"While it was written well enough, I just didn't find her appealing. I didn't feel sorry for her, her journey wasn't incredible to me. In my opinion, she was a typical selfish middle-aged woman nothing to write home about. The book was just ok to me. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it, and I found the book even more boring."
5,"Eat, Pray, Love",This book is absolutely fabulous !!! I enjoyed it sooo much and I've recommended it to anyone I know who reads. The shipment and condition of the book was great.
5,Don't miss this One!,"This book was a total joy! Liz Gilbert writes with honesty, insight and humor. I gave it as a gift to a friend who was embarking on a year of traveling the world, and she couldn't say enough about how wonderful it was. A great read for anyone!"
2,An overrated folly of fanciful fluff.,"I can find diamonds in the rough this book. There are a great many memorable, comical and/or insightful quotes. However, mostly I'm thinking that Elizabeth Gilbert is certifiably insane. She can write, there's no doubt about that. It's just what she chooses to write about that gets my hackles up. Her neurotic over analysis of her life gets tedious really fast. If I wanted to relive a metaphysical crisis, I'd write my own memoir, thank you very much. I keep wondering how they turned this festival of self indulgent, self loathing into a movie. I probably should have saved myself the trouble and watched it instead of investing my time in reading the book."
3,why the hype?,"I purchased this book on my Kindle, based on all the hype about the book and the movie was just coming out. Problem was, I read the whole book with the voice of Julia Roberts in my head. So that was kinda weird. Then, I quickly realized that this author was relating a story that average 'folks' really can't relate to and it was tiresome to hear how fantastic and amazing she is. Apparently there is no financial boundary for this author, so coupled with the mental picture of Julia Roberts, I got pretty sick of it at the end. It's still kind of interesting, but be prepared to deal with the ""me"" overload."
1,The privilege of the privileged.,"I got through three quarters of this book before I finally said enough. I returned the book to the lender thankful that I had not purchased it. I found it to be a tale about self-importance and the privilege of the privileged. If you're looking for inspiration or a spiritual journey, read ""Three Cups of Tea"" by Greg Mortenson."
2,Tedious,"I'm having a hard time getting through this book. I think that's because the book is about four years old and what was new and interesting in 2006 just isn't that exciting in 2010. I've read too many blogs that read like this and I don't find her ideas, thoughts and feelings all that profound. Maybe the movie is better, but the reviews said otherwise. Save your money, read something else."
2,"Eat, Pray, Love","I didn't really care for this book. It does give some insight into different cultures around the world. But, I am a Christian and disagree with her view of religion. The romantic will enjoy portions of the book, but overall it was just not what I expected."
2,Selfishness as a career,"In summary: This is a book about an extremely selfish woman who then proceeds to inflict long-term damage on the men who have the misfortune to love her and expect her to behave like an adult. Then she gets to write a book about it and make lots of money. I just cannot have any sympathy for Ms. ""woe-is-me"" Gilbert. I felt more for the men she steamrolled over in her ""quest."""
3,Read with a grain of salt,"2.75 starsI was really excited to finally have the free time to devote to finishing this book, and I can't express how much of a let down it was! I'm not normally a skeptical reader, but I kept wondering throughout the entire story if certain ""true"" parts of the story were embellished or even completely made up. Parts of Gilbert's story were definitely interesting and entertaining, and other parts were equally selfish, self-righteous and boring. Maybe it was all the hype surrounding this book that ultimately left a sour note with me. Maybe I just couldn't believe in Gilbert's journey. This story definitely isn't for everyone, but the only way to really know if you'll enjoy it is to read it for yourself."
4,Likable and Interesting,"I am kind of confused by the reviews I have been reading here on Amazon. The book delivered exactly what it said it would deliver. The subtitle alone is ""One Woman's Search for Everything...."" It's not every woman's/person's search. Maybe you all don't find that you can relate to her journey because its very self-absorbed? Its a memoir. How can it not be?I appreciated reading about her unique journey and attempt to heal herself of her very personal struggles/pain. I can even relate to some of them. Not all of them. And yes, India was kind of tough to get through at times. Maybe because I am not super interested in the type of meditation she practiced or really, meditation in general. But, I still enjoyed reading it and learning something new.To blame her for being self-indulgent seems redundant because I don't think she would really argue with you. If anything, that was her intention."
3,On The Fence,"I was really excited to read this book. The first 1/3 of the book (in Italy) was great. It made me want to run away to Italy! Very descriptive and inviting. I'm almost done with the second section (India). Early on in the book, you discover that she is traveling on the proceeds from the advance of this book. She talks about her lovely home with her husband and other properties they own. She lives a very entitled, elitist life and then decides she doesn't want to be in her marriage any longer. She talks about how people need to follow their dreams, etc. Well, not everyone can do that.....so, I can't really relate to her. I don't consider her as a person who has had to struggle. I do love the way the book is written and I will finish it. Now, I am looking forward to reading ""A Thousand Splendid Suns"" by Khaled Hosseini. I'm sure there is no phony feeling sorry for yourself characters in that book!"
1,"Too many books, too little time to read this one!","We tried to read this in my book club. It was almost unanimous. We all got throught the Eat part and thought it was fine. The Pray part was painful and only a few of us were diehards and ended up reading the Love section or parts of it. I don't understand why this book is so popular unless it is the title and cover. It was one of those books where I thought of all the other great books I could have read while I was wasting my time reading this one. Too many books, too little time to read this one."
4,Good,"This book is a good read, that gets better as you go along. It was a little tough for me to get into at first but I stuck through and have enjoyed it."
2,Kinda boring!,This book was really slow in parts especially in the middle - and kind of boring. It was not what I expected. It did get better towards the end.
2,Didn't engage the audience,"To see great stories about physical/emotional/spiritual journeys, read ""Unbroken"" or watch ""The Way"" or ""The Way Back"". This movie had great potential but just didn't reach into my soul and grab me."
3,Hard to get through,"It has taken me a year and a half to get through this book.There were some passages that seemed so profound that I wanted to highlight them so I could reread when I was feeling in need of some spiritualism. Other parts (interestingly enough India - a place I'd love to visit) were almost impossible to get through.I have the book quite a break in the middle of the pray section, and have finally finished.I am glad to took the time, because the last section bring's the author the understanding she has been looking for and love.Now if I could only figure out how to take a year off work, to travel and find myself!"
2,didn't like it,"Irritating and wordy, straordinario, my favorite Italian word, does not describe this book. A tale I could only barely get through a third of, about an insecure, neurotic, gluttonous and self-absorbed woman who is basically trying to make herself (and others apparently) even more sick of herself. It's overwrought and self aggrandizing ... 'when i'm an old lady, i wanna be like Rome' ...? ok. Gilbert, and how crafty it was, 'used' a mala as a model of construction. For a journey of identity discovery, enough of it seems a bit second hand with paths already too well beaten to be authentic. I think i will aver - traverse ..."
2,What enlightenment?,"So many people have said they read this book, but often I discover most of them could not get past Italy and never finished the book. I really found it difficult to finish this book myself. I did not find the writing style to be particularly clever or witty. I could not connect to the self-absorbed author. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Too much whining,"While I loved the concept and trips abroad, there was simply too much whining about her ex husband even though she is the one who left him!"
1,Kindle Rip Off - Penguin needs to learn how to treat customers,"This has been on my ""to read"" list for awhile and I should have bought it when the Kindle version was $6.50 - yes - 1/2 the price it is now (just 2 months ago even!)!!! Penguin has increased all the Kindle prices that for now, I will wait for the library to get it back and not give them anymore of my money. I am disappointed that I can't read it on my Kindle which I really much rather prefer, but not until this publisher learns a little bit more about customer service. The fact that the Kindle version is $4 MORE than a paperback version really chaps my hide!!"
1,"Not a good, or healthy, read...","This book should have been titled: ""IT'S ALL ABOUT ME!!!!"" All I can say is I cringed to have to even give it a single star. I thought this book was going to be enlightening on some level, but instead it is about a narcissistic individual unhappy with life because, well, it just doesn't make her happy. Waaaa-waaaaa-waaaaa! If only everybody had the money to jump on airplanes, explore life, and live strictly for themselves when things didn't quite provide enough pleasure, excitement, or satisfaction, but that's not how life plays out. Sometimes you have to give a little. Life is NOT about us, it's about making a difference in someone else's life and watching the impact you can make for good. This book is a clear example of how a person can go in search of the WORLD and still not find true contentment."
1,Pretentious,"Got it as a gift (M, if you are reading this, sorry, no offense!), which is why I even read the few pages that I did read of it - I couldn't get past some 12 pages or so. I normally finish any book that I pick up, unless I just can't bear the narrative style as well as the theme - unfortunately this book falls in the unbearable category.Obviously from the 5-star reviews here and from feedback from some of my friends, some people really ""connect"" with it.. I simply don't understand their view point on this one.The title itself suggests a sort of ""self-help"" book, preachy and pseudo-spiritual. Honestly, traveling to India on a spiritual quest has become an over-used cliche. Not sure if the author discovered anything of herself or spirituality in her travels - from the sound of the other reviews here, she did not! Glad I did not waste the time reading it fully."
2,Sometimes not much love.........,"I was somewhat enjoying Ms. Gilbert's book until pg 48 when she insulted Republicans by saying ""they"" stole a Presidential election. I was appalled by this. I am a certified yoga instructor and that is why I wanted to read this book, especially the part about India. During my yoga training, my fellow students had totally different political beliefs and opinions. We respected each other's right to have individual opinions -- something sadly missing in Ms. Gilbert's book. There are more digs about Republicans and conservative Christians throughout this book - which is completely antithetical to the practice of yoga and prayer. I was very disappointed by these cheap shots, and her assumptions and arrogance that her readers would agree with her."
2,self absorbed...,a self-absorbed portrayal of one year in the life of a woman recovering from a divorce. i could not get past the whining and one person pity party.
1,"Eat Pray and Love better known as Whine, Indulge Myself and Still Complain","This book was selected by our book club. Our club reads a variety of books, from classics to historical fiction. The book we read prior to EPL was What is the What by Dave Eggers, which was a gripping, emotional and sometimes diffucult read because of the real tragedy that Valentino Achak Deng had experienced. Proceed from that great read to Eat, Pray and Love. Our group in its entirety really hated the book. We could not appreciate the insight and humor that the author was trying to convey because all she did was cry, complain and whine. We heard it was a great read, but our group gave it a 100% thumbs down. The best part about our club meeting that night was the book inspired dessert and the iced tea served in jelly jars."
1,You have got to be kidding,"Save yourself the money and the time and don't bother. If I could bail out on my family, friends and my job to meditate in a cave in India for four months, I would probably find some peace too. I found her to be very self absorbed and self centered. I spent more time saying to my self ""give me a break"" and ""when is she going to get over her self"", than actually getting anything meaningful out of this book. This book came highly recommended to me, so I was thrilled to see I was not the only one who felt they have also lost several hours of their life that they will sadly never get back. This truly is one of the worst books I have ever read."
1,relentless drivel,"I tried reading past the point of Italy but i couldn't. the vague nature at which she describes the end of her marriage leaves me suspicious of her and her motivation. this is a book, this is YOUR BOOK. this book is supposed to be about YOUR spiritual journey as a result of YOUR DIVORCE and circumstances that surround the journey you've chosen to share, how could you not what to talk about that? impossible! reading this made me so upset.overall, i came to the realization that any drivel can be published and, if marketed right, become successful. I have never returned a book but i did return this one, and the attendant didn't seem very surprised to see it back."
1,Very disappointing,"I was surprised at how disappointing this book was. I lived in Italy for over 5 years and was really looking forward to reading a book that might capture the essence of living in and experiencing Italy. I agree with other reviews that the author's insights are actually annoying, cliche, ""pat"" (used this way: so glibly plausible as to seem contrived [...], cloying, superflous, shallow, and just fake. I have read better books by expatriates of true Italian experiences, insightful, inclusive, with depth and true self-discovery and growth (the book, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"", by Frances Mayes (long before the movie came out) or ""An Italian Education"" by Tim Parks. And yes, I'm only reviewing the Italian section, because its something I know about, and its as far as I can get. BAD READ!!"
1,you will never get those hours back spent reading this!,"i was lent this book from my best friend that i adore - it was her favorite. it couldn't be bad right? fast forward to me wanting to stick a sharp object in my own eye to end the pain of reading this book. if you want to experience whining about nothing, this is the book for you. i finally had to admit to my friend that i hated the book and the woman in it. she told me to skip to the bali part of the book (the last third) and it did get a little better (we had vacationed there before). but i think that was because she finally stopped complaining about nothing which made it more tolerable. i would say all men, before entering a relationship with a woman, ask if she liked this book and then go running if she did. except for my best friend of course!"
5,"Marvelous, Educational & Fun","A perfect vacation read, but good anytime. I liked it so much I bought it for my daughter, daughter-in-law, and 3 best girlfriends."
2,Surprised it was a bestseller...,"I'm surprised this book was a bestseller. The premise of the book is very interesting but I agree with other reviewers that the author is self-absorbed, immature and seriously lacking self esteem. I can't believe how selfish and self-centered this woman is!! She gives the stereotype, that women are neurotic, validity. It's a good thing she doesn't want children because she definitely shouldn't have any. As a conservative new mom, I found her views on motherhood and politics semi-offensive and irritating. That being said, I thought SOME of the book was well written and humorous. I found a lot of her spiritual ""exploration"" to be irritating but it did make me think about my own spirituality. And I did enjoy the historical and cultural information she included, written with a nice twist. If you are trying to pass a rainy day, it's not the worst book to read. There were parts of the book that were difficult to get through but overall it's a pretty ""easy read""."
2,I don't get it,"I don't understand all the hoopla over this book. I have tried two different times to get through it and CANNOT. It's so boring. People rave and rave and say it's fabulous but I just don't understand. I've only made it to India and can't stay awake. And I read and LOVED LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA which was slow...but good, intriguing, had a plot. So I can get through books others find boring. I gave it two stars because I didn't finish - one star is a freebie for the part I didn't read."
5,Great,Great - the book is what I thought it would be. Shipping was on time and got here in perfect shape. Thanks - A+
3,Loved Story & Movie,"I really enjoyed this story about another woman's journey to find herself after giving too much of herself over to marriage which left her not knowing who she is anymore...as women we tend to fill roles to the fullest extent leaving us all too often feeling empty and becoming someones daughter, mother, wife etc which is wonderful until the marriage ends or changes and the children leave home. I found the book difficult to read at times as it rambles on in places there was no need...just not very well written I thought but overall I loved this journey she shared with us and thoroughly enjoyed the movie."
2,Eat Pray Love,"I was very disappointed in the book especially after seeing the author on The Oprah Show. Most of the audience along with Oprah ""gushed"" over the book and I felt I just had to read it and give it to my daughter. I forced myself to read and finish it and wondered the whole time---what is the point???Too much hipe!!!! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,HUH???,"I just got online to read the reviews for this book. I have to admit, I am floored. I LOVE my Kindle, BUT THE KINDLE PRICE IS HIGHER THAN THE PAPER VERSION? HUH?"
1,Reading this book was just a waste of time and money!,I really expected a lot more from this author as her book was advertised all over and became popular. I thought it can teach me something I don't know. But the whole thing was about this woman's shallow thoughts and feelings here and there and her boring journey with her exaggerating some unimportant happenings in her life and making an annoying cliche out of them. I forced myself to finish this book and could easily throw it in the garbage afterwards. I don't recommend it to anyone.
1,Terrible Terrible Terrible,"This was just awful. I echo the views of many who found her to be just self-absorbed and whiny. There are gimmicky silly devices all over everywhere (e.g., I've changed the names of everyone, oh but not of this Texan chappie, ok almost everyone; and I've omitted mentioning my spiritual guru in India because, well, I'm sure he doesn't want the publicity...).I also could not bring myself to finish this..."
1,This Book Sucks,"The metaphors are tired and obvious, and the author is painfully shallow--even the premise shows her lack of depth and understanding: she's wants to combine spirituality and materialism; clearly, she just doesn't get it. And she admits that the whole point of her travels was her desire to write a book; it's not like she traveled and THEN decided to write it. I can't believe (some) people like this book. I had to force myself to finish it, and I hated the author during the entire experience. Don't waste your time."
1,Get over it and grow up,"I wanted to shake the author and tell her to grow up. I was so annoyed by her and her whining while reading this book that I almost didn't finish it. Had it not been a selection for a book club, I would never have spent the time on it. She was so self-centered that I could not handle it."
4,New Age personality seeks meaning in life...,"I enjoyed reading Ms. Gilbert's account of her travels and experiences. She writes really well and is very entertaining. However, I found the extremes she went through to quell her emotional pain and find her center well outside of the ""norm"" (I mean how many of us can take a year off to travel the world because we've had a divorce or breakup with a significant other?) and a little ridiculous for a grown women if you ask me, but to each his/her own, I guess. If you're not looking for anything too spiritual or enlightening, this is a good read. Just hearing about all of the customs and characters is fasinating. If it were a movie, it would definitely be a ""Chick Flick."""
4,Very enjoyable book,"I heard about this book being discussed on the Gail King XM radio show several months ago and was intrigued by the interview. Having been through a divorce and walking through an airport on my weekly business travels, I purchased the book on a lark. I found the book amazingly easy to read and quite enjoyable. Liz Gilbert's ability to take you through her divorce and subsequent worldwide travel to only find her true inner-self was truly uplifting and entertaining."
2,I can't finish this book...,"Having heard so many positive reviews of this book, I really, really wanted to like it. I have been struggling through every page of her narcisistic babble and have finally decided I can't go on. I made my decision upon reading last night that she had decided to stay another 3 months in India. I think my exact words were, ""Oh dear God, you've got to be kidding me."" I can't do another 3 months in India with her...I think I'll lose my mind.The ONLY reason I am giving this 2 stars is because the Italian portion of the story piqued my interest enough that I am now more interested in learning more about the Italian language and making Italy my next travel destination."
1,grow up,"Elizabeth Gilbert turns 35 during her year of self absorbed indulgence. Her time in Italy read more like that of a run away teenager eating, drinking and lusting for Italian men while missing the great opportunity to study the ancient civilization, art, religion and culture that exists in Rome. In India she talks obsessively about ""her guru"" (who we never meet) and the difficulty to unselfishly be introspective. Bali shows Elizabeth having so much sex she must reach for her collection of antibiotics. Her behavoir is immature and reckless. And, of course, she did all this on the publisher's dime - imagine had she genuinely taken this journey, kept diaries and THEN pitched it to her publisher."
2,Maybe I'm biased because I didn't like the narrator,"In a book like this you need to have empathy for the lead/subject. I couldn't find it in me. I know she addresses this but, yes, she does sound spoiled. And my lack of connection to her spoiled the book for me. Good for her for living her dream and her success. But the book isn't much of anything."
5,Made me re-access myself and my view of life.,"I read Eat, Pray, Love a couple years ago so I'm a little rusty on my details of the book, but it still affects the way I look at the world today. It helped me be ok with treating myself to good things. I started taking myself out on dates to bakeries and coffee houses to sit, read a book, or just stare out the window and think about how wonderful the pastry tastes. I try to make time everyday to take care of my physical and spiritual life also. Elizabeth Gilbert taught me how to appreciate myself and prioritize in this book. It is not a self-help book, but it has their effects on your life if you try to feel what she is in her journey. Very good read if you need some extra happiness in your life, or if you just want to read a good story."
3,"Love the concept, hate the writing","It took me a really long time to get through this book and not because I didn't have time to read it. I feel like it would be easy to dislike Elizabeth Gilbert after reading the book. Like other readers I found her to be a little too whiny and selfish for my taste and literally had to force myself to pick up the book and finish it but I tried to get over this initial reaction and look at the book from a different perspective. It takes a lot of guts to take a year off and travel to different parts of the world the way she did (and alone I might add!). Not everyone would be able to just pick up and leave. Sometimes we all need a fresh start and this was her way of coping so in that sense, I admire Elizabeth for having the courage to pick up the pieces and start over again. Overall, the concept of this book is very interesting. I think I could have enjoyed the book a little more if she wasn't such a drama queen."
2,"Average, boring book",I am half-way through the book and I am finding it: boring. There really is nothing to it. Don't waste your money.
2,decent book but...,"Live Like A Fruit Fly, a book i recently found on amazon, cuts to the chase much faster and is far more practical."
5,Good advise for those in search of themselves,"I have been trying to find myself for as long as I can remember, and it wasn't until reading about Elizabeth Gilbert's own experiences, that I found words that mimicked my own thoughts. It was refreshing to read the thoughts, no matter how trivial, and the need for something greater than us. I myself have been struggling with the spiritual side of life and I thought the book helped put things in perspective I never would have on my own. While I am still a long ways from being ""enlightened"" but I have a better understanding of myself and a better idea of what my next steps are. I am so very glad I read this book and while I realize some people do not like it, I for one love it. To each their own."
4,Not as cheesy or corny as I expected!,"My mother read this book before I did and I made plenty fun of her: ""What the hell is this cheesy cornball crap you're reading?! Is it more like Eat, Pray, Hurl?"". Of course now I'm eating my words. I was bored one day and picked it up, started reading it in a very half assed manner, but was quickly reeled in by the author's very honest and fun prose. I enjoyed the book immensely, plowing through it like an out of control tractor. Entertaining, fun, and even life changing."
4,slow at times,"I enjoyed the read although sometimes it really dragged, particularly her time at the Yoga retreat in India. The time she spends in Italy though, doing nothing but indulging herself with food is a riot."
1,Could not finish it,"I tried to like this book... I wanted to like this book... I could not finish this book. The only thing I appreciated was her sense of humor at times. She seems self-centered and completely unaware of others needs. I really question her great ability to make friends. On one level I can see that she could be a great person to have at a party with many entertaining stories etc. but I define ""friend"" differently -she doesn't seem like she would be a dear faithful friend, someone you could count on in times of trouble (although I'm sure she'd make it for the good times). She seems unstable and flighty. It is probably a wise decision for her not to have children. Also in regards to her husband... sounds like a very painful time for him but it's probably for the best that she's moved on. I hope he can heal and find peace."
3,No Nirvana Will Be Found Here.,"I thought this was a memoir? It often came across as shallow narcissism to the point of wondering if it was fiction? Despite, the fine descriptions & a bit of wit. The author was clearly basting herself in a bath of self pity. All three parts seemed like an extended escape from her chaotic life back in the USA., where she went through a divorce. In brief, she needed to find herself & wanted to feel special. She ate well in Italy, practiced meditation in India, & in Indonesia tried to balance herself between selfindulgence & seeking Nirvana through more meditation. She clearly is unhappy & probably needs something other than her anti-depressants to help herself? I give it three stars because, it was a short descriptive read. But, in conclusion this was far more sad than inspirational."
1,Read Why I Will Not See the Movie Either,"There's been so much hype about this book since the impending movie release, I finally decided to try it. I should have read the reviews first. I, too, did not like it. I found this to be a self-centered, childish, insipidly-boring story that is going to be brought to screen, perhaps appropriately, by a mediocre, highly-overrated actress. Sorry, but that's just how I feel about the book and the actress. (Both ladies might be very nice people, I don't know, I'm only talking about the talent here.) Will I see the movie - no way! Do I recommend the book - big no!"
2,"Eat, Pray, Go Home","This is my first taste of chick lit. I enjoyed immensely EATing, found PRAYing ponderous and self-important, and found LOVE just odd. So our heroine who speaks no Indonesian befriends a Balinese woman and then writes to her myriad of wealthy friends and buys her a house! Our heroine has a serious Santa Claus syndrome. What will the effect of acts like this be on your ordinary Balinese meeting foreigners? When I was in Nepal and American couple became so found of their Nepali porter that they brought him to live with them for a year. Santa Claus!Soon Bali will face a tsunami of EPL carrying divorcees bring their emotional baggage. I am in Ubud and I see them now and they want to buy villas. One woman I met has followed in our heroine's footsteps, spending four months in Italy, India and now Bali. The medicine man has been overrun with needy women hoping that he will provide them with a special someone. All I can say is that there is a lot of suffering out there."
4,Amazing.,"When I bought this I expected to read a good book, to maybe smile or laugh now and then.What I didn't expect was to yearn for the same spiritual journey and understanding that Gilbert wrote about. She did an incredible job sharing her experiences, so that I was torn between feeling as though I was really there at the Ashram or desperately wishing I was.More, I wanted to meet the people she met - that's how well-portrayed her characters were. I'll be first in line for her next book."
4,Unusual and kept my interest,"I pretty much enjoyed this book. It captured my imagination though, at times, I sort of found myself wanting more...or more accurately, something else. Well written but a difficult combination of subjects to cover in one book."
5,A Journey Through the Internal Landscape,"What a beautiful book... a touching and evocative story. The author has such a commanding and light-hearted voice, there's something very strong and feminine about Gilbert's writing style.I'd recommend this to anyone who's ever gone through heartbreak and questioned the meaning of life."
3,Self-deprecating Humor,"Journey of discovery on 3 continents. The style of writing reminds me of ""The Nanny Diaries"" - light and comedic. I am enjoying that!There's been so much said about this wildly popular book. I especially enjoyed the author's self-deprecating humor, even making the most depressing things seem funny and tolerable. A good read."
3,okay read,"It was a good book that kept a smile on my face throughout. I would consider the book cute but not that great read you're looking for. I think it was written well, but disliked the movie. Not a book I would read twice."
5,"Eat, Pray, Love","I'm an elderly lady - 94, and sometimes have insomnia. I ordered ""Eat, Pray, Love"" on my Kindle reader for a preview, & decided it would be a worthwhile read. So I ordered it & read ""Eat, Pray, Love"" in the middle of the nights when I couldn't sleep, and found it interesting & entertaining. So glad it had a happy ending!"
1,Worthless,"This book is drivel, a waste of time, and garbage.Elizabeth Gilbert is odious, hedonistic, and as far from spiritually enlightened as I can imagine. She starts as a needy, dependent woman who is obsessed with men, and she ends at the exact same point. What a great transformation.This book made me cynical."
2,there's just too much of blah blah...,"I had refused to read this book for its best-seller status fully supported by Oprah... However, I decided to read it when it was given to be by my friend. I don't think it was a complete waste of time but do think that this book's acclaimed fame and popularity are complete nonsense. She's self-absorbed, self-obsessed, exaggerating and self-acclaimed guru. I admit I did read this entire book. When finished reading it, I was like, ""so??????"" ""So what??????"" ""What is this???"" ""Did this women finally finish with her blah-blahs, which really don't amount to anything but blah-blahs?""I'm giving 2 stars only because of my ability/willingness to read this entire book.I can only imaging how insecure and unhappy you have to be in order to be inspired? by her blah-blahs, idolize this woman, and then rate this book 3 stars or more."
2,Disappointing,"I am listening to the audiobook version of this (which is narrated by Elizabeth herself).So far the odds of me finishing this book are not looking good. I feel as though several times a chapter I want to tell this woman to shut up. Stop babbling on and on about your personal attributes and how well you can make friends, what color your hair is, what your boring, normal childhood was like. I find no inspiration whatsoever in this story. Her humor is not funny to me and has actually made me cringe several times.To sum up, I feel that this COULD have been an amazing journey through words. But the author (and her editors) really missed the mark on this, getting too caught up in the author's narcissistic ramblings and not sharing the beauty and spirit of her travels.Very disappointing."
3,"funny, but somewhat of a history lesson in parts","I enjoyed this book for the most part. I loved Italy, thought India was something out of a history book (more educational than a personal account), and ended it with the semi-funny Indonesia. As I read Italy I thought, ""I'd recommend this witty book!,"" but as I read on, I decided that I wouldn't. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy learning about other cultures, but I thought the amount of history was a tad overwhelming."
4,"EAT, PRAY, LOVE","A WONDERFUL INSIGHT TO A WOMANS HEART AND SOUL. I LOVED THIS BOOK. SOMETIMES A LITTLE REDUNDANT, ESPECIALLY IN INDIA....BUT IT TRULY WAS A JOURNEY."
3,slow read,"I enjoyed the first part of this book, it was very enjoyable, but the second and third part was kind of boring."
4,Finding oneself,"This is a very good book and gives an interesting view of life abroad in Italy, India, and Indonesia. Elizabeth goes to these three countries in that order and there she finds balance and gets to know herself much more personally. Parts of this book are painful and other parts are blissful and in the end there is balance. Now what to read?"
2,"Indulge, Gaze at Your Navel, Obsess","This book starts off well; it is well written, poignant, humorous, and insightful. Somewhere before the end of Italy though, Elizabeth Gilbert goes from all these lovely and positive traits to a person bent on proving that she deserves to have whatever the heck it is she wants. In fact, we should all do ourselves the favor of becoming self absorbed and selfish.And that is the journey that Gilbert suffers us on. She deserves a break today and everyday and sets out to figure out, ""What does Elizabeth want."" Period.And really how terrific is that, an advance for a book, this book, telling all of us how to achieve selfishness, like we need told, duh.I really enjoyed the first third of the book, but Gilbert gets to be so full of herself, her wisdom, her desires that is just got b-o-r-i-n-g."
3,"Not too good, not too bad","I did not have any troubles finishing this book, although the Italian trip was the best part for me. I admire the author's ability to write about her ""overactive"" mind with such candor but sometimes there is too much detail. I liked the historical/geographical/yoga details in the book and the fact that she met and interacted with a lot of interesting people, although her story seemed too self-centered here and there. It was an acceptable reading overall but I think with some editing it could have been much better."
3,Entertaining,I listened to the book. I think it was more entertaining that way since the author did the reading. Book club gave it 3 out of 4 stars.
4,life-altering.,This book changed my life! Everyone should read it. It was the book that started my current book club!
2,"Narcissistic, Annoying, and Too Girly","I'm not sure who started the hype about this book, but it's not true. While the author's storytelling is witty and funny, this does not make up for the narcissism of a relatively spoiled woman who happened to encounter a kink in her life (a bad relationship). Rather than doing anything that could help better the world with the year she is given to take off and write this book, she spends her time fussing over a cute boy or two in Italy, obsessing over exactly how to meditate in India, and justifying the break from her self-imposed year-long fast from sex while she's in Indonesia. The Pray section of the book is the most annoying, and I would have stopped reading the book altogether had I not promised the girlfriend who gave me the book that I would read it. The book lacks any depth (emotional, cultural, or otherwise), and inspires its readers to nothing but their own self-centeredness. The only thing going for it is the author's wit."
4,Wonderfully refreshing and thought-provoking,"I met Elizabeth Gilbert in 1997 and have been following her career ever since her first novel. As an American expat who has lived for almost 11 years in Germany as well as spent several months in Israel, I was excited to hear about this novel of her trip around the world. I enjoyed every minute of reading the book, even if some of the passages particularly around spirituality and finding God are a bit long-winded. This is a wonderful story of travel and transformation. You feel so free while reading it, as if you too had a year off to travel and find yourself. The novel gives everyone much to think about of your own spiritual being.I definitely recommend it, particularly for people that have lived abroad for more than a few weeks."
1,Lost sale for Amazon and Penguin,"As has become my practice, if I see a book featured that looks intriguing I immediately log on to my iPad and download it. But as I always do I looked at the cost of other editions, confident in the knowledge that the savings in printing and distribution cost translate into a saving for me. But No, in this case I and all others are being ripped off as the dinosaurs at Penguin defend their printing businesses by cross subsidizing them from eBooks."
2,Surprise - you are in control of your life....,"A re-count of the author's year spent in Italy, India, and Bali in the wake of a difficult divorce. This book is easy to read and enjoyable. The author does an excellent job of providing her outlook on the variety of experiences she has + how they relate to her dealing with her ""life issues."" She eventually comes to the self-actualizing realization that she is in control of her life (as opposed to anybody else) and takes steps to make herself happier."
1,Not a Fan of the Book...,"Not even close! I was so excited to read this book. But even as I *trudged* through Italy, I knew I wouldn't, couldn't finish it. I think i gave up somewhere in India, so i have no idea what happened in Indonesia, and i don't even care. There are sooooooo many more, much better written, literary masterpieces out there. Why would I want to spend my precious time on this drivel? Self-serving, self-involved and self-important...that's how this author comes across in this book."
1,self-indulgent writing - should have been a blog not a memoir,"the first 10 or so pages were ok, after that I had to do employ extreme ahistorical empathy to get through it."
1,Very Disappointed,I ordered this book on 7/21. It is 8/22 and I still have not received it. I emailed seller and have not even received a response.
4,Read it and think about your life,"I read Eat, Pray and Love. It was a fun ready to read and insightful book. It can very quickly and in great condition. There is another i heard that is called Women food and something else. It makes you evaluate your life and what you have always said you wanted to accomplish versus what you have actually accomplished. It makes you evaluate the people in your life and makes you want to eliminate anyone in your life that is not loving, kind and supportive to you. I want to see the movie to compare how it is in regards to the book. This is one you will want to read and find hard to put down."
1,Skip it,"If you like neurotic self-involved women who never know how to gain control of their lives, this book is for you. If not, just pass this by. I know she won all kinds of awards from her other books, but this is full of whining and self-pitty. In fact it feels so thin it feels like the notes she took for the article she wrote for a magazine. I couldn't even get past the first section and I'm a huge reader."
1,The Title is Deceiving,"Will not continue to read this book! The title is deceving, how can one give it this title? When she says the (F) word. I will not recommend this book to anyone. So glad I didn't see the movie either. I will never read this authors books."
2,"okay, if you need something to read - don't go out of your way, though","I agree with the previous reviewer that said that this book is very over hyped . I heard the author interviewed on NPR and thought the book sounded mildly interesting but wouldn't have read it unless two of my friends recommended it. From page 1, I felt that the author used way too many words to express very little in terms of content. She goes on and on, tries really hard to entertain us, and it shows. The section on meditation was illuminating -- she said she had monkey mind, which made total sense because that's exactly how she writes . It's still an entertaining book, but not a great book; there are a lot of better books around ."
1,Worst Read Ever,"This review should be zero stars. I had such high hopes for this book, but I only finished it because it was our book club's selected reading. The constant whining and crying (good gracious, in what country is she sobbing now?) was almost too much to bear. Never have I read a story by such a self-centered, narcissistic author who genuinely believes her readers should have some sympathy for her. I whole-heartedly agree with all of the other reviewers in their descriptions of the disaster that this book is. Save your money and don't bother with this book."
1,Kindle Price Ridiculous,I can buy the book at Costco for 8.99 and then resell it. I will never pay $12.99 for a Kindle book.
1,liberal agenda,"Readers beware...a complete liberal agenda...why can't authors just write the sroty and leave out their politcal agendas. Besides being a liberal freak she is wordy self absorbed and out of touch pathetic female. Boring, boring book...mine is in the trash to make sure no one else happens to pick up and is tempeted to read."
3,Some slow spots,"Overall I enjoyed this book (esp. the Eat and Love parts), but the Pray third can drag on."
1,Waste of time!!!,"Thankfully, I borrowed this book from a friend so it didn't cost me any money. But it did cost me lots of time! I actually stopped reading it after the second part of the book and getting through that was absolute torture. The author is just so freakin' WHINY! Like a 5-year-old.To save you some time, read all the 1-star reviews on this page because they are 100% accurate!!!!!!! I wish I read them before I opened the book."
4,Fun Read,"What a fun fast read Eat, Pray, Love is. I really enjoyed it. Had some slow parts in the middle, but overall I thought it was a great story."
4,Good Book,It is a good book so far. I have not gotten as far into it as I would like. the short chapters make me feel as if I have accomplished something. This book will make a good argument paper for my AP LANG class.
4,it was mind opening,"I really enjoyed this book, in the being i found myself judging the character a little bit; but once I got deeper in the book and her journey it just opens your mind a little, how many people often settle for where there at, it was inspiring to see her just make those changes and share are experiences with her; i really enjoyed the final trip indonesia, it had a great combination of humor."
1,Everything and more.,"Okay, so the ending was a little schmultzie...or maybe I'm just envious...but the book was terrific, inspirational, motivational, transformational, ya-da, ya-da, ya-da. Oh yeah, and it was funny, too. I'm on my second time through, bought it for a gift and have recommended it to many. Enjoy!"
3,A good read but alot of hype why?,"It is interesting to journey with her but I find it really hard to get engrossed in a book that everyone is ""raving"" about.... I try to keep my nightstands reads to myself until I am done."
1,Self-Absorbed Drivel,"OMG .. what self-absorbed drivel. I am amazed at women who are impressed by this vapid piece of work. The author is a shallow harpy with whom I couldn't have less in common. I can't relate to any of her stupid observations or solipsistic epiphanies. I don't begrudge her not wanting children. It's probably best that women like this don't procreate. It was a massive waste of time to spend MY TIME with a woman whose world ends at the tip of her own nose. What a bore. Don't be fooled into thinking this is even a mildly well-written or amusing piece. It is a text book study in what's wrong with many so-called ""sophisticated urbanites"" today."
1,A litmus test for out-of-it,"I really hesitate to write a review for this book, much less admit I read it. I consider it sort of ""slumming,"" as if I was caught rubber-necking with all the others to see what the fuss was about...When I run into people that talk about this book, and how much they enjoyed it, I feel a burst of superiority, a sort of self-righteous pride, and I secretly hold it against them for their high opinions. I don't like feeling that way--but this is one of those books that is beyond awful."
5,best book I've read in 2006,"This book is one of those book that you remember for while and can imagine yourself to live in the story line.I will tell u know that you would love these book if you :1. Love traveling and adventure2. Know or experienced Spirituality and practice of Yoga and Meditation3. Experienced pain of love and hardship of renewing your lifeI especially loved the section about Italy and Indonesia and the fact that the book is a real journey of a lady to self discovery .Eat,Pray,Love is one of the best book I've read after the Kite Runner and Da Vinci Code"
1,This book was horrific!!,"I could not even get through the first chapter. I found it extremely difficult to empathize with the author. ""oh poor me getting divorced, I think I'll travel around the world. boo-hoo"". When I got divorced I did not get to travel around the world, I got to move in with my Mother! So, sorry Liz, sorry that I contributed to your bank account by buying this piece of trash. Clearly, everyone has their own opinion, for some reason people like this book. In my opinion, it is a complete waste of money. If you must read it, borrow it from your library first, but you might want to save yourself and read something more worthwhile, like your coffeemaker user's manual. Much better reading!"
1,I would give it no stars,SHALLOW! I can not believe this is a best seller. It makes me sad to think so many people find this book good.
2,Inspiring but needs editing,"I am motivated to pursue writing from my experience after reading this. While amusing, inspiring and enlivening I feel it could have been best told at half its paper space.Written by a young and ambitious writer the book has had major impact on many young women, we are living in a golden age of stream of consciousness publishing based on the ability to put pen to paper.Let this book be a lesson to all: if you feel you can do it, you can; the success of this book proves this however, there is a far longer and higher road to Greatness."
5,Amazing Book,"This book was amazing. I have read many reviews that say the Liz Gilbert came off as selfish. I would have to disagree. This book is about Liz finding herself and I appreciated that the novel focused solely on her. I found this book motivational and inspiring. There are tons of greats ""food for thought"" moments as well as quotes that were really meaningful. A+ book."
1,Slow,"I am an avid reader so I joined a book club. This book was on the list so, I bought it. I have had a hard time getting into it even though, I too, after my divorce went with a friend to Italy. It is probably just not my type of book, very slow, really boring."
2,Boring,I can't figure out what people got out of this book. The author should have made it a short story of Italy. It was boring.
3,Tedious but well written,"This author is clearly talented and I enjoyed the beginning of the book but like other reviewers found it became way too tedious. I read over 200 pages but then simply could not bring myself to finish. I got tired of the constant whining. And yes for somebody seeking enlightenment, the self obsession is hard to take. After a hundred pages or so, it becomes very repetitive. My girlfriend wanted to borrow it when I got done. I'm afraid I'll have to tell her not to bother with this one"
2,A whine,It was very hard to like the author. It felt like a long whine. I put the book down after the third chapter. For those of us that aren't globetrotters yet there are better books to read.
2,Hoped for More...,"After seeing this book do so well, I had to read it! However, while reading it, I found myself wondering what all the fuss was about. While I found Gilbert to be incredibly talented with metaphors and insightful at times, she displayed an air of superiority that got under my skin and kept me from fully enjoying her story."
4,"Eat, Pray, Love","Basically entertaining and spiritually helpful.A good read, but a bit slow in the beginning, then picked up halfway through the first segment.What could have been a very boring story is rescued by Gilbert's amusing way of looking at life.I recommend this book to those with open hearts and a willingness to go on this personal journey with the author. Let her story unfold and bring into your own life the discovery of a fresh way of being."
5,Great Book & Great condition!,This was an amazing book and it was in great condition when i recieved it! Fast shipping!!!
4,Eat Pray Love,Just started reading it. Easy to read author with a sense of humor.Am sure I will enjoy it thoroughly!
5,fantastic!,The movie's good the book is better. Great read. Uplifting and honest. Makes me wish I could travel more! :)
3,Not for evangelicals,"I'm a conservative Christian, but pretty open-minded so I was intrigued by the spiritual possibilities of this book. Elizabeth Gilbert asks all the right questions, but, unfortunately, finds all the wrong answers."
4,"Eat,Pray,Love","Well written! I could feel the author's pain, frustration,loneliness, and other emotions, in her search for ""being."""
1,OPRAH WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?,This is a self absorbed and selfish woman who came up with a cleaver title and is laughing all the way to the bank.
2,I Felt Sorry For the Improved Her,"the first dozen pages were brilliant. 90% of the books is lousy writing and a miserable read.she could be likeable but seems cold-hearted: for example: she doesn't feel sorrow over the two orphans in wayan's shop whom wayan seems to have taken in simply to work as free cooks and housekeepers for her and her shop. the author mentions that wayan doesn't include these poor 'orphans' in the new house purchase and the author doesn't really mind. i bet those 2 poor, abused homeless children are not in wayan's house now (there is a small chance she kept them on as servants after the book was published and widely read). that is just the type of thing the author is unintelligent and insensitive about.she is an oaf. an emotionally rough yet weak person. she obsesses on a random person and gloms onto that person 24/7 to an embarassing extent."
2,Whining,"Okay this book is just a four country whine fest. Elizabeth Gilbert whines about not wanting to have children in America, eating too much food in Italy, not being able to meditate in India and the heat in Bali...give me a break.There were moments when this book was not a tedious bookclub task book to read...some of the characters seemed a bit exaggerated but that did make parts of this book palatable."
5,This book has changed me.,"I don't want to say too much about this book, because that would spoil it, not only for others, but for myself as well. This book was amazing. I could relate to Liz's journey, her pain, her sorrow, and all the rest of it that she shares with us. I feel like she is a friend almost, her story is so intimate and personal. I particularly was sucked into the ""pray"" part of the book, which takes place in an ashram in India. I thought her writing to be very informative and involving. I felt as though I was there myself, with her, because that is how she tells her story.Her story gave me strength and reassurance that I am not alone in this world, that I am not alone in my life but share it with God and many others (my four brothers) which makes me so happy inside. I have felt many of the things that she said, but didn't know why. She makes me understand many things, most importantly the magnitude of God and his love. Thanks Liz, for that..."
5,"Eat, Pray, Love. And Read This Book","Even if you end up disagreeing with this author's approach and/or conclusions, read this book for its delightful play with words and word pictures. But, you'll likely come to appreciate Ms. Gilbert's journey--physical and spiritual, all the while laughing out loud, and will be provoked to think hard about your own."
2,FUNNY BUT NOT ENOUGH!,I thought the writing was entertaining and very genuine but not mature enough. I couldn't wait to finish the book .... I had to scan through the last few pages.
1,boo hoo,"I found this book to be whiny and self-absorbed. I honestly couldn't get past the first 20 pages, skimmed thru a lot of the rest and felt like it's a 300 page version of a lame women's magazine article. Oh boo hoo, you have 2 homes, money,travel around the world. Poor you, to have so many hot men interested in you that you have to declare celibacy- what about those of us who are celibate because we don't have hot men chasing us? Who have to work for a living and can't afford to go on soul-searching vacations? I just couldn't relate to the author. Lots of people get divorced and have a hard time of it, what makes her so special?...this book isn't worth your time or money!"
5,I love the voice,"Some other reviewers did not like the writer's voice in this book, calling her narcissistic and saying there was no meaning. I had the opposite reaction. I loved the complete candor, the humor, the struggle, the journey, the wonderment, the voice. I found the whole journey to be inspiring and I felt like a girlfriend in on a tale told by a good friend. To me it's an example of the unfolding that happens when someone allows themselves to be themselves and follow their inner voice. That's biggest lesson here. Bravo. I also took away something from reading about the author's meditation practice. She spoke to her mind like a little child, telling it to be still while she listened to God. One of many examples of how a creative person finds their way to peace. I'll probably read this one again sometime."
1,"indulgent, spoiled rotten, selfish, vapid, narcissistic-EMPTY","It is a good text for all that is wrong about our culture today...vapid, narcissistic, over-indulgent & spoiled.The author is incredibly self-serving & shallow and gives Americans a bad name. Her thinly disguised bragging about literally everything is very annoying.Navel-gazing at its most bothersome."
2,"so what, really?","big deal, a well-paid journalist from new york city gets a divorce and then gets a paycheck to go rent some houses, hang out in Italy and do yoga in Asia for a little while. WHOOP-DE-DOO!sorry, i just don't see much heroic or adventurous in her endeavor, really, having traveled around the world for years on my own grit and survival skills - not a recurring paycheck from a huge magazine! it just kind of gets my goat that so many people find this story inspiring somehow... there are thousands upon thousands of far more inspirational people out there.the writer, however, is sometimes funny and entertaining - as she should be, as a paid professional. it's a cute read, but in all seriousness, how this book got so popular is beyond me - must have been an AWESOME publicist!"
1,I wish there were an option for 0 stars,"Don't even waste your time. I can count on one hand the number of books that disgusted me so much I couldn't finish them and this was one of them. The whining is unreal for someone with no real responsibility in life. The author is very melodramtic. This woman needs real problems and has WAY too much time on her hands. I really wanted to slap the selfishness out of her. Awful, awful book."
2,Seems never ending,"The author rambled on and on...I found myself skipping paragraphs just to get to the ""point"". Don't waist your money. NOT ENGAGING, at ALL!"
1,Ugh -- self absorbed writer travels globe...yay,"I'd read a good deal of these reviews before reading the book and still read it anyway. What a waste of time. It's not that the author is simply self-absorbed it's that she's self-absorbed and at the same time an incredibly self unaware person -- her repeated surprise at finding out that she's a control freak or that she's got ""issues"" about her serial monogamy are a surprise to only herself. Eat is tolerable and Love is an interesting review of Bali but Pray is just a beat down. If ""Richard from Texas"" writes a book I'd be interested in what he has to say about the ashram but this book is over-hyped and under delivers."
2,Struggling to get through the book,So I got this book because of the movie. I struggled to read it. The author goes into tooooo much detail about things and it just drags on. She also writes the book for higher level readers which turns me off since there is toooo much detail
4,"Eat Pray Love - lighthearted, witty and entertaining","According to the reviews on this site, people seem to love or hate Elizabeth Gilbert's Eat Pray Love. The story follows the author's quest to put herself back together again after an early mid-life crisis, a quest that takes her to Italy in search of pleasure (the culinary type, not the romance novel type), to India in search of spirituality, and to Bali in search of a way to balance the two. As many reviews complain, Gilbert is no hero - she can be seflish and whiny. But I don't think that stops the book from being a joy to read. Gilbert's writing is laugh out loud witty, and her adventures (after the drama of her divorce) make for a light, entertaining beach read. I say accept this book for what it is (not a travel guide, nor a spiritual guide), and you will probably be pleased."
1,so romance novelish!,"I too could not stomach finishing this book. The maudlin style reminded me of a similar over-rated piece ""The Bridges of Madison County"". If that was your thing, go ahead...It is not mine! A ridiculous ""romp"" through foreign countries with a ""money is no object"" theme. ""Oh,which man shall choose?"" The book 'Tales of Female Nomad' by Rita Gelman is a much better written book with a realistic eye about money and romance. I so do not recommmend this book unless you are a shallow, insecure person."
1,Boring and Unlikely,"I hate to say something bad about someone else's life/experience. However, since she has put it out there, it is fair to be critical. There were a few sections which held my attention, but over all it was a boring and unlikely tale."
2,"Eat, Snore, Snooze",I just had to read this book that received so much attention andis now a movie. Took me a lot longer than usual to read asparts were dull and the author was such a whiner. I have read of cancer patients who didn't cry on the bathroom floor even as they faced horrible pain and agony from chemotherapy. Sorry I spent themoney.
3,"Eat, Pray, Love","The book was good, but, to me it didn't live up to all the hype it got. I enjoyed the Italy and Bali parts, while the India part started to get bogged down. I do want to see the movie because Julia seems like the perfect person to play Liz."
1,Terrible,This is a terrible book. If you are self-centered you will love this book. If you don't take commitment seriously you will love this book. If you think you can be your own God you will love this book.
1,Not worth the hype,"I wanted to like this book. Everyone I knew loved it and said I had to read this book. I didn't make it past Italy. I was disappointed that she was paid to take this trip (book advance) and wondered how much of it was manufactured for the book. Also, to me, her tone seemed haughty and self-important."
2,title is better than content,"With all the hype, I was disappointed with the book. All women struggle with identity, and this just seemed a little whiny to me. It was not the best book I read this summer."
4,BEAUTIFULLY ENTERTAINING,"I loved taking the journey across the globe on her quest to find a deeper and truer ""self"". Don't we all struggle with so many of the same aspects in life? The book is well written and while I have not yet seen the movie, I am sure it will also be good, starring Julia Roberts.I also just finished reading ""Why NOT Me?"" - by Raymond Rodriguez-Torres. It is the real-life story of his little daughter's victory over cancer and how God provided a miracle for this family. My faith has been taken to NEW heights!! Read it today!"
2,Holy Cow,"I'll admit I did not get a chance to read all of the posted reviews so I apologize in advance for any repetitions. This wasn't my favorite book by far, but I appreciate how hard it is to write ANYTHING so I don't want to knock it too bad, but I wanted to recommend another travel story about India. The book is called ""Holy Cow: an Indian adventure"" by Sarah Macdonald. Macdonald gives a unique account of her travels to this wonderful, but very un-western destination. I was blessed enough to visit India myself, and Holy Cow just felt truer, (although still way out there), to the experience of visiting India. Hope this helps!Holy Cow: An Indian Adventure"
3,Midlife - well sort of...,"This is somewhat of a good journey book... as some of us are on a journey... but though I did find some of the book interesting... there came a point where I wanted to Scream at the author to STOP being so ""Winey"" about things she should well have gotten over... this part - repeatedly brought up in the book made the journey a hard one to get through... other than that it was a good read... but I kept wanting to tell her...""Get over it already and move on!Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia"""
3,Meh,"This book was recommended to me by a close friend who said that it was the cure to her depression. I raced right through the Italy/eat section and was all set to agree with her, but then i got to India/pray and have been stuck on it for weeks. Maybe I should skip straight to the Indonesia/love part? To be fair, this review might say more about me than it says about this book."
5,Stil recommending,This is a book that I picked up shortly after it came out and I am still recommending it today. It was very easy to read... it was a journey that I believe we all take in our own way and it was a pleasure to read and reflect.
1,don't waste your time on this one,"Not one interesting character. Not even the author. A horrible divorce... big deal. A love of food ... not really worth 116 pages. I had to get to page 156 to finally understand. She is in an Ashram in India having trouble silencing her mind and meditating.""What I am alarmed to find in meditation is that my mind is actually not that interesting a place after all.""That sentence sums up the book"
1,Disastrous from beginning to end,"I beg of you, do not waste your valuable time on this book. The author's unparallelled self-absorbtion is entirely understandable in light of the fact that she was trying to work through a serious depression, but do you really want to spend your time listening to her analyze the minutiae of her daily life? B-O-R-I-N-G. There were only one or two insightful, interesting paragraphs in the whole book. I suffered my own existential crisis reading it because I could not understand how it became a best-seller - how could I be so out of touch with my fellow readers? Spare yourself this pain."
2,I really tried.............,"I really wanted to love this, but while reading it, I could not get past the fact that the author is 34 years old! She's slim and lovely! She's wealthy! She's on a ALL-EXPENSES PAID ""research"" vacation(oops, I mean sabbatical) to ITALY, INDIA and an island paradise! And she's whining, crying, pontificating about the meaning of her life, complaining... I mean it really was a struggle for me to get to the end. Oh, and my goodness, the end....the ""point"" of the book, the climax, oh I won't ruin it for you. I admit it, perhaps I am being ""age-ist"" here--- had the author been a 55 year old divorcee, perhaps a survivor of an illness or catastrophe, maybe I could have bought it.... but no, this was too much ""Carrie Bradshaw goes Under the Tuscan Sun"" for me... I'll take Frances Mayes anytime."
1,"A Better Name for This Book: ""Trite, Self-Serving, Psychobabble""","Sigh. It was brutal getting through this book. Never before have I been so disappointed by a book that so many of my female friends have raved about. This simplistic plot revolves around the narcissistic, yet supposedly ""buddhist-cleansed"" ego of Liz Gilbert. At one point she ""becomes one with God"". Need I say more? Lame. She throws in cheaps shots against everything from Republicans to Vipassana meditation under the guise of her smug, know-it-all attitude. I didn't need to hear why her first marriage failed; the more I got to know this annoyingly ""deep"" person, it was too obvious.Bottom line: I would rather sit down and read ""Buddhism for Dummies"" 100 times than have to try to get thru my copy of Eat, Pray, Love again."
3,Interesting Read,"This book was definitely an interesting read. I learned a lot about culture, language, and world spirituality. Elizabeth Gilbert is an open-minded writer who does a great job portraying the world through her eyes. My only qualm about the book is that for such an educated person, she uses WAY to much vulgar language. I probably would not recommend this book to a friend simply because of the frequent use of the ""F"" word. It was extremely offensive to me and was not at all needed to illustrate her point. If not for this, the book would probably be one of my top ten reads."
4,Great book with lots of meaning,"I LOVED this book. I will admit that it was really slow getting starting and getting into good parts. I mean, it seemed like it took months to get to the meat but when it did, I was not disappointed. There were so many lines and little tidbits of knowledge about self, spirituality and embracing life that I learned. I found myself highlighting certain lines throughout the book. The biggest lesson I learned took away at the end was to embrace life; even if it makes you or other uncomfortable. Sometimes we have to be uncomfortable to learn to appreciate comfortable. That goes for all aspects of your life. When I finally saw the movie, I felt the passion of the book. There were some scenes cut out of it due to the length but it was totally worth it. REad the book and then see the movie."
3,Eat Pray Love (and Pray some more),"I was disappointed in this book. I waited months to buy it, ""do I want to read it? Do I not?"" Now, I say ""not."" Couldn't believe the gluttonous behavior in Italy. Nor the extreme Ashram thing (God can be found anywhere and He doesn't require that you sit without moving for 10 hours.) Ridiculous that people pursue these practices and these scam artists who provide these non-Christian practices. A dumb, dumb, dumb waste of time. Go out and volunteer at a homeless shelter or a place for abused women. You'll find God much faster and do more good. I could have done without the almost explicit sex with the Brazilian dude. This book spoiled my wish to see the movie. I don't really care now."
2,"Self indulgent, whiney, It didn't enlighten me. . .","I felt like this woman was so self indulgent and whiney. Why oh why did she have to tell everyone about her very important boring life? I tried to like this. ..I really did. I just couldn't relate. I kept thinking I'd eventually start liking her as she started travelling or something, but I couldn't. She just kept annoying me and I kept rolling my eyes. Maybe I've seen tragedy and her life just isn't it. Yes, pain is pain, but I wish she had some sense to be more thankful for what she had rather than having to search far and wide. . . .I guess it's memorable because I read it months ago and just the thought of that woman still makes me grit my teeth. However, I know many woman that just loved this book. . . . ."
1,GLORIFIES NARCISSISM,"I thought narcissism like this was widely recognized as a character disorder. I like David Denby's comment in The New Yorker: ""We may get the impression that the world in its glory exists principally to satisfy her complicated needs."" Why is this book so popular? Are the women who like this book as self-centered and self-indulgent as the creepy, self-centered author? This woman and this book are digusting."
1,Big disappointment,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, which had been highly recommended to me by several people. What I picked up was one of those reads that starts interesting and slowly falls into the world of WTF in a few short chapters.The story totally comes across as though it's written from a teenage girl's point of view. I don't mean it's juvenile read; rather it's hyper self-aware much in the same way teenaged girls seem to feel like they are on a stage in the center of the universe. Instead of reading a memoir of someone going through self-awareness, I felt like I was reading a caricature of a movie about a teenager writing her future memoir about going through self-awareness.I wish I'd skipped the book entirely and gone straight to the movie. At this point, I have no interest in watching the film because the books are usually better."
2,self absorbed,"I may have enjoyed reading this book, but listening to Elizabeth Gilbert drone on about herself was really annoying. I liked the last part best - the part about Bali, because she started talking about other people more and less about herself."
5,"Eat,Pray,Love","This book is wonderfully written! Lots of humor, and easy to relate to. The descriptions of her experiences in the ashram was wonderful. If anyone wants to know why people become interested in Yoga and Meditation, they only have to read this! 5 Stars!!"
1,Unreadable it's so bad,I have never encountered such an astonishingly self-cenetered creature in print before. I was embarrassed for her and for myself during the entire first chapter that anyone would see her mission in life as cutesy commentary on everything in the universe. She really thinks she has discovered Italy and she is very smug about how she is the only one who can adequately describe it. Egocentric? This person shacked up with her lover and destroyed her marriage and and comes out the victim and has to travel all over the world to reward herself - and on and on and on and on. PLEASE save yourself the money and take my book FOR FREE! Just pay the postage.
5,Just What I Needed,"After going through some rough breakups and hard times of my own, this book was exactly what I needed to regain my self-confidence and get me back on my feet again. Very thought provoking and entertaining all at the same time."
2,Not my cup of tea...,"Overall I was disappointed in Eat Pray Love, I had heard so much about it before I read it. I wanted to love it and I tried hard to relate to Elizabeth (the author) but I just didn't. I don't know if my expectations of the book were too high before I started reading it, but I wanted to fall in love with this book and for it to be one of those books that I just could not put down. Instead, I found myself struggling to finish it."
3,Enjoyable Read,"Just finished this book: ""Eat, Pray, Love"". I had a hard time putting the book down. It was most enjoyable to read of her adventures throughout the three countries she visited. Her travel back from her severe depression due to her failed marriage was painful to read. The severe depression had a vice-like grip on her emotions and continues throughtout the book almost like another character in the book. The other characters she meets throughout her travels are interesting and enjoyable. It is not a piece of literary genius."
3,Attacks on Republicans,Here I am reading and enjoying the first part of the book and suddenly there is an attack on Republicans. I do not appreciate this political attack. Republicans read and enjoy books also. This gratuitous attack certainly lowered my respect for the author and made the rest of the book suspect.
2,Rom Com Quality Book,"I just didn't care for this book. After reading it, I feel just like I've watched one of those solidly mediocre romantic comedies (after seeing about a million glossy promos): I'm disappointed in myself for falling for the hype, & irritated at having spent the time & money.Liz seems fun & funny--I can see why she makes so many friends throughout the course of her story--but I simply was not interested enough in her life or her journey to spend so much time with it, & didn't find her narrative voice compelling. I suspect the book only really resonates with people who can relate to her personal situation, which is too bad, since its premises (heartbreak, eating, connecting with God & others, finding love) hold universal appeal. I'll bet an excellent editor could have brought that out.As it stands, I wouldn't recommend EPL to anyone who is not recovering from divorce and/or deeply interested in eastern religion. Unless they enjoy rom com quality books."
