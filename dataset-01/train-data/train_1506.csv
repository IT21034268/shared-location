3,Deep stuff...,"D-Cru, man, they tight..they know whats goin on in life, they know what us men out here feel bout all dem girls..those special ones..my fav song on da Track is ""i will be waiting"" its a good song check it out...hit it up..out"
3,Lots of big picture advice but lacks details of how and why,"If you want lots of general advice, buy this book. If you want details of how and why to implement ""Software Process Improvement"" then do not waste your time and money on this book. Humphrey and McConnell both are much better at supplying details of how and why."
5,Cd of the year!,"This cd is the best I've bought in sometime and I listen to every music type.PJ is at her best,she prevails on the best cut on the cd which is titled,""A Place Called Home"". It's the third track for those of u,who are used to track numbers oppossed to titles.She writes,mixes,produces,plays lead and rhythm guitars,keys and all vocals,that kind of various talent is unheard of in todays music market. Her ingenuity is so refreshing.Buy this cd and run to the store,don't walk,it will be in your car cd changer or your walkman for months to come,trust me,it's that good.Other tracks to listen to are,""We Float"",""You Said Something"" and ""Big Exit""!"
2,Game Over,I must admit this guy can have some good Flows but the beats scream independent the beats are good but they do not blend togeather.It looks like the only good one of here is the single Game over wich is pretty tight Lyrically this is alrightLyrics 7/10 Production 5/10 X Factor 5/10 Classic 6/10 Me 6/10Overall-24/50 gets low points because of production 2 Mics
3,LIL Flip U Gotta Feel Me,"I think its an okay cd although i mostly bought it for the song Game Over[Flip] but i recommend u listen to ""The Ghetto"",""Sun Dont Shine"" and ""Sunshine"""
1,REALLY A ZERO,"Yo just cuz ya man is representin' don't mean he's dope! Flip is ass god, how the fnck did this nucca get crowned freestyle kings, betta yet how the fnck did he get in the game? His voice is annoying, he sounds like some shorty that learned how to rap. If I was from Houston I'd be embarassed.I guess he'll go platinum cuz girls think hes cute- (I'm not hatin' hes definitety gettin' his money, and he never looks bummy) but I'd rather listen to Ying Yang Twins then this fool.He sounds like he never finished middle school, I mean he makes Noreaga look like Rakim. Yo just cuz u really from the hood and u got street credentials don't mean u should rap. FLIP, PUT THAT MIC DOWN!"
1,wack cd,aint feelin it at all!!!!! mainly becuz his wack flow and wack lyrics...... he cant rap AT ALLanyone can rap like him
3,Where did the real Flip go?,"This album was a big let down to me. I loved the Undaground Legend LP because it had that underground Texas style. This CD sounds way too commercialized for Flip. Also, instead of having mostly southern rappers featured on this one he has people like Cam'ron and Dipset, who nobody cares about down south. He also sounds a lot less creative on this album. There's too much filler and the songs have no real meaning, unlike the last album. I thought I remember Flip saying no matter how rich he got he would never change. I guess he lied."
2,Average at best,"When i heard that Lil Flip put out a new album, I got excited. When I got the album I was not impressed at all. He has to step his game up lyrically. He's gonna go platinum because of 'Game Over', but once the word spreads about how average the album is the sales will slow down. Step Ya Game Up Flip!"
2,Weak,"Please don't waste your money on this crap!!! Don't be fooled by 'game over.' Flip lyrically slacks on just about all the rest the cd. I only gave it 2 stars because with so few lyricists from the south Flip brings something to the table (come on we're dying down here) but 'king of the south?' don't make me laugh. The guest appearences like Cam'ron, Three 6 mafia and even Jim 'sorry' Jones are well welcome because Flip can't hold his own for one cd, forbid sitting through two and his baby voice gets annoying kinda annoying. Production also isn't to hot. Basically the cd is pretty weak. But if your looking for good rappers from the south try Scarface, T.I. Ludacris or UGK (in that order) and Young Buck, Slim Thug, and Stat Quo are shaping up nicely."
3,great single but okay cd,"this Cd didn't impress as some of his other work. a great single gmae over, but the cd itself is only okay. i would get teh Cd if you are lil' flip fan, but you might have to listen to some of his early work to actually enjoy this CD. but i still like the CD."
1,Lil Flip-Typical Kindergarden Rap,"This album didnt bring about any high expectations,it is a typical lil flip album.Nothing interesting is being said,nothing mindblowing or usefull 2 our young generation.Just the typical references 2 drugs,alcohol,women,parties,and violence that you get with just about every album these days.I dont know how many Columbia Record representatives are on here voting this album 5 stars,but it is far from a five star album.This album is not necessary bad,its just heard it all before material,he's bringing nothing new 2 the table.Its sounds just like his last album only a updated version.How many times can you talk about the same things on each track,it just gets old."
3,Not bad,"Why get all wordy, I'm basically going to tell the audience what is good and bad on this particular album. First OFF Flip's last cd was very good so this album was a somewhat dissapointment to me. A plus would be the hot beats. However flip you need to step the game up with some more intuitive lyrics, that means don't just rap around your gold chain's and hoe's and representing. I like the tracks: Game over, them boyz, bounce, represent (banner keeping it hot), my name. Like I said the rest of the songs are mediocre. Not a BAD effort, but Lil' Flip dissapointed me this time."
2,For lil Flip it is game over. Because cd sucks.,For lil Flip it is game over. Because cd sucks. One good songs out of two discs. That is bad. 2 out of 5
3,Sunshine,Can anyone please tell me if this cd has the video version of Sunshine featuring Lea?Thanks for the help
4,stop hatin haters,"Come on everybody. This cd isn't bad as everybody say it is. You just gotta give flip a chance. The cd is actually better than what i thought it would be. The first cd is the best one. I can ride it all the way through. The second cd is not better than the first one but it is worth listening to. So all u haters, keep hating and lil flip still gon continue to make fire music."
3,wheres lil flip?,"Where is lil Flip? I can't find him on his own CD. This CD is ok if you like Master P, kings of krunk and so on. lil flip has lost his old underground sound and has went on to better things....like money? now don't get me wrong this is cd is ok but I love his old cd. Now it comes with 2 cds, is that needed?they are both so short!!"
1,U GOTTA FLIP YA ASS BACK TO THE TRASH,"Man Lil Flip is one wack ass rapper man. I gotta admit, Undaground Legend was listenable but this CD was a joke. Only 2 good songs, Game Over and Sunshine and they are the singles.Most of these beats are trash, his flow is a laugh, his delivery isnt the same, he sounds like he got his rhymes from a nursery book, he needs to flip his lil bish ass back to the underground.Only people giving this album 3+ are people from Houston, dikridaz, music ignorants, or children."
2,Worst album I have purchased this year.,"If your trim this album down to one disc with about 10 songs you MIGHT have a decent album here. The only good songs are the collabo with P Troy the one with Luda and his DTP boys and game over, the rest of this album has wack beats and even worse lyrics. The udnerground king should have reamined underground."
1,Lil Flip isn't real rap,"Ok, for all of the MTV heads listen up. This is not real hip hop, sorry to burst your bubble. This is garbage put together solely to get people that follow the crowd to purchase this cd. Lil Flip may be regarded as an underground legend but with his commercial releases I am not impressed whatsoever. Real hip hop is an art form like: De La Soul, Tribe Called Quest, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, Rakim, Common, 2pac, Biggie, Nas, KRS. There are many that fit into the category of real hip hop, but this is not. Flip is popular only because MTV plays it all day, if you listen to his rhymes compared to a Kweli or Eminem he doesnt come close. Show yourself some respect and explore hip hop for what it is and not what MTV wants you to think it is. Lil Flip put the mic down and go work at McDonalds cuz thats about the only thing you're good for."
1,Wack,"When he did that song ""Game Over"", I thought I'd give him a chance. I heard him on the radio with K-tone and thought he was acting like he was really raw when he's not, but after this song, I was like...okay, maybe. But he did this song with Sunshine that I saw five minutes ago and he was bragging about how he did his rhyme in 10 minutes and how other rappers are slow if they do theirs in 30 minutes...but the rhyme was so wack. He basically talked about how he gets numbers, he has money, he got bling...blahzay blah. The way he was bragging on doing this rhyme in 10 minutes, I'm thinking...wow! This is gonna be raw. It sounded like he did it in 10 minutes. Seriously, I wouldn't want this cd if it was free."
3,U GOTTA TRASH ME,MANE THIS ALBUM IS A THROWBACK!!! THROWBACK ON THE SALES RACK BECAUSE THIS IS A CASH MONEY/ DIAMONDS AND GOLDS AND HOES AND REPRESENTING ALBUM. I DID NOT GIVE HIM 1 STAR BECAUSE I USED TO DIG LIL FLIP BUT NOW..... I LIKE ONLY ABOUT 3 SONGS OFF OF THIS JOINT BUT I LIKE THAT SONG REPRESENT WIT 3-6 MAFIA BECAUSE DEM MY BOYZ AND LIL FLIP WAS RIGHT THE GAME IS OVER. (FOR HIM). GO GET THE LIVING LEGENDS EVEN USHER NOT THIS DOWNLOAD HIS MUSIC SPEND YO MONEY ON A HAMBURGER OR SOMETHING. IM OUT . FREE PROJECT PAT
3,I NEED MINE $$,"I REALLY HERE TO WRITE ABOUT LIL'FLIPS I NEED MINE $$ ALBUM (2005).

3,diappointed,I used to be Flip's big fan.Underground legend was his best but he's gone wack more and more. its his most selling album ever but he got worse and also his next album 'I need mine' is worse than 'u gotta feel me.' he's been lost his own.why did he work with wack producer manny fresh(album'I need mind')? its self- destruction.so so diappointed
5,The Best CD Ever?,"After hearing the smash hit ""game over"" on the radio a few times, I was eager to get a hold of the new Lil' Flip cd. I have his underground legend cd and it was pretty impressive, but he really went over the top with ""u gotta feel me."" In my opinion, this one goes down as one of the best ever.First of all, ""game over"" is such an outstanding song that the 15 dollars were worth it just to play that song over and over. The two disk set is packed full of bangin' songs all of which have quality lil' flip lyricism combined with ever better production. ""All I Know"" featuring Camron is a nice song as well as ""bounce"" and ""throw yo hood up."" I think that out of the 21 songs, 19 or 20 out of them are completely awesome. I recommend this cd everybody who is a fan of good rap. Keep it real and keep it real with the lord."
3,Where happened?,"This album is aight, but what dun happened to Flip? I was feelin' Leprechaun and Underground Legend, but it's like his whole style has changed. I think he changed his style for Sony. I like Game Over though. I think that if you didn't know who Flip was and you listened to U.L and then Game Over, you would think it was two different people. I hope Flip is successful with his new album, but I miss his old style and will be bumpin his first 2 CD's."
2,Trash,"The only 2 songs worth listening to are ""Sunshine"" & ""Game Over"" the rest of the album isnt worth listening to. He has a lot of talented rapper's on the album but the beats are horrible. Dont even bother listening to the 2nd disc in the album. Flip did exactly the same on this album as he did with ""Undergroung Legend"" make one good song and the rest of the album sucks.Lyrics -- B-Beats -- DOveral - C-"
1,stop the lies i wish we could give zero stars,"Ima talk to flip on this one. who in the world told u u were the king of the south. that person should be shot in the hand and the foot cuz ya terrible. u are triddash and u are slowly killin rap. its people like u that make it so that im backed into the corner wit a handfull of real rap (resonable doubt, stillmatic) u gotta pointelss beef wit T.I. goin on he is BETTER THAN U DUN. ur corny wack trash and everything negative. T.I. is givin u the business. luda was the king of the south before he relinquished the title to T.I. stop makin music u got enuff bread to quit dun make liquor or whateva AND YA CREW IS TRASH 2"
5,lil flip with tight beats,lil flip is tight on this album best so far i think he came back with really tight beats he could rap good so go cop this 2 disc before is &quot;GAMEOVER&quot;.
3,Man i am not happy with this album,"Ok where can i start i hate to compare albums .But this album is no where near as good as undergroung legend. I like flips style alot just sounds like he is trying to go more pop on this album..more mainstream. Its a few bangers on the album just isnt what i thought it would be. Check it out ,but if ya aint heard underground legend thats the album ya need to get before you can even listen to this album. To many apperances not enough TEXAS STYLE ON HURR......."
1,Honest Lil Flip fan,I was bumpin Lil Flip before the underground legend CD but this CD here U gotta feel me is pretty terrible. I been waitin for his next major release since the Underground Legend album but i must say this is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT all but two tracks are weak and the lyrical content sounds like a sony executive wrote it but im still a fan but i can longer allow these untruthful reviews to go unaddressed.
3,Don't waste your money!,"OK, this is the first Lil Flip album that I've bought and I must say that I feel like I wasted my money. I first heard Lil Flip when he came out with ""I Can Do That"" a few years ago and that song was hot. When I heard ""Game Over"" I decided that I should buy his album. His lyrics sounded real and he claimed that he had that ""Biggie ready to die s***."" It turns out that U Gotta Feel Me is nowhere near Ready to Die. All of Flip's beats are weak and his lyrics are even weaker. He claims that hip hop needs a make over but he sure isn't gonna be the one to provide it. If you want a good southern rap CD, I recommend you go buy T.I.'s Trap Muzik instead."
2,lil flip is my favorite rapper but this is the worst cd he put out,man what n da hell was wrong with him when he put this out kum on flip
2,What the HELL?,"Man, what the hell happened to Lil' Flip? I used to be a big fan until i picked up this CD? Things really went wrong here the whole album really sucks expect for the 2 songs game over and sunshine. Well whatever the reason i still enjoy Lil' Flip but he needs to do a better job with his music and production cause he's gonna make Texas look bad. He has been an underground legend here in texas but now he just sounds too mainstream and commercial ever since we went major? Well whatever the deal is i hope his next album is better than this, If you didnt like this album then i prefer picking up ""Underground Legend"" and ""The Leprechaun"" now those are two REALLY good albums by Lil flip. Want to hear even better TEXAS music? Pick up Chamillionaire's ""Mixtape Messiah"", ""Sound of Revenge"" or ""Man on Fire"" those are really good albums now that is a Texas all star coming up."
2,flipped on his head!!!,"i don't know what the world did to lil flip for him to put music listeners through this much pain with his sh**. what is worse, he gave us a double disc. :( thank god my friend lent it to me to listen. his flow is horrible and his rhymes are maddd weak. he has nothing much to say other than praising himself because quite frankly, nobody else will. i mean come on...i'm ah treat you like milk, i'll do nothing but spoil you. trust me flip, don't go battling with T.I. beacuse not even your lucky clover could prevent him from destroying you...trap muzik style. so ppl, plz don't buy this mess.one!"
1,Completely Worthless,"This CD is complete garbage. The beats are almost exclusively sampled from better songs, the lyrics suck (shooting guns in the hood ad infinitum), and it's pitched as a double album but is the same length as a single CD (shorter if you consider D12 World at 79 minutes). There is absolutely nothing new or worthwhile in this album. The single, Game Over, is mediocre at best, although many think it is appealing. Obviously, it was meant as the ""3 minute hook"", which would make people buy the album, the rest of which is all filler material. The worst song, though, has to be The Ghetto. It takes a sample from the classic song Is It Because I'm Black (by Syl Johnson)...and butchers it completely. You have to listen to it to understand, but believe me, it should be a crime. Buy D12 World or College Dropout (Kanye West) instead."
5,A great book!,"I hated for this book to end. I truely felt alone when I reached the last page; the characters had become etched into my conscious much like that of a long time friend. For the two weeks I read this book, I realy felt like I was experiencing life as it must have been in the SouthWest around 1850. The section on prospecting for gold in 1848 California was brilliantly done...gritty, real, adventurous and insightful. I get the feeling Mr. Blum did a tremendous amount of research before writing this book - the details are incredibly precise yet colorful and dramatic. Now that I've finished the book and suffer from character withdrawl; I only hope that Mr. Blum sends another gift from his imagination our way...soon!"
5,A Western with Depth.,"River of Souls transports the reader into the real southwest and uses this as a backdrop for exploring coming of age issues in a turbulent time. None of the western stereotypes exist, so when the reader connects with tangential facts and events, it seems all the more real and satisfying. The historical reality combined with the interpersonal intensity of the characters make this a surprisingly enjoyable read."
5,River of Souls,"`The River of Souls' is an exciting story in an exciting time in the history of the Southwest. Blum has done research after research, until his colorful cast of characters rush to overtake the history of their times. The villian looms in the bachground, threatening to undo the plots and plans of these early adventurers. Ivon Blum has woven an intensly readable story into a quest for gold, land and wild horses.Glen E. Root Journalist, Paso Robles, Ca"
3,Good book but.......,"As stated in other reviews, this is a pretty good book--good begining, good stuff on turnarounds, but then, pedal to the metal. No intermediate stuff at all. Also, it would have been nice if Dave had done slow versions of the various songs--he plays faster than I can listen!! He could be an excellent teacher if he'd just realize people need to walk before they can run. Start simple, go intermediate, then go for it."
5,WILSON PICKETT CD,HAVE A FEW OF HIS CD'S AND THEY ALL HAVE A VARIETY OF HIS MUSIC MAKING THIS ONE A GREAT ASSET FOR A CD COLLECTOR. GREAT SOUND. HAD TO BUST A MOVE WHEN THIS IS PLAYING.
5,Terminally Wicked,"I highly reccomend this cd to anyone who is interested in graduating beyond simply admiring the Man for the 3 or 4 or 5 classics which are recycled endlessly in movie soundtracks, etc.I forget whether this is one of the lps which Wilson recorded at the legendary Muscle Shoals Studios, but Bobby Womack's vibes, songwriting & guitar are apparent in abundance here and this is a true album collection with virtually no filler. Nicely recorded compared to his lps made a year or 2 earlier.It was easy to assign Midnight Mover 5 stars---it may be the best lp Pickett ever put together..."
2,Item suggests it is a foam cutter!,I bought this product because the title suggests it is a foam cutter when in fact it is merely a replacement part for a foam cutter. The tool itself is another $34 and what a simple tool for the price.I was looking for a cheap foam cutter and now I`m again looking for a cheap foam cutter..... FOAM CUTTER BOW AND GUIDE???? No just bow and guide.
4,good and condense,"The book is somewhat clear and condense version of numerical method: linear algebra.It seems that the book is quiet decent, but it is very difficult. Since I am not a numerical method guy, I found this book was very difficult to read if you don't have strong background of linear algebra and some basic numerical method knowledge. However, overall, the book was well-written and is good for ones who has good background of linear algebra. We used this book for CS class (I am not a CS student)...and it was okay."
5,Good reference,"I have been using this textbook for my Numerical Linear Algebra class, and it have been a great help, actually is a good complement to Numerical Linear Algebra by Lloyd N. Trefethen and David Bau III. I totally recommend it."
2,tool is okay but description lacks,the tool is a good one but it only works on square style faucets. it will not work on anything except outside water faucets.I need one to work on inside water faucwts as well as outside. There was no way to tell which style this was from the picyure or description.
1,"If this is Perfect, I'd hate to see their second best.","I expected that this would be a nice t-shirt considering the price and that it is ""mid-weight"". Unfortunately, it shrunk just as badly as the 4-pack Fruit of the Loom t-shirts that I've bought at Wal-Mart. It does seem to be a bit heavier than the FotL shirts, but ultimately that doesn't matter much when it is unwearable. I washed/dried it one time and the waist hem is nearly above my beltline.These shirts are 100% cotton, apparently not pre-shrunk, and tagless.Definitely not worth the price.If you buy this item, you may want to get a size or two bigger than your normal size. Even then, I wouldn't recommend them."
3,Tagless and careless,"There may be no tag, but the care instructions are now ineligible to be read. Kinda stinks. Cold water wash?? Warm water wash? Help me out here. :("
1,Hanes Perfect Rag...,"horrible T, after you wash and dry it.Cotton is soft...but shrinks horribly Awkward. Shrunk big time in the length but sleeves stayed big. My Kirkland (made by Hanes Tees) are way better and shrunk like expected. Don't buy these and don't trust the fit from the picture on the package. Thanks for the new cleaning rags. Rip-off"
2,Mechanical Problems,"The blender arrived without having been completely repaired. After about 10 seconds of blending, it began to smell like burning rubber. Clearly the factory did not completely recondition the unit."
4,Satisfied Customer,The blender is sturdy and I like the fact that it has a wide opening. I used it the day it arrived and it works just fine. Great deal.
2,Smells like burning rubber,"I bought this product because of the price ($28.00) and being a stainless steel blender I thought I was getting a super deal. I received the blender and I started using it right away, it was nice and sturdy, it looked good on my kitchen counter but once I turned it on, I got this smell, like burning rubber and I hated it. Too good to be true, I guess it did not pass thru the quality control department even though it does says is ""refurbished"". Do not buy it unless you want it just for good looks."
2,Never again,"I got this drill for Christmas 2000, so I have owned it approximately 1 1/2 years. I have built one set of lower kitchen cabinets and set up forms to pour a garage floor and have primarily used it to drive screws. For the past year it has been trying to quit. Approximately 1 year ago it wouldn't go in reverse. Then it magically repaired itself and worked fine. About six months ago it wouldn't go into high speed. Again it straightened up and worked again and today I took it out to drive some screws and the thing was dead. And the batteries were fully charged. I had to break out the Bosch 18 volt. For a contractor grade tool it isn't as good as it should be. I am disappointed in the quality for a fairly expensive drill. I doubt that I will buy Makita again. Milwaukee or Bosch for me."
4,Follow-on to previous rating,"I still like this drill. My previous rating emphasized too much that a bad repair place ruined one of my two Makita 18v drills. However, the drill itself is excellent. It is well made, and will take just about any drilling job thrown at it. After the disastrous repair (to install a new trigger switch), I took apart the drill and found metal gears and ball bearings, metal thrust bearings, and overall quality construction. I would highly recommend this drill as a quality product. It also has good ergonomics and lots of torque. I have experienced NO problems with the drill I bought new. The repair to the other drill was made necessary more due to an abusive first owner than to any problem of the drill itself. I just took it to the wrong shop for repairs. I do wish it had a single-sleeve chuck. The double-sleeve chuck works fine, but you can tighten a single-sleeve cuck with one hand - a bit more convenient."
5,Beefy !,"I'm a huge fan of cordless tools. I use them every day all day long. The 18v Makita is a wonderful tool. ""Powerful"", is an understatement.They're sooo smooth!( Love those ball bearings )I have had two now for 4 months.They are a direct replacement for 2 18v yellow drills that weren't holding up. I can't dog DeWalt, because they make too many good products. The new makita's are the most durable drills I have ever seen. I've had 35 from all the major manufacturers in the past 5 years.They are kind of heavy to use all day long .However they are lighter than the DeWalt and Milwaukee 18v drills.The new 24v drills are way too heavy for extended use."
4,It broke,"Last November, I purchased a Makita 18 volt. I used it minimally, as I charged the batteries no more than thirty times. One day, I compared it to a friend's Bosch 24 volt, and as I expected, the Bosch outperformed it. I didn't mind this, however,as the Makita is lighter and has a much better feel. As I was finishing a hole, however, the clutch suddenly broke. I tried drilling another hole, and the same thing happened. I went back to the store I purchased it from, and the manager was nice enough to replace it. Now, I am a little bit leary about straining this tool to the point of lock-up. Overall, I think it was just one bad tool that escaped from the Makita plant, and I am very impressed with the run-time and the power, and would recommend this tool."
5,Drywall mud? Try tile grout!,"I have had this drill for almost two years and have had no problems. I have used it to run a 17"" long 1"" dia. bit through top plates, and have also mixed a 25lb. bag of tile grout. Felt a little guilty about the tile grout, but the drill ate it up. I did use low speed for both jobs. This drill is also great for concrete anchors. I have drilled 1/2"" dia. holes into concrete with ease. This is a nice drill"
2,Bought It - Returned It,The price seemed right and it appeared well built. But I found the table frustrating to use.Pros1. Solidly built2. Relatively easy speed changes with speeds clearly marked3. Good manualCons1. Table too small2. Awkward adjusting table height3. Underneath of table is open and ribbed which makes clamping difficult3. Depth guage on left side fell off during assembly4. A little rattle at the higher speed. Just enough to be annoying. Never could pin it down.Summary5 stars for functionality and good construction-2 stars for the table-1 star for the depth guage====2 stars overall.The frustration of working with the table may steer you to the 12 inch model. It appears to be the better product although at twice the price.
2,Not for everyone,It's not my thing. It's too... sweet(?) for my liking. I tried to give it to my dad but he didn't want it either. I've been spraying it on my dogs in the morning instead of throwing it away.
3,pretty good,"I have about 14 Wadada Leo Smith cd's. This ranks about 9th. It is slower than hisother ones. As usual with Music, Movies and just about everything else go to the 70'sfor the best of Arts and Entertainment. Everything was creative, introspective and not digitally enhanced .........oh the 70's........."
3,good gift,"I got it for my sister, she likes that show. If you like it or know somebody that does then get it i suppose"
1,No way a 5 star product,"with colors changing if exposed to any type of sunlight, its totally unacceptable, you buy this product for a specific coloration, for it to change from a finished product to something totally unwanted due to exposure to sunlight is just NOT acceptable"
3,"Works fine, but changes colours.",I bought them just for fun to make some colourful cupcakes. I added a bit of the Sky Blue. It did look nice but later on in the day it turned a grey-purple colour. Not really sure why. I didn't read the review until now realizing it had happened to other people. =/
4,I love it,"The gel colors this brand are very good, with only small amounts desired shade is achieved. The price is reasonable and the product quality is very good"
1,Do NOT Buy This Product! Color Completely Changed!,"Before I bought this product I read through all the reviews and was sceptically about the one negative review about the color changing, but that's EXACTLY what happened to me! I made this beautiful cake for my sister's birthday with fuchsia daisies around it, which turn a disgusting grayish-mauve color when the sunlight hit the cake while I was transporting it to the party (30 min. drive). Thank goodness this cake was just a gift for my sister, because I would have be absolutely infuriated if this had happened for an important event."
1,very bitter ruined the cake,i bought four wilton gel colors. be warned they r very very bitter. they ruined the cake and turned out to be a very disappointing memory. never again.
2,Wilton Icing Colors,"Wilton.......shame,shame,shame,have bought MANY Wilton products,all have been great,except this one,I agree with other reviewers that these colors DO change colors and often make the cake look very unappealing,or in my wifes case she made a cake to co ordinate with decorations etc,and as with other reviewers,DID change color and she was very disappointed,sadly wont be on my re buy list and am frankly surprised a good company wouldnt research the quality of a product prior to release.Just my personal opinion.Will continue to buy Wilton products,but not this one."
3,"Good, but not best for the money.","The icing gels themselves are very good. They work well and color incing pretty true to the intended color when you use enough. The awesome thing is that the consistency of the gels do little to affect the consistency of the icing, but do a lot to color it. The problem with this set is that it is not the best way to get these icings. It is okay for someone who doesn't do a lot of decorating or who doesn't need a lot in these particular colors. However, if you want anything other than pastel colors, these jars will run out fast, and buying this set is not as cost-effective as buying the larger 1 oz bottles, even on sale. In conclusion, the product itself is awesome!, but be sure to price out the cost difference between this set and individual bottles which may be even closer to the colors you want. ^_^"
5,Got Organization??,"I know this ""tickler file"" - (what is a tickler file? It's an expanding file with tabs 1-31 and months - sometimes a-z, whre you can slide important papers pertinent to that particular day) may be considered somewhat obsolete, but I have relied on them forever. I am an admin asst with a busy schedule which requires a lot of printed material for my boss. This keeps me organized day by day for the month. I highly recommend this."
2,Not impressive,"I bought the more expensive version even though I couldn't find a difference in product description. I was hoping for quality. However, it is shabby. I may as well had saved a few bucks. Excess glue made the sections stick together and I had to pull them apart. Then, it was flimsy. It is a good concept; just needs better construction."
4,Great Idea,"This is perfect for keeping organized at work, especially on items which need follow up.Nice quality, I may buy one for home too."
3,Pendaflex Expanding File,I was pleased for the speedy delivery but disappointed for my particular needs. I needed something that was closed in on the sides. I do love ordering from Amazon - they are great!
5,An excellent reference book,"I found Engelking a difficult book to study general topology from, but an excellent reference book. Engelking covers wide areas of General topology, starting from the basic definition. At times the exposition seemed to veer into too much technicalities, which seemed to distract one, if one was reading the book alone. What makes the book truly great, however, is its index, and bibliography. It's wealth of examples and counterexamples is very useful, as well.Finally, the Russian translation seems to be enriched with the comments of translators and more bibliography."
1,up-oh,"Okay so I thought I actually previewed this albulm before I bought it. I hate that I am not creative and deep enough to enjoy the same beat, over and over and over and over again. and over again."
2,Thoroughly Boring,"I thought this movie was so boring. It was so trying to be Two can play that game, but nowhere near as good. The practically going straight to video should've been my cue, but alas I gave it a try on account of Vivica. I am very thankful that I did not buy it and only rented it. In my opinion it wasn't funny, it wasn't sexy yet it seemed like it was attempting to be a romantic comedy. I kid you not, the only part in the movie that I did laugh at was Ticia Arnold and the man she was with and the bloopers at the end. That's pretty bad. Trust me, save your money and your time."
3,Good for cheap,"I found it somewhat predictable but overall still enjoyable. Carmen, Stacy, & Vivica provide plenty of PG-13 eye candy for the guys. There are also buff shirtless guys for the ladies."
4,Great Movie!,Great movie!!! A total recommendation for anyone who likes to educate themselves on the opposite sex. It was everything I was looking for in a movie!
2,just aight,"Stacy Dash is still stuffed. I love that Chick. Vivica A Fox&Carmen Electria are banging as well.Bill Bellamy is in another Broke Boomerang meets How to be a Player type role that is very predictable,but has a few aight moments. not alot going on."
5,Interdesign Magnectic cup,This was a gift to a elderly friend for her to use and put things in so she wouldknow that they would stay in and not be damaged. I have seen it and it was a great gift and she agreed.
2,cheap,"There is nothing wrong with the cup itself, but the first time I hung it on the magnet board, full of chalk, the magnet fell off of the cup & the cup fell on the floor. Would be fine if a better adhesive was used. The scotch tape I used to fix it with is stronger than the original adhesive."
1,"Cheaply-Made, Poorly-Executed","I was very disappointed in this DVD. Aside from being lit and directed poorly, there was little to no variation in the camera angles, the sound was mastered poorly, the teacher was nearly impossible to hear over the mildly-grating music, and the moves were not well-taught. The little routines were cute enough, but they weren't really something that could be followed and imitated easily. It just wasn't very engaging.My daughter really enjoyed Yoga Kids (by Gaiam/Living Arts), which I thought was a far better example of a well-made educational/exercise kids' video."
2,Disappointing,"It is a bit disappointing. I am looking for a more technically oriented video. The exercise being done in the video is fun and interesting and my 2 year old like it a lot. However, the ""models"" are not quite up to standard. My daughter asked me ""why don't they point their toes and jump properly?"" Kids like to copy, a good model is very important."
5,Great DVD,"I purchased this DVD, because it came recommended by other dance teachers. I found the material to be age appropriate and highly creative. I was disappointed that the music included with the DVD was not on a CD where I could use it in the classroom. This DVD was helpful in generating new ideas for my classes."
3,Just like being in a class,"I bought this video for my daughters who were too shy to be in a ballet class with all the other children. This video was just like being in the class. Literally. They basically set up a video camera in one corner of the dance studio and filmed the class. So it get a bit boring for my little ones to see the same scenery, etc. and it's like watching a home video. That said, my oldest appreciated that ""it was just like our ballet class"" and enjoyed learning the steps and terminology. This is a decent substitute if you can't enroll your children in a real pre-ballet class."
2,Painful to watch,"I may not be qualified to write a review on this video, because I have zilch ballet knowledge. However, I did purchase it and am at this very moment being forced to listen to it for the third time in three years. I think I will make it ""disappear"" tomorrow. On the positive side, the songs sound sweet. However, all they did was film a ballet class! And, the teacher seems tense, cranky and very intent on the kids in the class doing the ballet moves ""properly"". My God, these kids are preschoolers! Unless they're prodigies who need extra challenge, let them be kids and have fun! My five year old daughter fortunately is lucky enough to have a real dance class with a teacher who has loads of enthusiasm and energy who doesn't pressure the girls to conform to strict dance forms so early."
4,Very good for the intended audience,"Okay, let's look at the date of composition. The comments about camera angle and technical filming are irrelevant. This video is full of excellent instruction that engages a child in dance without stressing the particulars of turnout, etc. For a very young child of 2-4 it helps them to engage with someone other than their parent in an activity that is probably new to them. I have this program on VHS... sure that's how big a spread of children I have... and am now looking to buy it on DVD because the other one is WORN OUT. Coupe the cricket still reigns in our house, long after the teenagers have become too busy to take dance lessons!"
2,Can't Judge a Book By It's Cover,The info contained in the book was good but the condition of the outer cover was a little poor.
3,TESS MALLORY,"This is the third book in the series. Each friend has her own story. Jix Ferguson in Highland Dream, Chelsea Brown in Highland Fling, and Samantha Riley in Highland Magic. Tess Mallory is such a great author and I love all her books, but...I did not like the characters Jix Ferguson or Samantha Riley. Chelsea was more or less neglected in this threesome friendship. They were actually very cruel to her and made fun of her behind her back. She is my favorite female character from all three of these books. The male characters are fine and very likeable. Samantha is just horribly insensitive and a nonsympathetic character and got a man who certainly could have done much much better.The only reason I read this third book, and it took months to do it, is because it was three-book series."
3,Not the best of the three,Samantha Riley is the heroine is this book and best friend of Jix (book 1) and Chelsea (book 2). It took me forever to warm up the Sam due to her attitude. But in the end she came around and saw in herself what other people knew was in her heart. There were time you just want to shake her and say what the hell is your problem. I did enjoy the first 2 books more that this one.
2,Three strikes...,I am not into time traveling books or when the heros desire the heroine from page one. The story also seemed too predictable. I stopped reading the book around page 60.
1,Dirty Sanchez DVD,The DVD would not play and the company who sells it on Amazon has no return policy so I'm out the money I spent for the movie.
1,Keep your day job,"This was one of the worst books I have read in the last several years. Actually, I didn't read it all. After about 1/3 of the way I sent it into the recycling bin. I didn't even want to pass it on. I certainly did not want any of my acquaintances to know that I read such banal stuff. Mr. Greco should ""keep his day job"" and take some writing lessons. The book is full of old clichés with very little substance to the whole story. I got the recommendation from Jimmy Buffet's website. Jimmy should really review his recommendations closer. I actually rate it below one star."
2,Hope you speak French!,"The poster itself looks pretty nice, but you can't get a good look at the text on the poster. It is in fact in French. And there's no real warning or notice that the poster is printed in French."
1,DO NOT BUY GATEWAY !,"DO NOT BUY GATEWAY !...Broken unit without any support.After waiting 2 weeks for the productit arrived defective. It would not even power on.Seeing that it was only a few days until Christmas,I went to my local Gateway store (40 miles away) for service.The store would not deal with any Amazon.com purchase.I then spent half a day on the phone with Gateway customer service/abuse.Gateway refused to provide any support to any product not purchased through them.Even though this is an official Gateway branded product.One technician (JJ - possibly badge#010) was particularly rude.Gateway just didn't care that I had a defective Gateway product.My family was thinking about buying a computer & digital camera.Now, after this aggravation with Gateway, I will definitelynever recommend any Gateway product ... never.Stay far awayfrom Gateway !"
4,nice player,I think this is a great little player. Lots of options for a good price. USB is great for loading songs. Very easy. Only place I think Gateway cut a corner is the earbuds aren't very good. Otherwise a great unit.
1,Was good until it quit working....,"I have had this since August of 04....so close to a year....I loved it when I first got it......then I started noticing problems, it would shut off, or the buttons wouldnt work, or not to mention the paint almost completely chipped off. Now, for about 2 months it hasnt been working. I am still using it as a data storage device, because amazingly enough that function still works, but What I bought it to do, play music doesnt work at all.....To sum it up, i dont think that if i even had a Gateway service place around my house I would take it there, because even when it worked I didnt like it.....I dont recomend this at all......"
3,Be careful,"After seeing the defect with it, and repairing it, it's been a fine blower, operating quietly and consistently."
5,I was a glidermen on D-Day. Best account ever!,"I was a battalion commander and glidermen in the 101st Airborne Division for the D-Day operations. I was also one of the consultants for the movie ""The Longest Day"". Over the last 50 years I've endeavored to read as many books as I could on the subject of D-Day, Airborne and the American and British gliders used in the D-Day operations. ""Glidermen of Neptune"" is the most accurate, clear, consise and lucid accounts of the D-Day glider operations I've ever read. It is an excellent book and an invaluable resource on the subject. I recommended it to my son, who is an instructor at the War College and uses it as a reference book in his class. I applaud Mr. Masters for his fine book."
5,Well written,"An extremely well written, consise and informative book about a little known area of WWII. I bought three and gave them as gifts. Eached recipient raved."
3,Smaller than it appears,"Honestly, I did not pay much attention to the size ont he advertisement. But this toy was smaller than it appeared online. However, it appears to be very hight quality. I am saving it for my son for when he is a little older."
2,Our Oriental Heritage,"Jesse Cook started as a guitarist, however what I hear now is music, with little guitar, it is hidden behind the vocals and the oriental sounds. Jesse had created some good guitar music with mild background which emphasized the guitar. Now it is a mix, which guitar is a part of, and the others by the way are not good. I used to buy his albums because I liked his style of music, guitar especially, now it seems like if he is a western, eastern music artist. Free fall was where these two styles abuted now it is compeletly to the east. If you are buying this album because of guitar, it is a mistake. If you liked the eastern blend of free fall this is the album. This album should have been named Our Oriental Heritage and I think it is its alias."
2,"A departure from his first 3 albums, but not a good one.","I am a Jesse Cook fan - or at least I am a fan of his earlier work. I was quite excited to receive his new Nomad CD, but it is a big disappointment. Although he appears to be attempting to expand his sound and appeal, the departure from his guitar/flamenco base with the addittion of a taste of India, just doesn't work. Gone is the demonstration of his true guitar talents and of a sound that lifted and motivated."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"When ""Nomad"" was first released I happened to be at a Borders where Jesse was appearing to promote his new CD. While he was performing I noticed he played very few cuts off ""Nomad"", instead he mostly played favorites from his other CDs. After listening to all the songs on Nomad I realized why - they all SUCK! I think Jesse was aware of that too otherwise he would have played more than the 3 that he did while performing live."
1,"CD is copy protected, may not play on your CD player","Well I heard some sample tracks on the radio and decided to buy this CD. Too bad I can't play it on my stereo. The problem is the CD has copy protection and is incompatible with some CD players. As a result I don't think I will buy any more CDs, rather I will just download them for free. Too bad the marketing geniuses strategy just backfired.Amazon should indicate if a CD is copy protected.Buyer beware, you may be buying a CD that you can't play"
5,Nomad,"I really loved this album anyone who likes Jesse Cook is sure to like this one it's Falmenco and it's not, wonderful mix of two Clutures I love the Singing and the Violins the whole album is Fantastic."
3,"Copy protected, but able to use it on my Mac","I was dismayed to see that the CD was copy protected. I would have liked to have known that before purchasing it.iTunes wouldn't import a playable version using its built-in encoder. But, I was able to import it into iTunes on my Mac by using the iTunes-LAME encoder, available at:http://www.blacktree.com/apps/iTunes-LAME/"
5,Excellent record - highly recommended,"This is a masterpiece. Excellen t record. It is very unique, a blend of flamenco, Middle-Eastern music, Latin music and jazz. Hard to compartmentalize. Very dense. You can listen to it for hours and you would still find something new that you have not noticed before. Jesse's music is like a canvas. It is so reach and layered. Highly recommended. I own all his CDs and I was twice to his concert. He is a guitar virtuoso and an amazing and original artist. This is his best record in my opinion."
5,Jesse Cook is GREAT!,I am so glad that Jesse Cook uses his and other's expertise to bring so much really great music to us. I have ended up with all of his recordings. That has never happened before with another artist. Many times I have bought other's albums and have only liked one or two songs and that wasn't a good thing. I loved the Middle Eastern flavor of Nomad! I came on this site to see if there were any new albums out. Go Jesse! Another album would be nice too!!:)
5,High definition,"I had this projector for over a year. Use of DVD9 format video input will provide awesome detail on my 104"" wide screen. It is highly recommended."
1,Don't waste your money,"I thought my children would love this. I have two toddlers first of all the water that comes out of the head goes over the front of the head and not into the pool and the size is no where near what they show. I think they say it's about 8' long or so, they say on the box actually sizes may vary. I'd say the pool is about half the size of what they show and no where as deep."
2,Bad design...,"I definitely agree that the pool is smaller than I expected, and the sprayer shoots the water in front of the pool. My daughter still enjoys it though, and I guess that's what really counts. Of course, she is equally happy in a Rubbermaid storage bucket filled with water, so go figure."
2,Smaller than pictured,"I agree with the other reviews, the picture makes this pool look a lot larger than it actually is. The fill line on the pool makes the water come to about my 5yr old daughter's ankles. My [...] old enjoyed it, perfect size for her. We had the pool on our patio for a couple of days and the bottom some how got a tear in it. I'm searching now for a bigger/better pool."
4,Great for the price,"For the money, these bits are great. Arrived on time in nice wooden case. I have been using MLCS bits for years and will continue to do so. I would have given them 5 stars were it not for the fact that I have used other bits that hold their edge much longer."
1,review,"This book is useless for anything except, perhaps, starting a fire. Got no useable info from it. Definitely not worth the money."
3,poor edition of an interesting book,"This is a very interesting book, but I can hardly recommend this edition. For some reason they did not include any of the illustrations of the original book. The lack of illustrations is very obvious, since the text refers to various illustrations, which are simply not included. In addition, the publishers did a very poor job of proofreading the text, leaving in numerous obvious errors, both of punctuation and misspelling. Also, NO additional information is provided for modern readers, in the way of notes, definitions of words that are no longer currently in use, etc. In short, this is a very poor edition of this book."
2,Fragile,"Three days after I put this on my keyring, the two parts of the Highgear Smartlatch broke apart and I couldn't put them back together. Then, a week later, the compass popped out of the case. It's now in my tool drawer. Perhaps, only mine was this fragile?"
1,Stay away from this,"I bought this just because it would separate, but it only took about a week for the compass to fall out and a couple of weeks later for the clock to stop working and about 3 months for the two piece not to connect any more, so now it's in the trash"
1,Atrocious,"After reading the case, I rented this at Blockbuster based on the top-notch cast and what sounded like a good, cute, funny plot. Tiptoes is none of those things.The acting was bad and that was surprising given the cast. I could not feel any sort of connection between Matthew McConaughey and Kate Beckinsale - much less that they could be living together and expecting a child.Gary Oldman is painful to watch - he hobbles around cramped into a dwarf outfit. Very Dorf-ish.And I have no idea what Peter Dinklage and Patricia Arquette added to the movie. They seem like they are from a completely different movie.The acting seems like it was done in one take. It was very painful trying to make it through 90 minutes of this trainwreck. All and all, a total disaster."
1,Ack!,"From the box, this film looked interesting, and I've always liked Kate Beckinsale (plus it had some other big names, so I figured it couldn't be too bad), so I thought I'd get it. Gary Oldman's character seems to have two emotions: grumpy and sweet. Matthew McConaughey is always pissed about something, Patricia Arquette and her boyfriend have no real reason for even being in the movie, and there are so many plot holes it's distracting. It was a waste of my time and money."
1,Don't tiptoe away from this movie...RUN!!!!!!!!!,"I recently rented this film (if you can call it a film...) on a whim. If you get feel this same whim coming on, stop it. Consider this your warning, because if you do decided to watch this pathetic attempt of a movie, you will have wasted approximately 90 minutes of your life that you will never ever get back. The script is horribly written and every moment is overdramatized, turning the good-intentioned message of the film into a cheesy piece of crap that is completely unviewable. In fact, I'm amazed I made it through the whole thing."
1,Seriously what is this?!!,"Ok, so I watched this hoping for a good laugh being that Tosh recommended it. This movie isn't even funny bad, it is just plain awful. The movie is about a guy who is living with a girl. The guys is the only no midget in his family. Only, his brother is played by a guy pretending to be a midget. He walks around on his knees the entire movie and looks so weird. Then guy and girl have a baby, it is a midget. They break up and she goes with the fake midget brother. WHY???????????? What was the point of all of this?! Don't waste your time, you won't even get laughs for this being cheesy funny. It is through and through awful."
4,Refreshing !!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I had picked it up because I saw Oldman's name (was that really him? he looked so realistically dwarf-like - how did they *do* that ?!), but wasn't sure just what to expect. Somehow the cast came together to deliver superb performances all around, yet with that hard-to-reach restraint that adds such realism. The respect and sensitivity displayed between the characters was refreshing. I think tho, that you have to be prepared to watch it with a sense of half-fantasy/half-archetype; sit back and enjoy the costumes and get over the literal hangups - the same as you might have done with Edward Scissorhands. If you can't do that, you won't be happy. Personally, I give everyone in the cast my full kudos."
1,terrible,"One of the worst, most absurdly scripted movies I have ever seen. The film takes what could be a very interesting topic and makes it utterly ridiculous.The characters played by Beckinsale and McConaughey are idiotic, their relationship is uncompelling, and their dialog is insultingly simple.The plot wanders with no focus on the crux of the issue.And can someone please tell me what being possessed Kate Beckinsale's hair throughout this waste of two hours?"
3,TIPTOES Film as featured on Tosh.O,"I had to see this film for myself after hearing about it on TOSH.0Daniel Tosh put extra effort into the plot description of this strange film. There wasn't room enough for his entire presentation on his show, but someone could go to his website to see the entire thing. He had me when he mentioned that there was a Dwarf as a character. I have a lot of respect for Little People of America and I wanted to see if this fellow was a serious actor or not. What a complicated plot! The movie is not a masterpiece at all. And definitely not for children."
2,Tip Toes,"This movie is about a guy, named Steven, who is the only normal sized person in his family. The rest are all dwarves, including his twin brother. He only decides to tell his girlfriend, Carol, when she becomes pregnant and they have to discuss the possibility that the child will also be a dwarf.I liked this movie until the end. I could understand when Steven reacts badly to the pregnancy and when the baby turns out as a dwarf. But I hated that they had Carol, after Steven left her because he did not know how to deal with it all, starts a relationship with the brother. Not because he was a dwarf but because it seems the only reason she does it is because the brother is willing to help raise the baby and act like a father figure. In my opinion this ruined an otherwise pleasant movie about overcoming hardship and growing up."
1,Wasted potential,"This movie could have been something, but it blows every chance it gets.An example: The full-grown man who can't accept his son's dwarfism proclaims, ""I am a dwarf!"" A very powerful statement of his self-hatred, but the movie skims right over it -- No pondering, no exploration.Peter Dinklage is the one stand-out performance here. He's talented and full of life.Gary Oldman was wasted. His character was this guy that just waddled around. He and Dinklage should have been the main focus of the film. The ""love affair"" between McConaughey and Beckinsale is what ruined this film.This movie opened my eyes to what a terrible actor Matthew McConaughey really is. All cheeky grins and no substance. It's not all his fault; there are writers and editors and a whole cast to blame for this stinker!When it comes down to it, there is no mesh between the elements of this film. Stick with the classics and watch ""Freaks."""
1,stooooooooooopid!,"This movie stunk. R-rated for no reason. should have been G or maybe a light PG. McConaGay can't act and beckinStale is just barely decent to look at. At the end she ends up with the midget brother instead of being with the full sized mconagay character. I fell asleep and had to watch it two times to catch the funny ending. Then ending makes me thinkt he producers and directors and writers were playin a big joke. Its a good movie if you like mockin lil people. I think willow and LOTR are good for laughin at the under-priviliged. Dont waste your time - something better would be Rocky 3 or anything with Mr. T in it. Black and White has Mike Tyson in it and that makes it awesome. Also, the nightmare on elm streets and friday the 13th's are entertaining."
3,Buy it,"Odd character line up but kinda cool. Gary Oldman plays a midget i.e. DORF......yeah knees tucked into pants and everything. Permiscuous midgets and horny non-vertically challenged adults as well keep the film interesting. We have drugs, sex, violence, and a decent and original story. Deffinately worth a viewing."
3,Fair price for a marginal movie,"I expected more from the movie. Though the product was purchased at a very good price, the movie was a disappointment. This is not intended to ridicule the merchant though. The merchant did a swell job!"
1,Terrible,"I like odd films, however this movie was beyond explanation. I'll need to watch it again in case it was supposed to be a black comedy and I just missed it. If the movie is indeed supposed to be a drama, it is indeed the worst I've seen. Characters aren't believable, acting is poor, plot is hard to follow, storyline is unrealistic, movie runs too long and then just stops without tying up any loose ends. Don't bother watching."
2,Gary Oldman is the only reason to see this...,"This is a train wreck of a movie. The only redeeming quality is seeing Gary Oldman playing the dwarf brother. That man can do anything onscreen. From Dracula, to Sirius Black, Beethoven, Joe Orton, and the Lt. in Batman--he is simply amazing with an incredible range. However, his talent overshadows all of the other BAD acting in this film. I mean BAD. Matthew McConaughey CANNOT act. Kate Beckinsale was great in Serendipity, but here she sports an unnatural American accent and fake-looking tattoos. Patricia Arquette is an absolute disaster and a totally unnecessary character. Peter Dinklage is talented--but why the French accent? It is unfortunate, but I think that this film does the exact opposite of what its intentions were, which was to get the viewer to understand and root for the little people. It doesn't do that. They are very much exploited here."
1,An absurd movie with no resolution,"This movie could have had a very important moral lesson, but it fails on many levels. The characters are very artificial and quite lacking in real-life characteristics. The dialog is stilted and none of the characters seem to have more than one emotion throughout the movie. The ending is what really kills this movie. Drama is built upon conflict, good movies have some sort of resolution that the conflict. This movie resolves nothing; it ends with the wife kissing her husband's dwarf brother. All the ending seems to imply is that the husband cannot change, but the repercussions are not explored. The wife never actually tries to convince or help the husband change; she just pleads. On a side note, this movie is rated 'R' for the use of the ""F"" word."
1,omg wtf,the A-list of actors taking a piss at a subject that gets little to no attention. gary oldmans worst movie ever? THE worst movie ever? glad i only spent 3 bucks
1,Worst Online game ever,"The people in warner bros, destroyed the story of the matrix completely.The gameplay sucks. You have little control on your character when you fight.The instances are all the same, and they are all in buildings that have the same architecture. Is not worted paying 49 dollars for this game, i reccomend you spent them and WOW"
1,No Mac version - this sucks,I can't believe that the developers would make this a PC-only game!!! I think that really sucks. Shame on you Warner Bros.
4,This game is no longer active.,"As much as I loved this game and my 3 years playing it, don't bother buying it. SoE shut it down at the end of 2008, despite a large outcry from the small, but extremely dedicated, playerbase. There is a fan-run emulation site (mxoemu.info), but they host a downloadable version of the client, so purchasing the game discs would be an absolute waste."
1,Cancelled,"I don't know why this is even still available for purchase on this site, because the game was cancelled and all servers shut down -2 years ago- in 2009. This product is nothing more than a $30 box.If you'll look, you'll notice the last review was in 2005."
2,Matrix Unbalanced,"Sony Online Entertainment took The Matrix Online offline in 2009. This product will not work in any way without their servers being up & running and many cumulative patches applied to both the launcher and the game. Therefore, unless you are looking for a collectible disc to stick on a shelf, do not expect this game to work. The game that shipped in this box was very quickly overhauled when, shortly after launch, WB Interactive dropped the game into Sony's lap and let them figure out what to do with it. It had 5 years of patches (and still many bugs) before the plug was finally pulled."
3,I am not sure what to think of it,"I am a 69 year old male, not particularly strong, but fairly active. I have never tried a bar like this, so it is an adventure. I use my knee to start the bending, but I can then use it with arms only. I would prefer one of the patented adjustable chest exercise devices that is imported, but they are more expensive than I want. I think this one will be useful after I get better at using it. I do not use the wrist loops because if I let go and the rod snaps out straight, I fear it might break my wrist. This thing is not a toy."
2,Less than perfect,"Very pretty necklace, but the chain was faulty on our original delivery and it broke when removing it from the box. Exchanged the product for one with large flaws in the stone. Tried to exchange again and was told to return the product for a refund. A pity. If the first one had a better chain this would get higher marks from us."
5,Great value,It works great for the function it is intended. AM & FM works great but it is a little deaf for SW. Cranking it up for power is an excellent choice when not having AA batteries at hand.
3,"Okay, But Not the Best","I do not own this radio, but bought 2 of them as gifts for family members. When I visited the recipient of one of them, they wanted me to see the radio. I was kind of embarrased by it actually. The thing is way too light and cheap feeling. Does it work? Yes. Is the tuning accurate? Not really... the dial type tuner is hard to see the exact station you are trying to find. Would I buy another of the same brand? Not likely."
4,"Great Pomade, Great Smell","I cut my hair very short. My hair does not like to cooperate and this stuff convinces my hair otherwise. It holds really good and smells great - really nice coconut smell. It is high quality. It claims not to be greasy, but it is somewhat but much better than other brands I've tried. It is not cheap, but I keep buying it because nothing else I've found works as good holding my hair."
1,Horrible toy!!!,"I have ordered 3 of these air hockey tables all of them have the same problem, A SMOKING motor. I could not get my money bak fast enough! I only put one star because the page forced me to."
1,Are these defective products?,"I have a few pieces of the Wilton Armetale Reggae line, which I purchased from a department store and which I enjoy. So I purchased two of these petite trays from Amazon, and they arrived looking like defective products, both of them. I expected the petite trays to have a smooth, bright shiny surface (like my others). Rather, both trays are dull gray and the surface is the texture of an orange peel! In addition, the carved design around the edges should be filled with black ink (or whatever that is), but portions of the carvings are not even colored. In short, I was shocked and disappointed in the quality of this product. I wonder if Amazon is selling defective goods that didn't pass the muster for a department store."
2,just ok,seems to be well made. its a lot smaller then sizing says. it has interchangeable color sides. it has too many pockets and could do without bladder holder. not bad overall just wish it could hold a thermos. thx
4,"Great Tank Bag, After Modifications","I'm using this tank bag with a Suzuki C50 Boulevard. I had to cut off the handle to still have visibility for the tank-mounted speedometer which was a bummer but not so much a product defect. I'm planning on cutting off the straps holding the plastic strap attachments though, since I noticed my paint was getting scuffed up pretty badly underneath.I've done about 1000 miles with the bag and it's felt secure and comfortable to ride with. I love having a bag that's so easy to get to during riding, especially while dealing with things like water bladders and headphones!"
1,Card Games for Little Kids,"This book would be a great boon for little kids if the required special deck of cards accompanied it!Unfortunately, the book is worthless without the cards, and try as I may I can't seem to get the deck from distributor or publisher. Amazon kindly reimbursed me my money for this transaction."
2,This fan is NOISY,"Installed per instructions, but fan has a loud hum at all speeds except OFF. Not an air movement sound, a motor hum sound. All connections are tight. Don't know if this is a product problem or just amplification of normal noise. After all, the fireplace is 100% sheet metal and adding a fan turns it into a giant speaker.E-mailed manufacturer-they offered to replace fan. It was a difficult installation and I don't look forward to removing-mailing-waiting-reinstalling just to find out the noise is normal.Does move air even at low-medium speeds to warm the room more efficiently than the fireplace did with no fan."
2,Noisy Fan,This fan is noisy I would recommend finding a different fan for your fireplace. Also keep in mind when installing this fan that the outlet under the fireplace may not be hooked up. It will require additional work.
2,The best part of this book is the peacock!,"I think the idea behind this book is creative. I like the author's attempt to create round characters out of infamous women who have, for the most part, been remembered in history as one-dimensional. What I don't like is the way the author tries to ""save"" these women, cast them in a better light. Maybe some of these women were whores. But that's o.k. because ""whore"" hasn't always had such negative connotations. Pagan cultures had holy whores who honored the Goddess. I guess I'm getting off track here, but it just bothered me that the author seemed to be so caught up in defusing the word ""whore,"" in proving that these women were innocents. So they had sex--so what!"
1,Release Seasons 5-9 instead please - no more repackaging!,Please release seasons 5-9!!!!! Been waiting since Jan 2009. What is the point of releasing the same episodes under different categories we just want the rest of the seasons
3,touched by angel,"I truly love this series but I don't understand why they won't release the remaining seasons. I just wish if they plan to release the episodes this way, PLEASE stop releasing episodes that are already on dvd. PLEASE! PLEASE!"
5,Brings a sense of peace to you.,"These episodes highlight Gods' love for us, our love for Him, and how we should love one another in a Godly way. While not a replacement for a Church Service-they can help teach to youngsters as well as non-believers what true Christianity is all about. Sometimes learning ""by example"" works best in a fictional story setting like these. Whether alone or with close family or friends you can allow your emotions to have free reign while viewing and not keep the worlds view of ""manly"" control of yourself."
3,Touched by an Angel,This dvd was good but I was hoping for the entire season to come out. I already have 3 of the 4 episodes and I was hoping to get some that I didn't already have.
5,Amazing war documentary!!,"This is an amazing documentary, with the real war veterans involved in the resistance giving interviews. With great footage and re-enactments, i was thoroughly immersed in their stories. A very sad story but also heroic. This battle was a major factor which determined the allies victory due to the Nazis being delayed in Crete/Greece long enough so when the Nazis reached Russia they experienced the middle of the coldest Winter."
1,Megaloser,"The chopper flew 2 mins crashed and broke You can order another blade for $5.95 direct from the company. For $50 for 2 mins, I can think of better ways to have fun....."
3,Megachopper woes,"I was really pleased to get the chopper for christmas. I flew it onceand it seemed to perform pretty good for the first couple minutes, it then started to smoke and then really smoked. I landed it and shut it off immediately. It had to be sent back to Megatech for repair or replacementto date no Chopper. It'll be a week today. Disappointed."
1,Not As Advertised,"This helicopter was not as advertised on their website. It only goes up and down - can't be steered. They were very nice about returning it, however."
3,"HUGH WILSON, OPUS 5","**1/2 1996. Based on Olivia Goldsmith's The First Wives Club. and directed by Hugh Wilson. One nomination for the Oscar in the Best Music, Original Musical or Comedy Score category. Three wives dumped by their husbands decide to take revenge and found the First Wives Club. Weak and harmless comedy with three good actresses but, alas, with no director to guide them. Already forgotten."
5,One of my Favorite Movies,"Such a fun movie, with 3 great actresses. All three play off each other perfectly. Enjoy!"
2,Did not follow instructions...,My name is Donna Frost and I live in New Zealand. Upon ordering this dvd I asked specifically if it could be an all region copy so that it would work in New Zealand. Once I received it the message was this dvd is the wrong region. This dvd does not exist in NZ as it is obselete. I would appreciate a copy that is correct sent to me.Thank youDonna Frost
4,Okay.....,"I thought this was going to be really stupid, and it certainly started out that way, but it got a lot better, and it soon had me laughing."
1,Mean-spirited,"First Wives' Club is the story of four friends who had met in college. When one commits suicide after her husband's remarriage, the other three reunite at her funeral. They find they all have been embittered by their husbands' leaving for younger women, and set out to destroy their husbands financially.(...)"
1,Lacking a certain perspective,"First Wives' Club is the story of four friends who had met in college. When one commits suicide after her husband's remarriage, the other three reunite at her funeral. They find they all have been embittered by their husbands' leaving for younger women, and set out to destroy their husbands financially."
1,For women who hate men.....,"I hated this movie. I didn't so much hate it at the beginning when they were in the middle of getting together and all, but when they started doing all that bad stuff to their ex-husbands.This movie did NOT make me feel good at all. It depressed me. It enraged me. I never saw the 3 guys ever do anything back.What they did to those guys was just plain mean. I mean, what the hell did the death of their 4th friend have to do with their ex-husbands cheating on them? I mean, it's one thing to teach them a lesson when they're still married, but when they're divorced, that means they are ENTITLED to have the freedom to go for other women.Men get dumped by women all the time for better-looking guys, but you don't see these guys putting their ex-wives through that kind of hell.I don't understand how women can actually like this movie. It's just awful and mean."
1,The thrill of sexist violence,"This movie dramatizes and glorifies sexist violence against men. It is anti-men hate on film. If your a female who hates men, believes that men are bad, and loves to see men hurt, this movie is for you."
4,brilleint,This movie is a grate movie and it is really reall. I mean the story is not based on actuall charictors but this stuff really dose happen to evrey day people. This movie is well put. I recomed evreyone to see this and if you can get men to this say this is the way I will treet you if you leave me. ha!
4,crowd pleaser,This is just a good movies about divorcees and life.. and the little lessons on revenge.
5,Three great actresses in one hugely funny movie--laughed a lot!,"Four of us watched this movie on a sodden rainy night this week and even the two guys roared with laughter. We especially cracked up over the scene in which the three gals are coming down on the window cleaner's platform--with their hair straight up on end and screaming! Goldie Hawn never seems to age and is always able to melt your heart and make you laugh, and Diane Keaton and Bette Midler were super. The actresses playing the parts of the three college girls were dead-ringers for the actual mature actresses. I have been looking for this DVD at stores and even thrift stores for some time, but obviously everyone else loves it enough not to let it go--thank you for making it available. It was in excellent shape, too."
5,First wives Club,This is a wonderful woman's movie! Terrific actresses teamed together in a very funny movie. Every woman who has ever faced the treachery of a man should love it.
5,classic,"i loved this movie then, and i still do. this is a great, inspiring, uplifting girl movie that's perfect when you need a little boost ;)"
5,"Excellent, time after time","It only takes one event for years to seem like seconds, and to make friends realize what they mean to each other. Three former college friends figure that out when they meet up at the funeral of a fourth friend. When they find out what happened, they vow never to let another woman be tossed out like the trash simply because she's middle-aged. Bette Midler and Diane Keaton are both stellar, their characters are well-written and I want to be just like them when I grow up. First Wives Club is mostly a comedy, but there are a couple of touching moments as well. A really great movie I can watch again and again."
4,"Yeah, but I liked it anyway. Maybe it's Bette...","Some people will find this shallow. Some will think it's too easy on men because one marriage was reconciled. Others will think it was too hard on men. I, for one, never figured out what they were going to do at the center for women that they built, so that ""no woman will ever have to go through this again."" But it's not a how-to manual or a children's movie, and it wasn't written by activists (thank goodness). It was funny and poignant and a great evenings entertainment! Besides I like most anything Bette is in."
2,Girls Talk,"The First Wives Club is a good-humored but vaguely sadistic revenge picture billed as a madcap empowerment seminar. But madcap and zany? No way. For years, actresses have been complaining that strong roles for women are limited--if not absent--in Hollywood. I couldn't agree more, but the dearth is by no means aided by the dumber than dumb rampage of Brenda, Elise, and Annie (Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn, and Diane Keaton).If white men can't jump, white chicks can't dance, and try as it might to be hip and topical, The First Wives' Club instead becomes Waiting to Exhale for white, middle-aged, housefraus. And these three ain't shoopin' no-how. This movie's big-budget gets major mileage on small inspiration."
2,"Stellar cast, limpid script","Bland stuff, despite herculean efforts by the three leading ladies (Keaton is especially valiant). A criminal waste of the great Maggie Smith. For a rainy, RAINY Sunday afternoon."
3,"entertaining, but some propaganda","I found the movie entertaining. However, a central plot is thatfour women friends from the same college are dumped in theirmiddle age by their husbands for younger women. In reality, womeninitiate most divorces. They get preferential treatment withownership of the house, custody of the kids, and alimony.So, I think this movie is disguising the fact that, statistically,it's more like a First Husbands Club out there."
1,Mean-spirited,I do not understand hateful comedy. And I do not understand why people enjoy such mean-spiritedness. Watching this film was not an enjoyable experience at all.
4,Almost Perfect product,I purchased this heater for an island camp that does not have reliable electrical service and to which propane must be carried by hand. Thus high efficiency and reliability is a must. The delivery was fast and heater arrived in good shape. Installation was straight forward. Instructions were fairly clear if you take the time to read them several times carefully. The only drawback I have found is that the tray designed to catch incandescent particles that may fall from the burner seems to have been improperly designed with regard to the supply and output lines the enter and exit the bottom the unit. I have simply positioned a cookie sheet under the unto to serve the same peurpose. No big deal The unit fired right up and has been working reliably since installation.
1,Wow it broke in a hurry,This item started out great guns. Ran swell for about two weeks and then stopped producing hot water. Fire stills builds but none comes out the hot water line. Been unable to reach anyone and really need to get this thing fixed or replaced. Any ideas?
1,expensive because of replacment parts,Going one 3 years now and yet again another part has broken!I have had to replace the hydro generator the pilot gas limiter and the main limiter. This has been a waste of money. I have now spent more on this water heater than a more expensive reliable unit.I am going to get rid of this pos POS and get a better one.Do not but this water heater unless you got losts of money and don't mind cold showers.
4,Engaging,"The Wall Street Journal book review of December 18, 2010 in an article titled ""Rewriting Her Legacy"" stated the following:""It's hard to imagine that there's more to say about the extraordinary life of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, but it turns out that there is: Two dueling books tell the story of the last third of her life spent as a literary editor in New York, with JFK and Ari just ghostly presences in the background.William Kuhn's ""Reading Jackie"" and Greg Lawrence's ""Jackie as Editor"" are seemingly the same book--chronological accounts of her 19-year career at the publishers Viking and Doubleday--but they are actually very different.""I, however, believe that K.L. Kelleher's book ""Jackie: Beyond the Myth of Camelot, A Passion for Artists & Authors"", which appeared on the market 11 years ago, is well written, researched, insightful, engaging and certainly worth reading! Kelleher's book is a bye product of her PBS documentary, with the same name, which debuted on November 29th, 1999."
1,Not the best bio of Jackie....,"I found that this book was poorly written-- some of the information might be useful, but it really isn't a good resource if you're looking for a general biography of Jackie. I think Sarah Bradford's biography, America's Queen, is a thousand times better than this book!"
2,Poorly Written But Contains Valuable Information,"This book is poorly written and riddled with inaccuracies (though harmless ones, such as that JFK taught Caroline the poem ""Fig"" when she herself has stated that her mother taught it to her to recite to her father); however, it contains valuable information about Jackie's years as an editor. It is too bad that this book did not have a decent editor. The author wanders far far afield repeatedly wasting pages on too much detail about such things as Viet Nam and the bossa nova...when a few paragraphs would have sufficed (the book is about Jackie, remember?). I was truly surprised that other readers were not more critical. Actually one might do better to skip the book and view the video of the same name."
2,"""The Lady or the Tiger?"" Which door did she choose?","In ""The Lady or the Tiger,"" Frank Stockton intended to make readers believe that the princess chose the door with the tiger behind it because she seemed like the type of person who would rather see her lover die than marry another woman. After all, she is semi-barbarian. Maybe if she weren't semi-barbarian, she'd choose the door with the lady whom she hated behind it. She chose the tiger's door because she was jealous. She saw her lover and the woman speaking and trading glances, which obviously creates jealousy. Ultimately, jealousy makes everyone seek revenge, which is why the princess chose the tiger as her lover and the woman's punishment. This short-story was a good read. However, the movie that compliments the story is absolutely horrible. I wouldn't recommend it. Which door would you have chosen: the lady or the tiger?"
2,"There is more than one Cell Guard, and this isn't the right one.","I purchased this because I thought it might be equivalent to Biotech CellGuard Plus, which is a wonderful product. There was virtually no discernable benefit from this stuff."
5,The German Dances,"I bought this CD for the German Dances, several of which I play myself. To hear Brendel play them is a joy. His talent obscures the complexity of the pieces. A must have if you are a Schubert or a Brendel fan."
3,somewhat dated,"Good but somewhat dated. Ironically, also, the much thicker masterpiece, Don't Get Taken Every Time, is older but better. It has, however, been updated as of 2007"
2,way too much money for quality,"I purchased this for my daughter who loves strawberry shortcake thinking not only would this help teach her some dance steps, but she could do it along with strawberry shortcake and to her music. WRONG! When I tested this, I was highly dissappointed with the graphics...lousy. Music? It doesn't play much (and no full songs only clips). THe sound is also lousy. It's like a video game shooting arrows all over the screen that you're suppose to follow with your feet. Very confusing (if it's confusing to me my daughter will definitely be confused). Strawberry doesn't dance to any of it.I was upset to see the return policy. Since I got free shipping on this, not only would I have to pay for shipping to return a lousy product, but I'd have to pay for the ""free"" shipping. It would cost me 1/2 of the amount of the product just to return so I guess I'm stuck with it. I only hope my daughter can get something out of it. I wouldn't recommend. It's not worth the money at all."
3,"It was OK, but broke very quickly","I bought this for my daughter as an Xmas gift.The graphics were very poor quality, although it was fun for her.the music was good for the most part, very cutesy and appropriate.I do think that the age range for which it is recommended should be knocked down a little bit.My daughter is 7 and I think she's a little beyond it.Although she did have fun with it, unfortunately the game broke after just being used about 5 times.We went to plug it into the TV and for some reason it wouldn't function. ALl the graphics were just scrambled and frozen, and it hasn't worked since."
4,Not bad for the price.,"I got this for my 5 year old daughter and I immediately understood what people were saying about the difficulty level. She could not do all four step directions at once (forward, back, left and right steps) and was getting frustrated. I offered to to three of the directions so she could concentrate on just one at a time. (she chose left step) It was a fun way to play together and soon she was asking to take over more and more directions. After playing like this together for a day or so, she was playing the easiest levels by herself and doing quite well. I still wish the game offered even easier levels but if the parent plays with the child, I think the child can pick up the coordination in an hour or two.It is remarkable that this game is as inexpensive as it is. The graphics and music are not very sophisticated but for less than $15, it is worth every penny."
5,Better for older kids,"My 7 1/2 year old bought this with a gift card. I discouraged her because it said it was for age 4 and up and I thought she was too old for Strawberry Shortcake. She just loves it. It is still difficult for her, but she is getting the hang of it and all of her 1st grade friends love it too. The babysitters really enjoy it too. There is no way she could have done this at 4. I would not buy this for kids younger than 6. You will be disappointed. Buy the younger kids the Smart Cycle. It is a blast and they get some exercise!!"
4,My little girls love it!,"My little girls (ages 4, 7 and 9) think this is soooo much fun. It's a little hard for the 4 year old, but she doesn't know she's not doing it ""perfectly."" She loves it. I like that they are getting a little exercise indoors (since there's a foot of snow outside), and learning better rhythm and coordination. They play with our big-screen TV so I think the graphics are a little simplistic and the music pretty ""digital sounding"", but the girls don't seem to mind at all. Very fun game. I'm glad we bought it!"
4,Five Year Old,My five year old enjoys being able to play a DDR game more her age. Older siblings have the original DDR games and she always felt left out... she now feels great
2,Very Old School,"I was pretty disappointed when I hooked up this dance mat to my TV. In this day and age, the graphics in this game are ridiculous. My kids have never seen graphics like that and don't even understand how to get the dance mat to work. This mat is more like something I would have had when I was a kid! My girls are 3 and 6 an I don't think I have seen them play with this once. I even have it all set to go right in front of their TV. I tried it out once and it was kind of fun, but like I said, the technology of it is ridiculous. Maybe this is the original that the tried to market back in 1982 and they put it in a new box to try and re-sell it. I would not recommend this and I wish I didn't buy it!"
1,Pretty poor quality and experience,Lousy graphics... I mean even worse than what I expected... and I didn't expect much.Game play is poor at best. My daughter actually tried a couple times to play it and it just didn't work mostly and wasn't fun even when it kind of worked.Waste of money.
1,Too difficult ... made my child cry!,"My 5 year old tried so hard to play with this for 20 min! Its extremely difficult (goes very fast, even on ""beginner"" setting). The poor kid ended up running out of the room in tears, pleading ""Mom, please make Santa take this back!"""
2,Not for toddlers under 2,My 15 month old loves Elmo. This DVD however had too much talking and conversation and he was quickly bored. He didn't seem too fond of Elmo's daddy either. His appearance should have been as friendly as Elmo only bigger and with glasses maybe. Those eyebrows and unfriendly voice kept my son very far from the TV set! lol
3,Bedtime with Elmo dvd,"Cute movie until the 3rd ""story"", which was a little too scary for my 2-3/4 year old granddaughter. The characters started talking about being scared of monsters and the dark.....time to turn it off! said my granddaughter.May be better for 4 and 5 year olds."
1,Only buy if you want your little one to be afraid of monsters and the dark!!!,"Until watching this video my son thought monsters were all good and friendly, like Elmo and Grover. That was until Ernie starts talking about being afraid of monsters and the dark. For days now all our son keeps saying is that he is afraid of monsters and the dark. WHY would Sesame Street introduce the concept of being afraid of monsters and dark?????? This make me very angry and has now affected our son. We love Sesame Street, and have every elmo DVD available, but this one should be changed. It is just not healthy for kids with the introduction of fear! Only buy this video if you want your child afraid of monsters and the dark. Awful!!!"
5,great,Our 12 month old loves best of Elmo 1 & 2 and he loved this one too. He usually loses interest if there is A Mr noodle part but this movie doesnt have that. It's perfect
1,poor choice of video,"I wish I had read these reviews before buying this DVD at a local store. I had to turn it off because of the focus on scary things at night. My child is not fearful, just misses her crib. Hopefully she will not be fearful after watching this. I was looking for a nice fun relaxing time with Elmo to help cast a positive light on bed time and the big bed. This was NOT it. I will stick with bedtime stories and ditch this DVD."
4,Just one thing,Love the watch but the clasp broke within the first month. I think it was pretty rare thing because I abuse my watches. At least it stayed on. Would have been a bummer to lose the whole watch over the side of a boat.
3,Too small,"Yes, the watch glows nicely in the dark. But, the watch face itself is hard to see in the daylight -- the digits and numbers are very small.I returned it."
3,Budget Tritium Watch,"Like other Type 3 owners, I was attracted to this watch for it's advertised value for money.The Tritium illumination is bright in low light settings which makes telling the time in complete darkness a breeze.Unfortunately, I can only give it 3 stars for the following reasons:Strap lasted about 2 weeks - replaced it with a rubber strap.Face scratches very easily - spend a little more and get sapphire rather than mineral.Do not get this watch wet, it will end up with condensation inside - buy a watch with a screw down crown.I spend much of my time working on or around water, but my Traser stays at home for fear of drowning.Final word - my watch still works after 6 months of everyday use, but if I could have a do-over, I'd save up my pennies for a sturdier more waterproof Traser watch.Cheers"
1,Dont read if you are very ill,This book may help people with mild depression but for severe depression with suicidal thoughts I would avoid. Some of the patronising suggestions are enough to tip you over the edge. :O)
2,Cheap,"I bought this item for my Husband as a Christmas gift; and this is what he thinks of it.From the 1st time use to the 15th time, it takes too long to shave, it feels like I have razor burn after every shave. Facial hair comes back ALOT quicker, about 8 hours and it's like I haven't shaved that day. I would not recommend this product to my friends."
1,Worst shaver... ever.,It didn't give me a close shave. It leaked profusely. And eventually it just plain broke. Save your money and wait til Norelco comes out with a self-cleaning razor.
2,I wanted to like it but...,"I used this shaver every day for the full 30 day trial period and found that it still required a lot of effort to get a decent shave. Achieving a close-enough shave required applying more pressure which in turn caused irritation. Even on the thirtieth day, the shave took seven minutes. I then passed over my face lightly with my old Remington Intercept and took off a significant amount of hair!.I thought the self-cleaning would be a great time-saving feature but with my old Intercept I could shave and clean up in half the time of just shaving with the 9500.I didn't realize just how much damage I was doing to my face until I splashed on aftershave -- major burning with the 9500, none with the Intercept."
5,Need an easy shaver that cleans itself?,This shaver works like a charm. I have had mine for almost 2 years now while mine does need new blades it gave a little over a year on the first set of blades before needing to replace them. Which is really good compared to others I have tried.The fact that it cleans itself is awesome. I havn't used any others but I cant complain really about this one. The LCD read out on the time isn't always correct but its usually fairly close. The charge time is great also. I do highly recommend this if your looking to get a really good abit expensive razor it is worth it though.
1,One year later... garbage,"Pros:1) Rechargeable and could last for 30 minutes.Cons:1) Self cleaning is a joke. You must keep ""fluid"" in the shaver mount. The fluid becomes filled with ""shaving by-products"" and their bacteria. The ""fluid"" as a result becomes a ""soup"" which cakes up the internal components of the pumping mechanisms. After a year, no amount of cleaning can keep this system working efficiently.2) The shaver itself is not ""a close shave"". A cheap $20 did a much better job.3) The shaver has a noticeable reduced power after 10 minutes. I would not take this on the road.4) Due to the ""self-cleaning"", the shaver is hard to clean manually."
2,Cleaning system failed,"Been using this product since 4/2006. However a the cleaning system has a very difficult time keeping the product clean, then after 1 1/2 years just died. Why -> internal contacts had corroded due to rust and pieces had broken off."
2,cleaning unit is not durable,"There's nothing really wrong with the razor itself. The problem I've found is that the cleaning unit is shoddy and always fails (in various ways) long before the razor does. Thus you will end up buying full, expensive replacements often, including a new razor that you don't need -- or else, you'll end up tossing the cleaning unit and continuing to use the razor and clean it by hand, which is what I finally did.The cleaning unit is convenient while it works, but it just doesn't last."
1,"Nice concept, poor execution","The Remington R-9500 promises a self-cleaning feature using exclusive Remington cleaning fluid which needs to be replaced every month. This incurs an additional monthly cost of around $5. With the fluid comes a new filter. The filter does a good job catching the shaved stubble and must be replaced with the fluid.A major problem in the design is the impeller shaft that pumps the cleaning fluid from the reservoir to the cleaning area. I've had to replace the entire cleaning base three times because the impeller shaft becomes rusty and breaks off, rendering the cleaning feature unuseable.Gunk tends to build up in the shaving head and this needs to be disassembled regularly and cleaned by hand. If the self-cleaning feature worked as advertised, this shouldn't be necessary.I would not recommend buying this product."
3,great shaver but bad Cleaning System,I have had this razor for 6 months now and it works great but just after 2 months my Cleaning/Charging system broke and leaked the oil all over by bedroom. If it wasnt for the crappy cleaner I would rate this razor 4 stars but it only gets a 3.
3,Rotary Razor,It is NOT a Norelco!! Heavy duty motor. It takes a couple layers of your skin off at first. No height adjustment lowers my opinion of this razor.The cleaning system is nice and works pretty good.
2,Poor Design,"The shave is not nearly as close as their competitor's with very similar design, and it does leave more of a burn than the competitor. I had one of these for 20 months, and had to have the cleaning system replaced 4 times under warranty! The pump just quits and the system doesn't work after 5 or 6 months. The last time, they replaced the entire thing, including the shaver, with a new (more expensive) model R-1000. They don't seem to have learned anything from the previous design, and the angle of the head on this new one makes it nearly impossible to use. The switch is located right where my thumb rests, so I inadvertently turn it off frequently in mid-shave. I'm going back to the other guys!"
5,Great razor !,"This is a great razor...easily the best shave I have ever had.I had a Norelco, but this is a much better shave, and very solidly built. I love the self-cleaning feature."
5,An outstanding shaver,"This is by far the best electric shaver I have ever used. If you use it as directed (not pressing it too hard into your skin), there is no way it can cut you or even irritate. I have sensitive skin, yet I can use this without any pre-shave products. The self-cleaning feature is outstanding as well. The shave I get is also much closer than with any other electric shaver I ever used-- I used to avoid electric shavers because they always left me with stubble; this one doesn't. If you're looking for a premium shaver, get this one."
2,"Save your money, use a wet razor","I bought this shaver about a month ago. I been using it fairly regularly to let my face get used to it. After that month I still get massive razor burn from it. It takes me at least 7 minutes to get a decently close shave with it and by 5PM I got shadow all over. I can do a better job with my Gillete Atra in half the time. I have tried pre electric shave lotions and after shave lotion but nothing helps, my face still gets red with razor burn. What is also bad is that the cleaning solution only lasts about 4 weeks and when I tried to order it from Remington directly they said there was a 3 week backorder wait time, they were out. No store seems to carry the cleaning solution at this time either. I guess if you have to have it, get it, but I prefer my old wet razor."
3,Remington Rotary Shaver,"Not so great. I Thought as a Remington it would shave great. But I have not found a rotary shaver that shaves very well. Convenient and easy, but not very good. Plus the cleaning system broke in a few months and could not be replaced or repaired, so now I have to clean it manually with water. The shaver itself is solid and strong, but shaves no better than any other rotary I have used.Stick to the Remington Micro-screen. Best electric shave I have found.Not happy about the ""Made in China"" label either."
2,"Decent shaver, poorly designed cleaning base, good customer service",I purchased this for my husband 2 and a half years ago. HE changed the solution and filter regularly. There is a clamp on the pump that starts rusting pretty quickly. Why the design was not updated to a stainless steel clamp is beyond me. The base was replaced after a few months when we noticed the problem with the rust. Customer support was great. The entire system was replaced when the rust got really bad again and we suspected it was affecting the shaver head. The third base quit working a couple months ago. My husband has been cleaning it by hand since. We're surprising him with a new Norelco 8245 XLD for father's day. Another note - In the last year I was only able to find the solution on Amazon.
1,Garbage,"We are on the second cleaning stand and it's trashed now too. It's been less than a year, don't waste your money."
2,only half a biography,"I read this book because I was interested in learning about Shirley's political and ambasodorial roles. I read the entire book only to find the story finishing in 1954. The notes at the end said that shirley was working on the second instalment of her biography, and seeing as that was in 1988, I can only guess that she would have completed it by now - but it appears never have made it to publication. I was very disappointed that the biography only covered her life as a childhood star and then as a wife and mother. So I would hesitate to recommend the book as it is only half a biography, and would suit fans of the silver screen only."
4,A Bit Overkill Maybe?,"I almost felt silly buying this tool. I really only needed a good, solid putty knife to unstick the painted over windows. But it wasn't expensive and looked pretty solid. It is! Like the metal base--can hammer on it no prob. Solid, comfy grip.I would have given it five stars despite the overkill-ness, but there is a design flaw in the screwdriver jobby on the bottom. It keeps popping out when I don't want it to. Not a big deal, but it is annoying, especially since it is superfluous anyways."
5,great tool!!,I love this tool. So handy when painting or doing other home improvement projects. Very sharp and strong!
2,Too much = too many broken things,"Pros:- Build quality feels sturdy- Nice edgesCons:- Screw Driver flip was broken on Day one- Now I cant close the screw driver part and makes it dangerous to use.So dissapointed that this tool is broken due to the Flip Screw driver at the handle it. The screw driver does not close and it is annoying and makes using the tool almost useless. When I have a free weekend I am going to try and remove it and the tool will actually be quite nice. Probably is it looks pretty hard to remove.I would buy the tool again if it didnt have the flip screw driver. Even if i got another one that worked, you can see the way it is designed is that it will fail sometime in the future.Too bad, the construction of the rest of the tool is very nice."
1,Cover DOES NOT fit the V3i - Only fits the V3 and the V3e,The advertisement is wrong. This product won't fit the V3i as that cover is longer than the regular V3 or V3e. The sellar should have known this fact as all the other dealers admonish.
2,wrong advertising,"It's ok for V3, but battery cover will not fit V3i, battery cover for V3i is longer due to its external memory flash. Use it for V3 only."
5,Breathtaking,"I love this type of DVD; original, thoughtful, beautifully executed. The music, rarely heard, is wonderful. The playing is of the highest quality. Lisitsa tosses off these difficult works like they were child's play. I highly recommend this DVD."
5,An Amazing Performance Beautifully Presented,"Ukrainian-born pianist Valentina Lisitsa has released three DVDs and all of them set the standard for performances on the piano. This production of Schwanengesang is beautifully lighted and filmed.Lisitsa plays like an angel. Her hands move so fast they are nearly a blur and her fingers seem to barely touch the keys.She now lives in rural North Carolina and calls herself a ""redneck pianist"". According to her website, her next recording project is the 32 Beethoven sonatas. Sign me up."
3,This is OK...,"This storybook bible is OK. Certainly not great and certainly not one I would recommend. It's shallow and there are several inaccuracies. One off-hand I'll mention: It took Noah many, many YEARS to build the Ark not mere months (p. 30). Also, many stories have been omitted. A better choice for this age group would be ""The Big Picture Story Bible""."
1,Missed the point,"I found the stories to be so abridged and ""re-formed"" that they often miss the point of the original biblical passages. For example, ""am I my bother's keeper"" is not only key to the Christian ethic, but also a key part of interpreting aspects of Western religious literature. However it is cleansed from the story, as is the satanic nature of the snake in the Garden of Eden, etc.I will go on searching for something that better depicts the intention of the biblical stories and go back to telling the stories by interpreting them on-the-fly from the ""original""!"
5,Accurate Stories great illustrations,This book has very accurate stories and very nice illustrations. I have only found a few places where I have had to add to or change up the story slightly for my child to get the full picture. I have looked at a number of 4-8 year old Bible story books and this is by far the best.Highly recommend!
3,Good for smaller kids,"I purchased this so my younger kids could use a dance pad while the older kids used the PS2/XBOX one. The little kids love it. I even have had fun with it. The songs get boring for me, but the little ones don't seem to mind."
2,Disney Dance Dance Revolution,The dance pad is not very responsive and frustrates the kids when they play it
1,Broken,After I bought this & set it up I found out that the batteries it came with were dead. When I tried it with my batteries it would only turn on to a jumbled screen. It's too bad because my kids were super excited to play it. Plus the place we bought it from doesn't take returns. What a waste of money.
3,Not Exactly What I Expected,The graphics and sound quality were not near what I expected based on today's technology. Felt more like Atari of years ago. Was the right size and speed for my son to use however and he does enjoy playing it.
3,lots of fun for kids,"Lots of fun for kids. Not as big as the original so harder for adults to play, and the kids will want you to play!"
3,It;s fine for a start,"I have young kids and they like the challenge of this. I use it for exercise and can get my heartrate going with it. I don't think it's the greatest quality and the spaces are too close together for an adult. This is a good product to use as a test as to whether you would like to own the real version. After doing this a few times, I know that I would like a playstation next year, but I don't regret buying this in the meantime. It gets lots of use in our house"
1,this is the worst plug n play ever,i thought this would be easy for my 7 yr old so i got her this for christmas she couldnt figure out how to get it so easy or how to dance right without adult help and even we as adults had a very hard tme i guess when u step it doesnt recognize it every time and so u lose all the time very frustrating and withing 2 months it broke wont show anything on tv when u turn it on it just makes a funny noise what a piece of crap
3,Ignore the one-star witlings,"This is a good effort by a writer who understands the subtleties of the characters involved. While some of us may be naive enough to proclaim what a fictional character can and cannot do, Rucka has the maturity and intelligence to realize that the viewpoint of an Amazon warrior is not guided by a ""Super Friends"" mentality. His stories also display a nice tendency to allow the characters to explain their own actions if you have the patience to allow them to develop."
4,Good stuff - rave reviews on my pie crust from guests,"I find this tool extremely handy for creating a lattice pie crust. It was simple to use, though it required a little extra effort to cut out the pie crust as required, it being plastic and all. Nevertheless, the final result was very good and I had my guests asking me how I got the design on to the crust."
3,It's just okay - I probably wouldn't purchase again though.,"The other reviewers who indicated that this cutter doesn't cut the crust as it appears in the picture are absolutely correct. It actually cuts the outside edge of each ""J"" only. You will need to cut the inside edge of the cutout in order for the pie top to look like it does in the picture. It's okay but not like described."
2,review,don't really care for this pie cutter; I don't like the end result and hate that i need more words for this review
5,beautiful pie crusts,I am so glad I bought this pie crust cutter. My pies look a lot more professional now. It is so easy to use.
1,Easier to make the dough strips than use this device,"I used this for the first time and would not use it again. The design came out fine, but it took way too long to punch out all the little holes."
2,What a mess!,"I love to bake pies in the fall and thought this would be great for an apple pie. However, the pattern is so intericate that it is hard to punch out all of the apples, and when you do, it rips the dough. You also can't see the little stems on the apple. As the pie backs, you lose alot of the design. I have returned this product, since the pie did not come out pretty in the end. I will go back to making my lattice pies by hand."
1,Really offensive,"Book has several errors. Frustrating that Winch fails to grasp the fear, shame and isolation of the Clamorgan family and I suspect most the ""Aristorcracy"" especially after the Civil War.Great-niece of Cypian Clamorgan"
1,"Too much pitch, not enough kitsch","Blech - the video looks like it was mastered from VHS source material and looks dreadful. While no video drop outs or other source flaws, the colors are washed out and the video is grainy.But enough of the A/V quality. I find the content to be lacking - too much sales pitch, not enough personality and flavor. It's a soulless overview of the road trips in question, and tries to cram way too much into each segment. While I wouldn't expect each state to get a huge documentary, the segments are way too short and are way too rapid fire.Honestly, I would much rather save my 20 bucks and get the Rare Visions & Roadside Revelations DVD boxed set from the PBS station in Kansas: KCPT"
2,Road trips,"I am always watching for a good road trip on DVD. The ""America's Great Road Trips and Scenic Drives"" sounded like it had potential. I didn't expect a lot of time to be spent at each stop because there were so many places of interest listed, but I did expect great photography and it wasn't. They tried to make the southwest look as green as the northeast. The rest of the country covered was green, green, green. The over saturation of colors was sometimes nauseating. It completely ruined the visual enjoyment, greens, blues, reds, oranges, purples, etc. were too intense. I live in the southwest and love the subtly of the natural earthan colors. Besides the poor photography the narrator seemed to be frantically searching through a thesarus for desciptive words. The content was fine for what this DVD promises, but is greatly harmed visually by the saturated colors, thus the two stars. I wish they would redo these DVDs in the ""Natural"" colors of the region."
3,A Start,"I found this book to be sound biblically and an easy read ... but I would consider it more an overview and introduction to dealing with loneliness ... the book did not seem to go deep enough for those who have suffered intensely with loneliness over their lifetime ... perhaps I misinterpreted the purpose of the book ... bottom line, perhaps a good place to start but those who struggle greatly with this issue will need a deeper dive ..."
3,OK but not stellar,"Bought this, Mel Bay's book for the Chromatic harmonica and the ""Harmonica for Dummies""book. Of the three, the Dummies book is by far the most comprehensive and informative for the novice player even though it is not designed for the chromatic harmonica. I found the Mel Bay book very disappointing. This one seemed to be in the middle. It seems OK but not inspired and left me as a novice wanting more information."
4,Skywatchers of Ancient Mexico,"Great book for Astronomy history buffs. The Mayans were some of the great astronomers of the past and this book details the methods and briefs. While the book leans to the textbook side, thus the 4 rating rather than a 5 star, it is very readable. I liked the decoding of the Mayan Gliffs. The book shows numerous gliffs and provides written intreputations. A Mayan astronomer, for example, is shown sitting with his eye reaching out and grasping a star. The book also details the Mayan calendar and how they determined rather precisely the orbital period of Venus and other heavenly bodies.The book is great for anyone wanting a better understanding of anicent astronomical methods and a further understanding of the Mayan people."
2,Typical 1944-46 Universal serial,"Lost City was close to being Universal's last serial effort. It is not as dull as some of their other serial efforts but it is not very good either. Very noticeable is Universal's penchant for saving money by framing their serial plots around available stock shots. In Lost City the cliffhangers for chapters 2,3 and 4 were lifted from the 1943 Maria Montez-Jon Hall epic White Savage and many more ""liftings"" are prevelant in other chapters. If you want an exotic serial go with ""Drums of Fu Manchu"", one of Republic's finest."
3,Prehistoric Indiana Jones,"I'm just quoting reviewers who see this serial as the precursor to Indiana Jones. Except for pleasant childhood memories of Flash Gordon, I'm usually bored with serials. The repetitive nature and exposition of serials is unintentionally funny though eventually a drag. Still, Lost City has some exciting, exotic locals and has that ""Star Wars"" credits and text that travels up the screen. And it stars Lionel Atwill, Key Luke, Jane Addams!Also it fully exemplifies what the TV show ""Batman"" was making fun of(and hence why Indiana Jones is ridiculous). I'm not a historian of serials, but if you want to watch or own only one, I recommend this one."
3,cute but just okay,"Cute idea. The sippy cup doesn't fit the rock a bye chou chou mouth, you have to cram it in to get the doll to make the sucking sound. The cup also has a plastic wrap-on design instead of it painted on the cup itself. My 21 mo old daughter ripped it almost completely off as soon as she realized it was not painted on. The paint on the spout of the sippy cup has rubbed off too, but then again that may be due to children putting it in their own mouths. It's still a cute idea and maybe it would be better for the baby chou chou's that are not functioning dolls. The bowl and spoon are around here somewhere but for some reason they lost interest in that pretty quickly. My girls didn't really play very much with the bowl and spoon but from time to time they will put the bib on and use the sippy cup."
3,time to feed my baby!,I use to get this for christmas and my baby kayla (My rock a bye chou chou doll a girl)use to eat this food since she's 1 month old. but i think is a great toy! You rok rock a bye CHOU CHOU!
3,not impressed,"I was not impressed with this toy. It was cute but my daughter played with it for all of 5 minutes and never played with it again. It doesn't seem to catch her interest, she prefers the baby annabell items."
2,"Good enough trimmer, but vacuum is only a gimmick","This trimmer seems sturdy and well built, but I, like most folks, bought this because of the vacuum feature. I would estimate that the vacuum picks up about 70% of the clippings, so I'm not sure it is worth the noise (and it is noisy). I found this to be true regardless of how big the trim job. Also, when this trimmer goes dead, it goes dead fast. My old trimmer would slow down when the batteries needed charging, leaving me with some wiggle room to finish up my trim. With this trimmer, you can end up half trimmed and waiting for a recharge (a great complication on the day of a job interview). I got the trimmer REAL cheap on ebay so I'm somewhat satisfied, but I wouldn't pay more than $25 for this trimmer."
3,"Good for some trimming, but you better have another","I was attracted to this trimmer due to the built-in vacuum-- the idea was, light grooming AFTER I'd been out of the shower a while, and the ability to do a touch-up without getting hair on my clothes or the sink. Well, it's not TOO bad for that, but in actuality only gets maybe 95% of the hair, and that is dependent on how you position the unit.It was a good thing that I still had my dependable Remington MB40... it is really a better unit for more heavy duty trimming IMHO. Also, you really can't trim nose hair or inside ear hair (hey, that's what happens when you get old) due to the way the blades are positioned--- but I can with the old MB40.I'll recommend it for the light trimming chores, but not for all-around use. It's not versatile enough."
2,Remington Vacuum Really Sucks!!! BAD!!!!,"I gave it two stars because on the cheeks and neck it works pretty good. On the curves of the face it really doesn't work that great. The vacuum picks up bout 75% of the hair and the vacuum slot gets in the way when you take the gaurd off to edge your beard and around tour ears and neck. You really can't see what you are trimming. That becomes a big problem. I had a two year old Norelco that worked great, but the battery only lasted 22 months, so I got mad when it would't work anymore and decided on the Remington MB-70. I wish I would of went back and bought another Norelco with the precision cutting system because it worked better than the Remington. The Remington MB-70 needs to be recharged when the battery goes down. You can't use the cord when shaving. That can be a big problem when the battery runs down and you have half a face to shave. The price is good, but you might want to spend alittle more and get a better beard trimmer."
1,Vacuum poor; drugstore.com won't take it back,"I tried this once before going back to my regular Norelco trimmer. It feels cumbersome to hold and doesn't vacuum very well. To top it off, DRUGSTORE.COM wouldn't let me return it since it was 34 days after it was purchased (it was a birthday present) and they only let you return an item within 30 days! I sent it back anyway but couldn't get any credit even with a UPS confirmation number. Steer clear of this shaver and buy a different shaver locally where you can return it if you don't like it!"
2,Very disappointing,"My old Norelco trimmer finally died so my wife gave me this trimmer as a Christmas gift. Fortunately she kept the receipt, because it's going back. The vacuum feature is pretty much useless aside from whirring a lot. The intake is a gaping slot behind the trimmer blades, but the suction there is negligable. If my face was a perfectly vertical plane and all my whiskers were at 90-degree angles then this arrangement might almost work. As it is, it doesn't. Between the odd angle of the slot and the air blowing from the fan at the bottom it seems to toss stuff around even more than my old trimmer. I guess I'll try Norelco's vacuum model."
2,Not worth the hype,This is a very noisy trimmer. It is esthetically pleasing but not the best ergonomics. The vacuum does little work you still have to clean your sink after. Detailing is not clean as the blade does not cut very close.I was disappointed.
4,DIVE BVI,"It is always good to read a novel which is set in a place with which you can identify. Tortola is my second home, a place to which I plan to retire sooner rather than later. Since my first read by this author (UNDER PRESSURE) some years ago, I was delighted to obtain another one (DARK WATER DIVE) and I was not disappointed with it. The story is interesting and, having had the opportunity to dive - only once - I can learn from and understand the situations in which Hannah finds herself. I expect that just as Dick Francis helps the average person to understand and feel a part of the horse-racing environment with his thrillers, Kathy Brandt might do so in a diving context. I have just finished SWIMMING WITH THE DEAD and I look forward to reading DANGEROUS DEPTHS. For a pleasing reading experience, I have no hesitation in recommending Kathy Brandt's BVI-based diving novels of which DARK WATER DIVE seems typical."
3,You Had to Be There,This book is a must read for anyone who loves the British Virgin Islands. It goes very fast. The entire time you are reading your mind is actually in the islands. All the scenery is totally familiar and for a period of time you are enjoying your last vacation again.
4,dark water dive,"very good, the series is one you can't put down. I am looking forward to the next book, can't wait."
4,"Fast Moving, Interesting Plots","This is the second book in the series, and I enjoyed it as much as the first. I did figure out the ""mystery"" before Hannah did, which wouldn't be very likely in real life....I'm sure a police detective would have gone down the same road I did. It didn't keep me from enjoying the book, as it is well written and moves right along. I also recommend the Seychelle Sullivan mysteries if you enjoy this one. Just light escapism without extreme violence or detailed sex scenes."
4,"Great concepts, kind of long","This is a great little workbook for anyone interested in learning ancient number systems. My students especially liked the Greek and Egyptian number systems.However, for classroom use, this is kind of long. I will definitely not require some pages for my students next year."
1,Kid's Review,It's impossible to get trough a level and the quality is lame. This is one of the worst games in the world.
3,Oldie but goodie!,"This is an old book as stated below, but I originally bought it in the 1980's for help on my Buick even-fire 3.2 V-6. It proved very helpful there, and the section on Ford's 60 degree V-6 is the largest in the book. The Chevy section is very sparse, so look elsewhere if you need help on one of those engines. GM used to put out a Power Manual on Chevys that was available at any dealership's part's department that had a great deal of info on the Chevy V-6's. You might check and see if they still carry this if you need more information on the Chevy V-6's. It should prove very up to date if they do.--Bobby Jr"
1,VERY OUT OF DATE,"This book is VERY out of date (1986). The text states ""Virtually no aftermarket bolt-on performance pieces currently exist for this new engine..."" This is simply not true today. There are numerous bolt-on products available through mail order, local area shops and dozens of web sites devoted entirely to this particular engine and its applications.Also, the section on the Chevy 60o 2.8L (the reason I bought the book) is only 17 pages!My recommendation would be to save the money you would spend on this book and apply it to the performance parts that really are out there. Surfing the web produced LOTS of links and more information than this book."
2,Great value...poor quality,"The grill box fits with the stand for the EZ Grill burner stand or the Camp Chef Ultimate Sportsman. The features are definitely on target - the problem is the chosen materials. Despite aggressive cleaning and maintenance, it just wouldn't hold up. The cast iron grids held up nicely - cast iron always does - but the black metal body didn't. Rust appeared after the first cleaning and no high temp paint or food oil wipe could save it. If they made this same product in 100% stainless, they'd have the the perfect grill... but they don't. I recommend another product such as the Sportsman's Series Camping Portable LP Gas Grill - which s almost entirely stainless."
2,"Works for now, but rusting through on the bottom","This is a rather cheap unit. Yes, it works. You must constantly reapply conditioner to the cast iron, that's the easy part. The worst part for me is , after 9 month's of use, the thin drip bottom of the BBQ box is flaking away with rust. Apparently it was only cheaply painted steel, not porcelain like it should be to withstand the heat and drippings of meat. I don't expect it to last more than a season or two. I expect more from a BBQ box than this.I have yet to contact Camp Chef to see what they'll do, I'm hoping they will offer a solution."
3,Bad design,"Very disappointed with grill box. The heat deflector is cheaply made and I had a real problem with flare-ups. I modified the box by adding a perforated stainless steel plate below the grate and it helps. This box needs a complete re-design. When the heat deflector rusts out I'm going to fit it with a ""flavor bar"" design like Weber grill uses."
2,Definitely rusts out pretty quickly,I use this for both home use and some commercial work. Has performed quite well but it definitely has more than it's fair share of rust. Every time I move it there is rust all over the place. Sure wish it was better quality because it's very portable.
3,A Bit Disappointing,"I selected this book expecting to read about the trials and tribulations of living in the wilds of Alaska. Unfortunately, very little time is spent covering the outback lifestyle. Instead, Natalie's accident, her recovery, her relationship with her parents, etc take up the bulk of the narrative. It's a pleasant enough story, but I don't think it delivered on the promised concept."
1,Rancho Mirage,"Read more like fiction . Did not hold my interest. Very boring. I may request a refund, it is not worth the amount I paid for this story."
3,Had a hard time staying awake,"Usually I can bang out a book of this length in a day, but not this one.I had a difficult time staying awake, & it was missing something. I just seemed ""dry."""
5,Thinking and speaking,"For Derek Pinkerton, thinking and speakink are two points of view for the same artifact.In addition, his humor redeems my lack of knowledge of English."
5,Fate is Unkind,"The young woman, Jessica Alexander was worried about starting a relationship with her ex-lover, Jack and in particular she felt she had suffered enough for once!Was this young woman `making a mistake,' because she didn't trust? Was she just stuck-up? Of course not - it was simply that she never took the opportunity to look further or check out the facts. She would have probably saved many years of heartache and been much happier. `How long did she wait?'In a moment an innocent man should be considered a cheat! But if you want to know what Jessica believes and decides, and what happens to the rest of the family and friends who believe that Fate is unkind, you will have to read the book! It's the kind of story that keeps you turning pages."
5,kingston is the new king,this mp3 player is the best it plays videos games every thing and the best thing about it is the price its only 150 dollers if u dont have this mp3 player u r weird.:-)
4,Game,Was requested as a gift item. Great play on Monopoly. Nice to see a different version with my favorite team.
2,10 inch,This drum head is very thin and dents easily. I have a feeling it will break very quickly. It also has too much echo and takes a lot of dampening pads to fix it. I got these heads extremely cheap so I can't complain I got what I paid for. As soon as I can I will change both of my 10 inch heads to response 2 heads. I bought those for all the rest of my drums now and they are great.
4,great,this book was great. All of this Author's books keep you going. I think you would enjoy it also if you read it.
1,Thank goodness I only paid $17.50,"Absolutely horrible unless superglued. Falls apart like you wouldn't believe. I can't believe some spend $69.95 on this. I bought it on clearance for $17.50, knowing it had bad reviews, and was prepared to superglue it like one or two reviewers had suggested. We did just that, and it is ok for now. It it large and looks impressive and has some cool features (as long as they hold up), but was shockingly rickety until superglued. I won't send it back because I only spent $17.50 and it is ok (for now) with a whole tube of superglue holding it together."
2,falls apart,"This toy contantly falls apart as my six-year-old plays with it. It is too difficult for him to put back together and time consuming for an adult. All of the parts fall off, as many as 20 pieces, so the pieces end up everywhere. This product would be better for a adult collector not for kids."
3,New & Not Improved,"It was a disappointment to read how she went on to overwork this book. If you can get an earlier edition, it's much more inspired."
5,What more could you ask for?,"Beaux Arts Trio has done it again. If you must own a set of Mozart's trios for Piano, Violin, and Cello, this is the set for you. As mentioned in my other reviews, I have a huge collection of classical CDs. This box set is expensive but aren't you worth it?"
1,Zero stars. Sent a wire instead of a cake knife.,"Angel Food Cake CutterSomeone is not paying attention in the shipping department.I ordered an angel food cake knife which looks like an Afro comb.They sent a wire with 2 handles on it.It would be possible but clumsy to cut cake with this wire,and the cake might fall off the plate if you drag a wire over it.AND... the wire looks like a weapon.So, I had to report it and wait for a shipping label,then box it up and then mail it back.and I STILL DON'T HAVE an angel food ******* CAKE KNIFE a month later."
1,DIDN'T WORK FOR ME,"I was so excited to get this but even though the spikes are very sharp, it did not cut through my homemade angel food cake. It may work on store bought ones. As for me, I'm back to the ole serrated knife."
5,Angel Food Cake Cutter,Didn't even know they were made but I can always rely on Amazon to have the latest. I brought 7 of them as gifts for those who like different kitchen gadgets. They have loved them.
4,A classic UFO book that belongs in every enthusiasts library,"Hopkins whose ""Missing Time"" caused a sensation in the UFOcommunity and general public alike with its claim that humanswere being whisked away by aliens for experimental purposes,in this follow up work focuses on the abduction experiences of a young woman and herfamily members. The author presents the evidence, suggests possible conventionalexplanation for the bizarre events, and deftly eliminates allof them in favor of the only rational one: that what is beingdescribed is exactly what happened."
2,Questionable Methods.,"Budd Hopkins, has spent many years working with people who feel that they may have been abducted by ""aliens"". During that time he has come to the theory that the ""aliens"" are using humanity for a cross-breeding program. He bases this on similar accounts involving procedures taking sperm and ova samples from many people in quite different sections of the country (U.S.A.)I feel that Mr. Hopkins truly wants to help these people, many of which seem to be suffering from some sort of anxiety disorder. I do however, question his strong reliance on hypnosis to recover these memories. Many studies recently have shown how easy it is for someone asking leading questions to a hypnotized person to inadvertantly imprint false memories.Not the best written book, but interesting. I do wish a little more scientific rigor had been followed by Mr. Hopkins in his investigations."
5,"Marina Lima - ""Millennium""","Obviously, I have chosen a five-star rating for this product. The reason behind this is because I enjoy listening to Brazilian music, especially that of Marina Lima. I first heard her music back when I was in High School and I have enjoyed listening to it ever since. Yes, she is considered a Brazilian rock musician, but many, if not all of, her songs have a catchy beat to them which is what I believe makes me continue to enjoy her music. Words cannot describe how happy I was when I found this CD, which is a collection of some of her greatest hits. To me, finding a CD that contains many of my favorite songs is like being awarded one hundred dollars. I encourage anyone and everyone who loves good Brazilian rock music to try this CD, as you will not regret your decision."
5,This book does for marketing what a LASER does for light!,"Putman has crystallized the essence of what it really takes to build a business successfully. There's no academic hype or muddle, just delightfully practical insights you can transfer easily from where you're learning to where you're earning with his guidance. His coaching style combines with a caring, supportive attitude, tons of practical ideas and a 'do-able' process to make you truly effective at marketing what you're selling. Good show, Anthony, GOOD SHOW"
5,If you are a Professional / Small Business: seek no more,"Simple, straithforward and to the point (hitting the mark). Good advice that does not just sound good, but is being presented in a very practical hands-on way. Very well written, very practical to implement (take your own step-by-step actions). A definite good buy and destined to become a classic."
4,Maybe I need to read more....,"I can't say that this book is not good, and as far as I have read it is a very good way to help students learn how to write argumentively. Also, to help them improve on diversifying their resources.So, I read on... :D"
2,Not all that good,"The amateurish nature of the coverart to this book made me suspect what was in store, but I bought and read the book anyway--and my suspicions were proved correct. These stories are just not all that good. I hate to say such a thing, but unfortunately, it's true. There are twenty-five stories in all, each no more than four or five pages. Most of the stories consist largely of the background to the hauntings, and what mention there is of the haunting is far from ""spine-chilling"". A must read this is not."
4,SO CUTE!!!,"They're on the small side, the size wasn't listed when I bought them, which was weird. The tag says, 3-12 months, Up to 20 lbs. I cannot see any 9-12 month old being able to wear these!! They're 100% cotton, which is great, they seem pretty soft. I haven't washed them yet since I'm not due for a while and have yet to wash all my baby clothes. It's not the greatest cotton ever, and not organic, but they're just so cute with the little froggy feet! Bunnies By the Bay is by far my favorite baby clothes company, they have the cutest stuff ever. Really cute design ideas and cozy little sweet, super cute clothes.They are unfortunately made in China, which is a bummer."
2,Loan from Library. Do NOT buy!,"Wow! I just got finished with this book. I thought I would like it because I enjoy the ""Undead"" books, but this was awful. The werewolf Derik's dialog borders on stupidity. I had to put the book down a few times just so I could get through it. The whole story just seemed so contrived and fake. Nothing really happens in the book (except for some camping across country). The only real action happens at the beginning and end.The ""relationship"" between the two leads, Derik and Sara, is not even developed. They just kind of fall into bed together.I guess I like my alpha werewolves with some backbone and a case of the overprotective bug. There are people trying to kill them and Derik takes time out to follow around Rachel Ray (leaving Sara alone)!Loan this from the library if you must read it, but don't pay good money for it. It will wind up being a dust collector."
4,Alpha werewolf meets his magical match,"This a very funny light hearted fast paced book in a were wolf series. I loved it and it isn't even the first in the series.It is romantic, magical and fun. It makes you feel comfortable enough to go back and read the beginning of the series and makes you want to go on to read the rest."
2,"Readable, but two dimensional...","This book is not difficult to read, it does have flow and it is funny at parts. But, it doesn't really involve you or make you feel attached to the main characters. The attraction part of the story is forced and not believable either. Overall, it felt like a comic book."
3,Duh....I dunno,"Okay, I will admit that parts of this book are amusing, and Derik is just a doll, but Sara annoys me as much as the other heroines in MaryJanice Davidson's full length novels. Her short stories and anthologies are great, but the heroines in her novels make me feel like I would have to be the stereo-typical dumb, Valley blonde to appreciate them. Sara is obnoxious, vague, stubborn, shallow as a puddle after a five minute rain shower, and not too bright, despite being a supposed basic genius. I would not recommend this book to anybody with an IQ over 102."
1,disappointed...,"I'm a fan of Davidson after reading her Queen of the Undead books, and I was expecting a book on par with those. Unfortunately, the plot, while one would expect it to be rather exciting, felt more like a prologue. I kept wondering when I'd get to the real story! I finished the book and had that sinking ""that's it?"" feeling. I felt cheated. It was a good idea, but it never managed to engage me the way I expected. The only reason I kept reading was that I expected it to get better, to live up to my expectations. I should have given up and not wasted my time. Maybe the problem was that she centered on a man as opposed to her usual focus on a woman. I don't know. All I know is that, unlike her Vampire Queen books, I will never reread this book, and heartily regret paying any money for it at all."
4,another good one,"Another good one by MaryJanice Davidson. Warewolves and witches, what could be better?"
4,This Rocks!,"I loved this story, my first experience with the author, will be buying more. There were some odd\""yeah right"" moments but the stories momentum sailed me past them. If you like fantasy\romance you'll probably dig this :)"
3,"cute, but.....","I much preferred Michael and Jeannies story in the Secrets book, this one just seemed like a cartoon. It was cute and made me smile at times but it did not have the slight bit of darkness and manhandling that I like."
3,A Good Werewolf and an Evil Sorceress,"Derik is one of the Wyndham werewolves and is becoming or has become an alpha, meaning he'll have to find a new home. His alpha sends him away on a mission to a kill a woman he's never even met. This bad #$@ is a fan of Rachel Ray and is convinced if he could smell her up close he'd have confirmation that she's really a werewolf. Supposedly the reincarnation of the evil Morgan Le Fey has no idea that she's supposed to be evil. The novel just sort of chugged along and didn't have too much zip. I guess if I'd read the other books in the series, I might have felt differently. Maybe I should have taken it more lightheartedly. It's too cutesy to be a book about a werewolf and a sorceress. I like my novels with more substance and definitely more of a bite!"
2,"Cute dialogue, but unbelievable characters!","I was hoping that ""Derik's Bane"" would have the same charisma as the werewolf stories in Davison's ""Secrets"" books. And it did start out that way, with Derik's provocation of Michael setting off a fight, possibly to the death. However, so much of this book was unbelievable that it was like chewing cheap gum that won't hold together. For example, the deadly attackers who fail to assassinate the heroine--they fall over, etc.--make no impression not only on her, but apparently also on the rest of the hospital staff. No one seems even upset. In fact, no one in the hospital seems even to notice the deadly attempt. No one calls the police. It's as if a group of rowdy boys have misbehaved. The characterization was very uneven and ""jerky,"" not smooth. Yes, the dialogue is funny--Davidson is rightfully famous for that. I laughed often. The hero and heroine fall in love and I just didn't care. You might, But then again, you probably won't."
1,No good for blocking sun on a patio,"I bought these to drape across the open sides of our patio to block the sun, but the material is like gauze; you can see out of them like a window, and the sun shines through them just as brightly. I will have to buy an additional, thicker material to glue onto them to block the sun better. In the picture, they look much more solid than they are."
4,It's A Timer,"I use it for baking. I like the fact that it counts hours and minutes instead of minutes and hours like many of the other alarms I found on Amazon. The last minute counts down in seconds. It is very easy to use. I live in an apartment and the alarm beeps loudly enough that I can hear it in another room. I'm not sure how loud it would seem if someone was on the other side of a house from the kitchen. All in all it's a timer and it serves it's purpose. My only issue is that the display is always on. There isn't a way to turn it off so ""0:00"" will always be on the screen. I don't care as long as the battery lasts. I recommend this timer."
2,"Too noisy when setting time, no memory feature","This is too noisy when setting the timer. I've had timers that are silent when setting the time. If you want to set it for 50 seconds, you have to hear 50 loud beeps. Also, no memory feature. I returned the product and wouldn't recommend it."
2,More trouble than it's worth.,"This timer takes watch batteries, as opposed to your standard AAAs, does not remember the last time you programmed like most digital timers and is top-heavy with a weak magnet, so it wont stay upright on the fridge or stove. Honestly, I got what I paid for, so I don't have anyone to blame but myself."
3,Decent,Good value. Does what it's meant to. Pretty well made. A little on the loud side.I can't use it for my purpose as I can't travel with it - the buttons just get pressed in my bag. Now way to switch that off or cover them.
3,To Catch A King,"Another great not well known WW2 story. Good acting and script. I have read a lot about SD General Walther Schellenberg, who headed the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Nazi Security Service (SD), and he is well portrayed in the film. Wish that other exploits of him were portrayed in film as well as those of SS General Otto Skorzeny who was head of the German Commandos. Another personages well portrayed were the former King of Great Britain and his american wife."
1,Deeply Flawed Presentation of a Very Interesting Subject,"The subject of the international intrigue surrounding the Duke and Duchess of Windsor's stay in Portugal after the fall of France could make a great film. This is not it. The casting; the script; and the acting all are supremely bad. Robert Wagner in white dinner jacket with cigarette in hand acting as some kind of displaced Rick from ""Cassablanca"" is just silly. Terri Garr is terrible in this. There's not a moment of real tension; real drama or real humanity in this. In a word: horrible."
3,"Good Story, So-So Acting","I thought the story of this movie was quite good, but the movie was brought down a star due to the lack-luster acting."
2,Ozark Trilogy,"I didn't find this readable, but not for the reason one would think. The author does an excellent job of keeping her worldbuilding from being hokey, and she clearly has some knowledge of and respect for Appalachian culture. Readers worried about whether they'll be able to handle flying mules shouldn't.The bad news for me was the lack of action and challenge in the books. I simply got bored by the insignificance of most of what happened. I don't utterly unrecommend this omnibus; readers who like sort of chatty, slightly humorous, light fiction may well enjoy it. I like dark, gritty stuff, and it didn't work for me."
1,Waste of Time and money,I can't believe IMAX allowed their name to be connected to this film. I teach Chinese history and I had high hopes when I bought this DVD - needless to say - I'm trying to figure out a way to get rid of it!
2,Not up to the IMAX standards,I was very disappointed with this video - I've seen much better on the History Channel.
3,Rather Scholarly,"While this book is no doubt well-written on the specific topic it is devoted to, for the non-specialist most of it will be of limited interest.However, it DOES contain interesting ethnographic notes on Seram in general and the Huaulu in particular.With relatively little published on the ethnography of this island recently, I would still say this book is a worthy purchase for those interested in the great ""Nusa Ina"" (Mother Island) of Central Maluku."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"I am very disappointed with my Claws-Off purchase. The holes which would enable the 2 pieces to attach are off and do not ""snap"" in place like they should. A small gust of wind and they are blowing in the wind. You have to attach one half to the outside of the screen which does not make sense. The cat is inside!!It is a great idea that is horribly designed. It's just 2 pieces of plastic - so about 99.9% over charged.I feel ripped off. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
1,Not as good as they say,"I purchased this item. If your cat is as smart as mine they know how to grab the side of it and tear it off the screen door. All it is, is a piece of plastic with 2 strips at the top and bottom. The strips have pins that match the other side. You're suppose to snap them together. Well that works fine, but it also could mean making holes into your screen. Also some of the pins break into the strip and do not snap the way they are suppose to.Save your money. It's just not worth the time or cost."
5,best available survey,"this is the best (probably only) survey of academic research into double stars. the text is apparently based on university level lectures, as it is divided into concise, dense sections on single topics, strung together without chapter breaks. the coverage is exhaustive of what was known of binary stars circa 1970, so the emphasis is somewhat outmoded -- extensive coverage of the methods used to derive binary orbits, little about how binary stars form or the exotic varieties of semidetached binary systems -- but there is much here that is not readily available elsewhere. an excellent and essential reference for anyone seriously interested in double stars, and willing to work through a dense, sometimes technical but always authoritative presentation."
3,Stor-A-Key with lock,The product is a good idea but since it is made of plastic a hammer can easily break it open to get the key.
3,Basic Light not just for Watercolour,"Watercolour Basics Light by Judy Morris is a good read not only for those who work in watercolour but also for other medium artists. Knowledge regarding light to define form etc is essential for those who love representational work. Easy to understand the book's a ""must have"" for beginner painters. Well worth having in your library."
4,Colors are too bright,I did not care too much for this book. All items in this book are too vivid and bright. Not my style.
3,hard to set,"I like the size of this little clock, and the atomic time setting works great. But the instructions are very unclear as to how to set the alarm. I'm still not sure what the 2 symbols at the right stand for. One looks like it stands for sound, the other is a bell. I can't tell how to know if the alarm is set to daily or snooze. The alarm sound is also very soft. Fortunately I'm a light sleeper. I do like the thermometer function."
5,A new face on an old genre,Horror entertainment has been around for many years but Zombeast adds a new face and new depth. Combining the occult with the horrors of war makes this novel a diverse work and distinctly different. Jack Keyman
1,Might make a good B movie,"This poorly written book full of cliched images and comic book plot elements isn't much worth the price or the time it takes to wade through it. I can see this becoming a B movie and airing on one of the cable networks, and my recommendation is to wait for the movie. At least that way you know your suffering will be over in two hours."
2,Scratched/Marred right out of box!!! Coulda been a contender!,"Not sure who to blame... too big an amazon box that let the okuma reel box bounce around too much or if the reel was dropped on the factory floor before they stuck it in the box. soooooo bummed. my other beef is that the reel came configured where to wind in the line, one would reel counterclockwise. surprised that that's the default orientation. they included decent instruction on how to reverse that but it involved a tiny phillips screwdriver/screws and a little pushing/handling on brand new, oiled up bearings.Other than that, the bearings and drag systems seem pretty smooth.Is there a way to attach a pic to this review?? I was able to on the packaging review...."
1,specs,"I would consider buying Okuma even after beingcompletely dissed by a woman at Okuma customersupport. How simple is it to write 4/5, 6/7etc. Let me fish and not battle some moronthat obviously has no connection with thiercustomer base.jb"
4,nice reel,"I'm not a fly fishing expert, but this seems to be a really well made, nice looking reel for the price. I haven't caught anything big enough to worry about the drag yet, but for the price I'd buy this reel again."
2,Test fit it first!,"Maybe it's unfair to rate this reel until I've fished it, but spooled it up today and went to put it on my 8wt. Front foot is too thick to fit in the reel seat. I've NEVER had a reel that did not fit the appropriate weight reel seat. Since it was already loaded, I decided not to return it, and carefully tapered the front foot so that it would fit. I expect an inexpensive reel to have less than perfect drag and some cosmetic problems, but this is ridiculous."
2,Not Bickham's forte,"Jack Bickham writes a varied type of Novel. I've read all of the Brad Smith Tennis series . His Westerns are usually 4 star efforts. His family oriented books, such as ""Baker's Hawk"", are great. But, when he writes about Bank Robberies (""The Silver Bullet Gang""), or in this confused tale about the stealing of a virus, Jack Bickham's efforts leave a lot to be desired. As in ""Silver Bullet Gang"" the main character (Davey, here) is not very likeable. I , early on, got a little tired of his negative attitude. Also, to me, the plot makes very little sense. If you wnt to try a likeable Jack Bickham book there are LOTS of better options."
1,"I love Rossetti, but...","This edition is horrible. It has no line breaks. Apparently, Amazon doesn't think the original line breaks are necessary to a poem. All poems should just have the same formatting as prose because it doesn't change anything. That seems to at least be the attitude of Amazon.If you want a good copy, I suggest you find another site that provides free public domain e-books. There are quite a few."
5,go yankees,"Buena se los recomiendos, y muy economico, y muy rápido le doy 5 estrella en puntos eficaz y veloz buen producto"
1,"Horrible, Stupid, Dumb","My gosh! How could someone stand this game! It's the worst game ever. It gives Spongebob a bad name!Bad things:1.The game controls are unspeakable. You would need a technician to figure them out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!2.Graphics. Dang, They've hit all time low.3.After 5 levels. That's it. There is no way to beat level 5.4.AGHHH! IT FREEZES!Good Things:THERE ARE NO GOOD THINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Echo,I would have to echo the last reveiwers sentiments. My 5 year old thought this game was incredibly easy and he was very dissapointed he could not play the last level when spongebob made it to the park. I only paid 5$ for this game and could not even imagine paying 20$!!
1,"Do Not Purchase, this is not the Original This is a bad representation","This is a mis-representation of this item completely. This is a very very thick pottery version of the original. The coloration is even different. There is absolutely no compairson. I have a service for 8 of the Sakura original Colonial and this is not even close. I am very disappointed in the representation of this. And not the cost to return is rediculious. Do not purchase this if you have the original.Sakura Colonial 16-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for Four"
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"I had bought a dinner plate, a bread plate and a bowl at a store called ""Out of the Closet"". They were a fine grade of china, and I was hoping to add to these three pieces. What I got was a very thick heavy low grade copy of the original pieces I had.I was very disappointed, but I did not send them back only because I had not received delivery, and Amazon had to replace the order that was lost somewhere at DSL.I doubt if they will want me to write any more reviews."
1,where's the 'water'?,"After installation, the water was coming out so slow that it was ridiculous! Great craftsmanship, but water was just not there. Checked everything, and still the same problem............ returned it."
1,"""Essentials"", but not much more","I expected something a bit more in-depth rather than a primer. There really isn't much here that wasn't covered in each of the, sort of generalized, real estate practice books I purchased for about the same price.I was severely disappointed with the short shrift given to most of the topics and pity those poor souls who paid list price for this book."
3,Essentials Of Real Estate Finance by Steven Vornea,"Thought this book was more of a starter for individuals interested in real estate finance. If you're an experienced player in real estate, you may find this book to be quite boring. Beginners should take a liking to the read.Best,Steven Vornea"
5,"Real Estate Finance, Excellent Instruction & Reference Book","This book gives in depth instruction in Real Estate Finance. The author not only explains lending from a commerical perspective, he also addresses the residential market as well.This is an excellent book for instruction as well as reference."
2,This is NOT a Phyllis Hyman Album!!!,"Sure, her picture is on the cover..BUT this is NOT a Phyllis Hyman Cd. Sure....she sat in on a jam session...and for those that think she would sound good if she sang the phone book....this is about as close to that wish as you can get."
5,Shells as a Nature's beauty,"This book represents a splendid 'celebration of shells' written by a man with an ardent passion to shell-bearing animals of the Ocean. It is so unique that I recommend it even to professional malacologists (though the book is intended to much wider auditorium and it is not a scientific monograph). ""A natural history of shells"" is a concise and full of interesting considerations introductiob to study of molluscan shells as one of the most attractive examples of Nature's beauty. The author deals with many aspects of shells ranging from the geometry of their structure to ecology of molluscs (soft-bodies animals) that live within them. So, it is a true ""natural history"" in the exact meaning of this term as it was understood in the epoch of Linnaeus, Buffon, Cuvier, Darwin and other great naturalists of the past."
3,Review of Natural History of Shells,I never knew there was so much to the history of shells until I read this book. I love how the author ties in evolutionist theories throughout the book and how much shells and fossils can teach us.
3,Cascadu Review,Very pleasant pleasing tunes. I ripped two of my favorite songs for use around the pool at our all inclusive resort near Cancun last month. Everybody loved the sounds and wanted to know who was the artist.
2,No smell to Stinky Stickers,Scratch and Scratch still not more than a faint smell that lasts no more than just a few minutes. Whatever happened to the Scratch and Sniff stickers of old?
3,"Fun, but not smelly enough","I really want to like these. They look ok, but the fun smell just isn't there. They smell something, but it's funky, nauseating, and they all smell pretty much the same.The kids love them anyway."
4,"Great book, but compact","Tom Ferguson's book is the standard at the UCLA Department of Statistics and for good reason. The book follows a logical format, essentially proving a different limit theorem/approximation in each chapter. The book is good for an advanced graduate 1 quarter/semester course in asymptotic theory, although some of the topics may have to be omitted. I wouldn't recommend reading this book by yourself since I find it to be very compact/concise. However, if you've taken a similar course already it makes an invaluable reference."
4,"Response to ""A Reader"" from Cheyenne, WY","A Reader must be thinking of another writer. Ernest Haycox died in 1950, long before personal computers, let alone the Internet, existed. I have read all of Mr. Haycox's books, and remain a devoted fan."
2,Mostly Good Cast,"It would have been better without Carradine (What is with that stupid smirk on his face?). Haley Du Mond is beautiful and talented. It must have been a chalenge for her to act as though she loved Carradine's character. Reynolds was good but the flowing long hair in the 1920's? The diologue was also inconsistant with the time period, as were many other details. The sound quality was [poor]. It is too bad because with a little effort this could have been pretty good."
4,"If You've Only Tried The Cologne, You Haven't Experienced MJs BAV","We've been wearing this scent for about a year now, and we love it. It's earthy, soothing and instantly takes me away. I honestly think I would have loved this, even if it wasn't Michael's fave. But they recently auctioned off a an autographed personal bottle of Mike's BAV. It sold for over a grand. We feel confident this was indeed Michael's favorite perfume; one of many he no doubt used. We love it and are completely addicted. Like Michael, it's simply sublime. But make no mistake, the full potency of the perfume is far more sublime. This cologne is good for a quick spritz though, and works well as a body spray. Try spraying it in your sheets; maybe you'll dream of Michael. Worked for us!"
4,Bal A Versailles by Jean Desprez for Women,"I purchased this cologne because I learned that it was one of several that was used by Michael Jackson and I was curious. This may sound odd but I was always curious as to how he smelled. I'd read that some people referred to his scent as soft or light and pleasant. I was surprised to find that this is not soft, in my opinion, but it is a fragrance that I enjoy. It is similar in quality to a lighter version Tabu which I wore for many years and loved. I would recommend this to anyone male or female. I love that I am able to wear something that he really enjoyed."
3,The holes as tall as they ought to be,"The shoe holes are not big enough for mens shoes, and some womens shoes won't fit either.But we're still happy with it."
1,Not very Sturdy,"I bought this almost a year ago and have tried and tried to make it work. I agree with many of the other complaints here. Long story short, the slots for the shoes are very small and the entire thing tends to lose its shape under the weight of the shoes. Every time I would open the door shoes would fall out of it. I eventually ended up using just part of it for flip flops, flats, etc but it would always swing and get stuck in the door. While I liked the idea of this product, the design and quality is flawed."
1,Don't bother.,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. My mom had one of these a few years ago, so I bought this one. Come to find out the rope she had holding it up in the center was NOT because she'd broken something on it, but simply because of its bad design. Any shoes with heels stack up on top of whatever's below it, and once you get it full it sags like nobody's business. Her solution was to attach a rope to the top center and forcibly make it hold at more of a 90-degree angle. That worked pretty well, but I didn't want to mess with all that. I bought a floor-to-ceiling, spinning shoe rack instead."
2,Already used and cheep,"I just received my package. It was already dirty (used) and had a dead beetle in it. The legs got stuck in some cracks so I am going to have beetle legs in my shoe rack forever. gross. also the slots do not hold my whole shoe, meaning the heels are sticking out in most of them. It looks pretty cheep, but I guess that is what you get for 11 dollars. I just started using it, so I hope it doesn't break like everyone is saying it will."
1,Not worth the trouble,"I have returned this product twice now. The first time it arrived without the metal door hangers. The second time, everything was in the box, but once I got it up and put shoes in it, it sunk under the weight of the shoes. It looked horrible, and it was so hard to get the shoes in and out of the pouches. Find something with a hard/metal/plastic frame, it's worth the extra money."
2,"Eh, ok for small doors",We got this b/c we live in an apartment and it has smaller doors than would fit a more sturdy shoe rack. I wish we had cut the steal bars instead. This kinds slouches in the center and cant hold two pairs of running shoes together. It is fine for my dress shoes or flats. Maybe for a kids closet this would work well.
1,Ripped Immediately,"I didn't even have half of the slots filled and it came crashing down within 5 minutes of hanging it up. The material ripped right where it hangs onto the medal door hanger. Also, one of the plastic pieces that hold the outer top/bottom of each slot snapped in half pretty easily as I put a pair of shoes in. I wouldn't buy this product again - two breaks (one major) in less than 5 minutes when it calls itself ""durable"" is a problem..."
2,Not what I expected :-(,"I bought two one broke the same day a stored shoes in it the, the other is still ok, but the compartments are not long enough and shoes keep falling or hanging out, looking messy"
3,Shoe Rack Reveiw,"Purchased two , they're nice that they go over the door inside the closet. It holds way more shoes than built for. Especially, with the wedge and how heavy some are. It is held by a sturdy plastic square piece that my daughter was able to break with it loaded within first couple days of use. Then stitching came loose on one of loops that goes on hook of over the door part. I was able to go buy two over the door hooks for our door at bed bath because are doors are thicker than a standard door and I now have it hung that way. It is still a nice idea but not very sturdy. It is just hard to find something that can be concealed within the closet. I would still buy another one for her just because it does meet the need with our space--even if I had to rig it again."
5,Great!,I had this shoe organizer before and it took many years of lots of use to wear it down. I'm happy to have a replacement. I holds the most shoes in the smallest space.
1,No good,No good no sirve para na gaste mi dinero apenas lo puse se me rompio y ni los sapatos silvieron dentro de los espasio
1,Bad Quality,This thing broke right away and my shoes don't even fit with out forcing them in. When I forced my shoes in it broke. I threw it out because I didnt even wanna bother returning it.
1,Broke after 1 month!,I had this product years ago and wanted to replace it...unfortunately it broke after just 1 month. As they say-they don't make things like they used to.
2,Not made to hold alot of weight,"It does have enough slots for alot of shoes, but the slots are not big enough for today's style of wedge shoes. I filled it with shoes and the next morning the plastic clips that hold it on the door hooks had broken, and it was on the floor!"
2,hooks provided do not support the weight,"Overall this item is ok. It helped clear the floor of my closet of all the shoes. I have extra slots available to add more shoes. However, the second night of the shoes hanging over the door, the plastic hooks provided with the product broke and they all came crashing down. I have purchased some metal D rings to replace the plastic rings and hope that this helps keep it hanging."
2,Good and Bad combined,It has a great design and great functionality but the quality is awfull and the depth of each hole is just not deep enough for the adult shoes to fit properly. It's also very cheaply made and it's a bit expensive considering it only lasts for a short time.
1,Reveiw,I did not love this! It is pretty cheap item. It did not last but a week. It ripped and I had to throw it away
2,not very happy,It looks like it does in the pictures although it is not as durable. My shoes barley fit and easily fall out. I'm not very pleased with this product what so ever and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
2,Not Worth it,This product is horrible the shoes wont't stay inside the pockets they keep falling out. i expected more from the product i would not recommend this to anyone it is a waste of money. i wish i had the heads up on this before i purchased it. i did not do my research
2,Not really good,"It only holds the tennis shoes that are bigger because they actually use the entire space, shoes like heels fall because the back part of the shoe is havier so the hanger doesn't hold it, and sandals, they just slip away, and the hager holds only half of the shoes, the length of each hanger doesn't even hold the entire shoe, it stops in the middle, half of the shoe is hanging out, so of corse the shoes are going to fall! Unless you have a lot of tennis shoes, I don't recomend it."
2,disappointed,this is a great idea but the materials used are cheap and the shoe slots are way too small....was hard to get a pair in one of the slots....and i am a size 6 footi do NOT recommend this product
1,Cheap plastic hooks,I have older doors which are thicker than the standard so this is the only shoe organizer that will fit over my door frames. It does hold a lot of shoes which is nice but the two pices holding it on to the medal hooks is plastic. Ive been lucky and had one that has lasted a year. My other just broke & put up a new one that broke 20 seconds after I put my shoes in. I've ordered 3 more cause probably only one of them might last more than a few hours or a week without the plastic breaking. I don't recommend this product unless you only have a couple pairs of shoes cause the plastic will break on you and not worth it. If I could find a shoe organizer that would fit on my older thicker doors I would toss these instantly.
3,Not for people with large feet,"I received the shoe organizer earlier than had been stated - Great ShippingIt was very simple to put together and place on door. The quality of the organizer is ok, butwhen began to place shoes in the compartments the problems started. I wear a ladies size 10 shoe,my shoes with thick soles would not fit into one compartment with ease. Only when forced. Had toplace each shoe in a separate compartment. If you wear size 8 or below, you should nave no problems.A suggestion for an updated model - have the pockets hang level, instead of at a slant.Shoes goes into compartments easier."
1,Too Weak,"After four weeks and not fully filled to capacity the plastic supports broke. One of the tabs has come half way undone. In short, don't waste your money."
1,bad shoe holder,this is bad!!!!don't buy.i want my money back.it can't hold as many shoes that is says.it ripped right away (with in a day or two) most it would hold is 1/2 the amount and they most be very light shoes.
1,please dont expect much if you have large feet,unless you have flat shoes... and size 6 or smaller.. i wouldnt buy this. it is not for normal sized feet or heels.. and it broke week one
4,He tried to get the Mind Box murderer to do it,"I liked the book, but I had heard he tried to contact the clandestine revenge service that was ultimately responsible for The Mind Box murders. Either it got left out, or it was another guy with the same name.Rule rules."
1,Pure (junk),"Don't waste your time on this one unless you think the rock song tag for a title makes it a winner. It lacks the fast pace necessary for an interesting true crime book. If you're looking for more than just sleaze, read any of Gary C. King's books. This one, like all of Ann Rule's drivel, is a real wiener, pure (junk)."
4,"Yes, it's like all Ann's books -- thank goodness!","Sure Ann Rule's books follow a formula. And, like TV's LAW & ORDER, it's a successful way to tell a crime story. In this book, as in all Ann's books, there's the set up, the crime, the investigation, and the final judgement. Her books aren't fine literature, like Truman Capote's IN COLD BLOOD, but classics like that come along very rarely. What Ms. Rule does well is to keep the victim in as clear focus as the villain. Often in books of this genre, the victim and the impact of the crime are lost because criminals such as Blackthorn are so complicated and interesting. Not so here. Shelia, Jamie, Carrie, the older daughters and the quads are never forgotten."
3,"Fine writing, scummy characters","Ann Rule is a fine writer, and the case of the Sheila Bellush is heartbreaking. However, this book might be better if it was 30% shorter. The scumminess and wickedness of Sheila's ex-husband and those who conspired in her murder will wear on your soul long before the end of the book. Some of the power of the narrative in lost in overreporting of Blackthorne's background."
5,Loved this book!,"As a long-time reader of Ann Rule, I am pleased to say that this is her best book yet. While reading this unbelievable story, you will feel like you personally know the characters. Of all of Rule's protagonists, Allen Blackthorne is the most intriguing. He had everything anyone could want, and really nothing to gain by killing his ex-wife, but just couldn't allow her to slip away from his grasp. Well researched and written!"
2,Surprisingly boring...,"I'm a huge true crime fan, a very big Ann Rule fan, yet this one didn't do it for me. To me, Small Sacrifices was a masterpiece. This one was loaded w/unnecessary detail, yet she sometimes left out stuff that the reader would consider important ... for instance - Stevie's sexual abuse allegations against her father seemed to scare Alan, so they must've had merit .... yet it was really never delved into in the story. Another thing - while this crime was about as bad as it gets, and I hope those 4 losers rot in jail for what they did - Sheila was a bit unsympathetic at times. Ann Rule could have at least acknowledged that, rather than chalking it up to being in love, or being afraid. And Jamie was a jerk! I had a hard time understanding why she allowed him to discipline the girls that harshly (11-12 yrs old, being slapped in the face?)."
3,Every Breath You Take,"I'm a big Ann Rule fan. I eagerly await all of her books. However, for the first time I felt that this book was not up to the usual readability. It went into way too much detail at the beginning of the book. It wound us into intricate family detail before we really cared about the characters themselves. Then about 3/4 of the way through the book, I felt like there were entirely too many (boring) details about the men related to the killing. Keeping these guys straight seemed a bit difficulton more than one occasion. The story itself is absorbing, and I understand that we needed to know about the characters' family upbringing. However, many of the details should have been condensed or left out. Unfortunately this is the first of Ann's books that I will not recommend to others as a ""can't put down"" book."
1,Completly One sided.,"This book is completly one sided. Never once did Rule interview the Bellush Family. I believe that she betrayes James as the bad guy, even though she never interviewed any of us. This was a terrible tradgey that hit our family. Don't waste your time reading Rules one sided story. Watch the A&E show instead.!!"
2,Too long and drawn out,"This book is filled with extraneous stuff that could have well been left out. I've loved all the other Rule books I've read, but this one was a real let down for me. It would have been good being half as long.I think it would have been better not written at all, and possibly the request by the victim to have Anne write it clouded her better judgement."
2,Disappointing,"I agree totally with the review below entitled ""B O R I N G"". Ann Rule is one of my favorite authors, but this book is a major disappointment. The story is not compelling, and it could be told in less than an 100 pages instead of over 400 pages. It was hard to finish the book. I don't mean to minimize the horrific murder that occurred, but I didn't find this story to be on par with what I can usually expect from Ann Rule."
2,A tired cliche,"What was it about the stories of Sheila Bellush and Allen Van Houte that made Ann Rule feel compelled to write a book about them? A Dateline special I can understand. Neither of these individuals are very interesting let alone sympathetic. Sheila's second husband, Jamie, was not likable at all. Everyone was a two-dimensional cardboard cutout. Allen was the controlling, overbearing, conniving, abusive ex-husband. Sheila was the dedicated, loving wife, and hapless victim to be. I got the sense from the book that there was more to Sheila's character than that, but Rule never chooses to protray her with any depth.The narrative was not fun to read. I thought that Rule jumped around unnecessarily from time period to time period, and this is especially true when she jumped around when telling the story of the weeks leading to Bellush's death.True crime stories always draw me in, simply for the human drama. Unfortunately, I felt no drama in this story."
3,So-So,"There is something lacking with Ann Rule's latest book. I have read all of her previous books, but this one seems rather dull and lacks the suspense of her earlier works. While the story itself is tragic, she doesn't really convey the drama of it all. Having grown up in the Sarasota area, I think the St. Petersburg Times coverage of this case was far better and would suggest to those who are intersted in the story to search the St. Pete. Times website for their previous work on the case."
4,fast reading,"I gave this book four stars. Intro was very long. All of the characters introduced at the beginning of the book and there were many, I found this very confusing. As you read the book you realized who everyone was but I did not like this lay out of the book."
4,"Every Breath You Take, Another Winner from Ann Rule","She's still the queen of the ""true life"" murder mystery, makes for an exciting read while giving the victim a voiceGreat read"
5,Couldn't put it down,Wow this is narcissism at its best. I read this book in a couple of days and made several attempts to put it down but just had to keep reading. One of the best true crime stories I have read. Truth really is stranger then fiction.
5,AWESOME!,I have read most of Ann Rule's books and this one is the best so far. I could not put it down!
4,Clear Storytelling,Ann Rule's gift has always been the integration of facts in a format that allows readers to discover the gruesome crimes in a more or less chronological order. She relies a bit too much on foreshadowing - a frustration in many true crime books - but in this book she keeps the pace fast and the revelations breathtaking.
3,Laborious but worthwhile,"This story was laborious not so much because of its length (400+ pages) but the tedious pages dedicated to the trial, which I know could not be helped. I'd never read Ann Rule before but she clearly has a talent for getting the details down and bringing a harrowing story into Technicolor on the page."
4,Another Ann Rule Goody,"Ann Rule's books are always fascinating and this one is no exception. Since Rule is a true-crime writer her books are inherently sad, yet compelling. Rule is one true-crime writer who does not write to titillate her audience with gory details but instead respectfully recounts the story of the victim. Read it!"
2,Not one of Ann's best book (in my opinion),"I have read every book that Ann Rule has written, and usually can't wait to read her next book. This was no exception. I purchased, but for the first time, found it difficult to follow, with too many details. It took me awhile to finally finish the book, when I usually read it in two days. I have given every other book by her 5 stars."
2,Can't get passed the 30th page.,"I would not tell anyone to read this book. [No offense to the family it's about] but I wanted a book I could get so into I wouldn't put the book down, this book -- I couldn't keep reading. It's way too boring in the first 30 pages, I just gave up with it. A waste of my money."
2,Disappointing!,"Ann Rule is one of my favorite writers. I have read & enjoyed every book she has written. Unfortunately, this book fell way short of her other books. Her books are usually very hard to put down & has you sitting on the edge of your seat.Unfortunately, this one was quite disappointing. The story was very dry, quite slow, uninteresting & just plain boring.Not one of her best."
5,Every Breath You Take,"I have read every book Ann Rule has written and each time I am amazed that each new book is"" the best I have ever read""until her next book comes out and as always the new book is ""the best"".In writing this book Ann Rule has managed as always to make her readers privy into the very life of the victim and the person responsible for her death- this book delves into obsession and the truly devious and horrific way the final act of this obsession was carried out -a detailed and factual well written gripping book ,as only Ann Rule can write."
2,Never ABRIDGE,"I had trouble following the characters in this audio, yet Rule has a fluid writing style that makes a true story read like fiction. But in this abridged audio version, this talent makes itself apparent only in spurts. I think this is due to the abridgement process.I feel the same way about abridgment as I feel about watching a movie reformatted to fit the television screen; if I am going to invest the time in viewing the movie, I want ALL of the movie. So even if I were reduced to a 12 inch screen, I would want to see the movie in letterbox, if possible.So too, if I am going to listen to a book, I want the WHOLE book. Granted, there are things such as charts and graphs that are tedious in audio, these things are best described in brief, but I do not think this is the sort of pruning and clipping that took place in this abridgement; otherwise, I would have found the characters easier to follow because they would have been much more developed."
3,"Entertaining, but...","What is with the author's obsession with the word ""adamant"" ??? You'd think she would have a thesaurus handy. I agree with a review above, very choppy. Was not the easiest book to read. But it was okay."
2,LaVey's Poorest Effort,"""Hatha Toilet Seat Meditation"" is the most impressive thing here. A more personal approach than his other books, it's also far too narcissistic and whiny to make much impression on most except for self-righteous Christians or know-it-all LaVey worshippers, although amusing in places. LaVey seems to think that by whining about how much he hates everyone he is indulging himself; I agree, but it is the self-indulgence of a spoilt brat throwing a temper tantrum. A volume on his work in lion-taming or psychic investigation would have been much more impressive. The Satanic Bible is better in every way."
3,Babble of a bitter man,"Anton LaVey was an intelligent man. This book however has sparse intelligent thoughts amidst a book full of babble by an angry man turned bitter by age. Often I found myself skimming thru pages wondering if Anton was simply trying to fill this already thin book. Most of the paragraphs are noticeably elongated as if he were being paid by the word. The problem is this book has little to say. While there are some very good thoughts in this book there are simply to few to justify the printing process. Like his past works, he often falls into his own traps. Most of the points he makes in this book could easily be turned upon himself. Any religion is simply a point of view and Satanism is no different. I think Mr. LaVey started believing his own hype."
5,You've all got it wrong...,"Everyone, listen. Realize that when you are talking about Satanism you need to know that it is not about conjuring ""demons"", killing Christians, and the ""occult."" It is about living your life to the fullest without any stupid religious restrictions, ""rejoicing life in the carnal, the mundane, the flesh."" Stop looking at it from a ""Christian"" point of view. This book is good, yes, but of course it's not the first book you want to get if you want to be a Satanist. If you want to do it right, GET THE SATANIC BIBLE 1st! You need to already know this. If you read The Devil's Notebook first, you won't get the right understanding. And enough of the LaVey insults. If you're a Satanist you should have more respect for the man. Nuff said."
3,An Entertaining Read,"This book is a collection of essays, written by Mr. (pope?) Lavey. Judging by the introduction, written by Adam Parfrey, it is some sort of tribute to him - though I am not for sure. It is good for entertainment, though not a whoooole lot else... but then again, books are a form of media, and the whole purpose of media is to entertain, so...Alright, this is deffinatly a great read! I totally, TOTALLY loved the Diabolica, Duck-Billed Platitudes, and How to Be a God! They are all very entertaining and humorous (though I'm not sure whether or not they're supposed to be). Also, the whole book is pretty motivational for that little screaming, raving satanist in all of us.That's about all there is to say about it. I mean, honestly, at only 147 pages, it's not a huge chunk of reading. I read it over one weekend. Not great, but not bad - not by any means bad - hence three stars."
5,Essays From the founder of the Church of Satan,"Various essays from the one who created the Church of Satan. It covers subjects like the Church itself, the new age movement, and various other diabolical thought"
1,Won't stay on the wall!,"We moved into a new house in November. Perfectly pristine walls. I decorated both my sons' rooms with wall borders. My one son chose Dinosaurs, and the other chose this Cars border. Within one week, the Cars border was peeling off the wall. I purchased the recommended spray glue in the case the adhesive didn't work; that held for about a day until it peeled off. This has been a huge disappointment to my son. The Dinosaur border by contrast is fine. I am now looking to replace Cars with Thomas the tank enging but want to ensure I find a different manufacturer as my experience with the Cars border (and stickers) peeling off has been so bad. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Bad book about sandwiches,"This is the third in the Sin series. It is the only one I read. It was so bad I didn't want to read the others. The first two might be good. The first one was made into a fairly good movie.The series is about Detective Delaney who hunts down serial killers. In this book, you meet the killer right off. She is a semi-sympathetic character who is killing bad men, such as cheating husbands. But, the author makes sure she should be caught and punished by having her kill one victim who turns out to be good and has second thoughts about cheating on his wife.Most of the book deals with how the killer does in her victims or how the detective makes a sandwich. Instead getting details on how the crime is solved, we get details about sloppy, gross sandwiches that are eaten over a sink. In the end the crime really isn't solved and the killer is discovered mostly by accident."
4,Simply not as remarkable as his first...but getting there.,"The Third Deadly Sin had a lot of factors that i found resembled the first novel a LITTLE bit too closely, such as the suspect dying of physical deterioration towards the end, the suspect's pathological relation to the act of sex...things like that. Also, the relationship between Monica and Edward Delaney (the detective) really does not clash well with the rest of the story. Who cares what Monica thinks- i think she is a pathetic and dull character- thats also what made the First Deadly Sin much better- it focused more on the detective, not his wife. Otherwise it was a good book. Lawrence Sanders is GOOD, but he was best in ""THe Tenth Commandment."" If anyone is wondering what one person thinks is his best work, thats it."
4,as with the previous titles .....very good,i love new york city police procedural thrillerswas a head of his timeworth keeping it for second or third re-reads
5,"this book shows real columbian life,not hollywood drug deals","Elizabeth Brusco brings to life the real lives of Columbians and how they deal with religion. She specifically uses examples of how protestantism is groing in Columbia and how it ""reforms"" the blatant stereotype of South American men as being macho, ergo the word ""Machismo"". I had the chance of asking her some questions about the book and viewing some pictures taken while she resided in a small village in Columbia, through my Anthropology class taught at Pacific Lutheran University by Dr. Laura Klien. This gave me an even better understanding of what is really going on in columbia, but the book still gives an abundance of information on evangelicalism in Columbia. Read this book, you won't regret it."
3,caveat emptor,"I have to start by saying that I love John Fogerty and this DVD.But, I specifically bought this DVD based on a sentence in the product description ""Also included, in both live and studio versions, is the previously unreleased track ""Comin' Down The Road."". There are two things wrong with that statement: The song was issued as the A-side of a 1973 single (Fantasy F-717) and - more importantly - there is NO studio version included on the disc."
3,"Where is the ""Studio"" version of Comin' Down the Road????","The product description states: ""Also included, in both live and studio versions, is the previously unreleased track ""Comin' Down The Road."" ...there is no studio version on this disc.......anybody have any idea if it is or was intended to be on this DVD????"
5,excellent dvd,"I just love John Fogerty hes fantastic I hope he does a tour to Australia I seen him twice live in concert here,& what a performer so much vitality puts all in to his music.Hes also very handsome. keep rockin John"
3,question about John Fogerty concert at Royal Albert Hall,"Hi ,I purchased this dvd thinking it was a cd along with other cd's for my wife for Christmas. Will it play as a musical cd ?Thanks for your help"
5,100 Minutes of Pure Joy!,"I can't believe what an amazing show this genius/writer/ musicaian provided.True, I'm a CCR / Fogerty fan,I love his old and new stuff, this DVD has it all.His band, the drummer, all of them....blew me away!I ignored reading all the notes on the DVD, just popped it into the player and was greatly entertained with 100 minutes of pure joy.Ramble Tamble, what a surprise .... this is one of my faves from his CCR days, and all I can say is WOW! Same with Old Man Down The Road.The love song to his wife Julie, the song he wrote for his daughter. Simply amazing.His voice is stronger at age 62 then when he was 26, (I think he quit smoking menthols).What a show!!!!"
5,john fogerty,"great purchase, thanks, bought as a christmas present was very pleased with it as it also teaches you to play along with a guitar."
3,Satisfactory,About 80% of the dvd was new music which was not I believe up to John's level. In the latter section he brought his sons out and performed a trio of lead guitarists which was great. The show did end with John's classics. Its satisfactory but not quite what I had expected.
2,not happy,"half of them, the elastic was demaged. weren't big enough to fit my bowls.i wasn't to happy with them."
3,Look around first,I needed one small bowl cover for something unrelated to kitchen use. I looked in or called all of the places that commonly carry these. I came up empty handed. I turned to the internet. As soon as I ordered them online I saw them in several stores for a fraction of what I paid. Look in your local supermarket before you order them. I wish that I had.
1,Advertisement of videos,"This book is the worst Wing Chun (or Wing Tsun) book I've seen, and I've read many. The book is short, the layout is bad, the writing is pretty bad, and it's full of spelling mistakes -- all of which I wouldn't mind if the Wing Chun techniques were explained well. Most techniques are not covered at all, there's often one page worth of discussion why it's essential you should do the technique right, and then you are simply referred to a video that costs [$], no explanation included in the book. 15% of the pages (pp. 84-98) are advertisements of the various videos of the author.I was so surprised about this since all the other reviews were so good. Then I noticed that they were all from ""A reader"" who has been pretty good at reviewing the other books of the same author as well..."
5,Not the typical martial arts book,I found this book to be a very concise and informative Wing Chun guide. This book is very well written and would be an excellent addition to an enthusiast's collection.
5,I loved this book and learned alot!,This book was very helpful to me as a relatively new kung fu student. It explained in details that were easy to understand the this wonderful martial arts system. I would recommend this book to anyone learning martial arts.
4,"Fun, But Some Weeks aren't That Great","I bought this not knowing what to expect. I opened the box and there was this cute little bag along with all of these preforated cards. I had to detach each card individually which was a pain, but all in all it was very fun and really brought some spice to my life. I enjoyed the cards themself and really liked how they were separated beetween guys and girls. Also, the scratchoff part and not knowing exactly what we would pull out of the bag was fun too."
4,fun,i really enjoyed this product i deffently got both of us in the mood fast the only thing i didnt like about it was that some of the cards you have to plan for when we were mre wanting it for an idea for right then but still very fun
1,Are y'all stupid?,Most apparel stores allow you to select size and color on the page where you buy the item. This is an invitation for disaster and screwed up sizing.

1,Seller needs to learn about plural vs. singular,"Seller list this product as PLATES not plate (with a photo of four plates) - a little misleading! (In the many years of shopping with Amazon, this is the first negative review I've ever written.)"
5,Spirit Music,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. An incredible capture of different gypsy cultures and their music (they're really ONE culture, that has spread out through Western Europe and the Middle East). Having grown up in southern Spain and attended elementary school and high-school there, this movie quite moved me. It flooded me with all sorts of memories and emotions, of a people very enlightened, who almost intentionally reject this""cerebral era"" that we live in, and choose to look towards miracles in every day life.Having sat in elementary school with numerous gypsy kids it was great to watch these groups of gypsies traveling through the U.S. on tour. In multiple instances I burst out into laughter watching them interact with our American culture.To end my review and most importantly, this movie is about music. Gypsy music. Which is pure spirit and emotion. I hope you enjoy this movie."
5,Replacement Found,"Unit works great. I had a hard time finding a replacement for an older version of this same unit. Amazon was the only one that had it, and a great price!!"
3,Star Wars Obi Light Saber,I bought two of these thinking that it would light up but it doesn't. The sword sometime retract and some time it's hard to push it in. I am glad I only paid $5.29 for it. I don't think it was worth $5. My kids play with it for about an hour and then toss them.
2,Not Consistent,"I was shocked when I got this delicate thermometer in the mail, wrapped only in a thin plastic envelope with no padding what so ever. It was not broken thank goodness. However, I still would NOT recommend this at all. Every time I take my temperature it gives a different reading. Sometimes several degrees different. You are far better off with an internal thermometer."
2,Difficulties to determine the actual temperature.,"I've measured my temperature many times using this thermometer.But every time I re-check it with the usual thermometer that you put under your arm the temperature, the old fashion thermometer shows it 0,5 degree C* lower!But in case with my friend it can vary from 0,3 to 0,7 C* lower.So it is always difficult to understand the actual temperature."
5,The best Ed Wood merchandise ever!,These collectors' cards are incredibly beautifully illustrated. A must for all fans of Ed Wood and the actors that appeared in his movies from the fifties.
1,"don't bother... I mean really, don't.","This is one of those Christian books that is an embarrasment to Christians everywhere. The book seeks to evaluate music from a Christian perspective, but does a terrible job. This is one of those 'all music with a beat is from satan' books. I have studied mass media and Christianity for several years now, and this is as biased of a book as you can get. On top of that, it isn't even Biblical. I have a copy, and it is all marked up with scripture verses I wrote that are contrary to the authors unBiblical ideas.If you want a good, honest, and balanced book on Chrstians and media, check out Roaring Lambs by Briner."
3,.The area is Muskoka. No such thing as The Muskokas,This area of Ontario name is derived from an Indian Chief. There was only one person so the name can not carry an s. He was a wonderful person and deserves to be honoured. He taught many pioneers how to live in their new home area. Media has sadly slipped into the error of calling the area The Muskokas. It is wrong. Please continue to call it by its correct name. It is Muskoka. Thank you.
3,Sloppy errors,"After a quick review of the area of the map that I am most familiar with, I noted two sloppy errors. ""Los Alamitos Race Track"" is misspelled as ""Los Alimitos Race Track"" in the ""PLACES OF INTEREST"" box. Norwalk Boulevard is shown as going through to Imperial Highway going northbound when in fact Norwalk Boulevard breaks a few blocks before Imperial Highway.For all I know these are the only two errors on the map, but given how quickly I found those errors, I am loathe to depend on this map to guide me in areas with which I'm unfamiliar.If, however, it is a mostly accurate map, this, like other Streetwise maps, is a useful product."
2,Not that useful,This map was fun to hold along in case of emergencies but it turned out that it was not very useful. A quick question to a stranger avery few blocks was more helpful. However this map was great at giving the driver the overall idea of how his area is in relations to what's around him and how far he is from the water or from a particular neighborhood. It's like looking at a google map zoomed out showing you the general area but not very useful showing you where to drive since you won't be able to see the details.
2,no county lines included,"It's a nice map, but I specifically searched for a map with county lines & this came up. It did NOT have county lines & I had to take the time to return it."
2,Not terribly useful.,"It is not Streetwise's fault, but there isn't enough detail on this map for it to be useful. So, if you are traveling around California, this probably isn't going to help you much. Spring for the thicker, but more useful travel atlas."
2,Not what I hoped to see.,"I read the book ""The Color of Magic"" and found it extremely amusing. The DVD? Well, it didn't seem like anything Terry Pratchett ever wrote. I can't see Rincewind being that old either. Perhaps he was, but to me he seemed younger. In the book, the story flowed, but in the film, it seemed to jump around from one thing to another...in other words...to me, it was a dissapointment."
3,Color of Magic Blu-ray version,"This is a review of the Blu-ray version of the movie. The picture is superb and the audio is good, if not great. As far as the adaptation from the novels is concerned I don't think it has done them true justice. The movie is based on Pratchett's first 2 Discworld novels - The Color of Magic and The Light Fantastic. I had previously watched the HogFather and Going Postal on TV and enjoyed both immensely. Before watching this I chose to read the novels first. They were fabulous. If I had watched the video first I think I would have enjoyed it more, and then got further enjoyment from the books. By all means watch the movie and then read the books, IN THAT ORDER, otherwise you may be find the movie lacking, as I did."
3,Weak,"Having greatly enjoyed Hogfather, we were very disappointed by this. Way too much David Jason and Tim Curry playing themselves. Sean Astin was just mechanical. Most of the subtle/sly humour of the books is lost. As others have noted, comic timing was killed by weak direction and editing. The highlight of the movie was Conan."
3,This movie isn't as good as I'd hoped.,The movie arrived in a timely manner and in excellant shape. The movie itself isn't as good as I'd hoped though. I enjoy longer movies but this one is just too slow and plodding so I never have watched the whole thing. I'll give it to my great nephew and niece incase they'll like it.
4,The wit of Terry Pratchett,"The engaging wit of Terry Pratchett is not strongly evident in the movie The Color of Magic. The acting is excellent, the photography well balanced, the staging convincing. The wit is there but does not come through as brilliantly as in the written works of the author. The action moves a little on the slow side. As an avid fan of Mr. Pratchett's work the movie is worth having.Tim Curry has had a productive, brilliant career. He no doubt is one of todays superior character actors. His portral of the villian wizard Trymon is both synister and humorous.Death is a delightful droll entity in both this movie and in Hogsfather.David Jason (Rincewind) and Sean Astin (Twoflower) deliver capturing performances."
4,True to the Book,"I must first say that I am a fan of the Discworld books. I have seen the Hogsfather DVD and did enjoy it. This DVD stays true to the book. Without giving too much away the wonderful visual of the arrival of the tourist into the city, perfect,well done. Keeping in the jokes and the puns between the characters only added to the enjoyment of the DVD. For the fans, please view I'm sure it will bring a smile. If you have never read the books, this may tickle your intrest to read and enjoy the discword series.I have now watched the DVD several times now and each time adds to my enjoyment."
3,"good, but read the book","Terry Pratchett is the king of satirical comedy and this movie is a faithful rendition of his first book. Casting was well-done and for those who are Discworld fans, this is a fairly accurate version (better than most 'based on a book' movies). However, Terry was still 'finding his feet' at this time, and both the book and the movie reflect that. If you haven't read Pratchett before, start with the books and then give the movie a try. Otherwise, you might find yourself lost in the twisting alleyways of the Shades."
5,Really great,This mini series is very silly and darkly humorous. I loved watching it and Hogfather and I wish there were more.
3,I would have enjoyed it more with closed captioning,"As a hearing impaired person, I need closed captioning to help me with the dialouge, especially accented dialouge. I was extrememly disappointed to find there was no closed captioning on this disc. Now, before you all tell me I should have read the specs first, The Hogfather has closed captioning even though that is not mentions in its specs. I thought all TV shows (and this film was made for Sky-TV) were required to have closed captions, but maybe that's only in the US.I am really sorry I can't hear the humorous dialouge I experienced when reading the book. (Sigh)"
4,DVD The Colour of Magic,"Excellent rendition of the story, but who is doing the editing. The books never plod along at this slow pace."
3,Too much in too little time,"The film tried to combine ""Color of Magic"" and ""Light Fantastic"" into three hours, so a lot of great stuff was left out. I have a feeling anyone who hadn't read the books would spend most of movie saying, ""Huh? What just happened?"" Still, if you love the Discworld, you have to see this one. Sean Astin wouldn't have been my first choice for the role of Twoflower, but to my surprise he was perfect."
5,If you love the Diskworld series you will love this.,It does not follow the first two books exactly but when does a move ever? Enjoyable if you like the Diskworld series.Scott-
1,Mostly disappointing.,"If you're unfamiliar with Pratchett's work, this adaptation is unlikely to hook you. Instead of the sharp satire of the novels, it's just fantasy rehashed with some CGI and terrible, terrible acting. Sean Astin pretty much ruined this all on his own; there wasn't a single scene he was in that didn't leave me cringing. Worse, Jeremy Irons butchtered the clever and icy Patrician, giving him a lisp, of all things. I was embarrassed just watching this. Some of the storytelling was cute, but you'd be better off with the actual books. Hogfather was a thousand times better, and I didn't even like the original book all that much. Really, if you much be introduced to Pratchett through television, go with Hogfather, which was much truer to the book and to Terry's intelligent style."
1,Movies That Suck,"I bought this movie used for $3.00. Unfortunately, it is not worth 3 cents. This is absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen and believe me I tried and tried. As a long-time Terry Pratchett fan I am horrified! Jeremy Irons, Tim Curry and Sean Astin. All actors I love. All doing complete crap in this movie. It was embarassing to watch. Don't bother with this total loser, you will regret it."
4,color of magic review,"It is hard to render the written word into a visual form; every reader imagines the story differently. That being said, I enjoyed the movie. It was not like I imagined it but I still found it fun to watch. As an introduction to Terry Pratchett's discworld series it will serve to pique an interest. Plus it was fun to see Pratchett in a cameo role."
3,Better as a book,"I love Terry Pratchett, and love Sean Astin, but it's just too hard to do justice to the Luggage for this to be a great show. Would watch again, but rarely."
4,pretty good,a good family night movie for movie night as it may hold your attention for thirty 30 - to forty 40 minutes
3,"Terry Pratchett's ""Colour of Magic""","Originally a two-part telemovie, ""The Color of Magic"" uses elements of Terry Pratchett's ""The Colour of Magic"" (he's English, they spell it that way) and ""The Light Fantastic"". I found it a little more convoluted than, say, the excellent ""Hogfather"" movie, and to my mind David Jason doesn't match any other depiction of Rincewind the failed wizard. But he doesn't have to. And Sean Astin doesn't even try to look like an Asian tourist - anyway, how can a Hobbit not succeed in a fantasy movie? Fans won't be disappointed. The cast are all great, and with Death, the Librarian (who's NOT a monkey) and the nicely animated Luggage, it can't fail."
1,buyer beware,This blu-ray did not play on either of my blu-ray players - both Sony. Another reviewer says he was told that it will not play on PS3 or Sony. You may have problems with it.
3,"Nice color, bad streaks.","After reading the good reviews of the Tantowels, I was excited to use it. I used one towellette - then another 3 hours later.First the smell - when you're applying the towelette the smell is very pleasant - basically like a normal wet-wipe. But hours later that typical artificial tan ""chemical smell"" appeared, and stayed there.The color is very natural looking. I really like the color.My biggest problem - streaks. I really tried to apply evenly, which I thought would be easy with the towelette. But now I have a white streak down the side of one arm, and some patchy white spots on the other arm. Also whichever part you start with, will be darker since you get less tan as the towel dries.After this fades I will try again . . . but I won't be buying another pack of Tantowels."
5,BEST TAN THEY'LL NEVER KNOW IS FAKE,"These towelettes are AWESOME--give a flawless (and I mean flawless) deep tan without the mess. Better still, it doesn't clog your pores like lotions & mousses. You'll never go back to anything else after using these."
5,Freesia Fantasy,"Freesia Fantasy 8 oz Body SprayOf all the body sprays that I have tried, and beleive me I have tried alot, this one is by far the best one on the market. It has a nice mild floral scent to it, that lasts all day long. I like the fact that it does'nt have that strong cheap smell to it like alot of the other inexpensive perfumes have. And the best part is I get alot more compliments on this inexpensive perfume then I ever did using the expensive ones. Thankyou Body Fantasy.Shelley Skjei"
3,Gong - 'Live 2 Infinitea' (Snapper Music),"As big of Gong fan that I've been for sometime now,I'd honestly have to say that 'Live 2...' isn't all that great.Their studio disc 'Zero To Infinity' is better.Was recorded on the group's spring,2000 tour of the UK.One good thing is that sax/flute player Didier Malherbe is on this CD as you can hear his craft on most of the tracks.Daevid Allen and crew appear to be giving their all,as you can hear for yourself on ""Zeroid"",""Zero The Hero And The Witch's Spell"",the humorous ""Bodilingus"",""Tropical Fish"" and ""Selene"".STILL worth a place in your music collection,just may not get played all that often.Heard that 'OK Friends' is better.Nice packaging job,though."
3,Gong is...Gong!,"Made in UK in 2000, Serial#SMACD-834, Playing Time: 66 min.Daevid Allen's GONG has quite a unique musical style. This ""Live 2 Infinitea"" album was recorded live from 3 concerts performed in April 2000, and mostly focuses on the ""Zero To Infinity"" material.Musicians on the album are Allen, Smyth, Travis, Malherbe, Howlett, Taylor, and Gwyo Ze Pix on keyboards.The musicianship is high, but unless you enjoyed ""Zero To Infinity"", this is not the item to get acquainted with the band. The sound quality is great, so pick this one up if you're a fan."
3,Kind of pointless,"This is a live album from a tour to support the album Zero To Infinity. It is about 60 minutes long, and has excellent sound quality. The group features the Gong trio of Allen, Smyth and Malherbe plus Howlett on bass. There are additional musicians, notably a tenor saxophonist who dominates a number of the tracks.This album is pointless. It consists mostly of material from Zero To Infinity. None of the tracks are done that much differently than the previous studio versions. There are a few extended sax solos, but it isn't signigicant. The other tracks have already been covered on one of the many other live Gong albums.The music on this album is great. It is just all been done before on other albums.If you are considering buying this, get From Here To Eternetea instead. From Here to Eternetea is a double CD that contains both Live 2 Infinitea and Zero To Infinity and it is cheaper than a single CD."
4,what a product,"These cd-project items are great. They are cheaper then the other brands and they are just as good as the other names, but better. I have one that holds 104 and I love it, its so conveinant I can just leave it in my car and I don't need to lug around 3 different cd holders. I love this product."
3,A VERY SAD AND TRUE STORY,"A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO I DISCOVERED THAT I KNEW ONE OF THE VICTIMS OF THE MASSACRE. SHE WAS A YOUNG MOTHER, SHE HAD BEEN MY BRIDESMAID, I HADBEEN MARRIED TO HER BROTHER!! I WAS SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED AND FOUND THE BOOK AND READ IT. A TERRIBLE DEED IN THE DAYS OF INNOCENCE BEFORE THESEKINDS OF KILLINGS WERE KING OF COMMONPLACE. I'LL NEVER FORGET THE STORY OR HER."
5,BEST INFO AVAILABLE,THIS BOOK IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER SEEN IN HELPING WITH CARBOHYDRATE COUNTING AND ALL ELSE IT HAS TO OFFER!!!! THE SECTION ON DINING OUT IS VERY HELPFUL ALSO...A MUST HAVE!!!
3,Its okay,My daughter is a diabetic and this helps her when she is out. The print is a bit small but its okay.
3,Can't Review,I would give a review for this item if I could. But the person gave me a refund for the book so I can't review it. Sorry.
3,Poemas,If you like poetry you'll like this one. I happen to like poetry but I have to be in a certain kind of mood for this one.
5,The Great Aepps,"Allee Emerson Park Park and Schmidt. What can I say. These are the masters of ecology from the 1940s. If you want to know about the roots of ecology and what ecological scientists were thinking after the founding period (Gleason, Clements, Shelford) but before the modern era this is the book. Buy it, read it, cherish it. Put it on your shelf in a prominent location so that you can brag that you own it. One of my two copies sits on the same shelf as Shelford's Ecology of North America, DeVries Mutation theory, Fishers 1930 Genetical theory of natural selection. You get the picture.Of course, it was published in 1949. Our understanding has come a long way. This is now a book that you own for its historical insights. Much of what is in there is now dogma for modern ecologists.By the way, when I was a graduate students it was called ""the great AEPPS"" (i.e., the great ""apes"") because these authors were unquestionably THE authorities about ecology for their time."
5,excelente,"llego en excelente condiciones y al el tiempo requerido a mis niños les encanto, esta en excelente condiciones y a tiempo"
5,FINALLY - A BOOK FOR ME,"Jessica Weiner, where were you when I was a teen??Thank you for writing this book.For all of you who are on the fence of buying this book - know this:Her words come straight from the heart and will affect anyhone who has ever felt afriad or alone or not welcome in the world.As a mother I needed this but mostly as a woman I needed to hear your strength and laugh and cry with you.I highly recommend this book!"
1,There are MUCH better out there...,"Instead of a self-help book this is a ""help the author feel good about herself"" book. The focus on the students is interesting, but she would do well to limit her own stories. She even admits that the book was written to sell and to win her an appearance on Oprah."
1,Humm,This book comes across more as self promotion and less as self help. This book is full of pointless stories designed to make the author look good and short on real help for girls facing the trauma of having an eating disorder.
2,Good intentions are overwhelmed by shameless SELF PROMOTION,"While I do believe that Jessica has some intentions of helping people and doing good in the world, it is more believable her motivations stem from a lust for fame. Unfortunately, this book is completely bogged down by Ms. Weiner's overwhelming self congratulatory pats on the back. She will never let you forget that she is responsible for many small ""miracles"", that she is doing smart and specatacular social issue theater, that she changes the lives of young women everywhere... blah, blah, blah. Come on. It's just too much. I'd believe your work was important more easily if you weren't constantly telling me it is. Also, she paraphrases the enormous amounts of praise and worship her fans bestow upon her and somehow it all just reads as having come from Jessica's own mouth- again and again and again. This book should ultimately be called ""A Very Hungry Girl- a book about why you should think I'm great!""."
2,Recommend Instead,"Life Inside the Thin Cage by Constance Rhodes was a better book on the same subject, the tips it provides are less self promo seeming."
3,"Good, but not Best","This is not a bad book. I looked at it quite a bit when it first arrived, but I'm sorry to say I did not find anything too inspiring about the chosen works. Now it spends all of its time on my shelf. However, I get more out of a much smaller book at a much smaller price called Layout Index by Jim Krause. The Layout Index spends 90% of its time on my desk and inspires me regularly."
2,Hamilton watch,Not at all satisfied with this product. I had wanted a Hamilton watch for years and was dissapointed. The watch band was too short and rough. The syle was not attractive either.
2,From Good Tea (old style) to Strange Tea (this style).,"This ""newer"" Yogi product is very different from their old mix and is a big disappointment. (To me). It's hard to describe the flavor in what I got, but there is a distinct taste of something like the odor of fresh, moist dirt. I don't know if they got some tea from a different source, or what. The ingredients of both are identical. But this one is definitely unpleasant. I make sun tea with it almost exclusively. Their old style came in a maroon bag with a yellow square on it, and said ""Yogi Tea"" instead of just ""Yogi"". And, silly me, I bought a bunch of this thinking I would get exactly what I like and was used to. So, I'm sending this shipment back and going with the licorice and the ginger. So don't buy a large quantity like I did until it meets your expectations. My bad!"
2,"Come on Kayslay, what is this?","I bought Kayslays Pain From the Game about a week before it came out in most stores(my local cd store likes to sell their copies ahead of schedule;). I read that it featured production by Swizz Beatz, Kanye West, Eminem and the Heatmakerz. And as far as rappers go, most of the Shady/Aftermath camp is on here somewhere along with a ton of other big artists (fat joe, Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Scarface, Memphis Bleek and Prodigy, etc). So I expected this cd to be a big step up from the Streetsweeper Volume 1 mixtape (which I would give 3 stars at best). But for all the talent on this cd there's not many good songs. I thought the production was pretty weak. Some no name guy produced most of the cd but even the kanye west, swizz beatz and eminem tracks are pretty bland. If you have to have every song your favorite rapper or producer ever made, grab this disc. If your looking for good music leave this one alone."
2,don't waste your money,"This cd is not that hot at all. It has some killer collaborations but the production is straight weak. How you gonna put some of the illest mc's on some of the weakest beats? Your better off borrowing this , trust me."
3,Not Bad if you just want a cover for your ipod- otherwise forget it,"If you just want something to protect your Ipod--- YippeeHowever,The armband etc... is a joke.And to not use the little band to hang it around your neck. It's very flimsy. The metal piece comes off easily and your poor pod could go crashing down on the pavement."
1,Beware!,"I can testify that the new ipod classic 80gb click wheel will not work through a silicone cover. The click works the outer rotation wheel does not! Hence, the discount price for this design. I am not aware if this issue is amenable to a software update, but I wouldn't take the chance. This is a known issue."
5,Fantasyland,"The Tough Guide to Fantasy land by Diana Wynne Jones is a classic not only for readers, but a regular resource for writers as well. Now that Diana has died, it will be more valuable than ever."
4,Subtle sarcasm,"This is a very silly book. It's not for everyone. Basically, this book pretends to be a travelers' guide in order to sarcastically point out all of the clichés that we expect to occur in magical-fantasy novels. If you read a whole lot of campy fantasy novels, and/or are unable to not take them too seriously, then this information might be too much common knowledge to be enjoyable. Also, the author is British, which means the humor is very subtle.This book might be for you if you're the type who likes to read itemized encyclopedias that officialy define all of the people, places, and things of your favorite fantasy series du jour. The best use of this book, however, would be by prospective authors who wish to intentionally avoid writing yet another clichéd story. Note that everything in this book may also apply to D&D; adventures if you're so inclined (which makes sense if you consider D&D;'s inspirations)."
2,"Too much cliché, not enough funny","I like well written fantasy, and I loves me some biting comedy. I had very high hopes for 'The Tough Guide' as I figured it would scratch both itches, giving me a chance to cleanse the ol' literary palate before I moved on to a different genre.Sadly, I discovered that the wit was alltogether few and far between. Yes, the book does go on about various clichés that show up in a goodly portion of fantasy literature; the only problem with this is it was like having someone point to the screen during a showing of an Indiana Jones movie and tell you about the various pulp clichés - you either already know about them and thus just want the person to shut up so you can watch the movie, or you don't care in which case you just want the person to shut up so you can watch the movie.There were a couple of caustic bits that did have me giggle; three of them, now that I think about it.Funny books really need to be funnier than that."
4,Hilarious.,"The Tough... lost one star because I have hardly ever seen some of the ""cliches"", and some of the cliches that we often see are not listed. Common plot twists that we predict easily are not to be found here either. Some entries aren't that funny, and some are a little lewd, but this is still THE BOOK for fantasay lovers and fantasy authors. If you can't enjoy most of the book, you must be dreadfully boring. Read it!"
1,hyped up much?,"simply put, its just not as good as you think it will be. this book has a very childish nature to it, so if that's what you like then hey you will love this book."
3,Mildly amusing.,"This book is mildly amusing, but I found it annoying in spots. I haven't seen some of the things put forward as cliches done more than once--maybe I just don't read enough bad Tolkien imitations--and there are a couple I haven't read at all. Some of the choices of things to mock seem rather arbitrary, too--is a book about a strange land supposed to be improved by not having a map? I also note that certain people writing reviews don't seem to understand that the first time a thing is done, it isn't a cliche."
5,A must-read for fantasy fans,"Fantasies are full of cliches - even the best ones usually contain one or two elements that have been beaten to death in the genre. ""The Tough Guide to Fantasyland"" is the best book I've read making fun of these ubiquitous cliches. I laughed out loud at least once on every page. From the generic map on the first pages, to the explanations of why most fantasyland names have to contain apostrophes, to the *real* story of horse reproduction, nothing is safe from DWJ's clever wit. Prepare to venture into fantasyland with this guide - and don't forget to look out for the REEK OF WRONGNESS (Official Management Term)!"
2,Good writing + bad plot + tepid sex = disappointing book .,"There is no doubt that Ms. Welsh can write. Her characters are well drawn and likable and the plot (albeit a contrived one) is presented in a fairly realistic fashion. Too bad the sex scenes are so flat and lifeless. With a word like 'Romantic' in the title I was hoping for a little more emotional spark between the characters, but that proved not to be the case. The sex was a meaningless game to them. Still the end result did not turn me off enough to pass on anything else written by Welsh, I just hope to have better luck next time."
3,"Gets really hot, but sharp edges","I love using this for my backaches. It is difficult to use because the edges of te heart are very sharp and can really hurt. Its amazing how hot it gets and it feels great but I'm always a little tense when being massaged because I'm afraid of the sharp edges. Also, this is the second one I've owned, the first one popped when I boiled it for the first time.... dont know why. I didn't stab it or anything I just put it in the boiling water and realized it had popped when I pulled it out and it was half empty... anyways, its an okay product."
1,Poor quality,"This print-on-demand version is extremely poor quality. Type is visibly jagged, plates are so light as to be almost worthless. The entire book shows clear signs of lazy scanning and reproduction with no attempt to correct defects. The plates themselves are incorrectly paged with the images printed on the back side of the page.The entire book shows sloppy, lazy work with no concern for quality. No excuse for this sort of poor quality work. To argue, as some print on demand suppliers do, that low quality is inherent in the process is complete nonsense. If you were able to scan the book yourself or print from a PDF you would easily obtain better results. Even on a photocopy machine you would just hit ""darker"" after the first plate came out too light.I strongly recommend you seek out a PDF copy on the web and print it yourself.Inexcusably bad quality. DO NOT BUY unless you find it completely impossible to obtain the work any other way."
5,Right up there,"I have probably read this book more than any other in the series, and I enjoy it more each time. While the Misenchanted Sword is the primer, and Single Spell sets the tone for the rest of the novels, this book gives the best examples of all the varieties of magic in this world. It also has a likable character forced into extreme circumstances who uses brains he never knew he had. A real treasure."
5,All Corvettes Are Red,This is a great book. I recommend it to all Corvette and wanna be Corvette owners
3,"Good in parts, but tiresome in others","This book is really good at depicting the in and out, day to day struggles that go along with making a car. It is also, however, at times nothing more than a breathless fluff piece for Corvette. It seems that every chapter has at least a paragraph describing the raw sex appeal of a Corvette. That's fine to a point, but it got tiresome by the end including chapters devoted to Corvette lovers, their Corvette shows and museums (the chapters in this book are pretty short, though).The detail paid to the problems that came up was interesting and it's impressive to see all that goes on.I think a better car book is ""Car"" by Mary Walton that discusses the '96 Taurus. Better written and less gushing (but then, how much gushing could be done for a Taurus anyway?)."
1,Faint Print Paperback,This review isn't about James Schefter's story or writing. It's about the physical Pocket Books paperback version of the book itself. The print is so faint that it makes the book hard to read. The quality of the B&W photographs is worse than what you get if you try to copy a glossy photo print directly on an old copy (not scanner) machine.
5,All Corvettes are Red,This is a good read for anyone who loves Corvette!It is also an indepth view of the inner workings of GM who used to be #1.
3,"Good book, but not all that interesting for most people","If you own a C5 Corvette or have worked for GM or another car company, then this book is probably a good read. I own a C5 and enjoyed it pretty well, though it was not riveting (though it is factual so I can't blame the storyline). This book follows the entire creation of the C5 (fifth generation Corvette) and the many challenges faced by GM from the late 80s through the late 90s.After reading this book, it gave me a new respect for my car while at the same time lowering my respect for the C4."
4,Exactly as advertised,"This CD is exactly as advertised: The music and melodies were obviously written by Reb Beach, they'd fit in on any Winger album. But of course Doug's vocals are unique, giving it a slightly different flavor than Kip Winger. A few are pretty good, driving rock songs. A few are mediocre.The one exception to the rule is also the most outstanding track, ""The Magic."" Not Winger, not King's X, not Night Ranger. Just an amazing, powerful ballad. The melody and Kelly's vocals are simply outstanding, it gives me chills every time I listen to it."
3,the mob delivers,Not bad never got into Kings X but the singer is great.Reb beach always delivers his own style a must have!
3,Dug in Pop Metal?,"Yep, and for the most part, it works. Takes you back to like 1987 or so. I guess since Dug was doing other things like moving in a more progressive circle back then, he may felt that he missed out on the hair band, pop metal stuff. Hey, he can belt it out even in this format. It's good stuff, but this CD is rather hard to come by for some reason. Maybe distribution or something."
1,The Last Mass of the Knights Templars,"What a great add in the N.Y. Times! Now, if only the book lived up to the hype. The story has great promise, and the research is great. The last book I read that was written in this style, started of with ""See Spot run"". I hope if Ms. Long ever writes another book, it will be written for adults. You really have to want to read this book to wade through its poor prose."
2,Templar Disappointment,I was prepared for a rousing adventure in Templar history. Instead I was served up a poorly written tale. The verbage is child-like and too grammatically correct. The phrasing seems as though it was translated from another language and didn't make sense in English. The plot trods along and never builds to any excitement.
4,Modern Love Story,Nice modern love story set in Hong Kong/Tokyo. Story infuses the pursuit of riches with the search for one's true love. Must watch!
3,Review of the incorporation guide,"I liked this book. However, the first 45 pages is the best and, for me, the most important part. The rest of the book deals with the specifics of each individual state. So I only got 50 pages worth of valuable information."
1,Utterly useless,"The code in this edition in so-called C++ is just a copy-and-paste of the C edition code. All the functions have just been made members of ONE ""NR"" CLASS. The code presented brings none of the improvements that C++ could have brought. This turns this book into an ABSOLUTE RIP-OFF...Once again, this would only be useful for the explaination of the algorithms since the code in the C edition is a rather inefficient transcription of Fortran into C."
1,code in CD is not well written with a massive class for the,"The book is not much more useful than previous editions for Fortran and C in 1986 edition. The C++ code is written under a common class defination ""nr.h"" for the whole book, which is a very bad idea. The ""nr.h"" is massive, hard to examine any attributes, hard to be portable and visualize the code for each method. It is very bad idea!! It appears that the authors are trying to tie-up user to buy book and CD all together. The authors did not think for people to use it conveniently. It is not worth to buy the book and the CD. The code is not useful and you have to re-write them.If the Authors write the C++ code in such a manner that each method is self-contained, portable, easy to understand and use, it would be a different book and useful."
1,Get the C version,The source code is absolutely atrocious. The code is not object oriented and the low quality standards make it difficult to understand and actually use. I recommend the C edition because it makes it clear what every function requires and who allocated what.
3,context not included,Have only read over the first four chapters but so far the book seems to be little more than a print out of minimally commented source code with no context as to how/where/why one would apply the code or even explanations of what the code is doing. All code seen so far relies heavily on the included classes so the 'guts' of the recipe is not transparent with in the chapter. Sample user input and program output are not always listed with code but rather at the end of the chapter.Still may prove to be good reference.
2,"Buy ""Numerical Recipes in C"" instead of this book!","If you are considering buying this book because it is newer than ""Numerical Recipes in C"", don't! Virtually all the algorithms presented use a totally unnecessary ""NR"" class, which only serves to distinguish the ""C"" from the ""C++"" version of the book, and adds a complexity which you and I can live without. This is clearly the result of a ""publish or perish"" policy.""Numerical Recipes in C"" has all the same powerfull algorithms presented in a much clearer and simpler way.I purchased the ""C++"" version, and it was a mistake. At this point, I use the ""C++"" hardcopy for a refference only. I use the free online ""C"" version for code I can actually use.Don't buy this book! Buy ""Numerical Recipes in C"" instead!"
3,C++ Edition Is Not ++,"Virtually all code (with the exception of a rudimentary vector/matrix class library -- which, by the way, now features zero-based arrays, by popular demand) in the book is procedural, not object oriented. Thus, the title of the new edition is misleading, since the ""++"" features of C++ are not utilized.On the other hand, this is *the* classical recipe book for numerical techniques for a wide variety of applications, and is a ""must-have"" for anybody looking for a good reference for numerical algorithms.Bottom line: this edition will be just as useful as any of the other editions (C, Fortran, Pascal, etc) to a C++ programmer. If you are looking for numerical methods using object oriented programming, the only decent books to date are those by Daoqi Yang, and Barton & Nackmann (although the latter is a bit dated)."
2,"This book contains recipes in C piled together in one class, DON'T BUY","Book contains the same numerical procedures as in recipes in C piled up in one class. Using this book is like using C without exploitation of object capacities on C++.What I would recommend is to get the vector library Blitz++ and Numerical recipes in C; both are available for free on-line. Using Blitz++ you achieve speed of Fortran 90 and easy exposition of C++.And that's what author of this book should have done, write all the procedures based on blitz++.This book uses C++ only in its title."
3,Okay,"They product is okay for what it is but IF I would have paid attention to the information and read that it was only made of a foam like substance I would not have purchased it. The head of the flower pulls apart from itself and it looks ""cheesy"". I was hoping to display it all of the time and discuss it when it was asked about. Due to the way it looks, I probably will only bring it out during the weeks we plan to discuss plants. It would be better if it were made of a harder plastic."
1,flimsy,"This is a great model for learning the anatomy of a flower however it's too flimsy. Mine arrived with cracks and markings on it. I sent it back to amazon because I thought it was damaged due to inappropriate packaging, however when they sent me another one, it looked the same. The cross section is made of some type of ""cushiony"" material that doesn't take bending or other types of manipulation well. The item becomes cracked, the paint chips and the words become a little faded. The good news is that this model is one of the few if only ones poorly made; I also bought the volcano model and because the girth of the item is greater it does not bend and crack. Bottom line: this model will probably have a short lifespan with normal child play so - Save Your Money."
4,Very Good!,"A good source of information, especially about Indigenous Australians today. I'm quoting from it for my forth-coming book. It is particularly interesting as it includes Indigenous views about the arts, the traditions which they wish they wish to preserve. Great to see women editors too."
2,Cook's Broadway is a Yackfest,"We saw Cook on 60 Minutes and immediately ordered a couple of her CDs. The singing on this disc is as fine as we anticipated, but Cook's lengthy patter between songs renders the disc unusable for us as background music to conversation, meals, reading or work. Conversely, the recording represents well the experience of a concert performance by a singer who thinks people come to hear them talk excessively. We knew it was live when we ordered it, but no other live-performance discs in our library have such a low ratio of music to yacking."
2,A Music Fan Also,Am I the only one that is not rating this CD more stars? I was VERY disappointed in this CD. Too much talking by Ms. Cook took away from the whole recording. I must admit that I was unaware that it was a Concert Recording. Another disappointment was that it had no orchestra. Had I known that I would not have purchased it! She is still in fine voice and I will remain a fan of hers. Too bad this CD is a bummer.
4,"Love it, except. . .","Thank god this was not expensive and I was able to buy 2. The first one only lasted 3 days, something inside broke, but I had gotten 2 and the other curler is doing great, going on a month now and no problems with it. I really do love it."
4,Very Good,"I've had this eyelash curler before for quite a few years, but dropped it and it broke. If you are not looking to spend a lot of money this one is very good for the price - just be careful not to drop it!"
2,Breaks Easily,I've used this product for years but they seem to be making them not as sturdy. My last 3 have broken or stopped heating. :( I will have to find a new brand to try!
3,It's just ok,"I received this product within 5 days of placing my order so that was great! I don't really care for the product itself because it doesn't clamp down very well. You kind of have to finagle with it to get it to curl well. It does heat up enough to give a nice curl if you are able to get it to clamp. Overall, I probably wouldn't recommend this product because it just doesn't work the way it's supposed to."
3,Tips!! ( not worth buying it ),"Instead of buying this product here's a tip, just take ur eyelash curler and warm it up by using a blow dryer and blowing the hot air on it! Same result at no cost:)"
1,Does not work,"What else is there to say? I have a different brand of heated eyelash curler that works fine. This one is flimsy, and when you squeeze the pad to the upper rim in order to curl your lashes, the two don't meet right and no curling happens. Lousy product."
2,Worked a few times...,It worked a couple of times. The battery connection doesn't work well. The signal light stopped working after a few uses. Won't buy again.
5,Get this for great lashes,I love this I recommend this if ur looking for curled lashes fake or real it works reall good i told my friends family they all love it I would defy buy this again if mine breaks :).
1,For toothless poodles only,This toy is absolutely worthless if your dog has teeth. The black mesh on the sides came apart within 20 minutes of play and there was stuffing everywhere.
1,Cheap as S&**,My small beagle sized dog received this as a gift for x-mas. Before handing it over to him I felt like it was pretty tough and that it would last him several months. He has destroyed in less than an hour. He had a toy frog that I got him from Marshall's that lasted months and this thing lasted an hour? Makes no sense. A total waste of money for the person who purchased it for him.
2,Tuff Stuff?????,"This was a cute and attractive toy. The bottom part of the toy is covered in a very durable fabric, but the top, that is the fuzzy head, is not durable at all. It came apart within two days of play and I had white stuffing all over my house to clean up. The rope came off easily. The bottom part stayed in tact. My dog is an enthusiastic player and loves toys that squeak. She is a Blue Heeler / Lab mix of about 55 lbs. I thought this toy might last longer, but it did not. Do not recommend for medium to large dogs."
1,Waste of money,This toy is a waste of money and it is false advertisement. My dog had this toy destroyed within 20 minutes of playing with it. The rope handle come off almost immediately and then the next thing I know the stuffing is all over the place. Don't waste your money on this toy.
1,Not made for chewers!,"Like other reviewers, my puppy had this toy destroyed in under 10 minutes. Fuzzy hair and stuffing was everywhere. I do not recommend this toy for chewers!"
2,not durable,this toy is not made for chewers. it fell apart a week after i gave it to my 2 yr old dog.
1,False Advertising,Bought this for my dog and he had the stuffing out in about 5 minutes. I have given my dog stuffed animals out of claw games that are more durable. Don't buy this item. I would recommend a Kong Wubba. Those toys are tough and are similar to this item.
1,NOT tuff at all,"Hey, I bought one of these today because I thought it looked cute, and it claimed to be good for ""tuff"" chewers.Well, my 7 month old Dobie mix (with all adult, not puppy teeth) had the stuffing out in 5 minutes!Now, I have to add that while her breed is noted for being aggressive chewers, she has plenty of other toys that have lasted months before wearing out, or haven't worn out yet.So while this product looks and claims to be durable - it is NOT. Buyer beware."
2,Going back to KoKo and YumYum,"Our cat-ty author of KoKo and YumYum-solved mysteries deviates from her norm by introducing her readers to several other crafty feline stories, each introducing us to a new hero or heroine. Stories range from typical mysteries to eerie ghost stories, to one really odd story about a robot alien cat. Yeah.While I appreciated the effort, and while some stories made me laugh or smile (because I love kitties), the space alien one was a bit ""far out"" (haha) for me, and there were several that made me downright sad. Kitty lovers, beware! A few of these stories have less than happy endings for the cats, which made them somewhat hard to get through. Something I thought would be light reading turned out to be not so by the time I was done. I'm looking forward to going back to KoKo and YumYum's silly antics."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I have been reading Ms. Braun's ""The Cat Who ... "" series of mysteries featuring Jim Qwilleran, Koko, and Yum Yum. After reading (and loving) the first 6 of them, I decided to read this collection, which is apparently a collection of Ms. Braun's early work, collected and re- published after her series became popular. I was disappointed because this collection isn't nearly as good as the series. I wouldn't say it's bad, just not good. The stories for the most part are predictable. Like that other reviewer, I believe that if you are a fan of ""The Cat Who ... "" series, you will be disappointed in this collection."
1,The Cat Who Had Little To Say,"While I am addicted to the Cat Who series and wish only that there were some that I had not yet read, 14 Tales was a great disappointment. I found it overly sentimental and cloying. There were few stories that seemed worthy of Ms. Braun's time and talents as a writer. The great strength of Ms. Braun's books is her hero Jim Quilleran and the amusing cast of characters who inhabit his world. Picking up a new Cat Who (or rereading one already read) is something like revisiting an old friend. There is no such sense in the Tales. It is the only work of Ms. Braun's to which I would not wish to return."
4,Neat little tool,I bought one of these at micro center a few days ago. It can burn holes through soda cans. the only complaint is that is goes through lighters fast.
4,Classic,"One of my faves from Mr. Poe, always loved it. Just got my Kindle a couple days ago, so all this is new to me. But I enjoyed this."
4,Classic,It's no surprise - I love Poe in general - if you are a fan then you will love this classic story.
3,Good read.,"My daughter is reading a lot of Poe this semester in school; I thought I should read a few just to keep up. I actually read this when I was around the same age as her, but having suffered more loss in the years between then and now; I guess it means a little more now.Read it! It's not very long..."
1,Classic and Boring,"I enjoy classics but this one was boring, and not a dark and weird as I was hoping it would be."
4,"Fantastic poem, ridiculously long intro","E. A. Poe's poem is fantastic. ""Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore'"", is one of the most famous lines in history. However, there is an absurdly long intro that literally takes up about three-fourths of the book. I only took away one star because you can quickly get to the poem by searching or 'Go To'ing the location, 217, but it's ridiculous that they have an intro longer than the poem itself. Still a great, haunting poem though!"
3,"No Illustrations, No Table of Contents","The Good:It's free. It's Edgar Poe.The Bad:No illustrations. The description clearly states that it is illustrated by Édouard Manet. While I don't need the illustrations to appreciate the work, I was curious what his visual interpretation of it was.No table of contents. It would be nice to have a link to the work so I didn't have to page through ~80% (which is someones commentary on the work) of the book."
3,The Raven,"hes very good at rhyming ill give him that, but he goes on and on about one thing! hes needs get on with it."
3,grea book but.......,"its a good book but it has the LONGEST intro in the whole world. it contains 90% intro, and only 10% story (literally). Its a good book but just the intro is the problem"
4,Raving About 'The Raven',"Cliched as it may be, this is indeed a timeless classic. Nobody writes like Poe, he is in a category all by himself and The Raven is one reason why. I am loving it over and over all over again."
1,Not my read.,"Not at all what I expected, I found it hard to consentrate and follow the theme. I can not recall a book that I found as tedious as this one."
4,Modern English would help,I am still enjoying this book which I last read about 60 years ago. Some of the english terms used by the author are no longer in my lexicon. A modern day English version would be well received I believe.
5,Classic,"Its The Raven, the classic poem by Edgar Allan Poe. Its funny, its witty, its fun to read aloud, its memorable and its been rendered on The Simpsons which makes it extra awesome."
1,Avoid this version!,"This document starts out with random verses of the poem in no particular order followed by an analysis of the poem-- which I did not read and therefore cannot give a fair review. Then the actual poem in full is 61 percent into the document. Very poor edition. Avoid this one and download a different one, if available. Otherwise just find the poem online or pay the dollar for the collection."
4,Raven,Read this for a love who love's the work's of Poe....I did enjoy..I shall keep this...for its one of his favorites...
3,I'm sure a better version is available,"I wanted to reread The Raven and so downloaded this book. The good news is it does have the entire poem--which I read and enjoyed. The bad news is I had to page through 66% of the manuscript (to location 271) to find it. The first two thirds is a commentary which I cannot fairly review as I did not read it. Finally after the poem are a number of poorly formatted pages with mostly just numbers and snippets of the poem. All in all a very poor edition of a very great work.There are a few other free editions available, I plan to delete this one and try the others."
3,wow:(,"i downloaded this book thinking i would be able to read the whole poem, but all i got was just snippets of the poem. for people who want to ALL of the poem, this is not the book."
3,"New edition, now with correct typesetting","[Note: This refers to the eBook only.]The ebook has been updated and now the typesetting is sensible. The poem is there, and is quite readable. It is preceded by a lengthy commentary, which may or may not be of interest.Note that the illustrations are still omitted, but lines mark their absence in the text, jarring the flow somewhat.The poem is now quite readable, but could still be presented better."
5,it served its purpose,I love Edgar Allen Poe and all this writings so I loved that this was available for free for my kindle
2,The Raven,It was okay.. I was very confused by the beginning but as soon as I started reading the poem I began to understand so much more clearly...
4,Classic,Writing isn't the same anymore! Poe was a beautiful poet! I forgot how wonderful poetry was! I must continue to read it!
2,Understand,"Maybe it's me. Maybe it's way too ""out there."" I read it twice. Asleep by page seven. Thus, an excellent book, for insomniacs."
5,The Raven,Classic! Don't miss out especially when it's free! I highly recommend this book to everyone. My personal favorite for sure.
5,great classic,"poe need I say more, get it read it, i hate this amazon review minimum word requirement , i hate this amazon review minimum word requirement"
5,"Easy Read, Still Beautiful","I love that Poe is easy to interpret, but still makes you think a bit about his reads. This one in particular requires a little knowledge of mythology and a wider vocabulary, but that just filters out the type of people who could ruin great works like this one."
5,Literature from my high school years,Edgar's The Raven was a poem we read in high school literature. It was symbolism at it's best. Darkness of depression seems to be the cause of the Raven's appearance in the poem. Edgar character's mindset in the poem was filled with depression. The lost of a loved one best describes his grief. Dark but worth reliving or reading for the 1st time.
3,Comment on format,"I love ""The Raven"" and I'm not so much rating the poem as I am the format. The format, for me at least, makes it harder to read. But that's the only issue I have with it."
2,Good,"Good copy and notes on the classic work.Shows the views of interesting minds, with thorough study. I really enjoyed."
3,"Great for the basics, but ...",... it's not about riding the cutting edge. You've got to learn the rules before you can break them with impunity. And this book is all aobut the rules.
3,Could of been better,"I will not go into reviewing the content of the movies themselves, but rather the quality of the DVD.AMC Monsterfest is a known name, so I expected a little better quality.The video looks OK. It is definitely watchable, but I have seen clearer transfers.The audio in White Zombie fluctuates a little in volume.The audio in the Ape Man is a bit muffled.The devil Bat is the best transfer on here-both visual and audio.The last 7 minutes or so of the Human Monster has no audio. It just cuts out, and does not come back. I have not seen any other version of this movie, so I am not sure if this is normal because of the age and condition of the film.That is the major complaint with this DVD.The creepy music on the menu screens is very cool.For less than $10, it is probably worth it.There are so many Bela Lugosi collections to choose from, you just don't know which are the better ones to get. How many times are you willing to buy the same movies to find out?"
4,Looked great But was LATE!!,costume was better than I could have guessed but was shipped late arriving 3 DAYS AFTER HALLOWEEN!!!!!!!! gaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh I wanted to ask for my money back but ill just have to use it next year i guess
2,Cheap materials + poor foot design,"Not too pleased with this product: the opening for the face was too small so I had to partially rip the seam, the material is kind of 'burlap-y' and I don't even know what I was supposed to do with the feet. There is no opening on the bottom, so I guess you could just wear shoes inside the costume (although it seems like it would get very dirty and rip like that) but there is not enough room to fit a sneaker in. I had to cut holes."
5,"Great Introduction to ""longer"" stories for little ones.","Most of the stories in this book are about 100 pages long. For each page of text there is a beautiful, Disney-worthy illustration. The stories are the classic triumphs of good over evil that the Disney generations grew up with.The stories are split into chapters, which is a nice introduction to longer stories for little ones. I thought that my three year old might be too young for this type of book, and that I would save it until she is older. I was wrong.I am currently working my way through the book with my 3.5 year old. She knows that she will hear one and sometimes two chapters per night, and then have to wait for more. She is very interested in the stories and loves looking at the illustrations.I can't think of a better way to introduce discussion about ""what will happen next"" than stories that are divided into chapters. I can't think of a more pleasant bedtime diversion than this book."
5,keoni - Arkansas,"This is a wonderful book. I recommend it to everyone. It teaches you about choices and how to deal with life as well as telling the wonderful story about Samson and Baby Sister. I knew Dr. Brunell, unfortunately only for a short time, but I consider myself fortunate to have known her and will always treasure the time I spent with her."
3,Book,Needed it for school the want to charge me $150.00 for a out dated book not!!!! just wish it was up dated.
5,Very comfy,"Love deep green color, nice soft fabric nice weather resistent learned quickly after adding to hammock same day had 2 days of down pour rain. Pillow resisted water nicely and dried quickly. Only thing is mount is different than photo shows no eyelets on current pillow. Actually had 2 Velcro straps sewn on back of pillow which still works nicely as mounting is more versitle anywhere on hammock. Very nice pillow overall"
1,I do not recommend this book - too general.,"I was very disappointed with this book. It was too general and provided very few ratings, which is especially disappointing since it is Consumer Reports. You would be better off buying Baby Bargains by Denise & Alan Fields. It is much more detailed and helpful. Lots of ratings and detailed information."
2,addressed to readers of the customer reviews,"The ""reader from Tarrytown, NY"" is not expecting her first child in a few months. She's an employee of Consumers Union, who happened to market the book. She already has two small children and is not expecting anymore at the present time. It's not fair and ethical to write a review for it. Let the book stand/fall on its own merits."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book was not informative at all. I started to read the reviews after I bought the book just to make sure I was not the only one who was not impressed with the book. I took the suggestion of other readers and bought Baby Bargain. Now this is a wonderful book. I can't put it down, originally when I bought I was planning to just skim though and read what I thought was important but the advice was so good that I had to start reading the book from the beginning to make sure I wasn't missing out on any good tips."
5,"Good, but... There's a better resource","Briefly put, this book is fine, but too general. I buy Consumer Reports for cold, hard facts. This book more closely follows their Buying Guide format, rather than their magazine format. If you want generalities, this buok is fine for you. If you want real-world experience with the latest baby products, with a heaping helping of practicality and common sense, check into ""Baby Bargains"" by the Fields. Their book sure cleared up the confusion for this soon-to-be first-time dad!"
4,A wonderful resource; take the book with you when you shop.,"While people have been disappointed that this book doesn't have ""enough"" product recommendations, it provides an even more valuable service to parents -- it tells them how to THINK about the purchases they make. The CPSC website shows that millions of infant products are recalled each year. As infant product companies are under pressure to put more and more products onto the market at greater speeds -- testing is taking a back seat. Not until thousands of babies are using the product in their homes or daycare centers, do the companies learn the product is defective. By then it's too late, since many people never hear about the recall. Pay close attention to Jones's last chapter on recalls -- she explains how these products are tested. This is the most important chapter in this book."
1,Not much information,"There is not much information in this book. It is more general info about buying products, not detailed analysis of specific products that I expect from the magazine article"
1,Do not buy,"I cannot stress strongly enough how much you do not want to buy this book. I don't think that I could give this copy that I bought away! I bought it to buy baby products, starting with a simple crib and carseat. I was more concerned about how the brands ranked...unfortunately the writers of this book were not. The good thing that they did offer were tips on how to select a good crib/stroller/carseat/etc. So if you want the how tos on buying this is a good reference. If you want the ""what to buy"" stay away.I went out and bought the book ""Baby Bargains."" I found it extremely useful in telling you the history of brands and rating them all clearly on a A to D scale. However that book wasn't very helpful in tips on how to check for a sturdy crib, or strong carseat."
1,Disappointed Consumer Reports fan,"I rely on Consumer Reports constantly for my purchases, so I was very disappointed at how little useful information this book contained. There are very few ratings and lots of too general information. Consumer Reports, fix this - parents need your advice on how to avoid spending a bundle on baby!And, I agree - buy the Baby Bargains book instead."
3,"Some good info, but could be better","With a name like Consumer Reports on the cover you would expect LOTS of DETAILED reviews...but you'd be wrong. Brands are limited to just the few top-selling and oftentimes don't have any detail. Sometimes CR magazine can give too much detail, but with this book, it's too little. Some info. is actually incorrect: ""use refrigerated breast milk within 48 hours after pumping."" Studies over two years ago determined this to be seven days! Overall category discussions, tips, and advise are very good. But, you would expect with a whole book devoted to one category, it s/b better."
1,No RATINGS == Useless Book,"The only reason I wanted this book to see the comparison for safety of car seats, strollers, play pens, etc. Instead, what I found was a shopping list of infinite length, and almost no ratings. Only 5 car seats were rated, 2 of which are no longer made. This, after at least 15 styles of car seats were discussed as ""potential options"" in the body of the book. I am very disappointed, and plan on returning this book. Don't bother with it... you can find the shopping lists that the book provides at Amazon.com's lists, and this adds no value at all."
3,IT'S COOL,THE PICTURE REMINDS ME OF A PRINT FROM KINKOS ON A LEGAL SIZE PIECE OF PAPER. LOOKS NICE IN A FRAME.
1,Sepultura died when Max left,"Sepultura has not been the same since Max left the band. They dont have that power with derick green. It is an insult that they still perform some of the lyrics from max like Spit, Bloods bloody roots,etc. Dont buy this album it is better if you get max last performance with sepultura which is call Live under a pale gray sky."
5,Do Not Sleep On This CD,"This is my new favorite cd. You can listen to almost every single track on this cd. Tim has done it once again and a clear genius. Magoo lyrics are alot better. Even the the two tracks, number 6 Produced by J Nitti and track 15 Produced by Heavy D are excellent, this song they should release as a single. To bad every Cd that I buy can't have this type of quality. This Cd will make up for the cd's you bought that disappointed you."
2,I cant believe I waited this long for this!!!!,"This cd reminds me why I burn or buy bootleg cd's. This is the worse cd ive bought in my life(yes really). If you like those creative beats that timbo makes so well u really wont find them on this one.The beats don't even sound like tim made them they just sound plain and lame. Track 6 is the only one that caught my ear while going through the cd (for those of you who like beats more than lyrics), but thats one thing I cand give tim props on is his lyrics has step up a bit on this one and for magoo well....anyway.For those who want somthing to bump in their car this cd is definitely not for u. Just about every hook on there is pretty much wack (track 5 is ok). I know people have their own taste or whatever but a 5 out of 5 is just damn rediculous. Im just trying to help people not to go out there and waste 10-17$ and end up breaking the cd case like I did. ""Still Underconstruction"" sounds more like it."
3,Seems Like Something Is Missing,"This CD is fairly good when looked at individually but when you compare it to their previous efforts it is very lack luster. The largest flaw is that all Timberland & Magoo CD's to date have been more or less party music with plenty of very creative beats. This album while still maintaining the creative and unique beats isn't very party oriented, with only 4 of what I would call party songs. If this is going to be your first Timberland & Magoo cd purchase try ""Indecent Proposal"" first because every song is great. Underconstruction Part II is missing the classic blow up your stereo style of their past efforts."
2,Needs More Construction....,"Production is not everythingTimbaland and Magoo have never been supreme lyricists, we all know that. Their forte is that good ol party music, of which their is not much on this cd. There are some nice attempts but when u actually hear it i cannot see myself gettin hyphee when this comes on at a party. I really don't have much more to say. Diehard fans will enjoy, non die hard fans will remain that way. Those who hate timb and magoo...will see this as nothing but justice for their feelings. Sad to see Timbaland put out something as mediocre as this b4 he ""retires"". I always hear him talking about how boring the game is now...he has made no attempts to spice it upFavorite Tracks...#10 Into The Music#03 Shenanigans (Bubba Sparxx spit the best verse on teh whole album)HOLLA EAST OAKLAND IN THIS B!TCH"
3,NOT QUITE WHAT I SUSPECTED,I WAS THINKEN DIS CD IS GON BE HOTT. N I WAS HOPIN IT WAS OGN BE HOTT LIKE HIS BEATZ BUH ITS OKAY YET SO ITS A OKAY CD 2 LISTEN 2... SO I SUGEST U BUY IT..
1,FEINSTEIN HE'S NOT,"I was so impressed with Mr. Gaines' performance in the Jerry Herman Hollywood Bowl tribute, I ordered both of his CD's, wondering (at the time) why they were apparently out-of-print. Now I know. While he has the voice of a Broadway singer, he has the taste and mannerisms of a SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE-level lounge singer, indulging in every whim from extending lines, to glottal whispers to late-Sinatra-type interior exclamations. If you like Lounge/Cabaret Jazz singing, he's fine. If you want to listen to the songs the composers wrote, go elsewhere. This one goes straight to the Consignment Shop."
1,If I had only read RANDOLPH W DELLAGO'S review first,I made the same mistake as RANDOLPH W DELLAGO after hearing this singer on the Hollywood Bowl show honoring Jerry Herman. I agree with every thing Mr Dellago said in his review.
4,Very Convenient To Use,"The small, pocket-sized container is great. It's got a seal that wouldn't break under pressure, so you don't have to worry about it accidentally breaking open in your pocket, and yet it's easy to open when you want to.It has an unusual flavor. It's probably the herbs. It's not a bad flavor, but because it is so salty, it's not really a good flavor either.There are two things I would like to see, either here on the product information page and/or in some literature that comes with the package: Some information about why salt gargling works. I'm curious.The other thing is that I think this idea of a single, well-sealed packet you can carry with you would be great for a mouthwash too. I think that would sell very well.All-in-all, if you want an easy-to-carry packet of salt gargle solution, this is perfect for you."
4,Could Use Some Flavoring,"Walking dogs in freezing weather the last couple days hasn't been that good on the immune system and my throat started to get a little tingly so I figured it would be a good time to try a Simply Gargle Salt Water Rinse. It is as easy as you imagine it would be, twist off the cap and pour into your mouth. The instant taste is definately something to get used to and lives up to the salty title. But at least the aftertaste doesn't last that long. Five minutes and I forgot all about how it tasted. Other than the taste, my biggest complait is that it is harder than you think to gargle for the recommended 15-30 seconds. But the good news is the tingle is gone. The package itself seems durable enough that you can throw some in your pocket or purse and not worry about it ruptuting unless some blunt trama. Very useful if you are one to not let a cold keep you in bed and are still on the go."
2,"Neat idea, but","The idea to sell prepackaged gargles is a great idea, especially if you are pressured to go to work despite being sick. Moreover, brine solutions like this are prone to bacterial contamination once opened, so it makes sense to package them in individual use containers. When this product arrived I happened to have a sore throat so I tried the product a few times. The individual solutions are the perfect volume for gargling, however, the packages are extremely difficult to open. They seem more designed for shipping and inexpensiveness than for ease of use. The gargles taste pretty good, but they seemed pretty weak from a saltiness perspective. Unfortunately, it did not help my sore throat at all. I followed this experiment with a gargle of my own preparation: the standard saturated warm water/table salt that moms always recommend. The latter did the trick immediately. In conclusion, I say stay home from work and make your own salt solutions, you'll be happier that you did."
1,Money to Burn,"I used to mix table salt with tap water, but why do that? It's almost free! I discovered this product, which I can pay much more for! Instead of being subjected to imprecise measurements and the whims of tap water, I can now pay through the nose, if I so desire. What with inflation and the fall of the dollar, I'm always looking for ways to throw away my money. Thanks, Simply Gargle Salt Water Rinse!"
4,Convenience is the benefit,"As others have mentioned, this product tastes a bit strange and takes a bit of getting used to. The major benefit is that you can strategically leave some salt water gargle in places you frequent, like your office and your car, for times when you feel a sore throat coming on and would otherwise have to wait until you got home to do something about it.A great product to have during cold and flu season!"
1,Simple salt water will be a better choice,"In general, I strongly advocate warm salt water for oral hygene. So, I sampled this product. I am not pleased with the additional (unnecessary) ingredients added to simple salt water, as they created an unwanted flavor and taste. I really do not know if they have any value add in terms of health and hygene. The sachet is not easy to open. I feel sad that so much of plastic waste is generated for such a simple purpose. I wish the company used bio-degradable packaging. I am not ready to pay a lot of money for such a simple solution and little convenience. I would personally use simple, warm salt water."
4,"worthwhile, useful, and also great before church","Yes, the little packets are a bit hard to open (but better that they don't leak). But I find them most convenient; I also find them effective for making the throat feel much better when a cold's coming on. The mixture tastes herbally medicinal but is not offensive. I found that I had to learn how to gargle properly, but that comes with a few times' practice.I find that my singing voice in church on Sunday morning is much stronger if I gargle one of these beforehand. Overall, I recommend these and intend to get more for myself."
3,Handy and compact...it's a gargle in a packet.,"The question most people have is: What does it really do and will it work? Well, everyone has gargled with salt water before at the hiint of a sore throat, and this has that and added things. As a friend of mine who tried a packet put it, ""It is the gnarliest thing she ever put in her mouth"". As in...she thought it tasted horrible. Another person I let try it said it helped his sore throat. I personally think it works ok...it does taste...different, but if I have a sore throat and want some relief if I'm at work, this fits the bill. I like the packets, which allow you to have sore throat relief in your desk or car. I'd like to see how they fare when you have a nasty sore throat. So far, not bad at all, if you don't mind a funky gargle in a packet."
4,Soothing and convenient,"Some have complained about the strange taste of these porta-packets of throat ease gargle. Personally, I found the flavor to be tolerable - a definite salt water base but with scattered, pleasant notes of herbal essences lingering throughout.This past weekend I awoke to a hoarse and irritated throat after shouting most of the previous night at a football game and actually looked forward to putting this product to the test. Lo and behold I found that this gargle rinse did help to soothe my throat. Later that night I used it again before retiring to bed. I am pleased to report that I awoke the next morning with a throat back to normal.The best thing about these packets is the sheer convenience. The compact, efficient design makes for easy storage in your glove-compartment, backpack, purse, etc. I definitely will carry a few with me during the cold season."
3,Not,"First of all, I should say that I hate rinsing with salt water. I thought I would try this product though because rinsing your mouth with salt water is very good for you, especially since I sing so much; because of my singing I thought it would help my throat out. With this in mind I tried this product.I liked the fact that it included Vitamin C, and other herb extracts to help sooth the throat, that attracted me to it, however it was those very things that made my gag reflex go when I used it. Now, keep in mind I hate salt water, but it was not only the salt water that made me gag, but also the taste of the witch hazel (which does not taste good). I would probably recommend this to people who regularly rinse with salt water, but certainly not to people like me who cannot stand a super salty taste mixed with herby favors and witch hazel.God Bless ~Amy"
5,Great book!!,"This book is great! I have a problem with understanding instructions - the author includes plenty of photos (without them I'd get nowhere) to make the process simple. I love the bright colors and designs she uses, too.She includes a variety of techniques, and applications ranging from placemats to large rugs. It opens up a whole range of ideas - but most important, this gives a good starting point, with very clear instructions for the beginner like me. In fact, I loved it so much I bought another book by the same author."
1,No percussive effect = did not do the job,"What prompted me to buy it was a 3"" diameter pipe which spilled over every time when the washing machine discharged its waste water. It still spills over and below I described why.I bought this bladder, based on excellent rating, and thinking that so many Amazon users cannot be wrong. I previously attempted using Cobra bladders sold by Lowes, based on another faulty recommendation. This makes me wonder whether any of these users know how a bladder like that is SUPPOSED to work. This is well illustrated on the YouTube video ""Does It Work ?? Drain Bladders"" by HandyGuyKattermann available here:[...]Bladder like that should generate a ""percussion effect"" blasting the clogs by repetitive hammering. However, the Drain King bladders just spill a continuous thin stream; and as they fill up, they spray a wide aerated cone instead (similar spray to what one gets from a shower) therefore, these bladders do not work for partial clogs."
2,Irresponsible IMHO,"There are parts where the author feels that so long as he doesn't name actual names, he can lie and say whatever he wants about groups/people, based on negative hearsay from somebody he interviewed. He could easily have taken a little effort to contact the parties in question to at least verify whether was being said about those parties was accurate -- or even had any basis in truth at all -- or not, before writing it down. If that is the fellow's methods of research, interviewing or investigation, I advise him to not quit his day job. I highly recommend ignoring this book. Go out and rent a movie or something."
3,An Amusing Read,"This book wasn't half bad. It was quite amusing to hear about this group of people. Some of them are quite believable, while others seem delusional. I know Victoria says that ""Malcolm"" is really her girlfriend, however, he was an actual person. Her girlfriend came into the picture a few weeks later. I found it interesting to discover about a subculture that I knew existed, but was never close enough to to gather information on. All in all, it was a quite fascinating read."
2,"Yeah, yeah. Nice bedtime stories.","Chocked full of interesting stories. I'm not a firm believer of 'vampires', but it does hold my interest for more than an hour per day."
5,This is for the one that feels this forum is to slam ppl...,"Victoria here again.I am not here often but to come here and see sa forum designed to rate a book used by someone to slam me personally is sad.Sad they have nothing beter to do. But to get the story straight I am not lying and have much evidence to proof this.'Malcom"" and I began seeing each other months before my interveiws,in fact they wanted to talk to her but she declined.That was her choice to not have the chance to be with me in this book.If anyone needs proof then contact me instead of hding on this forum as a flamer.Enough said...this place is for book reveiws and I will not ssay another word on the subject of this jealous flamer.^V^"
5,Half-Life: Counter-Strike,"This game is awesome because it has good graphics, good gameplay, awesome levels and environments, cool weapons (real world weapons), and it sort of has a chatroom after you die."
5,A religion could be made out of this game.,"Oh my lord (Counter-Strike, that is), I beg of you to let me frag a few cheaters with the M4A1. Ok, sorry about that. Anyway, Counter-Strike is one of those games that lets you experience real world battles with GET THIS -- REAL GUNS. Ever heard of the AK-47? Its in there. The MP5Navy? Its there too. Oh, and lets not forget the all powerful AWP Sniper Rifle Magnum. If you need something to do, or if your life is already too busy, then get off your uh.. seat.. that.. uh.. you're.. uh.. sitting.. on.. and GET THIS GAME. (...) Have fun boyz and girlz.. happy fraggin'!"
3,ok......,well...what bothers me is the graphics. i know this is a very old game....but still ick the graphics are really bad actually....the graphics are similar to some early playstation games ive played...man i cant stand it.
1,Why?,Why would anybody pay money for this when you can buy HALF-LIFE for 20 bucks and download it for free along with hundreds of other mods. TFC and DoD are much better anyway. Save yourself the money and buy Half-Life instead.
4,This game is good for tactical multiplayer,"This game is the best multiplayer tactical fps of all time...very realsitic, but dont lisiten to the people who say you cant use a 56kmodem for performance, it runs fine just a LITTLE jerky.So....I reccomend a pentium450mhrz geforce2.....3d highquality sound card..........cable or dsl..........128mbram....aboutit that is.And for pentium2300mhrz I reccomend geforce3,4or radeon8500.I reccomend this game."
3,Its A Great Game......If You Have A Connection!!,"Yes, this is a great game if you like team playing shooting games. But if u dont have a connection of 56k or lower FORGET IT! I have this game and I also run on a 56k modem and it takes me forever to get into a game and when i do most the time im really laggy. If i could get cable or dsl i would enjoy this game much better. I still try to play it because its a great game and its addicting, but if u have 56k or lower i would think of not buying it because it will just make u very angry trying to play it, trust me! :)"
5,Nice Game,Counter-Strike is an awesome game enjoyable by all types of people as indicated by the over million people that play it.
4,Anybody who dosent own this game please READ!!!!!!,"I'll say it straight this game is amazing, except selling it is stupid, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!! Because it is out of date and you can download the full version at www.counter-strike.net so do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Best Half-Life Mod,"Well, like I said, it is the best Half-Life Mod. But don't buy it, download it. The only reason I would buy this game is if I had a slow connection like a 56k modem. Even then, gameplay is going to be a little bit choppy and you are going to be at a slight disadvantage to the rest of us with cable and DSL service. But back to the game, It has a very innovative idea being once you die, you are dead (for that round). Rounds usually last around 5 minutes or until everyone from one team dies. Speaking of teams, there are two of them, terrorists and special forces teams (like Rainbow Six). Unfortunately there is only one type of gameplay though, cops rescue hostages. That is it. I like the game as a whole but if you haven't been playing it for the last year then you are going to get tore up by those of us who have been playing. Good luck to those who try this game and happy fragging."
5,BUY ME,alright first of all im 15 not 13 also id like to say this is the best game ever created. i was reading other reviews where people hated it cause its not mario and that people who play this have no lives. Well i play this and still have a life. hundreds of thousands of people play this actually and the average pc gamer considers it the greatest multiplayer game ever. great maps great weapons addictive gameplay. go to a lan house and play to try i guarantee u will be hooked and if you hate this game then u must be back in the atari 2012930 or whatever the frick it is. this game is great ok YESYESYES i know the graphics arent GROUNDBREAKING but who cares it super entertaining and if the graphcis really suck its ur PC because it is great. AND LASTLY WHOEVER SAYS THIS GAME SUCKS GOTO A LAN HOUSE OR GO ONLINE AND TALK TO THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT PLAY IT YES MILLIONS
1,"Great Game, But I'll Get to the One Star","Counter-Strike is a spectacular mod for a spectacular game. Half-Life, though somewhat outdated now, is still one of the best FPS games ever made. The gameplay is superb, and the mods that have spawned from the game are great in their own right. Counter-Strike is one of those great mods. Counter-Stike is so great, that Sierra decided to sell a retail version of the game. This is why I am giving this only one star, in spite of the spectacularness of the game. Go to pretty much any website where games can be downloaded, and you can get this game, provided you have Half-Life, for free. Yes for free. The file however, is fairly large, but even so, it is probably worse to buy a game you can get for free than it is to leave a slow internet connection on all night so you can get this game. Basically, this game is great, and though it is worth the price, it is still available for free, so that price isn't worth it."
5,GET THIS GAME NO MATTER WHAT!!,"This review is for the ppl that havent gotten cs yet. this game might seem like a violent piece of trash but it really isnt.this game is about using stratedgy and teamwork to accomplish ur objectives. there is a HUGE selection of weapons and gear you can buy at each round. u will never get bored playing this game!! the one drawback to this game is the graphics r ok but not excellent like some pc shooter nowadays. but how can u blame it this game is 5 yrs old!!also even if u get this game u will need ""steam"" to play it online. but steam will make ur online experience MUCH better. and a little later in the yr (hope fully) condition zero will be released!!! better graphics more guns new maps AND EVEN SINGLE PLAYER!!so get this game I GUARANTEE that u will play this game everyday for about two yrs STRAIGHT ITS THAT ADDICTING p.s. HAVE AT LEASTA DSL CONNECTION BEFORE U PLAY ONLINE otherewise u will jus get lagged out and cause commotion."
5,Worth Hundreds of Hours of Online Gaming,"Very near the greatest Online First Person Shooter (FPS) on the net now. It's becoming a bit old by most gaming standards. Sort of like Frogger when Mario Bros. hit the shelves, but this game still has it's charms. The first big plus is the buy system. Unlike some FPS games, this one promotes teamwork by rewarding money after each round. This enables the players to buy equipment. It also promotes individual acheivement in much the same way that other FPS games do: Frag count. Along with the Frag, the player will also recieve a small amount of cash. Not much in the big picture of the game, but enough to make a difference. The graphics are outdated, but this puts less pressure on older systems. Thus making the best Counter-Terrorists the ones with good pings."
5,An amazing game but DONT buy it used,"Like any other valve game if the game is used it wont work because the installation key has all ready been registered to another steam account and each game can only be registered once so if you buy this game used you are GETTING RIPPED OFF I made the mistake of buying two valve games and while I'm only out $16 it's still annoying. Valve will you give you a replacement key but only if you bought the game from retail and still have the original reciept, you're better off playing it safe-ish and downloading the game from steam"
4,A REALLY FUN ADDICTING MULTI-PLAYER GAME!,"Features: This game features pretty nice graphics, realistic damage, and easy controls. There are hundreds of maps to choose from to play in, as well as dozens of great weapons. It is an extremely addicting mutli-player game that sharpens your reflexes, aim, awareness, and much more.Comments: This game is REALLY fun and addicting. It's a great way to spend time with your friends, believe it or not...killing each other. If you have 56k, then I suggest that you DO NOT buy this game. Only people with DSL, LAN, or higher should play because then you will lag and your gameplay will be spoiled. I admit, this game can get tiring, frustrating, and you may begin to get bored with it, but the majority of people are in love with it and continue to play for years to come. For best performance and gameplay, you need AT LEAST DSL and a very decent, fast computer. It's a great game! =]"
4,Great Game but DO NOT BUY!,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOD BUT HERE'S A TIP, SAVE YER MONEY AND BUY HALF-LIFE: GAME OF THE YEAR EDITION. WHY? BECAUSE A) YOU GET TWO WONDERFUL GAMES AND B) YOU CAN DOWNLOAD COUNTER-STRIKE FOR FREE (IF YOU ALREADY HAVE HALF-LIFE, THAT IS)."
4,"Very good, but not worth the money","First of all, dont get me wrong this is one of the best mod/games ever. But the mods included on the game can all be downloaded free from the internet. So what do you want to sacrifice? 30 smackers or some time downloading online?"
5,The Best Darn Game On Earth!!!,"This game is the best game i have ever played!!! I love multiplayer action games more then anything, but this one tops it off. i have had the game since the day it was realsed. There is not a day that goes by that i dont play it. i'm telling you no other multiplayer game compares to it!! so if your in the game store wandering wich one to pick up, dont be stupid!!! go for counter strike!!!"
2,Very Overrated...,I give credit to the graphics but this game is no different then most Multiplayers...I played this at a computer/arcade place er what ever there called nd I didn't like the game that much...The gameplay is alright but Nothing special....BUT IT IS FUN WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING WITH FRIENDS I CAN TELLYOU THAT But over all it's very overrated...
2,"Was entertaining, but lost value.","I started playing Counterstrike nearly when it first came out, beta 4. The game used to be fun, but eventually, do to cheaters, the game deteriorated. Many people play this game in ways that many would consider cheating, or unfair play. Due to the frustration caused by this, the game has lost its value. Also, many people don't play as a team, but instead go solo or ""rambo style"" as I like to call it. Considering this is a teamplay game, when people don't play as a team, it really is no longer fun. Another thing about this game is that it has optional voice chat. I don't know about you, but I don't want to hear some little kid barking orders to me, let alone do I want to hear some people talking about anything while I'm playing this game. In conclusion, this game is not worth it anymore. It'll be fun for a few weeks, but once you get used to it, the game is no longer fun."
1,GREAT GAME I HATE IT,"THEIS GAMEES IS ONE THE WORST ME EVER PLAYED.IT ES MUCHO BLOODY, POOPLES ON THEIS GAME RE NOT SARMT AT ALL! TYEH TAKEL INTO THEIRS MICROPHEUONES AND SAY STUPIDO STUFFS. I ALWAYSES GET ME SHTO BEFROE I GETS TO MY BYU A GON. ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US! WHNE I GO OTU PEOPLE CALL ME A NUB, WHTEVERY THAT MEANSF. OD NOT BYU THEIES GAME, IT SUCSK BAD NARODS."
1,HaHaHaHa I'm surprised they call this a game,"Well lets just get a few things clear on why this game [stinks]. First of all when you get it you will find out you have to download about 6 hours of updates! Well after I did that I went to play a multiplayer game and quickly found out the graphics well arn't ""up to code"" we'll say. This game would be great if you barley want any realism at all, as in you can spray out bullets on full auto and have no accuracy problems. To top it all off once you wait 30 minutes to get in a game, you can hardly hold a connection for 5 minutes before you have got a message Surver has been lost or something like that. If you want a good shooting game and a GREAT multiplayer gam buy Rouge Spear, which is much more realistic!"
2,Not worth your money,"Yo yo yo,how is it goin down in your house? Dont buy the game. It is simply a waste of your money. CS 1.6 is good and free. Sure CZ has some pretty good bots and some updated maps with new textures. Wow big woop. It has more bugs than 1.6. Single player is simple to beat. DONT GET THIS STUPID GAME!"
2,Brief and to the point,"This game used to be a 5 in my book, but recently, heavy amounts of cheating and otherwise ""unfair"" gameplay have made me stop playing this game. I had played this game since nearly its begining and the cheating and unfairness of the game have driven me away from it. Don't get this game unless you are ready for the frustration of cheaters and cheap players."
5,GREATEST GAME,"This is, absolutely, positively, the greatest online game of our time.Yeah, you heard me right.I got this game as a Christmas present 2 years ago. Ever since then, I have played this game EVERY chance I get. Graphics are awesome, weapons are wicked, gameplay is insanely addicting.If you have a fast enough computer, a little time on your hands and a decent modem, buy this game and get ready to experience one of the greatest games you will ever play.For even more fun, call up your friend and tell him to buy the game. Then, find out what online server he is at, then hop in and compete against each other and 1000's of other people across the nation, and the world.BUY THIS GAME! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!Unfortunately, Counter-Strike is only a multi-player online game, although the mod's of other Half-Life games that came with CS are pretty cool too. Some ARE one-player. Another down-side: It will not work well if you do not have a nice computer with a decent memory card and modem."
4,"GREAT,but can be a bit buggy","i shall start this review rather unpleasently,with a good shout to all those who gave this game a low rating cuz thry think u can download it....THAT IS JUST THE COUNTERSTRIKE MOD THIS INCLUDES HALF LIFE AND OPPOSING FORCE MULTIPLAYER,TEAM FORTRESS,CS,AND 4 OTHER MODS...don't forget the 4 other mods.anyway,this is THE fps to buy,even if the graphics are a bit dated.if you get the bonus disk(which i think amazon's version includes)you get lots of stuff,most importantly the .BOTs .5 stars for gameplay,minus one for the dated graphics and the fact it can be a bit slow and buggy"
5,GOOD SHTUFF,item came in 11 days. not too shabby. item was good and new. WORTH THE WAIT. GOOD SHTUFF
2,Extreamly Overrated and Overhyped,"I'll make this short and sweet for you. I went to a cyber cafe so I can play this ""gem"" and see what all the fuss is about on this game. OVERRATED. I have no idea how people prais this as ""THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!!""...How silly, This game is just plain average.. If you wanna play a nice Game from Valve..I don't need to tell you but I'll give you a hint....H***f L*fe...This game is just pure garbage and the Online is boring...And I don't need your flaming or bashing just cause One mans opinion differs from yours..The goodVisuals are good I guessBadVery MediocerPlain boring combat...Nothing newOnline isn't that greatExtreamly Overrated...TRUST ME..Gets boring after awhileAnd yes I played this out for more then an 1hour...2 bucks I'll never get back2.1 out of 5 stars.... Extreamly Overrated, Not worth my 2 bucks, and that's all I got to say....Peace"
3,Much used but mediocre and confusing layout...,"The text is crammed into the small format book, making each page look very cluttered, and it is difficult to find where one lesson ends and another begins. The words being used are ok, but the exercises to help learn them are short and the stories for context are extrememly short and uninspiring. Learning vocab. should have SOME element of interest/fun to it...The answers to the older series have been posted on various websites at one time or another by students hoping to skip the work so there is a newer edition (pub. 2002)."
1,Vocabulary Dorkshop,"This book was pitiful. It didn't teach my kid a thing! It was sad. I feel that whoever created this monstrosity of a so-called ""Vocabulary Book"" needs to reconsider his writing skills and consult me. I'm going to write my own book ""Vocab Wonders!"" coming soon in late 2003. This is horrible. Bye Bye"
4,Not as hot as some of her others but a strong read,"Hot Streak was not my favorite of Susan Johnson's novels but it delivers the complex characters, strong story line and spicy love scenes her fans expect. A good read from a great author."
2,This COULDN'T be the Susan Johnson I know-,"What a poor excuse for a romance! I bought this because I saw a Susan Johnson that I hadn't read and the date indicated that it wasn't that old. I usually learn a lot from the historical period that she writes in and really enjoy the sensuality that she writes with. I wish this had said ""Re-issued from an earlier publication"" or something to let me know I wasn't getting the author that I so enjoy.It was trite, unimaginative, and really just boring."
5,Guide to Gospel Centered Living,"This devotional is amazing! Charles Ringma does an outstanding job centering each day on prayer and reflection in the realms of our modern world all the while keeping in mind the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Each entry I've read in this devotional is challenging, inspiring, and true. I have given it to a number of pastors and colleagues and they have all responded back with excitement and conviction. If you truly want to grow spiritually and build your faith on Christ's justice, compassion, and truth I highly recommend this devotional to you."
5,Ellul exposes the artifical systems that infect the Church,"This little dynamic devotional is deep food for thought for those who love to see outside the box of mainstream Christianity. It will ""rattle your cage"" if you are a ""status quo"" Christian who doesn't want to see the negative challenges that mar the impact of The Church on the unchurched. Ellul calls us to be authentic and consistent in all arenas of life, and to reflect Christ in earthy ways that shed off the religious stiffness of some mainstream Christians."
3,Help is on the way..,"Some may remember the slogan ""help is on the way"" from the 2004 election cycle. The slogan for 2008 is recasted as ""Hope"" and ""Change"". This book is a good reminder that ""Hope"" cannot be found in the government or any man, but in G-d."
3,Smaller head has trouble with tonality,"due to its size, the 8"" hydraulic seems to have no tone at all and sounds like playing on a muffled plastic take-out soup container"
3,Michelle Yeoh,"Michelle Yeoh is, as nearly always, in excellent form. Her companions (and the story itself) are only so-so. Nothing to write home about."
4,Daughter recounts the struggle of her Father,"Salma Mardam Bey recounts the life and struggle of her father, former Syrian Prime Minister Jamil Mardam Bey, in an interesting, informative, and selective manner. The author choses one period of her father's career, the brightest, and sheds light on his activities in the Syrian nationalist movement. The works derives its importance from being the first book written by a Syrian author in the English language, addressing this era. Being a collection of memoirs of the most cunning politician of his generation, the work is valuable for researchers and Middle East specialists. Yet, the family touch and the author's tone decreases some of the work's credibility. Apart from this work, no other biographical work exists in the English language on Syria's one-time democratic politicians."
5,A tribute to a bygone era,"A short but well-written account of a bygone era, when people by the thousands would each summer flock to The Beach district of Toronto. The book deals with the specific parks that came and went, as well as a few landmarks of the area. Included are numerous photos. Although the book is fairly thin, the author's intent to convey the spirit of this unique time and place is very much a success. A great book."
5,Chicken Soup with Dear Abby,"This book is amazing! Hurley's dazzling, normal, starving artist lifestyle is an inspiration. His book's style is kind of chicken soup for the soul meets Dear Abby. Snaps to Dan Hurley, the sixty second novelist."
4,Good intention,"Good intention, but a bunch of maps without any explanation does not mean much. Moreover, in my case, I need to use a magnifying lens to see the small words because of the maps reduction."
3,Somewhat useful...,"Although it's not at all clear from the title or description, most of this book is about the cleaning and customization of chromatic harminicas- the fancy ones with the slide- and not the simple diatonic harps that most people play. Some of the information is useful to diatonioc players, but most is not.The chromatic info is useful, but of somewhat uneven quality and style. Tuning- one of the most useful mods a player can do- is covered in a very superficial manner. Some of the mods, like reshaping the internal channels in the comb, are discussed at length without a lot of explanation was to why one mught want to bother. And many mods are presented with only the barest oif details- certainly not enough to insure that the tyro doesn't desctroy an expensive harmonica while learning how.As one reviewer has noted, far more information is out there on the web awaiting only a quick Google search. I'd do that before I considered buying this book."
3,"Good reference, but...","I got this book because a couple of my harmonicas weren't working all that well, and I thought the book would help me get them back into shape. Much of the information here is available on the Net for free, and repairing and tuning a harmonica is like trying to write the Bible on a grain of rice. It can be done, but it's extremly difficult and time consuming.If you have a lot more time than money, this book ""might"" help you out. However, while you may be able to fix your car, build a deck, and even perform brain surgery, you'll soon find that repairing and tuning a harmonica is not as easy as this book makes it appear, regardless of how much patience you have.I give it three stars because it's informative, but those harmonicas I wanted to fix still aren't, and I'm usually very good at stuff like this."
3,O.K. but disappointing (a history teacher's review),"So, why am I disappointed?I was hoping for an theme-based work that looked at different mysterious objects, behaviors and cultures of the ancient world across the world and made comparisons and connections between them.Instead, this book is a series of unrelated articles that have the look and feel of the National Geographic style. Don't get me wrong - I like the National Geographic style but the book as a whole lacks flow and feels more like a copy of the magazine than a special book. It is not an integrated work and leaves out plenty of big mysteries (Great Zimbabwe, Nazca Lines, Petra, the Olmecs) in favor of smaller mysteries such as the Etruscans and Catal Huyuk.Topics include:EtruscansIce age cave paintingsStonehenge and related MegalithsMinoan civilizationMycenaean civilizationCatal Huyuk & JerichoEaster Island, South Pacific OceanAncient EgyptAncient India"
3,Informative but limited,"When I got this book I was expecting it to contain so much more than it did. Basically what the reader gets is the same information about the pyramids, Stonehenge, and Easter Island that can be found in just about any other book. There is no new information in it, but it does have some great pictures and photos."
1,Was this a second? Braun 8000CP Foil/Cutter,"This is without a doubt the worst purchase I have made through Amazon.com. In my experience, these foil screens usually last at least 8-9 months. This screen lasted 2-3 weeks before wearing out (two holes in the screen). Can I get my money back?"
2,difficulty contacting the company,"We purchased 4 planters as Christmas gifts and they arrived very quickly. The white planter is lightweight plastic and is easily snapped together. Easy to store away in off season. When 2 of them were snapped together we noticed a crack in one. When we tried to contact the seller, they did not respond back to us so we have been unable to resolve the issue. Because we have heard nothing from Fun Shipped Fast we decided to contact our credit card company. We are still waiting to hear from someone..........."
2,Disappointed,"planters are not white --more of a gray color and look dingy-colored next to white vinyl; ordered two and one of them had a piece cracked -- not worth sending back, but a good reminder that you get what you pay for; overall disappointed in color and quality"
5,Outstandingly durable,"I bought 2 of these planters a year and a half ago to flank our front door. They were simple to put together, and had the look of the painted white wood planters I've always admired, but the maintenance-free vinyl/plastic that we need/want.To date, these planters have endured a derecho, remnants of a couple of hurricanes, and quite a few severe thunderstorms, not to mention that they are located on a full sun, high heat stoop, all year round (oh, and the neighbor's dog lifting its leg impolitely, ;/).After rinsing down with a hose every month or two, they continue to look brand new, and have no damage.Thumbs up!Oh! - One last thing...these are not actual planting planters (does that make sense?). They do not have solid bottoms. We buy plants and either place the nursery pots in the planters, or we replant into 8-10"" pots that we place into the planters. Same thing."
5,Chippendale Planter,"Very pleased with these planters. They must be assembled and it was a two-person task but not too difficult. They look great and I am very pleased with all aspects----quality, price, etc."
4,Not to bad,This Sparco Shift knob is pretty cool. at tad bit over priced for what i received. Overall it sits lower than a stock one would so it gives it a diff feel but i wish it had some weight (not too much) added to it. it seems tough but its really light. The installation was a breeze and ive been using it for two days now and its growing on me.
4,Sparco globe Shift knob,"I recieved this brand new in the packaging, shipping was great. the knob feels a lot better than oem. looks so good!! It needs no threads so you can cut the threads off your shifter to make it shorter. I put this on my ralco rz short shifter. Works great!! 4 stars because it needs just a bit more weight. Good seller."
4,"very interesting and well written, but lacking humor","This book was very interesting and well-written, but it lacked any humor whatsoever, which is usually Wrede's forte. However, the plot was very creative, suspenseful, etc. I liked this book and recomend it to all fantasy lovers, that is if you can read anything without a lot of good jokes."
3,Lacking Magic,"While ""Harp"" wasn't hard to read, it wasn't a breathtaking book, either. I've read Wrede's Enchanted Forest series, so I was looking for that same humor and lighthearted fun. Maybe it's impossible to achieve that in an adult's fantasy novel? Nontheless, the commonplaceness of the book was a dissapointment to me."
1,"When I first heard about it, I thought it was some revelation","The only people to give a good review of this book are people who 1) either hate Jews or 2) bleeding heart liberals hopelessly in love with Palestinians. The fact of the matter is, nothing in this book is a secret, it is an imperative for Jews to save lives, not matter what, so if they collaborated with Eichmann to save their people that is fine, unfortunately the Nazi's changed their plans and chose to eliminate the Jews instead of deporting them to Israel. One cant help but think what small thing could have been done to stop all of this in the beginning."
1,So what!?,"I see nothing in these allegedly shocking documents that shocks me. Why wouldn't anyone who wanted to save the lives of Jews not cooperate with the devil himself - or even Hitler (who was worse because he actually existed!) - to save them? And why wouldn't Hitler want all the Jews he could get out of the country to go and resettle in a small strip of land in the Mideast, all the better to eventually wipe them out? Indeed, Hitler was *definitely* collaborating with the Palestnian Arabs with whom he shared the goal of doing just that. Lip-service to tryants who can wipe you out is a not a surprising thing, especially when there is a war going on with the outcome uncertain. One says and does what is necessary to survive, which may be ""unprincipled"" but is also understable."
1,Hilarious!,"This book is funny. Its so hilariously anti-semitic and filled with half-truth, unsupported facts and fully incorrect facts (not just about Zionism, but about WWII as well). I have to say I actually enjoyed reading it for all the wrong reasons. Its kind of like reading an Al Qaeda speech. You'll get a strange sense of enjoyment from realising how screwed up people can be. All I can say is ""Wow"". What's disturbing about this book isn't so much the book itself (Let's face it: there world has, and always will have a percentage of jew-hating nutballs, but the reviewers on this site who seem to *not* understand that fact: Now that's some scary sh*t yo)."
1,One and One is Three,"Fact 1: Hitler wanted Jews either dead or out of Europe.Fact 2: Jews wanted to build a homeland in Israel, largely because Europe was so anti-Semitic.Brenner Logic: Hitler must have been a Zionist, and Jews must have been Nazis.Talk about turning logic on its head.This is like saying that when the Arabs wanted Jews to leave Iraq, Morrocco and other Arab countries, it meant Arabs were Zionists."
1,Antisemitic trash,"Her Lenni Brenner takes a very complex and dark time in history and twists it to make claims and draw conclusions that are, at best, delusional and paranoid and at worst, a pure expression of hatred and furthering of egotistical agenda. Unfortunately, there are many readers who share his hatred, and are quite happy to jump on Brenner's revisioninst bandwagon (e.g. william hughes is a classic example). Its a disgusting display and heartbreaking to find that the depth of ignorance and evil of that time & place is alive & well in this time & place."
5,French Doll painting,This book has everything you need to paint french dolls of all kind. It's very detailed and it shows you all the french dolls that you can rep-roduce and each maker in detailad description and photos. I give it 5 stars and am very hap-py with this book.
1,I was disappointed,"I have purchased many other Humongous software products including Freddi Fish, Pajama Sam and other Putt Putt titles. This is by far the most basic and most disappointing game my five year old has played. He got it on Christmas day and finished it with minimal assistance by me in about an hour. He looked at me and said, ""I guess that's it for this game."" It was not worth the money at all!"
4,Great game...,"My daughter loved this game. She just beat it and was so excited to show me. I had to help her in one part, but I have a feeling next time she won't need my help. Putt Putt is her favorite Humongous character. We have all the games. Too bad they don't make these games anymore. We finished the Freddi Fish games and now the Putt Putt games. I guess we will have to move on to Pajama Sam or Spy Fox.Putt Putt is fun to watch, decent voice over and puzzles are just the right difficulty for 3-6 years old. Even if they are too easy, they are still fun. I think my daughter will be asking to play this again in a few months. I hate to say it, but I enjoy helping her beat these games.Oh yeah, these games are old, so make sure you buy the Windows XP version if it is available. But if not, Vista will let you install using an older version of Windows. Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features > Use an older program with this version of Windows. Good luck!"
2,DVD's,This one did not play for us scratched up and cracked. It was cheap enough not to complain about it.
4,Circus Fun! :),"This game was challenging but in a good way. There were several hidden items and you had to really think sometimes. Honestly, the hardest part was remembering where all the people were and which paths to take. :P It was entertaining to see all the circus acts and to be part of the circus. Overall, this game was fun and one of the better Putt-Putt games."
1,Mac NOT,This product is noted that it will work in a Mac. It might work in the older versions but it will not work in the new Intel based machines. That should be noted in the description of the product.
5,For my 16 grandchildren,Brilliant game- kept the grandchildren occupied for hours - and they're still playing the game (and so are their parents)
2,Looks great but not functional,"I purchased this case after getting tired of waiting for Creatives leather case to become available. As far as appearance, it is well crafted. When it comes to functinality, it stinks. Here are the problems I have with it: 1) there is no hole for the microphone, 2) the hole for the headphone jack is not lined up properly, 3) the charger and sync adapter brick can't fully engage the player because of the leather straps, so it is easily disengaged by the slightest movement. This is ok at home, but try using this in the car (if you want to charge while you listen); it falls out with every turn you make. This case was not designed with much thought about the functions of the zen player."
4,Good case...,"This is a good case made with nice materials. it offers a nice fit and buttons are easily usable. it comes with a clear screen protector and has a belt clip so you can carry it more comfortably. it is just a little bulky, but nothing to worry about if you plan to carry it in your belt, hand bag or hands. it could only fit big pockets, though. my only serious gripe is about the inner seams, they are very rough and could scratch the surface of your player. yes, Zen Vision:M's have very soft coating and this could leave marks. anyways, you really should consider getting a skin for your zen (Best Skins Ever) in any case. This is a very good case overall."
1,Leather Case Very Disappointing,"WARNING!!! Can not use button features to operate Zen player because leather case is way too tight! You can hardly get the player into the case so no amount of time or breaking in period is going to fix the problem. Sadly, it's like having a pair of shoes that are so tight you have to remove them so you can walk. [...]"
2,"Okay for keeping it IN, but not for using","You can use this case for storage which is what I do now. It doesn't allow me to click the buttons, the bottom two since it squeezes it already and it's down so I can't access them. Overall, it's ok for just keeping your player in there. I really recommend an invisible shield, it works better than this case for sure. This case is a bit bulky, but it's alright if you don't mind taking the player out to press the buttons to change songs and put it back in. Sometimes when you put it back in, it will accidentally press one of the buttons which can be annoying and pretty much is. Basically, if you want a case to keep it in this isn't too bad, but another product is better for sure. Either my case was jinxed or they are all like that."
1,Aiwa mini systems have CD problems,"My son has an Aiwa mini system that the 3-CD changer has quit working after about 15 months of use. In researching on the web, I found this to not be unusual for many Aiwa mini systems.We will not buy Aiwa again."
1,"Poor Quality, Poor Fundamentals","I bought an Aiwa product and experienced very poor quality. The stereo cuts out at higher volumes. Also the CD player is already broken after 2 years. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I was attracted to the good sound and even better price, it looks like I got what I paid for. Bad product components from inadequate power supply to poor quality of moving parts even worse customer support. There is no reason a piece of electronics should fail after two years."
1,Don't waste your money on minisystems from Aiwa (aka: Junk)!,"Well, after reading several other reviews, it seems that I can add my name to the long list of angry customers who wasted their money on Aiwa products. I, too, have a ""wonderful"" stereo that now refuses to play any CD's after only a year and a half! This has happened to my parents after two years. This has also happened to my friend who has had her stereo for about a year and a half. Beware all of you who rave about your wonderful Aiwa stereos. The CD players will most likely break in a few years. Have fun! The moral of the story is: DON'T BUY AIWA STEREOS!"
1,AIWA JUNK,"I'VE HAD MY AIWA FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS IT'S THE NSX V9000. PIECE OF JUNK. CD PLAYER QUIT AFTER 14 MONTHS. SPEAKER BLEW,SPEAKER BOX RATTLES. AT FIRST I WAS VERY HAPPY AND THEN JUST AFTER FACTORY WARRANTY RAN OUT. OOOOO BOY WATCH OUT REPAIR MAN'S DREAM! $$$$"
1,Reliability questionable,"I have noticed that most of the reviews regarding this product are recent. I bought an AIWA system for my college age son. We both felt it was a great value for the money until one month past the warranty expiration when the CD changer quit working. A couple of months later, the tape deck went out. Everyone my son knows with an AIWA product has run into the same problem. My college age daughter reports the same. I tried contacting AIWA, but their web site does not even provide a way to send an e-mail. After an extended wait on their 800 number, I was told there was nothing they could do once a product was 3 months past warranty other than charge what I considered an exorbitant fee for repair. Bottomline: if well-cared for AIWA systems barely last more than a year, how great is the value?"
3,Decent system,"This Aiwa system (like many of the company's products), has some serious problems with it. My friend picked it up about a year ago, and since then its only been downhill.The CD changer conked out, the tape deck became a hazard to his tapes.But its low price ensures that it will still be an attractive option. It does well with most types of music. However there is a bit too much Harmonic Distortion at higher volumes, which is quite noticeable(unless you only listen to heavy metal :)) It might look like a giveaway price at first, but look into it carefully...you may be getting more hassles that you bargained for.My advice is to go for the Panasonic SC-AK58, which has similar specifications to this stereo, but with better overall quality."
4,Powerful System... but it has some problems.,"When I first took out this sound system, I was decently impressed. I have had it for 2 months now and everything has worked perfectly, but as others have commented, I am thinking the cd drive may break because it has made an odd squeaking noise when it rotates.... Otherwise, it's a great system with some good power but not the greatest clarity. The surround speakers are rather low quality though. The rest is great, so go buy it, because 299 watts for this amount of money is too good to pass up!"
5,What a bargain!,"What attracted me was the front panel AUX jack - it seemed to be the perfect unit for my iPod - and I'm glad it did. For me, this is a great receiver. It has all the power and features I could ask for, all for a remarkably low price. Best of all, it's a Sony."
5,Great little girls book,"This book has rhyming and is just as sweet as can be. Its all from a perspective of the daughter and daddy together, daughter asking daddy questions and daddy answering them. They are fun, informative, and funny questions all set to a rhythm and with beautifully pictures. My daughter loved this so much as a library book we checked out that I had to buy it for her, along with the other two books created the same by the same author. I would say of the dozens and dozens of books she has, this is of the top 3 favorites."
3,Cute but not empowering.,"Cute book about child enjoying nature. I do like the part where you can insert your child's photo. However, I thought it would be show more strong, empowering qualities. Just ordered Paper Bag Princess which I hope fills the bill."
5,"Great mystery book, I couldn't put it down! Fascinating!","I look forward to ANY book by Elaine Viets, they always provide me with hours of wonderful reading!"
2,THIS CD HAD ARRNGEMENTS BY NELSON RIDDLE BUT .........,"I have never heard a cd that had Nelson Riddle arrangements that i didn't like. This is no exception. The main concern i have for this cd is that Rosie sang too many songs that were not that good of song. Her voice was great. Her song selection was poor. Of the 12 tracks listed i could only gravitate to 5. Rosie, better luck with your repertoire in the future."
4,Excellent book!,"Although I was a young child when the black mafia was in full force in Philly, I remember a lot of the names from my family and neighbors. Now I have recollection of what seemed to be a scattered figment of my past. I am a native ""Phillian"" from West Philly and was exposed to some of the illegal stuff. Good Job!"
4,excluded issues and charactors,"I am a former Philadelphia Highway Patrolman who also happened to grow up in West Philadelphia and I am a close relative of some of the politicians cited in the book. As a result, I knew a lot of the subjects and subject matter in the book.While it was, for the most part, factual. The writer,in my opinion, took some liberties with certain facts and details.One example of this was his failure to elaborate on the sleazy character of Stanley Branch and the relationship he enjoyed with his brother Gilbert, who happened to be the chief of detectives in the District Attorney's office.There was at least an appearence of conflict and impropriety with respect to these two."
3,Good People do Bad Things (or maybe not),"The book was okay, it would be even been better, if I didn't know some of the individuals. These guys are good people, and I don't think it's fear to judge any of them, it is innocent until proven guilty right? Why should we take the authors word for anything? After all, this book was written by an ex-cop, who used snitches (liars) statements to write this book. I believe most of the book was fabricated, and then he made a reference to the Savage-Thomas organization, Huh? A non-existing organization. Maybe it does exist, just without Savage or Thomas. Gerald Thomas is deceased, and Kaboni Savage is innocent."
3,Not to be done individually,"I can see this book being very usefull as part of a university degree, in the classroom, with a teacher and classmates to help out. The theory covered on the first chapter is small but good quality overall. The exercises are interesting and well explained.I found really hard to take advantage of this material on my own. I couldn't measure my progress and correct my mistakes properly. In the end, I found thatHearing and Writing Music: Professional Training for Today's Musician (2nd Edition)was much easier to study on my own."
5,Laid back and smooth,This album has some nice beats and thought provoking lyrics. This cat pulls a no holds barred approach to telling it how it is on the streets. Infinite is on the right track to establish his music as an infinite source of widsom.
3,WICKED,The album is wicked although you need some more tracks Dale! But 360 and Take a Look is the wickest songs on the album. I'm really proud of you all. Where's Beatbox Roger! And bruck foot big nose Jason!
1,Meaningless book,"Almost 200 pages of random photos, statistics, and sentences quoted from other sources. For example: ""In 2000 there were 492 primary schools and 152 secondary schools in Tijuana."" ""Nortec is the soundtrack of life on the Tijuana-San Diego border."" ""In 2004, seven different police agencies existed in Tijuana."" ""My beloved Tijuana: are you baptized?""One could create the same cacophany about any town, city, or region in the world, so the random quotes reveal nothing distinctive about Tijuana. Tijuana is fascinating; this book is not."
1,Stupid,"This is in German!!! I couldn't return it though because I opened it, even though it was poorly presented online."
1,Magnets are not strong enough.,I went through 2 of these after Amazon was nice enough to replace the first one that was destroyed on the freeway. Need to clamp them down in addition to the magnet strength. Really convenient but money would be better spent on something more durable.
3,Towing lights,"Very nice setup,plenty of wire for my setup. Magnets are not very strong. willprobable have to zip tie them to keep them from falling off.OK for the price, you get what you pay for..."
1,Mystery Product Award,"I give one star not because the product doesn't work (I have no idea if it does or doesn't) but because it is useless until somebody gives an explanation of how to use it, or shows a picture of how it is used. I searched the internet, using several search providers, and could not find a single picture of the intended use.Does it wrap around your neck? Do you ride it like a broomstick? I can't fathom how to use it to stretch my legs. If I knew how it is used to stretch my legs, I might buy it."
1,"Worst ""documentary"" I have ever seen","This is so poorly done that if I hadn't read the BMF book by Mara Shalhoup I would not even be able to follow the story. Actually, there is no story on this DVD - its just disjointed, doubletalk that mentions money, drug trafficking and living the high life - there is no timeline, there is no history of how the BMF was formed or even what they were about. Martin Luther King has more air time on this video than Terry Flenory - so what does that tell you? Read Shalhoup's book if you want to know the story. Don't waste your time or money on this."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL,"I was expecting this cut of the movie to be an improvement, but it was not. The extra scenes diluted the story: They took attention away from the story. This is a story about a 'peppy' band, and the original story was 'peppy' too. This version makes the movie lose it's rhythm. The story gets lost in the extra footage. These scenes make the movie too long, and a little tedious. I was considering giving it one star. I would send this one back if I could. I am looking for the original version."
3,It's cute but forgettable.,"That Thing You Do! was written and directed by Tom Hanks and he also co-stars in this swinging comedy. I like this film but I always forget the ending of it. Liv Tyler and Steve Zahn make this movie fun and joyous. I like that silly song the band sings but I wouldn't say this film broke any new ground, Hanks is a talented guy but I would never buy this film, too corny for my taste."
4,Great disc for an underrated movie,"If you love this movie, and I do because it's rewatchable, then this disc is for you because since it's the director's cut it gives you much more story. Too much actually. I can see why it was cut down for the theater to bring it in under two hours, but the added story and story lines explain a lot more about the characters and their motivations. It's still a fun movie to watch but I doubt I'd watch this full version more than once or twice."
4,Feel Good,"Under-rated, this is a charming movie with a charming cast and a charming little story with some bite. It's surprising that Tom Hanks hasn't directed more. Tracing the rise and brief success of a 60's pop group, it has a clean, frothy quality that one rarely sees."
5,awesome movie,I love this movie! It's filled with stars and the director's cut makes a great movie even better. I am really glad I bought it because cable only shows the original version. It was like getting to see it for the first time again.
3,Forget the extended Cut,"If you want to show a young family, the original cut is the movie to see.Very disappointed with a few of the new cuts. It was disjointed.Thanks to the editor. He got it right."
4,Fun movie,"I'm surprised that this movie was as small of a hit as it was. It didn't have big names among the lead actors, but I would have figured that Hanks' name alone could've sold people on seeing this one.It's a nice movie. Not Oscar-worthy, not gripping, but it keeps you entertained the entire time. You quickly become attached to the characters, you care about their success, and the story gets you there quickly. I definitely recommend this one to anyone."
4,A great feel-good film,"While some people may not get into how predictable or unbelievable this film is it nevertheless tells a very true story which was all too common in the early 1960's and which still holds true today. The film follows the story of the One-ders (Wonders after a smart re-christening) who started as a small Erie, PA garage band and experienced a meteoric rise to fame in the innocence of early 60's pop music. The film, while corny in some parts, tells a very poignant story with a refreshing mixture of humour and drama. The band's reaction to the swirling events around them make for a great storyline and an effective lessons-learned presentation of the real world of pop music; everything from marketing and promotion to relationships among band members.Fame can be a wonderful yet damaging experience and this film effectively demonstrated that. Not to mention very funny and lively. A great film."
5,Fun adventure for all!,"It made me feel like I was one of the Beatles going from a common everyday life to superstar musician status in a short period of time(it's not about the Beatles,but it was about a group of American musicians in that era.) The song s were really good,and the acting was was great,overall fabulous movie to watch. much fun for the whole family."
5,This is a great family film!,That Thing You Do! is surpisingly good. My whole family loves this film and the music. It's a film that leaves you with a smile on your face and a song on your lips.
4,Stick with the theatrical version,"The 'extended version' is a much poorer film than the theatrical cut. Every added scene instantly saps the energy and momentum which made the original film so entertaining. You find yourself constantly thinking, 'why did they put this in the movie? Oh, right...they didn't.' It's clear why the deleted scenes were--deleted. You see more of Charlize Theron cheating, Tom Hanks acting ambiguously gay, and more of Jimmy being a jerk. The new material turns the original characters into unrelatable caricatures which then come across as over-the-top and ridiculous.That said, this movie remains a solid family favorite. I won't watch the extended version again, but it is entertaining to watch the other, behind-the-scenes extras. It was especially interesting to watch the cast members learn their instruments and tour Japan.I highly recommend this video, the only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars was the disappointing 30 minutes of deleted scenes."
5,Doing that thing you do,The directors cut answered so many questions that came up in the edited version. The relationships between the friends and then the addition of their manager in all of that created a great movie. Too bad everyone couldn't just skip the edited versin and gostraight to the Directors Cut.
5,Keen slice of 60's culture,"Written and directed by Tom Hanks, TTYD tells the story of the early garage bands and their rise to the top of the charts. He helped assemble a remarkable cast that work their way into your heart while reminding us of a time where overnight sensations took weeks if not months to surface.This is one of my all time favorite movies for several reasons: quirky dialogue, kinda hokey characters (because of the time setting), cross country travel, and very archetypal players. Fans of Tom Hanks will recognize many of his colleagues that appear in much of the work that he does. I recommend this movie for days when you're feeling down and you want a pick me up."
3,The Oneders!!!!,"Tom Hanks wrote and directed this lighthearted film about a bunch of friends who have a small band who record a song that becomes a huge smash. The downside is that they become another victim of the title 'one hit wonder'. The film takes place in the 1960's and that's a great way to have this movie. Tom Hanks himself appears in a supporting role as the band's manager. The cast is great. Their characters come off as real people. Tom Everett Scott, who plays Guy, comes off in a very charming, appealing Tom Hanks-y way. He's a star to look forward too in the future. The music itself is superb. Do yourself a favor and also get the soundtrack to this wonderful film. It's funny, entertaining, rocking, and very nostalgic. This was a great achievement for the always fantastic Tom Hanks. After seeing this film, you'll be looking forward to the next film that Tom writes and directs. Hope it's soon."
1,That Thing You Do,I purchased this movie and when it arrived it could not be played. I went to mail it back and the cost of mailing was about the same as the purchase price of the movie. I through it away instead!
2,FUN,"This is a fun movie. The people in it are fun. The music is fun. Tom Hanks is fun. He seems to relish his role here (since he wrote it)... taking a break from the more serious dramatic roles that have shaped his more recent career. The film concerns a group of teenagers who form a band and become wildly popular and start to tour. It also concerns the trappings of fame, losing your first love and losing the starry-eyed innocence of being young. But never quite giving up hope. Tom Everett Scott is good here as the drummer, Guy, and you will feel genuine happiness for him and the character played by Liv Tyler when they finally get together at the end."
1,very unsatisfied,"I was very excited to see that the movie I have been looking for for so long was so affordable, but I was very discouraged when I got it to find that it was the international edition and did not work on any of my tv's in the U.S. I returned it"
3,I ordered the wrong format.,I do not know how this product works. The only reason I am writing this is to let others know of a mistake I made and maybe help them not to make the same mistake. THIS ITEM DOES NOT WORK IN DVD PLAYERS IN THE USA. IT IS MADE FOR DVD PLAYERS FORMATTED FOR OTHER COUNTRIES. I did not notice this when I ordered it. I did not even know there are different formats. I was just looking at the price. My rating has nothing to do with the operation of this product. Just giving a heads up so you don't make the same mistake.
3,where's the 5.1,"i just viewed That Thing You Do expecting a 5.1 or dts sountrack but to my surprise there was neither. all it had was a dolby 5.0. it sounded allright but the reason i bought this version was for the dts sound track. the info on the back of case i have stated dolby 5.0 not the dolby 5.1 and dts as stated on the That Thing You DO Amazon web page information on contents of the dvd. i feel i've been lied to. i refer to this alot when buying my movies. what i want to know, is there a copy out there with a 5.1 and dts soundtrack or do i have a different copy of the same movie.This refers to the new Tom Hank's extended cut"
4,Great Movie,"That Thing You Do combines an interesting story, good music, and lots of laughs to create a enjoyable movie worth watching again and again. Tom Hanks did a great job directing and acting in this movie."
3,That thing you do,I love this movie!! I have been looking for it on DVD for a long time. The only thing that I was disappointed with was everyone once in a while subtitles will pop up on the bottom of the screen and won't match the movie and will be blurred.
4,Extended cut disappointing,"I've loved 'That Thing You Do' for years on VHS. When I saw the DVD at a local bookstore, I started dropping hints to my wife for my birthday. Lovely to hear the sounds in surround and the music is well mixed. However, the extended cut added a whole lot of unnecessary innuendo and it changed the ending slightly. I'll enjoy watching the original theatrical cut over and over, I'm sure"
4,A Great Movie about at Great Time!,"This is the funnest movie! I think one of the reasons I love it so much is because it takes place in a time period when I was a teenager. I can really relate to it. It's funny, touching, and a good story. Apparently it's also based on a true story."
5,DVD review,Excellent DVD! The extended cut is really interesting with 40 minutes of unseen scenes!The bonus content is also great for The Wonders' fans!Highly recommended!
4,Just Fine 3,"How can you not like a movie with a jazz drummer as the romantic lead? Unless, of course, you're a blue grass fan."
2,DVD did not play!,"I purchased this DVD for my daughter and her family for Christmas. I had an entire ""movie night"" laid out for them, only the DVD would not play in their DVD player. Quite the disappointment!"
5,Great Movie - Vendor Trouble,"We love this movie. In fact we bought this DVD as a replacement because we wore out our first one. But we had trouble with the vendor Movie Mars who sent us the wrong disc, then didn't send a replacement so we still don't have a copy to watch."
5,The One-Ders!,This is a wonderful film! Not only is the music great and original but the film itself has the same look and feel of period films like Help! and Ferry 'Cross the Mersey. This is well worth going out of your way for.
1,"Don't let the title of ""Tom Hank's Extented Cut"" fool you!!","I purchased two discs of That Thing You Do, expected extented director's cut and the original version as promised. Well, after pressing the menu button countless times. There is no Tom Hank's director's cut appearing on this Two- Disc Special Edition, only it has the original version but no director's cut at all. I am very furious at Amazon for lying to me."
2,Could have been good.,"At the beginning of the film I was having a lot of fun, but afterwards the movie goes nowhere. They repeat the song again and again and again and the dialogue gets lamer and emptier every scene. Finally nothing interesting happens in the film. Tom Hanks is a good actor, he should stay acting. I like the song, though..."
2,"Just OK, nothing special","I expected an entertaining movie judging by these reviews,but I was disappointed. This is a trite, ordinary movie with a catchy song."
1,a WHite Version of The Five Heartbeats,"this film is Horrible! Tom Hanks should just stick to doing the Sappy roles he does so well.this film is nothing but a WHite Version of Robert Townsends the Five Heartbeats.the song the things you do is real corny&weak.as chessy as the show Friends theme song.leave the music,Directing and unoriginal concepts to PROS.Tom Hanks let the Vanity way out the bag on this mess."
1,Hideous! 1 star only because there is no lower choice available,"This film is so god-awful it makes me sweat with embarassment for my limited participation in enabling its existence by having seen it. TTYD might be an OK film to someone born after the era which Tom Hanks attempts to convey here through cliché and outright quasi-Beatloid parody, but there are films aplenty from the 1960's that pretty much tell the same stale ""unknowns-make-it-big"" saga with far more authenticity and sincerity, simply by having been made during that time. Not even as believable as a film with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, nor as musically sophisticated."
5,"This is a great movie, one of the best I've seen for awhile!","This movie is so good,that my 5 year daughter,watched it at least 7 times within the first week my family watched it. I even bought the cassette tape. She knows alot of the words from all the songs. GREAT MOVIE with Tom Hanks, Liv Tyler, etc."
4,Great Music.....,"I saw this movie several years ago and wanted to get the DVD, but I couldn't remember the name of it. When I saw it at Amazon I was extremely happy and ordered it right away. It's a feel good movie."
1,Not what I expected,"I agree with the other reviews, they run big. I should have bought 1/2 size smaller. I had to buy some insoles to walk comfortably but even so it feels loose. I like the style but I need to have a shoe that makes me feel safe when I walk."
4,I like these,"I purchased these last year for my daughter; after reading the first review I thought I should rebut part of her comment; true, they do run large, however, my daughter has never complained about them and she looks good in them"
2,disappointed...HOWEVEER...,"I should have looked more carefully. This is the size of a ""free give-away size"".Why was it shipped from England? Why did it cost so much? Very disappointed. The cream lasted for about 4 applications. Certainly not worth the price nor the quality of the product! There is no way I could comment on the worthiness of the product when you get such a small amount."
4,"Cute, challenging game","This is a fun game for Christians or anyone. It is the basic game of match 3 or more blocks in a row to destroy them. You have to do a lot of damage and quick to destroy the Wall of Jericho or your ""followers"" will leave....which means game over. My husband and I have pleasure competing for the highest score."
5,Walls of Jericho is the BEST!,this fame is so much fun for the whole family! We all playt the ame from ages 10 - and up!!LOVE IT!!!
1,Very disappointed!,"I have several other pieces in this collection which I absolutely love. When I was able to find the salad server set at Amazon.com for a cheaper price, I couldn't wait to order it. When it came, I was more than disappointed. The set looked like it had either been 100 years old and was all tarnished (which it is not supposed to ever do), or someone had bought it, tried to clean it with a polish (again, something that is not supposed to be done) and it wore away the finish. I also bought the medium size bowl to go with the salad server set, and when that came, it was all scratched! Needless to say, I returned both for a full refund immediately. Obviously, the cheaper price meant cheaper quality in this case...and it wasn't dirt cheap to begin with, I still had paid $75.00 for it, compared to $150.00 that it is sold in stores for."
4,Sure beats using two plates,"The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the hinge side thins the tortilla more than the other. When this is undesirable, just rotate the tortilla 180 degrees and press again. Well made, and can't see why this won't be a lifetime purchase. Not suitable for flour tortillas, as the elasticity of the wheat dough requires rolling rather than pressing."
3,Shipment and initial use,"I received the lawnmower in perfect condition ready to have the gas and oil put in, raise the handle and start mowing. I have only used it once but was amazed at how easy it was to turn corners with it and the speed with which it moved. Good walking pace for me. I was mowing high grass with the mulch mode in use and it did overheat. I will use the bag for the rest of the high grass and hope that fixes the overheating problem. I am very pleased with this lawnmower"
2,Bad Shipment,"The shipment of this lawnmower was awful. I uncrated the box to find the cap to the quart of oil that came with the lawmower cracked, and oil strewn everywhere along the inside of the box and mower. But the worst of it came when I noticed the right rear wheel askew and immovable. After taking off the wheel, I noticed that the wheel axel was bent on a 45 degree angle. I was ready to send his mower back to Amazon.com, but noted the return policy that stated that anything containing oil or flammables cannot be returned. I was able to repair the axel myself to the point where the wheel can now turn. I've learned my lesson never to buy something like this online again."
2,Shipping Poor,The box was total open when the mower arrived. It looked as if the lawn mower fell out and was put back into the box. Oil came out and clogged the air filter so the mower was not able to start. I replaced the air filter and the mower now works 100% but I would be wary buy items like this online again.
1,Handle comes off,"One of the reasons I ordered this pump was that it comes with the ridged stoppers, which actually work. Unfortunately when I first tried it the handle just popped off. I'm returning it in favor of the cheaper plastic pump, which at least has a molded handle that won't come apart."
3,its... okay one.,"it works okay for the purpose but if you looking for fancy quality as WMF brand product you will be disappointed.it's chrome finished but the material is plastic inside.as soon as you see this, you can tell this is made with cheap material.i'm not sure if this worth with price as listed."
3,It's good but not great,"This works ok.ProsDecent size.Looks NicePlenty of holes to let food breath and cool/drain properlyConsNeeds lifts so the bottom of it does not hold in water and can drain all the water out. As a result you have to pick it up to let it all water flow out and if you forget you food will be sub merged in a little water.Pasta/Potatoes sticks in the holes and if left out for an hour or so hard to clean. Especailly Pasta.No Handels to pick it upSize is not the best for many different tasks.Overall it works, but I am getting rid of it for a different one."
5,Right Conception of Sin,"This has been a very helpful book and helps us to understand more fully just what sin is and the consequences of it. Richard Taylor, the author, is very well informed about the Scriptures, Highly recommend."
5,My Morning Delight With Chai...,"I have found so much delight in reading the book, ""Chai"" by Lailee Bakhtiar van Dllen. Her talent for poetry is well reflected in this book. Her poems are beautiful and her words are honest, elegant and spirit-filled. They bring to mind pictures of the past, of Iran and the lives and lessons learned through her life and the Bible. Many warm thoughts come to mind when reading Chai - I highly recommend this book! One of my many favorite poems in Chai is ""Turquoise Chair"" which shares the imagination of the soul moving from chair to chair...lovely..."
4,An excellent creature flic,"This is much better than average, with a real shock about a quarter way in. It is moody, well scripted and paced (edited) and well acted. One of the best of this ilk (gargoyles/dragons/flying monsters)."
3,Love Eric Balfour!,"I purchased this DVD as a joke for a sister that loves Eric Balfour. It's a ""b"" movie with some surprizes. Eric is fun to watch, and has a good time with it."
4,Can I rate four for effort?,"Much like Carny, this movie tries to do something different than average Syfy-commissioned films. There's less creature attacks, lower body count (less characters period), and considerably more focus on mystery and such, even though the audience already knows what's going on.Among the very few Syfy-commissioned films that tries to be spooky.One question though: does France even have churches."
3,"Lehane Avoids Sophomore Slump, But Not Third Book Slump","_Darkness, Take My Hand_ was an amazing book--how often does a writer not only avoid the dreaded ""sophomore slump,"" but actually turns out an even better, stronger book? Unfortunately, he doesn't avoid the slump altogether, he just delays it a bit. _Sacred_ is something of a disappointment after the one, two punch of his first two Kenzie/Gennaro books. It isn't as dark and there's quite a bit more humor on display--maybe that's the problem? I wasn't looking for Carl Hiaasen--I mean, when I pick up a Lehane, I'm expecting the dark, grim approach to life that the first two books set as the standard. This isn't a bad book--it is incredibly fast-moving (I still can't believe I read the whole thing in one day)--but it is probably the weakest book by Lehane that I've read (besides the first two Kenzie/Gennaro's, I've also read the amazing _Mystic River_--not nominated for the Edgar? He wuz robbed!)."
3,Mediocre,"Not bad but doesn't hold a candle to Robert Parker, Robert Crais or ev en Harlan Coben(who in my eyes is the true master of suspense). Story itself is interesting but gets more boring as the book goes on. Patrick has too many moral issues for a tough guy(which is what he is supposed to be) and he is always hell bent on doing the right thing(yawn!). Angela can't get over her issues with her husband who used to beat the crap out of her. Geez, get a grip already. Blah, blah, blah."
3,"Not his best work, but stick with it","Maybe Lehane was tired when he put this one together. I don't know. Sacred is not in the same league as A Drink Before the War or Darkness, Take My Hand, but it does move fast and gives us some more character development of Angie, Patrick and a bit more of Bubba. That character development alone, is handy when you get to his later novels (Gone, Baby, Gone and Prayers for Rain). Although the story is on the predictable side, we still come away knowing Lehane's main cast a bit better and he's always good for the sharp-as-a-tack wit. I absolutely love the way his books make me laugh -- not something you expect in this genre."
3,Not One of Lehane's Better Efforts,"I found this book somewhat one-dimensional. It was a good yarn, but not as compelling as most of Lehane's other books. I felt some of the characters lacked credibility. I found some parts of the plot too cliched. Still, even with these faults, it held my attention and it was mildly enjoyable. After all,I love Lehane's books, because he usually delivers in spades. But this one, I dunno, I just found it lacking."
4,Fast paced and interesting,"""Sacred"" is a book that moves along at a satisfyingly quick pace. Even if you get tired of a few improbable action sequences and somewhat cheesy dialogue, there's enough going on in the novel to keep you from putting it down. A constantly twisting storyline as well as a real chemistry between the main characters Patrick and Angie distract the reader from the few faults in the novel. Also, LeHane doesn't depend on his previous ""A Drink Before the War"" or ""Darkness Take My Hand"" to explain the backgrounds of either character. A complete novice to his books will have no problem following along, as each of their prior escapades is summarized efficiently in the pages of ""Sacred"". In the end, you are left with a quick read that leaves you craving for more."
3,A step below Darkness Take my Hand,"Sacred is Lehane's third novel and it is good and entertaining but fails to live up with the action and suspense established by his second novel, Darkness Take my Hand.Patrick and Angie are detectives back on the case trying to find the missing daughter of a rich tycoon. The title of the book and the summary on the jacket lead me to believe this story would revolve around a religious cult. But it doesn't at all. Patrick and Angie don't know who to trust as they follow lead after lead looking for Desiree, the daughter.This entertaining book has plenty of twists. It seems to be sort of a let up from the last one where the case invaded the personal lives of the two detectives. Some of this story almost plays out like a comedy, and it lacks the gritty realism that made Lehane's last book so enjoyable.After four Lehane novels, I have to admit he is a good author and I plan on reading his last two soon."
4,"Good, not great","The first Dennis LeHane book I ever read was ""Shutter Island"" which I absolutely LOVED. What an jolt that story was. I followed it up by reading ""Mystic River"" which was also very good. I was expecting that same type of story/writing with this one and it just wasn't the same.I picked this up off a clearance rack for $1 not realizing it was the third in a series. Mr. LeHane does a good job of bringing you up to speed on the characters and I was able to enjoy the book even with skipping the first two. I enjoyed the settings of Boston and the Sarasota/Bradenton area so that added to the book in my opinion.This book, while good, did not have the writing quality or the story ""punch"" that the other two books I read had. It was more along the lines of a James Patterson, quick read that was enjoyable but not outstanding. I still find myself several years later thinking about ""Shutter Island"" and I am sure this book will be forgotten within days. A really good beach read, but not much else."
3,get the facts straight,"Okay, so I'm a fan, despite all the ludicrous macho and macha. But, after suffering through the lapses in editing and factual errors in the last one, I've decided enough is enough: Bob Dylan never did an album called ""Positively Fourth Street"", thereby invalidating the plot point which depends on it. Doesn't this author -- or any editor at his publishing house -- believe in fact-checking"
2,"A star dropped off for each book, ""scattered"" not ""sacred""","Not much story to describe, just alot of poorly stuck pieces. A carpet woven with silly string. I was happy to see I'm not alone in my disappointment with this fantasy rendition. However, I see some who liked it, but thank goodness for Spencer and Hawk Boston will remain. Bubba Rogowski, indeed. I felt Lehanes beginning statement that he saw no story here was an extremely accurate one, the friends who said otherwise were not. No, Elvis Cole here, only a foulmouthed crybaby, with a bimbo for a partner and an imprisoned scuzzball lowlife as a friend. ""Baby I'm gone"", too many great writers await and time is too short.I suggest Lehane use his creative writing degree and apply it toward fantasy science fiction, or comic books."
2,Weak plot plus smart-aleck sleuth equals a dull book,"I read Lehane's first two books and enjoyed them immensely. But Sacred was so bad that I am very angry that I wasted several hours reading it. The plot seemed to be an afterthought to the smart-aleck, wisecracking dialog of Kenzie. I was also turned off by the condescending put-downs of Florida. Lehane's provincial adoration of Boston detracts from his stories."
3,Not as good as I would have liked,"This novel was not as gripping as Lehane's previous work, 'Darkness, Take My Hand"". At some point the dialog started to sound a bit like the caveman-like grunts and cliche retorts that you find in John Grisham or Vince Flynn's books. I'm expecting better with Lehane's next novel... hopefully."
3,"below my expectation. Not as good as Drink before War, and no Way near Darkness","After I get hunk up with the first two novels, a Drink before war and Darkness take my hand. I cannot wait to read Sacred. Sacred is nothing near the first two books. Darkness take my hands is the best so far. I am very disappointing with Sacred. The story did not grab my attentions and is very week.I heard the next one Gone, Baby Gone, is the best. I am skeptical now after I read Sacred. but I am still looking forward to read it, because I do like the first two books very much."
4,Very Underrated,"Most readers don't rate this one as high as DTMYH, GBG, or ADBTW. But this is still a great novel. We get to see more of Angela as the badass. Plus, this novel had a ongoing message that was literally spelled out at the end: the pretense of beauty is suspect, but true beauty is sacred. LOVED IT!"
3,disappointing,"After having read ""A Drink Before the War"" and ""Darkness TakeMy Hand"", I was disappointed with ""Sacred"". It seems to me thatPatrick and Angie have lost their edge. After I read the previous 2 books I was left thinking about myself and my morals and the others around me. The characters in this book were shallow and while it was a good read it was not affecting or memorable. I am now reading ""Gone Baby Gone"" and I hope Lehane is back to form."
4,great,"great book, hilarious, more so than his others, true its slightly more light than his usual books but its still goodalso to the guy who says that dylan has no album called positively 4th street. The guy in the book said ""look for songs, not albums"". So when they found positively 4th street it is because they were looking for the names of dylan SONGS. And yes, dylan has a song called that."
5,Funny and Fast Paced,"A completely enjoyable read. I'm a sucker for the wise-cracking detective genre, so Lehane's Kenzie and Gennaro really make me laugh. I'm reading the series in order, and they just keep getting better."
3,Unexceptional Mystery Dulls the Senses,"I had never heard of Dennis Lehane when I read a pre-publication release of this book a few months back. After finishing it, I didn't really care if I ever heard of him again.It's not that the book is bad. It's certainly readable. It is also entirely unexceptional, dull, and cliche, with flat characters and poor dialogue.If you are interested in reading a book like this, I suggest you check out Lawrence Block, Robert B. Parker, or John D. MacDonald instead. They are all far superior."
2,Sacred is a nice read for the subway commute home.,"While I enjoyed the red herrings thrown here and there and the dialogue between the heros, I was disappointed with the ending. Kenzie and Angie are characters the reader can identify with, but the monster that is Desiree is never quite justified or explained fully for my tastes. If she had shown more avarice throughout, or if the origins of her promiscuity were defined, she might have been more believable. Maybe some insight about her childhood would have helped. The one insight we do get is around her relationship with her mother; unfortunately, it wasn't enough to pull it off."
3,Disappointing.,"The characters, especially, Desiree, are cardboard cutouts compared to those in his previous books. The overblown plot simply careens to an end. It sort of reads like one of those Bruce Willis movies, cars crashing, people screaming. I let the book sit around with only ten pages left to read. Thats a bad sign."
2,THERE'S NOTHING SACRED,"The characters were immature and boring, and like the plot, too much formula. I was disappointed reading ""Sacred"", especially because it was the Mystery Editor's choice! The reference to Dylan's album was incorrect, but no big factor in the book. Sometimes facts are misstated; however, the content made me ""yawn"" and I could barely get through Lehane's latest effort. I doubt if I will ever read another of his books. Since the Mystery Editor chose this title at Amazon Books, I doubt if you will print this. Where was his head? Really bad stuff, but at least I got it off my chest. I hated this boring book..."
3,Good seller,The seller was very responsive when I brought it to his attention that the book was apparently lost in the mail. He gave me a refund immediately.randy
3,"Not as Taunt as ""Darkness Take My Hand""","I'm hooked on Lehane, however this episode lacks the tension of ""Darkness Take my Hand"", and the usual turn of the phrase that was first introduced in ""A Drink Before the War"". I suspect this is a ""watershed"" story for the author, as he tries to start writing himself a pension though creating a series.(P.S. Patrick drives a '59 Porsche in ""Drink"" which becomes a '63 in ""Darkness"". Also, I believe his crib moves from the second floor to the third in these stories.)"
3,don't know,I must have bought this as a gift for someone. I haven't read it but I remember it arrived in pretty good shape.
4,PRETTY DOG-GONE GOOD!!!!!,"Dennis Lehane has another good one in Scared. My only complaint is the book was a little to long. It had about 70 more pages than last one. I think some of the talking could have been left out, the action woudl have moved quicker and it would have been better, but then what do I know? Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro are their usual wise cracking selves. Trevor Stone hires them to find his daughter, or does he want her found? Kenzie and Gennaro go from Boston to Florida and back again. People are getting killed all aroung them but the somehow come through it alive. Being shot at, car wrecks, being buried alive, gased, all just in a days work for these two. The ending is very good, I liked what they did. Hope they can hold it together now that they are lovers. Really liked it better when they were just best of friends. I would suggest reading this series in order if you read it. It will be much better."
3,Not as good as Lehane's previous books,"Am I the only one getting the impression that Dennis Lehane is running out of steam? His main protagonists - Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro - are sympathetically portrayed; but that's about it in a book with a threadbare plot and unbelievable villains and setpieces. For example, was Desiree Stone really a victim of incest? There are too many loose threads in this book, unlike the tightly constructed plots of his previous works. I have more sympathy for Bubba Rogowski than for Kenzie's philosophical meanderings!"
4,Success Again,"Intriguing problems dissected and solved to satisfaction. I enjoy the thought processes which lead to conclusions and actions. A bit of a stretch at times, but entirely forgiveable. Another page turner."
4,Great thriller,Dennis Lehane's books never disappoint. My only complaint is that I didn't get much sleep while reading this one because I couldn't put it down.
3,Sacred,Product was more worn and had a mildew smell. The binding was alright but my husband could not read it because of the smell.
1,Thumbs down,"I give this books a thumbs down. While some of the ideas (different forms of love, individuality, and stretching the limits of socially accepted behavior, life and death) were interesting, the way they were conveyed in this book was not effective for me. None of the characteristics were likable, nor was I able to feel for any of them. The book starts out with a woman having sex with a dolphin, and ends with unexpected deaths. While some smaller sections were enjoyable to read, I generally found myself wishing this experience was over."
1,Worst book ever written,"please, do not waste your time. This book is disgusting. Dolphin erotica and suicide? Seriously? Yes, you will find those in this book.. and they're not funny... or artfully done... just gross."
3,NOT general purpose gun...Only Small Areas,Not easy to workPay very close attention to directionS!!Clean thoroughly after use or you will never be able to use again!!Glad we bought the cheap one...
2,Eh.....,"Seems like a decent paint sprayer... but... in the instruction manual, at one point, it says to move the ""set screw"" from the top to bottom hole. Mine didn't come with a set screw, although the screw holes are there. Also, unless you have an accessory kit/set of adapters with your compressor, get one. The paint sprayer is not set up for a quick connect and you'll either need to change the fittings or find a coupler that works. I'll add more to the review once I actually get to use the product...."
5,LISTEN TO YOUR PODCAST IN YOUR CAR RADIO,"BUY IT, IT IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT. BRING YOUR FAVORITE PODCAST EVERYWHERE YOU GO WHEN YOU TRAVEL, WHEN YOU GO TO WORK..."
3,Great as long as it lasts,"I bought this system for myself last christmas, about 12 months ago. The sound was great, I even played with the Karoke. The alarm worked fine. I play mostly CD's and the 3 cd changer worked fine. I tried the tape player and that's good also. However, the CD player just gave up the ghost. Don't know why. It tries to start but fails. I know they only warranty the units for one years but I think they should last longer than that."
4,Water down version,"Not as strong as the original one I bought in Oregon and fell in LOVE with! Everything looks the same, including the picture on the bottle; however, I believe it's a 'water-down' version than the one directly from Paris, France. I still like it, but not as much.....so I am keeping it because it's hard to find anywhere."
3,smells like toilet paper,"I don't mean to be too critical with my title, but it's the truth... I have a very sensitive nose, and it took me a while to place it, but some toilet paper is violet-scented. This is violet perfume, hence the two smell alike. I guess I just did not know what I was in for. If your mind doesn't make the same association between the two, go ahead and buy it. It's really a nice violet smell! It just reminds me of T.P."
4,Noble House is a first class drama,"Aside from a really good story, the best thing in the film were the actors, all of whom were very believable in their respective roles. Brosnan was outstanding. While the movie is long, you are so engrossed in the story you don't really notice. After having spent some time in Hong Kong, it was easy to accept the highly competitive business climate portrayed in the film. It was a pleasure to see a compelling movie without the usual violence and foul language. I would recommend this film to anyone"
4,Noble House dvd works perfectly and love the story.,"Both dvds work great. Mine had the horse race in it unlike the a review I read where he said it was not in these. Love Pierce in it as tai-pan, gorgeous scenery, followed the book real close so that was good. Very pleased."
5,the bit when......,"the taipan goes to Macau was filmed at our home in Hong Kong.Hope you all enjoy it as much as we do here in Hong Kong.Actually I work for the real Noble House,Jardine Matheson. Martin Barrow. email""mgb@jmgroup.com"""
3,Disc 1 is just not playable,"Having read other, previous feedback complaining about Disc 1 and its defectiveness, I was a bit wary before ordering this DVD. But I went ahead and bought it. Sure enough, my Disc 1 was also defective. Amazon needs to address this issue. We sent the video back for a refund but were still out some ancillary costs.As for the video itself? Very dated. Also the music is too loud on the soundtrack. Pierce is great, as usual, but the acting otherwise is not the greatest."
3,"Great Miniseries, Disappointing DVD","Why do the DVD producers cut favorite scenes out of classic miniseries? This has been a family favorite since it first aired on television, and we have been waiting to purchase it on DVD for years! We would gladly have paid more to have the COMPLETE miniseries. Instead, the DVD producers decided to arbitrarily cut several favorite scenes out of the 2 disc set. The horse race, the trip to China to visit his friend in the China bank... these and several others are gone. I am torn between wanting to return the DVD in protest and promising the production company I will buy it again and pay more if they would only release the original, perfectly wonderful, miniseries. What I won't be doing is buying additional copies of this DVD for friends and family who have long wanted to see it again. They don't deserve such disappointment."
1,Unhappy -- The ste is missing the last tape in the series,I bought this series and only three tapes came. 90 minutes each. Someone made a post that they narrowed the 355 minutes down. I have to say there was no editing they left out the last tape and as a result you miss the enitre climax and ending of the novel. This was extremely frustrating and I would not purchase this product.
5,Clavell's Noble House DVD,I had the VHS version of this and was very excited when it came out on DVD. It is one of my favorite Clavell books and movies. Well done.
5,Noble House,I just love this movie. Pierce Brosnan is a great Tia Pan. The scenery in this movie is wonderful with great photography. I also enjoy the author Clavell I have read other books he has written and they are always written with great passion and drama. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
5,before james bond,The story played close to the book. That was in large part due to the author's contribution. This tv mini series was enjoyed by all the adults in the house. There were some sub plots left out. If you have never read the book you will find that the tv version plays smoothly and keeps the audience engaged and entertained while keeping the main plot on course.
4,Brought back my memories,"First time I watched this was on Hong Kong tv in the late 80s, liked it back then even though I was just in the teens. Glad to see I can finally buy the flick and watch it again. This is a great TV movie, it's like the Wall Street (the movie) of orient. The transfer is excellent, though I was a bit disappointed with the mono audio track. What's the point of Dolby when it's just mono? Therefore the 4 star."
2,"DVD had a ""skip"" in it.","Certainly not the fault of Amazon, the second of four included DVD's had a flaw it it that wouldn't let the player go forward - I had to do a scene selection to the next scene, then back up to just AFTER where the flaw occurred. Annoying, but not a disaster. This was a new DVD set."
1,I can't stop cringing.,"If you saw watched this production in the late 80's then maybe you loved it, but I am just watching it for the first time today and I can hardly believe how cheesy, campy, and cliche it is. Some of the worst acting, scripting, and directing I've ever seen and it's unbearably dated."
1,If you read the book and loved it you might want to skip this movie.,On the other hand if you haven't read the book and are a fan of Pierce Brosnan you will probably enjoy it. I gave it only one star because of the way they diverged so far from the book. If they had given it another name and hadn't tried to pretend it was the same story I probably would have been fine with it.
1,Incomplete set,I purchased this movie with the expectation that it was the complete film. Instead it comprises only three of the four parts. Buyer beware!
4,One of the trilogy from James Clavell,"Pierce Brosman was just great as the Tia-Pan of the Noble House. Had a problem with the first disk of the set, but Amazon sent another one, no questions asked. Thank you Amazon!"
1,Unhappy,The mvideo was grate what there was of it. I did not get the complet video. I still have not seen the ending. I have also sent emails to the company and no answers.
1,I hate Pierce Brosnan,I hate Pierce Brosnan. He peaked with Remington Steele. I liked the version with the Australian guy better.
1,Incomplete Set,"Unfortunately, the 3 Tape version of ""Noble House"" is incomplete and leaves out the entire climax of the Mini Series.This is terribly disappointing. Saw it on TV and was looking forward to seeing it again, only to find that it leaves you up in the air without an ending."
3,Great (but sadly incomplete) series,"I loved the book, i loved the series on TV and i loved the mini series on VHS... up to the moment, where the series prematurely ended. :-(If you buy this three cassette edition, you will not be able to see it completely, for the last part of the series is missing (which is an outrage, considering the price).I considered sending it back, but i am still hoping to find the last part somewhere.If not... it is the long wait for the DVD ( and THAT one i will certainly buy!!!)"
2,Incomplete Story!,"Although Noble House is one of the GREATEST stories I ever had the pleasure of reading and watching (both, in English and Spanish) let me warn you that the VHS release does NOT include the whole miniseries. I had the opportunity of watching this miniseries complete on TV and let me tell you that the VHS tapes stop when they are at the race track... What happened to rest of the story? On the VHS tapes is only about 2/3 of the story!On the other hand, I would love to see the complete story released on DVD. I would be the first one to buy it!"
2,"Review of DVD, NOT the series!","As has been mentioned before, this series has been cropped to make it fit widescreen TV's. It's been very well done though so if you've never seen it before or you don't remember it on TV you'd never notice! The transfer is pretty good but still a little grainy. The absolute worst thing is the sound, it is HORRIBLE!!! I had to crank up the volume to hear the dialogue then scramble for the remote when the music came blaring out...ugh! I hope the Blu-Ray version addresses this. Still, I enjoyed seeing this old series again and all those new, fresh actors! :D"
5,Easy Decor Idea,"I'd been looking for a simple way to decorate my daughter's bedroom and we loved the bunny idea. When I found these appliques, I was so excited. They are SO incredibly easy to use and if you don't like the placement, just peel them off and reapply. A great selection of pictures - and good sized - I used them as a wall border in her room. Definitely recommend this product!"
3,"NOT THE BEST,NOT THE WORST","THIS GAME HAS CHEAP 2-D GRAPHICS,POOR GAMEPLAY. BUT IF YOU LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW JACK YOU WILL LIKE THIS GAME. THE BIGGEST REASON WHY I DON'T LIKE THIS GAME IS BECAUSE THE GAME IS TO FAST. AND IT'S NONE LIKE WHO WANT'S TO BE A MILLONARE. TAKE MY ADVICE AND DON'T BUY THIS GAME."
3,Short story collection,"From what I understand this book is going to be released again but the copy I got was from a recent goodreads contest. It was published originally in 1987. The copy is somewhat yellowed as it is 25 years old. As far as the content the is one 50 page work and about 70 pages of short stories. I think the longer work called ""Mexico"" is the best of the bunch. It is about a young couple from the states that go to Mexico primarily to look for drugs. The lady starts to sour on the relationship and is attracted to an American who is playing on a minor league baseball team there. These stories are a slice of life in the 80's if that is what you are looking for. The author has not written all that much since that time and is twenty five years older at this point. Some good and fair stories."
1,A lousy book,"Only this liberal, star struck writer would somehow consider Jimmy Carter a great president. 21% inflation, oil crisis, hostages in Iran, forget about them, Jimmy was great but we are too stupid to know it."
3,Wrong Specs and Bad Customer Service,"I bought an Acer notebook just to find out that the specs were wrong. The PC was sold as 1 GB RAM but instead it came with 786 MB, I researched the Acer PC online and found out I was not the only one who had this problem.Another thing, the HD was formatted in FAT32 instead of NTFS. This is not much of problem now but it might one when I get the Vista upgrade disk they promise and try to upgrade the OS System. Also, the keyboard is very noisy.Now the worst thing, it's the customer service. Practically non-existent and this is why I gave it 3 stars. Good luck calling them and be very patient if you send an email.Aside from that, the pc it's reliable at a very good price. I guess you get what you paid for."
4,excellent series start,"I downloaded this for free recently, and very glad I did. I am now a bona fide Dirk and Steele fan! This had action, romance, excitement, adventure, and cracking good writing (which is sadly darn rare these days...sigh). And from I hear the books only get better, which thrills me to no end. My only quibble was that the romance part seemed to start a little too soon; I wanted them to delve more into trust first. But I still really enjoyed this book. I read a lot (A LOT), and I absolutely will put down a book if it doesn't hold my interest. This one held my interest through to the end. Off to add all the other books in this series to my TBR pile."
3,Book is in German?,"I went to the take a Look inside and picked the surprise me. Well, I was as it is not in English."
5,A Must Read !!,"I absolutely loved this book !! I am a huge fan of Christine Feehan so when I saw her reccomendation on the cover I gave this new author a chance. I am so happy I did.Dela and Hari were both so well written, you were able to embrace the story and what they were going/had gone through. Dela has a great ""family"" and I truly enjoyed them being such a part of this book.Ms Liu has a terrific writing style."
4,So much better than the plot summary indicates!,"I've read Liu's Hunter Kiss series and became interested in her previous works. When I initially read some of the plot summaries, which read something like: while on vacation in China, blond American Dela Resse purchases a mysterious box, which turns out to hold Hari, a tiger shape shifter who will fulfill all Dela's desires and grant all her wishes, but who really ends up enslaved? I was a little put off by the heavily romantic aspect, but I should have known Liu's work would be so much more than a trite romance novel. Tiger Eye contains the same depth of vivid detail and complexity of character that Liu's later works have. While there is a strong romance that develops between Dela and Hari, it's well handled and fraught with interesting complications. I enjoyed Tiger Eye and am glad it's a part of a series--I look forward to reading more about Dirk & Steele."
2,This author gets better with experience.,"I actually read this author's most recent book, The Fire King, before coming back to read the first in this series, Tiger Eye. The concept is good but the story and dialog are a bit predictable, the characters are a rather one dimensional, and the romance lacks sexual tension. Even though I say this, it is still worth a read, if for no other reason than to see how this author grows with experience.I read The Fire King first and loved that book. It had everything that this book lacked and it was interesting to see how Liu evolved as an author with time. I'm anxious to read the second book in the series and see the subtle improvements in this author's writing."
3,Tiger Eye,"Dela Reese did have some experience with the out of the ordinary in life, but nothing had prepared her for Hari, a man enslaved and kept trapped jinn fashion in a box for two thousand years. When she buys his box, she accidentally becomes his master, and determines to set him free. If he is strange to her, she is more so to Hari. Never in his aeon long imprisonment has he known kindness at a master's hand. Before either know what is happening, they are in love, but the man who placed Hari in the box wants him back, and will stop at nothing, murder included, to reclaim the shape shifter. It is a race against time to set Hari free forever, and stop the evil master's plan.*** Combining the legend of the jinn with that of the selkies, then setting the entire thing in a very exotic location, Ms Liu has created an unusual novel that zips along at a rapid pace. ***"
1,I guess I am not ...,into the whole idea of time travel. The idea that this gorgeous warrior guy has been around for 2000 years and has never met a kind person is just dumb. The premise of this book reminds me a bit of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Fantasy Lover. Yet in Kenyon's book the hero comes out of a book and not a box. I could not get too far in either book. Too ridiculous for me.
3,TIGER EYE,I READ THIS BOOK AND I REALLY LIKE THE STORY LINE AND COULD SEE WERE THE WRITER HAD A BOOK 2 IN THE WORKS. WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT ELSE COULD HAPPEN IN THE STORY LINE. WOULD BY BOOK 2 IF IT CAME OUT.
2,Trying to give it another chance,"I was told, ""If you like Sherilyn Kenyon, then you'll love Liu."" How wrong was that salesperson! Unfortunately, I had already purchased 4 books. I was surprised to see that those titles were not the first to the series. So I downloaded it on my Kindle and thought there was something wrong with download because of how short the book appeared. nevertheless, I read this book and found it to be hum drum. I never did care for authors that repeat themselves and she does a lot of it. I do not need constant reinforcement or a reminder of how the character feels.Would I recommend this book, absolutely NOT. I do however have to find the other books to just get it out of my systemI totally recommend Sherilyn Kenyon. I have brought in many naysayers with Acheron, a must read."
2,Argh. Emotional overload.,"OK, so I got to about 3/4 of the way through the book, and then I just couldn't take it anymore. The plot and setting of the story is pretty interesting, don't get me wrong, but the execution is quite terrible. I found it all very melodramatic and ""oh-woe-is-me"" through and through. The two main characters, in fact, were very unappealing and wrought with emotional stress that seemed too dramatic to be taken realistically. I don't know. I read Ms. Liu's other book, The Iron Hunt, and liked it quite a bit, and had expected more from this previous series. But, argh, the melodrama just bared on my nerves, until I had to put it down in fear of ripping out my hair or flinging the book out the window at some innocent passersby."
5,Wow.,"Wow. Now I see what everyone was raving about. This is one of those books I was hesitant to read because there was just so much hype about it. But I have to say, the hype was well-deserved.It's the start of a series about characters with a wide variety of paranormal and/or psychic abilities. The heroine, an artist with a psychic affinity for metal, is in China on vacation, where an old woman convinces her to buy a puzzle box, which, when she opens it, contains a shape-shifting warrior who's been cursed to be a slave to the owner of the box. The magi who cursed him is now after both of them, and there's an assassin after her as well."
4,Better than I expected,"Reading the reviews from Amazon, I expected this book to be mediocre and akin to the free romance books available on Kindle. I read one of her books that was part of a compilation (Dark Dreamers) and enjoyed the attention she gives to mixed ethnicity and people who are ""different"" (which is why I decided to take a chance on this book). I have to say that I thought Tiger Eye was good. I read some people complain that she her books are all the same - I haven't read enough to agree or disagree but Tiger Eye was entertaining enough for me to purchase the next in the series :)"
2,Poor quality shoe.,"I had a similar version of this shoe from about 3 years ago that lasted, surprise, 3 years. I bought a pair of these things as replacements... I should have went with my initial instinct. The leather is cheap, the rubber leaves marks on floors, the seams are already busting apart! I walk maybe 1-2 miles a day to work and back and the treads are already wearing thin. I would not recommend these shoes to anyone, what happened to the quality Steve Madden shoe that I used to adore?"
3,Something missing,"Lots of pretty pictures, but no information on zones. Because of cold winters, the zones of each plant is important to me. I have to do additional research to find out if a given plant is suitable for the climate I live in."
1,Stay away from it.,"Does NOT work with Vista, despite what their website says and all the additional downloads required.Buggy. Crashes. Takes forever to boot up. Interface is unusable.I expected a much more professional program for my money."
1,Bicycle Solitaire,"This is nowhere close to the program I had on my old computor. The graphs are bad. It has seperate divisions, in each there are more then one game, but it is the same game over and over just diffent titles"
1,Hard to Review when I still have not Received it !!!!!!!!!!!!,I have sent 2 E-Mails to the provider of this game and its been over a month with NO product and NO reply from the Provider as to its wareabouts.I Would like SOMEONE to reply to me on how to Cancel the order. I do not want the product anymore as I have found another more reliable vendor.
5,very happy with it!,"Very nice and very adjustable, you certainly can't beat it for the price. Yes, I would and will recommend it to my friends."
1,Not an HVLP Gun as stated,The description talks about the gun being an HVLP type. Well it isnt and that is what we need to meet the enviroment regulations in our state. So I had to return the 2 I bought....it seems that it would be simple to accurately describe what you are selling....right? If you need HVLP stay awya from this product because it isnt.
3,"Disappointed with ring, but not with company",I was a little disappointed when I recieved this ring. It does not look like it does in the pictures. The stones around the base of the center stone are way smaller than what they appear in the picture. Some of the stones were crooked and the settings bent. It looked fake and poorly crafted. The company was very nice about replacing the ring. I decided to go with the 1/2 carat princess cut ring. I recieved it very quickly and was extremely happy with it. Much better quality and easily passes as the real deal.
4,Cute!,"I recieved this ring about a month ago, I had got the wrong size at first lol but they were nice enough to let me exchange it. Its original and I get SOOOO many ppl saying you so lucky and that its really beautiful, You really cant even tell that its fake. My fiancee doesnt really like me wearing it to much because ppl might notice that its fake, but you be suprised how many ppl like it!!!"
3,good,ring was not all that great. middle stone is a nice size but the ring did not match up to the picture to me. Overall was a nice ring.
1,Think twice,I have not used this grill in a long time because it deteriorated quickly. The outside discolors quickly from heat and on my covered porch pieces rusted soon.
4,Weathercrane Skwurrylfell: Haptastic and Spontoastic Without Fledge!,"Did Alvin obviate? No. The book is fine reading, stiff countenance, furrowed brow, ""hmmm""s sprinkled and glasses toyed. I concur with other assessments composed in this forum; insightful but ill-named. The Future is Not Shocked. The caffeine is flowing too fast for catatonia. We ride a different manner of whirlwind.I recommend the book for the thinker's paperback collection. Thoroughly fascinating and hard-edged."
4,Future Shock,I haven't re-read this book yet. I enjoyed it when I read it years ago and look forward to reading it again soon.
3,Non Fiction,"Toffler's Future Shock is something similar to what science fiction writers have discussed many times. What happens when you throw advanced technology and concepts at a more primitive people (human/alien/mineral/vegetable) or whatever.Here he is talking about us, and the seeming increasing pace of change, and the general inability of people to keep up with it. While this may be true for some, being in his 35 years ahead future now, with all the people on the planet wandering around with mobile phones, is this really the case for mankind in general?"
4,Shocked and Amazed,"When I first started to read this book I had no idea when it was written. The relevence of the subject matter to today made me feel that the book was just recently composed. What a shock to learn that it was written 30 years ago. While not all of his predictions have come true, it is truly amazing how much he got right.This book takes you on a trip from where we've been to where we are going. It explaines why the social unrest we have been experiencing has taken the form it has. Toffler also tries to give us some solutions on how to cope with an ever changing world. Unfortunatly we are still too technocratic and econocentric to have these solutions applied."
5,AN AMERICAN CLASSIC - A MUST READ!,"One of Toffler's early works, it is a classic, and will never be obselete.It is a must read. Toffler identified issues of change and how change affects every aspect of society. It is a must read for anyone interested in Sociology or Economics. He also writes in a style that is interesting and easy to understand. You will not be disappointed.This work is foundational to the social sciences. ALL of his works are vital reading. I wish that he would grapple with the current issues facing America."
2,Sadly Disappointed...................:-(,"I too ordered this book before publication, anxiously awaiting for it to arrive. Unwrapping the packaging with anticipation, I was greeted with a beautiful looking book. However, upon opening it and reading it, I became so depressed! This book, like the earlier reviewer claims, appears to be a ""thrown-together book"" with old, unfresh ideas. The publisher and author are trying to jump on the current trend of sketchbook journaling. How unfortunate. I'm returning my copy."
3,Disappointing,"I eagerly waited several months for Claudia Nice's latest book to arrive, and was disappointed with the content. It's a scattered book, without a clear focus or vision. The book is full of Nice's work, exclusively, but it lacks freshness and inspiration, as if her editor had said, ""Hey, art journals are hot... let's go through your material and publish a book!""If you are an experienced journal writer and artist, you may find this a disappointment, too. Those new to the subject would probably find this a good introduction, though Jason Thompson, Clare Walker Leslie, and Dan Price's books are far more inspiring. This one is disappointing; it lacks freshness, inspiration, and point of view."
3,Not the 'Journal',"Really, this book is good. But to tell you the truth, there's notmuch of a 'journal' enthusiasm than I wanted. If you're lookingfor how to draw, what you need type of book, than this will bea good book for you. I recommend Pencil Dancing or Making Pearls."
4,Great way to make a wand disappear,"This is quite a nice piece of magic. The wand body is black and the tips are silver (chrome). It comes with enough refills for 12 performances. Each time the wand is made to disappear, one refill is used. It also comes with a duplicate solid wand to be used as the ""reappearing"" wand after the first one vanishes. The solid wand is very nice and solid (although mine had a chip in it which I had to repair). Not only can the wand disappear, but it can also be made to transform to silks after being wrapped in paper and torn up. The quality is very good and the price is reasonable. Refills are not expensive."
3,Ok for the money I paid,"My bought this for my 3-year old daughter, she played for a few days and got tired of it and went back to her Dora's doll house, which is much much more durable and fun than this."
2,Cheap toy,My 3 year old daughter recieved this as a Christmas gift. She played with it until it fell apart. It is very poorly made. It does fold up but only once after it is played with it tends to not fold so easily. She played with it for one day and now it sits in the closet. Not a good toy.
3,Almost surprised,"I have to admit, when my daughter opened this for her 5th birthday, I thought, ""(...), another piece of junk My Little Pony toy"". However, other than the heart clasp falling off IMMEDIATELY (I don't think it even made it out of the box), it's fairly durable and my daughter and 18 month old son love playing with it. I don't understand why they didn't interlock the discs and make all three spin; maybe to teach waiting for your turn. We are on our second castle and after using no less than four hot glue sticks on it, it works fine. I don't have anything to say about the little pieces that came with the studio because I pitched them as choking hazzards for my son. The My Little Pony ponies are great, but the playsets and accessories are total junk and the manufacturer should be ashamed."
2,Not much to this toy....,"I bought this toy for both my 3 year old daughter and my 5 year old niece for Christmas. As another reviewer noted on here, the handle fell off immediately, although it does snap back on. The sides that open up on either side have fallen off several times as well. I would say this toy is not particularly durable or well made. I was under the impression that this toy did more than it does. There are only three functions: one of the three center circles turns around and plays music, and there's two doodads on either side that pop open when you hold the pony's paw upto it. My daughter does seem to like it, but I am disappointed with it. I can see this going into the back of the closet within a month!"
3,Do Not Buy,"This is a very cute toy while it is in the box. Once you take it out, it is a nightmare. The heart clasp fell off in the first 5 minutes. The sides fell off just as quickly. Only one pony can dance at a time. I would definately not recommend this toy to anyone until the manufacturer designs it better."
1,Falls Apart,"I will never buy another My Little Pony Castle or other play set. Last year my daughter received the Castle for Christmas and this year she received the Dance studio. In both cases these toys were not durable in the least. They have been a source of frustration for my daughter and especially me, as I am the one who fixes and repairs these every five minutes. We love the ponies but will never waste money on cheap plastic play sets that fall apart the moment you look at them ever again. Save your money and buy something more durable."
3,"Fun, but not for heavy play","The kids loved this thing because of the twirling action of the platforms you can set the ponies on. They would push the button and watch their toys spin around. The clasp that holds the toy together for storage kept falling off and the sides that pull out keep falling off, but they are easy to snap back on. It gets annoying having to put all the stuff back together and there were small parts that could be a choking hazard."
4,"Fun, but occaisionally frustrating","My daughter also received it for her 4th b-day and LOVES playing with it. It does fall apart easily and the back wall of it (the part that is vertical when it is open for play) falls backwards with just the slightest bump which she finds frustrating becasue it messes up ""her decorations"" - how she set up the ball. The other thing she finds very frustrating is that only one of the three dance platforms spins - all three turn around the floor, but only one also spins. If you have a child who spends much of her imaginative play time setting up and arranging all the pieces perfectly, do not get this toy - it will frustrate her.She does not play with it nearly as much as she plays with the castle. Although I am happy enough with it, it is not a must-have toy, in my opinion."
5,4 Yr. Old Loves It,"I decided on this for my daughters 4th bday after reading not so good things about the castle, which is what she really wanted. She fell in love the dance studio as soon as we opened it. It was very easy to assemble. She loves putting ponies on the turn tables and watching them ""dance"". Some pieces do pop off occasionally, but they just as easy to pop right back on. When she's done playing, all pieces, plus a few additional ponies fit right inside the dance studio which folds into a neat little case. A must have for any pony lover."
4,My little Ponys are a 4 year olds good friend,My 4 and 2 year olds love my little pony's and this was a great set for them to play with
2,Poorly made,My daughter received this yesterday as a xmas present and the moment she opened up the heart that is supposed to lock and keep it closed the heart fell off and she got upset that she broke it. She also received an extra pony to go with it and like the previous person said it doesnt spin like the one it comes with. So she played with it for 5 minutes and now she is done. I would not suggest this toy.
4,Very pretty scarf,I am an amateur --just a cardio class with belly dancing. This scarf is very pretty and has a nice jingle!
4,Who dosent like a Monk Sleuth?,"I had the best of both worlds with this series, Knights and a who done-it. Can you ask for anything better?"
5,Cadfael,"The series is great! Having been to England and seen Shrewsberry (where it takes place) and read the books, I like the job they did on the show."
2,Enjoyed Greatly and Very Frustrated!!,"We had been slowly working through the first season of Cadfael and soon after we watched episode 9 the rest of the videos became unavailable through Prime. I have tried to find another avenue to express my frustration with this but decided this would be the easiest way. The videos are very well done, a little dated, but very enjoyable. If I was just rating the videos I would rate them four stars. I am very sad that the remainders are unavailable and would like to encourage Amazon to restore them!"
3,"Good DVD set, but wrong zone","The set of Cadfael DVDs are good, but they were coded for North America and didn't play on my DVD players (coded for Australia). In the end I found a computer that would play them."
5,Wonderful stories,"Watching the series made me head to the library and check out Ellis Peters' wonderful books. Cadfael is a complex and tremendously appealing character. Derek Jacobi, as always, is superb."
5,A Different kind of Investigator in 12th Century England,"I was really pleased with this DVD set of all 13 Brother Cadfael mysteries. I had read many of the books that the series is based on. Derek Jacobi is outstanding as Brother Cadfael, the former crusader , herbalist and monk. The producers of this series do an excellent job of making the viewer feel like they are in 12th Century England. The writing is superb and all the performances including the small roles are excellent.In the 21st century it is nice to visit the 12th century to see how things were handled . The value of land and the power of the Catholic Church are portrayed as they were. The mysteries are complex and captivating at the same time.The Brother Cadfael mysteries are something to be savored and enjoyed."
3,Why????,"Why? Why? Why? What made these people think they could make any other Gidget movie WITHOUT Sandra Dee? The first Gidget with her was wonderful! I loved it. The whole ocean theme was really great and enjoyable!! Sandra Dee was wonderful. And then they go and make these other two movies without her and they have the nerve to call her Gidget?? How? Why? However, let me tell you, if you forget about the whole ""Gidget"" thing. They are actually really entertaining. Though a bad choice for Gidget, it was really nice. Deborah wasn't good, and neither was Cindy Carol. Cindy was annoying, and Deborah was annoying, but hey they did it. If you are buying this set, because you loved the first Gidget, don't. It is a waste of money. But if you are buying it for a enjoyable movie, and don't know the real Gidget well, they are good. I really did enjoy them!"
4,Yay!,"I've been waiting for the Gidget movies to come out on DVD for a long time, as I no longer have a VHS player. I grew up on these movies, and was particularly obssessed with Gidget Goes Hawaiian. I can't wait to get my pre-ordered copies of the DVD's as I had begun to despair that they would never make the conversion!"
3,Gidget Movies,"For those of you (especially the gals) that were tweens and teens in the 60s, it will bring back all the great memories. Fun! The ones with Sandra Dee were the best of the bunch."
5,Here's another wonderful set of movies!,Here is another movie that needs to be watched over and over again. I am excited to own them know on DVD.
3,GIDGET MOVIES,The first movie is great. The other movies are what I would call knock offs. It's not Gidget if it is not Sandra Dee!!!
1,Butchered movies in a 3 pack,"I was ready to snatch these up....until I saw those dreaded words on the back of the case: ""Full Frame""!These movies were made in the late 50's, early 60's....so there is NO EXCUSE for issuing them in this format. They were shot in 2.35:1 ratio....so almost HALF THE PICTURE IS MISSING!!!This is the second time Columbia Tristar has deeply disappointed me on films I wanted in DVD. The first was their butchering of ""Where Angels Go Trouble Follows"" and ""The Trouble With Angels"".Alas, they will remain missing from my film library until they are released in their proper ratio!!"
1,WIDE SCREEN GIDGET,"I agree with the other reviews. This definately should have been released in it's original aspect ratio. 2.35 and the other two 1.85. If they all were only 1.66 it would not have been so bad. I am certainly waiting till it comes out in wide screen, and hope it does, but will hang on to my video's in the meantime.It would have been a wonderful set to have, VERY DISAPPOINTING."
2,GIDGET COLLECTION,"This could have been the perfect mid-summer diversion. However, someone at Columbia/Tri-Star decided this collection should bereleased in full screen. (The first Gidget feature is in CinemaScope). Such a let-down. I guess I shall just have to keep the Cinemascope tape copy I made off Turner Classic Movies Channel. I hope I can get my money back. Note to those in charge of such things. Full-frame is for VHS. Wide-screen is for DVD. Pass it on."
3,Not totally satisfied with this product (see below),I had problems with this purchase. Two of the dvd' did not work. Gidget goes Hawaii and Gidget goes to Rome. You replaced the dvd's and guess what Gidget goes Hawaiian still doesn't work. Gidget goes to Rome I was able to watch and Gidget starring Sandra Dee.This is the first time I have ever had a problem with Amazon.com.Joann...
2,The Complete Gidget...which was only 2/3 complete !!!!!!!!,The Complete Gidget was not COMPLETE Gidget as the film Gidget Goes to Rome was MISSING!!!!!I would appreciate it if it could be completedO Mcgratn
5,Gidget is picture perfect1,"The Complete Gidget Collection has an amazing top quality of picture, sound and color to it. Highly recommend this version for one's collection of DVDs of 60's hit movies."
4,Surfs up,After reading all the reviews before buying this I was a little concerned about the quality of what was to come. I have no issues with zoning or the screening ratio.I was looking for this everywhere and now I have found it. Thanks
3,Gidget,"I loved the first movie with Sandra Dee in it, and loved watching this, but the follow up movies with different actresses, just didn't do it for me. James Darren, however made it worth while to still watch it just the once despite absence of Sandra Dee, but the different actresses gave Gidget different personallities."
1,umm hello,"Okay so I know my wife has been waiting for these movies to come out on DVD since dvd was around and what does the studio do, they release it in full screen mode only. Umm Hello , anybody else see major problems with this,to the Studios who produce it, GO BACK AND FIX ITnot worth the money, also since it appears to be only on one disc, even using double sided, it would still most likely be using a very high ( translated to bad picture ) compression schemeits a shame too because they are truely excellent movies"
1,What a letdown!,"I've been waiting for these films to be released on DVD so I could see the ENTIRE frame, not a cropped pan-and-scan portion of the frame. Why did you decide to limit the image, Columbia? It is so easy to just encode the entire original widescreen film and let the DVD viewer choose whether they want to crop it to fit their TV. Send the originals to me and I'll encode them! The more people that reject this release, the quicker we will see a proper widescreen release on the market. Unfortunately Sandra Dee, I will be waiting longer to see thee."
1,Disappointed,"I also was set to purchase these DVDs in order to view the other Gidget movies in widescreen (probably 1.85:1) as I have on tape the original Gidget movie from TCM in widescreen. However, I will NOT purchase cheesy, full-frame editions. Columbia-Tristar has really stumbled lately with their DVD releases (Ship of Fools, Divorce American Style, Trouble with Angels, etc.). When will they get with it?"
1,BOYCOTT THIS RELEASE,"Who wants a cropped pan-and-scan edition? Who wants to see LESS of the original film frame?!!! Shame on you CTS for this poor, long-awaited release. The people who want to buy this film DO NOT CARE if there are black bars on the top and bottom. We like films released on DVD in their original aspect ratio!! Why the VHS mentality?I will happily buy this set when they are released in widescreen, as they were intended to be seen."
2,I'm Holding Out for Widescreen,"I was soooooo eager to buy the Sandra Dee Gidget flicks, and willing to purchase them individually, but when I found the series -- I was tickled, UNTIL I saw it was full screen!Horrors.To the person who stated that full screen is the only way to go, I would like to say that there have been many DVDs released with BOTH options, and that's my format preference -- and my suggestion to all who are creating DVDs from older flicks -- Please forget the fancy artwork on the actual CD, and burn both sides -- one in WIDESCREEN and the other, full if you want to to appeal to both.I will wait for the widescreen edition (until then, I'll maybe rent via netflix if I feel like a gidget fix)!"
3,Pretty lame,"If you are like me and millions of other Gidget fans, you know that there was only one REAL Gidget movie and one REAL Gidget--Sandra Dee. Everything else was third rate. If you want a DVD of the original you will have to purchase this collection which contains two subsequent and dismissable spinoffs. Also disappointing is the lack of letterbox/widescreen format.The studio bungled this badly, because it, like most film critics, dismiss Gidget as a cute trifle. What they have never realized is that it is a cinematic masterpiece that brilliantly rendered an infectious American zeitgeist in vivid tones and the warm hues of summer, adolescence, and our yearning for eternal youth and freedom."
2,Gidget: No Rome!,"I was extremely frustrated after watching the first two features to find that ""Gidget Goes to Rome"" is not even on this DVD. I must have got a lemon as I appear to be the only unfortunate one here. The link is there, but there is no way to ""play"" it. I will be returning mine.Otherwise, regardless of the formats, I always enjoy all the Gidget films--particularly the ones with Sandra Dee."
1,Gidget in Cinemascope!!! Nope ... lousy 4:3,"Likewise I have a 65"" LED TV and love movies in 1.85:1 or even better in Cinemascope so am very disappointed that Gidget was not released in 2.35:1 ratio as it was originally made and screened in. I refuse to buy this pack of 4:3 crud dvds. Until companies release such films in the correct ratio I will continue to get such films from alternate sources! I suggest everyone boycott this pack until it is re-released in cinemascope (and on blu ray)."
3,where's the wide screen?!,"my boys and i bought this set for my wife for her birthday,and while the movies are as goffy fun as she and i remembered them to be i was floored when i saw that they were in fullscreen format! i should have looked closer before we bought! like i said my wife ,myself and our boys like these films but really,can't the studios put out widescreen versions of these movies,it shouldn't make it cost anymore and it would make the films much more fun to watch."
4,"If you love the Beach movies, watch this classic first","If you love the Frankie and Annette beach party movies of the 1960s , you will love GIDGET.Gidget (Girl & Midget, cuz she is short for surfing) was a great series of movies and later a one season TV for Sally Fields. Gidget is played in these three films .. originally by Sandra Dee, then Deborah Walley in Hawaiian and then Cindy Carol in the Rome film. Different actresses give this character a different spin in each new movieour heroine is in love with Moondoggy (in all three movies played by singer/actor James Darren). She tries hard to make him notice her with interesting resultsThese a wonderful follies of three family movies, no hard messaged. a similar time. Since I love watching the party beaches, this fits right in with themIf you want a harder edge surfer movie, rent either Endless Summer or Big Wednesday, I will stick with the light fare for entertainment valueBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
1,Great movie with botched packaging...,"I wanted to express my disappointment with Sony for dumping these films on the market in the FULL FRAME, pan & scan format. These films should have been made available in their respective WIDESCREEN aspect ratios (2.35 for Gidget and 1.85. for the other two). The films themselves are a lot of fun, especially the first Gidget with the great Sandra Dee, but the joy is quickly snuffed out by the fact that almost half of the picture is missing. How about a PROPER release showing these films a little respect?"
1,Spend more on a better printer,"Don't even bother trying to get support. The printer works great for about a month and then starts sending all these weird technical messages and just won't print. I was told to uninstall the software and reload it to fix problems. It worked for two days and then starting sending messages again. Spend your money on a better printer, preferably not HP."
2,This printer has caused me a great deal of stress...,"Printer frequently wastes ink, paper and time by jamming... I have a shopping bag FULL of paper here that has been wasted by this printer."
1,"No Help, even if under warrenty","My husband and I bought this printer, we thought it was a goodeconomical choice for an at home printer, we were wrong. Two daysbefore it went off warrenty it would no longer print. My yellow resetbutton flashed, and no tech support was provided with this 612c model. However if we wanted to pay 2.50 a minute they could help us. I looked up the printer on Amazon customer reports and found someone else with the same problem, a faulty ink cartridge that came with the printer. I went and bought a new one for 30.00, popped it in and bingo the printer worked again. If this happens often I'm getting rid of it. Don't get me wrong It prints great, only if you can afford it, and I rarely use mine. That's why we bought A less expensive one. If it wasn't for Amazon reports we would have been out even more money. If you do a lot of printing, this printer is not for you!"
1,no software warranty in spite of warranty promise on page 16,"On page 16 of the owners manual for the deskjet 610C series, a 90 day software warranty is listed. Hewlett Packard states that this is a misprint and HP will not honor the software warranty. Any software help is fee based. The printer developed a software problem after 60 days and would not print."
2,Nice while it lasted,"I have two problems with this printer. Number 1 is that my 612C work out and would not printer anymore after about only 6 months of use. I was well under the monthly duty for what this printer is expected to printer. The second is that the documentation that came with this product led me to believe that my printer was under warranty for an enitre year, but when I called HP to have it fixed I was told my warranty was expired, and that additional documentation was released showing only a 90 day warranty."
2,Intermitent sound after a weeks use,"I liked the idea that it didn't contain lead, but sad to say- within a week, the sound through both headphone ears became intermitent and only worked after I adjusted it and even after that, I had to make sure I didn't move and knock it out of place."
1,Defective - Doesn't work,"The product worked on one of the headphone inputs, but the other input would only work if you push your headphone plug half way in, which would cause it to cut out easily. Buy something else."
4,Couldn't put it down,"The detail and colerful descriptions of everything Boston and everything human make Dennis LeHane one of the best. Darkness Take My Hand does not disappoint in that the author makes us interested in the characters, their sometimes troubled existence and the fact that they are all human as much as any of us really are. Life is complicated and confusing for all of us at times but we share a common bond with our need for human contact, love and undrstanding. Violence can tare it all appart but the need for this love will always be there."
5,Phenomenal Read!,"A triumphant first novel! Ms. Jefferson's writing style is pulpy and poignant, with a gruesome sense of humor woven throughout her dark tale. The characters are clever and engaging, and Ms. Jefferson's predilection for Pop permeates the book. A wonderful read if you like vampires, porno, black humour, and camp. Can't wait for the next one!"
4,Very good sequel,"This writer is very intense, and also very readable. I look forward to more books in this storyline. Not for the squeamish."
2,"FIRST IT STARTS OUT HOT, THEN IT FIZZLES BADLY!","I was looking forward into reading this and the 1st 3 chapters are hot but then it starts to become lukewarm by the 5th chapter, even boring. She's a great writer but she doesn't have her ""groove"" yet. Hopefully, in future writings her books will be better."
2,Get It Secondhand,"I ended up buying this book at a used bookstore for $$$... dollars. That's all I would recommend paying for this. This is just another first-person tale that falls short of the two genres that it aims for. First, it aims for the ""ancient vampire's lament"" style with the character of Ricari, who isn't developed nearly enough. Secondly, it falls short of the Poppy Z. Brite ""vampires-as-trendy-young-cyberpunk-hipsters"" style with the characters Daniel and Lovely. It has a distinctly ""Mary Sue""-ish quality to it. For a book that combines both genres and yet hits the mark, I'd reccommend ""The Time of Feasting"" by Mick Farren. And of course, if you like vampire fiction, you can't go wrong with ""Lost Souls"" by Poppy Z. Brite."
2,Vampire Tale Lacking Plot and Characterisation,"'Voice of the Blood' is initially interesting for the scenarios it creates and the use of a female main character as a vampire. I bought this book thinking it would be a real page-turner on a cold, wet winter's day. It was a page-turner but mainly in the sense that I kept reading it hoping for the plot to develop more and characterisations to extend beyond two-dimensional profiles. I was disappointed in that the characters could have been developed further and their individual histories given more substance. I found myself not really liking the main character. If you are into horror that is more sex and romance, then perhaps this book is for you."
4,Better Than I Expected,"I've met Jemiah before (friend of a friend of a friend), so I was curious about her book. I'm not sure what I expected to read. I think I was expecting a tedious, Anne Rice style novel, but it wasn't like that at all. The writing was descriptive and interesting without being tedious, which is what I think Anne Rice is guilty of throughout The Vampire Chronicles. The book kept moving and pulled me along with it. The characters were well thought out and I felt like I knew them. It is obvious that Jemiah knows the gothic subculture. She described it perfectly and made the appropriate musical references (no Marilyn Manson, thank God!). With the exception of the Prologue and Epilogue, I enjoyed this book. I found the tone of the writing in the Prologue and Epilogue to be somewhat stiff. It didn't seem to fit with the flowing tone of the rest of the book."
2,Very disappointing,"Unfortunately I have a dissenting opinion. I did not find the characters at all interesting. I thought they were whiney, immature, and one dimensional. I have read a lot of the best in this genre, Laurell K. Hamilton, Tanya Huff, etc., and was VERY disappointed in this book. I do think this author has talent, but wish she had spent more time on characterization."
5,"Erotic, Gothic, Bloody","This is quite a debut effort from a new writer who's bound to make herself known within horror circles. She writes like a real pro, her knowledge of gothic lifestyle quite certain. The vampires here are very real, the first-person protag easily identifiable. I recommend this book highly, as I was quite pleased and surprised with its contents. Great job, Ms Jefferson. I'll look for more from you."
3,A strong sense of locale with an ordinary plot,"Nell Bray, an Oxford student in 1900 has decided to spend a summer holiday with her friends at a classmate's uncle's house in the Lake District. Unfortunately, they discover that the uncle may have inadvertently murdered someone and he is being harassed. When a horse rides onto the farm through an early morning mist with a dead body on it's back, things turn especially ugly.Gillian Linscott succeeds in bringing the Lake District of a century ago very much alive. The well drawn characters make full use of the landscape as Nell tries to get to the bottom of the murders. However, the story lacks true interest or progression. In a sense, it resonates with the heritage of the countryhouse mystery but without the sense of fun. Overall, a very ordinary effort."
2,Don't waste your time,"Carmella's been one of my favorites for years, so it comes as no surprise that I decided to purchase her playmate DVD. As surprising as it is, the whole thing is quite boring and cheesy... despite her being NAKED! The Playboy home videos from the early 90's are even considerably better than this. Save your money. Everyone should expect more from Playboy."
4,soundtrack to your worst nightmares,What really separates this group from the rest of the death and black metal bands out there is their ominous and haunting keyboard tones. They add just the right amount of contrast to the ferocious vocals and monster riffs. I'll forgive the utterly cliché album title. This disc is the soundtrack to your worst nightmares
3,Many parts missing in shipment. Doesn't mulch well.,"I must say, I've never had as many missing parts in a shipped item as this one. Missing upon arrival were the owner's manual, two knobs for the height adjustment levers, two bolts and nuts, a cotter pin and a hub cap! C'mon Amazon, you can do better than that! Now I have to call the manufacturer and get these parts on my own.The mower itself started without problems and seems to run smoothly. It does not, however mulch very well. We'll see how it goes with some different height adjustments on it's ""maiden voyage"" tommorrow.Update...I've had this mower for 6 years now. Continues to run reliably."
5,good stuff,very useful for pre soaking fabric it's a must it helps not cotton to hold color a lot better
3,or 2 stars-crawling underground to surface baby dragons?,"from what i can remember in 80's college dorm ""cable""-(i think it was on ""showtime"")-kinda almost lousy movie only action is at end. needs more action, monsta action and monster time or monster closeup time and explanation, its slightly better than ""humongous""."
3,Alright untill they blow it..,"... by showing the monster. I could have built a better one in my garage from a outdoor fire pit, a hose and a hard rake.This deserves a three but three would have been my max rating anyway as it contains no subtitles or even closed captions. This makes it very difficult for people with any hearing difficulties to follow the dialog.It also has Boom Mike in screen disease."
1,Please wake me when it's over........,"Ive waited for this movie since my sister told me she saw it back in 82 at the theatre. I never believed her that there was a movie called THE BOOGENS because it was never released until now....but after I watched it,I wished she never told me about the movie because it would have saved me an hour and a half when I could have watched a better movie like darkness LOL! Id give it a 0 star but it wont let me."
3,Fun creature movie.,"Not the greatest movie ever, but I had a really fun time with this one. Love the older horror movies with practical effects no matter how good or badly they are done. If you love 80's horror movie then I think you will love this movie."
4,Good Movie!,"This is a really good movie! The acting was good and believe it or not the plot was original. Now don't get me wrong the special effects have come a long way since this movie so don't expect great special effects. If you are interested in movies that keep you on the edge of your seat and make you jump then this movie is for you. Another good thing is the audio was good and clear. Plus the extras are fairly good. Just make sure when you reopen a mine there are no Boogens inside of it, because it will get deadly."
4,"A good, old fashioned B monster movie.","The Boogens, a simple and unpretentious monster movie, was a big breath of fresh air when it first appeared back in the slasher soaked early eighties. A group of likeable college students help two crusty old miners open up an abandoned mine. Too bad they don't know it was abandoned for good reason, the mines are infested with tentacled turtle like monsters that quickly escape and wreak havoc. I appreciate movies that at least try to build characters that can be cared about, as well as rely on our fear of them coming to harm to build real suspense as opposed to simply tossing buckets of grue around for a cheap thrill. The cast is quite good (young talent, Rebecca Balding where are you?! I was in LOVE, mixed with the usual sprinkling of seasoned character actors), as is the monster design. The Boogens is by no means a classic, but it remains an endearing enough success to be worth an occasional revisit by the monster movie enthusiast. Recommended."
5,So glad to see this get a DVD release,"I saw this film back in the 80s, when it would occasionally appear on Cinemax. Then, the film seemed to vanish off the face of the earth. Thanks to Olive films, The Boogens is finally out on DVD and the wait was worth it.Sure, the film moves a bit slow (compared to most horror films now) and the monsters are INCREDIBLY CHEESY. But the slow build allows for more character development than most horror films at the time and the critters aren't reveled until the film is almost over, giving you time to be scared of the glimpses you do get. Yea, you'll laugh when you see the full monsters, but The Boogens is still a pretty scary, fun little horror film.The DVD presentation isn't pristine, but it's pretty good. And the commentary track is a lot of fun. If you love 80s horror films, but are looking for something other than slasher flicks and have seen all the classics of the era, check this one out."
4,The Boogens BD AWSOME!!!!,"Finally on blu-ray and dvd. I would have given this five stars, but the picture quality is a little grainy and the only special feature is commentary(which is still pretty cool and interesting). This movie used to scare the hell out of me when i was a kid and still is one of only a hand full of movies that still give me the creeps now as an adult. I would recommend this movie highly for horror buffs who haven't seen it."
2,I'm going to be the odd-man out...,"... but I was severely underwhelmed by ""The Boogens.""This is a very pedestrian effort. Step-by-step, i was ahead of where the movie was going and invariably dissapointed when it got there. The monsters are unimpressive, the actors are nothing to cheer about, and the script is weak in all respects, except one: the lead characters are not as dumb as the average players in the most typical tales of this type. It's not a bad film, per se, but it's most remarkable feature is its total mediocrity.If you want a good monster movie of this vein, I recommend the classic ""Island of Terror."" If you want something a little more contemporary, go with ""Tremors."" The former is closer in tone and nature to ""The Boogens"" than the latter, but both will sate your need for creepy critters and thrills more effectively than ""The Boogens."""
3,One creepy little movie.,"Stepping from the memories of horror fans of years past comes The Boogens, a very effective monster tale. Old, forgotten evil and shunned places have informed some of the best horror ever since H. P. Lovecraft first set foot in haunted Arkham. Therefore, The Boogens, with its errie mine shafts and mysterious creatures has a lot going for it. Thankfully, the director doesn't saddle the film with dumb-as-dirt characters and goofy cliches. We actually come to care for these people(a titanic achievement for many of today's filmmakers). A great emphasis is placed on generating suspense in lieu of tiresome ""pop-ups."" A product of budgetary concerns, this nonetheless works in the film's favor. If the titular monsters are less than life-like, at least the smart editing obscures this. Fans of older horror films will no doubt enjoy this movie, as will younger fans looking for a little heart and creativity in their horror."
5,This Movie Should be a DVD,A really fine creature feature. The cast is good. The script has humor. The monster looks like E.T. with teeth. I seem to recall that the movie was marketed poorly. Too bad. It was really good junk.
5,Finally finally finally!!!,"This little gem slipped in and out of the Drive In circuit in the midst of the early eighties slasher craze and barely made a blip on the radar. I was fortunate enough to have seen it on a double bill with another movie of which I have forgotten. A very effective monster flick which scared me to death as a 13 year old. I have owned this on VHS for many years and am so happy to know that I will be able to see it again without drags, pops, and audio problems. This title may come and go quickly so if you want your copy, don't hesitate."
3,boogens,"the boogens is a cheap , poorly acted horror movie. the monsters looked like turtles with tentacles i would not recommend"
2,Only for hardcore fans DFA and LCD Sounsystem,"Super overindulgent, repetitive, boring mixes.He kills Le Tigre's ""Deceptacon"" as the opening track and it's all downhill or round and round and round in nowhere land for the rest. Seriously, a 12:13 mix of Gorillaz' ""Dare?"" These tracks are too long for dance tracks unless you're a seriously crispy raver. I think they have hit the boundary of white boy dance music and gone beyond. Not worth the money no how no way. Buy a track before you buy the cd. All the tracks are trademark LCD Soundsystem beats driven monotonously into the ground"
2,Saint John's Bible:Psalms,"I already owned Saint John's Pentateuch and Gospels and Acts. Thinking of all the art possibilities for the Psalms, I was very disappointed with the Saint John's Bible:Psalms. I think the author missed a golden opportunity to make the Psalms shine. In a Christian thrift store I came across a small book called The Book of Psalms in the Authorized Version. There are lovely illustrations on practically every page. I believe it is being offered as a used book through Amazon at a very reasonable price. I won't buy another Saint John's Bible book without seeing it first. Jean Rhoads, Bloomington IN"
4,St. John's Bible: Psalms,I read the earlier reviews that this edition lacked the beautiful pictures that other editions contained. While I agree there are less drawings. the beauty resides in the words. I do appreciate the wonderful drawings of the other editions but I enjoy the meaning found in the messages of the Psalms. One picture may be worth a thousand words but it would thousands of pictures to do these words justice.
3,Disappointed,"Compared to the other two Donald Jackson Bible books I bought, the Psalm book is a disappointment. I looked forward to seeing Mr. Jackson's illustrations of the Psalms, but was let down when I saw he had done very little. As far as I am concerned, Mr. J. missed an opportunity to make the Psalms glow. Jean Rhoads, Bloomington, Indiana"
1,Terrible movie it really really sucks....:-(,This movie sucks it was terrible please don't rent this movie cause it wasn't a good movie at all it is a waste of time renting this movie I gave it 1 star it does not deserve even a one star I was mad when I started looking at this movie on my kindle fire the actors were terrible I don't know why people waste there time making movies like this thinking it is going to be a hit when it is not going to make it to the top....:-(
1,Ummmmm...ok.,"Where to begin with this travesty on video?The ""acting"", if you could call it that, was so apallingly bad that I thought at first this must be some kind of spoof or something. Words simply fail me in describing how poorly every single person tried to play out their part in this awful movie. Thankfully, most of the characters die by then end of the film. I know, spoiler. You'll thank me later for saving you the time to watch this, ahem, ""movie"".The ""scary"" bits in the film were just as poorly done and left me with nothing but even more contempt for this video abomination. I found myself wanting to skip ahead just to see if anything got any better. It doesn't.Run! Run as fast you can! Get as far away from this film as you possibly can before it wastes one minute of your life that you will never get back!"
2,not great acting,"Was entertaining enough to watch the entire thing, but would not watch again.Predictable plotPretty bad actingwould not recommend to friends or family"
3,"Eh, it was alright","The acting wasn't the worst I've seen, but was ok enough to make the movie tolerable. Little too much ""Blair-Witch-ish"" though in my opinion."
1,Awful - Editors removed key parts of The NIght Before Christmas Poem!,"If I could give Zero stars this book would get it! This book almost ruined our Christmas Eve! Senior editor Alastair Dougall of Doring Kindersley removed key parts of the classic tale The Night Before Christmas, for which the book takes it name!The stanzas beginning with ""The children were nestled all snug in their beds,"" ""When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter"" are completely GONE!The editors must have needed to shorten the classic poem to make room for other stories of Christmas which are indeed beautiful but they don't make up for the missing parts of the classic poem. Perhaps the removed verses are part of some original version but there is no indication of this in the book.Once I realized the hack job that these editors had done, I was lucky to be able to locate our old copy of Moore's poem from last year which I could read aloud to my 6-year-olds."
2,Hitler beyond the myth,"The author have tried to describe Hitler in daily terms,whith the dialogs which we never imagine that he had. But if this described flesh and blood one is worthy for us is a question. The ideas and the efforts of the will by which he tried to shape a new world are what make him meaningful in our mind and in history.."
5,"desmond morris, animal behavior, excellent combination","once again desmond morris takes a series of questions this time about dogs, and answers them in a complete and fascinating wayextrememly informative, easy to read, and good for any animal loveri also reccomend his books on cats and horses"
4,This will go everywhere,"My friends had several choice travel books on Spain, but the Lonely Planet guide was the most descript. We constantly used its restaurant guide (instead of those commercial-plugged ones)and found GREAT places totally known by the locals only(and other Lonely Planet readers). This book is cool and it really tells like it is without talking down to the reader."
1,Mislead,I thought from the description of the item I was purchasing perfume and I received eau de toilette. The description of the product was misleading.
4,Best way to have Nando's no matter where you are in the world,"We were very pleased with Nando's sauce. Simple to use and tastes just like you are at Nando's. Wish it was a bigger bottle, but we'll take it!"
3,"good buy, but doesnt stay sharp","I like this knife, but it only stayed sharp for maybe a few weeks of constant use and then had to be sharpened. other then that, nice and heavy, sleek look, great grip, but you will need to invest in a knife sharpener."
5,A great comfort for a bereaved parent,"Kay, as an author, and as a speaker, gets the point of continuing life after death across with much enthusiasm! I recently met Kay and her book, and wish I had this book when my daughter was killed. A book on grief and life after death by a bereaved mother and author is very helpful!!"
1,Do Not Buy Metal Pastry Brushes!,"It is not a good idea to buy pastry brushes that have metal on them. After only a few week of using a brush that looks identical to this one, the metal part of the brush started rusting very badly; it looks so bad not I'm afraid to use it. Now my $5 investment for a junky metal brush is wasted and I must spend $10 or more for a quality pastry brush, which I should have done in the first place. Heed my warning. Even if you leave this brush in your sink (in water) or not it will rust. You almost have to immediately clean a brush like this, which is difficult when dinner's ready and you're hunry. Get the idea? Good luck with your search on a different brush."
5,Go look at ISBN 0071354565,"Go look at ISBN 0071354565. Same book, newer edition. Weather Reports, Forecasts & Flight Planning by Terry T. Lankford"
3,MOOG POWER OUTAGE,"VERY MIDDLE OF THE ROAD COMMERCIAL POP MUSIC OF THE TIME PLAYED ON THE MOOG BY HUGO MONTENEGRO WITH A LOT OF VOCAL ACCOMPANIMENT AND BIG ARRANGEMENTS. NOT ENOUGH OF THE MOOG. I WAS DISAPPOINTED, SINCE SOME OF HIS ALBUMS FROM THE 60'S ARE GREAT (CHECK OUT ""COME SPY WITH ME"", THAT ONE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES)."
3,Good Songs / Bad Sound,"This disc had a lot of potential, but the songs sound like they're been played through a tin can! Al Jarreau has the vocal range to really pay tribute to Bill Withers like this, but the technology behind the recording and reproduction just fell flat. Having seen Al Jarreau in concert, I know this could have been much better!"
4,"Very bohemian, actually","It's cool. In a kinda dramatic-not-really way. The intro is fantastic, building up in a way you could almost imagine on an Austin Powers soundtrack. Woo-hoo's punctuate the chorus, and there is perhaps an overlay of irony on the whole, but it doesn't really matter if you just take this song as modern day retro sounds for the too cool crowd. However, since that crowd would be too bohemian to actually listen to music with lyrics, everybody else in the world can enjoy this, joining in with that great mainstay of music: all together now, ""Woah-ho, Woo!"""
3,I was disappointed,"This should have been marketed more as a UFO book as the first 108 pages are devoted to them. And there are only 169 pages in the entire book. Although the chapter entitled 'Atlantis in Illinois?' is interesting, all of the other chapters seem like they were written just to fill out the book. I expected more than UFO stories."
4,My account of the study of the W Files,"I believe I am reviewing the wrong book here... I have just finished the W-files... of Wisconsin... which was good reading. So I will quit this page and review... I find Unexplained Mysteries always entertaining if not factual..and food for thought. Jay Rath does a very good job of reporting the facts he has upturned. Truly a remarkable, time consuming effort in order to put them all down on paper.. I believe anyone with an open mind should read his books... I shall now click backwards to the correct page ... the W-Files."
1,don't buy,This game is terrible! It is almost impossible to play defense on this game. Very difficult to tackle and impossible to cover the wide outs. If your going to buy a game buy NFL2K.
3,Save your money ! get nfl 2k1!,"Although this game has improved over last years version it still does not measure up to nfl 2k or even the playstations versions of madden and gameday 2001. Wide open receivers drop easy catches the computer defensive line often cheats and you can still gain big yards with any quaterback running the bootleg. I was playing the super bowl and had a big lead and all of a sudden late in the game the computer started controlling the action and i just managed to hang on to win( plays repeating that i didn't call- ext). Okay for a rental but, if you must have a game get one of the other titles that are coming out, and leave this one in the store."
1,Worst Game EVER,"This is beyond any shadow of a doubt the worst game that has ever been made. I would rather play Pong than this game. The controls are totally inaccurate, and the game is beyond slow. If you want to play a good football game, look elsewhere because this disk is best used as a frisbee."
3,Deeply flawed but valuable and vivid,"This short novel (novella) well illustrates Oz's strengths (no pun, but maybe there is) and foibles as a writer of extended fiction. The portraits are vivid, as are the individual scenes. But as a whole this novel fails because it fails in the basic element of fiction--plot. Rather, it is successful in and useful for its encapsulations of prejudices at war with the kinder aspects of our common humanity. Valuable for its portraits, warts and all, of a strategic constituency. The thesis of the novel is not proven, but the depictions are vivid. And the setting, of eminent importance."
4,One of many views and emotions about growing up in Israel,"I found this to be a great book because it gave me a different view point, and range of feelings and emotions about living in that time period. This book opened my mind (as all books should do) by exposing me to situations and feelings that away from my world."
2,Disappointed,"After all the hype, I was sadly disappointed by this book--I found Mr. Oz's writing style to be irritating and self-involved, full of unnecessary tangents (""Five minutes ago, as I was writing about closing the window and shutters, I stopped writing because I remembered to get up and close the bathroom door..."") Toward the end I found myself skipping over several pages listing the inventory of his father's library! Another irritation: it seemed quite plausible that the boy would dream of sending a rocket to London; but to self-destruct as a suicide bomber? That is a dream of a very different boy at a very different time, and Oz knows it."
3,"it comes from darkness, wanders around, and returns to darkness","Panther in the Basement tackles the same set of narrative concerns which Oz handles with greater prowess in other works, notably The Hill of Evil Council and portions of his memoir, A Tale of Love and Darkness. Oz uses a literary technique in Panter which can be quite effective when applied evenly: the young narrator's games mirror that of the adult world, exposing the fear, hypocrisy, and outright fraud of grown up society. But somehow Oz misses his target here. Although all the elements are in place, there is the feeling that he is not in stride in this work. Although a worth while read, especially for someone who wants to explore the range of Oz's styles and themes, this work does not represent Amoz Oz at his very best."
4,Disappointing cover,The Amazon image shows the back cover. I'm one of those who believes a spiritual writer should have proper humility and not splash his/her picture all over the cover. The front cover is entirely Fr. Allender's face!
3,Nails the theory and concepts but fails on the examples.,"The examples are somewhat jumbled. There's never a full view of the program and he often uses variables or methods before he defines them. It's like he creates it, then explains it in reverse."
5,Absorbing story of one man's coming of age in a time of war,"This chronicle is a rich tapestry of war time action woven against a background of a boy's transformation into manhood through duty, love, and acceptance of personal limitations. Norman Berg brings his combat missions alive with gripping vividness of detail. But it is the comparatively economical passges on his subjective experiences that give this book its poignancy. Staying the course in war and sixty years of reflection have added the tincture of a profound sense of fate to this writer's ink. It makes this memoir shine."
3,Bonsai for the beginner,"Overly rated by others. The film is too simple and plain. It will bore any bonsai beginner to dead. I would recommend the ""Growing Art of Bonsai Video"" or the ""Thriving Bonsai"" DVD instead. I watched them all and found this one provided the least information."
3,Good Overview,"This book covers the better bunch of Germans that held high positions in the German military during World War 2 outside of the death camps and groups. The book provides an adequate description of each of the people with a view to making their activities as notorious as possible. I would have liked a little more lively writing style. It seamed to me that the book was wooden. I wanted more punch. We are talking here of the greatest, most wide ranging war that has ever been fought, give me a little drama. I was not looking for a graduate level test book and that is what I think I received. Overall, it is another review of some of the major players of WW 2 German military, if you have not read a book on this topic then this will provide you that back ground."
4,Flip Open Spine Lug,"I really Like this Knife allot because it will stay in your hand and not slip out. A Great Fiber Handle.I have already purchased 3 of these knives and none of them fail to Lock Open. If you get one of these that Fails to Lock Open then just Put is through it's paces by whipping it open a few dozen times. This will help to Break In the Lock Open Position so that it will Repeat Lock Up.Also I used a Dremel Cut Off Wheel and Cut Off the Flip Open Lug on the ""Spine"" that you don't want to Bump Open in your Pocket. It is Much Safer now and there is still a Side Flip Open Lug to get it open Fast."
2,C230komp,Good and sharp. Use gloves if you use this knife. Damn lock will fail and fold to get your fingers.
2,"Bad CD changer, Great Sound!","It is all good except for a few things: the fm receptor is in the back of the stereo sytem and must be pulled out all the way to receive it the clearest, the cd changer is extremely slow and makes alot of noise, also when theres no cds in there it searches through each dics holder, it takes alot of time and wastes alot of power. Other than that the sound is great, the look is nice, theres a nice and simple remote, and contains all the features of a stereo system!"
3,"Slow Disc Changer, But Good Sound","Bought this for my boyfriend last Christmas. It has lots of lights that blink constantly (even when it is turned off). If they are too annoying, the only alternative is to unplug the unit. Also, you can only load one disc at a time, the unit is very slow and makes a loud whiny sound when the disc changer is rotating or shuffling discs. But, the sound quality is great and the sound quality can be changed to options like ""Live"" or ""Concert Hall"" or ""Disco."" Seems like Panasonic should've taken out some of the lights in the unit and put them in the remote control."
1,Horrible reel,"Tried replacing the good old Zebco 33 with this thing. Looked and felt great till first cast. Something is really wrong with the brake release timing. If you throw it like a child it will function. If not, you may get a hook in the face. Bad ju ju on this one. Heading back to the 33."
5,Works Great,These can be arranged to dampen the heads but not muffle the sound. Highly recommend for all styles of playing.
4,Cindy,Product was good and simple to use. The only problem was that my package was ripped open. I checked to see if anything was missing but it was all there.
3,Somewhat good,"I got these as a gift, and they do muffle drums, but can pick up dust and dirt quickly, they do not stick as in gloopy but attack and do not slip on a drum surface. They do muffle the echo which is good, but I believe there is better than this.Overall they do their job, butt they are not a life saver."
5,Great Product,"By far the best product to dampen your drums. No more tape. It does what its supposed to do and its so easy to maintain, yeah it might leave your head a little bit blue, but u can always wash your head with simple h2o. Unlike the damper rings, the moongel allows you to further dampen your drum to your own specific level of tone. From one musician to another, I would definitly recommend using this product. But dont just take my word or anyone elses word for it, try it out for yourself, thats what I did and was not dissapointed."
3,ok but,"its fine, really, but duct tape and napkins or tissues do just as good as job - maybe this looks better but that's usually not a majkor concern"
4,good product,"I WAS HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT. EASY TO USE AND EFFECTIVE. AS A DRUMMER, I CAN CHANGE POSITIONS OF THE PADS BETWEEN SONGS TO ACHIEVE DESIRED SOUND. THEY DO NOT STAIN OR LEAVE RESIDUE ON YOUR SKINS."
3,"They do muffle, but not very much.","I bought this product about a week and went through a couple test runs. They do muffle the sound; however, not very much and you can still her extra sound you don't want. I don't recommend these honestly; however, if you need something that kind of muffles the sound and is cheap, then this might be for you."
1,Nah,Really? Try using a piece of duct/gaff tape. it's more practical in every way. I laughed at my buddy for having these in his studio.. maybe suck on some gummy bears and toss em on your drumheads instead? ..then you get to eat the left overs :)
2,Saccharine,"Unlike some of the other Little People DVDs (e.g., the ""Friendship Collection""), this video is contrived and painful to watch. Even our toddler can tell that it's trying too hard to be educational."
4,What I Tell You Three Times Is The TRUTH!!!,"This book is great. This book is great. This book is great. The only problem with it is the same problem with just about any great cyberpunk novel, the ending is weak and unimaginative. I read it three months ago and I don't remember how the bloody thing ends. Ian McDonald has done an outstanding job with this novella though. I highly recommend it to anyone, even if you don't like sci-fi."
5,Beautiful.,"I'm a big Ian McDonald fan, and this is my favorite Ian McDonald book -- even if it is just a novella."
4,Good instructions for beginners,"This is a good video for beginner guitarists. It also has some (what the title describes) ""intermediate"" techniques such as sweep picking, legato, tapping, and pinch harmonics. However, the actual instruction for these techniques is limited and you really have to watch Mark play every part several times before really understanding what he briefly explains. Other than that it definitely helped me learn a few new tricks. I like this video."
3,Godzilla- King Ghidorah,My son loves the toy. It arrived just as described. I was sent numerous emails letting me know the product was on its way.
4,Godzilla 3 headed dragon figure,Good Godzilla item. Very cool looking. Son loves the Godzilla toys. Gives lots of entertainment to play these toy figures against each other.
2,"Great music, but sadly not great sound quality!","The GBO were one of the great British R&B bands, being and off-shoot from Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated. Enjoyable music throughout is sadly marred by indifferent rather 'flat' sound quality. Whatever the packaging says, I am told the set was actually dubbed from disc rather than taken from the master tapes; that would explain the odd 'tick' here and there."
4,Fine British R&B,"This is great stuff, rather jazzier than most British R&B of the time, and with an unusual sound since there is no guitarist on hand. Bond and Dick Heckstall-Smith make one hell of a front line, and of course the rhythm section of Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker can't be faulted (Baker, in fact, plays with much more restraint than he did later with Cream). In a way it's surprising that Bond doesn't make more use of Jack's fine singing voice, but Bond is a good singer in a rather style openly imitative of Ray Charles (who is pretty obviously the main influence on this music). Graham Bond was a fine talent who unfortunately never found much commercial success and died too young. Fans of the British R&B scene of the '60s should not pass this disc by."
1,Encourages gender stereotypes and premature sexuality,"From <a href=""http://www.truceteachers.org/"">Teachers Resisting Unhealthy Children's Entertainment</a>: This toy features dolls ""outfitted in spiked heels, heavy make-up, and very skimpy, tightly-fitting clothes.""Toys like this ""dictate that certain toys and interests are only for boys or only for girls, emphasize highly sexualized appearance/behavior that is confusing to children, and make bodies the focus of play and equate self-worth with appearance (often extreme thinness)."""
1,No Originality!,"I bought this CD because of the great reviews and because I really like the song ""Heaven"" which I heard on the radio. I also own several Stevie Ray Vaughan CDs. This Los Lonely Boys CD starts with Stevie Ray Vaughan songs and about 1/2 the CD is Stevie Ray Vaughan with different lyrics. I love Stevie and saw him in concert just before he died. If I wanted to listen to Steve I wouldn't have bought Los Lonely Boys. They have no originality."
5,Pure Raw Energy!,"This cd recorded live in a small club setting displays the Raw energy of Henry Garza's guitar playing. I've listened to this over and over, pulling it out again when I need a boost. The covers do SRV justice and their original songs are smooth and pure. Their rock n roll /latin roots in a blues blend brings out a vunerability that takes us deeper into the magic of what guitar playing does to your soul. These boys can sing, all three of them, with passion. Their orchestrated bass work, lead guitar, drumbeats and powerful vocals show that they've been playing wholeheartedly, pouring themselves into these instruments like a sacred agreement was made when they first picked them up. .In this era of overproduced tech tracks being sold everywhere. Los Lonely Boys Blue Cat Blues is a refreshing dip into their unique version of what they call ""texican rock and roll""."
3,Never Got the Interactive Website feature to work,"My daughter has fully enjoyed using the mp3 player feature of this toy with no problems. However, despite hours of trying and calls into the customer service department and checking with an IT expert, we have NEVER been able to get the interactive feature with the barbie girls website to work. My daughter has been very disappointed because that is why she put this mp3 player on her birthday list. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Mattel customer service could only tell us we did not have enough memory to runt he program, but our computer has a TON of extra memory so I know that is not correct."
3,mixed review I bought four of these,"I bought three all three gifts for birthdays two worked and they were great the last one did not so I ordered another one and it worked fine didn't want to deal with trying to return it new to buying online so I used the extra peices in case anything else has issues ,overall it was great and I would buy it again for another person but the online play we just don't use hope this helps someone to make a decision"
4,Glad I bought it,I originally didn't like this product. After reading more I was able to download tunes for my granddaughter by downloading them on the computer first and then transferring them to her toy. She loves it! I bought the headphones instead of the small ear pieces since she is 4 and she loves it.
2,confused,I don't know if maybe we are doing something wrong BUT I cannot seem to get online for my six year old granddaughter. we worked on this for hours. Seems like every screen name we picked was already taken then we got to the part to choose a character and it just would not work. Maybe I don't know what to do but we followed the directions. She went to bed and never even got to play with it yet.
4,great first mp3 player for girl,"I will make this quick, my daughter loves this toy. Not only does she love playing the online games but she loves (with my help) downloading songs. Follow the directions, very easy to do from either a music cd or existing music files on your computer. Some one had posted what site to download from. If you have windows media player, very easy from there. I suggest getting it. This Christmas toy was well worth the money. I would also like to know how to delete unwanted songs, did not see anything in the directions covering that. We have only had it about a week, so I am hoping I can figure that out next. Overall all, great toy."
4,well made barbie doll toy,"Bought this for 7-yr old niece. She LOVED her new mp3 player. Sound qualify was pretty good, and the toy is well made. Fashion pack ""snap-on"" cloths were durable and very stylish. Read a lot about the problem w/ the online entertainment portion of this toy. Haven't had the chance to test that out & thus can't comment on it. However, just the mp3 portion seems to be fun enough for young girls. It retains the barbie cloth changing concept they like and now added the mp3 player."
