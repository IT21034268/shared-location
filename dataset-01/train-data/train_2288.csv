2,"Not worth the price, less expensive dough blender works better",I paid a lot of money for this item because it had been given a great review by some magazine I read. The handle is very comfortable and it is very well made. But the bottom side edges are not rounded. They handle comes up at a 90 degree angle from the bottom. So it is very difficult to actually blend the pastry dough in a rounded bowl. My $3.00 Ekco pastry blender does a much better job of blending the pastry. I think any dough blender with a curved surface at the bottom would perform better than this item.
3,Just so so,I still prefer my wire blender to this one. It was much less expensive and lighter in weight. This pastry blender was just to heavy and awkward to be my favorite.
2,Best design on market but.... Mine broke.,"I've had mine for over a year and use it about once a month to blend butter into shortbread or other dough recipes. I love the product. Though mine looks like new, I noticed last night that one of the blades on the outside had a bad weld and has come loose. Looking for the warranty information... If I can get it replaced by them, would still rate highly, but all I have now is a kitchen tool that broke after less than 20 applications."
1,The worst shaver ever!,"This is the worst shaver I have ever had!I moved to the US but left my own shavers in my homeland, so I decided to buy one here. After looking for a good one, I decided to buy this one. But right after 2 months, it was disassembled!!!The interesting part is that I just used it once a week!I know it's not possible to give less that 1 star to the products. otherwise I would give NO STAR to this one!Just waste of money...!I ordered another one with totally different brand and now a bit satisfied."
1,too cheaply made for me,i felt uncomfortable using this product. flimsy cheap. i am sorry but i don't care for it. it has a very sharp razor blade in it.
1,Very disappointed,"Did not get ""ale pail"" from picture, which was the only reason I ordered it. Mine has a learn to brew advertisement on it. Shipping was almost the cost of bucket. Very disappointed."
5,great shelf!,"I love this shelf--the price was great, it shipped quickly, arrived well-packaged, and was not too difficult to put together. I assembled it myself (I am a 54 year-old woman with no construction skills!), and really like the way it looks in my living room."
5,winsome bookcase,I love it and the quality was better than I'd expected.Will certainly buy another of their products without hesitation!
5,Folding Shelf,"I love this shelving; easy to assemble, easy to use, stable and a nice addition to any mobile household. I like it a lot."
3,Mediocre craftsmanship,"I actually ordered 3 of these particular bookcases. They are difficult to put together because the screws are much too big for the pre-drilled holes. One of the tops came cracked. One of the bookshelves came with no hardware. In order to have my bookshelf ready to use in a timely manner, I had to take pieces to the hardware store and buy the hardware. These bookshelves are much too expensive for such poor quality."
1,Poorly constructed,"I purchased the Winsome Wood Foldable book shelf. I tried to put it together but the allen wrench they enclosed stripped the screws and I could never tighten them enough. The screw and peg holes were too small, and all the screws and other hardware were cheap. It took be two hours to put together, and was so wobbly that I took it apart and mailed it back as a return. Most foldable bookshelves come already constructed, so I ordered one from another company and it was great, just unfold and start stacking books on it. Avoid this one, it is not worth the time or money."
1,Impossible to assemble!,If you are a single person DO NOT purchase this product! It is IMPOSSIBLE to assemble by yourself! You need AT LEAST 2 extra strong people just to hold the frame!
3,"Shelf ok, but better have your own allen wrenches","Well, the shelf is actually just what I needed to fit against the wall where there is a bulky, protruding power outlet in my office. But when I assembled it, I managed to screw in 2.5 of lots more than that screws before the pot metal--soft, cheap--of which the allen wrench was made got the edges of the hexagon entirely stripped off. Fortunately, the screws held up better so once I got home and remembered to bring my own set of multiple-sized allen wrenches in to the office, I was able to assemble it in good order. Knowing this in advance would have made the assembly job a one hour affair instead of a 4 day affair with pieces strewn about my office while I went home every day and didn't quite remember to bring my wrenches in to work. Here's hoping to save you the trouble by letting you know in advance."
5,Excellent bookshelves; excellent price,"This bookcase has 3 well spaced inside top shelves plus top. Solid wood, no particle board. I was able to assemble it without assistance (50+ female). I may add a coat of polyurethane, but otherwise, an excellent product!"
4,Attractive and useful piece of furniture,"When assembled, the item looks very nice. Assembly took quite a bit of time, and would be difficult for a person who isn't handly with tools."
3,Sturdy and good looking...,"...but much more difficult to assemble than it needed to be. About half the holes were drilled in the wrong place, requiring re-drilling, and some of the edges needed sanding. Once correctly assembled, however, it is exactly as advertised. A good buy for the price, but expect to spend about an hour and use more tools than advertised when putting it together."
5,Solid and Useful,"I've built my share of you-build-it furniture over the years, and this is one of the better pieces. The wood is thick and strong, and the design solid. I've been using three of these to have shelves in my hallway for the past 8 months. They've been ideal, not looking cheap at all.The instructions were straightforward and simple, and while a second person will help make things easier, it's just because the wood used is heavy and solid. I would definitely buy more of these if I needed more shelving."
3,Hard to assemble,"Overall the quality of the product is good - wood is solid. However, putting it together is very challenging and once together not super sturdy. It was good enough that I'm not sending it back (using for toys). The problem is the screws are almost impossible to screw in because they are on the ground while you're trying to do it leaving no room to turn them. Plus the folding sides keep falling which adds to the frustration. Had to trim one dowel because the pre-cut hole was not deep enough and one screw went out of the wood which left it unusable and unable to tighten. The savior was that once you lock in the fold down shelves they keep it sturdy enough where it doesn't sway. Disappointed cause I really liked the size, style and wood and would like to have ordered a couple more."
2,Difficult Assembly because of Manufacturer Error,"I normally do not write reviews - however, after assembling this book shelf I thought I would caution potential buyers of some of the problems I encountered. It should be very easy to assemble - but the holes predrilled were not large enough. They enclose a hex head wrench which is small and really can bruise your hand when trying to get the screws into the predrilled holes. I finally got out my drill and enlarged the holes to make it somewhat easier to assemble - even then you need to use caution as to not make them too big. It is a nice piece of furniture - but assembly is difficult only in that it is not drilled properly!"
2,"Frustrating Assembly, Attractive Results","My husband is struggling over the assembly of this bookcase as I write. The wood is split and scratched in places. An Allen screw head is stripped, the Allen wrench is weak and bending, a screw is sticking out making it difficult to insert the little wooden screw-cover. The wood is mismatched in places. BUT, (an hour later) now it's finished and it feels sturdy and looks attractive from across the room. So, overall, I'd say, ""You get what you pay for."" What can you expect for less than a hundred dollars. It's an ""over-flow"" bookcase in a back room and I don't regret buying it."
2,"Missing Holes, Not That Easy to Assemble","On the left side panel, 3 out of 8 holes for the back braces were missing. It took two people to assemble. The final product is decent. But for the price I paid, I expected higher quality in manufacturing."
4,Excellent book shelves,"It baffles me why these shelves did not come fully assembled, so -1 star for that. The instructions were clear and all the tools you need are included. It took me about 15-20 minutes to assemble the shelves.The quality seems to be very good and I am using them (I ordered two of these) in my kitchen to store my frequently used pans, mixing bowls, knives etc. and I have placed some cutting boards on the top. They have made a huge positive impact in my kitchen and I don't think I can live without them!"
1,Hardware cheap - shelves are filthy...,"Received this today - the only positive is that shipping cost 4 bucks and we received it in one day. The negative is that the shelves appeared real dirty, I mean that they look like the wood they used was from a poor grade of wood and 2 of the 3 shelves were cracked. The routered slots were chipped and it seems that they QA was sleeping on this order. The hardware is pitiful. The hex wrench is cheaply made and half the screws are stripped on the hex head markings. I had to dig up some philips screws to use. Will not buy from this company again. NEVER!"
5,My Book Review,"This was a very good book. The characters were interesting, and the plot was, too. The book was funny without being silly. DWJ is my favorite author, and she's done well with this book."
2,"Same faults as ""Dark Lord of Derkholm""","Like its predecessor, this book should have been better than it actually is. Like its predecessor, it is full of things the reader should apparently already know, too many characters, too many plot elements that are used to no good effect, too many deus ex machina solutions, and some disturbingly dark elements that I don't find appropriate in a book aimed at children. And in ""Year of the Griffin"" you can add to that some utterly silly plot holes.I don't know, some may find this unfocused tale of students at wizard school seeking to redefine what magic is and can be engrossing . . . But I didn't, because the characters aren't very interesting, there is no sense of time passing, the issue of magic's potential goes nowhere, and the novel ends as an excuse to reintroduce characters from ""Dark Lord of Derkholm"", tie up a few loose ends, and marry everyone off.Disappointing."
4,Definitely as good as the first,"I really enjoyed this book. Dark Lord was a change of pace for me; not what I usually read; but it hooked me. So when I found out it had a sequel, it made my day.Year of the Griffin is entertaining, funny, somewhat unpredictable, and just plain marvelous.It was nice to get to know Elda, and her five classmates ensure that the beginning of school will be anything but normal.The descriptions of their spellcasting were very funny, and I must admit to laughing outloud when Felim was encased in a beehive of books.I would recommend this book highly to anyone who wants to finish a book with a smile on their face."
3,Loved it(not as much as Darklord of Derkholm),I really loved this book but unfortunatley it did not reach the high and extremely lovable standards of Darklord of Derkholm but it was still wonderfully Diane Wynne Jones!!!
5,Great book!,"Wonderful book, fast paced and kept my attention! I would definitely read this author again!"
4,"entertaining read, although not her best","i'm an avid fan of DWJ's earlier works ... although i like the world of -dark lord- and -griffin- better than the chrestomanci or cart and cwidder novels, the characterization and plot here seems more forced than her previous books, such as -hexwood-, -archer's goon-, -fire and hemlock-, and -howl's moving castle-. the book lacks DWJ's more typical clever plot twists and page-turning action (the bulk of the story takes place at the wizard university and consists of more reaction than action) ... still, DWJ juggles her large cast easily and the book contains her characteristically readable text and her great sense of humour, along with creative situations and characters, such as seven miniaturized assassins teaming up with pirates who have been turned into mice and two characters who have jinxes. not her best book, but worth reading ... better than -dark lord-, in my opinion."
5,Uplifting,"The great advantage of using Amazon.com is one has an opportunity to listen to a sample of a CD prior to purchasing it. I did this with PRIME MERIDIAN. This opportunity caused me to purchase it.I love the stylishness of the tracks on this CD. For me, the music has a calming effect. When I know that I am going to have a bad day at the office, I’ll listen to this CD while driving to work. When I arrive, I don’t feel so bad.Listen to the samples that Amazon.com offers. If you find the music uplifting, buy it. You won’t regret it."
5,"Two Scoops, Please","Rick Sebak is a genius. He makes us happy by showing other people... being happy! It's contagious!But ""An Ice Cream Show"" is also informative. Learn how much milk fat it takes to qualify an ice cream as 'premium.' See how cones are made. Delve into the technological mysteries of Penn State's Ice Cream Lab.So sit back and enjoy the road trip as Rick visits ice cream lovers across the USA. Then complete your Sebak culinary trilogy withA Hot Dog ProgramandSandwiches That You Will Like. Mmmmmmmm!"
5,Delicious,"PBS what more do I need to say, they make great shows! Travel to all kinds of ice cream shops, learn a little history, hear of some flavors better left untried. Pure enjoyment."
3,thanks for a plethora of great entertainers in a pair of minor memories,"a fun double feature. the latter is most notable for the work of george burns & gracie allen, doing what they did so well; the former, starring w. c. fields, is best remembered for the brilliant sequence wherein bob hope (in a duet w the sadly forgotten shirley ross) introduces ""thanks for the memory"". not a must-see, but a good enough way to while away an evening."
3,Nostalgia,"Both of these movies have very enjoyable moments. Neither is strong on plot. College Swing has some fun Burns and Allen. The Big Broadcast is a dogs dinner of a movie, with a preposterous W.C.Fields plot moving haphazardly along parallel to a shipboard entertainment/romance plot. Fields does not wear well. This movie is memorable for the introduction of Thanks for the Memories by an impossibly young and dashing Bob Hope and Shirley Ross, which is worth the price of the DVD. Tremendously charming."
4,An all time Classic for Posterity,"The Big Broadcast of 1938 is a blast! Bob Hope's first film in which he plays a cruise ships' entertainment director with W.C. Fields as a ship's Captain. The first ever premier of Bob Hope's theme song ""Thanks for the Memory""."
3,Meh...,"First off, I would like to say that until I tried this color I have loved absolutely every other punky colour shade that I've tried. I've been in love with the reds and purples that I've tried. But Alpine Green came out a weird sort of muted blue green and then after a week or so turned blue. It was a lovely color of blue, yes, but I was hoping for a pine green. Yes, I bleached before hand. I will say that once it turned blue, it stayed nice and bright for a couple months. I've had great experience with punky colour lasting for weeks on end. Definitely the best crazy hair dye I've used, and I've tried them all. I was just disappointed in this particular color..."
5,greaat!,The product is amazing.this is the second time I've bought it. If you like dark green/turquoise hair then this is for you.Also it came before the expected date and was very quickI am very satisfied with my new product! :D
4,It's About Time Some one told the truth...,"I read this book and I must say that it is about time someone told the truth about the Spirit of Jezebel and how it operates in the church. It is such a sham and shame that leaders don't take this book and look in the mirror. Jezebel is controlling ministries and maybe the ministry that you are sitting in - it would explain the ungodly decisions, behaviour and why the Word of God can be preached but the people are not set free, restored or salvation is not born in their hearts. This book spells it out! Jezebel is not after you but is after those in authority whether male or female. Are you a leader in a ministry? Get this book!Evangelist Rose Robinson"
4,This Bluetooth phone is amazing!,"I purchased this phone and love it! Granted, it is a bit complicated at setup, however, if you are patient, and read the instructions thoroughly, and apply some common sense and test the unit as you go along, it will be well worth the effort in the long run. I have never had to call tech support - I just read the instructions and set the main headset, base and additional handset up, and paired the base with my Motorola bluetooth headset for a terrific wireless experience! I work from my home office, so I have my personal phone line on line two, and my work line ringing on line 1, and can pickup either wirelessly with my motorola bluetooth headset! Yes, you have to re-pair your bluetooth headset each time you connect it to another device (like your cell phone) or charge it, but again - well worth the little effort. Everyone says the connection is clear, so I am thrilled with this product!"
1,only looks good,"Olympia CDP 24206 2 line phone.The design is great, neat and compact. Unfortunately from there on its down hill all the way. Far too complicated to set up, menu driven screens, so at times its impossible to dial or even answer the phone if in the wrong screen.Range and sound quality is good, but echo on one line. Screen is far too small to read, and dial pad also too small on both base station and hand set. More complicated than any cell phone I have used and less intuitive.Within first day had to phone the customer service line 3 times for help for functions that would not work or difficult to set up. Wave Industries provide excellent online support, but not enough to make up for a very disappointing system.To sum up, far too many features, far too complicated and makes even the most simplest tasks like phoning out, receiving calls and redialing a mission.After 3 days of trials, I'm reinstalling my old single line cordless phones and returning the Olympia CDP to the store."
4,Interesting Wright Video,"This is a short (about 55 mins) but interesting video about Olgivanna Wright and her role in her husband's life and architecture. What I liked best about it were the appearances by people whose names I had read many times, but had never seen them or heard them speak, such as Wright's grandson Brandoch Peters, daughter Iovanna, and apprentice Charles Montooth, to name just a few. If you're a Wright fan, and you still have a VHS player, this tape is well worth watching."
5,Catfish Honeymoon Rocks!,"This CD ranks no.1 among all others on my IPOD these days. A little bit country, but more rock and roll, this band can jam with the best of them. Their lead singer Katrina's impressive vocals combined with charming lyrics leaving you wanting more. Once you hear a few songs, you'll be hooked! Any smart alt-country fan will add this one to his or her collection!"
5,One of a kind,"Story's music is of its own world. Pure vision, pure integrity. As an artist, this is both his strength and his limitation -- you'll find Beguiled and Shadowplay pretty much of the same fabric. Of these Perfect Flaw is the most compelling, and it sets out a musical path that opens inner worlds and cuts to the quick."
3,"Simple, sweet, but rather ordinary","Bless 'Hearts of Space', for Stephen Hill and company have given us decades of (often) great one-hour sound mixes on this well-loved weekly HOS program. They also produce CD albums, this being one of them. I would characterize Fatal Flaw as middle-of-the-road HOS stuff, somewhat on the saccharine side, with simple, spare melodic development. I would say that the short Fatal Flaw 'theme', played twice on the album, is the best thing on the entire CD. Too, I would take issue with the reviewer below who says that it is ""the most important album of the 1990s"", or ""life-changing"". You have to be joking. This is laughable. This is nonsense. One commonly encounters on Amazon such breathless hyperbole and exaggerated praise."
5,Blue Horizon,"This is the third time in thirty years I read the Courtney Family Adventures. In 1981, living in Singapore and working in Indonesia Harry Skinner introduced me to Wilber Smith and ""When The Lions Feed"". I am currently rereading his novels. Wilber Smith is and for the past three decades has been my favorite author. By enjoying his novels you have a grasp of where Africa is in today's Times as well as a sense of its history. If you are looking for an adventure, how about the exploration of a continent, ever wanted to go big game hunting, why not a swashbuckling tale of the high seas, Zulu' s, the Boer' s and never to forget family and love. Just pick up a Wilber Smith novel, kick back with a cup of coffee and enjoy the journey."
1,Very unreliable,"Let me start of by saying I am an experienced boater who has use tons of different VHS radios. This one has to be the worst. I was on my boat, riding around in the keys, when my boat conked out. I felt no need to flag down another boat and spent. 5 minutes trying to start it. Soon, I realized my engine was on fire . As I prepared to abandon ship, I grabbed my iPhone Ina lifeproof case and this VHS radio. I turned on the VHf tochannel 16, and made 5 mayday calls. I tried repeatedly with no success. Eventually I had to use my phone to call the coastguard. So basically the one single time that I will most likely ever have to use a VHF, this one failed me. I will never use this radio again."
2,Uniden 250 G,Sign range is line of site - maybe 300 yards. Tryied to call Unidem for a adapter jack for the top - no help at all. Customer Service there is a joke. Do not buy this product - you will be disappointed.
3,Not fot getting wet,"I inherited this radio when I bought my 26' sailboat. It was my primary radio for two years before I finally installed a proper wired radio. In those two years the radio was reliable and the battery life was fine except for one case; when I really needed it. While in 12' seas approaching a port, two coast guard ships steamed straight at us. The radio worked briefly before quitting. Yes it was getting soaked from spray but it's advertised as ""Waterproof"". The radio stopped working and we had to yell over the waves to the two CG boats while they informed us that we had no chance of entering the port we were trying to get into because of breaking waves (and, with all certainty, muttered to themselves about how dumb we were). The radio worked fine after drying out but while we needed it most it wasn't there.This radio is probably fine most most use cases but it's not a true submersible radio. For about $25 more you can get one of those, I suggest doing it."
2,Water proof,"I use this radio for open water swimming events in salt water as a Pilot in a 15' Zodiac Inflatable or kayaks.Pro: Good ergonomics, has both 1 and 5 watts, clear communications, rechargeable batter or AA pack.Con: I was trying to make it through some waves in a kayak and the boat flipped. The radio was attached to the kayak and got wet, not for long and not at all deep. Now the display is fogged up and it doesn't seem to turn on.The ad says ""Water proof"", JIS4/CFR46 Waterproof Level. This is actually a level 4, out of 1 to 8, which only rates it for sea spray.Net: If this WAS water proof, I would recommend it. Since it is only rated for sea spray, I can not recommend this radio for boating. How does this get put in the Marine section I wonder?"
2,not a game changer,"Wasn't expecting much, but was hoping this would be a faster stripper. Turns out, takes longer because you are trying to setup 2 wires at the exact length you need while trying to balance the stripper to leverage both. Much faster just yanking one wire and stripping then grabbing another. And missing out on some lower gauge strip holes."
5,Swingy Ding Ding,I have to tell you all look no further for your swing injection. This is the band that put swing back into the N.Y.C. scene. The engine behind this band is Tony Corbiscello and his rhythm section. His choice of personnel is outstanding.This is the one!You won't believe your ears!
2,Real Time Band CD,"The performance is good, but the arrangements are like ""the big band"" era. (somewhat dated.)"
3,"Was suspose to be new, It wasn't","I had my Comswitch 7500 die after 3 years so I ordered this to replace it. It was suppose to be a new switch, but when it arrived it was obviously not! I hooked it up and it works, but I don't know for how long. A little disappointment in the Amazon system."
1,unsatisfying customer service,This product was not compatable w/ our phone system. Because I had removed the plastic wrap around the product it could not be returned at all. This does not seem right.
5,Plug in and go to work,"It is that easy, plug in the devices into the right outlets, determine whether you want semi-automatic or automatic (probably semi-automatic or ""home"" settings if you are using this device at home) and away you go. It took a trial period to be honest to realize that the ""home"" setting was the most appropriate, but there has not been any problems with voice mail - both from an answering machine and a provider service. Faxes get accepted on the first ring otherwise pass down the call to subsequent rings for answering. It is a clever device and well worth the money compared to purchasing monthly fax services."
3,The good and the bad.,"The Comswitch 5500 has been around for a long time and is a consistant performer,if you can get it programmed. I use it to catch fax transmissions before they go to my Avaya telephone system. Programming the switch requires patience and time. The actual wiring/hookup is simple, as Command Communications states. Programming is another matter. Read the program manuel and write down or highlight the programming that you want. Once programmed, it should work as stated.The 2nd but important fact about the unit is that it seems to have low resistance to any type of surges. I have individual surge protection on both my AC power source and my Bell lines for the phone system and the 5500. I also have a whole-house surge protector installed. I have two dead 5500 units in my basement now. Their power supplies seem OK. The units just will not power up.Still, inspite of it's faults, the Comswitch 5500 is the best unit I've found to date."
1,Returned it,"This product may be useful for some, but it wasn't for me. I have distinctive ring and caller ID on my line, and called the manufacturer before ordering to ask whether it would work in that configuration. They said yes. But in reality it only works partially - with most phones, the caller ID shows up for a second or so, and then disappears again, because the box actually picks up the phone to listen for fax tones. This is unnecessary with distinctive ring, and causes the caller to be billed even though he only hears a ringtone. I sent it back the same day I received it."
4,New Fax User,"Being someone who knows nothing about how to hook up computers and other equipment, I found it extremely easy to do. One problem I had is that the instructions did not tell me I had to have a splitter for the phone line into the wall to hook up both my moden and the Comswitch. Otherwise it has been working quite well but sometimes have to restart the computer when new security software is loaded or I cannot receive faxes. Still working on figuring out why some phones only ring once but overall it is an amazing device that takes care of the occasional faxers needs."
1,Not on a braodband,It may be great on the normal landline but not on a digital voice or broadband. It will not work if you try to hook up fax machine and a digital voice or broadband.
3,"Works, but not perfect","This box works OK most of the time, but sometimes it doesn't direct the calls propertly. I have it set up for three items: voice, fax, and computer modem with a phone which can be answered (or used) if picked up before the modem kicks in. When I'm using this third line for voice, I often get disconnected or ""toned out"" because it won't shut out other activity properly. I don't know what else is on the market, and it's certainly reasonable enough, so it's OK for what it is, but it's not perfect."
5,Command Comm Comswitch 5500 Line Sharing Device,"I recently started a home based business and just didn't have it in the budget to have two phone lines (one for a fax). I use a DSL line for internet as well as fax and phone line. I knew about the Command Communications switches from working in the computer industry years ago and decided to give them a call to find out if it would work with a DSL Line. The very first person I spoke with knew the answer to my question and I was only on the phone for about two minutes. This handy piece of equipment worked right out of the box without any effort or programming. I did have to put in a DSL filter (supplied by my phone company), but that was a piece of cake and worked right away."
5,Does what is says it does.,"I needed a box to route calls to the answering machine and the fax machine. In particular I needed one that could route on distinctive ring.This one works like a champ.The documentation is good enough to walk you through any setup you might need. Older reviews suggested that you needed to call for support. At some point they updated their documentation, I did not need to call for help with distinctive ring.I'd buy one again."
3,Just so-so,"Even after following the instructions which came with the unit & those accompanying my FAX machine, it doesn't route the fax messages properly."
5,excellent equipment,"Our old Commswitch died on us, so we went searching for a new one or something to replace what it did. Not one store even knew what we were talking about. Got online and found it immediately. It does exactly what it says it will do. Makes our life a whole lot easier! It takes all the extra work out of running our business!"
5,Command Communications Comswith 550,"Excellent results. This product has allowed me to link my fax to my primary phone. I was able to drop a second phone line, combine one phone line for voice/fax and save a lot of money."
5,A working man's wireless router.,"I've had two prior wireless routers and was often plagued by dead spots and signal drops at the most critical times when using my home office. My last router was a RangeMax from NetGear, a more useless product is hard to find. After wasting time and money on weak consumer products designed more for flashing lights than for function, I was lucky enough to get this Linksys wireless router. Set up was quick and easy. To my amazement it worked like it was advertised. I have 2 desktops and a laptop and can get a strong signal on any room in my house. How nice for a change, truth in a product's claims."
2,VPN does not work with this router.,"I'm a network engineer. If you plan to use it to allow an incoming VPN, do not purchase this router until the firmware is upgraded from 1.01. It's currently Dec 2, 2006 and the firmware has not been upgraded since it's release in November 2006. Otherwise, the router is decent.From Alan Bryant, ""Empirical evidence suggests that the GRE protocol is not properly handled internally to support the pass-through scenario. The connection can be made to port 1723 on a Windows server behind the firewall when passed through the Linksys, but without proper GRE handling, the VPN connection can't actually be established.""I can confirm this to be true with my WRT54GR."
3,Locks up in one location but ok in another.,"Could not figure out this router. At my fiancee's house this thing would lock up the internet connection for all wired users but be ok only on the wireless. Would have to pull the plug to get the internet back but then would lock up after only a few minutes again. Tried all the tricks I found on the internet, but still crashed. Put a Netgear in it's place which works perfectly. What's odd is it works fine in my house with both wireless and wired connections. Deducted couple of stars for this odd behavior, but again in my house it works just fine as did my previous Linksys wired broadband router. The browser interface is workabe but now that I've seen the Netgear, feel the Netgear's browser interface is a little more friendly and polished."
2,Not very imaginative,"I was looking forward to reading this, as I am a big Joyce fan. I found this book boring, however, and considering it is a work of fiction, a little unimaginative. The speculations seem to hover in that murky place between fact and fiction."
1,Do not waste your money,"This toy looks cool in the package, but it is poorly made. The claw no longer grasps after only three months. In fact the claw won't even open at all. My seven year old, who is very responsible with his toys and does not misuse them, is very disappointed in this cheap toy. The gears are all poorly constructed plastic. Don't let the name ""Armatron"" fool those of you who remember the TOMY Armatron sold by RadioShack back in the 1980s. This toy is junk and not worth any price."
3,Keeps breaking all the time,It arrived in a non-working condition. My husband disassembled it and fixed. But one of those gripping things keeps breaking all the time. It's OK fun when it's working.
1,Bait and switch,"The image used for this items posting is a bottle of Generic Benadryl by Qualitest, 50mg, 1000 pill supply.The item shipped was not the Qualitest brand but another knock off generic.I have been purchasing generic Benadryl for years and came to trust the Qualitest brand. I have also had poor experiences with some of the others. Hence my reasoning for making this purchase. Unfortunately they did a bait and switch and sent me another brand. I find this inexcusable for a company to practice deceptive sales tactics."
5,Best way to buy this product that I have found.,Everyone in my family has alergies. So we use a bunch of alergie products. This is the best deal I've found on a tried and true product. It also helps when I have trouble sleeping.
3,The Sword and the Chain Redux,"The Silver Crown is no worse and no better than The Sword and the Chain. Like its immediate predecessor, it seems to have no real theme other than the use of violent means to achieve noble ends. The promising theme of The Sleeping Dragon - the adaptation of people from our world to a fantasy world - has been all but abandoned. What we are left with is not much more than entertainment; enjoyable but neither provocative nor moving.To be fair, there is a suggestion that the true plot of the series is a long-term effort by erstwhile professor Deighton to control the fantasy world. Deighton even makes an appearance in The Silver Crown. It could be that an incredibly complex storyline is about to emerge, in which case my opinion of books two and three may have to be revisited. For now, however, I remain of the view that The Silver Crown is a harmless read that should be enjoyed by most fantasy readers who don't mind a bit of violence in their stories."
3,Great resource book but lacks depth,"If you are looking for a good book on what Type 2 diabetes is about then this book is the one for you. As a new to diabetes patient I was looking for some real tips and depth on how to manage my eating and diet. This book did not offer anything new that you could not find in other sources or the internet.It is well laid out and written with a good beginners guide on how various food intereact with your body. It has all the basics you need to understand what is going on with your body. Also some very basic guide lines on Calorie intact and exercise.But to call it a Complete Food Mangement Program is a bit misleading. I was expecting more indepth talks about the relation ship between meal time and blood sugars. More indepth about how exercise works in conjuction with proper eating and keeping your blood sugar lower. I realize that everyone is different in terms of what the basic needs are, but more numbers would have been nice."
5,Don't politicize this movie -- enjoy it!!,"I'm not a Bob Hope fan at all, but this really is a good horror/comedy. The funny bits are funny, and the spooky ones are truly spooky, and I remembered much of it quite well from seeing it several times as a kid. Of course, Willie Best's role as Hope's 'colored' manservant is stereotypical, but it's also the best performance in the movie! As one reviewer says below, Best steals the show. Objections to racial norms of the 40's -- the use of the word 'colored,' the man/servant relationship -- based on 21st century ""progressive"" understandings of such things are silly exercises in anachronism, akin to faulting 19th century authors for not using so-called ""gender-inclusive"" language. Forget the political correctness -- just watch this movie and enjoy it!!"
5,Bob Hope Classic mixed with Universal Horror!,I have almost every Classic Universal and Paramount Horrormovies. Someone gave this to me thinking it was the same.To my surprise it is except Bob Hope and his sidekick makeone joke after another. Best line Zombies are like Democratsthey do nothing! You wouldn't hear that today! The movie hasthe hero and the girl and a spooky old castle with ghost andzombies. I'm glad to add this to my collection. Great movie!
5,Ghost Breakers Entertains,"The 1940 Ghoist Breakers will bring many smiles and occasional laughs. While the characterization is inconsistent and at times confusing, this is after all a Bob Hope comedy and not cinema verite. Willie Best, who portrays Hope's man servant, makes this movie. His side comments and facial expressions add much of the comedic element to this movie. Viewers seeking scares and dramatic tension will be disappointed as these elements, when present are mild and rather quickly dispelled comically. The wrestling scene with a zombie seems to fall right in line with the current zombie movie interests."
3,the Ghost Breakers,"I saw the movie first when I was a child. Sometimes when you get old movies, you're disappointed. I'm still glad I got it, but it isn't quite as great as I remembered."
3,Hold your ghosts!,">I purchased this video after listening many times to the 1940's radio version of it, and I have to confess that, while the film version is OK, the radio version was much better, primarily because of Hope's ad-libbing and the supporting cast which had the audience is stitches!"
4,De las mejores peliculas de Bob Hope,"""The ghost breakers"" se conoció en Uruguay como ""El castillo maldito"". Tiene un reparto excelente. Por supuesto se destaca Bob con sus habituales chistes orales mas que con los gags del film. Paul Lukas y un joven Anthony Quinn también resaltan con sus actuaciones. Paulette luce no solo su belleza sino que está corecta en su rol.La trama tiene un hilo de suspenso y es una correcta parodia de las películas de suspenso de la época. El interés no decae en ningún momento y es recomendable volverla a ver de cuando en cuando.Damián"
4,Solid DVD transfer and fun packed extras,"Solid dvd transfer does justice to Bob Hope/Paulette Goddard romp. While not flawless (at times the print is speckled and the elements were not restored), this dvd transfer is sharper, glossier and more satisfying than any previous home version of THE GHOST BREAKERS available.The dvd is packaged with a lot of fun extras that add to the disc's collectibilty. These consist of the film's theatrical trailer (one of the best I've seen from that era, by the way) a behind the scenes mini feature about Bob Hope entertaining the troops, and a collection of vintage Bob Hope short subjects.My ONLY complaint is that they saw fit to cut Judy Garland singing OVER THE RAINBOW from ""COMMAND PERFORMANCE 1944""--I think if you are going to include the short at all, it should be in its entirety. This is a very minor quibble, though.All in all, a wonderfully presented dvd package!!"
4,old charm at its best,"I absolutely love this old movie! I pull it out around Halloween each year. A must have for my spooky-but-funny library. If you enjoy this movie, you will also like the Ghost and Mr. Chicken with Don Knotts. Lots of laughs with a little mystery!"
1,Unpleasant racial role,"Although I didn't find this to be as funny as Hope's best (My Favorite Brunette in my opinion), the role of Willie Best as Hope's foolish, terrified, ignorant servant made the movie unwatchable for me. See his imdb profile to see what you're in for. I've read negative comments about Snowflake's role in movies like the Palm Beach Story, but I wasn't really bothered by that movie, because of his relatively small role, consideration of the times, and the silly behavior of those with whom he acted. In contrast, Best's role here is so large, and in such contrast with Hope's essentially brave, dashing, role, that I found the movie painful to watch."
5,Old movies are the Best Moview,"I just finished watching this movie...I had watch this many year's ago..maybe a couple of time's. It is still as good as it was then. The transfer is excellent..the sound altho in mono sound's like sterio.A very crisp clean copy on DVD. I will take exception with a reviewer her as it is stated that the remark Bob Hope made was racist...It is not. He say's that if it get's any darker in here, he will have to paint him (Willie Best) white to see him. Nothing racist about that remark at all. Only true. It is too bad we can't have movies like this any more. NO profanity..no nudity...just plain fun to watch. Buy this you will not be dissapointed.<>L<>"
1,It leaks,"It's a two piece bakeware, and it leaks. I guess your batter has to be real thick. I had a tough time cleaning my oven."
2,returning the pan,"This pan is not good for baking angel food cake, because most recipes require that you invert the pan in order to achieve the right volume for the cake, but because of the non-stick surface, the cake just falls right out of the pan. While the bottom is removable, which makes for easy cake removal, on this type of pan, some of the batter seeps through the bottom. Because of this I plan on returning the pan tomorrow."
4,Mental Maturity,"The Competitive Edge, written by a former college running star, intends to hammer home the importance of the mental side of distance running training. It lays out very good explanations of why the mental side of running is nearly as important as the physical and what you can do to improve your concentration, overcome anxiety, and develop mental toughness, and it does so through a very readable and easily understandable text. It is slightly dated (the references to and testimonials of running stars of the past and personal no longer carry the same weight they may have in the early 1980s), but it certainly made me realize the importance of preparing myself mentally for races and training. This is not an inspirational book, but certainly a wonderful reference tool for coaches and athletes who hope to get a little more out of themselves."
5,My Favorite Bob!,"This is delightfully hysterical film starring funnyman Bob Hope and showcasing the gorgeous Madeline Carroll. She really shines and gets to show off her comedic talent. Carroll did so many serious roles like ""Secret Agent"", ""Lloyds of London"", that it is refreshing to see her act in a screwball comedy while maintaining some sense of dignity. They have wonderful chemistry. I especially love the scene where Bob gets to ""rough-up"" Madeleine in order to have the police called to the scene to provide safe escort from the building. The villians are wonderful and Bob gets the best of them. My favorite Bob Hope film. Oh yes, the bonus Star Spangled Rhythm movie is a good look at Hollywood's morale-boosting war contribution. The skit showcasing the three gorgeous ladies from Paramount - Paulette Goddard, Dorothy Lamour, and Veronica Lake is hysterical."
4,Bob Hope VINTAGE movies - AWESOME -,"The delivery took a lot longer than is usually characteristic for AMAZON.COM. The quality of the DVD was very good, and since I enjoy these 'old timey pictures' it is a joy to watch, re-watch, and re-watch. If you like b-movies, Go for the GOLD that was left for us by our for-bearers!!Classic TV Comedians"
1,Not worth it!,"I have ps2 games that are easier than this! I am a pretty good gamer and I cant even get past the second level in this game. The graphics are ok but the control sucks, you die way to easily and have to start all over again. Put it this way: it was easier to BEAT Zelda with all the weapons and potion jars and all that, than it was just to pass the first level of beauty and the beast! My 8 yr old daughter beat mario 1 and 2 and still cant get past the first level of this game! Its sooo not worth it! stick to the classics like Mario all stars, mario kart, zelda, zombies ate my neighbors and tetris!!!"
1,avoid it,"I bought this two months ago, and after one month I happened to look inside when I filled it and saw that the water was full of flakes; the bottom was falling apart. needless to say i tossed it in the trash, and now i'm even more annoyed to see that though I paid 35 dollars for it is now 14.99.not worth it either way."
1,After only 1 year,"After only one year, it's rusting from the bottom seam! I'm disappointed and only proves my point once again....you get what you pay for!"
5,Ooooo - shiny!,"This is actually a great tea kettle! I bought it to replace a Pfaltzgraff that had basically rusted inside - who knew you shouldn't leave water in a kettle :)This does not have a kettle, which for me personally was great. I find kettles with whistles annoying. Oddly enough, you can actually ""hear"" when your water is boiling. When you turn the fire on under it, it makes a slight bubbling sound - then goes quiet once it reaches a boil.It's easy to keep it clean; pours very smoothly compared to my old kettle; and is a perfect size for a few cups of tea. My only peeve initially is that the handle does not rotate - it's a fixed handle, but I got over it quickly enough."
2,Max fill is about 1/2 below spout!,"You can only fill this tea kettle to the Max fill line which is 1/2"" below the spout. So you are just filling the first third of the kettle.If you look at the picture of the kettle you can see the imprint on the kettle that shows the Max Fill Line. There are times when you want to fill the tea kettle almost to the top for more water -you can't do that with this kettle."
2,Teakettle,The teakettle arrived broken and was not able to exchange for a new one. It was sent back and I puchased a different one from a local store.
1,Angela,"I've had this teapot less than a year. I bought it because I liked the look of it and it was one of the very few that did not have a whistle. Well, like many others have reported, it has a lower fill line than I expected. I could live with that, but the inside is completely corroding. It's disgusting and I'm throwing it out. How can I make tea, hot cocoa or anything I plan to injest with the entire inside corroded? Disgusting!Choose another one... as I'm having to do now."
1,Not really 2.5 quarts...,"Maybe this kettle would hold 2.5 qt if filled completely to the top, but the maximum fill line is way below the spout. Check out the enlarged photo to see line. We did not measure how much it will hold when filled to the ""maximum"", because as soon as we opened it, we knew it was going back. Disappointing..."
3,Calif Bill,"Not a bad value, but you get a lot of sizes that you my never use, but still at this price you get your moneys worth"
5,Great bungie cords,"These bungie cords are high quality and have as ""safe"" of a design possible. It's a great assortment; my only complaint is the plastic container broke during shipping."
5,Bungee Cords nuff said,What can I say there are enough in the pack to secure two bikes have some in the car and still have a few left over.they are strong versitile and attractive. No complaints.
2,Not hooked on these...,"Based on the review I seem to be the only naysayer of this product but I find the hooks to be unusable for my applications.I have older bungees with more traditional hooks; they're longer, the curve goes further around, and they're strong with only a single piece of metal so they can be hooked in to small areas. I found with the hooks in this canister that I could not get a them to stay in place in a number of different applications. I could not get them to adequately link together unless stretched incredibly taught. And the loops are too short to hook back to the bungee around large items. I just didn't feel safe using them and I ended up returning them."
4,Quality Bungee but beware of the hooks,"These are good bungees, and function well in extremely cold temps, as some bungees lose elasticity in the cold. They come in a wide assortment, but the small/ minature bungees are kinda a joke, not sure why or how you would use them. The selection of different sizes is nice. The other positive are the bungee balls for securing tarps, and things with grommets. The down side of these bungees is the hook, as it is non-traditional, kinda a double wrapped hook, which makes them heavier and possibly harder, impractical, or impossible to use for your application. I was planning to use them for strapping cargo to the cargo rack on my polaris snow mobile, but the hooks make it difficult. I need a thin hook for my application. If your application requires a thin hook, think twice about these. Also, the plastic container they store in was crushed on arrival, because it is so cheap, despite the shipping box being unmarred. Over all these seem like a good value"
4,Decent,"I bought these to help me when moving. I was not able to hook them to the sides of u-haul truck, but was able to ti things OK. The cords are very strong, what could make it tricky when using the shorter ones. I gave it four stars because the hooks could be easier to hook to one another."
5,useful assortment of cords; buying another set now,"I'm writing this review as I prepare to order another set. Bought the first set about a year ago. Have used them to hold down tarps over piles of firewood through the winter at 6,000 ft elevation, to lift up & train limbs on young aspen trees that got bent down by snow, and various other more typical uses. They've weathered the winter well. I like the double hooks for my uses. I even found uses for the smaller cords with balls -- fastened temporary gates at top of two sets of deck stairs to keep toddlers safe. Good quality, good price."
5,Solid product,Excellent item. solid product! Various sizes help me to fit in any kind of fix. Great product although it's a bit pricy.
5,Road to Your TV,"The Movie stars Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour. This one has a story and it is full of fun surprises making it my favorite of all of the Road To Movies. Movies made back then.. were clean and were made to entertain. This one is a success."
5,Put It There Pal. . .,"Bing, Bob, and Dottie in another fun-filled romp, this time through the frozen landscape of Alaska in the early 1900's. Some great gags with plenty of laughs along with some quite lovely tunes. . .""Welcome to My Dream"", and ""Personality"" being just a couple. Road to Utopia takes on everything we have seen before in the previous three Road films, and presents the gags, the songs, and the themes that make a Road film a Road film, in a fresh and original way giving forth a cornicopia of fun and playfulness that makes watching this movie a real reel pleasure."
5,A Canadian Treasure,"I rotated this CD back home after a normal 2 week period at my office and promptly went into severe withfrawal. I found I couldn't enjoy my morning email without Susie's take on ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"". The Roger Miller tunes that follow are so seldom recorded anymore that Jordan Officer's playing on all 6 just puts a smile on my face. It's so nice to see a band that's at least a generation younger than Roger bring them back to life."
3,break out the floor pillows and hookahs,"This outing the group does mostly covers of (achingly sad) Roger Miller tunes.Compared to ""Pennies from Heaven"" and ""That's For Me"" this cd is sedate. Lot's of brushed percussion and slow rhythms, only occasional and lightly done solo's by Jordan.I kept waiting for them to tear it up but it never happens.I love this group. I believe Jordan Officer is one of the best players today. I guess I was expecting more fiery interpretations of smoking hot jazz.This offering is full of slow jams that calmly move you in subtle ways."
3,Too much of a good thing?,"Compared with the 3 previous albums this is a little too sedate.First problem is song selection. If it is at all meant as a salute to Roger Miller, he was very well known for fun songs. Susie & her great band could have given us a swing version of England Swings, no?By the Time I Get to Phoenix is ok, but Ruler of My Heart is gold.Second, the brushing is getting a little too much. Susie's voice and Jordan's guitar are great, the brushes by Susie should be used occasionally, more sparingly. More instrumental variety, for accents, would help. For example, clarinet or trombone parts would be nice.BTW I love Night Flight the instrumental. Whereas Leo's Blues was irritating. Too much'natural' fingering noise.I have all the cd's and look forward to more, and was lucky to see the group perform once. But this cd is not having the effect on me that I wanted."
5,10 stars,"Introduces igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. The writing is simple and remarkably concise for a book aimed at this age group. For example, ""Rocks form in three ways. In the first way, melted rock bubbles up from inside the earth. Then it cools down and becomes hard igneous rock."" Colorful and friendly looking book layout. Includes a rock chart, activities and an introduction to Mohs Hardness Scale. There is also a glossary, bibliography, & index. Karen Woodworth-Roman, Children's Science Book Review"
4,Science for young ones,This was a great book to help teach my young students more about rocks and minerals. I also purchased a Spanish version to teach them all bilingually. They loved them!
2,"Rocks, Hard, Soft, Smooth, and Rough",Very disappointed in both the book and the packaging by Amazon.com The bottom of the book is rippled and damaged by type of packaging used. I purchased this as a gift for a 7 year old. The book is not gift worthy due to damage and the content is geared at the 4-5 year old level. Not worth the price. My first disappointing purchase from Amazon.com
3,Warning: Installation with sink intact is very difficult,"I'm giving this product three-stars for the following reasons. First, I found this product at my local Lowes (after I'd already ordered from Amazon) for $10.00 cheaper than the Amazon price. Second, it took 10 days to ship. Third, the product came in a plastic bag, not a Rev-A-Shelf box. No mention of the product name on the instructions so I'm wondering if this is a knock off?Once installed the actual product is great. We were in the process of waiting for an integrated sink installation so my husband was able to install the Rev-A-Shelf product with an enormous open hole which made the panel removal and hinge install much easier. He said it was a good thing I didn't ask him to install after the sink was in place. Translation: good thing the sink wasn't there or I would be returning my tip out shelves unused."
2,"Basically, a giant correspondence table","""Magick Made Easy"" was somewhat of a disappointment. It didn't delve very deep into the subject of magic, and a quarter of the way through I realized all I held in my hands was a book about fluff.I *will* complement the author on the correspondence tables, though... Hundreds of items are listed with each of their magical purposes, and every magical purpose has a list of items capable of handling the task.Still, ""Magick Made Easy"" is only a so-so read."
5,A Spell Component Cookbook,"If you're looking around your home and want to know how to use everything magickally, this is a great book for you. Rather than being arranged by spell topic, it has components (both ancient and modern) in alphabetical order so you can mix and match your magick to perfection.For those wanting themes - there's a cross referenced index of spells, rituals, charms, etc. so you don't have to hunt for ideas (and there are a lot of them).LOVE the cover!"
5,Magick made easy,"I am a big fan of Patricia Telesco's works, as she offers practical usage for modern, everyday items in a magickal context. Although this book seems like a sequel to Spinning Spells, Weaving Wonders, it is different enough to warrant a purchase. The first part of the book, ""Off to 'Oz'"", answers common questions about magick, such as ""does folk magick have a religious element"", and Telesco offers her own rules of magick, much as Cunningham did. Getting started in folk magick is discussed, as is folk magick fundamentals. The second part of the book, the Components, is divided into Traditional and Modern components, and covers such items as coral, hawthorn, lead, snakes, batteries, blenders, and more. These entries are in alphabetical order and include themes, elemental correspondences, and sample applications. If you are looking for practical ways to use ordinary household items in your magickal practices, this book is well worth the price."
5,Great informational book,This book I believe is one of her best. I found the information was formed in a great way in this book with step by step exercises. I thought it was a great Wicca book for people first starting on their journey.
2,Not what I was expecting...,"I recently bought this book from an online retailer because of the reviews I read here on Amazon. I couldn't wait to get the book, but when I did, I was very disappointed! I was expecting a book that gave ideas but also told how to do the techniques... First, it does give ideas, but there is no need for instructions, because the ideas are very simple... Don't get me wrong, there are some very nice ideas, but it's nothing you can't find in any scrapbooking magazine or online. To me it looks like someone cut pictures of ideas/techniques out of other books & pasted them onto the pages of this book.I would highly recommend borrowing this book from a friend/library BEFORE you purchase it so you know what you're getting."
4,TV at last,"This tuner card works well.....if you have one of the video cards that support it such as any ATI video card, Nivida Riva 128, or TNT, 3Dfx Banshee,S3 Savage 3D. In other words you must have a Video card that supports overlays, as most of the better card do.It supports TV guide (free) and I use it to do timer recordings hooked to my VCR, without the complicated VCR setup.The actual TV image is good at the sized rate recommended, but drops off as the picture is enlarged."
1,"difficult to install, virtually no support, buggy software","I bought this product on sale, but it's not even worth the sale price. It ships with an old version of software, (MMC 7.6) and ATI expects you to pay for the latest version (drivers are free). Installation is a nightmare. Even though I followed their instructions carefully, I must have spent 5 hours trying to install it.The Guide Plus software that it comes with which allows it to function as a VCR is not supported by ATI or the company that creates it, Gemstar. I noticed the Bravo network is not included in the list of stations. There's no way to add it and no place to get support to find out how to add the listings, or to get Gemstar to add it.This puppy is going back."
1,a terrible product,"I purchased this product thinking at the very least i would be able to watch tv when i started the program. It won't even do that. It was all scrambled. When I went to their site, i saw that this was a common problem. Basically it occurs because i use a Nvidia video card and this is a Ati product. This malfunction must have been intentional because there are many free progams that can do this and this won't do and you pay for it. The softwae that comes with it crashes the computer regularly and prevents many other programs from running. After wasting my time looking for a fix on their site, i decided to look at some other sites. After many hours of searching, i found a fix (it was not made by ati) and after that the program worked. However this is something that ws intentional and should never have been released. I am never going to make the mistake of purchasing an ati product again."
2,Too Bad Big Foot Didn't Steal this Book Before I Read it!,"This collection of short stories fell very short of my expectations. Granted I had never heard of Joan Hess but the praise for Joan Hess reviews on the back all claimed she was an extremely funny writer so hence that is what I expected. Humour however is not contained within this novel, it is not that her jokes or comedy scenes weren't funny, it is just that they do not exist at all. This book is a B grade thriller but certainly not a humorous collection of stories. The quality of those stories as thrillers is also rather average. The stories are predictable and many an effort to stick with as well. Give this book a miss!"
2,has no padding,"Decent outer layer with plenty of room. Good zippers. But it is called a ""padded ski bag"" and there is NO PADDING!"
2,Horrible interface & not much depth,"I was expecting much more from this I guess. The interface was terrible and different from disk to disk. On the Pompeii narration the guy doing the talking wasn't even talking about what was on the screen..gak! I could have found what was these disks, on the net for free."
5,Vanity was spell binding.Each page brings new excitement.,Vanity was one of Feather's best.Octavia is a loveable person that you can easily identify with. She is all passion-motivated by love and willing to do what ever she is asked by her master lover Rupert-Lord Nick or Cullum.His main goal in life is to get even with his evil brother Philip no matter what the cost even the Love of his life. The love that grows between Octavia nad Cullum is unavoidable. What will it cost them? Read this powerful romance to find out. Loved it!
4,Nice,"All in all, this was quite a good book. Anyway, there were a few things I didn't like about it. First, I don't know why the prince had to appear in the book. It was totally unnecessary and made the book all the more unrealistic. Second, I hated hero's names (except for Lord Nick). Rupert and Cullum just aren't good names for heroes. Third, it is never explained why the hero is a highwayman. And the way Rupert was using Octavia (ah well, another horrible name), and the fact that he was sleeping with her while she was seducing his brother was just... well, not tasteful.I found it rather surprising that Octavia was so eager to jump between the sheets with Rupert. I doubt any well-bred lady of the era would do it.However, the part of the story where you could watch their feelings for each other grow was nice, and therefore four stars."
3,Details Details Details - Give Us A Break Already!,"I really enjoyed some of Jane's earlier books but this one just went on and on and on about the character's outfits! You know we only need a couple of paragraphs to get an idea of what the hero and his lady look like. By the way, can we stay away from incomplete storylines, please?"
1,I ordered an item and got another different.,It's amazing.I sent this item to Dominican Republic specting that it was delivered OK.Now the batery is in Santo Domingo.
3,"Love the ""Pet Stages"" Products in General but this one is just OK","I purchased this for my Yorkie puppy. Its about the length of the puppy and - while I think its a great idea - it doesn't stay warm very long. My puppy loves most of the ""mini"" Pet Stages toys, but really hasn't used this one much at all."
5,warm comfort,"I got this for my new puppy and she loved it right away. When she wasn't using it she would carry it around as it was ""hers"". unfortunately she eventually destroyed it as she is destructive with all her plush items. After 3 other Golden Retrievers, this is the first dog that destroys her toys. It it weren't for that, it was a great item for a new puppy away from her mom."
4,Great Hardware But Beware the Software and Setup!,"The hardware for this product performed flawlessly and found connection immediately. Unfortunately, I was unable to make the Midpoint software that is included ever work after 5 frustrating days. I wound up getting WinGate software to solve my software connection problems. D-Link tech support was very helpful and courteous, but unable to resolve my problems. WinGate tech support finally did after 3 calls.One down side of this package. The server box must always be on line and turned on for the client to connect to the Internet. If this is important, consider getting D-Link's configuration that includes the telephone carrier decoder/encoder in a separate box, rather than having a card mounted in a PCI slot. A router can then be used to connect the client rather than using a server computer."
4,Road To Zanzibar...Zaneybar....,"One of several 'road' films starring the trio of Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour. I grew up watching these movies and loved them all (which I now have!). Lots of classic laughs and zaney gags! Watch with some friends!"
3,"Not quite a classic, but darn fun","This is not the best of the ""Road"" pictures, but it's still a lot of fun to watch the chemistry between Hope and Crosby. The plot is a bit preposterous, and just how dumb can Hope's character be to be anything but Fearless? However, the hijinks are first rate scams, and there are nice turns by Dorothy Lamour and Una Merkel. The tunes are not the best of the ""Road"" series, although Bing's voice always seems stronger in films than in comparably dated records. Get this one not because it's a classic (not quite), but just because it's fun."
5,Wonderful book for kids and adults!,"This is an excellent book about God, written from a child's perspective. The story revolves around a child wanting to have God come down and play with him. It's great to see this perspective of God as a child's friend, as it enables the parent to nurture a personal relationship between the child and God, and it opens up opportunities for the parent to explain their personal beliefs in God. The book is very easy to read, and contains wonderful illustrations. I loved the book, and so do my kids!! It's already number one in the bedtime reading rotation."
5,A great book for interfaith families!,"It was nice for my husband and I to be able to share this book with our children, and send several as gifts to our Jewish AND Christian family members as well!""Come Down and Play"" is a great way to introduce/reaffirm to your children about having a personal relationship with God. It is a heartwarming story that is sure to become a favorite of the entire family."
4,Slight but Enjoyable,"This slim collection of one-and-two-page anecdotes barely qualifies as a book at all. Nor does it make up in profundity what it lacks in heft--the ""lessons"" that O'Neill gives to each of his stories seem artificial and forced, something his publishers nagged him into doing. But the stories themselves are great--arrogant politicians (often O'Neill himself) get their comeuppance, feisty constituents show their mettle, stupid election strategies win, smart ones fail. This is a great bathroom book."
2,TIp and his big ego,"The other reviews for this book amaze me... it seems that the other reviewers like their authors to relate common sense principles with a common thred of self-serving arrogance.Tip said nothing in this book that everyone doesn't already know. And his constant references to himself in 3rd person get annoying by the 10th page. Who actually refers to themself as ""a great man""???Tip does."
4,Old-Fashioned Funny,It may not be politically correct. It may seem quaint in some of its assumptions. Paleface is still downright funny.
5,"The Paleface, a fun film.","I've always enjoyed watching Bob Hope, he was such a master of comedy. And this film is one of his best, a silly whimsical western farce. I love the songs, ""Buttons and Bows"" is such a classic, it was even spoofed on the television show ""Frasier""."
4,Hope Hit,"My favorite Bob Hope moment of all time comes from this film. Not his amazing facility with a gag or a prop but when he sings ""Buttons and Bows"" in an attempt to seduce Jane Russell. It's a great song and wonderfully done. Hope never got to work with the great directors for some reason so his work is often overlooked today, but shouldn't be. Otherwise he'd be recognized as the most influential American comic actor of the sound era."
1,Cute But short on Endurance,Handle is secured by unthreaded rivits. I have one of these I plan to return from another source and the handle came apart the first use. Amazon should not carry this product as it is very poorly constructed.
4,Works great and nothing to break!,"I got tired of short-lived coffeemakers, and believe me we have quite a collection in the garage, so I decided to buy something foolproof. It takes a little trial and error to figure it out; if you don't turn it down when it starts to perk it boils over and if you let it perk too long the coffee burns - 8 minutes works for me. It does what it's supposed to do every single time, without fail, and the coffee is piping hot (be careful), unlike the machines. All for a really great price!"
1,not that great,"Have had the pot for 5 weeks. Had to ""adjust"" the lid so it would fit and wouldn't come off during percolating. Now the coffee basket has broken. Overall not too satisfied. Coffee is weak and most of the water boils away before the coffee is finished."
5,Excelent Product,Product lived up to its listed features. The person who received it as a gift was thrilled with it. Thank you.
4,EVEN BETTER THAN I THOUGHT...,"This jewelry was an excellent value; it is very, very pretty and it worked just beautifully for the formal function for which I ordered it. The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars is that I did have to buy a different chain for the necklace. I hope to have many more occasions to wear this set."
4,Very useful but not perfect,"Could have a bigger variety of examples, not only products and clients. There are some intellectuals who use the web too. It left me with questions about certain matters that could be answered by the book easily."
2,Advanced? Maybe if this is your second day at it...,"Having worked with Dreamweaver since version 2, I went out looking for something to get me beyond the basics that every tutorial covers. I saw ""Advanced"" and thought, ah-hah! I've found it!Nope. The topics it covers are about as in-depth as the Dreamweaver manual (which, of course, is free with your copy of Dreamweaver). If you are looking for how to create your own objects or behaviors, or how to really take advantage of the server scripting capabilities, this isn't your book.What it does cover, it covers clearly, so if you are just starting out with Dreamweaver, don't pass by the book based on its title. By the time you are ready for advanced, you won't need it."
5,Great Movie. A must for hockey fans!!!!,"This was made for TV movie for the CBC in Canada many years ago, I believe back in '95. I have read the book and this movie is dead on. It is only based on ""one"" chapter of the book so if you are a die hard hockey fan or just want to see a different side of hockey then watch the movie after you read the book. The dvd quality is good and the acting is great I think for a tv movie. I definatlty reccommend this for any sports fan. There is not a a whole lot of hockey played in the movie so if you are looking for a ""Miracle"" or ""Youngblood"" then this is not for you. This is about how the players banded together to fight for what was rightfully theirs and to have their voice heard. I took a Hockey Course through SMWW and this was one of our assignemts, to read this book. I also reccommend ""Money Players""."
2,Altec Lansing IM510 Speaker system,I ordered the Altec Lansing IM510 Speaker System and I was disappointed in the sound. It has a tinny sound. The directions it comes with were confusing. I shipped it back. Waiting for my refund.
5,LOVE IT,"It is very easy to use, and not a lot of bells and whistles so easy to figure out. I couldn't ask for anything easier....thanks"
3,A few problems but good overall,The IN510 has excellent sound quality given its size. But there are a few problems that Altec Lansing should think about if they make a newer similar speaker:(1) No remote. This isn't as much of an issue for me as I have no problem getting up and skipping to the next song.(2) The player has no volume memory and the default volume setting is quite loud. I would suggest leaving it on (it doesn't appear to get warm if it's not charging the player).
4,Not bad for the price.,With not much available for the Sansa I read the reviews and bought this unit. It looks well made and was easy to set up. The sound quality is better than I thought it would be. It will fill a room at a mid level volume. Going real loud will cause some distortion depending on song and the EQ settings on the Sansa unit itself.The speakers will sound better as they break in I'm sure. All in all a nice dock for the Sansa. I also like the fact that the dock will charge the player as its being played.My only nit pick would be the volume control on the top of the unit needs to be pressed harder that you would think to operate it.
4,Finally speakers for sansa mp3 players!,"I love these speakers. It isn't huge so I can place it on my desk and see what's playing on my sansa and delete songs as needed all while it charges. What finally sold me was it came with an AC adapter, usually portable speakers are only battery powered. The sound quality isn't bad for the price, I paid $[...].I didn't buy my speakers from amazon because I found them somewhere else cheaper with free shipping. I wish there were more docks for sansa products, everything out there is geared towards ipod. I gave this product 4 stars because it would be perfect if it came with a mini-remote."
4,Good speakers,"Good sound quality, nice to have player recharged while plugged in. Only negative is that you must disconnect the power to use the USB sync function (probably cause it also receives power via the USB, but haven't tried yet) and does not include the USB cable."
3,"Good, but design error","I like this docking station with speakers, but it has a major design flaw. In order to sync via USB, you need to disconnect the power cable. This makes no sense. It would be OK if you had to turn the speakers OFF to sync, but to have to remove the cable? So to use as speakers, remove the USB cable. To use as dock, remove the power cable. Yikes."
4,Altec Lansing for Sansa - very nice,"I must admit that when it comes to accessories, I get a case of ""Pod Envy"" as I walk through the store and see all of the cool things made for I-Pods. But this little speaker system made for Sansa .mp3 players is really pretty nice. The fidelity is terrific. The volume capacity isn't huge, but if I want to really rock out at home, I wire the sansa into my home entertainmnet system anyway. What the AL is nice for is the office, the bedroom, and it's always with me at band rehearsal so the guys can all hear something I want them to listen to without us passing the earbuds around.I hope this goes well enough for Altec Lansing that they'll expand the product line for Sansa players, or perhaps some other manufacturers can jump in."
1,Little speaker system...Big disappointment,"I don't know if the unit I got was a lemon, but it had very poor amplification even with the latest firmware on the e260.Returned it for the Altec Lansing IM4, which met my expectations for sound but the IM4 doesn't have a cradle that recharges while connected. All of these systems seem over priced for what you get."
2,Altec Lansing IM510 Speaker System,"Not the greatest sounding speaker system, lacks bass, sounds like a transitor radio. Also very overpriced for this item, very small and simple unit with not allot of options, but seeing not many units like this are available for Sansa they are sticking it to you. If you really want one you must consider the additional sub woofer as an option."
4,"small, good sound","This works well with our Sansa e280. Gets louder (and stays clear) than I had anticipated from such a small unit. Feels sturdy. I've read complaints about not having a remote... c'mon, are you kidding me???"
4,Completely Satisfied,"I had purchased this itemAltec Lansing IM510 Speaker Systemin November, 2007 after finding a Speaker System for my Sansa e250 MP3 player. Well, I finally used it today. Lost the booklet that was enclosed in the packaging and located Company via the Internet. Received video review about the product which more than explained usage. I followed through...setup was easy as pie, sound was more than I had expected. Sound and clarity was amazing. Portable, Compact size for traveling. Use of this product will be for my office and the sound filled my living room. Completely satisfied with this purchase! My only regret is....should have set it up long time ago. Definitely recommend! Sit back and enjoy. Kudos to the Manufacturer."
4,Good Sansa Product,"Good product, I love my Sansa players, we have a few of them. This provides a easy to use, good sounding speaker set for the players. The bass is good, but not deep. I don't understand why it does not come with a remote control. The Bass can be expanded with the Sub-woofer out, but not bad without. Nice overall design."
5,Great sound for a small device,"I really expected less, and was surprised by the great sound quality.the sansa even fits ok with a silicon case on.only downside, the dock comes out too easily."
3,NOT LOUD ENUFF!,Either I'm doing something wrong or the unit just does not play loud enough. I have to turn the speakers in my direction to hear the songs. Help!
4,good stuff,"for the size its very ideal for travelling/camping or wherever on the go when u just dont want to use the headphones. I was amazed at how loud this little thing is!! The sound is really decent, not top notch high quality audiophile but for the price u cant go wrong. Also its sweeet that it charges the sansa and u can hook up other things to it like a portable dvd player. GO BUY IT!!!"
5,Couldn't be more pleased,I bought this product for my Sansa c140 mp3 player. It sounds great and is very portable. It is perfect to take outside and listen to music while relaxing on your deck or porch. It comes with a very convenient carrying case that makes it easy to take anywhere. I like the fact that it runs on 4 AA batteries or with the AC power adapter. I have no complaints about the volume either like some of the reviews.
4,Good but not perfect,"First let me start with the good. There isn't a whole lot of options for portable speakers for the SanDisk (as far as I know, there is only one other speaker system available aside from the single speaker hookup), so i'm glad to say that the qaulity of this product is worth the money if you want to invest in a speaker system for it. The sound is clear and loud, and the SanDisk hooks in (and charges) very easily. The 2 complaints I have is that 1. there is no type of bass control at all.. This is a tad disappointing. and 2. there is no remote included. Altec Lansing's speaker systems for the iPod include a remote, to control volume as well as skip, stop and pause the mp3 player. This would have been a nice feature for the SanDisk version as well... But for 70 bucks, i'd say go for it because its the best on the market right now for the SanDisk speakers."
3,Ok but wouldn't buy again,Speakers sound good for the size. The subwoofer out option gives it great sound. The down side of this unit is having to unplug the power if you want to sync with the computer. They could have included a swich on the unit to turn on an off. With the USB plugged in you can't listen to your music. With the power plugged in you can't sync with the computer so you swap cables a lot and the USB is in a hard to get at place on the back of the unit.
3,"What, NO remote control ????","This product would be much better if it had a wireless remote to go with it. Come on people, if you are going to create products, go all the way. This product needs a remote and how about a remote style docking kit for cars too? Sansa is a good player but accessories to go with it need improvements."
4,Altec Lansing IM510 Speaker System,"This is a great unit for the price. Sound is good. only problem, is my mp3 player disconnects from it easy when using in a golf cart ride. But, if you are just using it on stable desk or counter it is fine. Volume is loud enough to hear at the beach."
4,Altec Lansing IM510 Speaker System For e200 Series Sandisk Sansa,"I bought this to take on vacation in a couple of weeks and couldn't be more pleased with it's performance. It's compact, lightweight and produces a sound I didn't think would be possible based strictly on it's size. It's gonna be a great vacation on the beach with this."
4,Altec Lansing Speaker System,I bought this for my Sandisk MP3 and it is terrific. The sound is excellent. I do think I will buy the subwoofer. Music with a lot of bass can sound a bit tinny.
3,eh. only 2/3 useful,"These other people are right. The bottom space is waay to narrow to fit a large skillet. And since the large skillet is the one that takes up the most space in the cabinet.... it's still a hot mess in there. But if you only have small skillets, this is the rack for you."
2,Slots too tiny,"This is a great idea and fairly well constructed, but the slots are too thin to hold anything deep. None of my nice cookware fits in it, I'm just using it to store my older stuff. I don't recommend."
2,Slots not wide enough,"I concur with some other reviewers. The slots are too narrow to accommodate any pan more than about an inch in depth. I was hoping this would work for me and plan to return it to Amazon as I have a couple large pans that are simply too deep.That being said, if your pans COULD fit this, I think it would work very well, as it's cheap and sturdy."
2,Other buyers are correct....too small,"As stated previously by other buyers, the rack is too small for my set of Calphalon pans. At the very best it will fit a 10"" omelet pan on the very bottom and it can't be too deep. It definitely will not fit a 12"" pan. I took the word of the one person who stated it worked for larger pans and they are wrong. Returning to Amazon."
5,Great Buy!,"This costume is adorable! Well made and inexpensive unlike other Superman costumes I've seen. This costume has the built in boots, a belt, and the superman logo on the cape. The size seems to be off though. My son was 26 months when he used it and it was just right. The packaging says 2t-4yrs but there is no way the costume would've fit in a few months. And my son is average in height and weight."
3,Its ok,"I purchased this for my nephew and he did love it but it was kind of tight and trust me when i say that he is so skinny, all bones, he kind of looks awkward in it but he's a kid and he liked it. The quality is not the best but not bad."
2,falling apart after one day,"giving it 2 stars because my son still loves it. However, after one day, stitching is coming undone and the S on the chest is peeling. Does nobody make a higher quality Superman costume? I would have paid more for something of a better quality."
2,Sad Superman,I bought this costume for my 3 year old son's Halloween. I left it in the package in the box so that NOTHING could happen to it before it was time to wear it. I should have pulled it out and at least looked at it. That was my mistake. When I took it out of the package as we were getting ready the back had runs in the nylon around the behind area and the stitching that held the top and bottom halves together had come apart in the back. It was awful. What a waste of money.
1,Very disapointment,"Poor quality, I'm very disapointment with this costume, I bought it thinking that was cute but I made a mistake."
1,Wondering About The Overall Quality,"I read the reviews on Disc 1 or 2 of the series and as far as I can tell, these jams were ported from vinyl with all of the imperfections, scratches, hisses, etc and without proper analog to digital transferring and related re-mastering. If that's the case with any or all discs in this series, they are worthless to me. I depend on digital production firms such as Rhino for their supreme re-mastering efforts. I am an avid collector of 12' re-mastered jams and may pass on this series [unless the process has improved for other discs in this series].Peace.."
4,"Not as described, but still great!","This crafting caddy holds all my scrapbooking tools, keeping them visible and accessible. The bag is sturdy and I love the purple canvas. It keeps all my essential tools corralled in one place, ready to grab for travel or to just move around on my craft table.The only thing a buyer should know is that the purple bag does not have the small container in the zippered bottom pocket. It says it does in the product description, and the alternate image with the brown bag shows a little plastic box. I thought it might be on the back side of the purple bag, but there is not a zippered pocket.Still, this is a great tool caddy even without the little box."
3,Not as Described!!!,I was really looking forward to this item but when it arrived I was disappointed. The purple bag does not have the zipper compartment with the storage box as described. The bag itself is very sturdy and well made but I bought this one because I really liked the storage box compartment. So needless to say I am not very happy with my purchase.
4,Functional and cute!,"This cute little tote is made of heavy-duty canvas and has tons of little pockets and pouches for storing often-used tools. It's so easy to just grab this bag and go! We love the small utility box that we use to hold brads for our projects. The handle easily slips over the extendable handle of our Petite Croppers. However, I could easily see non-scrappers using this to organize an at-home fix-it kit, paint supplies or even yarn or cross-stitch projects."
5,Roba rocks,"This is my second Assos RoboCap. I have worn the RobaCap on rides with temps from about 40 to 55 degrees. It feels good, wicks the sweat and does a nice job of insulating my ears from the cold and wind. I would highly recommend this product for use down to the 40's."
5,TWO THUMBS UP,Bought this for my husband. He loves it. He wanted a radio to use near the pool or when he is doing work. It is loud enough that when he's working he can hear it. He loves that he can plug in his ipod. He has nothing bad to say about it!
4,Works great and sounds great.,"I was tired of running the work truck battery dead listening to the radio and working under the street in Manholes, regular am/fm radios just didn't do the trick. While working on a new school there were some painters that had a similar dewalt radio and it sounded great so I figured I would give it a shot and buy one. Yes it gets great reception even under the street and when an MP3 player is plugged in it even sounds better I highly recommend the radio."
2,DEWALT DC011R Heavy-Duty Worksite Radio Charger,"I had high hopes for this radio. My brother in Iowa has one and really likes it. I however, live on the mountainous west coast and was surprised at the VERY poor reception of radio stations and loud background static. It has problems receiving stations that I normally receive without problems. Rather than pay for the postage to send it back (as well as reimburse Amazon for the ""Free"" postage to get it to me) I decided to keep it - It'll work in pinch but I'm not happy with it at all."
1,It already broke down!,"I bought this piece of junk in august I actually started using it in september & now it's broken, I own a lot of very good DeWalt tools, but they let me down with this one..."
1,have one,like the old dewalt radio...really wouldn't buy iagain..large and bulky and AA batteries wear out quick on it..tough to preset
5,Great music,"Everything about this music is good--the singing, the poetry of the words, the depth of feeling in each song,the combination of the instruments."
4,Nostalgia,It's good old fashioned European cafe style music. Makes me feel very nostalgic for Europe.
4,"the angel fighting is a little cheesy, but the rest is great","what i understood the intent of this book to be was that lucado wanted to convey the message of the vast love of God. i think he did this exceptionally. the books reads quickly (about 2 hours), and is worth buying for your personal library.I am especially intrigued by how lucado described the Godhead (oneness) -- very accurate!"
5,Awesome picture of spiritual battle,"Although by his own admission largely fictionalized, Lucado delivers another winner of a story. Great for teenagers and up...probably challenging for younger readers because you have to visualize and think beyond what is written (which is not hard, with all the description Lucado provides). I have been focusing lately on spiritual warfare with the Bible study I have been teaching and one of my students gave me this book for Christmas...it is truly a powerful picture of all that goes on between God and Satan that we do not have privilege (thankfully, I think) to see. Even though you know how the story turns out (Christ WAS born, after all) it is still an exciting story that made me think --what IF the vial had been broken? It made me appreciate Christ more and think about God in a deeper way."
5,A Must-Read Christmas story,"A Cosmic Christmas will forever change the way you look at the familiar christmas story. Max Lucado takes you into his imagiation and shows you what it Might have been like at the coming of Christ. A scheming Satan and battling angels will keep you turning the pages as you are engrossed in this spiritual battle between good and evil, life and death.It can be read in less than an hour. In a span of 3 days, I and 3 of my friends had read it and LOVED it. Make a spot for this on your Christmas list."
4,Cosmic Story!,This book tells about all the hardships the angel Gabriel had to go through to deliver Mary the great news and protect them. It is amazing how strongly Gabriel trusted in the Lord. It teaches a good lesson.
5,That's a crock!,"I absolutely love my Kitchen Crock! It is large enough to hold a good amount of kitchen waste, yet small enough not to take up too much space on my kitchen counter; a carbon filter fits nicely in the lid to deal with any odors that might be present; the handle makes it easy to carry to the compost bin when it's full; and it cleans up wonderfully in the dishwasher... all that, AND it looks nice, too!"
5,compost filters that work well at a value price,These filters perfectly fit my compost crock. Each filter laster 1-2 weeks longer than a cat box filter I previously tried for comparison. The price was good; they shipped quickly and were appropriately packaged. I recommend them.
3,my bad,i ordered these to fit my composter and the are too small. all composters or not standard sizes. make sure you order the same diameter as your container or you wife will throw it in your face like mine did
5,Compost filters,The filters fit perfectly on the lid of my compost maker. The filters arrived in the time frame stated on my order.
5,they work! no odor escapes!,"I use the norpro compost crock for used cat litter and cat feces, and the scent does not come out."
3,A Handbook of Material Management in Lean Production,"This book contains a lot of formulas and its origin. Many examples are used to explain the formula in detail. Besides that, there are many study cases in the end of every chapter. This explanation on the formula, its origin, examples and study cases is the streght of this book.The weakness of this book is that it discusses a broad topics, From inventory to forecast, from supply chain to Just In time.This broad topic makes this book has no focus at all.Furthermore, this book doesn't define the definition of ""Lean Production Systems"" well. After I read this book, the question of 'What is a Lean Production Systems' is still not clear.The other weakness is that this book emphasises on the material flow very much. Shortly this book is rather logistic management (in internal company) than manufacturing / process management."
3,THIS IS ACTUALLY AN OK MOVIE!,"A FAMILY ON VACATION GETS CARJACKED AND THEIR CAMCORDER GETS STOLEN. AFTER THAT, THE CAMCORDER IS GIVEN TO A YOUNG TEEN WHO RECORDS HIS DAILY EXPERIENCES IN THE STREETS OF LA. LIKE MUCH OF THE OTHER RECENTLY RELEASED GANGSTA MOVIES, IT IS LOW BUDGETED. HOWEVER, THIS IS A SUPRISINGLY OK MOVIE. THIS MOVIE HAS ENOUGH REALISM AND ENOUGH GOOD SCENES TO MAKE THIS A WATCHABLE MOVIE. ALSO HAS SOME UNINTENDED COMEDY."
2,A low budget knock-off of Menace II Society,"There is nothing special or innovative about this movie. If you've seen Menace II Society or Boyz in the Hood, there is no need to waste your time watching this movie. All the cliches are there...cooking up crack in the kitchen...a gang member gets shot and his homies vow revenge...[junkies]begging for drugs in the street...etc. There is nothing original about the story line, and the poor writing and acting did nothing to keep me engrossed in the film, as was the case with Boyz and Menace. The only thing different about this movie was that it was shot documentary style, but that's been done before. If you have a few bucks to waste and are into [these]... movies, then you might want to give it a look, but don't expect anything special."
2,"Big Deal, Mr. Director","Taking gratuitous advantage of inner city poor seems a cheap shot for a wealthy white man. I have one question for the director: Why don't you make a movie and expose the degenerate aspects of your own people? Exploiting others is no way to make your way in this world. Even though such behavior made your father rich, you should try to be a better man."
3,A Pleasant Little Surprise!,"Very steady-handed directing anchors this low-budget urban indie about a stolen camcorder. Surprisingly well-made and acted; naturalistic performances all around, and not a missed note to be found. Story's really nothing new, just told from a somewhat refreshing angle. I'd say the director achieved what he attempted to do. And he's not too preachy or heavy-handed with the project's anti-gang message -- thus making it quite an effective and unglamorized cinematic little sermon. It gets genuinely intense at times as a result of its ultra-realistic sheen and assured acting, and it's well-paced and never dull, even when character's are unleashed to tell their tales at length. Overall, an enjoyable little movie, well-conceived, executed (no pun intended -- it's graphically violent), and presented. Don't expect much - you too will be presently surprised."
5,"Great story, wonderfully written, downright hilarious...","I hate roaches. Can't stand 'em. They truly do make me sick to my stomach. A new friend, however, promised consistent laughs and great writing when she gave me this novel--and she was right on target. Every morning and evening for week, I laughed out loud on the el during my commute to work. The story is clever, the characters are familiar, and the writing is top notch. The roach-narrator's point of view--whether he's perched on a kitchen cabinet, clinging to the toilet bowl, or generally assessing the past and future realities of mankind--is full of truth and humor. I loved this story, and I loved reading it. (However...I no longer stomp barefoot through my hardwood-floored Wrigleyville - Chicago apartment, and I've taken to keeping cereal, pasta, and crackers in the fridge. You may want to do the same)."
4,you will never look at roaches the same way.,"A very interesting work of fiction. It is the story of a group of roaches that inhabit an apartment in New York City.A new girlfriend has moved in with Ira and cleaned away theirfood supply. This leads our hero, a roach named Numbers, toconcoct a plan to drive away the new, tidy roomate. Numbersand his generation were literally raised in books and have become imprinted on the book in which they were raised, taking onthat book's theme in name and personality. Would have rateda bit higher but it approached ethnic differences in a somewhat stereotypical manner"
3,Good start....,"The book is well-written, and starts off as a novel describing roach society, and roach observation of human society, with an emphasis on the superiority of roach society. The book seems to go off-track as the roach protagonist Numbers develops human desires, even for roach-human sex"
4,great lit and a side splitter at that,"not that great lit has to be boring, though usually is. the metaphor for the human race as a horde of roaches . . . hmmm. great comedy like none i've read in a while. highly recommended.i.e.--roaches caught in roach hotel:""hey, i'm gettin' out of here. the food sticks, it's too crowded, and to top it all off there's roaches all over the place!""indeed."
5,Does this need a review??,It's all of the Harry Potter movies in one slick case..need I say more??? We're HUGE Potter fans and to have all 8 movies in one case is great..good-bye to some on VHS and others on DVD..and hello to a weekend of a Hogwarts Marathon! Great buy!
2,Bad story telling,"I bought this because work had taken me to see 2 of the movies and I wanted to see the series because a lot of people talk about how good it is. Anyone who likes these movies doesn't know a good story. The basic's for every movie is, do some crazy wizard stuff, end up the hospital, have an old wise wizard tell the audience what happened. I'm sorry but if you need a recap at the end of the movie, why did you make me sit through the first 2 hours?"
1,WARNING: DO NOT CONTAIN EXTENDED EDITIONS,"I wish I could give this NO STARS. How careless I was not to read the reviews of this item. When I saw it had almost 5 stars compared to the 1.6 stars for The Wizard's Collection, I purchased it. When we watched the first movie and got to the scene where Hagrid comes to rescue Harry from the island his uncle and aunt take him too we were wondering where the full scene was. We have it on the DVD we bought years ago, but now have Blu Ray. Then we found other extended scenes were missing. As we only bought the first three movies on DVD years ago, we decided to get the Blu Ray set. How disappointing this set is. And I hear The Wizard's Collection is even worse.For us die hard fans who were so hoping for the extended editions and more, there is a petition on the internet. I think you cannot put a direct link into the review so I will break it up. It is at: [...]"
5,Great Collectable pack,"This is a must have collectable set for anyone with Children , many toddlers and children today will not have the benefit of seeing these as they were released , by purchasing the collection you will be able to show the children how Harry and His friends grow through the years and how each story leads into the next"
4,Harry Potter Complete Series,"I had requested the American version when searching for Harry Potter, but received the European version instead. Overall good experience, just not the version I expected."
3,Ok,"Works well but movie 7 part 1 had sound issues the sound didn't match the video, first time I have ever had this problem. Other than that it was great."
3,my box only came with 7 movies,"This is a great box set but my box set didn't include the ""Half Blood Prince"" instead I have 2 copies of ""The deathly hallows part 2"". Needless to say I was a bit disappointed. But the blu ray is good quality as well as the sound."
2,Broken,I was upset to see that when I got the harry potter box set in the mail that the case it was in was broken. When I opened up the package plastic pieces from the case fell onto the floor. I immediately got it ready to return. Maybe if it was packaged better it wouldn't have broken. I hope next time I order it this won't happen again.
3,Craptastic Compilation,"I love the movies - but I hate the product.We've been told time and time again that if we just want to purchase the BD and not worry about special features, that this was the definitive item. But WB dropped the friggin' ball on this one. Big Time.No primary menus; it's a text block.These BD were culled from spare BD single film Special Editions. Most will list the film's name and denote ""Disc One"", when it is the third or fourth movie in the series. This was not a version made for casual fans. This is nothing more than WB redressing their over stock and calling it a new BD boxed set. Way to go, WB. Had you done it right, it'd actually be worth the exuberant price tag, even with Amazon discounts."
1,Harry Potter Limited Numbered Edition REGION FREE,My daughter was THRILLED to receive this for Christmas but was then later crushed to discover that it was NOT region free as advertised. Beautiful box but that was about all we had to go with. Had to return all the way back over the pond. VERY disappointing. Still waiting for refund. Nightmare.
5,magic,what a great box set..the picture quality is great. the box set itself is quite collectible. what a joy to sit down and watch Harry grow up.
3,Harry Potter Box Set,When I first got this I was absolutly pleased with it. Over time when it was brand new there were marks all over the discs. Be very careful who you buy this from!
4,Great Gift,The disks worked perfectly. This is not a collector's type set but if your a HP fan this set is a must
4,Good but not a collectors item,It's a good set but no special packaging to make it special. Once we have blu ray we will get a collectors edition but this will do just fine for now
3,Pretty misleading,I love the series but I also love extras.There was no director commentary and access to the extras is pretty confusing. Another thing is that just because it's on Blu-Ray does NOT mean they are of higher film quality. They are just stored on Blu-Ray discs and not of high definition.
2,Dissapointed,"I was disappointed in this product because when I received it in the mail the plastic casing around the DVD's was completely shattered. When I opened the broken DVD casing all of the disks were loose because the inside of the case was cracked and broken off. There was no bubble wrap or any type of protective material in the thin envelope to prevent this from happening.I had purchased this film collection as a gift, and had to remove the DVD's and put them in individual sleeves. It is unknown to me at this time if any of the DVD's were damaged."
5,these films are a trreasure,these harry potter films are treasured by both my 7 and 9 year old grandchildren. they have read the books and are thrilled to see the beloved stories on screen. they have watched them over and over.
1,Missing a Movie,My copy was missing the film Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. I have no idea what to do about it.
2,complete Harry Potter,movies were in good shape but the case was all broken on three of the sides. I had to buy a new case
1,Potter video's,"Case for movies arrived broken,box was in perfect shape so this item was packed this way,can not believe amazon is allowing this awfull customer service!we will rethink future gift purchases after this."
5,Great Set!,I've seen all the movies and wanted to own the set for myself to watch over and over! The only thing that would have made the set better would be if the movies were individually boxed instead of 8 cds in one box.
5,Great Product,The Harry Potter The Complete 8-Film DVD Collection were in perfect condition! I do not have any complaints at all!
5,amazing movies!,All the Harry Potter movies are stunning to watch! A great deal of work went into the effects which just gor better in each movie! Not recommended for small children but adults will be amazed at the quality of these movies.
2,Arrived broken case...disks were in good shape.,"So upset ... the DVD inside casing arrived broken, disks still played well, so thats all that matters I guess. Otherwise it would have been 5 star. Love HP!"
5,LOVE!,"We love the Harry Potter series! I bought this for my son, but for me too!!:) It arrived when they said."
5,Great deal!,"Perfect way to store our HP collection without having tons of disks around. The price was great too, couldn't beat $30 for an 8 disk set!"
1,Harry Crap,Do not buy this edition! Everyone who said it does not play or plays like crap is correct! WB should be ashamed!
2,The sound is terrible!,"My husband loves Harry Potter, so we purchased this set. We put in the first DVD, excited to see the film, and we could barely distinguish one word from another, even with the sound turned way up. The words are not crisp and clear as they are in most films. We were so very disappointed! And every one of these is the same...we have a relatively new SONY TV, and we can hear other films perfectly, so we don't think the problem lies on this side.If you are thinking of purchasing this set, be aware that the same thing may happen to you."
4,Just as Expected,"I am not going to comment on the movies but will concentrate on the boxed set. If you are looking for the collector's edition this is NOT the item you are looking for. There is another collector's box available that you can get with all the bells and whistles. This box set, however, had what I needed. All the HP movies in blu-ray without any special features, extraneous bonus materials etc. The box that the movies come in is sturdy and the movies are protected well enough in the box. At first the box looked small to contain all the eight movies, but upon opening, they were not only all there but neatly packed into their cover. Overall I would rate this a good product if you are looking for just the movies in blu-ray. The packaging was nice and I got what I needed."
2,Bad packaging,"The movies are fine; but, the case they came in was broken at the swivel point.If the packing had been better, I would have been completely satisfied"
3,Low definition version!,It may be on DVD but the quality of this sucks. Would not have bought it if I had known how poor the picture quality was. Like watching it on youtube where it jumps between 480 and 720 and back.
5,Perfect Collection at Excellent Price!,"All the people who are putting negative comments on this dvd set just because it doesn't have extras are ridiculous. The title says it all: 8 complete films, period. I am VERY satisfied with just the films, that's all I need. And I only paid 39.00 for 8 movies - that's one heck of a deal!I love the case it comes in personally. Stylish, and convenient in the way it stores all the discs. All my discs came with pictures on them (none of them blank), so i'm happy with that. Good quality too.So if you're a Harry Potter fan I recommend this DVD set, for sure."
2,Buy via UK site,"After reading another reviewer I decided to check the Amazon.co.uk site. Better 8 disc box set plus 3 extra bonus material DVDs. Total US Dollar price at checkout $48.16. Pre-order to ship Dec 1st. Can't wait. Might have to pay a conversion fee on the credit card, but still works out cheaper than this price. So it'll be about $6.25 for each BluRay disc! Way cheap!!!! Check it out for yourself before buying."
5,Good Cheap Set,This is a good cheap set for all the Harry Potter movies!! It comes in a hard plastic binder which all of your disc snap into. Some DVD's have graphics but some dont.
5,Perfect Simple Set For The Price!,"Purchased and shipped from Amazon for only $39.99. Only regret I didn't get two at that price. My kids love these movies and that they are all contained in one case. Keeps it neater and all together. Wish I purchased for my other daughter who lives away from home at her own place. Thought I had two in my cart. Next time price drops, I won't hesitate to snatch another one up and send it to her. She saw the set we have and loved it as well. Thanks Amazon for this set! Nothing fancy, but who needs fancy? They only make the fancy sets so they can charge an arm and a leg. Won't buy those. Movies in all one place, easy to get at..Love it! If they drop the price back to $39.99 again, will buy another(:"
5,"Finally a Blu-Ray without any other trailers on startup, immediately just plays the movie","Thanks Warner Brothers for putting together execellent mastering of video and sound of the Harry Potter series and having it so when you load the Blu-ray into your player, it actually goes straight to playing the movie. No trailers or adds on the Blu-ray when loading, no BD-Live loading tralers for you, no having to hit menu or skip or fast forward, it just plays the movie.Also when stopping, at least with our Samsung player, it remembers where it left off and starts playing (just like DVDs), again, no hassles, not setting bookmarks, etc., it remembers where it left off and starts playing.We also have a 5.1 surround system and the sound quality and mixing is excellent.So we are very happy with our purchase and also enjoying watching the movies again at home and at a good price for the set from Amazon."
4,The Title Says it All... so stop complaining.,"The reviews warning against this product due to a lack of special features are completely misguided. The title of this release is ""The 8 Film Collection""; it is not called ""Collector's Edition"" or ""Deluxe Edition"" or ""The Bonus Features Galore Collection"". This is a nice little set for casual fans who simply want all 8 films on blu-ray. And considering this set is (currently) less than $80, how can you complain?Yes, if you're a huge fan of the franchise and want extended cuts and bonus features, save your time and money and wait for a possible future release. But I find it silly that so many reviewers are ""warning"" others not to buy this release because it doesn't have all the bells and whistles.You know what it does have? The films."
2,Save your money and get 3 exstra disks!!!,"Ok so I wanted JUST the Bluerays BUT this is not what you want if you want just bluerays and extras... I have to tell you save your money and get the extras by going to Amazon.co.uk best thing I ever did.. The blueray set has 3 extra disks and it is only 49$ WITH shipping... one more time Amazon.co.uk and enter ""Harry Potter - The Complete 8-Film Collection [Blu-ray] [2011][Region Free]"" save the money and get exstras!"
2,Buy On Amazon UK,"I'm so glad I read the reviews before I bought this set. I have been waiting to get this on blu ray until I had a blu ray player. As I was researching and reading reviews I saw that many people recommended getting this on the Amazon UK site. Boy, were they right. I got this exact set, plus 3 bonus extra footage dvd's for $35.67 USD including the shipping cost. I can't believe the U.S. Amazon site it charging so much for it. The shipping was only $5.00 to sent it to the states from the UK. There are a good deal of blu ray sets on the UK site there are at least half price from what the U.S. site is charging."
3,Missing pieces.,"The first disc was not like the orginal film. While not important in the long run, I would rather have the uncut version. The second disc has also been ""edited"". I wish that the description had included the words, edited or cut."
3,Warning on UK numbered edition set!,"Obviously I have not viewed these movies yet, but I wanted to comment on what one person said about the UK versions. It does look like the basic collection is a better deal than this US collection. But be careful and read the entire description to make sure you are getting what you think you are! I was ready to buy the larger, 19 disc collection which included DVD copies also, but decided to read the description one more time before placing my order. That's when I found out the DVDs in the numbered collection would have been useless to me, because they are coded region 2 (which I assume is not usable here - I don't know the region numbering scheme but I do know we aren't in the same region as the UK). Only the blue rays are usable in the U.S. If ordering for use here, order the basic set since it appears to be the same as the blu ray discs included in the numbered set."
5,Absolutely Remarkable!!!,"While many people complain there supposedly are no special features on these disks, there are loads of them. I have the UK Blu-Ray box set that has 11 discs in it instead of the 8 discs in the US version. All 8 movies have tremendous quality and Bonus Features. The only thing is that he cases are a bit flimsy and that may have a bit better if the cases were a bit stiffer, but otherwise a Fantastic product. I would recommend it to anyone who loves Harry Potter!!!"
5,Mugglicious,This product contained all the movies in widescreen format without bonus discs. That is exactly what we were looking for.
2,The UK Box set is waaaay better...dont buy this!,"The UK box set is available on Amazon.co.uk for ~48 bucks (30 GBP)...and it has all 8 movies + 3 bonus discs...dont buy this one...its a ripoff...Also the UK version is Region Free Bluray. So works out to about 6 bucks a movie...thats cheaper than any other deal out there, especially for such high quality Bluray discs."
5,"Great price, great movies!","What's more to say? These movies are amazing and I am so excited to have this set for my family, especially at such a great price."
5,Bought them for our daughter,She has watched them more than once since Chistmas. She loves them and we do too. The set was a good purchase.
3,Not really for widescreen...,"We have to switch our TV to ""zoom"" in order to fill-up the entire screen. I guess the aspect ratio isn't really for widescreen."
4,Great price for all 8 films,"Just like most of the other reviews noted. This is a great price to get all 8 films but thats all you get. No extra frills or collectables, just the movies for a good price."
4,Great Blu-ray collections of Harry Potter,"The Blu-ray collections include all seven series of Harry Potter movies. In the first 3 disks, it also has Chinese (as well as other languages) caption, which eases our watching. Very good collections to see all Harry Potter's movies."
5,Great Collection of Harry Potter Blu,Pros: Blu-ray and all of the movies in one bundle what else needs to be said. Great collection I have watched over and over again. You would laugh if you knew how old I am. Nice to sink into a fantasy world for a while.The Blu-ray case is simple and fine if you aren't trying to purchase the collector's edition. This edition is very nice if you only want to watch the movies.Cons: Can't think of any at this time.
3,"quality of product, or equipment?","The process of ordering and receiving the collection was very smooth and prompt. Things went south during the viewing of Deathly Hallows, which we viewed first from the set. Several times the screen became very dark, and in some places we had to guess what was happening. We don't know if if is a problem with the quality of the disks, or of our player, but it occurred with one or two of the others, too. It somewhat dampened our enthusiasm and enjoyment of the videos."
4,Great for the price,"Comes in a great case, sturdy and thick. the discs are nicely displayed. Looks great when watched. My problems are that it is wide screen, which you can't tell from looking at the box, and that disc 7 part 1 has no cover art. While the other movies have a picture of Harry/Ron/Hermione, 7 part 1 is totally black and says ""harry potter movie"". I have not seen the actual disc for 7 part 1 and it is definitely possible that it never had a cover art. I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price, but I got this one on sale for $80. Seeing as in my town it can only be found 1-7 part 1 for $140 this was a great deal. Love the series! Overall I have recommended this to many and would continue to do so!"
5,Fantastic Movies,"These movies are fantastic! If you are just looking for a basic set I think it's a good value, since with Amazon's $89.99 price right now, that comes out to only just over $10 for each movie."
5,Worth the money for just the movies.,"It was great that I could purchase all of the HP movies for a very low cost. Don't let all the morons who gave this one star deter you away from buying this set if all you really care about is the movies. If you want special features, spend more money. Simple math and common sense can do wonders, 12 dollars per movie on blu-ray would probably make you think that there won't be special features. So don't listen to the pre-pubescent twelve year olds. If you are looking for just the movies, I would recommend this product."
5,Best Harry Potter Collection we've found so far.,"Very pleased with this UK edition boxed set of all the Harry Potter movies and being fans of the books, it's a nice bonus to have the first movie correctly titled - ""The Philosopher's Stone"".What can I say - it's Blu Ray and the production looks fantastic on our 65"" Plasma! Packaging is fine and relatively compact/space saving, which is nice. I've not fiddled with the 3 bonus discs, but the kids have and they're happy with whatever it all is.Well done..."
5,"All the bells and whistles I was hoping for, none",I don't know about most people but this collection is very simple and to the point. It has every movie in its theatrical release with no extra discs or other content. This product is exactly what I wanted.
4,Good collection,"This is a good collection of all the movies for a great price, although I wouldn't order it from Amazon in this case. It is actually cheaper from the warner brothers website. I payed about $45 for the set. It doesn't have any of the ""extra"" stuff like special features and behind the scenes, but I don't like watching much of that anyways. Over all, it is a very nice set."
4,Great!,"I had read other reviews and some were not very flattering, saying they were ""disappointed"". I will have to say that I am in no way disappointed, it is exactly what I wanted. I wasn't looking for a collectors item, just wanted all the movies together and that is what I got. So if you are looking for a collectors item do not order but if you are just looking for the movies it is a must buy."
3,good collection,"My kids enjoyed this very much. I am not a fan myself, but nothing here to complain about .... it's what it says, the complete 8 film collection, and not much else, which is fine if that's what you are looking for."
5,RSD SF,"This is the perfect gift for the Harry Potter fanatic. The quality of the films are great, and the DVD quality is superior. The price could not be beat and delivery was fast. Overall, my experience is quite favorable and would return again and again.Thank you"
5,Great Movie Set.,Great product. The set is the size of one DVD and includes all theDVDs. Great product at a great price.Harry Potter: The Complete 8-Film Collection
3,Flimsy packaging,"This simple disc collection is just what I wanted, simple with no extra ""stuff"" for big bucks. The only thing that the box is very flimsy, the inside of the box came with broken parts so that dvds don't hold inside very well.."
3,"Good Bundle, Bad Chapter","Got this for my oldest son for Christmas. Everything was great except for one chapter in the Order of the Phoenix. It skipped like crazy, which made no sense seeing as how it had never been out of the case. There weren't any scratches or smudges on the disc, so I'm leaning toward bad encoding on the disc itself. Not too happy about that fact."
5,Perfect!,I got this for my sister's birthday. She loved it and was very surprised. It came rather quick in the mail and in mint quality. I was very pleased with this product!
3,Satisfactory,"The packaging was not the usual box packaging from Amazon,which for me is more secure.Due to that the Bluray casing had some broken parts inside.The Discs are ok not broken only the casing had some small bit broken."
3,Missing Disc,"I was really excited to get this box set because I haven't seen all of the movies. I think I got to the sixth movie before that pesky life thing got in the way. Plus it was a really good price for all eight movies, so I figured I'd spurge for the set. When you open yours though, make sure all the discs are there! I ended up with two copies of the Deathly Hallows Part I instead of getting a copy of The Order of the Phoenix. I don't know what I'm going to do with three Deathly Hallows... Guess I'll just have to become the Master of Death."
1,Harry Potter 8 film set,"My daughter ordered the gift set of all the films for my Christmas present. These are the WORST films I have ever received via Amazon. The last four films in the series are so grainy and so dark, they are impossible to see. She would've been better off ordering all the films separately! I am extremely disappointed with this product. I am also disappointed that poor reviews of this product don't seem to be published on the Amazon website, but they are posted all over the internet in other places!"
2,"Movies are good, but the packaging...","I don't need to talk about the movies. But the packaging was disappointing, to say the least.They didn't even print new labels for the disks! It's like ""Harry Potter and the (whatever), Disk 1"". What do you mean, Disk 1? It's only 1 disk per movie!!So this obviously means they just got all the individual movies that didn't sell, threw the ""Extras"" disk away and put them into this 8-disk package.I bought this because I still have the ""years 1-5"" DVD box, so I just replaced the DVDs with the blu-rays.But this is not the box to buy if you want a ""Complete Film Collection"", despite of what the product name and description says...[]'s"
4,I love Harry Potter!,My only issue is that because this is the first one to come out the later ones will likely have more special features and that is only my theory.
5,Awesome movies,"These rock, I love all the movies, so if you like them, you will like this set! Nothing wrong with them at all!"
5,Love these movies!,"Loved that we own all the Harry Potter movies in one collection now. And, the price was excellent! Can't wait to start our marathon!"
1,Disappointed,"I was so excited to receive this in the mail. It seemed to be such a good value for all the movies. But after I watched the first two movies, I put in the third disk (which was labeled Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and had the picture of the actors on it), and it was actually Polar Express that started playing. As much as I love Polar Express, it's not what I ordered. I wonder if these movies are bootlegged, or if they are just being mass produced too fast and have quality control issues?"
3,"Great box set, if the movies are the right ones...","I purchased this box set with the intention of watching it with my kids when they got a smidge older. It's a year later and we're finally sitting down for a Harry Potter marathon. Imagine our surprise when disc 3, clearly labeled Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azakaban is actually Polar Express. I contacted Amazon and since it's been a while since we ordered the box set there's no desire to assist us with getting the correct disc. We've skipped ahead to disc 4 and so far it's as advertised. We'll see if we get any more mystery movies out of this. My kids weren't thrilled with Polar Express to begin with, so it's a bummer all around."
2,not as expected,"i rated this product with 2 stars because i thought it was a serious collection, and its just a simple box filled with the individual films collected from who knows where. All of them are new, but still, the sixth disc had this written: ""disc 1 movie"".. which obviously meant it was deliberately taken from the individual movie set. im keeping it. but in not satisfied."
4,It says it has Bonus features,"I was wondering why everyone says that this one does not have any bonus features. The image of the back of the case shows that there are bonus features available for each movie, including additional scenes. So, do you mean to say there will another edition with still more bonus features coming up? I for one am thinking of buying this edition, since it might take longer for an ultimate edition to come out, and i am not sure what additional bonus features that might include."
1,Double dipping? I think so...,"What is wrong with this item? Nothing, if you don't know that there are already Blu Ray releases of the films in an extended cut...This means that sometime in the not so distant future, Warner Bros. will release another box set of all Harry Potter movies, this time in their extended, or what is called ""ultimate"" version.If you want high quality product, DO NOT buy this item. Wait for the extended editions. we've seen this before with The Lord of the Rings Blu Ray release, and it managed to create a shout then too."
1,Broken box set,"I was so excited to get this collection and watch them. However, when I opened the dvd case the dvd's fell out. The case was broken before I even received it. Also the dvd's don't fit in the box correctly. I recommend that you don't purchase this item from this user. It kind of ruined my day. You're better off going to a store and saving the hassle of trying to return it or fix the problem yourself."
1,"""Only one can live while the other survives""","DON'T BUY THIS! I love the movies but if you order the UK box set its 20$ less money. The movies are better and have special features and an interview with Daniel Radcliffe and JK Rowling! If you want to buy such incredible films on blu ray buy the UK version the only difference is the first movie is called the Philosephers Stone. If it really bothers you that you have to wait a week and a half get ripped off, its your choice."
5,Your a Wizard Harry,"After ya get through the first film its smooth sailing from their. This is great for a person that doesn't have time to read the books and still wants the message to sink in while having fun! The price is beyond great, ended up being less then $4 per movie for me, what a deal! I've seen them all and I'm re-watching them all with a person that hasen't seen them all and its been enjoyable. Great gift too!"
1,Defective discs,"Discs were found to be defective in that they froze/skipped/returned to previously viewed sections. This occurred in multiple areas. I ordered this collection in hopes the good price was a reflection of the bare-bones presentation. I'm afraid it is probably more a reflection of inferior production sources ie. ""knocked off in a garage somewhere"". In reading reviews of this item ""collection"" problems had been noted as described above ...THEY ARE REAL AND EVIDENTLY ONGOING! I was in hopes Amazon had taken note and action to correct the problem with their suppliers. A call was placed to a live person at Amazon to make them aware of this issue and hopefully get them to effect action when there is a pattern of defectiveness reported as is the case with this item."
3,The wide screen is narrower that most movies we buy and,"and two of the movies are so dark it is almost impossible to see, but the sound is good. Still a good price for the 8 films collection"
4,This was a gift,My mother loved this. She is a big fan and has had most of the individual dvd's. She was thrilled to have a compact collection so she can have more space on her shelves.
5,Harry Potter: Complete 8 Film Collection blu-ray,This product was received in excellent contion and on time. We love the Harry Potter series and wanted all the movies on blu-ray to watch on our HD tv. Would use the seller again.
5,Fantastic Bundle for a Fantastic Price,"When the US version of the Harry Potter 1-8 films came out it was priced at $100.I noticed that the UK version on amazon.co.uk was priced at 40 pounds, which translated to $84 which is a lot better than $100!This itself is the UK version of the films, but it's region-free, which means the disc play in any region, whether your from the UK, USA, Australia, etc.I really love this box set, it has 4 DVD covers, with two movies in each case.Really nicely packaged and a great deal!"
5,"Love,movies, and popcorn",I love having all these great movies in one box. Being able to see our favorite shows are great. We love Harry Potter.
5,Best movie purchase.,I am huge into Harry Potter and scooped this up at a very good price. I get a lot of use out of these DVDs. I just wish there was more books written!
4,bare bones DVD only collection,"If you just want all 8 films on DVD this is great! It's nice and compact packaging. The disks are the exact same as the 1st disks from all the other releases, some disk do have a few features but mainly its just the DVDs.This will hold you over to be able to wait to get the other giant box sets, until WB figures out that they actually want to give us all the bonus features."
5,Simple Box Set,"If you are looking for a SIMPLE Harry Potter Box Set, with all the movies then this is for you! It is cheap and has everything you need in a small box, easy to bring from place to place (for those Harry Potter marathon parties).This is not a box set filled with special features and all those bells and whistles. If you are looking for that, I recommend you look elsewhere. This is exactly what I myself wanted, as I can never justify spending tons of money for all those special features that I won't even watch, however there are many who like that sort of thing. Make sure which kind of fan you are buying for if you plan on this being a gift to someone."
1,Not a set,"This is a great price for a nice, bare bones collection of movies, which is perfectly fine by me. What is not fine by me is the fact that some of these movies were wide screen and some were full screen. A few had auto-play while others had previews. I don't mind if they're simply reprints of the original releases, but they could have at least been consistent with the products they reprinted. I am the kind of person who has to have wide screen, and wants things within a set to have the same basic functions (especially when advertised as such); please bear this in mind as you take in this information.Also, the set that I received had five damaged discs; no physical damage or dust on the discs themselves, but they would not play past ten minutes into the movie, and some could not access secondary menus. This grievance is specific to the set I received, but buyer beware.I will be returning this item and waiting for the next (likely more expensive, sadly) release of a Harry Potter boxed set."
5,I love having them all!,i decided to wait ill i got all of my harry potter movies i knew so many were coming out when they started. i ended up with a blu-ray player and i got this entire box set for less than 80$ i can't complain!
5,worth every penny,"If you only want the BluRay movies you cant go wrong with this. When I bought mine there was a better deal for more extra content on the UK version, but it was a preorder. I like that this box set contains all 8 movies in one case the size of two normal cases. It is not 8 individual slim cases. This works well for me because I dislike the slim cases but am running out of room on my bookshelf.Again if you do not care about all the special feature discs and just want to watch the Movies you cant go wrong with this set; especially at the sale price."
4,Great basic collection,"This is a great value for getting a basic collection of all the movies. They are just the moves, no extras, which is all I wanted. All but the last three start playing without ads or menus."
4,Good product for a reasonable price,"Exactly what I wanted: a complete set of all the Harry Potter movies. Very good quality too, and was shipped on time (just like every Amazon item I ordered)."
4,Great movie,I have been waiting for this complete collection for some time now. It is great to finally get my hands on it.
5,Harry Potter - DVD series,Arrived in plenty of time for Christmas - in good shape - thx for quick service - will order again easily
3,Average quality dvd,"I was disappointed with the quality of the set, Especially the 8th film. I had to return and get a replacement set because of the poor quality of the 8th and final movie. The rest of the collection was ok, but I noticed that some scenes were deleted on the movies. I love the Harry Potter movies as much as the books, but the company definitely did not care about the qualityof the product they are putting out, knowing that people will still buy them. I also bought the bluray set, but have not had the chance to view it. I hope it is much better than the dvd set."
3,Harry Potter Blue ray set,"The set arrived intime. When i play the movie on my LG Blue ray player, the movie pauses ,buffers and plays which is irritating."
4,Harry Potter 8 Film collection. No extras,"This 8 film collection is great! I got this for my 13 year old daughter who loves the movies and has read all the books as well. She was very excited to get this for Xmas. I paid only $39.99(DVD only) for it on a Cyber Monday special, so the price couldn't have been better. I knew that this was just a base 8 film collection with no extras when I purchased it. If you are just looking for the entire Harry Potter series with no extras, this is by far the best deal going. It arrived on time with absolutely no damage. Amazon is great and I thank you once again.Harry Potter: The Complete 8 Film Collection [Blu-ray]"
5,Excellent Price,"I had been watching this collection for a few days and they had it at $49.99, but saw it on Thanksgiving Day for $39.99, I had to buy it. For all 8 movies this was a steal. Sure it doesn't have a fancy box and an included cape and wand but do I really need that stuff if they were to offer it in a box set.Rumor has it they are going to lock the series away and bring it back out in like 10 years or so similar to what Disney does.Otherwise, excellent transaction."
5,Harry Potter Blu-ray collection,"I have to say I am THRILLED to now own the complete set of Harry Potter movies in Blu-ray! Maybe even more thrilling is having a UK version boxed set. ""The Philosopher's Stone"" is the title I much prefer for the first book/movie. I am completely satisfied with the processing and timely delivery from this seller!"
5,All 8 HP Movies on DVD,"Love that they are all widescreen and love that they are all in one case, makes travel easier since my son watched them in the car too!"
4,just what we wanted,"My kids wanted to watch these movies, but I didn't want to pay for them individually. This set is exactly what we needed at a great price for the set. There are no special features, extra scenes, etc.... so if that is what you're looking for, you may want to look elsewhere. But if you just want all the movies at a reasonable price, this is perfect. We would have rated it five stars if the case were a little better, the plastic that hold the movies inside keeps falling out. But this is a minor annoyance."
5,Easy to store the collection,Fabulous movies and in a compact case for storage. I highly recommend the set for any Harry Potter fan. Thumbs up
5,Yay!,It shipped exactly when they said it would and I haven't stopped watching it since. The film quality is fantastic!!!
5,Great value,"I absolutely loved that I could get all the movies for a great discount. I was able to buy this set while it was on sale, so it figured out to be like $5 a movie....I had originally bought all of the movies as they came out, but in a recent move I lost all of them. So this was a great way to replace my set in a cost efficient manner."
2,No subtitles,"I hate that dvd version doesnt have subtitles in any language, so I has dissopointed that only came in English-"
1,Be patient.,"These videos are the watered-down generic versions. Fans of the series likely have these already, and if not, a little looking can net you all 8 of these for a slightly cheaper price. Much like the Lord of the Rings extended version, the upcoming Harry Potter Complete extended edition will not only pack in a few scenes that were cut from the movies in the interest of time, but are purported to add cohesion to the films, and a slightly more depth the the characters. Either way, you can save money by purchasing the discs separately, or wait a bit a get the upcoming extended version. (I recommend the latter.)"
2,Well I do not get this hole thing !!!!!,"Why would so many people get so worked up about a Bunch of Kids Flying around on Broom sticks !!! It was ok But no better or worse than any other child movie.....But just like that Dumb Van-pier movie the Twilight Saga I think it;s all pretty dumb and I do not get why so many go crazy over a kid with a Magic Wand and riding broom sticks..Maybe for a kid, it would be ok, but really, what is wrong with you people,,,,no wonder this world is so messed up with people, liking the movie that is so dumb, but owe'well to each his own...."
3,You want it? Fine. I don't,"I own all the movies as individual sets. I would like to own a special edition box set with all 8 films. However, until they make it truelly SPECIAL EDITION with someting new to add to the original individual sets, I don't want this set because the original indivdual sets have more to offer.If you only care about the theatrical film versions, okay the buy it. I gave it a 3 instead of 1 because I'm sure its a great set for those who only care about the individual theatrical versions. But as for me I'm fine without it until it has some serious improvements."
1,SOO expensive!,"This review or rating is NOT for the quality of the films, it's for the quality of this boxset!Well, converting the currency into pounds, it comes to approx 62, which is very much overpriced!With the UK edition, not only is it 30, yes 30 cheaper, but you also get 3 bonus discs for the last 3 movies! i'm speechless into how expensive it is...."
1,False advertising!,Picture showed completely different Item than what i got!!! I ordered the American Version and got sent the British. I looked this item over up and down before ordering. Never trusting this seller again!
1,I'll patiently WAIT...,"Sigh, just like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I too shall wait patiently for the ultimate Blu-Ray release of the entire movie set. sigh.. such a shame WB is going this route."
1,I'm Waiting,No bonuses or anything. I'm waiting for a proper box set. It's not cool when they release a movie series set without everything extra that each individual release had. I hope most people hold off on buying this.
1,unfair,I think it's really unfortunate that Warner Brothers is releasing such a poor box set. After all these years it would be nice to have the extended editions all in one place!
3,Great movies,The 5th DVD skips and even hits a point where it stops completely. The other movies however play just fine.
3,Defective Packaging,The hinge structure for the DVD sleeves arrived with some of the hinge pins broken. The sleeved discs do not sit properly in the binder.
3,BEWARE!!!!,"The first time I ordered this I received the 8 film collection except the DVD that was supposed to be ""The Prisoner of Azakaban"" and so labeled was actually a completely different movie when I put the DVD in to play it. I was actually the Polar Express. So, I contacted Amazon, then sent me out a new collection and it had the same problem!!!"
3,good but not great,shipping was quick but DVD condition wasn't great...two of the DVDs in the set had scratches that made the movies unreadable for a seen or two.
4,my little brother loved it,I got this as a gift for my little brother. he loved the whole set. Some of the earlier movies are damaged and cant be played so he was really excited to get this. Great idea
5,Harry Potter Dvd Collection 1-8,Bought the full collection so we would have copy for our houhold when my daughter moves out so we still have a set.
5,Exactly what we wanted,"Before buying this 8 disc blu-ray set of Harry Potter, I saw reviews that indicated it did not include extra information. I bought the set anyway, since we don't really care about extra cuts, etc. However, after browsing around, we found plenty of extra information including interviews and cuts. We are happy with the set - we got exactly what we wanted, which is a complete set of HP on blu-ray discs. We also got some extras that we had not counted on. So, all is well."
5,Perfect,"No extra features, but it has all the movies in a nice compact movie box, they played and looked great. It was exactly what I wanted at a price that made me happy too. :) Enjoy!"
5,Love!,"I love the Harry Potter series. It is a magical adventure having all the DVD's. I couldn't afford the fancy expensive collection, but am very happy with this. The movies on blu-ray are awesome!"
4,I finally Watched Harry Potter,"For years my family has read the books and watched the movies while I have shunned the series altogether. I finally decided to purchase the box set and while yes, it doesn't seem to have a bunch of special features it does have all the movies which is what I cared about anyway as I am not a Harry Potter fanboy. My boyfriend and I watched it over a 6 week period and we actually really enjoyed the films. I'm thinking about having another Harry Potter weekend when the next 3 day weekend rolls around."
1,This is it?,After seeing what the box set was going to look like for the french version a month or two ago I was really excited! I mean it has a sleek black box and comes with the elder wand! I could not wait to see what kind of box set we were going to get here in the u.s. as well as the u.k. Needless to say I was utterly dissappointed. I feel like so much more could have been done with this box set rather than just put them all together in one set and call it a day.I will more than likely buy the seventh and final film on blu ray seperately and hope something better comes along for the box set.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SET!!!,"I just received my set of blu-rays and the first movie is not even the correct title! It says ""Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone"" instead of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" Needless to say I am going to try to return the set, however it is from an outside seller but fulfilled by Amazon...Mike Malin from Lexington , KY. I didn't realize this when I purchased the set and am very upset with this and not even sure if it can be returned. Wait for the official release set, this is a cheap knock-off!"
4,Pony Express,"This is the first Christmas present that I ordered, and it still hasn't arrived. Everything that I ordered later is already here."
2,"All discs at once, but no love at all.","If you like to have all BluRay just in a single tiny box, this is for you.No booklet, no extras, nothing. One disc has even the printing from a previous multi disc package.Compared to the Star Wars collection with 9 discs, this feels very cheap and without love.No complains on my side, I have been warned here... which doesn't means that it becomes a good rating."
5,Harry potter 8 film box set,"It came nicely packaged, included all 8 films in one unit, a lot of the box sets are using regular DVD cases I like the one they used for this box set. The quality was very good for DVDs although there is a blueray version of this available too if you want very high quality.I'm not supposed to rate the film but if I was I would be taking a star away. This was the first time I had seen the ending and was very disappointed. It felt rushed and not well made. But because I'm not rating the actual video on the disks I still give it 5 stars."
4,Good Bargain,"This DVD set is a good bargain for all the movies combined into one package. It's not HD, but for the price you can't go wrong."
4,good,Great reception by those who received this on Christmas morning. None have given me feedback yet from playing them but I know they are happy with the gift. Am going to find a copy for myself in the near future.J. Robert Ewbank
5,Very satisfied with the quality and value of this set,This was a really good deal for all 8 Harry Potter movies. The set does not include the extra discs that came with the earlier movies but that's OK. I bought this collection to watch the movies not the extras. We have not been disappointed with the quality of the DVDs. The price was excellent for the entire collection.
2,Missing Scenes,"I received this set as a gift this past Christmas. Upon watching, I became aware that some scenes from the original movies were missing; a few from each disc. I'm pretty disappointed with the quality."
3,Prisoner of Azkaban defect,"All of the movies were in excellent shape with no damage to them. However, the Prisoner of Azkaban dvd is not playing correctly. The picture fades in and out during the movie, but not on the title screen. This is the 3 Prisoner of Azkaban dvd I have had this issue with. There is definitely a manufacturer defect. Anyone else have an issue with any Prisoner of Azkaban dvd?"
4,It works,"It is nice to have all of the Harry Potter movies in one case. The case is made a bit cheaply, comes apart, not easy to close always, but it works."
2,Amazon movies,I received the Harry Potter Set in decent time. However upon trying to view the movies only 4 of 8 of the DVD's work in my computer. As I live over seas it is not convenient for me to return the set to get a replacement.
4,Harry Potter Complete 8 Movie Set,Have watched the first two so far. I'd never read the books or seen any of the movies yet. Very entertaining.
2,Titles misinterpreted,"I had passed up another less expensive 8-disc boxed set (the UK version) because the title of the first film was ""The Philosopher's Stone"" (as opposed to the US version ""Sorcerer's Stone""). So I paid slightly more since this description stated ""The Sorcerer's Stone"". Then when it showed up at my door, it was the UK version instead of the US version.I know it's a small thing, and the films work great and all that, but it was the single selling point why I went with this set versus another, and then it turned out to be inaccurate."
5,A feast,"I had seen these movies over the years, but you forget how much the characters change as they age. A long weekend snowed in was a perfect opportunity for a marathon. What great storytelling - although the effects in the older movies are already beginning to feel old. How we are spoilt."
3,Not what I expected,"First, I've never read a Harry Potter book nor seen it's first film. I ordered this based on all the glowing Harry Potter reviews here and elsewhere on the off-chance that I might like them as well as I liked Tolkein's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy or even the ""Wallace & Grommit"" complete collection. This was a far cry from Tolkien's exceptional fantasy (10 stars) both in book & film for me. The story line just did not keep my attention nor did I care much for the cinematography and effects rendered. I will probably give it away to a much younger child in my neighborhood that will be entertained by it more than I."
5,Potter,I love it that I have all 8 movies especially in blu ray. I am still watching them. Great adaptation to the book.
3,Just the Movies,I bought the entire set from Best Buy because i didnt want to wait the 2 days for shipping and wanted to watch it right away. Well I had read the reviews that the bonus features were very limited but i was still amazed by the laziness of warner brothers in that the collection is literally just the first disc from each blu ray set. The sixth movie even says straight up disc 1- movie. Now although i do understand costs and such i feel like they could have at least gone 1 extra step and printed a different label for each and possibly matched up some menus to make it seem like the movies should all be together. hopefully they do a better job when they come out with the big collectors edition at the end of the year.
3,Sync Problem,"I already owned the DVD's for most of the movies and wanted a little better picture quality. I think they delivered on this with improvements throughout the series although the later films are much better than the first two. My problem is the sound in disc 7, Deathly Hallows pt. 1, keeps going out of sync with the picture. I can pause rewind forward and then play to get it back on track but it happens repeatedly making the experience very poor."
4,Great for the price,"I took some other people's advice and ordered this through amazon.co.uk - for a lot less then its selling in the states. It takes longer to get here...I think it took over two weeks and to be honest I was starting to worry. But it came today so all is well. I hear a better box set is coming out. This doesn't surprise me. Something better is always coming out. For what is out right now, this is great. By buying from UK - you save money and get the complete set. Pretty good deal."
4,mousehouse 67,"I choose blu ray format because it has such great graphics. The picture was very crisp, clean.I was very happy when all 7 movies came out together and buying them in the box set saved money and space. Very happy with my purchase."
2,Set is fine...company is shady,"when my product arrived, I was given the British version of the series instead of the American one shown, and a letter telling me how much better this version was. So I researched it to find that the British version is 10 to 15 dollars cheaper. In the letter I mentioned earlier, he offered a ten dollar gift card that he conveniently didn't send. It was shady and a hassle and you should do what you say you will. Will avoid this seller at all costs. Product is great."
5,great!,This DVD set is compact and of great quality. It is absolutely perfect for Harry Potter fans! Arrived ahead of schedule which is always nice.
5,Wow,Who wouldn't love all of the Harry Potter movies on dvd for such a great price! Box set of all of the movies for my sister. She loves them! After all who doesn't need a Potter movie marathon?!
5,10!,If you're a Harry Potter movie fan and like the 'collect them all' concept this is perfect. My son loves them.
5,Review - Harry Potter: The Complete 8-Film Collection,Great buy for any age if you are looking for a great gift this is it or just for your self.
2,Audio cuts out,I have a brand new Blue ray player and my player plays other BR discs fine. The audio on this set cut out 19 times on the first disc. I sent is back for a refund. I really wish this worked. You can't watch a thrilling movie with the audio cutting out.
2,A little frustrating,"I have been researching on Amazon for the whole dvd collection of Harry Potter since beginning of November.The problem with my purchase is that I got an ad in my mail box about the a retail in this collection. I bought it, without paying attention that it was a regular dvd, not a blueray one.Even though the delivery was done properly and in time for Xmas, I got frustrated because I already have the regular dvds and I was really interested in a blue-ray collection.bummer."
3,Great movies,The disks were great but the packaging not so much. THe case was broken when recieved but the movies are in good shape and play well. Great pictures.
1,Something's missing,"I received these for Christmas and noticed as I watched the first movie that some scenes have been deleted. The letters don't appear in the eggs and Hermione doesn't answer Snape's questions to Harry in their first potions class. Unfortunately, you can't return an opened DVD...."
5,Excellent present,"I bought this Blue Ray set as a Christmas present for my daughter. She loved it, therefore so do I!"
1,Ripped off in North America,"Ok - so the Region 1 set is over 70 USD but if you order the Region 2 set it is only 32 USD (s&h; brings it up to 40 USD)!Come on Amazon. What is the deal?Def. makes me want to go out and buy an ""all regions"" DVD or Blue Ray player.While I do not plan on buying either Region 1 or Region 2 set I am posting this to notify Amazon customers that they are ripping off folks for the Region 1 set."
1,Dear WB:,"Dear WB:I hope you are reading these comments. I will not buy this first output of all HP movies for two reasons: 1) very expensive for what I already own, 2) I want to sit with my adult daughters and glory over all things HP that they grew up with and that we enjoyed together. I will wait, or maybe not buy at all and look for something on eBay."
3,Srsly?,"EDIT: This review was edited after seeing and reviewing the extremely overchargedHarry Potter Wizard's Collection (Blu-ray / DVD Combo + UltraViolet Digital Copy)First of all, let me say I am a huge Harry Potter fan and was looking forward to a complete box set of the extended edition blurays. This is not that collection.To be fair, the movies themselves all warrant 5-stars. This package is nice for fans who just want the regular movies and don't care about all the extras. But most diehard fans want more than that... the additional scenes, the deleted material. Give us Hogwarts the way it was meant to be!!I am altering my rating to three-stars because I see the need for this collection, but would still like an extended version. To me, this product is still incomplete and I cannot recommend it for true fans.Please put the magic back into Harry Potter... =("
1,VHS VERSION?!?!?!,"Ok, i find it stupid and asinine that they only release this product for BR (bleu-raes) and DVD (direct video demand), but NOT for VHS (video home system)!!!!!!!!! year after year i see less and less films available for VHS! this sucks! my collection is completely ruined if i conform and start buying BR or DVDs--the cases are too skinny and look RETARDED next to my good old VHS discs! PLEASE release this one on VHS! i just LOVE Hairy Potter and want it soo bad on home media!"
1,Where's the beef?,"I totally agree with the current opinion thread!!! If WB wanted to do this right, they would release the set in 3D !!"
3,Small print,"Just watching the Sorcerers Stone, enjoyable except i missed the widescreen product description prior to purchase. Not my favourite format, even at half price i probably would have not ordered the set as a result."
5,I don't get the hype,"I don't understand the whole Harry Potter hype that has hit the nation and would never buy this product for myself let alone pay to see anyof these movies. That being said, my wife loved the complete package so I must have done right. Yea me!!!"
5,Harry Potter 8 Film Collection for Bluray,Received my purchase quickly. The price was excellent. Quality of discs were great. Haven't had a problem yet when buying from Amazon.
2,Disappointment,"I love the harry potter movies. Unfortunately this film collection is very disappointing. Warner Bros just packaged the movie discs from the original releases of the blurays in one box. They should have either included all the special feature discs or made new discs for the collection. I understand that Warner Bros wants to make as much money as possible, but this is pathetic."
4,Great Set,"I Grew Up With The Harry Potter Movies, and i saw all the films in cinema (Except the first one)so i was very excited to own all the films in one dvd setThis Set Is very goodIt has All the 8 flms presented in widescreen and 5.1 dolby digital audioAll the films are in great shapethis is a great set to own for every harry potter fan."
5,Extraordinary Value for Harry Potter Fans,"All 8 Harry Potter movies on DVDs at a total all inclusive price of under $50 translates into just over $6 per movie. For Potter fans, this is the way to go!"
5,Harry Potter collection,Excellent deal. Fast Shipping. Could not find a better deal locally. This will keep the kids out of our hair so we can recover Christmas morning.
5,Great purchase!,"Love, love, love, these movies! Great price and great order experience. Couldn't ask for better! Thanks Amazon! I will always order from here. :)"
3,Buy from amazon.co.uk,"I have read alot of comments, google'd the sets and still went with the harry potter blu-ray set found amazon.co.uk do a search for harry potter 1-8you should see it.ok so i get the set a couple days later but I only paid 48$ for 11 blu-ray discs (8 movie discs and 3 additional discs).ok so they are region free but they are region free which means they have nothing added to them to prevent you from watching in almost any blu-ray player (yes works fine in ps3 also).bottom line you get more Harry Potter for half the price which in my book is ok. Also these discs will be same ones in the US versions minus the region crap incase you read some detail you liked on the US version being released for 97$. Save the extra 49$ for the Ultimate Ultimate Ultimate Edition Complete set ""with all the extra footage we have"" - till we find some more and release it again."
1,dont buy,"I purchased this set not caring on what the package would look like, as long as the dvds would play as good as the store-bought. They are not that good, the quality is really bad. Some are really blurry, they look really bad that its like if they were cheaply copied or illegally reproduced. Now I understand why the cost is so low. I recomend that you dont buy this. I am not even a fan and the quality made me not even want to see it...DO NOT BUY."
2,Disappointed with discs,"I had pre-ordered this set and was very much looking forward to the Blu-ray discs. When I opened the set and flipped through the discs, it seemed as if this set was just put together with other blu ray discs from other packaging. The discs look nothing like the pics on the order site. Order of the Phoenix even says DISC 1 and DH part one cover looks like it was bought off the street... not what I expected."
5,AMAZING,"I love this package! Totally worth the money, and the first few movies look amazing on Blu-ray! definitely worth it!"
1,Doesn't work,It came in pretty quick but was not worth it! Didn't work and it kept falling off my blow dryer!
3,eh....,"It sort of works? I had to tie a rubber band around my blow dryer to get it to stay on (and I have a large blow dryer) it seemed to work, I don't know. It also takes FOREVER to blow dry your hair with this. Without the sock, it takes about 5 minutes. With the sock on, it takes about 30!!"
4,air sock,Product shipped quickly and seems to work just fine! I don't use it a lot but when i have it seems to work as well as the one my hair person uses.
4,good product,"Its good for travel as it is weightless.Its only fault is that it doesn't have the prongs on a conventional diffuser, but with a little more effort and scrunching the hair with your fingers you can achieve the same result"
5,Perfect for curly hair and travel,"I have owned one of these for several years now and recently purchased a few more to give to my curly haired friends. This product is awesome! It is light weight, collapses down to take up zero space in luggage, fits on every blowdryer and works as advertised. I have used it with multiple hotel blowdryers with great success. (At times I used a hair band to secure the hot sock to the dryer- I made sure it was just tight enough to stay on but still left room for air flow). I have also used this at home when I didn't feel like pulling out my large diffuser."
3,works fine...,"I purchased this because most ""universal"" diffusers aren't since my dryer is not round. This could use a tighter elastic or something less 'smooth' on the end because it slips off my hair dryer too easily ... but it works."
4,My favorite!,"I have used this for years to dry my short naturally curly, but not coarse or fizzy hair. It is light weight and packs easily for travel and can be slipped over the nozzle of any drier. It does develop holes after about a year of daily use, but it is inexpensive. I used the hard plastic diffusers previously and would never go back to the."
5,The only diffuser to own,"I have had a hot sock for almost 20 years. I lost my last sock when I moved. I never purchased any other diffuser before, but I have tried a few standard, plastic, made-to-fit-one-hair-dryer-only diffusers when I purchased new hair dryers. I found they made the dryer heavier and more awkward to use as they always extend the length of the dryer. I have somewhat short arms and other diffusers would not allow me to keep the dryer far enough away from my hair to angle the unit properly for drying. I discovered the hot sock at my beauty salon and have never been impressed by any others. Not only is it very light but it also fits every hair dryer I have tried it on and is very easy to travel with. The hot sock also works as well, if not better, than other diffusers and costs less too."
4,Easy to Use - Good for Travel,"I've used the heavy plastic diffusers but this one works just as well, maybe better. It's also crushable, so I can pack it in my suitcase along with my hair blower without using up more space. It does a pretty good job of allowing heat without significant air pressure to gently dry curly or fine hair without burning or flattening it. Sure, Fashion Ave. says straight is in, but I like my curls and this diffuser keeps them plump and happy. I say Be Yourself."
5,Tries and true,"This diffuser is simple and excellent. This is the second one I have used, the first lasted for around 8 years. Once the original could not be used anymore, I tried drying my hair without a diffuser with poor results. The hot sock arrived very quickly and has helped make my hair less frizzy."
2,diffuser,Hot Sock Diffuser does not stay on hair dryer. flies off even at low speed. Hard to hold on and dry hair at the same time.
2,Not impressed,"I have annoying curly hair, was very excited about trying this option to help dry my hair with less frizz. Tried it once, and sighed disappointed at the end...it now sits in my drawer and do not see any reason to use again. Maybe for traveling.The joys of curly hair, always trying new products."
1,Great Product/site unreliable.,"I already own one of these and it works great for short or curly hair. Thought I'd buy another for the gym, ordered two weeks ago, still not here. Find someplace else to purchase this item. NOT from Wasatch Beauty."
1,"Wanted to love it, but makes my hair insanely frizzy","I have thin, naturally wavy hair that luckily never gets frizzy. I use a diffuser to help create more curl, and was looking for something lightweight to take when I travel. Unfortunately this sock diffuser made my hair an absolute frizzball. Nothing has ever made my hair look like this (or this bad)- not even the extreme humidity of Mexico in August. Not recommended."
1,Hot sock is all I got!,"I'm not sure what all the rave reviews were for, because I missed the fascination of this diffuser sock! All it is is a ""sock"" of sorts made of some funky fabric that fits over your hairdryer nozzle. Really? I wish I would of thought of this bogus product first! Do yourself a favor and buy a REAL diffuser!"
3,Works pretty good,"With a short barrel dryer you may have to hold the diffuser on with a finger, but it wasn't too hard to do this, and the air flow was good."
5,You'll like this one.,"This follows the characters from Stern's first book through yet another adventure. The style is ala Tom Clancy which to me is a good thing. If you're looking for a good way to spend some time away from the world, curl up with this baby. But beware, you won't want to put it down once it gets going. There's action, likeable sexy characters, intrigue and the sort of conspiracy theory stuff that you sort of suspect might exist in the real world, but we'll never know about. There's even a well researched peak into the day to day Vatican. What's not to like?"
4,Buy It Now,"""Edgar, the prince of darkness is a Gentleman.""This apt chapter epigraph from Shakespeare, and all the others just as good, tony up Vatican Gold, an action movie of a book, like Bacall boosting Chandler.Vatican Gold is Tom Stern's second novel on the ineffable mineral and the infernal behavior it succors. I enjoyed its edgy idealism - it's all about friendship after all - combined with a chilling mastery of nasty minds.The reader is paced to the last page by violent self-reflection ""....like a gladiator plowing forward despite fatal injury,"" the author's words describing the flight path of an airliner minus tail assembly.Vatican Gold. I say buy it now."
1,Awful!,"Bought this despite the negative reviews. Boy, did I make a big mistake. I hadn't even had the clock for 5 hours yet and it quit telling time. Just stuck at 7:51pm on December 26th. What a piece of garbage!"
1,Failed after a little over a year,"In general, this was a poor quality device. I did like the multiple alarms (7/5/2) and it was easy to set, but the code for DST was out of date which meant that the device had to be reset 4 times a year instead of correcting itself automatically. The sound quality was rather poor (I wouldn't use this to play music from my phone/mp3 player/whatever. If that is a feature that you find attractive, search elsewhere. The device failed in a rather bizarre and irritating way. It was unable to draw power properly, causing the time to blink off an on alternately and it started emitting clicking noises occasionally (of course this failure occurred in the middle of the night, ruining a good night's sleep)."
2,Alarm Clock Radio--Difficult to program,"Several weeks ago I purchased the Timex T435B MP3/CD Line-In 8-Color Clock Radio. Please note that the product name is misleading because you CANNOT play CD's on this! I opened the package to find that it only has an MP3 player hookup. Furthermore, it is extremely difficult to program because it has so many functions. While the price was right, the purchase was not."
1,Not Happy,"This picture is deceiving, i know that im am suppose to read the specifications but so metimes people look over things. I thought this was a iPod compatible product when i purchased it come to find out that it is just a mp3 outlet. who wants a iPod holder for a radio which everyone is converting into iPod Touch. Not Happy"
1,Don't Purchase!,"Do Not purchase, do not be fooled by its colorfulness and its features. Within a few months, due to a power outage, the color changing display feature did not work. Also nowadays it still works, however the time resets itself due to the fact that its set on the old daylight savings time. Also this may seem kind of dangerous but sometimes when I go to shut off the clock I static shock it, and that then resets the time...which reminds me I have to go change that right now. :/ am currently in the midst of looking for a new and safer clock."
1,Not what it was supposed to be.,"I specifically was looking for an alarm clock radio with dock for ipod. Unless the definition of dock is :A place to set down ipod but not actually use it. . . I got jipped, nothing like paying 30 dollars for a piece of crap alarm clock with a little spot to set my ipod."
2,cant read the time!,"My mom bought this clock for me as a housewarming. It has some great features (you can set it to wake you only M-F, etc) but the main thing this is--is a clock. And I cant actually read the time on it! It's too light to be visible. Supposedly you can change the brightness and colors of the clock face but even putting it up to the brightest I still couldnt read the time. It burned out after a few months of use. On the bright side the alarm still works so I use it as an alarm and have another clock in my bedroom to see what time it is. Dont buy this! It's a clock and is supposed to tell time!"
1,disappointed,"I was very excited for the first two days I had this clock. My Mp3 player which is old and of a non famous brand worked with the docking attachment.However, the power on this machine just died on me on day three. It only works with batteries now. With batteries the display is so light that you can hardly see it. I threw out the packing otherwise this would have been shipped back to amazon."
1,Terrible! Do not buy!,"I bought this clock because of the line in jack for my mp3 player. Well, that works fine but the clock doesn't. After about 3 months of use, the screen went dark and I can no longer read the time unless I am 1 inch from the clock.I thought maybe I had a faulty one, but after searching the net, I found many other complaints about the same problem.Poorly made product. Not worth the money if you want a lasting product."
2,Poor display,"The biggest problem with this alarm clock is that you can't read the display unless your are standing nearby and looking down at it. This is due to the angle of the front of the alarm clock and the fact that the display has the ability to change colors. The fact that it can change colors is neat, but rather impractical if you can't read the time from across the room."
3,Timex Dual Alarm Clock Radio,"1 The day light time feature needs improving.The day light time feature makes the alarm clock undependable.2 The date, day, DST, and time feature is excellent.3 The MP3 player optional input is excellent.I use the clock radio to listen to my MP3 plsyer and for the date, day, DST, and time."
3,a bargain at 19.99,"this clock has functioned fine for me, i bought it at a local store and felt like it deserved a decent review, the buzzer is quiet, but buzzers never wake me up anyways. I recommend if you're a deep sleeper use a radio at max volume, the aux input makes this thing a steal at 19.99!"
2,Good for light sleepers,"This is a nice clock for the office, but I don't depend on it to wake me up. I chose this clock because of the dual alarms and iPod connection. The buzzer alarm is not very loud and turns off automatically when the radio alarm goes off. The radio is not good - very bad reception that fades in and out without moving the dial or antenna wire. I'm going to find a better alarm clock and take this to the office as a desk clock & iPod speaker. The good features: dimmer for the display, 2,5, 7 day alarms, automatically updates with Daylight Savings change and you can adjust the volume for the sleep setting without changing the alarm volume."
1,Unreadable clock face makes for a bad time,"I recently purchased this Timex clock radio because of it's dual-alarm and MP3 hook-up capability. The alarms are way to soft and I slept through them twice (and I am not a heavy sleeper). However, the worst part was that I was unable to read the clock face unless standing above it at an odd angle. The lighted digital display of time did not contrast with the background enough to distinguish unique characters. The clock constantly looks like it reads 18:88 instead of the correct time. Changing the soft display colors did not help. After two days of having no clue what the correct time was, I returned it for a full refund."
2,Resets itself,"I've had this alarm clock for a year and a half, so that's pretty good because many others have said that within only a few days the alarm clock will completely reset itself as if the power went out. This is what happened to me a few days ago. I thought the power went out because the date and time were wrong, so I went to set the clock to the right date and time and as soon as I did, the clock completely reset itself on its own again. I'm glad it hasn't done this when I had to wake up for class or work, I guess I'm lucky. But don't buy this if you want a reliable clock that lasts."
2,not what i thought,"i thought that this device would be able to charge my mp3 player, but it doesnt. radio is cool though, but my main purpose for purchasing this product wasnt fulfilled. oh, it took a about 20days to get this product. way too long!"
4,Use a toothpick!,"These fit best if you have a small head. If you have a medium or larger head, slide a wooden tooth-pick into the middle of the underside of the 'strap' - this will work as a spreader bar and pull the speakers out by about an inch. With this mod these fit me perfectly!The sound is very good. Works flawlessly with my motorola q. With my motorola USB adapter it used to always takes me 2 or 3 tries to get a connection, but there's now a driver update for the adapter and the thing works flawlessly!Of course you CAN turn off the blue lights if you wish.I paid over $100 for them (before price reduction) and am happy with that deal."
3,Bluetooth headset,"This headset works ok, and just ok. The mic will only work for about 5 min before cutting out. This did not happen when they were new but a week later this problem started. I can stream audio while listing to DVD / Net radio, but when I try to talk for more than 5 min; problems. And this is after the unit has charged over night. Sound quality is so so, I may look at getting a set of BlueAnts to try out."
4,Moto HT 820,"The Moto HT 820 bluetooth headphones are a good product. They are easy to use and deliver good sound quality. They were easy to pair with my LG enV phone. The couple dislikes I have are first, they aren't comfortable for very long, nor can you wear them comfortably when seated with your head resting back on a chair. Second, the pictures don't give a feel for exactly how thick the ear pieces are - they stand off your ears quite a distance."
4,Great,"Exellent, but does not work with my Motorola 816, instead works with Nokia 6225..oops.I use it with my laptop...no problem..."
3,"Great functions and features, BUT...","Beautifully imaginative with functions, buttons, sound, technology...would be 5 stars IF there was ANY kind of way to adjust for size or placement at all...but there is none. All other functions are like a dream.I would imagine that Motorola will consider adjustments in future models of their bluetooth stereo headsets, and I personally am hopeful that they will release bluetooth stereo earbuds in the near future. That would eliminate most adjustment problems altogether..."
1,"Huge, clunky, uncomfortable and does not pair","If this unit looks big in the photo, brace yourself: it's like a bad science fiction rocket ship when it arrives. It is made of hard plastic with odd fins and protrusions everywhere. It does not rest easily on the head. It feels heavy and abrasive. I am surprised that none of these manufacturers have come up with a softer, lighter material, or spent any time considering how to fit a headset to the ears and head. Sony does a better job with its DRBT21G/B, but also falls victim to hard plastic and a hinge in the middle of the set that digs at your skull as time goes on. Truly astonishing.I could not get the unit to pair with my top-of-the-line Sony bluetooth transmitter. Motorola was ""kind"" enough to issue a stern warning about returning this item without calling their toll-free number. What a waste of time. They either don't answer the hone, or leave you hanging for long periods of time on hold."
5,Works well!,Works well - I personally do not like the behind the ear/head design but the sound quality is OK.
2,awesome sound.....fits like a medieval ear-ripping vise,"I agree with most that the sound quality and ease of use is great, in fact, excellent.Why only two stars? They may be the most uncomfortable headphones I've ever used.No, I do not have an extreme size melon. I have other headphones using the same ""back of the head"" support that I love.I suspect the main cause is the weight. They feel fine for about 15 minutes, then it shifts to ""head in a closing vise"" mode, with the added bonus of feeling as if my ears are being slowly sheered off my head.I keep bending the support band in hopes of finding a sweet spot...no luck yet. I guess my next approach will be padding...then a complete re-engineering of the support.Having said that, maybe they are the perfect fit for someone else's head. That lucky person would probably give them five stars."
2,Initally happy but went south,"It worked and was easy to install and use.But became more and more uncomfortable on the ears. Also as I asked the people I was talking to, ""how do I sound"" all answered ""clippy"" they missed about every fith word. I used it on Skype on my PC and my cellphone and had the same issue.Sound was good, both for music and speach.But had to return it."
3,Cheap ear fitting,sound quality is ok....the fitting on the speaker keeps coming out doesn't really fit well.
1,Motorola T820,Great Concept - Connected to my PC fine - Maybe too many buttons to remember. The conference quality was ok. Bluetooth audio was Bad. Battery charger did not work. Interesting I could charge through the USB cable though. It was the most painful product I have ever placed on my head. I gave it away one week after I tried it out. The combination of a heavy headset and plastic over ear hooks that are shaped like a knife made it imnpossible for me to wear.
2,Had to Return the headset because of incompatibility issues,"I should have known this...well made the mistake of buying it for the iPhone thinking if not A2DP compatible...atleast would come along with a transmitter to make the devices compatible. I was wrong. Anyways since couldn't test it, so don't know about its working capabilities..."
3,"For it's intended use, good but...","When I got this product in the mail, when I took it out, the very first thing I noticed was how enormous the headphones were. I didn't realize this when I ordered them because the photos always show these earphones at a certain angle. The reason why I bought these was to have a wireless solution to listening to music on the street and on the subway here in New York. If I were to grade this based on the use of this product, then I would give this product 4 stars. It worked well with my phone.However, being a shallow New Yorker, I was too self-conscious to wear these out in public because they're so large. There is at least an inch of headphone that juts out of your ear. Not only that, it's tagged with a huge Motorola M logo on it. So for those who don't mind having huge headphones jutting out of your ear, you can get these earphones. As for me, I got rid of these after one use."
3,Motorola H 98689 T820 Bluetooth Stereo Headset,works as advertised. sound quality cannot compare with my Koss Portapro wired headphones but it is very conveniant with no wires to get caught while I am working and automatically switches music off and resumes when making or taking phone calls.
3,good but has issues,"Pros: good bluetooth connection range and quality, well constructed, really nice to have the volume control and track control. Sound quality is pretty good for the price.Cons: The one size fit all is not a perfect option as for me particularly it hurts my upper ear after wearing it for an hour or so. I would have preferred an option to adjust size. The head phones look big and bulky a sleeker design would be desirable. When used in nosy environment they don;t provide any sound insulation but to Motorola's credit they do not claim that these are noise canceling.These are really good headphones but with some minor improvements such as a bit more sleeker, adjustable strap they could be excellent"
4,Worth the Price,I definately got my money's worth with these headphones. They may not be the best but for the price you will have a hard time finding something better. I use my for my phone and mp3 player and it does the job well. They may not fit your head perfectly (its a little big for mine) but it isn't too much of an issue.
3,Loses conncection to blackberry A LOT $ poor Vista support,"I can't really say I am pleased with the headset. It loses connection a lot to my 7290 blackberry and when using it with my Vista box, which is BT2.0 enabled I have had no luck getting the headset to work consistently. It works fine as headphones but with a lot of noise. I certainly would say this is not worth the bucks we spent on it as there is nothing more aggravating than a headset giving up on the connection during a call.Also, the ear pads tend to fall off and if you lose one: you get nailed by Moto for a new one. I mean, big, ridiculous bucks for that too.Much much happier with my WEP200."
1,sound Quality,The sound quality of this headset is BAD. No base at all. It is uncomfortable to wear. Not recomended to anyone.
1,Not compatable with just about anything,"I'm a gadget monkey and this thing looks, sounds, and feels great. Unfortunatly it fails to come close to working as adverstised.The only bluetooth adapters that work with it for PC use is the recomended mototala 850 adapter (most likely on purpose) so If you have your own your wasting your time it's not compatable. Even the correct adapter fails to work well, the sound comes through good on occasion but it's mostly either too high too low too fast or too slow.There are very few cell phones that support the blue tooth standard it uses so if it's for a cell phone/music player your wasting your money.Finally the only thing that makes it work with a PC (the chord) is so short it's useless. Not to mention it's the wrong standard to be used for cell phones.This thing should have been awesome. But it blows."
1,Piece of JUNK!,"Do not waste your money on this product. It claims it will connect to a music source AND your cell phone at the same time, WRONG, I have a Cingular 8525 (not a low end phone) and am using their pc850 adaptor for my computer, I bought the ""recommended"" package. It will not allow you to be listening to music on your computer AND monitor for phone calls at the same time, its one or the other, not both. as far as the ""high quality audio"" what are they basing that claim on? an AM radio station that is not quite on frequency? as a matter of fact, I know a.m. stations that sound better than these headphones! its not ""stereo"" at all, its dual channel mono at best. Another thing, these have to be the most uncomfortable headphones ever developed, after about 15 mins of use you have to remove them because your ears hurt so badly you can't stand it. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY OF THESE!"
1,Terrible!,"This is one of the most user UN-friendly devices I have ever purchased. I have several bluetooth devices which are easy to setup and work great. These headphones take a great deal of trial and error and guest work to set up. When I finally did get them up and running, the sound quality was very disappointing.I am amazed how (apparently) difficult it is to build good sounding stereo headphones (I could care less about stereo phonecalls). I would give this product ""0"" stars-but that is not an option."
1,I Got A Faulty One From AMAZON,"I am so pissed.I was so happy when i ordered it online, BUT it doesnt work.It turns on and the bluetooth indicator flashes, BUT it wont pair to ANYTHING.I tried 3 motorolla phones, a v710 & 2 razors... NOTHING!!!I tried a pocket pc from Dell, wont connect... HORRIBLE!!!Buy this product in person, at a store, and test it with your device.DONT BUY IT ON AMAZON!!!They didnt even offer me an option to leave FEEDBACK, so i am writing this REVIEWZERO Stars!"
4,"Almost perfect, Causes Mac to go into Kernel Panic","I would give it 5 if my computer will stop crashing, I am not sure who's at fault my computer software or the device.Pros:Sound quality is impressive, no difference between my set of full headphones and the HT-820.Easy set-up with a Macbook 10.5.3Battery life (at least 6 hours...)Comfortable to wear for long periods of time (4+ hours).Price (under $40).CON:After using the headphones for about 6 hours I got a kernel panic, rebooted repair permissions, updated to 10.5.4 and 10 minutes later another one.Four Kernel Panics total in 2 days. First time ever (16 months) I have suffered a kernel panic in this computer.I am back to my old wired headphones until I can find a fix and will update the review."
4,great multipurpose headphone,"I paired these with a Blackjack. The sound quality for speaking is good, people I spoke with didn't notice I was using a headset. For music, the sound quality is average (I'm used to Etymotics and Shure headphones, which are great), but the functionality makes up for it. I used these while working out and snowboarding. The wireless freedom is great. For snowboarding, having the button to pause on the right ear is also great, and having the last dialed button on the left ear to switch from music to calling back the last person I spoke with, was great on the slopes. Didn't have to take my gloves off.I only give it 4 stars because the music sound quality has room to improve. i'm guessing high quality bluetooth headphones (when they come out) are going to be double the price at least though."
4,Good sound,"I like this product. Sought it out on a friend's recommendation. A little bulky, but the sound quality overcompensates generally. Not much info with the product mailer, but nothing too complicated with the help of a Sprint customer service representative."
3,Average product,"The headset is a bit heavy and is uncomfortable for wearing periods of more than 30 minutes. The headset works well for calls, but is not great for music as the audio quality doesn't match wired headphones. But very useful for skype calls, no problems in pairing. Buy this if you plan to use this mainly as a wireless headset for calls/skype and occasional music listening."
2,"great sound, but heavy on the ears and awful microphone","The headset is cool, and has very good speakers for phone and music, but it is very heavy on my ears. Also, the microphone is not directional, so ALL background noises are picked up, which makes it impossible to use for conference calls in a public place (like an airport)."
2,Not worth,"This headset is supposed to work with cellphones and other sources of audio over bluetooth.Well, if I can just ""hear"" that audio that's not good enough. The sound quality is pretty bad when I connect to my computer and play music.2 stars are for ease of setup and average audio quality when used with cell phone."
4,Fantastic product but...,if this is used with the T-Mobile MDA (HTC Wizard) you must upgrade the OS for all functions in this product to work. The signal may also go in and out. I believe this has more to do with the bluetooth technology than the headphones. Overall this is a solid product.
5,Best Bluetooth Accessory,It works great with my LG Fusic phone for both mp3 playback and voice calls and controls are handy when changing songs on my phone!! Battery life is great in all a great product!!!
4,great head phones,I like the wireless feature and the great sounds. Disadvantage is the lack of size adjustment and the slightly larger earphones. It does weigh a bit more than other headsets. Bluetooth is the way to go for the future. I don't like the tangled wires...-Jack
3,One size does NOT fit all,"The sound quality is great. yes it was a little difficult to set up with my laptop (could be Windows XP's problem though). This would have at least 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that is has NO size adjustments... NONE! It is amazing that this was overlooked. As a result, they can be uncomfortable to wear."
3,these are great but additional stuff is needed,"i bought these for my husband because they were more ""low profile"" than others i had seen. he opened them on Christmas and we were surprised to find out that we needed to purchase a transmitter for them. i thought all of them came with a transmitter. aperently only some models are packaged with both pieces. he was so sad that he had to wait 2 more weeks to try them out. they are very comfortable and the sound quality is great."
3,"Horrible Sound Quality, Not meant for music fans","I bought these to use on my Macbook Pro, so that I could use VOIP as well as listening to music when I'm working without having to worry about cables. While it certainly does fine in the VOIP front, where sound quality isn't really important, it is an utter failure as a set of headphones for listening to music.The music comes through as if you were on a cell phone and the person you were talking to was holding their phone up to a radio. So I would definitely not recommend these to anyone getting them with that purpose in mind.I certainly wasn't expecting them to sound as great as a good pair of headphones, but I was completely disappointed, music sounds about as good as listening to them on a dirt cheap set of wired headphones."
5,"Excellent product, superior audio quality for a bluetooth headset.","This product is great for home users. I never thought that this product have this kind of quality audio and was so comfortable. It can be used for a long time without need to be charging again, and you can answer a call at the same time if you are using it with your phone. I recommend this product."
4,Works with LG VX10000 Voyager,"They do hurt the top of my left ear after a while of use. Otherwise they are rather comfortable. The sound quality far exceeded my expectations. If you can live with the ""Princess Leia"" earmuffs look, then these are for you.It was between this and the S9, the 30$ difference in price wasn't a problem for me. It was just that the S9 had received so many negative reviews regarding workmanship of the product itself. Lots of faulty S9's that needed returning, and I just wasn't into dealing with that. Plus the in-ear style of head buds has never sat well with me. I like the over the ear style better.TIP: hold FWD > & REV < buttons at the same time to turn off the blue lights that come on and off at random. I see people ragging on these almost exclusively because of this, its an option that can be turned off/on."
4,Good Bluetooth Headset,"I purchased this unit primarily to take advantage of the MP3 player function in my new LG Shine Phone.As some of the other raters have mentioned, the fit behind the ears is a bit snug, but it is not as painful as some have described. It sits well on the neck and does not catch on my collar or when I lie down in my hammock. The one aspect that I find challenging is knowing when the unit is fully turned off to avoid draining the battery.It has very clear sound, in fact I hear much more to the recordings than I do playing them through the computer speakers."
4,Motorola HT820 Bluetooth Stereo Headset,"product works as expected, sterio quality is good. loop over the ears is a bit uncomfortable after a few hours. phone works great with it. needs more options for hanging them on your head. used with an LG VX8300 phone."
4,Glad to have it,"I originally bought IO bluetooth phones but they didn't work very well and not at all with my phone. These are made by Motorola so compatible with my phone, sound great, seamless to answer the phone while listening to the music on it. Very pleased with them so far..."
4,Review after a few weeks,"this product is decent at what it does however there are several problems. the earpieces seems to get loose and fallout fairly easily, the bluetooth reception from a dell x51v is limited when walking around. (there are times when the music is not fluid) sound quality is limited for something this size.however i do like the wireless connectivity, the option to use a cable where signals maybe limited. and is very much usable when sitting down"
2,Looked nice with flaws,I like the look of this headset and it was compatible to my treo but not the bluetooth stereo and I did not realize it till I got it. I could still use it with a cord. It did work on my sons phone via the bluetooth. Not having it but a couple of weeks I had problems with one side of ear piece going in and out when you use it so I sent it back and am waiting to either get a new one or refund.
3,Not The Greatest Sound Quality,"The ability to have headphones without wires is a plus, but you can do better if you're really interested in high quality sound. My Sony MDR-G57G's sound far better at 1/3 the price. Too bad they aren't wireless...At almost $80, you should expect a richer frequency response from these phones (really muddy base range). The foam cushions have a way of falling off too, so you have to be careful when handling them. If having a built-in mike and the ability to exploit the mp3 player on your cell phone is your only objective, then go for these. But if you want to hear your music without a significant loss in quality, then save your money and go for the MDR-G57G (and resign yourself to a wire)."
3,"May be nice, but did not fit","Never got a chance to try it because you need all the Bluetooth things on your audio devices and TV. I am sure if I know a TV that comes with Bluetooth, so you have to buy the transmiter before you can use it.Anyway, the headphone fit *snugly* on my neck. And it is uncomfortable. So, back in the box and back to Amazon."
3,Not perfect...,"Setup with a MacBook could not have been easier - just go to the Bluetooth system panel and choose ""headset"". The mac recognizes both the headphones and the microphone automagically. That said, the sound quality playing music is disappointing. Perhaps I'm missing something, but the quality is AM radio at best."
1,Non user friendly,The manual said they could link with my PDA and Smartphone in order to listen to music and they won't other than making a call they are useless unless you plug the cable into them.
2,disappointing...,"Uncomfortable to wear, to big in size, annoying blinking blue light but sound quality was good and easy to pair with other bluetooth products. I ended up returning them for I-Muffs from wi-gear which I like better."
3,Not enough respect for the Queen of the Blues,"I own a blues bar, and feel qualified to say that the producers have effectively snubbed the one woman who has done more for woman in Blues than any other for the last 35 years -namely by not show - casing Bonnie Raitt on her own- her vocals, slide guitar and songs have inspired all of these artists - at least Susan Tedeschi acknowleges that -I shall NOT be playing this in public, out of respect to Bonnie."
1,"Fits all inflatables, except (of course) Advanced Elements","So I oredered this pump for my Advanced Elements AdvancedFrame Convertible. I figured that if I ordered the pump from the manufaturer of the kayak, it would for sure fit their valves. But no, this pump does not include the adapter to fit their own kayak. So their product description should read: will fit all inflatables except for our own."
5,DanceFit Abs and Legs in Minutes,"My apologies to all who've bought this DVD hoping it would be a cardio workout. The information appearing on this page describing the content of this DVD is wrong. This DVD is a strength and tone workout for legs and abs. It is not a cardio dance DVD. Obviously, and quite frustrating to me as the producer of this program,Amazon.com has either been given the wrong information, or has placed the wrong cover on this page, or has erroneously placed the information for DanceFit Salsa Sizzler DVD on this DVD. That DVD also stars Lisa Wheeler and is a cardio-dance workout combining various latin dance moves and styles with standard aerobic fitness moves. None of our DanceFit(r) cardio DVD's (Salsa Sizzler and Latin Retro) have been structured for non-dance beginners."
3,Dancefit Sculpt: abs and legs in minutes,"The editorial review states: ""In DanceFit Cardio: Salsa SizzlerDance/fitness expert Lisa Wheeler gets you in the groove with a series of heart-pounding segments featuring the most popular Latin dances the Salsa, the Cha-Cha, the Samba, the Merengue and the Rumba. Each 10-minute workout segment is combined with traditional fat-burning cardio moves to help melt away inches and give you the tonedand sculpted look of a dancer.DVD Includes:Warm-UpThe SalsaThe Cha-ChaThe MerengueThe SambaRumba Cool-DownBonusSalsa LessonStick around after the workoutfor a bonus Salsa lesson with Cal.""This is not the case. There is no dance, whatsoever, on this DVD.It is simply two segments, one for abs and one for legs, of standing and floor exercises.If that is what you want to do, it is good. But, if like me, you want dance and aerobic exercise, this is not the one to buy!Obviously, I should have paid more attention to the title than to the description."
2,false advertisment,"I was under the impression that I would be dancing to work my abs and legs, but I was wrong. This is like any other workout dvd-except the fact that this one only works your abs and legs. And the ""abs"" workout works mostly your legs instead of your abs. Don't waste your money-it's not what you think"
1,much too hyped for its own good,"I anticipated this book more than almost any other new young poet's collection of the past year. The ""blurbs"" accompanying the book are extraordinary, announcing Field as a virtual literary savior for her generation. Yet, unfortunately, the experimental, whimiscal, and nonsensical formal play in the book makes for all dazzle and dance and very little else. These poems look gorgeous on the page, intriguing, inviting because they simply *look* exciting, and yet the stories and thinking and images in each fall blandly, flatly, dead silent on the ground. For all its experimentation, the book actually borders on the cliche."
2,Not as pictured.,"I was very disappointed when the product arrived and there was no metal stand. It was only then that I saw rather hidden in the product page that the stand was optional. However, I was also unable to find where I could select that option. I would've purchased it if I could find it anywhere on the seller's page. Even still.So I now have this really pretty candle holder that doesn't stand on it's own, lying in a box until I find something to display it with elsewhere. But I will say the star itself is quite lovely, especially the color."
4,Better Than Expected,"The subtitle of ""Rock Opera"" doesn't exactly warm your heart right off the bat. The only Rock Opera I've ever enjoyed was the Pants Opera that Five Iron Frenzy blessed us with at the end of their EP.Having said all that, this one surprised me. I thought it had cheeze written all over it when I first read about it. But many of the songs are above average. Though most stand on their own (void of any running theme) and sound like they were each written in standard pop-song form (rather than opera or broadway), I was pleased with the discs overall.The huge standout is ""Raised in Harlem"" by T-Bone - a wonderful retelling of the story of Jairus. ""Kill the Hero"" and ""Shadowman"" also have great sonic qualities, but I find myself (ironically) guilty about singing lyrics that lead to Jesus' demise.A pretty good effort overall. I just hope they can pull it off onstage."
4,Very Good Equipment,"I bought this equipment and I'm satisfied with the quality of video that can display. The sound is good, but if you try to display images while a song is playing noise is produced. The quality of the images is poor, because you need to convert it to BMP images and poor resolution. But in general you can not expect more for than cheap price."
1,beware Amazon electronics,"We bought this player for our daughter for Christmas. It's not easy to set up. It's not easy to download songs onto. You can't organize your songs (except by using numbers in your naming schema). Our new computer would not read the software disk that was included. The function keys are not at all intuitive -- and took several tries to operate, as desired. There was no way we thought our pre-teen daughter would be able to manage it on her own. We ended up getting a similarly priced RCA model which works and sounds great and is easy to use. When I tried to return the Coby one to Amazon, I was told that because it had been opened they would only offer a partial refund (even though it was cleaned off and in mint condition). I would not only beware of the Coby mp3 player, but I would beware of buying any electronic from Amazon."
2,Beware of looks!,"I had no trouble downloading songs onto it, although I understand there's no rhyme or reason as to what order they're in. The problem I had was with the video part of it - it is advertized on the package that you can download videos - forget that - I have one manual for my model, the company has a different manual for the same model, and the company's website troubleshooter recomments something different. The only advantaga this has over som others is that it has a spot on it so you can hang it around your neck."
2,Awfull,"It is still working after six months, but I thought not.Not possible to put the songs in order or inside directories. All songs have to be accomodated as they are entered.The software is not good, is a bad quality building.To see a video you need a special conversion, with a bad software.Not recommendable. Instead of it, Creative has MP3 and video of high quality."
1,Buyer Beware,"I recommend that no one buys this. I bought it thinking, awesome, although it is not an iPod, it looks good, and will do a lot of the functions that an iPod can do. Boy was I in for a shock. Not only was it the tiniest little cheap thing, but also the screen picture was horrible!! I have a Wal-Mart brand MP3 Player that has better picture than this one. Trust me, do not buy this product!"
2,Not worth it,"The book should rightly be titled ""how to Change your Drum Heads"" as it has little info about tunings other than the physical steps one takes to mount and tighten drums heads. ""Tune up for Jazzy"" ""Tune down for rock"" that's about it -"
4,GREAT BOOK!,"OK THIS IS A GREAT BOOK ENTRY LEVEL OR ANYTHING YOU WANT,BUT YOU HAVE TO UPTODATE ON YOUR TUNING ,SNARE DRUM IS THE WORST ENEMY,SO PRACTICE ON THE SNARE ONCE GET THE SNARE THE BEST OR TUNE IT CORRECTLY AND PROPERLY.THEN THE TOMS AND BASS ARE CHILDREN.THE THING ABOUT THE SNARE BUZZ TOO MUCH IT VIBRATES.THIS IS THE RIGHT BOOK TO GET YOU STARTED,GOODLUCK ON TUNING!"
3,Not what I expected.,"Since this shawl was mostly cashmere, I expected it to be very very soft--it isn't. It feels more like a wool than chasmere/silk. I probably won't wear it, but will give it away to someone."
1,This is the worst.,"They marked the list price way too high. And even sale price @$25 is too high as well compare the quality of the product. Don't be fooled by the picture. I got four and they arrived in one ~13""x10"" envelop. Can you imaging that sized Shawl as shown on the photo can be stuffed in one single envelop?I end up returned all to the seller. it totally cost me $30 for shipping on both ways. Please DO NOT consider this product/seller at all, ever."
2,Service was great but the shawl was a bit of a disappointment,"Service was great. I got my shawls in record time. However, I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the shawls (I ordered burnt orange and black). From the picture of the woman wearing the shawl, I expected a really warm cuddly shawl but it turned out to be more of a cotton throw. I would not recommend buying this shawl."
3,"Great shawl, but the service needs work.","I recently purchased the Lipstick Red shawl. It was the perfect shade of red that I needed. The shawl itself was in a sealed bag with the tags on it. I'm completely satisfied with the product.Now for the dislikes:There was not an invoice(receipt) in the box in which the shawl came in. Luckily, I did not have to return it. But it came with a solicitation for me to become a member of the Pashmina Group and sell them out of my house on my own.(Think like Avon or Amway products, something like that)Another concern was that I received no email communications on the shipping status of my order. No tracking number, nothing stating that it was on it's way. However, an upside to that is when I sent them an email they did respond with answers the next morning.I am happy with this purchase but I think that the seller should be more pro-active in getting those emails out to us buyers to help calm our shipping jitters! :-)"
2,Return policy is iffy,"I called yesterday, on January 2, to inquire about exchanging a gift for the same item in a different color and was told to call back January 3 when the ""returns"" department was open. I called today (Jan 3) to inquire about the color I wanted. As far as I could tell, it's all the same person, and there is no ""returns"" department. I was told they didn't have the color I wanted but they would call when they received the package - but I had checked and it's available online for purchase. I will post follow-up but wanted to warn potential customers."
2,Does not feel like cashmere.....or silk,"I was disappointed when this arrived. I was so excited when I ordered it. It does not feel soft like cashmere or silk. It's kind of scratchy actually. I mean I could wear it. It's not uncomfortable but not what I'd expected, not the soft feel that cashmere has in my experience. I'm returning it."
2,"Accurate color, but itchy",I suspect that the reported fiber content is bull. I ordered two of these from different sellers and this one is nearly unwearable against skin compared to the other one I bought. Unfortunately I loooove the color.
2,Took Over 1 Month to be Delivered,"I ordered a shawl in mid-December for my sister for Christmas. Not only did it not come for Christmas, but she just received it Jan. 25th! It took a month and a half to arrive. I never received any shipment confirmation or tracking number, so it was impossible to know if it would ever arrive. I paid 12 dollars in shipping, which should have been free after taking so ridiculously long to arrive. It is impossible to get ahold of anyone in customer service. I would strongly advise you to not purchase this product here. You may never receive it or you'll grow old waiting for it to arrive."
1,Description challenged,"The use of the adverb ""luxuriously"" was certainly too lofty...Quality of the shawl was anything but that. Fabric is stiff, maybe warm but not of the quality of other Cashmere Pashminas I have purchased in the past."
4,Pleased Bride,"I ordered 8 of these in Inky Navy to give to my bridesmaids to wear the night of our wedding. My girls were wearing very formal navy satin dresses and I was a little worried that the color might clash with the dress, but I when they arrived I was pleased. The package arrived within a few days of placing my order (I payed extra for quick delivery) and the shawls were definitely a very high quality for a pretty low price. I read all of the other reviews before ordering and I have to agree that they are a little scratchy on sensitive skin - but not bad enough to keep me from ordering one for myself..."
2,poor quality,Not worth the price! Very bad quality and comes with a strange smell. I even washed it with the machine and still can't get rid of it. There are some decent cashmere products available at this price. Don't buy this one.
3,at least they match...,"i'm not quite sure how i feel about this purchase... they match my silverware BUT they are not what i expected a ""steak knife"" to be. the ""serrated"" edge, strangely, is only serrated on one side of the knife. i tried them out on a steak and they worked ok, but i don't know if i would purchase them again given the opportunity."
3,Everything But The Armband,The chargers are obviously a welcome addition and the silicone case is handy. The armband would probably fit snug around the bicep of an infant! So do not buy this for the armband! The total price for what you get is amazing though so don't hesitate in getting the bundled goodies.
3,Good for time...poor for radio,"The various time functions are well thought-out...Too, the large and well lit display is fine.Radio reception i poor, worse than previous, much less costly clock radios I've had."
5,Great clock,"I purchased this clock for my daughter because I've been using this same clock for years. It works great, aside from occasionally screwing up on the daylight savings time. The dual alarms are perfect and easy to turn on and off without having to reset for the following day and the clock itself is compact so it doesn't take up a lot of space on the nightstand."
1,Avoid! Doesn't know new daylight saving time rules.,"Unless the manufacturer has updated this with a new model, you'll be very disappointed when the time does NOT advance one hour on March 11, 2007 (you will have to adjust it yourself). And then, 3 weeks later, it WILL advance an hour (following the old rules) and you'll have to manually set it back an hour.Come October & November, you'll get to go through that chicken dance again, in reverse.If that doesn't matter to you, then it's a reasonably good product. Just don't be fooled: It is NOT an ""atomic clock"" that sets itself via radio signals -- it does an ""auto time set"" using a long-life internal battery (should be good for 5 years or more) and the time is set before it leaves the factory. The AAA batteries that YOU supply are to power the display and buzzer if the power goes out; the clock keeps time with the other battery that the manufacturer put into it."
1,Poorly designed alarm clock,"It's not ""dual alarm"" as its name implies. It's a M-F alarm and a weekend alarm. If you are among the thousands of us, health care workers and the like, who don't get every weekend off, it's not designed for you. You have to manually adjust every different wake time, running up or down through all the minutes.Incredibly, it has no off-switch. If you wake up before the alarm goes off, you can't disable it. You have to wait for it to buzz, then turn it off. That's just plain annoying.UPDATE: OK, I have had this thing a few weeks now, and I have learned some new things about it. The directions don't exactly tell you this, but if you read between the lines, you figure out you can set one wake time on the buzzer, and another on the radio, setting them both for ""Everyday."" Then switch back and forth as you need. If you want to turn it off before it alarms, find the secret buttons under the little door, figure out which one is which, and turn off the alarm.Make it 2 stars."
2,daylight savings dates are wrong (old dates),"The daylights savings is wrong, it uses the old dates when its changed.So i don't see how the manufacturer can claim that it auto sets time."
2,Good info but very negative,"I thought this book contained good information on infertility, particularly IVF. However, I felt it was unnecessarily negative and its primary purpose seemed to be to induce fear. While I am all for telling it like it is, the author seems to focus too much on the negative aspects of the process. You finish the book with more worries than you started with, rather than feeling good about the decision you made.Certainly everyone reacts to this situation differently but the level of complaining seemed a little excessive. There are other books out there with the same good information where the author tells it like it is without all the negativity."
3,SO HELPFUL!!,"I have been struggling with fertility for 3 years and no publication has been as useful as this book.I would love to meet the author and give her a great big hug.This book has really helped me. I felt so alone in the process.I have read message boards, but this book surpasses the message board for me. I loved the suggestion about a care package.I appreciated that she advised readers not to fear IVF and not to allow your fear to stop you from persuing treatment. The book really made me think. Most of all, it made me feel like what I have experienced is normal for women in my situation.Thank you!"
5,A Must Read for Infertility,"I laughed and cried at the amount of similarities my story has compared to Ms. Swire-Falker's. Maybe that is why I so highly recommend this book. I know the ins and outs of ART, its terminology, treatments, procedures etc. and felt a kindred spirit as I read her story. Infertility is isolating, painful both emotionally and physically, and terrifying on so many levels. To read about someone's journey, feelings, emotions, thoughts and experiences so candidly is consoling and relieving. I think she did a great job and I recommend this book as an infertile myself and medical professional."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"As someone who has walked the road of infertility, I can say that this book ranks number one in my opinion. Infertility is a hard path and this book validates the fear, uncertainty, and sorrow of infertility. Most importantly though the book offers a great resource for the different options and struggles that may meet the infertility patient on the road to parenthood. Ms. Swire-Falker tells it like no one before her. She is there with you each step of the way and offers advice and guidance and most importantly understanding. Only a great author can make the infertility patient smile and laugh at some of the worst that infertility has to offer. Hats off to Ms. Swire-Falker for offering such a book to the legions of infertility patients nationwide."
5,Thank You Ms. Swire-Falker!,"For writing a book that is easy to read yet so full of information. In the two years of dealing with infertility, I have never read a book that was written as if the author was a good friend and talking to me. But, yet, Swire-Falker accomplishes that with this book. There is so much information in this book and presented in a comfortable and easily digested manner. Swire-Falker covers so much in this book: Finding a good RE or Fertility Clinic, Testing, Diagnosis, Treatment Options, Affording Infertility, Understanding Your Cycle, Beginning IF Treatments and more. This book has it all! Ms. Swire-Falker, THANK YOU for writing this book!"
3,Get it from the library...,"...and see if it's for you. As other reviewers have noted, the author writes from a patient's perspective and includes a lot of her own experiences. On the positive side, as a 'what to expect' for someone going through IVF it's pretty helpful. The author explains different drugs and regimens in a user-friendly way, and includes helpful tips for dealing with various aspects of IVF. (To the author, if you're reading this: your injection instructions would be much more useful with illustrations!) On the negative side, I couldn't really relate to many of the more personal tips and experiences. I don't want my infertility to become the sole focus of my life and I'm not about to take a leave of absence from my job to manage the process."
2,Simply not the book for me...,"Goodness, I wish I had read all of the reviews before purchasing this book. When my husband and I found out that we had a few infertility issues to address we promised ourselves to try and stay positive and not to become obessed with having a biological child. The experiences Ms. Swire-Falker had to endure were incredibly unfortunate, but I found myself thinking...stop the procedures and get on with your life. She seemed obsessed with having a baby and I simply didn't relate. My husband and I love children and want to have a family, but not at the cost of my career, our marriage, or financial security. There was some useful information, so I did find the book helpful on some fronts."
2,not the best I've read,"I read 3 books on this subject, and this was my least favorite out of all three. I found it a bit negative and reading it almost made me more focused on the negative aspects of infertility. The information was good, but not as good and not as easy to navigate as other books I've read."
4,"Infertility Does Suck, But this Book Doesn't",I found this book touched on just about everything. Recommended.
4,Very good overview of IF.,"This book was a quick read with lots of good information. It covers a wide variety of topics, from IF treatments to how it affects your relationship. I really enjoyed this book."
5,Reading this book is like studying with the finest master!,"Jim Webb is one of our true American treasures in the world of pop music. How lucky we are as songwriters to get the opportunity to get inside his heart and mind as he moves through the process of writing a song. Particularly interesting is Webb's take on lyrics......why he would or wouldn't use certain rhymes, for example. He addresses every part of the process, from formulating ideas to coming up with the best hook to the form of the song and on to writing the lyrics, melody and chord progression. He talks about some of the best written songs in pop music, disecting them and using them as examples. There is such an amazing amount of useful information in this book, it requires multiple readings to fully grasp it all. All in all, reading this book is like going to school and studying with the very finest master there is in the field of songwriting!"
4,Serious book for serious songwriters,"One of the reviews cited on the back cover calls the book a master class in songwriting. It is. But it is not for the musically illiterate--gotta know them little dots on the staff before you crack this book.Webb goes deep into the structures and grammar of musical creation, phrasing, cadence, theme, motif, etc. etc. And his discussion of the blending of lyrics and music is profound and fascinating. But light reading, it ain't. If you are a play-by-ear musician who often says ""I don't read enough music to hurt my playing,"" accompanied by self-deprecating aw-shucks grin, don't even think about buying this book."
5,Good Book,"Theory about songwriting inside this book is the deepest I have found. Even the language of the writer is good, it is hard for non english spoken people because of the extensive use of non common words."
3,Well written but narrow view,"Ok so the guy's had some hits, but does that entitle him to classify some rhymes as ""Wrong"" and others as ""Mistakes""? There's quite a bit of contradiction when he lays down what he believes are correct rhymes then gives a Goffin/King song as an example of Master songwriting on the next page that is full of the very ""mistakes"" he claims make songs amateurish. The rhymes he would like to see (ie true rhymes like cat, mat, sat etc) are precisely the ones I try to avoid in my own songs as they sound over used and too neat. I prefer (like many songwriters!)half rhymes and words that sound similiar. OK so I haven't sold as many records but I doubt that this is why... Having said all that, the book is very well written and he does have alot of very helpful stuff to impart. I suppose it was just his blanket right/wrong approach that annoyed me as this is the sort of attitude that makes any artform stand still and stagnate."
2,Should be on CD,"No doubt Jimmy Webb is a great song writer. However, I found this title too technical as I play by ear. Had the standard notation portions been recorded, I would have gotten more out of this book. I'm sure people with formal musical education will get a lot out of it.Blane Coxcoxhb@hotmail.comwww.twitter.com/blanecox"
2,Not what you think!!,"Bottom line... Jimmy breaks his own rules about songwriting w/ book writing. ""Too much Talking""....""Using words over the listeners heads"". In our case the reader's heads.You have to read through his overused ""Hey, look at me write big words"" and that takes away from the point of songwriting. The focus gets lost a lot. He doesn't do a good job of delivering the point. Or should I say... it's hard to find the valuable information through all the invaluable information.Andrea Stolpe's book will make more sense of what Jimmy failed to do. I recommend picking this one up."
1,too verbose for my taste,He could have said his message in much fewer words. It's pretty typical for many authors to say too much. Maybe some people need to hear it said again and again. Or maybe publishers pay by weight (joking).
1,Seams that leak,"Bought this with high expectations from the description -- seemed like the perfect carafe for me....BUT, water leaked from the seams and presumably the base where it was plugged. When left upon my counter after tightly closing it, there was always a small puddle of water under it. Can't recommend. Ended up with a beautiful one from Gevalia which has a seamless bottom that Does Not leak."
5,Gorgeous,"Love this cake platter, its beautiful and very heavy. Matches my other crystal serving wear perfectly! Arrived in perfect condition!"
5,Beautiful,This cake plate is more beautiful than I thought. It makes a nice decoration for my china cabinet when not using it for a cake. I was also very happy with the prompt delivery and the packaging. The fragile cake plate arrived without damage. I know I will be please with all the compliments when I use it for my next get together with my friends.
2,"Inspirational -Yes, Educational- No","This book was more of a motivational speech than an actual hair guide on dreadlocks. There might have been one paragraph on actually locking your hair while the rest of the book is spent on the author's life and how he overcame the stares and looks to get a job he liked. There is also a section on being more educated on african culture, such as going to multicultural events and participating in black history month and kwanza. I already do these things so the last thing I need is someone telling me to do this just because I want dreadlocks. This book just wasn't worth it."
2,"Should be called ""My life experience with dreadlocks""","I was disappointed in this book because I felt the author may have mislead the reader with the title. The book is actually about his own personal experenciences in life with his dreadlocks - It's more like an autobiography. It does have a little information about how to care for your locs as well as your physical and mental well-being, but it wasn't exhaustive by any means. There is so much more information about how to start and maintain locs and he didn't even scratch the surface. BOTTOM LINE - If you want to hear the life story of a man with locs and his personal revelations...buy this book. But if you want concrete information about starting, maintaining, and (basically) living with locs...DON'T buy this book."
2,MIDI keyboard optional? NOT!,"In the system requirements for this program, it states that a MIDI keyboard is optional. Apparently that means that if you opt to use the program, you need that ""optional"" keyboard! If you don't plan to use the program, then a keyboard isn't necessary...stupid!I researched programs to practice sight reading without a MIDI keyboard, and most programs stated the requirements clearly - a MIDI keyboard is necessary. For this particular program, the system requirements are definitely misleading!I can't review how well it works, because I can't use it. I'm not a happy customer. Caveat Emptor."
5,"Great product, Super low price","I ordered this for my son as a companion to the Yamaha keyboard, I bought him for Christmas, Yes I let him try it out early. ""I'm a softy"".Anyway, I also wanted to buy him software, but after spending $100 on the keyboard I needed a deal. Well, he loves it! He has already, down loaded the CD on his computer. He also had composed and saved a song on his computer with this software. He said it did teach him a bit more than he already knows. He did already know a little bit about how to read music. He taught himself to read with an inexpensive music book."
2,Same As 4th Edition,"I had to take the class that required this book two times and the second time, they had upgraded from the 4th edition to this 5th edition. So I went out and bought this new 5th edition only to find out when I got to class that the only real difference between the two books was that the chapters were in a different order, all of the chapter headings were the same! Waste of money, just buy the 4th edition.The Sciences: An Integrated Approach, Fourth Edition"
3,Good intentions with conceptual problems,"The book covers a lot of subjects with the intention of providing a basic aproach to science. There are some lack of precise characterization of important concepts. For instance, it confuses heat with internal energy ( not heat as energy in transit). Also it does not defines mass adequatetly as a measure of inertia, which may cause confusion when one studies relativity. These were problems detected at first sight. I suggest to by, through Amazon, ""Integrated Science"", by Tillery, Enger and Roos, from Mc Graw Hill, to get a general view of fundamental science with a more clear, and rigorous definition of terms."
5,An excellent textbook on Physics. Excellent service. Thanks.,This is a great book to review a former Physics course or simply learn physics today. I recomment it highly.
1,Vendor service review / feedback,Ordered this item from A1Books online. Promptly a box arrived with the wrong items (Ink Cartridge instead of Computer Software). Left multiple voicemails (Cust Service)for vendor with no response. 3 weeks later an email was received with a procedure for obtaining an RMA from their system. 3 weeks (3 email reminders to their President - COO) later that I am STILL awaiting a response from the vendor on how to get the RMA process to work for me. Hope I can complete the RMA process and get my money back.I must remember NEVER to order anything from this vendor in the future.
5,FRIGHTENINGLY REALISTIC!,"As a former Chief Law Enforcement Officer, I found this book gripping, with the very REAL potential for the events described within to actually happen in American society within our own lifetime. Brilliant writing, brilliant concept, believable characters and some of the most awesome possible future fiction I have ever read! This book is truly believable in all it's implications for our potential future. ANY serious reader, despite his or her reading preferences will enjoy this book, and finish it feeling haunted. I give this work my highest recommendation and anxiously await the remainder of the series."
3,Desperately trying to locate Kokane cd!,I am desperately trying to find Kokane's cd for a friend's birthday on the 23rd. I am having a lot of trouble locating it! Any suggestions?Thanks
2,Poor LCD display on this clock makes it not worth buying.,"I really like all the functions available on this clock. The one complaint I have is the LCD display.First, the LCD backlight makes it way too bright for nighttime use--even at the dimmer setting. It's like having a small, fully lit computer screen in your bedroom at night.Second, in order to read the display, your eyes have to be level with it. This is true regardless of whether it's day or night. Putting this clock at a height above your head makes it impossible to read from the bed.The newer Timex model (T617) has a much better display."
1,It is not a digital tuning clock radio,I returned this item without even using it because:1. It does not have a digital tuner as described.2. The CD player won't even spin to read my music CD's.I will put 0 star if there is such a choice
1,CD player stopped working,"After about 4 months the CD player stopped working completely in this clock. One night I played a CD fine, that CD finished and I put in a new CD. It attempted to turn the disc, stopped, and the display showed ""no."" It has refused to play a disc ever since.As I read through other reviews I am noticing that others have had a similar experience.Buyer Beware, this is a poor product."
4,works great!,"My daughter got this clock for Christmas and she loves it! She loves waking up to her favorite CD, programmed to her favorite songs. This clock works just fine!"
3,Unofficial Release,"This CD is not an official (legal) release. Rather, it was created by a fan and packaged with a fake label and UPC code. I've met the man who did the mastering, and he explained how he added loops in his favorite tracks, created the fake label name and code, etc. Given that the actual rightsholders have not seen fit to do an official release, I think this somewhat altered version is worth a purchase. The sound is excellent, and the original LP is extremely hard to come by in any condition. I think customers have the right to know what they're getting, but it worth getting if you're a fan of the film or the score."
3,Original soundtrack altered,"I was happy to recently discover that the soundtrack of the 1970 film ""Pufnstuf"" had been released on CD. I was a huge fan of the show as a kid, and this was the first soundtrack LP I ever bought. Purchasing the CD allowed me to relive a bit of my childhood, without the pops and clicks from the scratches on my old vinyl album.But I'm a bit puzzled by the fact that this CD release has altered tracks. Most of the tracks include passages where a bar or two of the music has been looped, adding a few seconds of repeated music for no apparent reason. The result is jarring for anyone that is already familiar with the music, and seems quite unnecessary. I've written to El Records to ask why this was done. Legal reasons?"
2,Pufnstuff CD disapointment,I would have liked to have known the songs that were on the CD and for the description to include the fact that it was from the movie and not the TV series. The songs are not what I was expecting and none were familiar.
3,Not a reliable detector.,"I got this detector because it was remote controlled, so I could put in the rear windshield since it has 360 detection; but the remote only has a 4-foot range. I have to reach back and hold it down for a while for it to pick up.I like that it is compact and has voice alerts so I can just listen to them.I live in Houston and would expect a lot of signals, but I'm not sure if the detector is sensitive enough or it is just filtering stray signals but I hardly get any alerts from it. I passed several patrols on a trip, it does not seem to pick up unless their radar is not on or using an unknown band.Now, the alert suddenly goes off at random and doesn't shut off. This detector does not seem to be very reliable. I would revise my review to 2 stars. I returned this item and would not recommend it."
1,Not worth the trouble!,"Product produces hundreds annoying false alarms! I returned my unit one week after I received it. On a 100 mile freeway trip the unit beep non-stop(without a reason), I finally got annoyed at turn it off."
2,Drowsy musings,Decent if you are a fan but there's nothing really worth pursuing outside of their limited appeal.
1,Lots of Bugs! Topic Entertain publishes this CD,"The company Topic does a lousy job at customer service. As for the developer, maybe some third rate company. The scans of the maps are not high enough for area blow ups. Everything is fuzzy at best. The interface is clumsy ... sluggish ... backwards! This is the 21st Cen! If you have a Garmin, stick with their apps for now. Or just buy an old fashion topo map.*Avoid this product!!!!"
2,Should have check first,"I went looking at Fry's for a mapping software and bought this before looking online at reviews. I'm now stuck with a bazillion (ok, just 17) CDs and a product that takes minutes to load once you initiallize the program. I still can't figure out how to access any info on Hawaii or Alaska and I'm waiting each time an average of four days before ""tech support"" haha will write me back.Don't buy this."
1,Be Careful,"This product has many wonderful maps to use with a COMPUTER but BEWARE you can't load the maps onto a GPS so unless you want to carry a laptop on your next hike - skip it. The product information is misleading by stating the program has the the ability to load maps to a ""device"" apparently this does not include a GPS so I ask what's the point? What a disappointment."
1,Doesn't compare,"I received this as a gift and what a dissapointment. Magellan has a topo product (mapsend) that works well with all gps's. All in one CD. It doesn't use images for the topo, just a simple map format. This product however is very inferior and offers even less detail than the other topos plus it can't be downloaded to gps's. I am very dissapointed and I continue to try to find out what features it excels at given that it has 17 CD's. It has to do something with all of that right? As it turns out it is just a poor design that was used as an attempt to get that paper topo map feel. It seems they just scanned in all the topo maps for the US, no wonder it took so many cd's. Don't waste your money."
2,Should have read the reviews....,"Bought this at the Apple Store on an impulse and boy am I sorry. Ditto what the other reviewers said plus there's no hardcopy documentation and what is on the .pdf help file is laughable. Here's another thing, on the USGS 1:100K level, the maps consistently DO NOT line up and are often cut off. C'mon guys, how hard is it to scan in a map and line them up? If you're happy with 1:100K or 1:500K,or need a fine quality state/county map or even a road map with elevation info, then this might be for you, but don't expect to go hiking with it."
1,Quite possibly the worst software ever,"I had this software working once on an older computer, but it functioned poorly, i.e. froze up and crashed intermittantly. I recently installed it on a newer computer (Dell Dimension 9100, Window XP Professional) and it won't open a map, even after several reinstalls of the latest download from their Web site. Save yourself the trouble and frustration. Use Google Earth to get a close view, and buy good maps from a reputable source. The creaters and sellers of this software should be ashamed of themselves."
4,Mine wasn't one of them,"I purchased this book expecting to find information on one of the best old roses for a beginning grower of old roses to grow...'Marchesa Boccella' (aka 'Jacques Cartier'). It was not included. Since it's the rose I had bought for my garden, in that respect, the book was disappointing, but it is a helpful field guide to the 100 old roses that were selected by the author. If I had been able to see the list of the roses, I would not have bought it."
5,Beautiful story,"Andrews' book reminded me so much of my relationship with my mother. She has captured that special bond, that can only exist between a mother and a child, and which contains more than what usually can be told in simple words - yet that's what this book excels about. Highly recommended."
4,Save your back,"I think the blade should be sharper but it was certainly better using the sod shovel. I have been using my littlewide pick ax type thing and it was back breaking to say the least. Once I got the sod shovel started, it was comparatively much easier. But I do think it will go faster and smoother with a sharper blade."
5,Ames Co. Sod Lifter,This product is the perfect tool for sod busting. Long enough you won't break your back yet compact enough to handle easily. You may or may not need a shovel to lift the sod out of the way but that's okay. If you're doing this type of work you probably have one around. No other manual tool I've used cuts through grass and weed roots like the Ames Co. Sod Lifter. Digging is rarely pleasant but this product sure makes it easier.
5,For the customer who last posted that was wondering how to work their non-playable DVD...,"The only way you can get your DVD to work is to buy a Region 0 DVD player from the UK. In the future, if the product description says ""Non-USA Format,"" that usually includes San Francisco."
3,no rotissirie,"the grill is great, the heat takes a little practice to control. But the infrared burner and rotisserie mount are of no use if the rotisserie is not going to be available. No one including strathwood will respond to inquiries on the issue"
2,Nice grill but doesn't last,"I purchased this grill from Sam's Club in April 2005. After two seasons of use (I live in Cincinnati area so our grilling season is 4 - 5 months/year), it needed all new burners, a new cover, a new cooking grid, new ceramic heat tamers, and a new thermostat. Grand Hall sent me a quote for just shy of $300 after purchasing it for $600. For that kind of money, I expect that it should last a little longer than two years. If I wanted a grill that lasts only two years, I could have gotten one for less than $200. In my opinion, this grill is NOT GOOD VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY.When they are new, they are great; easy to use, cooks evenly. The stainless is pretty high quality. They do tend to use quite a bit of propane in comparison to our old grill."
3,Decent grill; missing assembly instructions!,"First off the box the grill was delivered with the top cover half torn off; Subsequently we discovered that the grill did not have the owners manual or assempbly instructions; after calling amazon customer service, who I have to say was prompt and polite, they were unable to provide a simple way to get this manual to me. Understandably disappointed I was lucky enough to find someone who had purchased the grill and was able to email me a copy of the assembly instructions. I have purchased many things from amazon and in general am very pleased with the experience; this was definitely a suboptimal experience; we did manage to put the grill together finally and are looking forward to using it this weekend."
4,Caution: Missing fork,"Nothing wrong with the pulleys - seem to work fine, good bearings. My issue is the forks, or should I say fork, because they only package one. Two pulleys, two axle-bolts, one fork! At first I was dissin' myself: how do you lose a brand new fork? Then when I went to do the other door and dug out the other package, I realized, they only packed one! Huh?So, either save the old fork, make one from a piece of heavy strapping like I did, or pay the extra buck or two and get two single pulley packages rather that this package."
4,good dedication to eazy e,"boy loved how kokane took morris day's classic gigalo's get lonwely too and funked it up making folkls like me remenisce abouth the glory days of nwa boy I'm a eazy fan 4 life I still bump nwa, deatherow, cube, lench mob, westside connection, above the law all of it west coast for life."
5,Satisfied Customer,"I've been using this soap for over a year, and I still love it. While it's impossible to actually reduce the size of your pores, this soap does help reduce the visibility of them. Not to mention, I've had several people ask me my secret to such a ""healthy complexion."" I use no other cleansing products in my facial routine, as this soap does it all for me. I'm very happy with it's results as well as how long the soap lasts! The price may seem steep, but it's well worth it's value as you won't be needing to replace it often."
4,"Top Product, Top Service, Top Experience",My entire purchasing experience with Amazon and the Burt's Bees product was par excellance. Very satisfied!
2,Didn't do it for me,"Works as well as any soap does. Except this stuff has a dark maroon color and thus, to me, doesn't seem like it comes off as cleanly after rinsing. The bar seems to last a while, but I still don't think it's worth the price premium over any regular bar of soap."
4,"Works well, very pleased","This soap works very well. I noticed some immediate results but understand that this is a process that takes time. With continued use I think this could solve many of my problems, without odd side effects as some other acne treatments. Is somewhat expensive, only downside, but product works so I guess it's worth it."
3,Been using for years,"I've been using this soap for years and I love it. Keeps my skin very clear. However, I think that the company has stopped making the soap because I can't find it in stores or on the Burt's Bee's website. I ordered through Amazon and the soap smells differently than it normally does. Almost like it's expired/dated or infused with a fake smell. Not sure what's going on with that."
5,So Sad,"This has been my favorite facial soap for the past six years. And now they've discontinued it. I have t-zone oiliness and dry cheeks, and this soap works perfectly. No breakouts. No oiliness throughout the day. And no harsh dry feeling after washing.So sad."
5,An excellent collection of songs,"Melanie/ Candles In The Rain (Buddah Collector's Classics CD): Woodstock had a profound influence on Melanie (she performed there, though she is shamefully excluded from the current editions of the film). This album, her first since the Woodstock Festival, contains her hit ""Lay Down (Candles in the rain)"" which she wrote in response to that experience. The rest of the songs vary from the serious to the comic, along with some fine interpretations of other's songs, and all are very good. This Buddah issued CD has two fine bonus cuts.One note on ""Lay Down"": This album has the short (under four minute) version of the song (just as it was originally released). A few years later, a hits album released the longer (seven-minute) version of the song. The longer version of the song is not part of this album. The best place to get the long version of ""Lay Down"" is from the CD ""Beautiful People: The Greatest Hits of Melanie"".I love this album so I give it five stars"
1,Phony as a $ 3 bill!,"LDS members 'Talk the Christian talk', but when it's down to cases, Loyalty to the LDS Church is their FIRST PRIORITY. Divorce against a non-believing spouse by a true-blue Mormon? That's OK! (compare 1st Cor. 7:13-14, Matthew 5:32)Hinkley had his career in the LDS PR department, and his life showed it.When WW II came along, instead of enlist or be drafted, he took a job on the railroad, whose workers enjoyed preferred status as a war-essential industry (what did he do there? was he a train crew member or some other essential part of transportation?) When the war was over, he came back to SLC.This book is FULL OF PLATITUDES, which bear little if any resemblences to actual on-the-ground LDS practices today; most everything (witness Mitt Romney) is centered around mainstreaming, 'going with the flow'.""Even a dead fish can go downstream"""
1,Hinckley stands for something alright ...,"... what total crap! Totally sappy, feel-good rhetoric spouted by the leader of the ""we're not different, we're just like you"" Mormons. Hinckley is so busy building up his multi-billion dollar corporation unto himself that he'll stop at nothing to ""pull one over on the masses."" Whatever values Hinckley espouses in his book, he's just regurgitating that which has been preached before ... no new prophecies here. Don't line his pockets with your hard-earned money to read what you already know."
1,The book for the naive,"What a overwhelming glaze of gullible thoughts from a pure idealist. So far from rational ideas of human interaction that I am not suprised by all the positive feedback from a certain religion. Gordon Hinckley has given us simply another childs book. If everyone were to act like this we would fall so far back in gullible nature that we would have to hope for our government to intervene, and I support small government. Kindness is one thing, but competition is how we became a great country. How can anyone elaborate on faith as a virtue? What kind of forward progress is human society to come to if we still rely on superstitions and beliefs. I hope this book lands in the fiction section where it belongs. I also will watch the number of reviews that weren't helpful climb, which will make my point at leadership is valid only to the blind followers."
2,Utopian idea from him?,"Gordon should live by what he states. He condones a religion that most people realize is dishonest. He has great ideas that I wish were possible. He should start with the church he leads. Honesty and integrity are what is needed and yet most of society does not know of the ills of his church. He's a ""prophet"" of God. Is that honest? His ideas on family are super, but polygamy was a perverse idea that used to be promoted by his predecessors. Only until normal society intervened did this sick tradition get stomped out. I truly wish Gordon would get his very own to act the way his book suggests. What a truly utopian idea that needs to be expressed, but he needs to start by looking in the mirror and fixing what he has control over first."
5,A book that the entire world can benefit from!,"It is always so wonderful to hear our Prophet speek. This book outlines the basics virtues that every living person should not only have, but cherish. It talks about things so simple, yet profound. I always find Gordon B. Hinckley's words to be inspirational, and there is always something new to learn. I love how he goes into little interesting tidbits about his life. I found them fun, and I learned things I never knew before. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone."
5,Words the whole world should hear,"This book is fabulous. It espouses all of the moral, ethical, and important values that everyone on this earth should take to heart. It is about common decency, and about making this world a better place. It is not a ""mormon"" book-it is book for the world. Reading this book brought tears to my eyes and made me realize that I want to live these virtues. I have gien this book to non-Mormon friends who loved it. It is fundamentally Christian. I highly recommend it to everyone-whatever their beliefs may be. It is about being a good human being."
5,Let's try not to neglect these virtues,"I was raised by great parents who taught me most of these virtues, not only by teaching, but also by example; so I know that they work. As with most people, I find myself lacking and find that I need reminders from time to time of these basic principles of happiness. Gordon B. Hinckley has done a great job of articulating and providing a compelling argument for these ten virtues. It has caused me to reflect on my life and make resolutions to improve where I need to, and to teach my children those same things. Any book that does this for me is worth reading.I also loved his discussion on the guardians of virtue; marriage and family. I agree that the secret to a great society is to have strong families anchored by a strong marriage. I strongly recommend this book for anyone willing to be reminded of such important points."
5,Raised by the Rod --the Fishing Rod,"This book is truly a great call to virtue. The author is striving to bring to mind those good things in each of our lives --the tried and true values of patience, overcoming tragic difficulties, and finding the good in life. Recommended reading for anyone trying to find the high ground in life."
5,Powerful Message,At a time when many look to the government for help it is refreshing to see there are those who still believe that happiness comes from within. I for one believe the message found in this wonderful book.
5,Timely and important,"With the prevalence of crime increasing, along with a flood of other social ills, this book is both timely and important.More than a list of good things to do to improve the lives of both individuals and our society as a whole, Gordon Hinckley draws on his years of experience to relate the effects our choices have, both on ourselves and those around us.While it may be true that many of these virtues are well known (honesty, integrity, and the like), what may not be so well known, in this day where all can cite social ills and yet accept no personal responsibility for them (but are always able to find someone else to blame for them), Mr. Hinckley tells us how to apply them in the modern age.It was this ability to take age-weathered virtues and breath a new life into them, aiding me to see them as vibrant, useful, and yes, needful, that has made this book so valuable to me.I recommend it to all without reservation"
5,Another good source of advice,"If more people followed the ideas in this book, the world would be a better place, filled with better people, and thus a more pleasant place to live!"
4,A Good Book,"I am not a foolish man. I have observed this man for many years and I have found no reason to distrust him or the church he leads(of which I am a member). I cannot understand why some people are opposed to this book being simple. It's interesting to note that society at large cannot tolerate something so plain that it stares them all in the face. Simplicity is what is needed in the world today. Trust in a higher power, even God is needed, I believe. If we rely on the wisdom of men, we will be as good as men, and we all know how that can turn out. I'm sure I'll be flamed for writing this. But I don't care. This book defends the values that have made this country what it is today, and anyone who wants to defile that is destroying this country. I did read most of this book and it is excellent; plainly written and simple enough to be applied to the rigors of daily life. Trust your heart when you read it, not these flimsy reviews..."
5,Great Book,"This is a great book. This book will touch your hearts and minds of you will let it. It is a must read for all. It is for all people, religous or not relgious. One of the best books I have ever read. In a world where virtue has been forgotten, it will increase your hope for a better change."
5,Standing for Something,"This is an excellent book which, I feel, will appeal to many serious and responsible Americans. The Editorial Review expressed here, in my opinion, is excellent. I endorse it."
5,This Book Can Change America...For Good,"I just received this book and have been thoroughly enjoying it. I enjoy it because these things are true. It has made me want to be a better person, a better neighbor, a better citizen."
5,MASTERPIECE FOR CLEANSING THE MIND OF ROTTEN INPUT,"This book is so enlightening. So many are so brainwashed. As Gordon Hinckley says in his book, ""Negativism sells."" The cure: ""accentuate the positive"" instead. This is just one example of the many solutions to common marital problems, parental dilemmas, co-worker and employee conflicts found in President Hinckley's book. I appreciate President Hinckley's courage to rebuke and his sense of humor. What a great man. This is a must purchase for all who care about being and doing good. It's a keeper to refer back to as well."
4,Great Insight,"This is a great book. Yes I am mormon so I didn't mind the religious undertones of the book, but I felt that even if I wasn't mormon I could take away some great advice from this book. This book is some light reading on how to have a better more fulfilling life. Anyone of any background can take this book and pick out some of President Hinckley's suggestions from: spending more time with the family, or serving others, etc. And apply them into their lives and see the improvements in their lives and their family's life."
5,Great book - especially the epilogue,"It is written by the President of the LDS church (Mormons), but I believe was written for readers of all faiths. There are numerous great quotes and passages and the epilogue on moral leadership should be required reading in business ethics classes."
5,Fun to read taking me back to the late 50's - liked it a lot,"Dear Amazon, It was a great pleasure to be able to find the book ""Stomp"" by Nicholas Van Pelt and re read it again, after buying it 14 years ago reading it and loaning it out to several friends, I must have given it away. The used book I found on Amazon was in excellent condition and a very good price!... The story is adventuresome, funny, and a shade risque....""but not like 50 shades of gray"" it takes you back into the the late 50's telling a story of a young man entering manhood in the small town he lived, the story goes beyond an incident of crime that he knew about, turns and comes back....the times of the story coincide with my age at that time, making it a good read. Thank You."
5,Ina May's Guide to Childbirth,"This book has proven to be a tremendous help during my pregnancy. I have read it in its entirety and have used it as a reference consistently. I will always recommend this book to any woman expecting or planning to conceive. As well, it is useful for those that are interested in the truth of childbirth. An enlightening and pleasant read."
5,Don't read this book if you're booked at a hospital for your birth,"I was merrily skipping along during the first five months of my pregnancy, dutifully showing up at the hospital for my routine checkups, somewhat apprehensive of the big scary monster that is birth, but otherwise unconcerned. And then, at the urging of a friend, I read this book. And suddenly anxiety set in - I couldn't possibly have my baby at the hospital, I knew too much. I frantically searched for a homebirth midwife, feeling like my time was running out. Luckily, I found an excellent one, and then I took Hypnobirthing classes to prepare myself for an unmedicated planned homebirth. Fast forward four months: I had my baby at home, and everything happened just as nature designed it to. I was sure of my self, had no fear whatsoever, and dealt with the pain one contraction at a time. Twenty-four hours later I had my beautiful little girl. Thanks to this book, I had the confidence to do the right thing for her and for myself."
5,The MUST READ book for Natural Childbirth,"I keep wondering why I had not read this book when I was pregnant with my first child. I did give birth naturally the first time, but still I'm learning so much about how being relaxed and joyful can make childbirth wonderful and amazing. An event to look forward to and not to dread or fear.We need to have more positive birth stories in our culture, and this book is full of them.Ina May Gaskin is the leading midwife leading the midwifery movement and natural childbirth not only in this country but, she is well received and respected in international childbirth circles.If you are remotely interested in natural childbirth, choosing a midwife, choosing to own your body and your birth instead of giving up all control to the hospital which treats everyone like a patient that is ""sick"". Pregnancy is not an illness. Childbirth is not a medical condition, it is an age old, natural, spiritual event that happens every single day."
2,"Helpful on the mechanics, but some misinformation","Don't get me wrong, I was the crunchy-granola, SF Bay Area type who was totally going to have natural childbirth, made that clear to my doctor (and Nurse Midwife!) and hired a doula. My doula gave me this book and I read it. This book is left of left, so be prepared. I developed complications with my pregnancy (preeclampsia) which became HELLP syndrome at the end. So naturally, to prevent my early demise, I was induced, and short of a C-section, I had just about every birth intervention this natural childbirth set despises so much. But, in the end, I have a healthy baby, and I'm alive. The author in this book treats complications like preeclampsia like a fairy tail. No one on the farm got it, so it must not exist!But, if you are looking for some tips on the mechanics of child-birthing naturally, and don't mind a few medical details being off, this would be your book."
3,"Some good, some not-so-good","I'm a Christian, and this book was a bit strange to me. There are some interesting stories (and pictures!) and just a general feeling of reading about a cult throughout the book. However, some of the principles presented were very helpful to me when I was in labor -- it was encouraging to read about many women who ""survived"" labor without drugs. But it seemed to make me feel a bit guilty of the fear I had before labor began. I definitely would recommend if you're looking for ONE childbirth to read, find something else. If you're going to read many other books, this would be an okay choice. Above all, hire a doula. We did with baby #3 and I really wish we would've with the first two -- it was a tremendous blessing to have a doula by our side as our helper and advocate."
5,excellent book for all mothers to be,This book is a must for all mothers to be Ina May is an inspiration to all midwives and on reading this book she has given me further insight into the natural process of childbirth and the innate power of woman to give birth on her terms will bring better outcomes for mother and baby
5,Finally a great pregnancy guide!!!,There are SO many terrible pregnancy guides out there (in my opinion) which only instill fear into the pregnant woman about all the horrible things that can go wrong when you are pregnant and make you think that pregnancy is some sort of awful disease. There are some GREAT books which teach you to trust the innate wisdom inside your incredible body and embrace the whole experience of being able to carry a child inside your body and then give birth naturally-this is one of those GREAT books. A must-read for any expecting mother or someone who is considering getting pregnant at any point in their life.....
2,Too focused on Ina May and the Farm,"I hope for a natural birth and have heard about the mainstream hospital birthing industry, etc and hope to steer clear of that, but this book still rubbed me the wrong way.At times it seemed like an advertisement for the Farm. And numerous times, stories were told about Ina May coming to the rescue. I understand that she's trying to make a point, but it was too focused on the Farm and her own accomplishments.I also found the chapter layout not very intuitive and too much of the book focused on birth stories. It was great to read some birth stories until I realized how much of the book the stories took up....like pulling teeth to get through this book."
5,EXCELLENT,Best advice for understanding and learning all your options in childbirth.Its SO great to read prior to your first birth!
5,Opened my eyes!,"I'm only 22 but from a very young age I have been fascinated by pregnancy and childbirth. I picked up this book on a whim and ended up carrying it around with me for several days until I had read every word. This book is invaluable. Every woman who is thinking about getting pregnant, even women who aren't, women who are pregnant, woamn who have had kids, nurses, doctors, doula's, midwives, and even men all NEED to read this book. This book will make you feel like your body is capable of anything and I believe one of the major factors in the increase in medical interventions now days is that woman are afraid and doubtful and to make matters worse, they have nothing to tell them otherwise. This is a GREAT read and very informative."
3,A little out for non-Mother Earth types.,"This book was ok. It feels alot like a long advertisement for her community ""The Farm"" and some of the info turned me off a bit. One story told about a dr who walked in to find a women who was having breast stimulation....her husband latched on to one side and a ""friend"" latched on to the other. That just didn't appeal to me. I am going natural but am not really an Earth Mother type. I am not going to reference back to it now that I am done."
3,Helpful book,"Although this book had some helpful information, it has alot of spiritual ""hippie-ism"" in it stated as fact. There is alot that needs to be skipped over. This is not a book you would particularly share with anyone who was not having a baby... there are alot of pictures of nude women.This book does help you understand the basics of birth, however, and teqniques to relax and get past the pain of labor. It also shows some ideas as far as different positions to get in during labor to speed the process up or ease pain."
2,"Not a ""feel good"" book for those planning a hospital birth","I purchased this book based on the myriad glowing recommendations it has received. I expected to feel empowered and informed after reading it. Instead, I'm feeling guilty about my plans to have my baby at the hospital with a physician in attendance.Part 1 was composed of stories written by women who I had a hard time identifying with (and I'm a vegetarian living in a very hippie town in the Pacific Northwest!). I found the birth stories hokey and poorly written. Part 2 left me feeling that the only good place to have babies is at Ina May's ""Farm"" or at home with a midwife. This just isn't a viable option for most women. Ina May is very clearly biased against the western medical model of maternity care. I am not in any way a proponent of the medicalization of childbirth but considering how many women in the US have their babies in the hospital (as are all of the women in my childbirth education class) where does this leave us?"
5,Inspiring Book,"This book is a wonderful inspiration for those who want to have a natural birth and want reassurance that it is in fact a safe option for many women. I got this book during my recent pregnancy and found wisdom in Ina May's words and in the birth stories. Seeing how so many women before me coped with labor and even enjoyed it gave me renewed home for my home VBAC. I even got some great tips at how to help progression and what different positions can accomplish for a birthing mother. Most of all it reminded me that birth is normal and that relaxation and acceptance is the key to a successful labor and delivery!I did get my VBAC, by the way, at home and I am so glad I did."
3,It's okay.,"A friend recommended this to me for my second pregnancy. I had a rough time with the first being complicated, with a number of issues I was terrified the second time around. The stories are great however if you aren't giving birth on the estate that all the stories are told from it kind of loses its relevance. They are empowering stories of the strength a woman has to get through child birth, but I didn't have the choice or opportunity to have midwives and a home birth. It did however help to make the decision to go for a completely natural birth, which I am so happy to have done. I'd recommend it just for the sole fact that it helps shake those fears of child birth when it's the most natural and oldest thing women have had to go through since the beginning of time."
3,"Good, but highly biased","I recommend this book for those who are considering home birth or birth at a birth center. There are so many horror stories out there about these types of births that parents who would like to choose an alternative to a hospital birth would be encouraged by this book.However, this book does make it sound as if you are endangering your baby and yourself by considering a hospital birth. It includes as many horror stories about hospital births as other books include about home birth or birth center births, including a story of the nurse who died soon after a c-section.All in all, I would like to find a book about natural childbirth that does not demonize the mainstream medical community. Until then, this book does fill a need for an informed, experienced resource for learning about alternative birth methods. Take what she says about natural childbirth seriously and be encouraged by it, but take what she says about hospital birth with a grain of salt."
5,THE Birth Book!,"If you read nothing else on birthing, THIS is the book to read! Ina May offers women a different course in birthing and makes you feel as if you and your body are capable of just about anything!"
4,"Great info, but unclear about some points.","This book is packed with info and great stories. It truly makes a woman feel empowered to give birth naturally. I especially liked the information on positions for birthing and helping shoulder dystocia.However, my only gripe about the book is that she is very anti-medical (which I know most MWs are), and she had an obvious bias in that respect to the point that she actually misrepresented a few facts. The only way I know this is that I work in the medical community and it was obvious that she was ""twisting words"" to make things sound the way she wanted. The points were rather small and almost irrelevant, so I still enjoyed the book and feel like any woman wanting to give birth naturally should read this."
5,great read!,The second part of this book is great and should be required reading for all women. The first part is good too and is meant to encourage women with real-life stories.
5,Best new birth book out there!,"As a childbirth educator(Bradley Method) I am adding this book to my required reading list. Ina May Gaskin has shed new light on our understanding of the birth process. Clear explainations for the little known psychological and physiological aspects of birth combine with pratical labor techinques and healthy pregnancy information. She is one of few authors to include Dr. Tom Brewer's pregnancy nutrition research, and other ways for women to take control of their own choices for birth. A must read for any woman who is pregnant, or thinking about becoming pregnant!"
5,Best book on Childbirth,"This is by far the best book on childbirth that I've ever read. The chapter on sphincter law is priceless and I wish that every professional in the labor and delivery business would read it; It explores cervical dialation as a sphincter process and discusses the conditions under which sphincters function optimally.For mothers-to-be, it is full of valuable, and positive information concerning the birth process and how to best work with it (or even enjoy it). Ina May is clearly an extremely knowledgable and experienced midwife. I've given birth to three babies and buy a copy of this book for every friend who is expecting - I've given away over 10 copies so far."
4,Must-Read for Natural Childbirth,"While a bit extremist at times, Gaskin's book is very helpful to those considering births beyond the medical model. The first half - full of birth stories - is uplifting and inspiring, and the information Gaskin presents is compelling. While still ""crunchy granola,"" the wealth of information in this book is not to be overlooked."
5,Best Natural Birth Book,"My wife and I loved Ina's book. We read a couple other books on natural child birth, and this one was the best. She had the most experience, and the stories she shares at the beginning of the book helped with our confidence levels. I recommend this book."
1,Save your money for something useful to the baby.,"I'm in my 34th week of pregnancy and wanted to read up on what to expect when I give birth. This book was reccomended to me, but I couldn't stand this book. Ina May pounding the messages of ""hospitals are evil"", ""Doctors are idiots"" and ""Men who aren't your husband are all clueless"" was too much. Since the book had been reccomended to me, I was trying to make my way through it (After skipping half of the ""empowering"" birthing stories in the first half of the book) but when I got to the message of ""ALL prenatal screening and tests are unecessary and postentially harmful"" I had enough. I'm returning this book to get something, anything better."
5,"A ""must read"" for all pregnant woman!","Great book for any woman to read, whether or not they plan to have a natural birth. The book eases fears surrounding childbirth through the series of birthing stories included in the first half of the book and through the author's writing. She reminds the reader that the female body is designed to have children and is not inadequate as we're sometimes led to believe. The book gave me some helpful techniques to use during my (unmedicated) labor and a better understanding of some of the medical procedures and medication often used. My sister was unable to get an epidural and I feel she would have benefited from the coping techniques provided in the book."
5,A Must Read for all Mothers-to-be!!,"I realize there are 313 other reviews on this book, so I don't really need to write a review, but I feel like I need to! I am pregnant for the second time and after an induced labor with pitocin, IV drugs, Epidural, and vaccum suction I really want a natural labor this time around! I ordered 5 books on natural childbirth, this one is the second one I have read. I feel like my philosophy on birth has completely changed! Ina May is educated and experienced, her book is well researched and warm hearted. I feel so much more capable of giving birth the way nature intended having read this book! Ina May has helped me connect to my inner mammal and has given me faith in myself as a human being and woman. I can't recommend this book enough to every woman who wants to understand her role in her own birthing experience!"
5,I highly recommend this book,I really enjoyed reading this book. I feel empowered and prepared to give birth.
5,Very informative!,"I absolutely loved this book. I do not have enough money take any $200-$300 classes so I decided to buy this book instead. I am so glad that I did. Although I will be having a hospital birth due to the lack of birth centers and lack of midwives in my area, this book had information that I can use for my natural birth in the hospital. The author is not a big fan of hospitals but I enjoyed the book because I could look past her opinions. Some people who are having hospital births may not like the book because the first half of the book talks about natural birth at a birth center. Although I will not be able to relate, the stories were very encouraging. I would recommend this book to first time moms planning a natural birth, who need encouragement after hearing so many horror stories about natural birth. This book surely helped me! :-)"
5,drop your stereotypes!!!,"this book was so helpful to me. i'm a first time mom who grew up with your basic ""get to the hospital for the birth"" kind of environment. This book was so amazingly helpful with furthering my instinct that ""birth is not an emergency!!"" It doesn't have to be a medical procedure! She gives you many reasons/ways to help make your birth as sucessful as possible, whether you give birth at home or in a hospital...without the aide of drugs and unnecessary surgeries/medical procedures. Womens bodies are more powerful then most people let on. An awesome read for ANY pregnant woman or her partner."
5,Wonderful!,"This book should be read by anyone involved in childbirth, whether you're a doctor, a midwife or mother. Ina May brings so much light into the explanation of birth."
3,Encouraging book but not that practical,"The first half of this book is just short birthing stories--which becomes very tedious to read straight through. The stories are interesting but completely anecdotal. The second half of the book gives very generalized information on natural birth. Despite being a physician myself at a university based practice, I thoroughly believe in the power of natural childbirth. This book is encouraging but honestly not really adequate in terms of the practical information. I give it 5 stars in terms of illustrating and reassuring that natural childbirth can be accomplished safely...but again only 3 stars if you are looking for a true guide to giving birth naturally."
5,"Fabulous, fabulous, FABULOUS book!!","This book is a rare combination of being an enjoyable, easy read that is also chock-full of useful and important information. The info she shares on Sphincter Law is enough for me to recommend this book on its own, as is the collection of birth stories that help to change the underlying view of childbirth as scary that we all get from our culture, as is the multiple labor coping techniques she describes. And yet this book includes all of that and more! I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Every pregnant woman should read it, to gain confidence in what her body can do!"
4,Review for Ina Mays childbirth,"This a great read for women. Some of the time I thought it sounded a little ""granola"" but I have much respect for Ina May after reading this. This book was uplifting, and reassuring about allowing your body to do what its made to do. Please skip what to expect when expecting. The info is terribe and suppressive"
5,Absolutely Empowering,"I don't typically like reading books about child rearing or bearing because it seems to be a bunch of jumbled information shoved in your face by ""professionals"". This was anything but that! I could NOT put it down. It was incredibly informative without bashing any woman and her particular choice for birthing. I felt so empowered reading this book, not only because of the wonderful stories told but because of the important information which Ina May shares. Knowledge is power! I guarantee you will not be disappointed with this book, and pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. A great book whether you are pregnant, planning to be soon, or just planning for the future."
2,Practically all birth stories,"Lot of good birth stories, essentially the entire book is birth stories. However, it is clear what her feelings are about ANY interventions. Lots of stats that will freak you out about the problems with interventions. Lots of bias out there for unquestioned Western medicine so it's good to get the other perspective. However, it is overkill if you are taking a natural childbirth class as there is nothing new."
5,should be required reading for ob/gyns!!!,This book was wonderful and I wish it was required reading for ob/gyns. Maybe they would realize more would be possible if birthing environments in hospitals were more like that described in Ina May's book. It made me want to drive to Tennessee where she & the other midwives practice in such an intelligent and caring fashion! And I live in California.
5,My favorite pregnancy book,"If you are considering natural childbirth or simply want to read something with the philosophy that pregnancy and childbirth are normal, natural processes, then read this book. The first part of the book contains lots of women's birth stories, which are interesting and enlightening. I really loved the second part of the book, where Ina May describes in detail her philosophy about childbirth and gives a detailed, well-researched and thoughtful perspective on the whole process and the role of various medical and non-medical aspects of our birthing culture. It's so inspiring, when I finally convinced my husband to start reading it he couldn't put it down. It's not too preachy, and it tells you things you won't read in any other pregnancy book."
3,Hippier than Thou,"Recommended by a midwife friend, but much more flower child and commune devoted than I expected.Led my daughter to decide against a midwife delivery. It ""creeped her out""."
2,Too Hippyish for me,I am definitely for natural childbirth to some degree. I think that natural is best but I also don't think that modern medicine should be totally ignored. This is not necessarily a bad book I just couldn't get past how these people sound like crazy hippies. Some parts were just plain creepy and semi-pornographic and I really just couldn't finish the book. I would recommendHomebirth in the Hospital: Integrating Natural Childbirth with Modern Medicinewhich advocates an even (and realistic) balance between modern medicine and natural childbirth.
2,Confused why this is so highly rated.,"Not quite sure why all the reviewers are ""raving"" about this book. First of all you can completely get rid of the first half of the book. It provided NO value at all regarding childbirth other than to tell even more ""scary"" stories which is what Ina May keeps insisting that we avoid. The second half of the book was informative but outdated. I did not walk away from this book feeling empowered to have a natural childbirth. She does not talk about relaxation techniques that you could practically use in a hospital setting. This would only be a good book if you were having a home birth assisted by ""hippies""."
2,Not very realistic for a CA mom-to-be,"This book is sweet and old-fashioned but it is all about giving birth at THE FARM with midwives. For somoeone like me who knows I will have the baby in a hospital with a doctor, though naturally, the book did nothing for me. It in fact made me feel like what I wanted to do was not good enough. Plus, half of the book was just people's boring stories, all of which were pretty much the same. If you are in my shoes, don't buy this book."
2,All Black and White?,"I read this book together with a lot of other books during my wife's pregnancy. The experience reports might be nice for people who like it (which I don't) but the second advisery part is completely unbalanced. The world is not black and white as this book wants to make you think. None of the described evils that supposedly awaits you if you choose a doctor and a hospital during your pregnancy ever happened to us so far. This might have been relevant 40 years ago but with a little knowledge and curiosity nowadays you can easily get the best of both ""worlds"" (a differentiation that put me off right away). You definitely should not use this book as your only source of information."
1,Read this before you buy this book,"This book was not a good choice for me. Its not just about natural birth, but ""orgasmic"" birth [really], kissing your partner with an open mouth during contractions etc etc. I read this book from cover to cover, as did some friends. By unanimous agreement, the book is now in my compost bin."
5,The best pregnancy book ever!,"Anyone who is pregnant or planning to get pregnant NEEDS to read this book. Fathers, too! All the information you will need to have an informed, confident childbirth. Ina May's insights are wonderful and the birth stories in this book are inspiring. No woman should have any doubts about her ability to have a healthy birth on her terms after reading this book."
5,From C-Section to VBAC,"Thank you, Ina May, for all of the courage and confidence you pass on through your written word. Without Ina May and my ever-supportive midwife, I would've been doomed to another c-section against my wishes."
4,Informative/helpful,"A totally different view of birth than what tends to saturate media, popular beliefs, etc. A very welcome alternative. I will likely read Ina May's other books!"
3,ok,"this was recommended by many and i purchased any book i could get my hands on for my TOLAC and ultimate VBAC. No reading can prepare you for the pain of labor and childbirth, and certainly every body handles it differently. not to mention, each labor, depending on position of baby, etc, will be vastly different."
3,dont expect much in the way of battlefield pics,"this is almost entirely a book of brady's portrait work, which is fine and dandy, but there is almost nothing in what one would typically think of as civil war photos."
3,BTR / Comments,The ordering process was good and so was the delivery. The tool looked fine but when it was put to use it did not work properly. It probably would work fine on a new engine but mine are 20 yrs old. THe tool was not long enough to grasp the flywheel teeth due to engine wear. The tool was machined at the shoulder to provide deeper access to the flywheel teeth and now it is being used.
1,item not like ad,"Got these in a poorly packed box. Items in a plastic unsealed container with no markings, label on them. They had fingerprints on the bulbs. Looks used not new as ad stated. Sent them back for refund. Emailed them, they said we do not sale used items. Well explain what happen. Had a detective look at them and take photos for future action if need be. Also told Amazon on how yucky this transaction was. So if you deal with this company please inspect your items real good so you do not get cheated."
3,I disagree,"3 1/2 stars really. A very well done book, but the choice of words seems all wrong. How about more words you will actually use? I love the pronunciation guides, the definitions, the quotes, but not the actual choice of words. I mean seriously, ""antebellum, bowdlerize, expurgate, moiety, and orthography."" I am a college-educated adult who has been in book clubs and who tutors all ages children and I never see or use a lot of the words in this book. What use would an 18 year old have for them?"
3,Swarovsky Crystals really sparkle in the sunlight,"I purchased this watch as a mothers day gift. my mother is 81 years old and has difficulty seeing the tick marks or dots on some of her watches. so i looked for a watch that was elegant and had arabic numerals for hour markers. This was a winner, she hasn't taken it off since i gave it to her. The swarovsky crystals really sparkle in the sunlight.Thank you Amazon."
3,Not Enough About the Muse -- Superficial,"Elgar's Tenth Muse was interesting, up to a point. However, the content was inadequate and superficial. If there had been more said about Jelly d'Aranyi, or about Lady Elgar, the DVD would have been more interesting. As it was, there seemed to be Much Ado About Nothing."
4,Works great,Excellent replacement for a miked Plantronics headset - like the flexibility of the tube and the headpiece is comfortable enough to wear long periods. Yoiu need an adaptor to make it fit in most phones - but once oyu have it all you need to do is select the headset that weems to fit best. I'd buy this one agiaain.
2,never used it,I never used it. The prongs are not what we used at work so I really didn't need it. How can return it?
2,Poor image layout,"Images print off center from example. Hallmark's parent company say they are working on patch, but nothing yet. They offer a full refund,but a waste of time to buy and then just return. Great program,but needs a good patch to fix glitch."
2,CARD STUDIO 2007,"I purchased this program for newer cards. I have found new pics and verses BUT I like to make most of my cards as quarter fold cards, and this won't do it or I haven't found a way to make it print right. the picture is not centerd on the page. When the card is folded the picture is too high. I have been folding them so the picture is centered and cutting off the excess. I makes the card a little shorter. I don't like this."
1,Unhappy Customer,Card Studio 2007 has repeated many cards from Card Studio 2006. I bought this new program to have more of a selection but was very disappointed. Also is is very difficult to see the cards when they are bunched. You have to pick a card in order to read the front. Very time consuming.
4,Way Above Expectations,"This product is great!!!! Pretty user friendly, just takes a few minutes to actually figure out the layout of it. Great for anyone who loves to make up things especially for school, church, or your own personal purposes......This product was able to do a lot more than I ever expected!!!! If you are a teacher of any sort, or just have kids at home.....this is ideal!!!"
4,Great but...,"Excellent product, but unfortunately no business cards. That would have made it perfect. The ease of use is simple. Lots of downloads available too. I really love this software, especially the E-Cards."
1,Still waiting for a fix....,"I contacted the program's customer service department when the cards in this program printed off center no matter what I did. I received an email saying that this was a known problem with the program and a fix would be available by the end of January. Mid-February I asked again about it as there had been no fix. That time they said it would be fixed by the end of February. I've used their previous programs w/out problems, just wanted more variety so added this one. Apparently not a good idea....."
3,Hallmark Card Studio 2007,I was a bit disappointed in this version of Hallmark Card Studio 2007 because it had a lot of the very same cards that were in Hallmark Card Studio 2005. The cards are great as always but I paid a lot for the same exact cards that I already had. I would not have expected this from Hallmark.
2,Not a great deal on Hallmark Software,I thought I was getting a complete package; no instruction manual enclosed and one CD was scratched. Paid full price for a supposed new version; newer version for 2008 was same amount where I live. So what's the great deal from Amazon? Never again!
3,christmas gift,This was a specifically requested Christmas gift. I have no idea how I could possibly rate it
1,Very Limited!!!,It's not possible to open the cliparts and fonts on other software.The features are extremely limited. Preview is terrible!Printing is also not good and always include a Hallmark logo.
1,i got de blooze,"good technique but suburbanites lack a genuine feel for the real deal. ah, whatnot, dudes like this can always get a gig at an eagles or fleetwood mac reunion tour."
5,GREAT CAT SITTER - GET THE DVD!,"In reference to the review by ""Sweetviolet79"", this IS available in DVD format, as a continuous loop!!!!!I bought it directly from the producer/directer/cameraman, Steve. His website is www.cattv.com. Great guy!The DVD sound and picture are terrific (for the gentleman who complained about this on the VHS tape). Two of our three feline boys were absolutely mesmerized! (The third is 16 and a little deaf. Apparently sound DOES play an important part of the movie's attraction.)I think ""Video Catnip"" is to cats, what ""Sesame Street"" is to toddlers! It's a great cat sitting device!"
4,Want to laugh until your sides hurt???,"I could not believe the response my two cats gave this video. They were so engrossed I couldn't get them to respond to my petting, pulling on their tails, calling them. They just got out of my way & went back to staring at the screen. I died laughing at their hypnotized stares at birds, squirrels & other animals & attempts to catch them. I only gave it 4 stars though, the first 10 minutes or so is a produced thing that has loud annoying music that seemed to irritate & distract my kits. Fortunately it moved on to nature sounds and natural scenes. Create a couch-potato, tv-junkie cat. Buy this video."
4,Surprisingly effective,"We have four cats, so we figured at least one of them would be interested. For the first half of the tape, they ignored it. Then something caught the attention of one of them, and soon there were four cats crowded around the screen watching. The TV is up against a wall shared with a bathroom, and one cat kept running into the bathroom to see if the birds were there. Another kept jumping up to try to get into the TV. The other two just patted the screen. A good time was had by all of them, and if we don't play it too often, they can still be captivated by it.The bad news is that I find the sound to be unbelievably annoying, so I have to wear headphones and listen to something else while the video is playing."
4,Cat Nip Video Review,"My cat loved it ... too much. When the cat started attacking the animals in the tv, I thought its time to turn the tv off."
4,Kitty in trouble!!,"The cat was so focused on the television the whole time to the point she jumped at the LCD screen and was chattering her jaws making noises. It was so great in the wintertime, since there were no birds at the feeders I put this on and gave her a fun time and excitement!"
1,ZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Bore me. My cats looked at it once to see what it was and that was the end of that. Waste of money for me, I will sell this at my flea market table for a quarter."
4,entertainment for everyone!,Our three cats were mesmerized by the movie. I think we got as much entertainment watching them as they got from watching the birds! We finally had to pull three stools up to the TV for them to watch in comfort and to be able to touch the screen. What a hoot! You might try fast forward through the first part of the video. It has music that is a little distracting. The cats really prefered just the bird sounds.
2,My Cat Had Better Things To Do,"I greatly anticipated the arrival of ""Video Catnip."" As soon as it came, I played it for my cat. Her reaction was not what I had expected it to be. She looked at it only when I held her in front of the television screen, then she began squirming to get down. She had something to eat, tended to her grooming, sat down on a shoe, and then finally exited the house through her cat door. I tried once more a couple of days later; her interest increased only a slight bit when unexpectedly, I saw her run towards the television and put her paws on the screen. For some reason, just one bird eating seed on a log and then flying off, captured her attention. Subsequently, she left the room. I lent the tape to my dad for his cat to see. His cat had the same reaction as mine did. I'm sorry I spent the (money). Now that tape will be stored in the cabinet, most likely never watched again."
1,PLEASE BE AWARE OF ALL INGREDIENTS,"I have both heard and read that this product can be helpful for many things, and I was very hopeful that this product would be able to help with my pain management, but actually ended up harming more then helping. Unfortunately the other ingredients in this product happened to be what I am allergic to. So i honestly cannot give this an honest rating because it did not help my situation. I will say PLEASE BE AWARE OF ALL INGREDIENTS when purchasing natural products. I am a firm believer that natural is the way to go, but only when fully researched."
5,One of the best damn guitar albums of this decade,"Good God, I had almost forgotten about Larry Coryell and then I heard some of this on Pandora. He's not only live and kickin' he may be better than ever. Great tunes, not a single bad solo, wonderful ensemble playing. How else is this a great album? The sequencing of the songs, closing with a delicate solo renditioon of ""She's Leaving Home"", the sound quality and production, the variety of styles. In fact that last may be the most important thing. Larry verges on some of his old fusion style but does not try to resurrect it, like the sad Carlos Santana. He shows the best straightahead jazz playing I've heard him play, but like I said I almost forgot about him. Now is the time to fix that, and look into some of his other recent music. Sorry Larry, I'm not interested in your transcriptions of Stravinsky, I want jazz, because this is great stuff!"
2,Problem with 14oz Travel Mug,"Love the 16oz desk mug and the bottle, but within a week of using the 14oz travel mug, I started to get a whiff of something verging on mildewy each time I took a sip. I started to always let it dry completely before using it again, and this helped somewhat but it still smelled funky sometimes. Now I know why. I can hear water swishing around inside the wall of the mug, I guess trapped between the metal outer wall and the plastic inner wall. Must get in there during washing. It drips out slowly if I keep shaking it upside-down, but it probably cannot dry completely, which means it's ripe for bacteria etc. So it's in the recycling bin now. But I'm glad to have the desk mug and the thermos-- no complaints there."
2,Timex T617S Clock Radio,"I like the physical appearance of the unit as alo the control buttons, but, am very disappointed in the sound quality, and forget the nature sounds. Both the AM and FM bands come through very ""tinny"", totally unlike the sound I was receiving on my Sony Dream Machine - clear, deep and robust - which gave up after being used for 17 yrs. The Timex T617S was more affordable but not worth the savings. Maybe I am just too choosy."
5,The TIMEX T617S is TOPS,"On my 3rd attempt at buying a new alarm clock I lucked onto the TIMEX T617S. It has all the right features, is reasonably priced and is logically laid out. It knows the correct time the second you plug it in and it will continue to do so. It is reliable, solidly built, non-intrusive and versatile. With longer nature sound loops it would be very near perfect."
1,Low Quality - Broke within 1 year,"While this clock has lots of good features, the quality is extremely poor. The first clock arrived broken (volume control didn't work). The 2nd clock broke with a year of extremely light use (LED display stopped functioning). Would never buy again."
2,Dissapointed with wake-up features,"I have seen a lot of remarks about the sound quality. It isn't great, but as long as it wakes me up that is fine. I am disappointed with the CD wake up function. I was somehow lead to believe that you could set the CD to random for wake up. However, you can only do this to just listen to a CD, which means you have to wake up to track one every day. Bummer. Also, I bought this because one of the product advertisers said you could wake up with the MP3 player (amazon doesn't say this, but I saw it somewhere or I wouldn't have bought it) and that obviously is not true. Overall, disappointing. If I had wanted a radio I would have gotten a radio. If I had wanted an alarm clock that only had a radio wake option, I would have continued to use my current piece of junk."
2,CD player did not last,"I bought a T617S nine months ago. My only complaint initially was that the CD player skipped from time to time. I did not use the CD player very much, but it recently stopped playing completely."
1,CD Sound Very Average,"We have actually just returned our Timex CD Clock radio, because we were so disappointed with the sound quality. It was very tinny, and once the volume was above a minimal level it would get even worse. I realize that I am not going to get Bose-like sound for a $70 Clock radio, but I had expected significantly better sound than this."
4,Good buy!,"Works fine. A little bulky, but the convenience of a combined radio and CD player is nice. The double-alarm feature is great, and I like the nature sounds. It's a good produce, and inexpensive. What you see is exactly what you get."
2,static distrotion issues,"I really want to like this product. There are many cool features. But, for those of us still in the world of CD's, there seems to be an issue with the laser. The speakers distort until half way through the cd's, then clear up. Very odd. This is my second unit. Same problem. I don't think it's the speakers. It has something to do with the laser not quite reading the early parts of cd's. Lame!"
1,Disappointed,"I bought one of these several months ago and immediately noticed that the nap timer does not work properly. Every time I press the button it toggles the alarm settings. The two functions are unrelated. Unfortunately, I didn't try to play a CD either until recently when I found out that does not work either. So this thing is on it's way out. Right now I'm looking at the Emerson iTone iC200BK. Feature-wise it's the most complete I've seen but the reviews are not very good. I wonder when these manufacturers are going to produce a full-featured alarm clock that is actually worth the money."
1,CD player crashed,"There are many features I like about this alarm clock. That being said, I have had this alarm clock for less than a year and the CD player has stopped working. Actually, this is my second one, as the first one I received arrived with the CD player already broken. Sucks. Didn't play MP3 CDs anyway."
2,Terrible Quality,"After just a few months, the speakers are not owrking properly, making the cd player a joke. The nature sounds are ok, not as relaxing as one would like."
3,Paid too much for too little,The Alarm clock is ok. The nap feature is nice and the display has a really nice dimming feature. The sound quality for CD's and the radio reception leave a lot to be desired. It is not worth the $69 I paid.
1,A piece of junk,I just bought this clock radio yesterday to replace an RCA that began to scream then fried itself. The AM/PM indicator used for setting the alarm is non-existent - it never shows up. The smart knob doesn't do anything but spin. The volume is not adjustable; it's permanently loud. A $59 piece of junk which will be returned to the store tomorrow.
5,Good value for the money,This clock radio CD has everything I need and it he sound quality is good for the price.
3,"I waited with bated breath, but.....","...not so sure it was worth the wait. I purchased this unit as a gift and had to wait quite a while for delivery. First off I noticed that there are scratches on the display area and at the top of the unit - this was supposed to be a brand new item; I'm not so sure. Secondly, the mechanized door for the CD is very slow opening and I foresee a problem with that in the future. It does play burned CDs though. The sound is pretty good, but with a maximum volume of 9, I'm not so sure it will fit the teenager's bill. The nature sounds are pretty bogus - I guess they could work for falling asleep. The style is nice, but I find the placement and size of the buttons to be awkward. The auto-time set feature is a plus. The jury is still out, but I may be taking advantage of the return policy."
1,Dissappointed with this alarm clock.,"Right from the box, one of the LCD displays did not work. It was the date so I just dealt with it. The clock controls are not user friendly in my opinion. What I disliked the most is that the unadjustable display is so bright it is almost like having a light on in the room all night. It keeps the whole room illuminated. It looks like I will have to go back to my red LCD alarm clock. Not worth the money."
1,Do not buy if you need Weekend settings!,"As others have noted, this clock radio does *not* have the 7/5/2-day programming option, which was critical to me.J&R; was nice about the return but they wouldn't credit my shipping because they say they aren't responsible for descriptions on Amazon. (I checked and the J&R; description of this clock radio is correct - no claim about the non-existent ""feature."")So in the end I was out the time and money for shipping. But I do really like the Sangean RCR-22 I got as a substitute!"
2,"Okay alarm clock, but display is really bright!","The alarm clock is average. The nature sounds have a very digital, unnatural sound to them. The radio is okay. CD player is good but makes sounds when playing, which is annoying if you are trying to fall asleep. The display is really bright. I have to put dark, translucent tape over the clock display to reduce the brightness, even though it has brightness settings, the lowest setting is still bright.Otherwise, the price is decent.I am looking for a new alarm clock, by the way."
4,Good Value,"We bought this for our baby's room so we can play music for him to go to sleep. The blue light doesn't bother him and the unit has plenty of functions (although we rarely use the nature sound feature). Big buttons make it easy to operate in dim light. The only problem we've had is that it doesn't seem to want to play burned discs. On the other hand, we can work around that because the unit has an MP3 connector. In all, a fine product and good value.Update 1/11/13: Four years later, it's still working perfectly. Simple operation such that my son can easily operate it. Couldn't ask for more."
4,VERY PRACTICAL,I was looking for a clock/radio with a CD player when I saw the Timex.I like the tall style and the dual alarm system.I also like the fact that you can play the radio all night with the alarm on at the same time without using the sleep mode.This is what I have been looking for.
3,TIMEX T167S Nature Sounds radio,"I like this for the wakeup sounds. This is the 2nd one of these we had within 2 years. The radio basically stopped working on the first one after a year; reception was 'so so'. Sound is also so so, but it's an inexpensive radio so what do you expect. Again I really like the wakeup sounds.The first radio:I have managed to get the radio to work on the first one by repeatedly removing all power."
4,No such feature!,"Great product, and solid frame. It doesn't feel cheap. The ""Nature Sounds"" aren't great, but I didn't buy it to hear low res recordings of nature. I bought it for the fact that it can do a 5-day alarm...saving the weekend for sleeping till double digits. Wrong!The product description lies! No such feature! I ended up buying this from timexaudio.com, since amazon didn't have it available. The problem was that when I double checked the product description at timex, there were only a few bullet points. When I searched for a manual, the one clock radio that they didn't have a manual for was the T617S. So I trusted amazon's product description. Never again.Other than that bad experience, I like the sound and the radio reception is fantastic. The MP3 input is just a simple 3.5 mm jack, so you can basically play anything through this.My recommendation is that if you like everything but the 7/5/2 day feature, go for it."
4,Good but not great,"I'm still looking for an awesome Alarm clock - this is a really good one, and maybe the best one out there, but alarm clocks could be a lot better. This is a bit confusing and I never know what buttons I hit on the top b/c I'm hitting them in the dark and there are so many and they all seem to be about the same size so I can't tell by feel. If I took the time to learn how to use it, I would probably like it a lot more."
3,TIMEX T617S,"I am not well pleased with this product. Controls are very difficult to figure out - buttons on back, top and front!! Peak volume on this radio is rather low. I have placed it in a bookcase on the same wall as my bed. At peak volume, this radio can not over-ride the sound of my air-conditoner. This radio needs to be out in the open, not on a shelf."
2,sounds are not soothing,The ocean sound would have been great for soothing white noise if it weren't for the squawking seagulls on top of the waves -- makes it kind of hard to sleep to...
2,Worst design ever,"The feature list on this clock radio sounds great, but once I got the it the interface is a nightmare. Non-intuitive on how to change anything but the time and how often do you do that, well quite often since the button to trigger it is up high in back where you end up accidental hitting it if you grab the top to find the controls. Sound quality is fair at best, kind of muddy. Nature sounds are phony and thin sounding. I could go on, but I think you get the point not worth it, it is now my garage radio."
1,Junk. Don't buy.,"This product has a ""smart"" knob that's supposed to control tuning and volume. It didn't work well when I first unpacked it, then it stopped working completely. Now we have one station and the volume turned way up and no way to change it. I'm online buying a new one now. THIS IS JUNK. Don't buy this product."
4,Good clock radio for the money,"I like the radio with the dual alarms. I wish you could turn the clock light off at night (although the dim feature is good). It would also be better if the blue light from the CD player was not so bright while it was playing. I had to use a CD to get decent nature sounds because the ones provided are very short sound bites and repeat too often. Unfortunately, the provider of the the ocean waves which I really wanted decided it was necessary to add seagull sounds. It sounds more like a puppy crying and I just couldn't get past that. The other sounds didn't do much for me either. So I downloaded a CD of ocean waves and use that. Luckily I have not had the issues with the CD player, thus far that have been reported in earlier review. I wish too that the alarms could be set for a pattern like weekday, weekend, etc. All in all it is a good a radio and serves the purpose."
5,Almost Perfect,Only like two of the four simulated nature sounds.There was only one sound that sounded real. Love that it stands up on my night standrather than laying flat and taking up space
2,Can't pick track to wake up to and has strange intermittent problems,"I purchased this about a month ago in order to wake up to CDs. Almost immediately it would occasionally fail to play the CD upon waking but play the alarm tone instead. So although it's definitely set to play the CD when the alarm goes off, some days it plays the alarm instead which makes it worthless since the whole point of this for me was to wake up to a CD.In addition to that problem, which I assume is a defect that would not be present on all units, it does not let you pick the CD track to wake up to - it can only start from track 1 each time."
3,A Good Deal a first,I wanted to be able to listen to my MP3 player when I dress and at night when I go to sleep. This does that. I now notice it is losing a miniute a year.
5,"Ok, I've had to change my ""tune"" on this . . . .","3/2010: After buying two of the Timex Model T612S, I decided that I was tired of the units only lasting a year before the CD player failed. As Timex seems to be the only manufacturer who makes a unit that has Radio/CD/MP3 AND Nature Sounds, I decided to try this model T617S. Right out of the box, the CD player does not work. Returns are a hassle, as Amazon will not take the equipment back; one has to send it back to the original seller, and depend upon them to honor any returns.9/2010: AFTER BREAKING DOWN AND KEEPING THE THIRD T612S SENT TO ME, I MUST SAY THAT IT HAS PERFORMED FLAWLESSLY. IT REALLY IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR (CD PLAYER, ""NATURE SOUNDS"", DUAL ALARMS). IT JUST SEEMS THAT THEIR OVERALL QUALITY CONTROL ISN'T CONSISTENT. SO, IF YOU GET ONE, AND IT HAPPENS TO BE A ""DUD"", JUST KEEP EXCHANGING IT UNTIL THEY SEND YOU ONE THAT REALLY WILL WORK."
2,dissappointing,comes with lots of bells and whistles on this thing to justify the $70 price tag. CD sound is OK if not spectacular. So why do i miss my old RCA CD Alarm clock - and don't get me wrong - that flimsy RCA thing never worked correctly from day one and by month three i had a one in five chance of the cd player working. For SIMPLICITY sake. This thing is way too confusing and not user friendly. And it plays your mp3 player but doesn't charge it - so either i plug my ipod into the wall before i hook it up to the Timex = or it's dead when i wake up. The bright lights don't bother me as much as others. My worst complaint - i go to sleep well after my wife and when you set the alarm on it it BEEPS - 2 Times!- and relatively loud. Never fails to wake my wife up on the other side of the bed while I'm setting it and piss her off. NOT FOR COUPLES WHO GO TO BED AT DIFFERENT TIMES.
2,nice while it lasted,"We purchased this for my daughter for her birthday because she likes to fall asleep to her relaxation music or to lullabies. It was never moved from her dresser or misused. We really liked everything about it and were happy while it lasted. It is now a year and a half later and the CD part has stopped working. Since we paid $70 for it when it was new, I'm having a hard time going out and looking for a new one right now after such a short time. The main reason that this was purchased was for the CD player and the secondary reason was for the alarm clock. I could've gotten a plain alarm clock much cheaper. I'm rating two stars, because it should've lasted a lot longer. I would steer clear of this one because it's just not dependable at all!"
2,the Sony is far suoerior,Reception was very weak...the radio kind of lightweight. The Sony dream machine was a far superior product.
3,"Good clock, needs a few improvements","Over this has good sound and I mostly bought it for the MP3 attach ability and what looked like a dim display. However, the display is really bright (even at the lowest setting) so if you need a clock and a nightlight you struck gold. One big annoyance for me is the loud beeping of the buttons when pushed. If I go to bed after my wife and I need to set the alarm, the beeping invariably wakes her up.The ""nature"" sounds are ok but nothing great. The CD player works fine. You have to remember to adjust the volume fopr the alarm after listening. Kinda quirky."
1,Stopped working after 1 year,"I received this alarm clock for a gift and at first really enjoyed it and waking to the Natural sounds. However, after only a year, an internal LED started flickering - very annoying at night - and then the digits on the display started disappearing. It progressed to where you could not turn off the alarm nor snooze it. I am disappointed that a $70 clock wouldn't last for more than a year."
1,Dead on Arrival,"This one failed out of the box. It was also quite a bit more complex to set up than we wanted. Button functions are unclear. To turn the CD off, for example, you have to hit a button labeled Off/Alarm Reset. Does this both turn off the CD AND reset the alarms? Who knows? You can't tell from the very skimpy manual, either. On ours, the LCD went funny with weird shapes and indecipherable characters almost immediately and the battery backup did not seem to do the job. This felt like a very quick make it in China as cheaply as possible and sell it for a huge profit kind of product. I'd stay away..."
4,Versatile Clock Radio,This radio has many of the features I was looking for.Pros: Six preselect buttons for both AM and FM. Plays CD's. Easily settable sleep timer. Adjustable brightness.Cons: Sound is not great. The CD spindle does not seem very robust. Little competition so the price is relatively high.
2,"Broke after a month, but it's a nice unit otherwise","Getting ready to send it back for warranty work. After just a month, the CD player pretty much stopped working all together. It sometimes will spin, play a little, then shut off.The nature sounds sound like they were recorded through a drive-thru speaker, then digitized and compressed a thousand times. Very electronic sounding, and everything but relaxing.Honestly, I'm pretty busy and sending this back is a huge pain in my neck.I would not recommend this unit for that reason."
3,Neat--but not if you need to pick up lower watt stations,"I bought this radio to replace a decade older Timex T478B clock radio which has many outdated features--tape rather than CD, no nature sounds, no auto time setting--but was able to pick up quite clearly the NPR station I listen to most of the time.Unfortunately this newer model couldn't do the one function I needed most--get the NPR station; not even, after I called the factory and got their recommendations to (1) attach more wire to the already 36"" antenna wire, and (2) if that failed, get a signal booster ($31 at Radio Shack) which improved the clarity but only if I held onto the antenna wire over my head and shift its position around the room.So I returned it with regrets. I'd only recommend it if the buyer is in an area with strong signals all around AND doesn't care greatly about the lower end of the dial.Meanwhile, it appears the next step, alas, in order to have CD/MP3/CDRW capability is to move way up to a Bose Wave.Too bad."
4,Just as described,I have enjoyed my cd clock radio. after reading the direction one time it is very easy to use.The dual alarm is very useful. Only suggestion I would have is Line in MP3 portion to work like the cd. You can move thru music from the radio and not from mp3 player. I would not suggest remote because that would defeat the purpose of being an alarm clock.
2,Left me cold,"For the looks and features you would think this was a good product. However after using it a few weeks, I find this product confusing to use, and defective. The alarms go off at all times of the day I can't figure out how to turn them off, so I set them for noon. Non of the buttons that you need are lit, only the big volume knob so you fiddle with it in the dark. Sound from the speakers is also a little weak."
1,Sad experience,"I looked far and wide for a clock radio with sounds for falling asleep and CD player. Was excited that this was the one. Was a Christmas gift for my wife. Sadly this was a major disappointment. The sound from the speakers on FM stations was defective - scratchy, as if speakers had been ""blown through"" with high intensity music. It was not an issue of FM reception. Initially, CD player was working, but exhibited same problem with sound quality from speakers. Then it stopped working altogether. I had to return item to the 3rd part seller (at my expense!). Although I asked for replacement, they simply gave me credit through Amazon. I guess they also don't have confidence in the product. The radio has a nice concept and design. Too bad quality control is not there. I would suggest don't bother with this product. I had seen another bad review but decided to risk it anyway. No dice."
1,Misleading Name and Image,"The name ""Drop Stop BULK Wine Pour Spout"" paired with the image of what looks like at least 5 individual Drop Stop packages (which I know only include two) made me believe that I'd get the Drop Stop Pour Spouts in BULK.Indeed, no. It is just a single package, with just two little mylar circles. The product works great, but I got a pack of about 10 of these at the Container Store about 5 years ago for about $4.99, so paying this much for two makes me cringe.Be warned."
4,Works great!,"These are exactly what we were looking for. We use them for other bottles, not just for wine. The only thing I wasn't pleased with, was that it stated ""bulk"" in the description - we only received a pack of 2. I don't consider that to be bulk. Otherwise, the product is great."
1,Piece of junk,Not sure how the list price of these could be more than $1.00? Looks like two circles of tin foil that you have to roll up yourself and put in the wine bottle. Don't know how this is a clever design. It's more like an extremely cheap design. Would not recommend.
2,Not Memorable,"Sorry to say that I found this book uninteresting and therefore disappointing. I read it from beginning to end, but without much caring about the characters and what happened to them. In addition, the plot simply wasn't believable. An odd mix of reality and fantasy: or at least it feels that way."
4,Not Artemis Fowl but FUN!!,"My kids are big fans of ""Artemis Fowl"" and ""Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches."" My youngest is always read or re-reading one of the books. I picked up Half-Moon thinking the kids would devour it, but they didn't (at least not at first). I read it and it reminded my of an old Columbo detective story with a bit of Encyclopedia Brown thrown in. As an adult, I thought it was a good story for kids and quite fun."
4,Half Moon,"I loved this novel, it was typical young adult, adventure, clean fun. Half moon is a strange little character but it makes him appealing and the story believable. I could see this made into a disney movie. I am probably at 4.5 stars, but that is not possible, it is not as good as the books I have given 5 stars to, so I had to give it 4."
5,definitly a must,"this book is definitly one of the best books I have ever read. it is VERY interesting and it as always finding ways to keep you wanting more. And for everyone out there who loved this as much as I did, there is always the tv program. I prommis it won't dissapoint. happy reading :)"
3,Good,This book is pretty good. The ending was a nice tie-in and the plot was well developed. I recommend this book to anyone who likes any kind of mystery novels. Enjoy!
4,Another Fun Read,"Once again Eoin Colfer transferred me away from my mundane daily routine. He transports you to another world. This was such a ""fun"" read and at the same time quite thought provoking. Characters within are quite wonderful and carry their own bit of ""baggage""."
4,Great CD for Any Collection!!!,"Time after time this CD has been a blessing to me! Every song has its good and perfect place on this project! When I get to ""Everything You Are,"" all I can do is cry because I know that everything I need, I find it in Jesus Christ. If Jason never sung another song in his life, he SUNG THAT ONE!!Chris in Houston"
4,Condition of Book,"The book was indeed in the condition that was stated by the seller, ""very good"".I was quite relieved."
5,Right switch first time.,"The explanation of switch assured me I was ordering the right type. Easy install and great price, all that plus fast delivery made this a great bargin."
4,"Protects better than most, but there's one problem.","I ordered this skin for my ipod mini because I felt like it was the best on the market when it comes to protection, and it is. The rubber side bumpers make you feel safe that your ipod will be okay if you happen to drop it, and the durable rubber outside definately keeps your ipod safe from scratches. It's also one of the only skins on the market that comes with a built-in hard plastic guard for both the screen and trackpad. All of these things ultimately convinced me to buy this item, and I love it for protective purposes, but I can't hook up my itrip if the skin is on. The rubber bumpers don't allow the itrip sit flush with the ipod...therefore everytime I plan on using the itrip I have to remove the skin. If you don't plan on buying and using an itrip then I HIGHLY recommend this skin, but if you do want be able to broadcast your tunes to a radio, and plan to do that often, then I would look for something that isn't so bulky. =)"
3,"Lovely, but...","...be prepared to either order a half size up or a wider width, or endure some agony for awhile. These have taken a long while to break in, and still, they didn't give much. I am consistently a 10M, and I really need a wide or a half size up in these. They look fantastic, though, and I truly love them. I just wish I didn't have actual gouges in my heels after only 4 hours of wear the first few times I wore them. Ouch. And they still hurt after awhile, although the damage to my feet is now minimal."
4,Nice Shoe,"I purchased this shoe in the gray suede, but had also previously bought it in the tan patent. This is a comfortable and nice looking shoe. The gray is nuetral enough that it matches different shades of gray quite well. The one thing I don't like is that the heel is made of black wood. I would prefer the heel to match the shoe. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this shoe. Anne Klein shoes are always classy and classic."
3,for the period,when i first saw this i was a child. my grandma bless her was an influence. well at least 3 or more decades have past. but the suspense and the music the darkness.also the humor of watson and of sherlock to those around him who didnt see as he saw and what he himself didnt see. to me mr. rathbone and mr. bruce will always be the ultimate of what sir arthur conan doyle had in mind as the sleuth of logic reason and deduction. and his boswell ever faithful friend. rj
4,classic rock,"This cd is not that bad it reminded me alot of telsa.The ballad sounded a lot like signesThe highlights of this album are ,save by grace ,roll the boys over ,and take the money and run, not the steve miller band version.This cd does not have anything you havent heard before but its good enough to go out and get"
5,Surprised!,"I bought this book on a whim at a small bookstore in Sutton's Bay, Michigan. I couldn't stop reading it once I started. It is fully of all sorts of fascinating little factoids. Unfortunately, it only covers the northwestern lower peninsula counties. I encourage Mr. Jolly to continue with similar almanacs dedicated to the other 4 regions of Michigan. Highly recommended."
3,"Engaging entertainment, but could have been richer & deeper","This movie was more tame and approachable than its subject matter seemed to indicate it would be. I guess that's a good thing if one just wants a bit of well-crafted entertainment or a pleasant diversion. But I was somewhat disappointed that this tale of a homeless man with a mental disorder making his first tentative steps back to the real world (to solve a murder, no less) steadfastly refused to enter challenging, art-house territory and was quite content to emulate the formula of a feature-length ""Murder, She Wrote""."
4,Sam Jackson is wonderful!,"The great thing about DVD and movie rentals are to be able to catch those gems that were here this morning, gone this afternoon from the movie theater. This is a can't miss film from Kasi Lemmon (Eve's Bayou) starring Sam Jackson as Romulus Ledbetter, a former Julliard trained musician who has been driven to the streets due to mental illness. He discovers a ""valentine"" in the form of a dead body that was left outside of his cave on Valentine's Day and sets out to track down the killer.The movie just rumbles along with plot twists, the mental images are beautiful and the movie is a thriller to the end.I was disappointed with the deleted scenes. It would have been nice if the director could have let the viewer know why the scene was deleted and what the relevance was.There is a short cast and crew bio that is pretty nice and of course the director's commentary."
2,"Casting is great, but the movie doesn't really work","This is the story of a schizophrenic homeless man who went to Julliard and solves murders. Not exactly the usual stuff. The plot is just too strange and contrived for it to work, but the acting is excellent. Samuel Jackson is the homeelss guy, and manages to make an unbelievable person believable. (Jackson is one of those actors who can do just about anything)More suprising, though, is Anthony Michael Hall; who would have thought the essence of 80s geek, adolescent division, would turn in a fine performance as a Gucci-loafer-pinstriped-suit yuppie lawyer? In fact, an interesting change would be to have them swap roles. Take the pinstripes and the Guccis away from Hall and give them to Jackson, and dress Hall up as the crazy homeless guy, rags and all. I can't imagine Hall in dreadlocks, but it might work! They might even manage it."
2,I FELT NOTHING FOR THE CHARACTERS... MEDIOCRE,"After watching ""Caveman's Valentine"", I realize that Samuel L. Jackson is an amazing actor. I have to give credit where credit is due. He tried so hard to make his character believable, but it didn't work. Granted, it wasn't his fault. He did the best he could with a weak role. The script didn't exactly help him out one bit and the pace was slower than it had to be. I hated everytime he would go into one of his ""crazy spells"" and see lights and other things that were not there. Everything had a believability factor of ZERO. This is one of those movies where you don't really root for the ""bad guy"" or the ""good guy""; you don't root for anyone. By the time the movie was over, I didn't care for him or any of the other characters. I just wanted it to end."
2,"Good Acting, but Not Believable","There are some very effective moments in this strange story of a homeless man who solves a grisly murder, but they are due to the fine acting of Samuel L. Jackson in the lead role. His part - that of a Julliard trained (!) schizophrenic homeless bum - is, to put it midly, unbelievable. In addition, there is a wealthy New York lawyer, played well by Anthony Michael Hall, who is called Pinstripes by the sarcastic homeless man, but responds to his request for clothes by inviting him to his Manhattan condo as his guest, and gives him a suit and tie (!!). Huh?"
2,Lifeless,"Like most everyone who saw EVE'S BAYOU, I eagerly anticipated the arrival of Kasi Lemmon's follow-up film. Unfortunately, very little of what made EB such a critical and commercial success is evident in CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE. Not even another winning performance by Samuel L Jackson could save this pretentious clunker of a film. The book on which this screenplay was based is ludicrious enough, yet it seems like Lemmons to go out of her way to make the unbelievable premise even more ridiculous. There was simply no motivation for schizophrenic Romulus to become a crime fighter and there is simply no dramatic pull to keep the audience interested. Nothing in this film is firmly grounded, giving the one dimesional characters no where to go. What a waste of time."
1,Worst performance,"I am a genuine fan of Samuel Jackson - his recent fims such as Coach Carter and In my Country have proved his undoubted versatility as an actor. So what on earth induced him to get involved in such a trashy film - and to allow himself to be directed in such a way. His acting is atrocious, as is the rest of the film - feeble script, dismal cinematography and a complete bore. Sorry, but this had to be said !"
4,A good adaptation of the book,"There were many things missing or different from the book, but what movie adaptation is perfect?... Samuel L. Jackson was wonderful as Romulus, and the story made a good movie. If you enjoy the movie, you should pick up the George Dawes Green book -- same author as The Juror, also adapted into a movie starring Demi Moore and Alec Baldwin.Also, on the DVD's ""Deleted Scenes"" section there is a WONDERFULLY choreographed scene with Rom's ""moth-seraphs"" which is just amazingly beautiful to watch! It's too bad they cut it from the movie, but be sure to take it in when you're going through the Bonus Features."
2,carry a towel,This carafe looks good and will keep beverages hot or cold but it has a tendency to run down sides when pouring. I would not recommend it.
2,Funny?!?!,"The book was more sad and pathetic than funny. The narrator first mentions that the street is more to him than a slum (what it looks like on the outside) as if by the end of reading we would learn to love it too. But by the end of reading Miguel Street, the street seemed more like a slum than before and it seemed like the only thing to do was to get out of it and move to the West instead of try to make it better and everyone in it that tried to make it a better place to live ended up a lot worse than they had been in the first place. Where's the humor in that?"
4,Classic Humor,"While I would agree that The New Yorker cartoons in this book could have been better organized and that the introduction was inconsequential, there are many classic cartoons in this volume that are well worth the price of admission. In my collegiate youth, I lived for my weekly New Yorker, just to read the cartoons. I found many old friends in this book and was grateful to be reaquainted with them."
4,"Great, but sensitive skin beware!","I really like this product except for one thing: it turns my face hot pink! No itching, no burning, great moisturizing, but again hot pink!"
3,Fascinating,"I found this book entirely fascinating. Sure, it's old, out of date and, due to the date it was written, somewhat inaccurate, however, it did expand my mind and made me want to learn more about black holes. One of the reasons I wanted to learn more about astronomy. Overall, for a beginner, a good read."
4,great deal,I was very pleased at my recent purchase. The book was in great shape and arrived quickly. You cant beat the prices. I would order from here again .
5,Great books,"I enjoyed the entire set of Abram's daughters books. I have actually read them twice, and enjoyed them both times."
4,One person gives so much,The second book of this series is good. I feel for Leah and ask myself if I could do as she has done. The surprise is at the end of the book and makes you wonder whats next
3,Works OK for light use,"I bought this one to replace an older Panasonic single-blade shaver. That one had worked very well for a few years so I stuck with Panasonic again. But I'm pretty dissapointed with this new one. This shaver doesn't work well other than for light use, daily usage. If you skip a day it will take many many passes. Even on light use it take's more passes than my old single-blade did. The price was great but I may be looking for a replacement already."
4,Panasonic Shaver,Product was delivered on time. Product worked very well. Will buy again Panasonic products from Amazon or other sources.
2,Get what you pay for,I wish id have spent more money and got something other than a foil-type shave. Doesnt do a close shave. This was the first electric shaver ive purchased. Not even close to shaving with a cream and a dispsoble razor.I wouldn't purchase again.
5,Excellent,"Excellent value for the price.To be honest, I didn't expect I would be so happy with this purchase, because it was very inexpensive.I highly recommend it."
2,Disappointing shaver,"I can't recommend this product. While I think Panasonic makes great shavers, this is not their best example. It's good quality and it does a fair job, but it doesn't shave as good as I think it should. Explanation: I'm not someone who needs to shave everyday. I have light colored facial hairs, so I usually go 3 days before I use this electric shaver. It always ends in frustration because I have to do so many passes to get a good shave. Perhaps 2 blade razors like this require that you shave every single day? Because they just don't do much about the longer hairs. I have found that it's only Panasonic's triple (3 blade) shavers that do a good job on my longer hairs. So I'm going to spend the additional money on a triple blade unit."
4,great inexpensive shaver,Have always had good luck with panasonic products and although this ischinese made it is of reasonable quality for the price and shaves well. Light weight and great for use in shower.
3,So far it seems ok,"My first comment is this: it smells like coconut. Not my favorite smell, but it's definitely not overpowering, and it disperses pretty quickly. From the other reviews I was expecting an aroma of dead fish or something. Nothing like that. I bought this serum to use on my forehead, which is starting to show fine lines and slight sun damage. So far I have not noticed a huge improvement there; however, I have also been using it on the backs of my hands, which are often uncomfortably dry and rough, and I noticed a big improvement immediately. I would also add that this product should not be used on chapped, raw, or blemished skin, as it stings like the devil."
2,Not a good product,"This is a very oily serum that leaves a thick & shiny residue on your face. In other words, it's definitely not recommended for combo skin types like myself. The serum also smells very bad in a chemical sort of way, and the smell lingers for several hours...ick.This is an honest (albeit negative) review, and I hope Amazon prints it for the sake of fairness and honest representation to consumers who might be interested. There are much better hyaluronic products available - sorry to say."
3,They changed the formulation and it irritates my face.,"I discovered this brand about seven years ago and started using it every day. I loved it and recommeded it to all my friends. When they came out dwith the hyaloronic acid serum I started using that as well, because the winters here in Maine can be brutal. All was well until they added a fragrance that totally irritates my skin! Bad move, guys. I won't be buying it again."
3,"Okay, but not great.",For me it seemed a bit sticky and the smell is almost fruity. Not my favorite hyaluronic acid product.
2,Smelly,"Be prepared for a very strong odor -- like rotten eggs with strong cheap perfume. If you are willing to put up with the stench, the results are amazing."
2,So So & Do not like the Scent,"I have purchased this product since I've hearing that Hyoluronic Serum really benefits your skin. Anyway, when I used it for the first time, I didn't like it so much. First of all, the serum was too thick (I thought it would be more like water based serum). It's thicker than Bio-Oil. Second, I absolutely hate the scent. I can't even tell what scent it is. It has that thick old wood/w/e scent to it. Either way, it gave me huge migrane (I'm very very sensitive to scents, I don't use perfume nor get near a person who uses perfume. I also avoid going to Yankee candles). Howere, since I purchased it, I use it on other body parts where I wouldnt smell so much, such as my abs, legs, etc...(just away from my face). Overall, hyoluronic serum suupose to hydrate your skin to the maximum....from what I have heard."
3,The smell is horrible!,"I can't say if this product works because of it's smell. I couldn't handle the scent and washed my face right away. If you are sensitive to scent, stay away."
4,Best Kept Secret,"While receiving one of the finest facials I have ever received in Paducah, Ky (of all places), I was introduced to this product and have been using it ever since. That was 3 years ago and, although I am 64 years old, I don't think my skin has changd at all except to be improved. I have recommended it to my daughters and younger friends as well as my own age group."
5,Tha Stuff,"This is the ""fountain of youth""....don't be fooled by Hydroxatone!!!! Source Naturals are better, more economical and heal the occasional ""break-out"" rather than causing it as Hydroxatone does!!!! Tha ""Shiz-nit""!!!!!!"
1,Very disappointed,"I had heard great things about Hyaluronic Acid and really wanted to try it. I chose Source Naturals because I had heard good things about their products. I read the reviews before I bought this and did see people complain of the smell. I figured it wouldn't be to bad and the product was worth trying. I was wrong. The smell is overpowering. If you use this try it on your hands first, not your face like I did. If you don't like the smell it will not wash off or fade until it has run its course. I was so frustrated I could not get the smell off. My husband commented on it when he got home and walked in the door, he thought it was nice. However, after being in the same room with me he thought it was nauseating. I had only used one pump."
1,Super stinky,"I tried it and just couldn't continue using it. It has a sickeningly sweet smell no matter what I do. The product can be irritating but if put on after splashing your face with water and a little moisturizer, it's fine. I wanted to keep using it but I just could not get over the smell. I don't know if this is with every manufacturer. If the nature of the liquid is smelly. If it is, I'll have to use other products. So yes.. it works.. No, I won't use it because of the smell."
4,Great product,I liked this product. It smoothed my skin and tightened it. You only need a little to make your skin look beautiful.
5,Beauty product,I am using Hyaluronic Serum for about one month and love how my skin feels.It is inexpensive next to other face creams i have used and comes in a little pump bottle .I will continue to get it and i do recomend it.
1,Not for Sensitive Skin,"I used this product until the bottle was gone, hoping my skin would learn to tolerate it. Unfortunately, my skin never learned to, it burned and irritated my skin every time I used it. I have used another similar serum from NOW that worked great and didn't burn. I didn't notice that this serum was beneficial to my skin, but it may be that my skin is just to sensitive to tolerate it. I have somewhat dry, extremely sensitive skin and I only use natural or organic skin care products because I have less bad reactions to them. I would advise anyone with sensitive skin that they might want to avoid this product."
4,Temporarily plumps up the skin,"This is the second product I've purchased from Source Eternals (the first is their DMAE lotion), and I really like what it does to my skin each time I use it. The key thing to remember about hyalauronic acid serums is that the plumping effect is just temporary; they draw water into the skin, temporarily filling out lines and wrinkles.This SE serum works well, and I like that it also includes DMAE, which temporarily relaxes wrinkles, too. It does have a strong pina colada-type smell, but it dissipates pretty quickly, especially if you just use the recommended few drops. Even my husband, who doesn't usually like the smell of pina colada, has said that I smell good right after I put it on.If you also have sensitive skin, this will burn the first few times you apply it, so start with a small amount. You really only need a few pumps to cover your face and neck.Overall, this is a good product to use to attract moisture into the skin during dry times of the year."
2,Smell turns me off,I barely use this because it has a strong sweet food smell....can't put my finger on it. I don''t like smelling (like) a bakery!
4,oh yeah,I like this product. I did not find it that oily as I have in other brands of this product.I use this with a DPL light and it works well. I am 58 and people think am in my early 40s.
3,see-through thin fabric,"it's pretty, but really thin fabric. the pattern does hide spills well though!"
3,Relatively well made but missing screws to put it together.,"This is a relatively well-made device for holding firewood. However, it would have been nice to receive enough of the needed screws to put it together. It is sitting in my garage, unassembled because of the lack of screws. I should not have to go out and buy them."
4,Great for the money.,Sturdy but rather small. Probably holds about 1/4 cord of wood. Not sorry I Bo Guthrie this just wish it was a little bigger.
2,Rather flimsy,"This log hoop works, but it is really flimsy and not at all the 'tubular steel' strength that one imagines when seeing the picture. It screws together in pieces and just seems, well, like some cheap metal log hoop. We have an older, smaller one that is strong, forged steel and will outlast the new log hoop by decades."
4,Wood holder,The Tubular steel log holder was bigger than i thought but worked out also was kind of a pain to put together but i loved the free shipping
1,pain in rear to put together,not something to be bought on line . and what a pain to put it together.next time will buy in tsc or other related store.
1,Brian in Maryland,This was a horrible purchase and I would never recommend this product. It was cheap which I expected but that wasn't the problem. The holes would not line up making assembly impossible. Buyer be ware...
2,Different Product - Assembly Issues,"Like noted in other reviews, the item I received is not the item pictured on Amazon. It's close enough, however, so that's not why it gets 2 stars. The low rating is due to the fact that there were no holes drilled in the ""U"" piece (noticed someone else had the same issue) which means I'll have to drill them myself. I'm at a loss as to how the manufacturer could neglect to have holes drilled that are necessary for the assembly, but it's extra time and effort I'll have to spend for this to work."
3,wood holder,"a little uneven looking when you put together but holds the wood very well and looks decent, thats all i could ask so it gets the job done"
1,not happy,the description doesn't say anything about having to assemble this thing yourself. it is very cumbersome and difficult to assemble (i've assembled lots of furniture in the past). It also does not look like to photo. this thing is UGLY. very displeased.
2,Firewood rack,I was disappointed that my item had been previously used. It was assembly required & some screws were missing. One of the links creating the metal circle was slightly bent making it impossible to match up screw holes. I come from a resourceful family & had a brother who was able to fix it. I had to wash mud off some parts. Now it looks great on my front patio. For such a cheap item I got what I paid for.
1,Doubly Disappointed,"While the product in the photograph has a simple and attractive base, the product as delivered has a completely different design for the base piece. As other reviewers have mentioned, the product is basically impossible to assemble without either a drill to make your own holes or the strength of a giant to bend the existing bars to fit. It seems I will have to follow the lead of another reviewer who simply left the final screw out. I would never have imagined it was necessary to read the reviews before purchasing such a simple product."
4,Does the job,"I purchased this log hoop because my parents were getting rid of their wood since they decided to convert to a gas fireplace. I decided to get a firepit and make use of their wood, so I needed a place to store it all. It was a bit of a pain to put together because the hoops did not line up right, so my husband had to help me. All in all, the price was reasonable and it does the job, so I would recommend it."
3,Strange product,"OK here is the deal. The product does not look like the picture. In fact the picture on the box is the same as the picture here on amazon but the product actually looks like this.....http://www.amazon.com/Uniflame-W-1881-40-Inch-Diameter-Tubular/dp/B002LZUMFA/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid;=1320929571&sr;=8-6Not a big deal to me, what annoyed me is that the 2 U shaped legs were missing all of the predrilled holes to assemble the product. I think im going to drill them myself to avoid the hassel of returning and exchanging the product. As far as assembly goes its really not hard at all. I dont know what these other reviewers exepect but there are 10 parts and its a very simple design so im not sure why people are having so much trouble putting it together."
4,Great Item,"This is a great rack for inside the home. I would have given it 5 stars had it not been for the fact it came with no hardware,which was promptly mailed to me."
4,Could have been WIDER for best use,"If this was a tad wider, it would hold two rows of 16"" logs. As it is, only one will fit. No problems with assembly, however."
5,excellent buy,My husband put this together in about 10 mins. I was apprehensive about buying it when I read some of the reviews about how difficult is was to put together. Definitely wasn't a problem. This is a great buy for the money.
4,Good emergency light,"First thing is to not expect this flashlight to replace a regular battery-powered light (especially something like a Maglight).With about two minutes of vigerous shaking I get about 2 minutes of bright light (but still nothing like a Maglight), 10-15 minutes of ok light (enough to read by or get around a room), and then the rest is not so useful. I've read other reviews that say it improves with use. I've gone through about five charge/discharge cycles so far.The shaking seems to take far more effort than the cranking I've used on other generator lights but I suppose it may prove more durable and it is water proof which is nice for changing a tire in the rain.It is great for the car or to have around the house as a light that will always work but so far it doesn't seem useful as a replacement for a regular flashlight."
2,disappointing,"I just returned from a camping trip. It performed as advertized except it underperfromed verses an other LED no battery shake flashlight someone else brought. It did not hold the charge as well. It was twice as expensive, much heavier, and larger. It had a much less focused beam. It requires a lot more work to get useable light. Two quick shakes and the other one worked. The only advantage is this one seems more durable. However both got dropped and both continued to function."
3,Newfoundland to Florida Highway,"This movie is more like a filmed personal diary. Not HD and mediocre cinematography, but for the hardcore motorcycle enthusiast, a good way to do a bit of arm-chair travel. This movie will never rival ON ANY SUNDAY, but two wheel travelers will find it entertaining."
5,Brutal,This band just flat out rocks my world. This album is very raw and just all around sweet. Pick it up.... now!
2,A different opinion,"So since this is only one review written for this I thought I would give all of you would be buyers a second opinion. This band is completely talentless they can't string two words together let alone guitar, rythmn, and vocal parts. The vocalist seems like he is trying too hard and the guitarists seem like they had just started learning how to play a guitar while in the progress of making this album. Basically the only people who really like this album are burn-out stoner metal fans and those fans of metal who refuse to acknowledge that death metal and metalcore are dying breeds of the metal scene. The only reason that I gave this album a 2 star review is because some of the songs possess some pretty memorable breakdowns however that does not even begin to save this band."
2,"Predictable Plot, Clunky Construction, Cardboard Characters","I had high hopes for this mystery that features an amateur sleuth who is a physicist. But the plot of this story, presented in awkward fashion, is almost entirely predictable. I had figured out the the whodunit by halfway along. Added to this was a really clunky set of side-stories, not the least of which is the not-at-all believable story of the diagnosis and treatment of the cancer of Matt Gennaro, detective Gloria Lamerino's love interest. Dialog is creaky, characters mostly cardboard. I had to force myself to read to the very end, hoping futilely that I hadn't figured out the denouement, that there might be a surprise awaiting me. Alas, that was not to be.I have not read the earlier Gloria Lamerino mysteries and I suspect I won't be looking forward to the next one.Scott Morrison"

2,You get what you pay for,"Ordered this to replace a dead fan, got it, installed it, have it currently disconnected. There was no included hardware (screws), so I had to salvage some from my spare pile, but aside from that -- installation was easy. It is a very loud fan, however. Good air flow, but loud (I can hear it from two rooms away). My motherboard is having some (other) issues at the moment, so the box is open with only a CPU fan cooling it for now. For some reason the machine won't complete boot-up with this new fan juiced from the motherboard. I don't think it's related to this fan, though."
1,I wish I'd read these reviews before reading the book....,"I found the actions of the characters in this book totally unbelievable to the point of being annoying. This really got in the way of what could have been an enjoyable book. The corker for me was when Mark and his daughter visited one of the shops in town and he let her wander around the store on her own... after noticing that the town pedophile was also there. Come on, what parent would do that? Just the fact that this man kept ignoring his child through the entire story turned me off."
1,Boring!,"I didn't like anything about this book. There was no suspense, the characters were boring and unlikable. Even the main character was annoying. Don't bother with this one."
1,How Bad Did I Hate This Book? Let Me Tell You...,"I *never* skip ahead in books. It seems like cheating. But after about 50 pages of wading through unrealistic situations, emotions (or lack thereof), and characters, I'd had enough. The protagonist was an idiot, the peripheral characters were all completely cartoonish, and everything moved too fast with not enough exposition. I skipped all the way through to the last 30 or so pages and then pieced together what happened from the ""let's spell it out for the dummies"" finale. The main reason the book rubbed me the wrong way is because I have a two year old, and the thought of the idiot protagonist allowing his 7 year old daughter into any of the situations they found themselves makes me ill. Yes, I know it's fiction, but eeeeeuuwwww. Why would anyone even want to write that stuff down?"
1,Unbelievably trite.,"Nothing personal Mr. Fox, but I wish I had checked this one out of the library rather than fork over $8 for the paperback. The story line itself was good and could have been better developed. That the story itself occurred over a period of just days was not realistic. Also extremely unrealistic and offensive to me were the conversations of supposedly intelligent and caring adults in the presence of a child. With some oversight, this could have been an exceptional book. As it stands, I was extremely disappointed in it and continued to read it only to punish myself for having paid $8 for it."
2,"Please, take a writing class!","This is the first book by Mr. Fox I have read, and while I admire his ability to imagine such a plot, he could use some help writing it down. Perhaps a better editor?The characters are poorly drawn with no real explanation of their behavior. The main character flies of the handle with little provocation, acting like a hormonal adolescent. He is supposed to be such a great father, but his daughter mostly gets pushed aside as he indulges in juvenile behavior.I was interested in finding ""who done it"" but it was a real chore to wade through the writing to find out. I skimmed a lot."
1,"This book sounded very interesting, but failed to deliver.","I would like to assure Lee Gruenwald that I read the right ""When the Wind Blows"", not the title by the same name of a different author & I still don't like it. I thought the premise sounded intriguing on the jacket, but was extremely disappointed in it. Like other readers have reported, it is over long & the main character very unappealing. It would have seemed much more likely that he would be puzzled by all the revelations about his past than angry. The concept of the ""town gone bad"" with all those citizens & police in a virtual conspiracy against the outsider is pretty ludicrous & unbelievable, too. To me, this was a bad,bad book, not worth spending time reading. I won't look for other work by this author, that's for sure."
2,Most Whiny Protagonist Ever,"With some good editing, Fox has promise as a writer. I must say, though, that the main character of this book is the least likeable, most whiny man I've ever come across in print. But not a man you ""love to hate"" ... just an annoying person in general. Thank goodness that the bad guys were so very bad, or I would have been rooting for them."
4,Stunning page-turner,"I'm more of a reader of thrillers like Clancy stuff or historical fiction like ""The Hundred Days"" or ""The Triumph and the Glory"", and rarely read mysteries. But I found Zahchary Fox's ""When The Wind Blows"" so stunning in concept and striking in execution that I may become hooked on the genre. If all mysteries are like this one I've been missing a lot of enjoyment. The sudden phone call, the new town, the strange reactions of the townspeople, what an intriguing storyline! Fox is a genious."
3,The plot was good but the storyline lacked excitement.,I thought the writing to be a little juvinile. I never forgot I was reading a book. There was too mush repitition of the facts to every new character without any reason.
5,Should be a tourism promotion for Palau - I want to go!,"This could be a tourism promotion video for Palau, especially if you are a diver.An excellent description and video of many types of corals - and footage that is hard to find: corals eating and reproducing (sexual and asexual). (With some music that makes you think of people hitting on each other in a Jazz bar!)They show sponges and many other invertebrates. Some of the best footage is of the jellyfish, which has a mutualistic relationship with algae. As you watch you can only repeat: wow.This is a very good illustration of a coral reef biome and mutulistic relationships (cleaner fish and sharks, jellyfish and algae, and others).It is strongly narrated."
5,Sweet edition to the Berenstain Family,The Berenstain books are some of my 4 year olds favorites. She loved this book - who wouldn't love little Honey Bear? This would be a great book for those bringing home a new baby!
3,Cute but a little negative,"My adopted older daughter is 3 and we have a 2 year old foster child as well. When we got pregnant I wanted a book that talked about newborn/infant adjustments and how to handle the tiny babies. She likes the Berenstain Bears tv show so I thought this would be good. It does end on a good note, but during most of the book, sister is VERY negative and had way more issues than my daughter had even thought of! Maybe this would be better for a child a bit older or for a child who is already negative about a new baby."
1,shirts are pink,Upon opening my order the shirts had an off white look to them. Looking closer they had a slight pink look to them. I have washed with bleach twice and now they look light pink To lazzy to deal with hassel of returning so into the clean rag drawer they go
4,CK t shirts,"it's a little on the thin side but it would serve best as an undershirt, rather than as something that would stand alone!"
3,Just OK.,"The shipping was very fast and on time. The price was also very reasonable.. but the quality of the t-shirts was not what I expected. I had to spend at least few minutes cutting the seams of the shirts. Also when I handwashed them for the first time, the black color bleeded alot. It doesn't bleed the second time but it does bleed alot on the first time. Only the quality of cotton is good. It seems very durable and it is actually pretty thick."
4,depends what country it is made in,"I have used he EXACT same brand and size for several years, RECENTLY the tag showed made in Haiti, medium in Haiti there DOES NOT equal medium EGYPT. Amazon customer service was vey understanding arranged for a prompt exchange. It would have been better to know PRIOR to purchase what is the country the product was made in.Quality of construction in BOTH Haiti & Egypt very goodFabric is very thin and comfortable, which is EXACTLY why I buy this brand.5 Stars if the country / size did not require an exchange"
2,Too long,"The quality of these shirts are pretty good. They are soft and seem durable. The only problem I had was that they were way too long. I'm fairly short (5'7""), and the mediums were about 6 inches below my beltline."
2,Thinner than before,I have ordered a pack of these shirts before and they were exactly what I expected. This time however the material was just a bit thinner than before and the stitching was not quite as sturdy as before. Within the first couple wears of this product the stiching around the sleeve has already torn. The quality is just not the same as previous packs of this shirt that i have owned.
2,This product is too big,"I`M 200lb,select size L but is too big for me. Maybe I should select size S for me.Amazon`s size guide is not accuracy."
2,Not a good Value,At ~10 each these are not well made. The material is thin with long loose strings on most seams and size is too big. Dockers T-Shirts are a great deal at ~4 each--I only wish they came in black!Not sure if it matters but mine were made in Haiti.
5,Excellente,"Excelente quede complacido con el producto, proximamente espero poder seguir realizando compras de este estilo, gracias por todo, Feliz Año"
3,Ok,"Good fit, but material is too thin. Can be worn as an undershirt very well, but if you plan on wearing as a tee-shirt to work out in or around the house I would rather buy the ""lofteez"" (from fruit of the loom) since their cotton is thicker and more resistant."
3,Longer than expected,"These shirts are longer than any other size medium shirts I've ever bought (the sleeves stuck out of my short sleeve shirt sleeves and I do not wear super fitted shirts). Also, when they came, they were pink. I looked at them in a lot of different lights, had other people look at them, compared to other shades of white. It was weird. It went away after the first wash though and now they are a nice brilliant white."
3,As expected,Same undershirts as at the mall for less money. The brand I prefer. Not sure what more needs to be said.
5,Great fit and quality,Great fit and quality as promised in the description. Neckline fits nicely and length fits deeply into pants so that it doesn't come loose.
3,N'Awlins,"Hard to rate. I love the city so I love any reminders of the place. Interesting and a good length, but it doesn't really capture the spirit of this amazing city."
5,My first review,"This is the best thing out there on New Orleans. If you have any interest in New Orleans - why we cook like we do, dance like we do, play music like we do - this gives it to you. This is from the PBS series ""American Experience"" and PBS did it well. This is not a ""Katrina"" piece. Although Katrina factors in at the end, it is not the focus. Here the story starts with the folks that founded the City and moves through to Katrina. Along the way, it pulls no punches and includes the lowlights with the highlights. Even if you know New Orleans, there is plenty here that you will enjoy. I'm getting extras for gifts."
2,Just a Recording made for money,"I don't feel that the producer of this was very serious about his or their work, It is a half assed attempt to con us out of money..Save you money buy ammo.........."
1,How misleading a title can be,"'The Art of Elizabeth Blackadder': aha!,thinks an admirer of that fine artist,and orders away . What you get is a lazy , repetetive spin-off of a television program or a video cassette,apparently transcribed verbatim , no effort being made to pull the dialogue into readable and informative format,haphazardly illustrated. Very disappointing for someone who knows Blackadder's work , doing her a great disservice for those who do not."
1,a waste of paper,"With this book I was expecting something more along the lines of color psychology, but it turned out to be 176 pages of common sense. Molly Holzschlag takes the time to teach you the basics of Photoshop without mentioning Photoshop. Unless you know absolutely nothing about digital images, and I stress 'absolutely nothing', then this book would be a complete waste of time for you. Even if that were the case, you're better off with a book on Photoshop."
2,i feel sorry for the trees,"... that died for the paper of this book.The book is filled with lots of pages displaying nothing but colors. Without a comment. Just like that. Thank you Mrs. Holzschlag but i already have these colors on my computer, no need for you to sell them to me in a book. They'll look different on my screen anyway than on paper.What i want is color psychology, color associations, how to best combine different colors (beyond just naming the typical color schemes - color scheme generator 2 could automatically create that type of generic scheme) , things to consider on the screen other than ""use browser-safe colors"". These topics are hardly covered in this book. Maybe mentioned, but that's about it."
5,great figure.,love the figure. have been looking to add this to my collection for awhile since i am a big regal fan. love the packaging as well.
3,Ok but not great history of the SS.,"This book is a decent introduction into the study of the SS. It doesn't have much (if any) new information and it doesn't go very deep into the subject but if you are only starting to study WWII or the SS this is a good primer (probably best suited to high school students). It also mainly concentrates on the fighting units of the SS while devoting very little space to the Waffen SS's atrocities and participation in the Holocaust. I also would have liked to have more infomation about the foreign SS units. The book has several good photographs in it.Again, not for serious students of military history but a good start for study of the SS if you are interested in learning about WWII military units. Just don't expect too much."
4,A good book.,This is a good book and the first I've read by Christopher Ailsby. It covers almost everything concerning the war on the eastern front 1941 - 1945. I`m thinking of aquiring Roll Of Infamy by the same author.Christer
4,"Informative, detailed and chock full of information","Given some of the less-than-favourable reviews here I thought I was going to find an average, if not hum-drum book. I was very pleasantly surprised! This is a great book, very detailed with good descriptions of the Karvonon method of calculating HRR (Heart Rate Reserve) and its correlation to VO2 Max and Net VO2 and how to use this information to determine appropriate training zones. It had some good sections on various other fitness activities (such as cycling, swimming and walking) and serves as a good resource for anyone wanting to get fit faster while lowering your chances of injury or overtrainig.I think if you combined this book with ""Heart Rate Monitor Training for the Compleat Idiot"" you'd posses all the information you'd ever need to train to maximum effectiveness with your heart rate monitor."
2,The book had some good information,"I had bought the book to help me with Mtn. bike training and my son with running. The book didn't provide information for mtn. biking though it did have a section on road biking. The running chapter seemed incomplete. The major table that was supposed to explain the heart rate targets was not explained fully. Also, oddly, there is a quote in there that is identical in two chapters but attritubted to two different people!In summary, I was disappointed with the book but it may be helpful to someone else."
2,Feeble Heart Rate Training,"This book tries to do too much: it wants to be a heart rate training book AND a book about training for sporting events. The book is only 200 pages...get the picture? The book provides cursory information on training for various sports: walking, running, cycling, in-line skating, and triathlon. Obviously, if you really wanted to learn how to train competitively for these sports, this ISN'T the book for you. If you're looking for a book that tells you how to create a workout you can do at a health club on a stair-climbing machine or elliptical trainer, etc....this is NOT the book for you. Sure, there's a chapter on ""group"" exercise (i.e. aerobic class), but it FAR from practical. The introductory chapters merely delineate the heart zones rather than offering suggestions for combining them meaningfully or providing progressive programs. The book simply tries to cover too much in order to increase its market."
1,JUNK,"I have been interested in improving my performance for years, and finally decided to take the plunge and look into heart-rate monitoring. This book does not really support a specific philosophy and who knows if the so called ""science"" is supportable. I also read ""Heart Monitor Training for the Compleat Idiot"" by John L. Parker and recommend it. It appears much more scientific and emphasizes recovery over training in a zone. Don't buy this book. Rory Donaldson roryd@brainsarefun.com"
2,"Wandering, without meat","The first chapters could be used for POLAR promotional material. They are repetitive, sale-sy and without any real substance. The contributions by other authors are better, and they do offer some good introductory material for the person interested in fitness training, but little to help in setting up a program, goals, methods, etc. The final discussions about software presents a list of criteria for good software, but no contacts, no list of products or companies, no web page URLs. The reason this book is not a one star book, is because of the multiple authors and perspectives that round out and give a little credibility to the message."
5,This is a practical book with scientific sense.,The author does a service to those wanting to improve fitness quantitively. One doesn't have to compete with others to enjoy better results.
2,not for the average person,This book is geared more for the person into competive training. I did not find it at all uesful for a general fitness program.
2,A traumatolgist...Part II,"I think that George's point is that calling yourself a ""tramatologist"" doesn't mean a thing. I study trauma too...but that doesn't make my review of a heart-rate training book any more valid. My review was based on facts. The book isn't that great...for the reasons I gave. I can even be more specific about my reasons. Note: saying it is ""fun"" and ""informative"" means absolutely nothing...just like saying, ""I'm a tramatolgist."" (sic) And that would be...a MD? PhD? BA? A mail-order degree? Think about it... The book isn't terrible and I'd recommend going to the library to check it out if you're looking for a cursory introduction to heart-rate training...but I wouldn't buy it. By the way, Sally's book isn't that good either."
2,Why is this a great book?,"It is interesting to note that the ""reader"" from Telluride, Colorado does not list any reasons ""why"" this is a great book. In fact, no one does! Why? The book is not that good! Ed makes learning fun? Please... An article in a fitness magazine provides as much ""fun"" information! Also, just because someone claims to be traumatologist (whatever that means!) and endorses the book, it doesn't make it any more legitimate. If it's so ""great"" why doesn't anyone give any reasons why? Hmm...I'm not against Burke & I'm not against Polar...I am for honest, fair reviews based ON fact. An honest review? This book is simply okay."
1,Don't waste your money,This solution is only filtered water and a tiny bit of isopropanol alcohol. I expect the alcohol is only there so they can say they sell a solution and not just water for almost $3.00 per ounce.I am an optician and was an optical lab technician for several years. To edge polycarbonate (the same material disks are made of) straight water is used. Distilled would be best and is way cheaper than buying this solution.
2,Pretty Expensive Cleaner,I bought this product as I did NOT know what else to use and think it's VERY expensive for what it is.If you investigate this product you find out it's only a distilled type of water with a tiny amount of alcohol(less than 1%).The bottle is probably the most expensive part.
5,Feeling Experimental? Yoko Ono's hits remixed.,"This makes a fine companion to Between My Head and the Sky. Current young artists add their electronic hip hop danceable takes to some of her best songs. The first six cuts flow smoothly. Everyman has a woman that loves him...a-la Os!Mutantes aah-hah-huh! Favorite cut:Death of Samantha,""people say I'm cruel...Yeah! I'm a cruel chick, baby....something inside of me died that day... Yeah, I'm cruel,I'm a..."" Also recommended:Yoko and the Pet Shop Boys (different from this cd's version of) Walking On Thin Ice from Disco 4. ""I knew a girl once who tried to walk across a lake of ice. They say this lake was as deep as the ocean...(pause)Do you think she knew about it?"" Obtain this and you will see. Where can I get a pair of those killer shades?"
3,Uuummmm...,"I'm not a fan of Yoko Ono, because sometimes her voice is kind of annoying. Like on the song O Sisters. Sometimes, I wonder why people like her so much. Her music is cool, but her voice is crazy sometimes."
1,"""Forgotten But Not Gone""","I won't risk incurring the wrath of all you good liberals out there, but -honestly - it IS a truism that ""you can tell an album by its cover"" - or in THIS case, its NAME will more than adequitely suffice. And, yes, I have a...""friend"" who is into musical...""ephemera"" (ie, the ""Rat Pack,"" early Eno, the (SUPER-BLGH) ""B-52s,"" et cetera), so, in the interest of ""NON-Cameron Crowe/GOOD rock and roll journalism,"" he and I...""prepared ourselves"" for inital listening to ""Witch."" And it didn't take long. Fewer than 2 tracks in, I literally screamed for him to ""TAKE THE FREAKING THING OFF before 'nuclear meltdown' actually becomes reality!"" He understood: he played guitar for a band I was in 30 or so years ago (btw, the ONLY band where I've been ""the keyboard player"") and, even then, he & I clashed regularly about such ""acts"" like ""Television"" or ""Iggy Pop."" ""Witch"" ain't for the faint of heart, or, for THAT matter, anyone who doesn't regularly ""fly too close to the sun."""
5,"""That was beautiful!""","This album is great! Yoko comes through with an incredible sort of retrospective done right. Working with so many artists, it's really fun to hear how they've gone about arranging and producng these songs. I'm normally horrified by these compilation albums where an aging artist teams up with the youngins, but Yoko Ono has such a vitality to her, and she so definitely allows these artists to be themselves along with her that the resulting album is refreshing.Also, another reviewer (from my own hometown of Des Moines, funnily enough) ignorantly said Yoko didn't allow anyone else to sing. Not true. Cat Power sings with her, as do the Polyphonic Spree. And I may have missed a few more--I dunno. I just know this album lifts my spirits in surprising ways!"
4,Yoko filtered through a variety of artists,"The various artists working with Yoko on this album have taken their favorite bits from her previous work and created a very enjoyable recording that withstands repeat listenings. The harsh edges have been toned down, and a variety of song atmospheres combine to produce the most commercial work of Yoko's catalog.Yoko haters will never give her an honest listen, but John saw great value in her musical work. Perhaps her collaborators here bring forth some isolated elements of what John appreciated."
2,Fair but lacking,"I was excited to read this volume in preparation for a more research oriented reference work on underground passages in the UK and continental Europe, however the strength in this work is the anecdotal information and less in the hard mechanics of the available material. This book was a second choice in two volumes ordered (the other of which is out of print and no longer commonly available). In hindsight, I would have foregone this book in favor of amterial commonly available on the Internet as public domain, fan-based sites and government information. In all, the information of use amounted to less than 500 words. As a book of entertainment and light reading, it is just about average."
5,The Great Music of Henry Mancini,"Great performance of Monica Mancini. Henry Mancini was the best composer of this century. I have more or less 80 CDs of the the great ""HANK"". Congratulations Monica, you are wonderful. Sorry my english. I want to know you."
2,Disappointed,I purchased them because I thought they were pink. Yes I was looking for pink tie downs. When I received them they were red. I am sure they probably would work just fine. But I wanted pink ones.
1,Warranty is a fraud! Don't buy any Quantum products.,"I purchased this product from Amazon in August of 2008 for use in Southern California. After a week of use it started making loud clicking and popping noises from the wheel mechanism. It is now January 2009 and I am still trying to get it fixed by Quantum. They ignore your phone calls, they don't return calls, they tell you what you want to here and do absolutely nothing. This is a very sincere warning... Do Not Buy Any Products From Quantum Fitness... you will regret it!"
2,"Nice idea, but badly written","As a profesional investment writer and editor myself, maybe I am fussy, but I couldn't believe how badly put together this book was.Nice idea for a book though: in the words of John Templeton, ""There's always a bull market SOMEWHERE.""The authors' thesis in Bull Hunter is that, for the next decade or so at least, that bull market won't be in US stocks.Maybe so. And, some good alternatives are offered for consideration.However, I found the book badly written and repetitve. It could have benefitted tremendously from being properly edited. Then I might not have become dizzy from going round in circles as I read.All in all, a disappointment."
1,A disappointment,"The book uses almost two hundred pages to state that you should invest using ETF's, that China will grow for many years, that dollar is going down due debt, that oys should use call options when prices rise and put options when they decline. Constant repetition of these same simple ideas throughout the book. I do not know who this book is for, serious investors will learn nothing new and beginning investors certainly should not invest via options."
1,Nothing But Bull,"This book promises a lot and delivers little. Most of it consists of truisms. Promising readers an adventure, it's a big snooze."
1,Quick Summary,"Because the US stock market is going nowhere, one must look at other countries via EFT's and US companies that profit from the needs of other countries such as China. Book mentions: BRG,KEPLF,EEM,BG,EWY,RIO,CAT,DE,DD and KMT. Does not inform how to select these investments before they rise in value."
2,dollar index versus bond yields,"On page 46 of the book: A Bull Hunter, Dan denning wrote""The less investors like the dollar, the more they're going todemand higher interest payments from the US government""in simple terms:dollar index UP, bond price UP and bond yield downdollar index DOWN, bond price DOWN and bond yield UPfor the first period of May, 2004 of Fig 2-1, US Dollar Indexmade higher high than the entire year of 2004. In other word, thetrend of the Dollar Index in the first five months of the 2004 was uptrend. Whereas, in Fig 2-2, page 50, the bond prices werefalling in the period April-June, i.e. higher interests.further, for the rest of the 2004, TLT price was in uptrend, in otherword the interest must be DOWN. If the statement is true thenthe dollar index should be UP. But the Dollar index figure 2-1showing a down trend.The choice of these two graphs proves the statement is wrong and the BED index is totally NOT Usefull at all"
2,Dissapointed,Still haven't received bullitins that were supposed to come with the purchase of the book
4,loved it,"I thought the convolutions over the fella buying the basketball jerseys and how he went about paying for those jerseys was amazingly similar to personal experience. the movie properly addressed individual patterns on returning home and the general ""what's going on"" thoughts many have upon returning home after living in the city for a time. the movie was great for that."
3,deep,"this wonderful made movie, show me the talents of these actors. the story line was slow but was real life adventure of the rez. this is a movie to add to your collection of native films."
4,Who says Smoke Signals is the first...,"Medicine River may have lost some of it's subtley on screen but it's worth a viewing. Thomas King's tale of a returning Native whose travels have taken him around the world, leads us all back to the place of our origin, equally foreign and familiar. With the release of Sherman Alexie's film, Smoke Signals, I hope to see a renewed interest in this film. I did find Graham Green a bit stiff in his scenes with his manager but thoroughly enjoyed the basketball rivalry in which Tom King plays the opposing player. I am also fond of the theme music which helps pull together the feeling of the film. END"
2,"Good movie, poor tape","I had to return the tape because of poor tape quality. The movie is pretty good, but the tape quality is very bad."
5,warm loving story told so a 10yo boy would watch and could,"I HAD NEVER IMAGINED G GREEN AS A LOVE INTEREST IN A MOVIE. BRAVO. HE DID GREAT. THE CAST OF CHARACTORS, THE SETTING AND THE STORY LINE KEPT YOU GOING. IT REQUIRES AT LEAST KEEPING THE KLEENEX CLOSE BY.THE TEACHING OF TRIBAL CUSTOMS WITH THE MODERN DAY PLUS THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CHARACTORS WAS GREAT...THERE WAS HUMOR, WIT AND INTELLIGENCE USED IN THIS FILM. BUT THAT IS WHAT I HAVE COME TO EXPECT FROM ANY FILM THAT MR GREENE IS INVOLVED WITH.THE CAST OF CHARACTORS INCLUDE PEOPLE WHO HAVE APPEARED WITH MR GREEN IN OTHER FILM. THE DIRECTOR IS ALSO WELL KNOWN FROM TV.MY GIRLFRIEND'S 10 YEAR OLD SON PROBABLY SIGNED IT UP BEST, ""ITS OKAY FOR A GIRL MOVIE, CAN WE WATCH IT AGAIN?""SAYS MY FEELINGS EXACTLY"
4,lovin the ease,"This is a great tablet, especially for beginners. Set up was simple and I love how you can set up the buttons to launch the program of your choice. The pen takes some getting used to though. Allow yourself time to master it. Overall, I think it is a great product."
1,Don't Bother,"This Wacom tablet was a total waste of money. I even tried giving it away to my niece who was a graphic artist student in college, and she didn't want it either. I purchased it to use with my cartography & GIS software for a mapping project I'm working on in our local national forest. This tablet was so inaccurate that I spent more time going back and erasing things than I cared to, and I'm talking hundreds of hours here totally wasted because this tablet could not accurately choose pixels. I've gone back to using a puck which is not as convenient, but cartography is all about accuracy."
5,great product,"I brought this on feb 11, and i've loved it since it took me about three hours of getting use to it, trust me it makes your artwork very easy...i have no problems with it."
3,"Noise problems, difficulties with Photoshop interface","This seems like a nice device and gets lots of advocacy from Photoshop experts. However I had lots of trouble.One problem is that the cursor jitters around a lot even though the pen or mouse is perfectly still. After a lot of work I discovered that if I connected a sheet of aluminum foil to my computer's case and put my bare foot on the foil, the jittering reduced by about 80%. BTW, I verified, by two different means, that the outlet's ground contact really is grounded. So that's not it.) So it looks like there is trouble with electrostatic pickup.The second problem is that I could find no way to make the pen pressure modulate the flow of Photoshop's airbrush. (I'm running Windows XP. Perhaps all those people who rave about this product use Macs.)"
5,Brave music!,"This cd is another thought-provoking gem from the prolific and brilliant topical singer-songwriter, David Rovics. Besides being an amazing lyricist, he has a wonderful lilting voice and can really play a guitar. Some of his songs are funny (though serious), while others are simply heart-breaking. Check out his website at davidrovics.com, or better yet see him live! (He tours constantly)."
3,Sacred Stones trilogy,"This book is one of those comprising ""The Sacred Stones"" trilogy. The other books are: ""The Temple of the Sun"" and ""The Tall Stones."" The other two books are very entertaining. I'd say the trilogy is mythological fantasy fiction. Its worth reading the entire trilogy, though I think ""Shadows on the Stones"" was markedly less enjoyable than the other two."
4,Hit and Miss,"I read through this book in one sitting, and found it to be great. I love the show, and like everyone else, I also love Ty. His new show, Extreme Makeover: Home Edition is also a great show. I was hoping the book had some actual plans for things, or more actual HOW TO's. But, it was filled with Ty humor, Ty pictures, and some good tips on renovating and repair. Maybe I was just hoping to see some tips and tricks on how to actual build some of the neat stuff he builds.I think we need to get Ty to write a book titled: Ty's Guide to Building Cool Things Easily for the Beginner. And, if he could do it all in the shower like that one picture, it would sell like hot cakes :D :D :DAnyway, thumbs up to Ty for being a great person and for writing a good book. I only gave it 4 stars and not 5 because it didn't have more information in it, as far as building things which is what he primarily does on Trading Spaces."
5,This book is good,"I never knew who Ty was until he came onto Extreme Makeover Home Edition. Ty is one of my favorite desinger on the show, so when I found out that he had a book out I had to buy it to support him. The pictures are awesome and some of Ty's comment and ideas are good. One of the things I like are the tylights that he created. One of thoes days I am going to have some of my own.Great job Ty. Keep up the good work and we look forward to some more.If you are a huge Ty fan I will go head and buy it."
2,A little disappointing,"I love Trading Spaces, so I was thrilled to find another Trading Spaces book on the market. I'm glad I bought this, but I'd give it a C- compared to the others. I was hoping that even more of Ty's funny personality would shine through in the book, but it didn't. The book doesn't quite make it as a good how-to manual because it isn't detailed enough. The book doesn't quite satisfy me as a Trading Spaces fan because there isn't much evidence of the show in Ty's book. The book is kind of odd in its approach. I love Ty but I was disappointed in this book."
1,Save your money and DON'T BUY this!,If I could I wouldn't even give this 1 star. Now I know why he was fired from Trading Spaces. Granted the premise is interesting but most of the projects are done on the cheap and will not last the normal wear and tear of most families. To do a project correctly and to do it well is the hallmark of most do-it-yourself manuals but not this book. One would be better off with a true how-to-do-it manual by Norm Abrams of This Old House or the Readers Digest manuals of the same. Only if you desire your projects to be inspired from this former model turned designer layman would you buy this book. A waste of good paper.
5,TYriffic book!!!!!!!!,"Leave it to Ty Pennington to write a book that manages to actually teach you how do do things around your home, but laugh while you are doing it.....Fun graphics......love the colors throughout the book.....Pics of Ty are great....overall.....really great feel-good book."
1,Very mediocre,"If you're a fan of Trading Spaces, you'll buy this book, and that's fine. But if you are expecting any really good information on home repair as per the title, you will be very disappointed, as I was. There's not much in this book except some pictures of a guy who obviously thinks he's good looking. It doesn't seem as if he knows much about home repair or he would have put more information into this book. I actually like Ty, but I would have been happier with a Ty pinup calendar or something instead of a book that promises something it just doesn't deliver."
2,Not what I had hoped for,The construction of this brush makes it virtually impossible to keep it along the wall as you try to brush. I am not sure if it is the shape or the weight but it just will not stay next to the wall after the first couple of feet with out tremendous effort.
2,The Movie/Broadway Cover Collection. NOT so Ultimate.,"This box set should called ""The Movie/Broadway Cover Collection"" and NOT ""The Ultimate Collection"". With the exception of ""Ballade Pour Adeline"", every song in this collection appears to be cover of some movie theme or broadway music. Any Richard Cladyerman ""Ultimate Collection"" should contain mostly ""original"" songs composed by Paul de Senneville and Olivier Toussaint. I am talking about songs like Lyphard Melodie, Voyage A Venise, Nostalgy, Les Reves Du Matin, Lettre A Ma Mere and finally Marriage D'Amour. Go search YouTube and listen to these songs and you will know what I am talking about."
2,not worth collection at all,The tracks on three CD are very generic and not the best of Richard Claydeman. The second CD all are based on andrew lloyd webber and third one is mixed classic and movie songs. Richard clayderman's the anniversary collection probably is the best one with his best pieces.
5,Fantastic music,This set of three CD's has wonderful music for easy listening or anytime you want to hear a terrific piano player.
3,FIX THIS LISTING,"I hope someone reads this, please fix this listing, you've got two different books called Requiem interwoven with each other, this book is not written by Joyce!"
1,Don't try it.,"I have been a Heinlein fan since my teenage years. He is my favorite Science fiction writer. But, even the best has his off days and there is a reason why these stories were unpublished when he was alive, they are not very good. This book was very disappointing."
4,Good,"This CD is a nice style of black metal guitars with screaming and clean vocals. A bit slow, and repedative inside each song. Not a lot of riffs. Their newer CD ""Tyburn"" are awesome songs, some of their best overall."
2,Concerto 23 Adagio ruined,"I bought this CD specifically for the Concerto 23 Adagio. At the most critical expressive moments, which the pianist was carrying off very well, a member of the audience went into a coughing fit! It fully ruined the mood of an otherwise flawlessly dreamy adagio. I realize this is the risk you take when you purchase a live performance CD, but the timing of this outburst reflected a lack of heightened awareness at best and at worst bordered on sabotage. This CD will go to Goodwill and I'll buy another CD that's been recorded in a studio. Concertos 14 and 25 were performed well."
4,Beyond What I Can See,"I thoroughly enjoy listening to this album. It has a variety of songs, from Christian to playful, children's 'fantasy'; to a creative rendition of Amazing Grace; a Playful ""Latte Blues""; and a 'response' to Sept. 11. I find myself playing the CD over and over. It is especially great during rushhour gridlock. I find my mood elevated immediately! Sharon has a unique, clear, strong voice - typically ""Coffee-House style"". Her enunciation is impecable! Truly an enjoyable CD."
4,Always at ease,"I you ever get the opportunity to read this book; take it to heart. My reasons are basically due to the fact of overcoming the limits of the social life as well as the private lives that we have. It's an uplifting and encouraging book if you live the examples that it offers. Trust me, it's a 5-star book. ""K"""
5,Very thorough,Very well done once again. I like the ability to mix and match programs especially.G.L.
2,DVD Is Better,"This book has a lot of different stretches in it but nothing tageted towards specific movements. I need to improve my Side Kick height but I can't really gather from the book what I should focus on. I also bought the DVD which has some workouts and is a better deal.If you really want to work on your splits you should buy ""Stretching Scientifically"". That book is awesome and I must say very painful but the results are fantastic. It also explains exactly how all the muscles interact and how some of the strecthes in ""Ultimate Flexability"" are actually doing you more harm than good.Bill 2nd Dan Black Belt TKD"
5,Great for beginners,"Great book: easy to read and understand. I have never practiced martial arts and I bought the book only to improve my body health. However it is great and it will sure help me a lot, so I can play a lot better come sports like basketball, soccer, etc."
5,Outstanding Resource,This is an outstanding piece on stretching for various martial arts purposes or for flexibility in general. It provides an in-depth description of many different exercises and then recommends several combinations of 15 or so for achieving different goals. Perfect for your own use or to plan a class session.
5,Well done and thorough,"As someone new to martial arts but not to stretching, this book is a great resource. Years of dance training taught me the importance of stretching but there was a lot I'd forgotten and some I'd never learned in the first place. It's so helpful to have the author explain, in plain english, how stretching works and why some exercises are successful while others are a waste of time. I also found the harder and easier variations for each exercise a big help in modifying some of the exercises to suit what I need as I work on my flexibility at home between classes. Highly recommended for anyone looking to become more flexible or just stay in shape."
5,My teacher snagged it.......................,"I got about 45 minutes to look it over, took it to class with me. My teacher snagged it, haven't seen it since! I think I'm being tortured with stuff out of the book because it's all new......LOLGreat book, lots of pictures with good explanations of what is being accomplished with each exercise."
4,Could be better,"I have 5 books on stretching, and this one takes second place. It has an abundance of exercises and programs but I feel as though I will only ever use a handful of these exercises. It seems like Dr.Kim has foused on quantity over quality in this book."
5,Very comprehensive,"I was looking for a book to learn the proper way to stretch for Taekwondo and extend the range of my kicks.This book covers all areas well, it is extremely comprehensive. Almost too much information to process here. This is the only stretching book I have read but I am very impressed with it. Ki-Yup!!I also recommend ""Taekwondo: The state of the Art"" book that contains all the forms and kicks and so forth. That book is awesome so you can practice at home in between classes or if your TKD teacher has a thick accent like mine."
1,Does not offer much help,"I have always had problems with flexibility and thought this book would be a great way to help me improve. I was initially excited how it had sport specific stretching, but then realized the instructions were poor, the plans were not well thought out, and there was no real process or strategy involved. There are too many things left up to the reader to decide (you pick which stretches to use), and if the plan is followed (core program plus sport specific) it seems like it would take 45-60 minutes to stretch. Not what I was looking for. I was hoping for a specific plan with days and times and exercises and gradual progression, but this book does not offer this program. Keep looking if that is your goal. If you want countless stretching exercises, this book may be helpful."
4,Good Depiction of What It Takes,"This documentary is a great overview not only of 'Hamlet', but the dedication and commitment it takes to 'put on a show'. This production, performed in Birmingham, England and directed by Derek Jacobi, showcases a young Kenneth Branagh in his first professional attempt at the role. From the first rehearsals, to fight scenes, to interviews with all involved, to the director's notes (a good scene where Branagh is picked on a little by Jacobi), to the eventual performance, this is an excellent primer for what it takes to do this complex play live. Worth watching."
5,"""The play's the thing!""","I watched this presentation because I watched most of the previous Hamlet presentations and was intrigued to find what I could possibly have missed or should have been looking for. I was not disappointed.This is copyrighted 1990 and depicts a young Kenneth Branagh preparing to play Hamlet on the stage in 1988. I actually saw his 242 minute film where he played Hamlet in 1996. He is being directed by Derek Jacobi who needs no introduction.I'm not sure that this presentation has a focus; as it is Hamlet in part it also focuses on the actors and the acting in part, and would not focusing on the character of Hamlet actually shows all the elements that goes into a stage production. So we truly see that the play's the thing.I purposely did not go into more detail as I think you will appreciate the presentation better than anything that I can describe. I did find the skills and logistics of making the play quite intriguing."
5,Up to Zion,Great seller and awsome CD and arrived on time in great shape. Would do business with this seller again.
3,Slacking second side,"3 1/2Be it hard to appreciate an entire EST disc as much as the few wholly thrilling tracks that always accompany them, few contemporary jazz trios plunged as easily and often into adventurous mode without loosing an accessible grace."
2,Overrated by Amazon reviewers,"I bought this DVD based soley on the positive reviews I read here at Amazon.com. I'm always looking for good family entertainment and this sounded like a winner, but we were sadly disappointed with this movie. The acting was poor (except for the main character who is a veteran of film and TV) and the script way below average. All of my family walked out on this one; I stayed with it till the end and lo and behold the last 5 minutes were the best part of the movie. Finally the dialogue and people stopped being too cute and too forced and became ""real"". I've seen much better Billy Graham films than this one."
2,It was an OK movie,"The movie was slow. The worst part was the way the girl was dressed. Very tight clothing throughout the movie. What were the makers of the movie thinking knowing it would be a ""family"" movie. I was embarrassed watching it with my family. I threw it away afterwards."
3,Poor Sound Quality,"Received my order in a timely fashion, but the sound quality is poor. Don't know what happened, but I have to turn the volune up high for the 1st 20 minutes to hear this flick. I don't think I've ever received a DVD with such poor sound quality. The movie itself is excellent and I would recommend it to others. But I hope they get one with better sound."
1,I wish I'd gotten something else,"If I lived in the US I'd have returned this book. The games aren't that great. Furthermore, they don't cover the grammar and conversation I teach in junior high school in Japan. The illustrations are terrible - I don't claim to draw and I could do better than this. To use any of these games (they're actually more puzzles than games) I'd cover up the ugly drawings with liquid paper."
1,television drivel,"this is, unfortunately, the sort of tripe that gets published these days. this sharpe kid is inaptly named. he may have too much time on his hands, watching jerry springer, and reconstituting the most schlocking effects into tortured naturalistic prose. don't waste your time."
1,Well-written But Offensive,"I actually agree with many of the reviewers that this is a well-written book and a quick read. I kept reading it because I found it interesting. However, the ""happy"" ending, in particular, seems to me to suggest that childhood sexual abuse is OK. (Don't continue reading this review if you don't want to know how the book ends.) It's bad enough for a twelve year old to have an affair with her teacher, but Mary/Paul spends years with her, leaves her, and then goes back, and will apparently now live happily ever after. I found this offensive. I don't understand why people would say this book is hilarious."
3,An Engaging Look at a National Problem,"Fat is a documentary that looks at America's weight problem. The movie is not encouraging, though it does hold your interest.The filmmakers focus on the reasons it so difficult to lose weight. We evolved in a world of scarcity and our ability to gain weight (and then keep our weight up) helped us when food was not available. The scarcity is gone (at least in the developed world). As a result, we find its easy to gain weight and difficult to lose it.The people who appear in the film are likeable, and one sympathizes with their earnest attempts to ""do the right thing."" But the viewer sees little reason to hope that their lives will improve. The filmmakers imply that it is just too difficult to control weight in our calorie-rich, sedentary world. (Fat does present gastric bypass surgery as an effective way to lose weight).Fat is not a bad film, but another documentary on the same issue - Killer at Large - does a better job of engaging its viewers."
4,E.Q. beats I.Q.,"Dr. Goleman summarizes research linking ""Emotional Intelligence"", E.Q., to success in relationships, work, etc. His presentation is engaging and humorous. He reduces E.Q. to five dimensions: Self-awareness, Managing Emotions, Motivation, Empathy, and Social Skills. For each dimension he explains its significance and provides useful examples. The presentation ends with useful tips for applying the material in real life situations. I found the research thought-provoking and practical."
5,Psych video,"I find this video in line with other informational psychology videos. It provides a broad overview of EQ. Some of the information is TMI for most audiences--the video is 45 minutes long. For the price, it's a good introduction to emotional intelligence.I also use the BRAINS! video which, though it's far more expensive, has a faster pace and more engaging content (Hollywood movie clips and such). BRAINS! also comes with hours of activities to lead a group, so I imagine that's part of why it's so pricey."
3,At Passage Outtakes...almost.,"Quod begins by shifting his weight to the center of the concealed disc. No autobiography is complete without sleight-of-hand.Quod defines the ""vision"" as a carpet thrown out from under,--dislodging the phantasm, the second-sight--. No vision is complete without the tug of failure, without an aggravating sense of the ironic. Quod may be misled by education.Quod I've seen several times in the area, haunted yet perservering in the philosophical soup he's ladled onto a lyricism--stirred, tasted, and evacuated.Quod still confounds me...and for that I am grateful."
5,Great book to help kids understand what a family member might experience as they fight cancer.,"I bought a copy for my friends children. She has breast cancer and I thought it would be a great resource. I also bought a copy for my children so they would understand what their friends mom is going through, we just interchange the names for those of their young friends and then we also have used it to explain what their grandpa went through as he is fighting cancer. A really great resource for anyone with young children who could use some help to understand what a loved one or friend may be going through. Sometimes we read the page verbatim, other times we interject things we have noticed as we have been around loved ones during a particular stage of their fight. Great resource!"
3,A bit tight,"This must be a later version of the bowl. It won't quite turn all the way into the slot. But, the bowl stays on."
5,replacement piece for Cuisinart BFP-703CH,This was a replacement piece for my Cuisinart BFP-703CH. It was the exact duplicate for the one that got broken when it fell on the tile floor. Amazon's price was the best!
5,Good product,"The bowl arrived earlier than expected and was exactly what I needed. I do wish they made this in glass, but since they don't, this will have to do."
4,Royal Air Farce season,These DVD's are Classic Air Farce. It was great to view them again. They arrived in new condition. They are valuable addition to our collection.
2,Does not stay tight to wrist,"The tightening mechanism to keep the strap tight to your wrist does not work well. It does not stay tight to your wrist. The point of having a tightening mechanism is because you're going to be moving, the slightest movement loosens it up and defeats the purpose."
3,Big and Bright,"I just bought this clock yesturday. The display is very bright in a dark room at night. I ended up putting a t-shirt over the display as it was lighting up the room too much, so then I couldn't see what the time was!. Also you can only see the time if you are looking level at it. I have the clock higher than the bed and cannot read the time from the lower level as the display fades out. However the speakers sound good and the nature sounds are very nice."
2,My Bad,"I can't act surprised about the fact that the clock is just a little too big and bright (read other reviews), but my biggest problem was the fact that the snooze button doesn't work. If all the features work, I'm sure this would be great, but can't do much with an alarm clock with no snooze. They were really nice though and have ordered me another which I will exchange. I'm hoping it works."
1,Do not buy this!,"The CD player stopped working ... it shows ""no"" on the display. Called Timex Audio, and they replaced it. But the replacement did the same thing after a couple of months. Called the company, no further warranty on it nor repair available. A waste of money."
1,Don't waste your money,"I loved it when I bought it, but the CD player stopped working within the first year. From the other reviews, I see I'm not the only one who had this problem. I paid $60 for it from Bed Bath and Beyond, thinking the quality would match the price. Not so. Don't waste your money."
1,cd quit working,"liked the design, kid loved it and used display as a night light. cd player stopped working in 7 months with light use. returned under extended warranty and looking for replacement"
1,Probably would be great...if it only worked,"We purchased this clock and thought ""it has it all! and for a great price, too!"" Except....that the CD player worked only 1 time. After that, it only ever spun half-heartedly, declaring via readout that there was no disc inserted. As a CD player, it is absolutely worthless. Furthermore, the ""nature"" sounds are so strident (does anyone find frogs croaking loudly to be relaxing?), they are far more irritating than relaxing. Lastly, the gold colored readout, while classy looking by day (more attractive than most), is almost unreadable at night against the faint gold lighted background. I can honestly say it was the worst purchase I ever made for $50 and deeply regretted that the receit was misplaced so it could not be returned. I highly recommend to STAY AWAY from this piece of under-engineered pile of plastic and wires."
1,Do Not Buy This!,"I bought 2 of these when my baby was born, primarily for the nature sounds, which are great. However, BOTH broke within 6 months. The first started making CDs skip after 2 months, I actually went to the trouble and expense of sending it in for repair (I think they sent me a new one back). Then the other one went on the fritz--it just stops playing CDs in the middle, and sometimes starts skipping. Now the replacement one they sent is starting to skip when I play the nature sounds. What a piece of junk! SAVE YOUR MONEY!! DO NOT BUY!! (Oh, and yes, the clock face is way too bright--it lights up the whole room at night. I had to cover up the one in the baby's room.)"
1,Does not fit the popular leafield valve.,I just purchased my 2nd aire kayak. I have leafield valves on them. I thought that valve was one of the best and most popular valves on the market. This pump does not have an adapter that will fit them. I will try to contact Advanced Elements.
4,It works!,"This product works if for yeast problems, my problems were not cured over night but I feel much better after 3 months of using this and five lac. I am ordering five lac again and plan on taking the product as long as I need to. My joint pain and skin problems and mind fog have left completly."
3,TreeLac Candida Defense,I'm not sure what this was supposed to do... my daughter said that it really made her feel better. It did nothing as far as I could tell. I am saving some in case I get an infection. This is supposed to build immune support.
1,Made me sick,"This product comes individually wrapped in aluminum foil - which is unhealthy enough. Every time I took it for more than 2-3 days, I felt awful. No diarrhea or anything, but awful!I found out that I was getting a fever at least one of these times, but I thought it was just the flu. I stopped taking it *again* and the next time I tried it I got appendicitis and had to go through emergency surgery.I really believe this product caused the appendicitis - its not a balanced mixture of bacteria. It could make you really sick. I switched to Phillips colon health - and it works wonderfully for me (for much cheaper)."
2,crochet,Paterns are beautiful but could not use it because it is not well done. would not recommend this items for begginers like me.
4,Make One for Baby...,"Check customer images to see a photo of the 8 patterns in this book.Pinwheels is my favorite afghan in this book. Fifty-two motifs are crocheted then joined together for this design.The patterns in this book utilize a picot, Cluster stitch, Front Post Treble, Crisscross & Reverse half Double crochet stitch so this book might not be for beginning crocheters. However, these techniques are explained & illustrated in the book."
5,Great!,"Brand new condition. It is a booklet not a book. Either way, it is fine. I really wanted a pattern that was in it. Already working a blanket for a friend!"
5,Make One For Baby Crochet booklet,I was very pleased with the variety of different stitches for the afghans featured in this booklet. The designs are great!
1,"Zenith ZDS-5041 ""PRO"" Compression Tool","As an electrical engineer with very strong mechanical skills, I was EXTREEMLY disappointed with this tool. After only two connections, the tool broke. This meant a trip back to Lowe's to purchase another one. Guess what, this one broke after only one connection. The undersized nut's soft threads stripped. This made the entire installation worthless, because standard RG6 connectors will not fit the Quad shield Zenith cable. Also, the instruction sheet that came with the tool was a very poor quality photocopy, making the illistrations worthless. Lastly, the tool's cable stripper did not work very well either. I plan to pull out the Zenith cable and return it along with the connectors (which were too expensive by the way), and both tools and return it all to Lowe's, with a recommendaton that Lowe's remove these items from their shelf. I wasted a whole day using this garbage."
2,Disappointed Silver Palate Fan,"I have to disagree with other reviews of this cookbook. After trying 10+ recipes, I'm disappointed. The recipes I've tried have lacked flavor and originality.I'm a huge fan of The New Basics and the Silver Palate Cookbooks, but Sheila Lukins solo effort just does not compare."
2,BEWARE THE RECIPE FOR ORANGE FLAN,"In the original hardback edition, it's dead wrong and even tempering the eggs little by little with her recommendation of combining the scalding milk with the eggs will curdle them. Flavorful, but totally unacceptable texture if made with the directions in the recipe."
1,Untested recipes sink this book,I finally tossed this book out after making several disastrous recipes from it. They were obviously untested or poorly tested. I got tired of screwing things up from following her recipes.
2,Less than I'd hoped for,"I frequently refer to my Silver Palate cookbooks for interesting & tasty recipes & was very excited about purchasing this compendium of world cuisines, but thus far I am extremely disappointed- something I didn't expect. It is full of, instead of informative(if sometimes embarassingly whimsical)tidbits like those in the Silver Palate books, truly insipid, fluffy commentary and ""postcards"" of her travels to various countries. Most importantly, the recipes are absolutely uninspiring, while being perverted from their original forms, which leaves the hopeful cook with no real insight to international cooking, and with no redemptive alternative, either. Fusion cooking at its worst, basically. Sorry, didn't want it to be true, but it is."
5,Global America,"I would rate this cookbook 4 1/2 stars if Amazon gave me the option, but I'm a glass half-full type of gal. I'm 20 year-old college student on a tight budget. There's lots of excellent recipes in here which can be made very cheaply, and I have yet to make one that isn't delicious. The Chilean Quinoa Tabouleh is hands-down the best tabouleh I've EVER had, and I can make a large, large portion of it for around $6-$7. I never conceptualized the cookbook as being ""authentic,"" rather I viewed it from the start as a cookbook written by an American woman drawing global inspiration. That's exactly what it is, and it's delicious."
2,Watered down originals,"Being a great fan of the Silver Palate cookbooks, I lunged for the lone copy at my local bookstore. It is truly a might volume of international culinary delights and chock full of information.However, as I am Asian and have traveled to several of the countries written about in the book, I find most of the recipes watered down versions of the originals. These recipes are also lengthy and call for ingredients that you'd have to make a special trip to the market or deli for.No offense meant to anyone, but I find that the recipes here have also been tailored for American tastes. I've always thought that the point in trying out new cuisines was to appreciate and understand the uniqueness of them, and not try to make localized copycat versions."
4,"Interesting Twist on ""Sim City""","Well, this game is, pretty much, ""Sim City."" If you liked Sim City 4, you'd like this game, too.The twist, though, is that six types of social groups inhabit the city, and these groups may or may not get along. You end up needing all six types to develop your sity to its full potential, so you have to figure out, via city design or other strategies, how to assure that they don't fight with one another.It's a fun game, and has more than the usual subtleties to it. The version I got had a few language glitches, but runs pretty well. I recommend it for those starved for good sim games lately...like me."
4,"Very good simulation, great graphics","I did not guess this can be such a good simulation. Simulation rules make sense. Graphics is great and details are done very good.The only critics is about the performance. I had a Athlon 4800 + 2GRAM but only an on-board 256M NVidia graphics and this was a little slow. Also startup of the software took 2m (I have a SATA 256M Hard).In general if you have a good PC and a good graphics card this should be fun.I tried simcity socities before this and it was a terrible unstable software while this one , at least on my PC was stable. By the way it needs NTFS partitions and it will not install on FAT32."
4,Sim City - The Way It's Going to Be.,"This game resembles Sim City 4 in many ways, however it's far more advanced than the already ancient mechanics of Sim City 4... It fills the gap between now and then, and it allows you to really feel ut the cities you build and explore the vast scenery therein.Check out the features of the NEW SIM CITY coming in 2013... It will be this, but better and MMO style.:-)"
1,This game takes up too much memory!!,"I cannot even get to play it, since it requires so much memory. Out 32.95"
4,"Fast service, nice to be able to get an older album",My husband was looking for Dean Martin Christmas songs that he remembered from his childhood. The album was just what he was looking for.
4,very mary .... merry too,Why the heck do I have to write areview? They aren't paying me jackto utilize my literary skills. Ifyou want this thing then just orderit.
5,"Klein Tools 12098 8"" Universal Side Cutting Pliers","I carried these on my belt for several years and they've been excellent as long as i've used them.Anyone who knows the difference between a real tool and cheap junk will understand what to expect.The crimping die actually does an excellent job, though it's a pinching hazard sometimes.the long jaw body gives them a bit better reach in tight spaces than the regular lineman's pliers.The only thing i would like is a version with the hardened 2000 series cutting jaws.Even at that, these are just about the perfect mixed-use fixed joint pliers you can find."
2,Glorified FAQ on the basic household chemicals,"I got this book because I wanted to learn more about cleaning products and particularly degreasers. This book has absolutely nothing on degreasers, even though there is a whole chapter on Garage chemicals.The format of the book is like an FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions). It's not an encyclopedia of household products as you may suspect from the publishers description. It covers just the very basic products/chemicals and doesn't go in depth on anything in particular. There are no pictures or diagrams, just text.I would not recommend this book. I'm still looking for a good book that covers a wide variety of household chemicals in detail."
5,Springform Pan,"Love Love Love these pans. They are great i use them mostly for cheesecake absolutely great,"
2,Great starter set,"Great for my cake baking needs. Used it extensively and it comes clean every time, with no leaking. Washing by hand is simple with some soapy water. Just wished it came in 9'' for use with some of my more standard cake recipes.**** Update. I friend used this a few weeks after I bought it to make cheesecake and the entire hinge mechanism broke off. Poor product quality."
5,Just what I needed,"This is a very nice set of pans. I've used them several times, and they've performed perfectly well. The price can't easily be beaten either, especially being a 3-pack. Overall very pleased, would buy again!"
2,Spring form only if greased well.,Cate pans need to have a lot of spray Pam on them.... Otherwise they are great.
2,Barely used...,"I thought they were going to be a good investment. When I tried using them for a simple cheesecake, they leaked all over my oven."
1,Leaks,Spring form pans may work for solid batter/dough but cake mixes or anything runny will leak out the bottom. I found that out the hard way.
2,Fell Apart,"I am a little bummed as the second time I used the medium sized pan, the latch on the outside broke rendering the pan useless. The price was good so I thought I'd give it a try, but the quality is lacking."
3,Not as descirbed,"This is a plain, reasonably priced black plastic license plate frame. It fits my standard plate just fine.However, there are no screw covers enclosed, attached or included. So there is an unfinished effect since the heads of the screws (which I ordered separately) are exposed.I think license plate frames are primarily bought for appearance and the ""missing"" screw covers detract from the appearance."
4,Good value,"This book is a very good value for the price. Nice selection of Michelangelo Merisi's paintings. If you are on a budget and would like larger versions (full page or so) of some of his most famous works, this is a great choice."
4,A+ at the price,I've seen nicer books coming in at several hundred dollars but for the ~$5 you really can't beat this one Plenty of beautiful full color plates this makes an excellent student edition and a reference book for home. If you're purchasing for an all out art reference library you should look into a different edition.
4,Great Pop/Rock Tunes from Brazil,"This record came out in the summer of 1985, and featured a few hits in Brazil, including ""Choque"" and ""Primeiros Erros,"" two catchy pop songs. While the production techniques are a bit dated 20 years later, the songs themselves show a high quality of writing ability."
3,I wish I knew what Bo Knows,"This piece is a look at the upbringing of Bo Jackson. He discusses his past and what brought him to his successes in life. It is watered down with numbers and flashbacks of games that not many remember. The saving graces in this book are the stories in regard to charitable works Bo has done, as well as Dick Schaap and his mid chapter-per chapter writings.This book is good for the twitch speed generation of parents to own to let their children one day know what the words: ownership, accountability, and work ethic really mean. Success is sometimes an afterthought.~Angelo Markantonakis"
3,now I know bo,I knew nothing of Bo Jackson before this book. I enjoyed the stories of his youth and now have a new found respect for a truly respectable person. Bo Jackson should serve as a model for all current athletes.
4,Easy to use,"This program is a joy to use,the options for formating and editing are endless ,works very good on my old computer with Windows 2000 system. Prints very nice cards. The address labels are professional also does good job on envelopes and gift tags etc."
5,Great Product,"I really like the selections it give you, I have an older verison and I loved it. I wanted something more updated and with more of a selection and thats what I got!"
4,Greenville OH reader is dead wrong,"Mr Haviza should stick to the comic books. Not only does this book provide recipes comparable to starbucks, it gives insight on how to tweak starbucks a little to bring out even more boldness. So Mr Haviza, just read the book again. This time without Abby sitting on top of you in all of her glory, although that is a pretty sight i might add"
1,A basic outline,"Maybe I didn't read int the information enough prior to purchasing this book, but I found it to be very basic. More like a text book than a recipe book. Lots of history and background information, and slim on the recipes. Most of this information you can easily find on the internet. I was looking for a guide to make what you might buy and Starbucks, and though a couple might be here I think it is a far cry from how they actually do it. This book was published in 1993 maybe things have evolved since then."
2,For the beginner,"Mathew Tekulsky has set forth clear information and instructions for the begiining barista. He offers decent tips for making a good cup (Use fresh water, the importance of the proper grind, don't boil the water, and clean your equipment regularly). He explains clearly the various methods for brewing (drip, French press, vacuum method, the percolator etc.) And, of course, he has info about making espresso properly.Most of the book consists of recipes, and I appreciated knowing the difference between, for example, the Cappuccino and the Cappuccino Royale (the Royale is a Cappuccino topped with whipped cream, and often with almond, rum, brandy, mint, or vanilla extract).If you're a beginner, it's useful to have this information all in one place, but I must say that most of this is readily available on the Internet. And, you don't need this book if you have some coffee-brewing experience."
3,Pretty disappointed in this book.,"There is only one recipe for espresso drinks. There are other recipes for drinks with brewed coffee, but they have ingredients that most people do not normally keep in their house. The sections on the history of coffee and some tips on how to make a better coffee/espresso, are pretty good. If you are looking for some recipes for some different drinks, this is definately not the book you are wanting. I'm going to keep the book only because I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it, but I will not be recommending it to anyone to buy."
2,It's ok,I'd hoped there'd been more recipes. This book gives very basic information and shows little creativity. Explore further if you're wanting a real recipe book to make flavored coffees.
3,A history / cultural lesson,If you want to know all about the culture and art of coffee making then buy this book. If you want a bit of help to impress your friends than this is not the book.
5,The Best for Puget Sound and the San Juan Islands,"After 10 years of cruising and teaching sailing/cruising skills in this area, and this is the best guide to all of the US waters of Puget Sound and the San Juan Islands. Should be on all charter boats, but often is not, so if you are chartering inquire.Add a ""BBA Chart Kit"" for detailed charts, and for the Canadian Gulf Islands ""The Dreamspeaker Guide,"" and you are set!Finally, adding this season's ""Waggoners"" guide will give you the latest contact information for marinas, etc."
3,Older than expected.,"Have the newer Paper back by author,was hoping for different information. Book was in great shape,no trouble with seller just buyer"
4,WOW...,"What a different story. Love, mystery, a great hero and an evil sick man. I have read just about every book Jane Feather has written and I absolutely liked this one. Highly recommend for a different story line."
4,speculative.,i really liked this book it had alot of qualities i liked however i thought that Juliana was alittle too childish i mean trying to get back at Redmayne in the most obsurd ways her character needed just a little mor maturity but i liked the book in general it had alot of humor in it and one thing that the two character were not perfect Juliana being clumsy and all added a certain charm to it. it's worth a read.
2,Useful on the Kindle? Not so much!,"Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases (Deluxe Edition)OK, it's the famous Thesaurus, and that's great. But the Kindle description says""The Edition presented here is copiously and efficiently hyperlinked for ease of use for the expeditious results that you may require."" To which I will add a big Bronx cheer. No it is NOT copiously and efficiently hyperlinked, and it is not at all easy to use. I love my Kindle, but where this book is concerned, best stick with the ink-on-paper editions. And to the person who wrote the line I quoted above: maybe you should get a job in politics where half-lies and whole lies to consumers is normal."
1,Juiceman Jr. Juicer- JM1,I had used my Juiceman Jr juicer two times and was thrilled. The third time I was half through with my vegetables when I smelled a burning smell and it quit working. I let it cool and still it did not work. Taking it back and guess I'll try to locate another type.
1,Not worth carrying home,"The very first time I used this product I smelled a burning smell. After checking it out closer, it was damaged and I never was able to make any juice. Would not recommend this model."
4,Great juicer for the price.,"We have had this juicer for 10+ years and while we do not use it daily, we have used it quite a bit over the years.It works great, is easy to clean. Only two negative points: 1) very loud; and 2)the pulp shoot is open and the box for catching the pulp simply sits up ""against"" the juicer. We have to take a plastic grocery bag and put it in the pulp catcher and pull it up over the end of the chute to keep the pulp from going EVERYWHERE. That does make discarding the pulp very easy and the pulp box stays clean. This juicer has held up very well. Runs just as good today as it did 10+ years ago."
5,Works Great!,I have used this product for years even on the discs scratched very bad. I rent movies for the grandchildren and they are always in bad shape. The Skip Dr has come through every time.
2,A Weak Series.,"This is a compilation of old ""talking heads"" docoswith the minimum of production values.Don't bother, there are better up to date DVDs around."
4,Fast and reliable card reader,"Bad news is you need Windows 98 or Windows 2000 to use this media reader. Product description should include this caveat. Good news is the media reader works reliably and very fast. Using my serial connection from my digital camera to my computer, it takes overnight to download my 128 MB card. Using this USB reader, the 128 MB card downloads immediately. It's like accessing local files. This product is so popular at the local digital camera store that it is often sold out."
1,NO XP DRIVERS!!!,I have one of these and it worked fine with W/2000. But I was quite unable to find an XP driver for it. General advice: Never try and use a pre-XP driver on XP. You can blue-screen yourself on startup.
1,The Microtech USB card reader definitely makes Win2K crash!,"I have a Win2K PC (Win2k Pro, SP1 - SP4) whose Windows Explorer has beencrashing randomly for several years but I could not figure out why. Untilrecently.I built a new PC (ASUS motherboard, P4 3.0GHz, 1 GB RAM etc.) and installedWin2k plus SP1 through SP4. Then I installed software. I kept track ofeverything I was installing, in case I needed to re-install. Everythingworks hunky-dory until I installed the Microtech USB card reader stuff.*THEN* Windows Explorer starts crashing randomly, just like on my otherWin2K PC.Just as a test, I then installed the Microtech USB card reader stuff onmy home Win2K PC, which also has Win2k Pro, SP1 - SP4. Lo and behold,its Windows Explorer starts crashing randonly too!!@#$%^&*![UPDATE, Aug 22 2005:A cure for the random crashing of Windows Explorer is to uninstallthe Microtech driver. Stupid poorly tested software!]"
4,"Choosing Simplicity, Choosing Technology","This is a book about a very well-educated (in the formal, MIT, technological sense) man and his wife who take off to a rural area for a few seasons and learn to live with less technology. Partially, this book is about mennonites and the Amish, but the heart of the book lies in the couple's issues with technology, or the choosing not to use technology. This is not an overly moralistic piece about completely unplugging (they have their car for most of the book), this is about actively thinking about what technological items are actually useful for individuals, and which items are simply owning and (gasp, yes) controlling their ""owners"". That is the lesson I walked away with.As far as writing style, the author is crisp and simple, to the point of being a bit too simplistic at times. An easy read in terms of sentencing/vocab. Would have loved a bit more on the culture they placed themselves in, and the end feels a bit rushed. Nonetheless, it was worth it."
4,Great Read.,"About two years ago I heard about this book and became fascinated by it. Finally I bought it (through Amazon) I read it and it has stayed with me. I have told many people about and let them borrow it.The idea of living without any modern technology is one that is intriguing. The Brendes'adventure is exciting to read about.The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that I thought that parts of the book was long winded, other then that it is a great book."
4,a great read,"admittedly I could have used a dictionary in my other hand to check the definitions of several words. Eric is very well educated and he expresses himself vividly. I found this book and the adventure he & wife Mary set out on to be quite intersesting.As a person that is interested in ""simplifying"", his commitment to his plan was amazing. I found the details of their temporary home to be very interesting & unusual. I was bit disappointed to find he & his family living a more ""dependant"" life, but I guess it wasn't a fairy tale."
5,"Seeking the simple life gets complicated, but pays off","Most of us are immersed in consumer culture. We live our modern lives completely dependent on technology, yet completely independent of and disconnected from our neighbors. Even if we stop to question our lifestyle, we do little to change it. That's why I admire Eric and his wife for having the courage of their convictions to leave technology behind for a time and honestly share their story--their work, their joys, and their failures--with us. This is not a weighty treatise on comparative economics or environmentalism, but rather one family's excursion into a difficult but rewarding alternative lifestyle. But more than that, it is a story of what it means to be part of a community. Brende's book reads like a friend's diary; he questions himself as much as his society, and learns as he goes along. An entertaining and thought-provoking book."
2,Left Me Cold,"The writing is prosaic, the contemplation is shallow -- the narrative is worth no more than a blog, with apologies to the occasional blogger worth reading."
2,2 stars for the author for lasting the full 18 months,"I found his book to be less informative than I had expected. I also found it interesting that when push came to shove, literally and figuratively, he ended up desperately looking for a phone and a car. It seems that the author has a way of justifying to himself when it was or is OK for his family to use technology. The first thing he and his wife did after their baby was born was go to a Kmart. Did I read that right? Pleeeeese. There were no new revelations in this book nor did he back up anything with interesting scientific facts, like how much energy our country uses, how much water we waste or how much garbage, pollution, etc., we create and how his experiment addressed these social problems. I don't think he really cares. What I read was a story about a kind of lazy, full-of-himself guy looking for a way to have more leisure time. There are a lot of better books out there on the subject."
3,Good but...,"It's a well written book but I was hoping for more details about their everyday life of living without electricity. Instead, the book is mostly about the grand idea of living without modern technology.I also wish we got more input from his wife's perspective and what her daily life at home and in the garden was like. She became pregnant halfway through their experiment so that was more intrigue we could have learned about but Mr. Brende hardly touched upon her experiences. It's a shame really, this book had a lot of potential."
4,A wholistic view,"Eric Brende gives us an excellent insight into his reactions to physical, manual work. At first he was intimidated by it, expecting it to be difficult and boring. He however discovered that by working along side other people that the manual work got done but it was not the main focus; the social attributes of the work overrode the manual labor and actually made it enjoyable. An inspiring read!"
3,"Interesting topic, poorly written","This book is an interesting topic about how the author turned his back on modern life to live a more agrarian lifestyle, but it is poorly written. The words and descriptions seem strained and phony. The characters are one dimensional like the whole thing is a grade school children's story. The author is not good at making you feel like you're in his shoes and part of the experience like so many other authors are capable of doing. I enjoyed the premise, but not the execution -- it felt like reading a rough draft. Either he's a bad writer, or he had a bad editor, or both."
4,Book Club - Amazon.com comes through again!,"I can always count on Amazon.com to get my book club selections to me on time. This book (Better Off) was a paperback, but was in fine condition. I was intrigued to visit homes (via reading) that shun electricity and other conveniences that we take for granted. At the end of the story, you wonder what we have sacrificed to have these conveniences. Thanks for a good read."
3,Interesting but very dense,"This book has a lot of great information but it is very densely written. To me it seems more like a research/term paper than a book for the general public. While she does explain things in laymens terms, there is a LOT of data and facts thrown in that are tedious to read. Overall, I'd recommend the book if you are having multiples because it does bring up a lot of points to consider as your raise your kids. The biggest point for me was the differences in fraternal and identical twins and how they really are different and not all just ""twins."""
2,Not that great.,"I have been playing golf off and on for the last 3 years and I have never seen a set of balls come out of the package with so many blemishes. I have not played with them yet but there are a few balls that we just can't play with. I can see the seam where the outer coating comes together and one of them has a protruding spot where there should be a dimple. Anyway, I will play with the good ones tomorrow but I don't foresee me switching from my Pinnacles anytime soon."
2,Cruisers,"We have a power boat but found this book to be very informative & helpful. We are planning our trip, have not been to the Chesapeake in about 25 years, and have found this book the best yet in our preparations. We like to anchor out and this book is informative not specifically focusing jumping from marina to marina like many guides do."
2,Not a particularly user- friendly guide.,"The book is very comprehensive so if that's what you want, this is for you. However, it is'nt in colour,and has a poor/non-exhistant mapping system so is not suitable for ordinary visitors to the Chesapeake. The Chesapeake Cruising Magazine's annual guide is a lot easier to use and has itineries to make life easy."
5,Superb Thermometer,"We've used two of this model Taylor Min/Max thermometer. They perform flawlessly in our greenhouse and on the back porch. We're getting two more; for one a well house and one for a barn. Taylor only makes precision instruments, so you can always rely on them."
2,Doesn't meet my needs,"I find this alternative to the mercury thermometer not as accurate. It may be fine for the sake of simple interest in the weather, but I keep data on my farm. This one just isn't good enough for me. I returned it and bought Taylor's mercury version."
1,WORST BOOK EVER!!,"The characters are ill-developed, one-dimensional and shallow. I thought at some point the author would redeem the sniveling protagonist and introduce a plot line worth reading. Needless to say, that is the only reason I finished this heinous book. I picked this up in an airport and after finishing this trite piece of garbage I realized my time would have been better spent staring at my tray table for the duration of my flight."
1,Not worth the 25 cents,"I have never watched Sex and the City nor read any Candace Bushnell. I enjoy an occasional easy chick lit read (Jennifer Weiner, Helen Fielding) and got this at the library's annual book sale for 25 cents. I too kept reading, thinking there had to be some reason Candace Bushnell is so famous, thinking it had to get better. It didn't. I found myself in that scenario where I can't decide if I should cut my losses or continue because I have invested so much time. The longer you read, the more the conundrum intensifies. Thus I finished all 500+ pages of this terrible book. No plot, no enjoyable characters, no redeeming qualities. Not sure how this got published."
4,I liked it. So sue me.,"I thought what the author did was pretty genius. She took a completely unlikeable heroine, and had you rooting for her by the end. IT was very Bell Jar, in the sense that this heroine is ""not all there"" but it was a fun read, and a sick look at a society where the men are rated on their bank accounts, and women by their looks.

4,Better than Sex and the City....,"Candace Bushnell's ""Trading Up"" is mesmerizing. I was glued to it for days. It's a nice long read. Fairly light reading...nothing to complex to figure out. Good summer reading. Great story about a Diva and her messed up life. Reminds me of Scarlett from ""Gone with the Wind""."
4,A very sexy story!,"I really enjoyed this book. If you like Sex and the City then you should like this. It is very similar. This being said, this book is not for everyone. If you are somewhat of a prude or if sex bothers you in ANY way don't bother reading this book. There is a lot of sex in it. I think it is a fun book and as long as you don't take it too seriously you will enjoy it. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to any of my friends...just not my mother (which is funny because she is the one that bought it for me! HA HA)"
4,Janey,"Wow, talk about a character you love to hate! I loved this book! It was pure trash, but that kind of high class, well written trash. Candace Bushnell leaves nothing to the imagination with Janey and her thoughts and antics. I've lent this book to a few friends and they all say they can't wait to see what she will have the audacity to do next. Makes you wonder if there really are people like that in real life. My guess is yes. Only one downfall for me and that was about 3/4s of the way through the book it did start to get a little long. And just when you think the ending will surely take the moral high-road and Janey will get exactly what's coming to her . . . she doesn't!"
3,"A Load of Fun, if You're a New Yorker & don't mind rip-offs","This book is loads of fun if you're familiar with the NYC glitterati (and geared for women)--however, be warned, it's satire doesn't quite cut the recipients as opposed to glamorize them. It's a bit on the fluff side The other problem with this book is that it has ripped it's entire character and plot from Edith Wharton's Customs of the Country (the publishers must know this as they constantly mention Wharton when describing Bushnell). If you want a great book that doesn't leave you slightly depressed by human vanity, ambition, and greed--pick up Customs of the Country. It's essentially the same, but with a more ironic tone and a better detachment (i.e. writer does not WANT to be the Beautiful Young Thing."
5,A window to the stupidities of the rich and powerful,"A well written book about unpleasant characters.We find no safe haven in loyalty, kindness and honesty in Trading Up, nor do we meet any decent women. Bushnell describes a world of raw bitterness, revenge, avarice and spite. I would have liked to see Selden Rose build some backbone, take Janey by the neck and squeeze. By the time one comes to the last page, one feels both envious and morally superior! Not a very pleasant feeling!Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?"
2,It does not get better,"I, like many of the readers of this book, kept reading because I thought the plot would develop. Please heed my warning...it does not get interesting, and the characters do not get the bad Karma they derserve."
2,Bleh - Not her best,"I listened to the audio version of this book on cd. And while Mira Sorvino is serviceable as a reader, I have to admit I kept waiting and waiting for the story to get better. I loved Sex and the City (as did everyone), so I thought this also might be a fun, fizzy diversion to make my commute pass more quickly each day. But instead I found the characters and dialogue banal and predictable and as others have pointed out, I couldn't bring myself to care about any of them. It neednt be great literature to be engaging, but even by ""chick lit"" standards I found this to be a disappointment."
2,blah,"This book was so disappointing because most of the time spent reading this book I was thinking, something great is going to happen. By the last chapter i was like, ""ok might as well finish it since I've gotten this far"". There were definitely opportunities in this book to make it fun, flirty and surprising, but there were no twists. Just when you thought something amazing, funny, or romantic was going to happen, it didn't. Nothing at all... And the whole book was like that. It was kind of sad at sometimes, and the main character just has this pathetic little life that is very meaningless. I thought it would be great because Sex and the City is/was such a smash hit, but I guess everyone is allowed to make some mistakes. This was one for Bushnell."
2,SO NOT IMPRESSED,HATED IT! I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BOOK...IT REALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER AS A TV MOVIE AS SOME OTHER REVIEWERS POINTED OUT....IT WENT ON...AND ON... AND ON...AND WAS A BIT TOO WORDY WHEN IT WAS NOT NECCESSARY...I'LL TRY ANOTHER BOOK BY HER.
2,There are better beach reads than this,"I agree with the majority of the other comments on this book. Overall the writing was not very interesting. The characters don't really grow and the endless drinking, clubbing, dating and drugging scenes become dull after awhile (if this is how Manhattan functions, boy do I feel sorry for those folks). I was hoping that Janey's constant evaluations of her situation would eventually lead her to enlightenment but it just doesn't happen. The events of Janey's past and the struggles in her marriage were the good parts of the book. If Ms. Bushnell's work included a maturity process that the characters desperately need, the stories would definitely improve."
2,No just desserts for protagonist,"I did read to the end and was very disappointed. I at least wanted to see a comeuppance for Janey Wilcox, the protagonist. Instead, after 500 pages, I just saw that the author planned to continue this saga into another book.Janey Wilcox was completely amoral and seemed to cause pain whereever she went."
1,Worst book I've ever read,"This book was terrible. Usually when I read a book with a character like Janie Wilcox, she is the antagonist and she finally get whats coming to her in the end. Well not in this book. She is the main character and all she does is use people to get what she wants. I was seriously hoping someone would do a drive by or push or out a 30 story window by the end of this book. I have never read anything else by Candace Bushnell and because of this book, I never will."
1,ok -,I haver tried to finish reading this book 5 times. It just doesn't hold my interest. I reccommend any other book. Try the Devil Wears Prada or something by Amber Gristak.
1,"Waste of time, even for summer reading","I loved the TV show ""Sex and the City"". I even enjoyed the original ""Sex in the City"" book. But this one, ""Trading Up"", was junk. I didn't even get through a quarter of the novel, and that says a lot for someone who was stuck in a cottage with no car and her entire extended family during a rainy week.E."
1,Disappointing...,"Janey, Janey, Janey. The fact of the matter is that after reading this book you still won't understand why she is who she is. After being such an avid fan of Sex & the City, I thought why not read a novel by Candace Bushnell. This book certainly screwed up the momentum. Janey is the most annoying character I have ever encountered in a book. Selfish, self absorbed, and stupid, she shows no growth at all and continues to see the worst in others while not examining herself. Don't buy this book, and I would encourage you not to read it...but if you do, borrow it from the library. If this book accomplishes anything, it is making you feel grateful that Janey Wilcox is in fact a fictional character that you will never have to encounter in real life!"
2,"Bored, Bored, Bored...","This is a book I'm just so happy I borrowed ftrom the library and hadn't bought. I was just curious to read something by Candace Bushnell after all the 'Sex and the City' hoopla.And boy, was I disappointed. While it wasn't the worst book I've ever read, and I could've continued to read this if I had nothing better to do (which luckily - isn't the case), I asked myself 'Why Bother?'. When I couldn't find a decent answer for that, I just put the book down, and believe me - it's going back to the library ASAP."
2,Too shallow,I bought the book thinking it would be on Candace's typical style of narrating one's character but also NYC. Was disappointed because there isn't much character development (as someone else mentioned here) and not too much intricacy about human nature. One of the possible reason being too many characters in the novel and in the end author tried to make a story. NYC is a great background to built a storyline (eg Woody Allen movies) but using it as a stage to make an orgy won't buy too much. Language style is too rubbish to make it a literary piece.
1,Candace Bushnell is the next Jackie Collins,"This book was a complete waste of my time. Trading Up made me want to re-think my policy on reading a book from cover to cover. I kept hoping that the book would bet better, but it never did. The story centers around a shallow, self-absorbed character named Janey Wilcox. There is nothing redeeming about Janey and she is not an interesting character. Couple this with a meandering plot and additional superficial characters who only care about money and thier looks, and you have the makings of a trashy novel.If you are looking for the same wit that Bushnell used in Sex and the City, don't pick up this book. Move over Jackie Collins, there is a new trash novelist in town."
2,Trading Down,"I was disappointed in Bushnell's newest book. Even though I was anxious to buy it after loving Four Blondes and being a faithful Sex in the City fan. The continued back flash of stories and events made this story run on forever and the actual story was lost in the shuffle. If Buschnell had just told the story of Janey Wilcox from beginning to end I have no doubr it would have been a good read.The book seemed forced, like Bushnell was trying to cover every detail down to the brand of mascara and give you a reason she used it and the entire history behind it. There was nothing left to the imagination.I'm disappointed that I spent $$ on the hardcover version. If you haven't read it wait for paperback, borrow it from a friend, or choose a different book."
