1,A Rock/Metal Lisenter that Knows Music,"Ok, limp bizkit went from metal.. to rap/ rock to rap! this is a 100% sell out. its all rap remixes and nothing rock, all my favorite songs are ruined. limp bizkit use to be my obsession, my favorite my idol and they are now not liked by me. GGEZ If you like striaght hardcore metal Check out Slipknot :"" Iowa""!"
4,I could NOT love this CD more!!,"I have read a lot of the reviews that are posted for this CD and found that most of them just made me mad! This CD rocks. I have not been a Limp Bizkit fan long..obviously not long enough to get stagnant and angry not to mention intolerant of change..but I KNOW that there are some good remixes here. This is not new material...hence the title ""New Old Songs.."" The songs are different enough to be new, but yet completely recognizable! I got this for X-mas and found that it was instantly my favorite CD. If you like different styles of music, including Limp's rock/rap style you will like this CD. It's true, the edge has been taken off of their sound with the songs found on the CD, butmaybe it was not an accident..this CD will appeal to a wider audience..is that a bad thing?"
1,(...),"this is (...).the other limp bizkit albums are excellent, but this is just a money making scheme by fred durst to get some more cash. The lyrics to 'take a look around' dont even go in rthym with the beat. And the hard/angry break stuff has been slown down so much its just (...) and you get no feeling from the song. Same goes for Faith. This album is just really bad, if you have to spend your money on any album this week go get Cypress Hill's new album, it's brilliant. Lets hope Limp Bizkits next studio album is up to the standard of their past attempts and not this (...), else they wont be around for much longer."
3,weak,"I wasn't a big limp fan, but after I'v heard some musics, I changed my mind in a lot, musics like, take a look around, rollin, my way etc etc rules, but this cd, is too far away limp bizkit style... the cd is to slow, the guitar is to weak... In my opinion only 2 or 3 musics worth listen"
1,100% pure [GARBAGE],"How could a band with good songs turn them into [garbage], they should play this to torture people..........."
1,Awful,"What is this?Ever since CSATHDFW was released, Limp Bizkit has went downhill. They released this album because they did not have nothing else to do and it is basically flaunting the Chocolate Starfish album all over again. This album is crap. Right from the start, you can tell that this album is awful. Some of the remixes have been around for ages (see Counterfeit and Faith/Fame Remix) and others I just cannot stomach. No one wants to hear 5 versions of ""My Way""! Some high points on the album: ""N2Gether Now"" and ""Break Stuff"". They are pretty cool, but just download them somewhere. Do not buy this record unless you actually appreciate what Limp Bizkit did on their last album."
2,THIS IS A NIGHTMARE,"i got this cd for christmas so thank God i didn't have to spend actual money on it. i am a die hard LB fan, but i could have wailed in agony when i played this cd. ""Break Stuff"" was unrecognizable, so was ""Nookie"" 5 versions of ""My Way""; did Fred get bored or something? ""Take A Look Around"" is a bright spot, but what's with the ""player, hater"" spiel at the end? The ""my way"" remix with P. Diddy was good and energetic, but i got tired of his ""this is the remix"" monotone in the background.OH God, i dread the next studio album; no one can replace Wes!! Please please tell me this is not the end of my beloved LB!"
1,Why this CD was made is beyond me.,"This has got to be the biggest joke the music scene has ever seen. Gee, let me think, now that Wes Borland there is nothing salvageable from this worthless band. Limp Bizkit have become mostly rap to appeal to the hip-hop nazis, Fred can't seem to mentally grow beyond 5 years of age, and now this junk known as New Old Songs was put out. I literrally laughed at the stupidity of what came out of my speaker. I had more maturity when I reached six years of age than Fred will ever have. Limp have literrally let their potential talent go to waste.Don't buy anything by them. It will be the biggest mistake you'll ever make in music buying."
1,"Hey Fred, what were you thinking?","I've been a loyal fan of Limp Bizkit for a while now and have their last 3 albums, which I have no complaints about. But this new remix album stinks! It's a watered down version of Bizkit's best songs in a rap style - very little to no metal here. I have nothing against rap, in fact I have quite a few rap CDs, but when I buy a L B album I'm ready to rock! The rap versions on this CD are so boring that I fell asleep listening to it. I like rap and rock with hard beats, and this just ain't it.To all other L B fans - save your money! This album will NOT get you pumped up like the others. It may appeal to strickly rap fans or to people who've never heard Bizkit before, but I can't picture any true fan getting into this (...)."
1,Stupid...,"okey dokey, first off, what does limp bizkit think they're doing? Their last two albums went downhill from each other, and this just proves that they're out of material ( and a guitarist) all the remixes are dumb and aren't worth listening to. I'm very sad that wes borland left, he WAS the the entire band, and i look forward to his side project's next offering. if you have any respect for this band do them a favor and save your money. hopefully they'll find a new guitarist quick and quit selling out to the public. C'mon guys!"
1,I am a huge bizkit fan but this...uhh...this...just read it!,"Limp Bizkit's 3 albums were the coolest. My list and ratings for them.3 $ Bill Y'all:4Significant Other:5CSATHFW (*** and ****):3They were all good. But this is just something you would see on the street next to a dog.I'm not blaming Bizkit, I'm blaming P Diddy, The Neptunes and all of those other d**does. If they just let DJ Lethal do them all, I would give this CD a 4, but come on! The Neptunes can't write a good song for sh*t. All of the other Bizkit albums should be worth $1,000, but this should be shoved up a turtles rectom. Bizkit, YOU RULE, The Neptunes, and P. Diddy, **** *** *** ******* **** ** ******!!"
1,I Hate To Steal Somebody Else's Line But...,"...for a good laugh, read any review that gave this more than one star. Limp Bizkit sold out right after Significant Other sold its first million. Get that and 3DB for some above average rap-metal. Avoid this and any other Bizkit garbage like the plague. Peace out."
2,Going downhill,"This is probably LB's worst album. With the absence of the guitarist, Wes Borland, LB couldn't make any new songs or new guitar tracks. All of the songs are remixes by P.Diddy, 8-Ball, The Neptunes, William Orbit and so on. The tracks that at least come close to being half good are probably Rollin' remix, My Way Willian Orbit remix, and Getcha Groove On remix.I would give this CD a 2/5. If you were gonna buy this CD then drop it, unless you're a real hardcore LB fan/hip-hop lover."
2,new cd,"why does limp bizkit try anymorewes borland left because he was tired of being pop3 dollar bill y'all was an amazing cdeverything after that well....ill just pretend there was no after thatAfter 3 dollar bill y'all, Limp Bizkit slipped into obscurity, maybe to one day create something as new and excitingat least in my mind..."
5,The CD is the shiz,"This CD is awesome, it's a great compilation, with a little less bite, it's nice to just chill too."
1,Don't waste your money.....,"Too slow, boring, boring, boring, boring....geez, I'm starting to fall asleep! Love Limp Bizkit, but don't waste your hard-earned $'s on this one. Way too slow-paced, didn't even bother listening to every song in it's entirety since it would have taken 10 hours (or at least it would have seem to!)."
2,ALBUM BOTCHES GOOD SONGS WITH REMIXES,"This album Limp Bizkit put out called ""New Old Songs"" is just a poor attempt to make some more money on old songs that are botched up with remixes.It is ashame that Limp Bizkit has to try to make an extra few bucks on its fans especially at Christmas time with this mess.If maybe the songs were recognizable remixes I would say okay, but with the destroyed ""My Way"" with the help of P. Diddy, and the remix of ""Nookie""...is it Nookie?To boot their are 16 songs on the album in which 7, yes 7 are the SAME SONG!, 2 remixes of ""Nookie"" and 5 remixes of ""My Way""! Ridiculous!In all you have 5 botched up versions of ""My Way"", and then DJ Monk gets his hands on ""Rollin'"" and it sounds like a plane crash that keeps on giving.I give it 2 stars for the only decent remix on the album thanks to Timbaland with ""Take A Look Around"", otherwise this album is a bust."
1,bad,"(...) the other limp bizkit albums are excellent, but this is just a money making scheme by fred durst to get some more cash. The lyrics to 'take a look around' dont even go in rthym with the beat. And the hard/angry break stuff has been slowed down so much you get no feeling from the song. Same goes for Faith. (...)"
1,Could Anything be This Bad?????,"Okay. Let's look at the facts. We have a band that is slowly dying out. The guitarest wants out and the fans are tired of all their music. Rock fans have always questioned the group because of their usual RAP mixed with metal, which isn't a great combination. They went way over to the bad side when they did songs with Method Man. But most fans ignored it. The group continues to hire rap groups such as P. Diddy and Neptunez (mainstream rappers) to do song remixes on this terrible album. Most of the beats are whack and this CD was just supposed to make money. There was no talent involved whatsoever."
1,"It's like Fred Durst took a dump in a cd recorder and called it ""good"".","I don't think I have to preach to this choir. If you have read all 1,000 reviews of this album you will realize that this album isn't even worth the plastic it was made out of. To be honest, I don't remember how I even got this album (I sure as hell know if I did buy it I didn't pay more than 50 cents for it). The beats sound terrible, the songs sound terrible, Limp Bizkit sounds terrible. People will call this band the Warrant of the late 90's early 00's. (Except Warrant was a hell of a lot better than this crap.)"
1,By not Listening to Limp Bizkit you will live longer.,Me and my lab crew have been doing many running on Limp Bizkit's music. The results show your intellegence quotient(IQ) decreases by 10% for every minute you listen to it. Don't buy this album and you will live longer. Ahh. I'm just kidding. You dont get stupid by listening to Limp bizkit. It's just bad music.
1,How low can they go,Thank amazon for the 'Listen to Samplesoption'. You just have to listen to 1 or 2 samplesto see how bad this albom is. It's just a 'makemoney' from Limp Bizkit poor fans.
1,This has to be a joke,"If this was a hip-hop tribute to Limp Bizkit, maybe I would have given it 2 stars, but Fred Durst decided to make it an official release. I wonder if any guitarists are gonna want to try out for Limp Bizkit after seeing what kind of music Fred wants to make. Wes didn't live up to his full potential when he was in the band, so its a good thing he left before this garbage hit the stores. All I want to know is why Fred and Co. needed to make this useless album."
2,Pretty bad,"I am a huge bizkit fan, and support them fully. But this album is straight up trash. Some of the songs are fun to listen to, but fore the most part it is a bunch of hip hop remixed crap."
2,Very Weak Effort,"Limp Bizkit is known for creating hard-hitting crash metal music. This CD is the opposite. All that you will find in this CD is a bunch of poorly remade songs that have been torn apart from their original versions. The beats looped behind the vocals don't match the songs very well at all. I am a rap fan as well and the rap vocals have been twisted around and many of them don't match the beats very well. What happened? The worst thing about this CD in my opinion is the fact that five remixes of the song ""My Way"" are present. Each one takes more and more out of the original."
1,I am a huge bizkit fan but this...uhh...this...just read it!,"Limp Bizkit's 3 albums were the coolest. My list and ratings for them.[Three Dollar Bill, Y'All]:4[Significant Other] :5[Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water](*** and ****):3They were all good. But this is just something you would see on the street next to a dog.I'm not blaming Bizkit, I'm blaming P Diddy, The Neptunes and all of those other [people]. If they just let DJ Lethal do them all, I would give this CD a 4, but come on! The Neptunes can't write a good song for [nothing]. All of the other Bizkit albums should be worth $1,000, but this should be [tossed away]. Bizkit, YOU RULE, The Neptunes, and P. Diddy [are not good]"
3,Average CD...,"Um... it's ok i guess... the remixes are good for a while, then get old when you really that you're just listening to a song that's not as good as the original. The best one's on there are N2Gether, Counterfeit, Take A Look Around, and... uh, maybe the remixes of my way aren't that bad either. If you've got nothing better to buy, get it I guess. Otherwise, spend your money on something else."
1,Seems like a desperate attempt to fatten the pocketbook...,"Sadly, that's ALL this album is. Bizkit hired a few no-name producers to ""remix"" their old material (which really wasn't even groundbreaking to begin with), and re-release it as an album that is wayy too overpriced. And you know why it's overpriced?BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT THE MONEY.Bizkit, pack up your stuff and go home already. We're sick of your antics and talentless existence."
1,This is just horrible,"You thought Limp Bizkit couldent get any worse than this,eh?Well you thought wrong then.This is by far their worst.Its just a cd full of remixes by artists like P.Diddy...And the songs sound worse than the originals.Plus,why are there SIX remixes of 'My way'?No one needs that.Just stay away from this album."
1,what the hell have they gone and done?,"I like Limp Bizkit, I have no shame in saying it, there first three albums were great and enjoyed them all. But what is this [garbage]!!??? There really is only about 2 to 3 minutes of 'new music' on there, it's just cut down into 4 second segments then repeated again and again for about 3 minutes to form a 'track', it makes you physically ill listening to it. I like every type of music, heavy rock, hip-hop r&b, even classical! but this really is the biggest pile of S*&T I've heard in years. Ugh, looks like it is the highway then Fred (after 5 re-mixes I'd damn well think so)"
1,The Most God Awful Album Ever!!!!,"Wow,here we have yet another brilliant album from the genius known as Fred Durst.This is quite a nice follow up to the wonderful Chocolate Starfish And The Hot Dog Flavored Water.Oh please,like anyone would actually believe that.This album is so horrible,that words cannot describe it.But this time,Fred Durst doesn't just torture us by himself,he recruits a bunch of other no talents like P.Diddy and Bubba Sparxxx.I mean,the regular albums were awful enough,but cheesy hip hop remixes of those awful songs!?It all sounds too horrible to be true.But guess what,it is."
1,Glad i stayed away from this one.,"I have never been the greatest limp bizkit fan, but everything deserves a chance. I've heard clips from this album, and i wish i hadn't. If there was a way to build a time machine that allowed me to go back in time, i would save myself ten minutes and warn the old me to never EVER listen to this garbage. I don't understand why hard hitters like p diddy, the neptunes, and the dust brothers allowed themselves to partner up with the greatest wigger alive, fred durst. Get it throuhg your head, fred: YOU AREN'T BLACK. SO PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, THE LOVE IF HUMANITY, STOP PRETENDING! If i were any of them, i would not want my name on this disgustingly wretched album. So with that being said, stay away from this album as if were an STD."
1,Uh-uh,"No. Not even a little bit. No.Unlike others reviewing this cd, I really liked CSHFW. I'm not ashamed to admit that. Rollin', My Generation, My Way, all good.Previous cd's, again, all good.This cd sucks. Really. It just sucks. Next...."
1,0 STARS,"WOW LIMP BIZKIT IS SO METAL HAVING A BUNCH OF RAPPERS REMIX THEIR SONGS IS WHAT ALL ""REAL METAL"" BANDS ARE DOING NOW. THROW AWAY YOUR POSER MORTICIAN, AND FLESHGRIND CDS AND POP IN SOME OF THIS BECAUSE THIS IS TRUE METAL. WHAT A JOKE. I AM AMAZED THAT A BAND AS GOD AWFUL AS THIS STILL STAYS AROUND FOR 4 YEARS +. ONLY ONE BAND AS BAD AS LIMP BIZKIT HAS LASTED LONGER (KORN). (...)"
1,THE END OF LIMP BIZKIT IS NEAR!!!!,"Thank god its about time. I've been waiting for their fall for years. With LB gone, the entire rap rock thing will crash and burn like the galm bands did exactly 10 years ago. I personaly am grateful. The rap-rock genre has been stale and boring for about 4 years now, with a bunch of posers and sellouts cashing in on the origonality of RATM and old-school Korn. I am hoping that something else new and fresh will come soon(like maybe the Chris Cornell + (former)Rage Against The Machine album due early next year). Everybody knows that the only creativity in the band was Wes, and now that he's gone Fred will probably make an all rap album (yes, an even worse rap album than this). Wow, with LB gone it's going to be an exciting time in music."
1,That new old method of taking people's money,"Make a remix album and call it brand new. Remix albums don't turn out well in general. New Old Songs is no exception. It doesn't matter how many times you remix My Way. This song sucks. It will always suck. Fred Durst turns anything he touches into crap. It's been proven. Rap is musically more subdued than rap rock. So rap producers often rob these songs of any energy they may have. Limp Bizkit takes enough money from their fans with their studio albums, no need to scam people through shameless remixes."
4,Not the best limp has done,"This cd is good. Good not great. I usually don't like remixes but these are good. I still think that the original songs are the best. If another album came out with 13 or 14 NEW songs, that would be what I like."
5,The Durst RROOLLZZ!!,This CD is tiiiight. I especially dig the way my way is on there 5 toimes!!!! The durst is so creative - thats why he released a cd of old songs instead of new ones. I don't know why wes borland left. Where will he be without the power of the DURST?
5,I've been waiting on this for months on End!,I've been waiting on this album what seems like forever. Just for one song. There is a Drum & Bass mix from one of the guys from Hallucination. DJ MONK. The Mix is Slammin. Glad to see the limpers voyaging out into different styles and genres of music. Well i get the cd and what to my suprise all the tracks were good. Well worth the money.Pick This CD Up! Don't Miss Out!
2,what is this?!?!?!?,I bought this cd a few weeks ago...and the remix's are terrible... the original songs are way better.....dont waste your money on this pile of $%!# it's not worth it.
1,Limp Bizkit?,"This CD defies everything that Limp Bizkit is. They are one of the first bands to successfull combind rap and rock to make a fresh new popular sound. I feel that this cd is ""too soft."" Limp Bizkit has a bunch of songs that are very well written with a good beat. I feel that the songs that they chose and chose to repeat and mix could have been better. If you are a Limp Bizkit fan like I am, I would advise you against purchasing this album."
1,Bottom Line,"Aight,I never liked Limp Bizkit,but i had respect for them on Significant Other and Three Dollar Bill,but they sold out on there 3rd cd,and this cd further proves that,fred lost respect from rock,so he tries desperately to be hip hop.Limp Bizkit is over."
1,Where's the guitar?,"This album is really boring. Nothing like the Limp Bizkit I know. There's no guitar at all. Its like when Wes left, so did all the rock music. Why did Fred make this album in the first place?"
4,Safety is Critical - another good product,"A rear red light on a vehicle may be the most important safety component. This light has the technology, illumination and multi-mode feature that helps gain attention of anyone viewing you from behind. A good product at a good price with longer battery life than incandecent lamps."
5,A really Great Light - The only choice really,"This light is at least twice as bright as anything else in it's class. I don't see any reason to have anything else. It has five flashing patterns, but I just use the ""use them all"" mode. Don't look directly at the LEDs, 'cause it will hurt your eyes. One reviewer stated that the light cuts out. I find that mine does when the batteries get low, or maybe some corrosion. It's always fixed by removing and twisting or replacing the batteries. Just check for brightness before you ride. If it hurts your eyes, well, it's working. You need one of these in back and one in front. Over half of all bicycle/car accidents are from cars pulling out in front of bikes."
4,"Great ligth, but batteries hard to replace","I have had this tail light for a year and a half, and I like it very much.However, when I had to change batteries yesterday (I use rechargeable batteries), I could not get them out of the unit. I got the one with ""+"" end up out using pliers, but I couldn't get a grip on the other one. I finally knocked the unit on the edge of a table to get the second battery far enough out to where I could get a grip on it.Unfortunate, the unit no longer works. I guess the shock of knocking it on the table broke something.If the batteries didn't fit so snugly, I would give this a 5-star rating.I'm now thinking about getting a Foxfire Commuter Tail Light(FB-262-R) to replace it. Unfortunately, I can't find any reviews of the Foxfire on the web, so I'm debating on taking a chance with it."
5,Cateye TL-LD1100,"I had the previous version of the TL-LD1100, the TL-LD1000 for a few years, and broke it in a crash.I replaced it with a Planet Bike tail light, but it was just too flimsy and kept flying apart when hopping off curbs.The TL-LD1100 is noticeably brighter than my older TL-LD1000, but looks identical to it.It's just as solidly built as the TL-LD1000.It seems to be more efficient on batteries, too.I like the AA batteries vs. AAA's, as they have more reserve power.How Cateye continues to improve their products is always impressive.Still the best dry cell tail light on the market."
5,Just Awesome !,Hats off to Enrique Chia . I am from South India and this Cuban Master playing from his heart and his fingers dancing on the piano are really soothing to the mind ..I tend to play it often when I am down ...helps me look at life with a Smile ...God Bless him for his good music .
3,Starting over,"Joanna Trollope's novels are generally rich in emotion and character. Perhaps because Next of Kin is one of her early works, it fails to match the standard she has set in such novels as The Choir. A relatively brief tale of loss, grief, attenuated hopes, and the rediscovery of love and forgotten dreams, Next of Kin has potential that it never truly reaches. Bet Ms Trollope could improve this greatly with a rewrite. As it is, she has done a good job of depicting characters who are locked within their own fears and accommodations, who manage to chip their way back out in much the same way as a baby chick in its shell. This story is worth reading even though it might have been better."
2,Soundbites not real information,"Not very inspiring, a lot of tired ideas and phrases. Every now and again there was something fresh, but I found the book lacking in content. One tip is to ""keep your filing system easy to use and understand"". That's it, that's the entire idea, no tips on how you might actually do that. I don't see how it's that useful as an idea without more information. So am I to understand that before reading this I was attempting to make my filing system complex and difficult to understand? Not awful, just not in any way life altering."
2,Meh,"There is something to be said for this scraper, it's somewhat effective. I purchased this to clean the back of my glass aquarium where I cannot reach with my trustyMag Float-130A Magnetic Cleaner for Acrylic - Medium - up to 125 Gallon. It didn't do a very good job and wasn't terribly easy to get at that perfect angle. I've found it far easier to use a razor blade edge to scrape off coralline algae (don't care for it on my glass) than to use the scraper and my tank is 24"" deep.There's certainly something wrong with a product if you'd rather use a straight razor blade and shove your arm into your aggressive reef tank, risking being stung by your lion or scorpionfish, or bitten by your eel, than use a scraper."
5,Its an insane movie,"Hey people all around the world. This movie is really insane. I love it.The story? Forget it. The picture quality? Well, its an old movie but ok (only 4/3)"
3,Vox Rocks,"A remnant from a time when Sarah's new age sensibilities overruled her more melancholic musings, and electronically atmospheric in the way only an 80's album can be. Though a bit amateurish and inconsistent, ""Touch"" is great fun for fans who wish to see their favorite Lilither in a very different capacity, and ""Vox"" rocks in a way no current Sarah song ever can."
5,This is Sarah McLachlan plain and simple.,I personally think this C.D. is her best work ever. Whenever I think of Sarah McLachlan and her music the songs that come to mind are Ben's song and Vox. I have been dancing to Vox for several years at clubs. This is a C.D. that is a must have for all Sarah McLachlan fans!!!
1,PLEASE PEOPLE! See this album for what it is!,"Yes, Sarah has gone on to make amazing records. The follow-up to this record, ""Solace,"" is miles above the terrible, adolescent earnestness that mires this record.Like Tori Amos' ""Y Kant Tori Read,"" this is an album that should remain sequestered from the main body of the artists work --- because it's so bad."
5,This is a GREAT album!,"I completely disagree with the previous reviewer from Canada who implores us to see the album for what it is and has the audacity to rate this album with just one star. I actually like this album better than Solace, which is at times, a bit too earnest. But really, you should own all of Ms. McLachlan's CDs since they're all great overall."
2,Sarah McLachlan does John Phillips Sousa,I'm sorry to say the marching band beat in many of the songs on this cd ruins the beautiful effect of Sarahs voice. The persistance of this beat is is a total migrane. I really missed Sarah on this one. I'm now searching for her cd's with Ashwin Sood on drums. I'm a major Sarah fan!
3,promise of things to come,"Okay I admit I don't own this album. Yet. But I do have Solace and Mirrorball and I will soon have Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. But I have heard the tracks, so let me explain Sarah's sound. On this album she shows her raw as-yet-undeveloped talent (she was only about 20 yrs old) and her old-world quasi-Celtic influence (she's from Nova Scotia). Hence the cover art. Fans of Enya or Lorenna McKennit (sp?) should be pleased.As she progressed through her career she became the preeminent female singer-songwriter. She has the lyrical novelty of Jewel, the folk simplicity of Indigo Girls, the mischievous mystery of Tori Amos, the earnest humor of Sheryl Crow, and the passion and vocal dexterity of Natalie Merchant. And, she's beautiful. Enough said."
4,A good debut,"Sarah McLachlan's 1988 debut ""Touch"" is a whimsical, angelic ride. The lyrics compared to her later works aren't well done, but her voice and instrumention is beautiful. Every song is worth listening to. A great album."
4,Still My Favourite McLachlan album,"What seems like a long, long time ago, I spent some time as Music Director at a teeny-tiny radio station. One day, I got a 12-inch promotional for a new artist, featuring a couple of mixes of a song, 'Vox.' Two mixes went into rotation right away!Both mixes of 'Vox' are on the album and they both move me to this day, as does the entire album. (It might just be nostalgia, but, hey, there is it. :) ) The Sarah McLachlan heard on 'Touch' performs with a different style than the one we hear today. The style of 1980s popular music echoes strongly here, but McLachlan takes these elements, embelishes upon them, and creates something unique and exciting.Stand-out tracks are ""Out of the Shadows,"" ""Strange World,"" ""Trust,"" and the aforementioned ""Vox."" The melodies and instrumentations of these hold up extremely well to the passage of time and McLachlan's vocals positively sparkle."
4,Great overview of Sardou's career and most famous songs,"All Sardou's most famous songs are gathered on this double CD. 38 titles that make you feel like singing along with him all the way, and lift your spirits..."
5,Why doesn't everybody use these?,"Simply put, this is the best value on the market today for wiper blade refills. The silicone blade is absolutely head-and-shoulders above the conventional rubber competition at any price. Simply put the refill into any conventional wiper frame, and you've got what is essentially a budget version of a $25-30 PIAA wiper, and all for under $10, assuming you already have a frame. Beware though, this is actually a metric part, so make sure it fits the frame you're putting it in. I had to go to the scrapyard and pick up a cheap Bosch frame to put it on, because my 15"" Rain-X frame was about a half inch too short."
1,Breaking Through is a poor source book for vocalists,"Breaking Through is one of many books written by so called 'famous voice teachers of the stars' who don't really have any solid technique and want to make money talking about their former now famous students. This book is filled with many quotes, stories, and advice from a wide range of people, some of who are familiar, others not, which takes up most of the space in the book. There is little in the way of Ms. Bennetts special vocal technique that we wouldn't get out of any other beginning book. This book has inconsistent and incorrect information. For example the author claims that there is no such thing as voice registers and then goes on to tell you how to eliminate voice registers. There in contradictory information in many other important areas as well. I have taught voice for 10 years in all styles of singing. In my opinion this book is poorly written, self serving and not a good source for vocal technique."
1,Choose Another Vocal Book,"The vocal training and theory information in this book is not any different than some of the better vocal books available. There are some informative moments that can actually be used however, I and some of my students feel that the author spends too much effort on ""knocking"" other teachers and techniques, in addition to referencing to specific people that she prides their ability to herself, instead of just explaining the techniques, which we are looking for when we buy a book to learn. ""Never buy a book by it's title""."
2,Poorly written and self-promoting,"Althought there are some good points in this book, I found it very poorly written. Her explanation of breathing is detailed, but inaccurate. However, you can gain something from the general concepts. Her chapter on ""How to find a good teacher"" tells you to avoid teachers with poor motivations and poor techniques, but she never ""paints the perfect teacher"" as she promises. I found this pattern throughout the book.I was annoyed with the chapter on Gloria's ""famous"" students that did not add to the purpose of the book. The book was obviously not proofread. The all too frequent missing words and misplaced grammar made for slow reading.I must mention that I liked the section with vocal exercises and the explanations, as well as some of the voice care instructions. This book was a disappointment, with a few useful highlights."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Most photographs in this book are black and white, only several pages contain pictures in color. Not very attractive projects. Although there is a good section on variety of stitches with photographs, explanations could be better. Overall, okay book but I would not have bought it if I could look at it first."
4,Stars and candlelight,"I first heard David Wilson performing live at Il Cielo restaurant in Beverly Hills, many years ago. It was a starlight summer evening, we were dining outdoors, and David strolled from table to table, serenading each couple in the best European tradition. His wonderful violin music added immeasurably to the old-world romance of our dinner, and I ended up buying two copies of ""There's a small hotel"" on the spot. This CD is highly recommended for lovers of romance and European nostalgia."
4,Most Enjoyable Listening,A very nice easy listening CD in the Divid Wilson manner. The Romance of Paris is still my 5 star favorite CD.
3,Received on Time but the item was damaged,Received on Time but the item was damaged --returned and got a new setNext time i will not purchase Bars from Amazon.Its easy to purchase from store
2,. . . The PF's Greatest Hits . . . Not Quite . . .,"Arista's lack of care & concern for detail shines brightly in this disappointing compilation! While it may be true that the majority of the songs do indeed belong to the ""Partridges,"" there are two which clearly do not -- ""Cherish"" & ""Could It Be Forever"" -- both of which can be easily located on David Cassidy's first solo album (1972's ""Cherish"").A little bit of research goes a long way!"
1,The worst,"The lyrics are trite and sappy. The music bland and generic. The production is utterly unoriginal and soulless. This is teeny bopper product at its worst, and that there are still people who want to hear it is a sad commentary on how crass, cynical, and thoroughly manipulative marketing still pays off."
4,Lunchbox-First Family Of Rock's Greatest Hits,"Also known as Lunchbox this now defunct release by Arista came out in 1989 and tooted 16 of their greatest hits. Although the theme song ""C'mon Get Happy"" was not a hit is happily included here to set the theme as well as two of David's solo hits ""Cherish"" and ""Could It Be Forever"" which shows a little insightful research could go a long way. I personally believe Arista should have recognized David's solo potential both then AND now and put out a separate solo greatest hits for him. Curiously absent are any singles from ""Crossword Puzzle"" which may have spawned no hits but neither did ""Bulletin Board"" but the cut ""How Long Is Too Long"" (a great song though!) is in the mix here. The collection DOES include most of the Family's biggest hits and it DOES make for a fun listen! All the power house tunes are here so C'mon Get Happy!"
5,Brings back very many happy memories as a boy.,"This really brings back very happy memories of my younger years as a boy. David Cassidy had an excellent voice and the music was pleasant. I did miss ""Breaking up is hard to do"". The pictures of the original album covers were excellent and bought back many good memories. I had a crush on Susan Dey as a young boy, and used to watch the T.V. series as much to see her as to hear the music. Very well done indeed. (Viewed August, 29, 1999.)"
5,Love this recording,"I totally disagree with the viewer who panned this recording. I bought this recording many years ago and lost it in a move, and am re-ordering it now. I find the pianoforte version of these sonatas and Newman's playing of them to be refreshing. There are many great standard versions of these recordings but the energy that Mr. Newman displays on these recordings, coupled with the unique sound of the instrument give a vitality to these recordings (especially during the fast movements), that the traditional recordings lack."
2,Blu-Ray Transfer is Pure Trash!!!!!,.....I Bought the Robocop on blu-ray Expecting something special but boy was i dissapointed....theres absoloutely no diffrence in picture quality compared to the DVD and they have the Audacity to charge more $$ for this Trash Transfer....if you buy Robocop on Blu-Ray you will have A DVD in A blu-RAy case...purely for die hard FANS only...definitely not Worth the Money...NOT RECOMMEMDED!!!!!!!!!
3,"Blu-ray review, not movie review","It's like everyone's said before. Good movie, bad transfer to Blu-ray. Not necessarily bad, just not as good as others, so it doesn't meet many people's expectations. I'm not going to re-hash what others have complained about. I still enjoyed the movie, and for the price I think it was worth it. There definitely could've been more special features, and the transfer to Blu-ray could've been done better. But you can't get enough ""I'd buy that for a dollar!"" And the techno-like beat ""Robocop, dance till you drop, do the Robocop"" running through your head for hours on end is priceless."
5,One of the Best,"Loved it when I was a kid that was really too young to be watching this kind of movie and love it still as an adult who watched it last night. Its amazing how well this movie holds up. It some instances you realize its from a different decade, but for the most part it could have been shot today and seemed very relevant and styled for the present day.I won't get into the details of the plot or acting, but I'll say if you like action movies that don't pull any punches when it comes to violence while at the same time using that violence effectively to tell a story, you'll enjoy this movie. It may seemed dated, but it has moments that strike a cord perhaps even more so today than it did twenty years ago when this was ""science fiction"". Now it just seems like this could happen any day now."
3,Don't be fooled by the cover. (BD Review),"Even though this shares the same cover as the 20th Anniversary DVD, none of the features are carried over with the exception of a theatrical trailer. Other than that, the only plus side is that you get the high def movie. However, the movie itself isn't the best transfer job I've seen. I've seen older movies transferred better. Don't get me wrong, it's decent-but I personally feel that it could be better. To put it simply, unless you are a huge Robocop fan, don't bother. Any DVD version of this movie that you have will do the job."
5,Robocop Rules!,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Sure it was ultra violent, but strangely enough, It wasn't as violent as I expected it to be. There were only two parts I considered extremely-ultra violent. The first one is when ED-209 blasts the OCP guy to death. The second is when Boddicker and his thugs shoot Murphy about 20 times with their shotguns. The part where one of the thugs falls in to the toxic waste is pretty gruesome. The ending is great. It completely sets up for the 2nd movie. I recommend this movie for anyone over the age of 13 who can stand extreme violence."
3,Extremely violent,"""Robocop"" is a well-produced movie with talented actors, slick special effects and an exciting story. However, I was turned off somewhat by the extreme, and I do mean extreme violence. I usually don't get put off by that, but ""Robocop"" made me cringe a few times. Much of this film is bleak and gloomy, and it's definitely not for kids."
5,Robocop is Awesome!!,"this movie is an older one but is still a great movie, i highly recommend watching this one, i will definitley watch it again!"
4,the future of law enforcement,"This is a pretty good film and when I first saw it, the scene where Emil gets toxic waste covered on him was pretty scary, as we watched him horribly melt away then get splattered. Robocop is often considered a joke, but this film is quite powerful, in violence especially."
4,"Great movie, good DVD, all in all ""Pretty neat""","Sure there a slew of cyborg movies, but none of them have the heart that Verhoeven's RoboCop has. It is for me, about the triumph of human spirit over technology and big buisness. What kept me from giving this five stars, was that the transfer wasnt all that great, and the audio was only in 4 channel digital surround, not AC3 like the box says. However what I did love about this DVD was the audio commentary by Verhoeven. I find my self now enjoying on two different levels, one just for carnage and fun, and the other on a more philosophical level. Verhoeven goes into the Christ/RoboCop metephor thoroughly, a great extra if you enjoy a filmakers insight."
4,Verhoeven is awesome!!!!,"""Robocop"". This is the ultimate action video! Director Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Showgirls, Starship Troopers, etc..) has done an excellent with the ""superhero"" theme. I t all start with a cop who get transferred to crime-filled ""Old Detroit"" and after a few days he is savagely killed by a gang of drug dealers. He is them transformed by the police department into a high-tech crime-fighting machine! Warning: This is an extremely violent motion picture. Available on DVD and Laserdisc in a unrated director's cut, which features footage that the MPAA though was ""excessively violent"", this footage was cut to avoid a X rating. MPAA Rating: R for graphic violence, drug use, some nudity and strong language."
2,robocop criterion dvd review,"this is a terrible transfer to dvd of a great movie, there is so much snow and digital messiness and the soundtrack is even lousy. do yourself a favor and buy the regular dvd version of robocop as it boasts an excellent picture and soundtrack. stay away from this version. it has less than 60 seconds of additional footage which by todays standards are nothing really gory. the quality of the transfer is pathetic."
1,Robocop DVD,I received a Robocop DVD case with no DVD in it. Needless to say I wasn't too happy and got the runaround when I tried to get my money back or a replacement.
1,Yeah so about posting pictures of the steelbook version...,"This isn't it - I would have rather bought that off a used seller for like two bucks more. Not only that, the movie arrived with the not metal case broken and both the discs came tumbling out when I opened it - not cool"
3,Robocop BD edition,"Blu-ray version of Robo.Not really much here, it's the original theatrical version. Others have reviewed the movie itself, just wanted to add that the extra footage of ed209 shooting the executive is not in this version. Transfer...actually not very good. I have the special edition that has the extra footage in it, and on my upscaling dvd player (1080i) it looks nearly as good. Beyond that the special features are minimal and the audio was merely ok. Too bad, I wanted this to be better.With all that said, the price for the blu-ray makes it a good buy, especially if you don't have this in your collection. For the rest of us who like the gore and violence as it was intended...I'm sure a special edition will come out someday."
3,R-rated alert!,"This is the R-rated theatrical cut that is being sold everywhere since its release on home video format. From VHS to LD and now to DVD!MGM had the cojones to release this truncated version knowing full well that consumers are still going to buy it anyway because it's the first and best robocop movie. If you don't mind spending a little more, get the whole robocop trilogy boxset, that's where the unrated version resides. If you just want the unrated version of this movie, I suggest you either:1. Wait for another MGM reissue (MGM sure loves doing this! Look at Raging Bull and Fargo)2. Get the Criterion Collection title from eBay or Amazon marketplace. It may be a little pricey, but it's a good buy, just from its cover.3. Get the UK region 2 DVD from Amazon UK. Before doing that, make sure your DVD player is region free. (Come on, why restrict yourself to a certain region? Enjoy the best of both worlds!)"
3,"Great Film, Not Too Great DVD","I love the film, ever since I was 11 years old I have loved it! I assumed that the Criterion edition would have it all. But really all it has is a ""Director's Cut"" of the film, the transfer and the sound isn't that great. First off, the soundtrack is in 2.0, not 5.1 and the transfer of the video is kinda shabby and I don't think it's anamorphic either. But, the other DVD version of the film is the same except that it isn't the ""Director's Cut"", so for now the Criterion is the best you can get, it just isn't that great!"
3,Picture Quality isn't that Good!,"I have a very nice collection of movies on Blu-ray now & still growing (Many Thanks to Amazon ...the Best online store ever!!!) The Picture Quality on the blu-ray movie ""Robocop"" was a little grainy & I was very disappointed.However,I'll keep it because it just happens to be a favorite of mine & Blu-ray is the Best Format for movies."
4,A sci-fi masterpiece!!,"This is one of the best Sci-fi films ever made, in its full uncut form. Ok so it may be a little more graphic, but that's how the director originally wanted it to be, and to me it does make the film more enjoyable, under-lining the importance of those extended scenes. The quality of this edition is rather good, with image quality really high, although only releasing it in Dolby Surround seems a bit of a waste (but you can still get very good sound reproduction when played though a good DD amp). All in all a film that any Sci-fi fan will love, and if you havn't seen it yet, it's definately worth grabbing!!!!"
5,better then terminator,"All i have to say about this film is that it's great and extremely violent,it's way better than the terminator series,it's full of action,blood and futuristic dark inviroments and dark violent humour,if you love gory films you gotta see this one for sure."
5,Good movie,"Great sci-fi movie, Robocop is like ironman with his own strenghts, the movies shows too much vilolence, too much blood and bad languages but good movie!"
3,"entertaining, but no classic","I'm surprised so many people consider the original Robocop a classic sci-fi action film. The movie was really cool when it was first released. I remember watching it a few times back then. Being a kid I was really into this kind of stuff. Now, however, the film looks really cheesy and stuck in the 80's decade. It's so cheesy that my dad and I were sitting there laughing as we watched it, shocked that we used to enjoy it back in the day and how the movie didn't stand the test of time.It's got some nice action scenes, but the entire dated feel and the fact that it feels extremely old and cheesy makes it just an ""alright"" movie."
3,a little short on features,"While not up to the standard of other dvd releases in terms of bonus features(i.e.director commentary)one can realize on other futuristic epics such as Dark City or Blade Runner,this version of Robocop is well worth owning for the unbridled brilliant satire and vision. Enjoy."
4,"Great Movie, Great DVD Transfer...","This is one of the best movies ever made, and DVD just made it whole lot better. The picture and sound is awesome! This is a must buy. The only thing this DVD lacks is the Captions, but don't let that stop you from purchasing it."
5,Robocop-CRiterion Collection,"This is one of the best movies I have seen. Although violent, there is an underlying thread that runs throughout the movie. This movie satires big business, and the excess of the mid-80's. The special effects, and the robots(ED 209 and the RoboCop suit) still are visually appealing in 2000. What makes this addition so great is the running comentary of the writers and director. I have watched this movie many times, but the extras that come with this version made this viewing as enjoyable as the first time!"
3,80s movies in BD,"No wonder it's a fantastic movie as well as a milestone of Sci-fi film. However, you will be inevitably disappointed and suffered if you expect a HD video quality."
2,"Love the movie, hate the picture quality","I'm not going to comment on the movie itself because I'm assuming if you bought the Blu-ray you are already a fan.If I had paid more than $9.99 for this disk I would be upset. The picture quality is no better than my old VHS tape. I have other movies that are just as old or older that have been transferred to Blu-ray with much better success. Buy the Blu-ray version because you like the movie itself, not because you want to see a more eye popping picture."
5,Just superb!,"Absolutely brilliant addition to any collection - I already had the Region 2 version but glad I bought this. Completely uncut, ie. Murphy's death and the editied ""normal version"". Tons of special features on the 2nd disc aswell as really insightful commentries. Cool tin packaging aswell! A must for any serious collector."
4,Robocop (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition),"A few months ago I came across the Robocop trilogy pack at Sam's Club for a discounted price,put it in my shopping cart and was headed to the check out line. At the last minute I decided not to purchase it because I was only a fan of the original Robocop. The saying ""a good thing comes to those who wait"" must be true, because a month later I saw a commercial for the 20th anniversary collector's edition. This was a must own for me. I remember watching this movie at the the theater when I was a teenager and I was blown away.The mix af action,comedy,drama, and over the top violence was a sight to behold. The dvd itself is a great investment. It's loaded with special features:rated and unrated version of the movie,audio commentary by the director,deleted scenes,never before seen featurettes, a limited edition tin case, and most importantly-improved picture and sound quality. This annivesary edition of Robocop is a great edition to your movie library."
2,I wouldn't waste my money....,This is a good movie. But I wouldn't waste my money. MGM has this Unrated version in the ROBOCOP Trilogy that was released in 2004. I advise to pick that up if you can still find it.Robocop Trilogy
2,Not a timeless classic!,"Don't get me wrong.I enjoyed watching Robo-Cop.I've seen it more than once,and if I had nothing better to do on a weekday night with friends,I would probably watch it again. That being said;this is not a timeless classic which deserves to be a Criterion Collection Standard. This movie should only last as long as popular,topical entertainment value films inevitably do. There is nothing ground-breaking here,nothing particularly interesting cinemagraphically,just a C+ to B average piece of entertainment. When held against the stature of Verhoeven's 4th Man,(Robert Englund's favorite horror movie),and Soldier of Orange,this film even takes a HUGE step down from entertaining,to a personal embarrassment for Paul!"
1,Blu-Ray Extras?,I wonder if Amazon is going to post my review.Why doesn't a Blu-Ray have any Special Features? Wtf is wrong with these people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I will Not buy any Blu-Ray or HD DVD that does Not have any extras!!!!!!!!!!
3,decent,good transfer. audio is good but nothing exceptional. bear in mind that this copy is bare bones. no special features. standard dvd comes 2 discs loaded with extras so I dont know whose idiotic idea was it not to include the same stuff on the blu ray release. but still this is the unrated directors cut and a must have.
3,Unimpressive visual quality.,"Unfortunately I have to say that the benefits from High Definition are not to be found in this BluRay edition, video quality is grainy and essentially not worth as an upgrade for the already great Criterion Collection edition."
3,Save Your Money !!,"If you already owns this on standard DVD then do yourself a favor and ""SAVE YOUR MONEY"" because the Blu-ray version is on the grainy side. I also find this to be true for most older movies that have been put on Blu-ray discs. It seems to be that only very recently made movies are worth getting on Blu-ray disc."
2,'Starting to become annoyed...,"Now why on Earth would you buy this edition, if (like me) you were dumb enough to get the Criterion edition + the damn trilogy package? When the hell Hollywood will stop treating us as if we're goddammed piggybank?!Wanna know what I'm waiting for, when it comes to Robocop? I've heard MGM were interested in remaking ""Robocop 2"", but with Frank Miller's uncensored original sceenplay, and as an animated flick! Now why didn't I heard nothing new on that project?! Is it so goddamn hard to greenlight a production that will so obviously be MONEY?!!!Anyway, doesn't look like I'm stupid enough to pay this new edition too... or so I hope."
1,a very gruesome movie!,"when i first saw this movie back in 1994, i did not seem to care about violent content in movies. But that was 6-7 years ago, and I haven't seen the movie since. i just rented the regular movie edition (R-rated not X-rated Director's Cut) on dvd, and I had seen the x-rated director's cut and thought it ruined such a great movie. But then I saw the R-rated version and saw still how much graphic and gruesome violence there was in this movie. I will never look at Robocop the same way. I will never buy this on DVD or VHS again. If u have a weak stomach that gets sick after watching body parts fly in the air and see a man get brutally murdered, then stay away from this gorefest. WORSE THAN THE SCREAM TRILOGY! If you want to see Robocop just rent the 3rd movie which is PG-13 and has less violence in it. Take my word for it."
2,Overrated and nauseating,"Generally, a regimmicking of usually-better vigilante/cop action and sci-fi movies; nihilistic and glib comedy with a tacked-on happy ending claiming satire on capitalism (must film-makers and critics rationalise so?); gaping plot holes; generally unremarkable characters, plot and performances (the friendship between Weller and Allen being a rare exception); partially enlivened by slick direction. The appalling sequence in which a jeering gang trap and nearly-dismember Murphy is as stomach-turning and needlessly explicit as anything I've seen in any movie and several other sequences, such as Verhoeven lingeringly recording a man's melting and annihilation in toxic waste, which would be as offensive if not ludicrous, show, as in most of Verhoeven's Hollywood films, a sadistic and pornographic artistry cynically catering to the box office. Insane that this gets by with an R-rating while less offensive violence or simulated sex gets NC-17."
2,Blu-ray worthless,"The BD was indistinguishable from the standard DVD. If you own a Blu-ray player, just buy the 20th Anniversary Edition, which looks just as good and actually has some features on it. This version has nothing, unless you count the addition of Cantonese subtitles. Pretty sad."
2,Not quite a true release.,"This Blu-ray release of Robocop DOES NOT contain any special features, contrary to what the back cover says. It is only the movie(Uncut Version), a trailer, and subtitles. I had expected at the very least the same special features and documentary that are on my friends DVD release.I do not own the DVD release of Robocop, so I cannot compare the picture and transfer quality of the Blu-ray and DVD. However after reading about the many different DVD releases of Robocop, the special features alone make the Blu-ray release seem to worth about $5."
4,'The resurrection of Robocop',"I bought this DVD at least a year ago from an internet importer. Living in the UK I found that this title along with many of my other choice movies is sadly abscent from UK retailers shelves.I was pleased to see that Robocop had been given the Criterion Collection treatment . The disc itself has a few extras including the obligatory trailers, but where I was disapointed was with the lack of deleted scenes, although it is a bonus to see the film in it's full 'Un- Rated' form with stomach churning heightened violence, the context of which is reassured by the directors commentary (which is probably the best part of this disc). The presentation is good with logical and informative menu screens. My only big complaint with the package is the lack of an anamorphic transfer which leaves the picture looking grainy in places, also the price of the bundle is a little inflated. That said this is becoming something of a collectors item so it is definitely worth getting hold of."
4,Acid humor and non-stop action.,"ROBOCOP is the best science-fiction story of recent times, blending audacious gore with terrific effects for a stunning trip. It is a landmark classic with great acting and memorable villians...not to mention a great SuperHero! Fun and original revenge tale. Rated R for violence and language."
1,Amazon no longer sells the STEELBOOK version?,"One of the major selling points for me in buying this from Amazon was that it was on sale for $8.99 and I believed that Robocop 20th Anniversary was only available in a Steelbook case! The picture on this site shows a case with rounded corners which regular plastic keep cases don't have and several of the reviews on Amazon mentioned it as the following examples show:""Cool tin packaging aswell!""""the box is metal and I loved it""""I saw this steelbook 20th Anniversary Edition""""a limited edition tin case""""ROBOCOP (20TH ANNIVERSARY COLLECTOR'S STEELBOOK EDITON) PUTS THE OTHER EDITIONS TO SHAME""Unfortunately the Robocop (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)DVD I received came in a standard plastic DVD keep case which I didn't even realize was an option as it wasn't mentioned anywhere? This item has only been out a few months so when they say limited edition they mean it!"
4,Eye-Opening Documentary About 1980s Detroit,"The unrated ""extended"" cut of ""Robocop"" resurfaces once again on DVD, this time as part of a two-disc 20th anniversary edition. Word on the street is that this new edition is remastered, but don't expect any miracles: the thing still looks like it was shot in the 1980s. If you don't own the Criterion Collection edition (long out-of-print), then this is the ""Robocop"" to own. The second and third movies aren't getting any special treatment, but if you remember watching them in the 90's you probably don't want to see any special editions of those films anyway. I haven't been to Detroit lately...how is Delta City coming along?!"
4,A Shakespeare western is a good thing,Writing Shakespeare as in Texas before it was a state and the west was really wild.The result is inspired and the acting is first rate.Kids who would never go to King Learmight actually sit through this oneand might even get the point?The staging seems pretty authentic down to the weapons being used.You really feel for the guy who the daughters put his eyeswith a red hot poker.I loved it as I love both westerns and Shakespeare.
5,King of Texas - Excellent movie,Pretty much everyone else has said everything I wanted to say. This is a very well done adaptation of King Lear. I highly recommend watching this movie.
3,A really different experience...,"Have seen the VHS version of this concert. The pieces played have all been infused with a very different tune to it. Since the accompany orchestra plays flute, precussions, drums among other instruments.Sounds good but somehow the end result is very weird, her music ends up being very ""distorted"". If you are a great collector of her music and enjoy them immensely as they originally are in her albums: synthesizers and or piano only without the extra frills, then stay away from this DVD. Otherwise, you can consider this title."
3,Why she have to talk over her music?,It will be an over 4 stars if Suzanne shut up the annoying part with her commentaries in almost all songs.The rest is very good.
3,Title promises too much...,"The author is an expert in failure analysis in the aerospace industry, and seems to have a fairly good background in that field. The great merit of the book is to discuss the fundamentals of failure and related topics form a metallurgist's point of view. However, most of the relevant part of the book is overly concentrated on discussions of case studies of failures in aerospace parts. Other case studies, such as failures in automotive parts, are lacking. Highly recommended if one works in the aerospace industry, but not as useful for professionals of other fields of activity."
5,Blind Guardian - Metal's Greatest Bards,"Blind Guardian is without a doubt one of the greatest power metal bands in existence, and this live cd set is the ultimate proving point.Almost all of Blind Guardian's classics are mixed here (a couple of greats are missing) and trully bring the feel of a Blind Guardian show right in to your house. From the fans chanting ""Guardian, Guardian!!!"", to the flawless performances, Blind Guardian shows all what a true concert is all about. No fancy fireworks, no crazy sideshows, just pure, in your face metal.For all Blind Guardian fans, this cd is a must have. For all metal fans looking for another band to try out (but you're scared of this album's steep price), try out Tales from the Twilight World and Imaginations from the OTher Side. After those two albums, you won't regret coughing up the dough for this one."
5,Great for all doggies,"This is our favorite shampoo. It is tearless. (By the way, why is not ALL dog & cat shampoo tearless?) It has a wonderful scent which lasts for several days."
4,Scrolling along,"Bought to use for Scroll saw prep work. For me this item works great. I have the dremel plunge router attachment, but find it too firm for drilling holes in my scroll saw work that is to wide to use my drill press on. Just line it up where I want my hole and push down with minimal pressure. If you are a scroller this is a nice attachment, also can be set at an angle for drilling for bowls and such. Neat thing is you can get a dremel knock off and keep it for just this attachment."
3,a case of mistaken identity,"Larry Pointer has made a valiant attempt at proving that Spokane, Washington engineer and businessman William T. Phillips was, in fact, Butch Cassidy. Unfortunately for him, this theory has now been disproven by hard evidence (see DIGGING UP BUTCH AND SUNDANCE by Anne Meadows). In any event, he fails to adequately explain how a thrill-seeking, restless outlaw could suddenly settle down to become a respectable and successful engineer, inventor, and businessman. Legends die hard."
4,A Very Interesting Movie.,"A vacationing family crosses paths with a mysterious force (which the viewer never gets to see), that turns visitors passing through a small desert community into hopelessly permanent residents. This made for television movie isn`t bad, but it leaves too much to the viewer`s imagination. The trailer can easily be found by searching in google videos."
2,Scary ? Huh ?,When I watched this movie I really felt like I was watching some friends low budget schoolproject. I could never take the movie seriously enough to enjoy it fully.Rotten ending and did anyone say that this movie was scary ???Won this DvD from some filmcompany and sold it off on Ebay as fast as I could..dont pay money for this people.
1,I should have been paid to watch this! No stars!,"Don't let the big names fool you. This is a dud. The great actors had no direction whatsover. There was lots of innuendo and build-up but no climax! The whole thing smacks of a highschool film art project. The director must have made this with his pocket money. The only good thing about this flick is that it eventually does end and go back to the video store, where it should rot on the shelf. I am more forgiving than the average film viewer, I mean I really want to be entertained. I'm not one of those jaded film snobs. But take my warning: The actors shouldn't have accepted this script (bad script, canned lined, very unbelievable)the characters shouldn't have gone into the ghost town (they were warned too, just like I'm warning you) and you shouldn't buy or rent this video."
2,Ugh!,"Looking back I can't believe I spent all that time watching the movie to see one crappy ending. You will like the movie a lot right until you see the last 10mins that leave you thinking, ""What the hell just happened?"""
2,Letdown after 4 years,"Four years ago I was watching this movie, but had to leave before it was over, so I taped it. Or so I thought. Later when I watched the tape, I found I hadn't taped the end of it -it stopped where the car turned over while they were leaving town. Well, I've waited for 4 years to see the end of it, so today I watched it all the way through. And I don't know much more now than when I missed the end! I agree with previous reviews - bad plot! Or at least not enough info to even be able to speculate what really happened. It had potential, but never lived up to it. sigh...."
5,Genuinely scarey movie,"I didn't like this movie because of what the previous viewer said, I liked this movie because it was a genuinely scarey movie. Yes, it did have some problems in the story line about what a group of people would normally do but other than that, it is a great story. True, it doesn't have all the gore that the other horror films have, but it doesn't need it either. I do recommend this film to anyone that likes the ""Hitchcock"" type of films."
1,What with the ending.,"I actually was getting excited for the ending to see what they actually faced but they never show or tell you what happen. It seems they just didn't know how to end this movie You never know if they got brainwash,body snatched,etc. Instead your wondering what was the point of watching the movie only to know exactly nothing about what was in the town or what happened to the people. Dont know what the writer or director were thinking."
1,2 Thumbs Down!,"What a terrible waste of time! Although the acting was good, the plot was horrible. We're never told who the 'stalkers' are for sure. Mutants from radiation? Mutant offsprings of the mutants from radiation? Who knows? Then, why/how did the family end up happily living in the town? Were the 'stalkers' body snatchers? Don't borrow, don't rent, and for God's sake don't buy! I only gave it one star, because the form won't let me use zero."
3,"This was a good movie, but it ends horribly","This movie is scary mainly because of the music. It is totally weird and creepy, but doesn't end well. I would recommend it though because the movie is pretty good."
2,Did I fall asleep and miss something here?,"The acting was good. The writing started out being good, but then... Hu?I don't seem to recall going out for a beer during the last ten minutes or so. Disappearance has a wonderful build-up, but ultimately went nowhere.What a shame, I really wanted to like it, but it all fell flat."
3,Good movie if you don't count the last 15 mins,"This movie is pretty good up until the last 15 minutes or so of it.I saw this part of this movie in a hotel room about a month ago, but had to leave before it was over. I came on Amazon to buy it, and after reading the reviews, I was reluctant to buy it. But I figured for under $10, it was worth it.**Possible spoilers below**As other reviewers have said, the ending is terrible. It explains nothing about what happened during the movie. If the ending was better, I would probably give this movie a 5 out of 5 star rating."
4,Scary but yet confusing,"I think this movie was really good. But the partthat confuses me is the ending. I loved the wholeidea of the movie. But i agree with other reviewsi read above that it should have been more puttogether. More explained The things that happenare really scary. The plot is a family goes into aghost town. They go in a run down building andwhen they come out to leave, they're car doesntstart. They decide to camp out in the run downbuilding. When the family wakes up their car ismissing. So now they are stranded in the middleof a desert. The nearest gas shop is 35 milesaway. It excites you cause you know the ""thing""is doing this. You can see from his eye pointof view and you can hear his breathing wheneverhe is on the screen. You never see him though. ..."
2,"This movie had me hooked, but then it got bad.","I really thought that the idea of the story was okay, but it made no sense at all. It just kind of ended very suddenly. You never find out what the heck is going on. You never figure out the mystery. It's supposed to be suspense but it makes no sense! I only give it two stars because it's really disappointing that you don't find out what the problem/mystery is, what happens to the characters, and why everybody's all messed up. It's a good idea, but somebody needs to make a new version of it."
3,Astaire and Rogers Classic,"It's an Astaire and Rogers movie, what is there to say? Guy meets girl, they break up, guy gets girl back. Singing and Dancing ensue. Alright, whatever, I'll review it. Swing Time is the 1936 Astaire and Rogers film that pairs the two together for the sixth time, and they dance! Christ, what else can you really say about it? The plot serves only to link the dancing numbers, and I suppose the comedy is funny at times. You either like films about two people dancing or you don't. The musical numbers are well put together and the film is enjoyable to watch. I wish I could say more about it, but it gets very samey. In my mind, it's just a blur of dances and songs. Is it bad? No, not at all. If you enjoy dancing movies, it's great! If they don't, they don't! That's really all I can say about Swing Time."
2,Sound Levels: Big Problem,"Fred & Ginger are swell, and so is this movie, one of their best. I know every line & every note, and I never stop being amused. But my DVDs of both Swing Time and Top Hat have one glaring, inexplicable, inexcusable production flaw: the sound levels are way off. Most of the dialogue is too low; most of the musical numbers blare. Both are out of range. So talk-talk-talk then--Boom!--deafening music. I should have returned both DVDs as defective."
3,Swing Time correction,"It's always enjoyable to read about the Astaire-Rogers movies, and I thank Mr. Moore for his contributions to the old musicals. He made a glaring mistake, however, in his Swing Time review. He says it contains ""Let's Call the Whole Thing Off.'' He refers to it as ""perhaps their greatest comic song.''""Let's Call the Whole Thing Off'' is from ""Shall We Dance.'' The comedy number in ""Swing Time'' is ""A Fine Romance.''Mike Whiteford and Jane Mathews"
4,They sing too!,"The finest of the nine Rodgers-Astair movies made. That makes the popular dance numbers in Swing Time the best ever filmed. The plot as usual, is dross, a waste of time waiting for the next dance number.Ginger Rodgers was also a fine actress as her career A.F. proved. She also had to learn all the dance backwards since Fred always lead.Astair has said that he was indebted to & most admired Bill ""Mr. Bojangles"" Robinson. He honored him with ""Bojangles in Harlem"" done in blackface. Astair's treatment was not at all offensive.A real bonus was the songs written by Jerome Kern. ""The Way You Look"" & ""Let's Call the Whole Thing Off"" showed that Rodgers & Astair were more than just dancers. Indeed Astair was quite a taskmaster, demanding (& getting) perfection. No cutways, no editing of a sequence, the numbers are done straight through & the camera never blinks. They had style they had grace."
1,Defective Copy,"Swingtime is the one Astaire and Rogers musical which did not transferto DVD. The picture ""freezes"" at several points early in the film.I have not had this experience with the other Astaire/Rogers DVDs and Iown all of them. Have any of the other owners of this DVD had this prob-lem?"
1,Sticky!,"I have short, mostly straight, fine texture hair. This product is not what the description says. It's is NOT weightless, and it IS sticky. After styling my hair with a blow dryer, I had to brush it repeatedly at the part to get rid of the hard sticky look. Also, it seemed to give my hair even more static than it had without any product. I'm going back to Paul Mitchell Medium Hold Sculpting Foam."
2,Anti Fade Makes A Difference in Color Retention,"The product is thick and easy to apply to wet or damp hair. I noticed that my color stayed strong through to my next touch up. Unfortunately, I discovered that I am sensitive to an ingredient in this product and developed a skin irritation where my hair touched my face. I really liked this product for its effectiveness, but will not be able to purchase again."
5,Pureology Hair setting Gel,"I have used this product for a number of years, having previously bought it from my hairdresser. I no longer use her, and was having a hard time finding the product, until I went online to Amazon.com. It's an excellent product and I like the idea of being able to purchase more than one bottle at a time."
1,Pitiful,"This is a horrid book that contains NO current information, and is essentially a repetition of trite descriptions of champagne tastes and flavors. The word ""brioche"" is used over and over again. If you want to build expertise in Champagne, invest in one of the books by Tom Stevenson and avoid this."
3,Trueblood has a very elevated opinion of Byron's character.,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but descriptions such as ""sane"" referring to Lord Byron seem a little generous when applied to the Lord Byron written about by so many other respectable authors. The biographical information contained is rather extensive considering the book's size, and all of said information is accurate as far as my studies have shown. Altogether the book is an informative and enjoyable read, but the author's view of Byron seems a little too naive. --C.Dola"
3,Super Reader,"I think everyone is pretty familiar with this story. A Texas Ranger is almost fatally injured, and ends up being befriended by an Indian.Left for dead, he decides being masked would be a good idea to hide this fact, as he becomes a force for good, complete with silver bullets and horse.These are pretty short and light."
2,A Drunkard's Social Protest,"Of all the prolific quantity of social criticism which appeared in the post-Stalin, pre-Glasnost era, this is certainly one of the most over-priced and insignificant entries. The detailed exposition of the ravages of alcohol abuse is disgustingly tedious, and hints of the author's supposed familiarity with the stable of excellent pre-revolution Russian writers is as unconvincing as his apparent attribution of his alcoholic behavior to the social structure. In short, the editorial praise dredged up to sell this thing vastly overstates its merits, despite a few mildly interesting flights of hallucigenic fancy. Since the author died at age 55, he may have accurately portrayed his own struggle with depraved alcoholism."
1,Annoying...,"I bought this because others commented about how easily they could follow Dan. Not true! His lessons were way too fast and on top of that, he has an annoying personality. If you're a true beginner, this cd is NOT for you."
2,Don't believe everything you read,"I too bought this DVD because of the other reviews saying it was slow and easy to follow. That is definitely not true. By 5 minutes into the DVD, Dan has taught you 3 chords and is already teaching you to play 2 songs. Instead of slowing down and breaking things down, he basically says ""Turn off this DVD and go practice. When you're ready turn the DVD back on and continue."" As a beginner, I still have too many questions and have almost given up trying to learn the guitar."
5,Probably the best book for funk drummers and beyond,"If you really wanna funk and improve your coordination of all your limbs on the drumset this is THE BOOK to get to it. It's a killer. Every page is a challange and you really feel how you are growing with every page. And the best thing is, it's fun to play all this stuff that David wrote and it's useable in your everyday drumming. Everything is special and has a magic touch. There is nothing to compare to it on the book market to my knowledge. If you want to make some giant steps forward it's a must!!"
5,Future Sounds (Book & CD) [Paperback] David Garibaldi (Author),"If you like funk drumming - if you like David Garibaldis drumming - this IS the book.David gives so much insight into his approach to funk drumming in this book. Every question I had ever had is answered in it. It is like he is giving away all of his secrets, his complete approach.The book has exercises to work on. He tells of his concepts using ghosted notes and accents. Linear drumming, permutations... it just goes on and on.The best book ever written on funk drumming. One of my favorite books. One of the best out there in any style, it just doesnt get any better. If you like funk drumming and want material to work on that will help - THIS IS THE BOOK"
1,Woah!,"Wait a minute. Here is a CD with a mere 10 songs (remember - a cd can hold 80 minutes worth of music) that carries a full list price? Ca-ching! TO make matters worse, there are three other editions of cds each with a mere 10 songs, and each carrying a full list price. Ca-ching! To top it all of, these songs are incredibly sappy."
4,"DE review of ""Barry Manilow - Greatest Hits, Vol. II","This U.S. version of the original ""Greatest Hits, Vol. II"" from 1983 is a far superior version than the ""Greatest Hits, Vol. 2"" made from Arista Records in the late 1980's. The reason for this being is that the song ""Put A Quarter In The Jukebox"" which is a duet with Ronnie Milsap is nowhere else to be found along with lesser known hits such as ""Your'e Lookin' Hot Tonight"", ""Let's Hang On"", etc. The only thing bad about this compilation is that it omits the top 40 single ""Oh Julie"", which is not available on any of his other releases."
3,Practical information from UK perspective,"This UK DVD is follows three women through their pregnancies - each in a different trimester and also follows one woman through labour and birth. Although most women will be able to relate to these experiences, health care practices and labour laws are different in the UK than in the US and Canada. There are many useful tips like what to bring to the hospital, and suggestions on things to buy for baby. Although, nappies, is a far cuter term than diapers, this and other UK terminology for baby items may confuse some parents.I also found the summary of symptoms at the end of each chapter focused too much on potential negative symptoms and the footage of the birth itself, although very realistic, was not the most re-assuring for women hoping to avoid having an epidural. It would be nice to show examples of natural births without medical pain relief as well."
4,It was a gift,I bought this for my father for his new laptop(He takes it everywhere). He likes the versatility this mouse offers him without having to worry about batteries.
5,Great Mouse!,"I like this mouse, it packs nicely into my laptop backpack. It's a lot more responcive them that silly wireless that cost me twice as much."
2,Portable should be rugged,"Anyone purchasing this product must be intending it for portable use. While the retractable cord seems attractive it worked as supposed for only two days. After that it started retracting itself while working with the device which was very anoying, so i ended up having to eliminate the retractable function to be able to use the mouse. Casing is made of really cheap plastic and after two weeks the little silver accent on top of it lost it's adhesive and fell into the mouse's body, leaving an ugly hole on top. If you are planning to use this to carry around with your notebook look at some other products, since the build quality of this one really prevents me from recommending it. While it worked, it worked fine but not for long."
1,It would be a great mouse if they'd just spend an extra ten cents on the cord,What a shame! Here's a sophisticated little piece of technology that ultimately fails because some pinhead at GE decided to save a few cents by going to the gutter for the cable. I've had two. I thought the first one might have been a fluke but the second failed in the same spot within a few months....
1,"Poor quality, stopped working within 2 months","This mouse is made of poor quality. The retractable mechanism stopped working after about one month. Then after the second month the mouse stopped working all together. I've had another retractable mouse branded by a computer manufacturer that was about the same price and had a very similar design. It lasted a bit longer, but untimately went through the excact same set of issues. Probably the same company tha has them just re-branded by multiple companies."
2,Disappointment with mini-mouse!,"Shipment was quick so no problem there. I was disappointed because I had seen a mini-mouse at Target and expected it to be just that, mini! It wasn't at all and was the same size of what I have. I needed a very small mouse to use in a limited space. Ended up giving it to a friend. Bought a real mini-mouse somewhere else and its what I needed."
1,don't waste your money,"mouse died in less than 8 weeks, sellers only comment is that i should contact manufacturer as they are good at shipping replacements . mouse clearly inferior product and now i have to figure out how to contact GE ... don't waste your money or time"
1,worked great for awhile.,"worked great for awhile then it started working intermittently, bought another one and it didn't work at all. I removed in retractable gadget because it was pointless and annoying so I couldn't return it."
1,easy escape!,"my husband and 9 year-old daughter got this at hobby lobby with a gift card she got for her birthday. well, the ""free"" crab was more of a rip-off, you are required to pay an excess of $10 for shipping and handling. we ended up buying two crabs at petsmart for 5.99 a piece. unfortunatly, one died but we were given a replacement. to make a long story short, the replacement is now named hudini. he was able to get the lid off the cage and escape. luckily, he didn't get far and was able to be found quickly. the entire container (calling a cage is way too generous) is made of out thin, plyable plastic. even the base is flimsy. it is rather pathetic. do not buy. spend the extra and get the good stuff!"
1,not good for a REAL pet,"hi! we bought my 6 yr.old son 2 hermit crabs at the mall, ""they are really easy to take care of!"", said the sales man. they came with a plastic critter cage. the cage similar to the one sold here. I asked the salesman about their care. & he didnt give me enough detailed info. once home, with them, in their ill suited cage, i did research on the web. they do need a glass terrarium with glass lid, perfect humidity,& temp., also a heater, etc. these are not throw away pets.They need to be bathed weekly, fed daily, given salt H20 & drinking H2O. ETC.!!!they are fun, with the proper equipment. my kids DO love them. just get them WHAT THEY NEED. (NOT THIS) poor little guys."
1,"PLEASE! if ur a HUMANE person DON""T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!",THIS....THING is the WORST possible place for a hermit crab to live. here are some bad points :1. it's SUPER FLIMSY2. you have to PAY EXTRA to have hermit crabs SHIPPED to your house(i don't need to waste my time telling you all the bad points about THAT!)3. it's awful! it can't retain humidity (hermit crabs need humidity to BREATHE!) hermit crabs need a LOT more than this dreadful death trap can even BEGIN to offer! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!thank you :)
5,"excellent, perfect little gift for friends","excellent, perfect little gift for friends. Just what I wanted to give to friends for xmas."
1,Nothing to this game,You can make this game yourself by using picture flashcards (the type that teaches alphabets using letters or pictures) or memory cards with different pictures. It wasn't worth $10. Only having 10 pictures makes it too easy for anyone other than very young children.
4,Well-Kept Secret,"Secret Sphere are an Italian power metal band that are very similar to early Labyrinth. The songs are mostly midtempo, well-written and well-performed, and tend to have a somewhat 'romantic' feel to them (warm production, synths for atmosphere, flowing guitat work, etc). If you're expecting something akin to Rhapsody, you're in the wrong place. The songs on this album are consistently good, except for the juvenile and glammish 'virgin street 69', which is really out of place on this album. Only complaint would be that the songs tend to be very similar to one another, so they do run together. Their next album, 'hearts & anger', seemed to fix this problem by offering more varied song structures. Overall, a very good album for fans of melodic power metal like early Labyrinth or Magnitude 9, just don't expect blazing speed and fist-in-the-air headbanging anthems (if you want that, check out bands like Hibria or Dragonforce)"
1,Sex Music,"Some how I got suckered into buying this piece of sh-- album,this is not metal this is sex music.There are only two good power metal bands Labyrinth and old Helloween.This album is pure gay,this crapy band is music that girls would like.This band isn't power metal they are sex pop music.DON'T BUY THIS CRAPY ALBUM OR ANY OF THERE OTHER ALBUMS BECAUSE THERE ALL THE SAME PROBABLY.AWFUL.THIS ALBUM DOES NOT GET A ONE STAR."
2,Mechanical crock!,"This is another churned out horror flick that fails to deliver.After its promising start the movie spirals down into the farcical.It actually brought tears of laughter to my eyes.Wow,just writing this review brings the whole stupidity of it back to me.Save your cash."
4,The closest you can get to being there,"After recently returning from the 2003/2004 falls festival this cd was a great reminder of the brilliance of the music that is played at such a great festival, the only drawback to this cd is the lack of live music recorded at falls. Nevertheless, this is certainly a cd with excellent songs to sing along to or simply have a boogie, highly recommended"
5,Great quality,"This was a gift to my wife, I just want to say that she looks really good in it and there is no much difference from the expensive Columbia's or North face."
2,I don't get it,"I was very excited at the prospect of viewing this movie after seeing/reading all the accolades it had received. But I must say I was greatly disappointed. I felt the acting was average and the writing was trying to keep a heavy topic light; it didn't work. A much better choice would be Pariah which also expresses an aspect of coming out but with much better acting, cast selection and direction. Another excellent choice would be Saving Face. Both are 5 star efforts in my book."
5,Awesome,"This movie was excellent! I was a little scared to purchase at first, but then I said, what the heck I'll purchase it. I am so glad I purchased this DVD it hits on a lot of points lesbians go through. I'd recommend this movie to any lesbian who is ""in the closet""!!"
5,Phenomenal!,"I really enjoyed this film. There are so few films/shows that depict black lesbian relationships and ""Family"" is definitely one of the best of the bunch. I really loved the actresses and actors that were chosen for this film as well as the plot which was easy to follow but still touched on many very important and relatable issues. Much respect to everyone involved. Thank you for your work. :)"
2,Trainwreck,"I can't believe how terrible the acting is in this film. It's truly like watching a trainwreck...or a bad car accident! I rented this movie because I was happy to see there was a Black film about a group of lesbians who have been living in the closet and make a pact to come out together. The review I read said it was like ""The L Word"" and ""Girlfriends"" when in reality it was really nothing like either one of those shows. Again, the acting was so terrible it was hard to get into the movie and have any empathy for any of the cast members. I couldn't connect to any of them. I really wish I could give this film a 4 or 5 star rating, God knows there aren't many movies with the subject matter addressed for Black lesbians, but unfortunately it missed the mark."
1,home made,"It looked like a home made movie, I couldn't watch it for more than 5 min. It was poor quality filming and acting"
3,Good Movie,"The movie is good given the way the contenet is handled. Some insights worth noting are revealed. This is not a must see, but seeing it once will provide a bit of entertainment."
1,Waste of money,"I am a new hamster owner and this cage was my first mistake. I have a Teddy Bear hamster and she is still a baby, just a couple of months old. This cage is way too small for her. The pieces are very brittle and break easily. The ball doesn't turn very smoothly or easily and of course is a little noisy. I wish I could put a regular wheel in here, but can't because of the pyramid shape of the cage. All of the accessory pieces you can buy for this are total junk too. The tubes don't stay together and fall apart once my hamster crawls inside. Not a good buy. I just bought the Jack 72 Hamster Resort and hope it works out better!"
1,Bad product,"I ignored the bad ratings, and figured I could fix anything that was wrong with the design if it didn't work. Wrong. Fell apart and killed wife's girbil on the first day. These things should be recalled. I bought the whole setup and all the acc. They all went into the trash."
4,Great for a gerbil,This house is really good for a gerbil. Ours loves to climb up inside the ball. She doesn't use it like a wheel but has built a nest up there and loves to sleep there. She competely chewed up the steps inside but actually seems to prefer paper towel roll tubes instead anyhow. The ball is a little hard to clean but we just rinse it out and put it in the top rack of the dishwasher. So far it's dishwasher safe. The tubes haven't fallen off and although the cage was difficult to assemble initially it comes apart and goes back together very easily now.
3,Unskippable Introduction Every Time You Play the DVD,"Don't like having to watch the Introduction (5 minutes) every time I play the dvd. I'm usually short on time, so it is really irritating and a waste of time. When I try to go to menu, it won't let me. Other than that, you get a good workout and it is easy to follow."
2,Not for beginners...,"This video is rated as a Beginner/Intermediate cardio workout. It includes an approximate 20 minute ""Beginner"" cardio session and a ""bonus"" second 20 minute cardio session to be done with the first session to really burn the calories.As a beginner, I found the so-called ""beginner"" session to be very hard to keep up with. I have done aerobics before and am not completely out of shape and I could hardly keep up! She literally shows you the move once and then kicks into high gear. It was ridiculously fast without enough explanation of the moves. I was very disappointed.If you're an ""Intermediate"" aerobics person this ones probably ok for you, if you're a beginner, save your money."
1,Only for the VERY coordinated,"This DVD was disappointing and hard to follow. If you're not the most coordinated and have a hard time changing movements suddenly, this one is not for you. This is definitely my least favorite of all my fitness DVDs and my least favorite of Kathy's."
2,Not really for a beginner,"I don't consider myself a beginner in that my fitness level is around the average range, I am a little on the uncoordinated side and I couldn't keep up with this. Kathy doesn't slowly walk you through the steps and neither are they simple steps, so if you are looking for something for that is for uncoordinated people like myself, this would not be the video for you."
4,Good,"I enjoyed reading this book. It's written from the perspective of a Lutheran dispensationalist. Although I'm neither Lutheran, nor a dispensationalist, I still benefited a great deal from reading this work. (I would consider myself a reformed Baptist). Mr. Seiss lectures are God-glorifying and I found them to be very convicting. Many times, as I read, I would find myself in absolute awe of the tremendous majesty of Jesus Christ. I would be brought to repentance and confession as I would see God's attitude towards sin and sinners. The reason I am giving this book 4 stars rather than 5 is because the text had bad printing on many of the pages (e.g., parts of the words would be missing because the ink would be too faint / or the ink was not there at all). This was mostly on the pages on the top-right side of the book. I found this problem on dozens and dozens of pages from the beginning of the book to the end."
4,Tears of Happiness!,"This is a great book, Nani Power's best one yet. If you liked Crawling at Night, you'll love this one!! Buy it now!"
4,Great little vacuum,"After purchasing many vacuums over the years, I have finally found one that does the job with no hassles. My housekeep loves this vacuum for it's size and light weight. I like to use it in between her visits to keep up on the dog hair and dust. I recommend this to anyone that lives in a small place and has no carpets to deal with."
3,It's Just Okay,"I just got this vacuum yesterday. I have used it and it does work ok for picking up light things and dog hair on hardwood floors. It is very lightweight which is nice. However, it is not what I would call a really good vacuum. The attachment for the rugs is useless, it does not work well on rugs. And, the hardwood floor attachment, while it works, runs plastic wheels on your hardwood so I am not real comfortable using it on hardwood for fear of scratching it. So, if you want a vacuum for a decent price for the sole purpose of doing quick cleanups on hardwood floors, and are not too worried about scratching your floor, this is an ok value. Otherwise, I'd pass. I had a cannister vacuum before that broke and it had a fantastic rubber only hardwood floor attachment. But, that vacuum was $350+. So, I guess you get what you pay for."
3,"Not the best, but I'll live with it","I agree with Prof2U about the Hepa filter. It's a real pain to clean, and you really need to clean it about every two times you use the vacuum. I really doubt that the filter is keeping the air clean. I wish the vacuum had a regular disposable bag.I found a website that sells the filter for $24.98, including shipping. I still find that way too expensive, considering the filter will have to be changed every few months. Even after brushing and brushing, the filter still is dirty.I have an Oreck for my carpeted floors, but I bought the canister to clean my wood floors. I wanted something inexpensive, and it does do a good job. Seems to have plenty of power, and it rolls quietly and smoothly behind me as I work. The short cord isn't a problem. I attached a 9-ft extensive cord and leave it on when I store the vacuum.I'd probably give this a 5-star rating if it weren't for the Hepa filter."
4,Great 2nd Vacuum,"I've used this vacuum now for a few months and it is great for hard floors and for getting into small areas, upholstery and where our Kirby won't go. I don't use the cheap plastic attachments. I went to a vacuum store and purchased good horsehair brushes. It is a very well designed vacuum and attractively priced. One thing to watch is that it will clog the filter quickly if you do cleanup of ash residue after cleaning out your fireplace."
1,Don't Buy It !,"I bought this vacum at Target nearly six months ago. It has a very strong suction, and runs relatively quiet, but it cost a fortune to maintain! The root cause for this maintainence is that Dirt Devil designed this machine to use the Hepa filter as a vacum bag. All the dirt raps itself around the filter until its completely crapped up, and if you use it beyond that stage it will completely shut-down. I call customer service about it, and they recommended that I clean the filter more frequently. Which I now do, but I still have to replace the filter on average once every 2 months or else I'm force to breath all the fine particles that the Hepa is suppose to protect me from. The cost of each filter is an appauling $30 bucks. My car filter doesn't cost more than $7 dollars. At this rate I've already bought the vacum cleaner within my six months of use. Save yourself the hassel. Don't buy it!"
1,"Sucks, but not in a good way","My problems with this item are threefold (so far). I just bought it and am trying it out for the first time today and here is what I've noted:1. the rug attachment doesn't do squat and while I have mostly hardwood floors, I do have a couple of area rugs that need to be vacuumed at least occasionally;2. the cord is VERY short. Annoyingly so. With my other vacuum cleaners, I've had to move the plug once while doing the house, but with this one, I'm moving it as much as twice per room. Why on earth didn't they give the thing an ample electrical cord????3. the handle/arm of the thing is way too short. I have to bend over to use it and this is hard on my back (and I teach Yoga!) I'm looking to try and find another segment I can buy to attach to the handle to lengthen it.But, in fact, I'm seriously considering returning this thing to the store from which it came."
3,Works well but terrible smell,"I purchased this Dirt Devil vacuum after extensive research of vacuum reviews on Amazon and other websites. The suction is very good, but the vacuum cleaner emits a smell of heated plastic that is horrible and quite possibly unhealthy. I don't know if our vacuum is defective or if the smell will go away after a while or if this is just normal. I am keeping the vacuum cleaner because it would be a lot of effort to return it, but I only use it for a few minutes at a time, and only in very well ventilated areas."
4,Dirt Devel,"Great product, great value for the price and does exactly as it is presented. Wish it had a longer cord, but overall, good quality product. Does an excellent job on all floorings. I'm glad I bought this item. It's easy to transport up and down stairs as well."
1,Don not purchase this item,"Dirt Devil 082660 Vision Canister VacuumThis vacuum is small and light, however, the suction power is almost nothing, on carpet. On hardwood flooring it is great. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Carpet attachment worthless,"Bought this more for dusting walls, ceilings, furniture and hard to reach places, etc. However, when I used the carpet/floor attachment, it broke the 2nd time. The attachments are of cheaper plastic construction and since I use an upright for my carpets, didn't bother with returning it. This is not the machine you want for your primary machine."
2,Good for the price,"I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a vacuum considering I have all tile floors with only a few area rugs. I also wanted a beater bar in the vacuum head for carpet, this has it. There are pros and cons to this vacuum.pros: great suction, lightweight, has on board tools, retractable cord, no bagsCons: it is hard to maneuver. The hose is cumbersome and makes the head unit difficult to steer. The head unit is NON motorized so it doesn't move freely, you have to really push it. As for the noise level, I would say its average. My dogs don't go running from the room. The cord could be a tad longer.Edited: After using it for several months, I have stopped using it. It got to be too cumbersome to use around the house. Trying to vacuum AND pulling the canister behind you is a pain. I bought an upright and have put this one to use in the garage.I would not recommend this vacuum."
1,Wish I could get my money back,This product was a poor performer. Little suction. Attachments fall off readily. We had to buy another vacuum to replace it. The hose makes a nice toy for a toddler.
2,Disappointed with this Dirt Devil 082660 Vision Canister Vacuum,"Bought this to replace my Dirt Devil Breeze Vision bagless canister vacuum which is about 10 years old and still works but has plastic wands that don't always hold the tools. As well, I seem to be cleaning them out more frequently. But compared to the new vacuum, the handle with wands is longer, the dirt cup large enough to clean the whole house, and the permafilter lasts the life of the vacuum. This is the better product. I don't want to stoop to vacuum or clean the tiny dirt cup after each use on my wool area rugs. And I don't want to buy new filters. The suction seems similar. The ""new and improved"" Dirt Devil is not for me."
4,Great vacuum for the money,"I bought this vacuum to replace an older Dirt Devil canister and I love it. It has great power and is easy to maneuver. I like the bagless idea-although you would want to empty it in an outside trash-it would be pretty messy inside, but the filter and dust bin is easy to remove.The only drawbacks are that the cord could be longer and the tools attach to the wand and if you want to vacuum in a tight area they get knocked off.I love the turbo brush for area rugs and dog beds."
4,Dirt Devil is an angel.,Love the Dirt Devil. Does the best job of any cleaner I ever used. I recommend it over all others. Excellent cleaning ability and excellent value.
2,died after only 3 uses,I got this for christmas via my wish list last year and I only got to use it 3 times before it started sounding like a jet engine. I was 7 months pregnant and working full time and needless to say time passed and I never called to complain. I have a dog that sheds HORRIBLY and so we actually have to use a shop vac to keep up with him. I must say i do LOVE the attachments as they fit perfectly on my 1/4 hose shop vac. :) Maybe it was the amount of dog hair I was sucking up that sent it to the grave I don't know but for $100 I was expecting something a lot nicer.
1,Not worth it,"This is my first review. I felt I had to review it, I brought it about a year ago to replace my mighty mite cannister. Just dont buy it, a broom would do better.very poor suction power,awkard gimmickey handle.I did give it 1 star cause i like the retractable cord.Dont buy it!"
4,Not a bad little vacuum!,"I looked at about 1000 vacuums before deciding on the dirt devil. I am actually quite impressed. We have mostly hardwood with some area rugs. On the hardwood it is the best!!! Picks up pet hair wonderfully (instead of just making it fly around the room like our old upright). It even does a good job on the area rugs (you just have to switch to the turbo head). I love the ease of emptying the canister with the push of just one button. I have the same complaint about the short cord, but I can deal with it since I like in an old house with small rooms! I also love that it is really quiet for a vacuum... no need to shout when it's running."
4,a great vacuum,I've had this vacuum for about two months now and I love it. We have a Golden Retriever and a black cat and they both shed like crazy. Our old vacuum use to just push the hair around but this one actually cleans it up. It's pretty good at picking up dirt and other things too. The attachments really come in handy.
2,Maybe for light duty...,"This canister vac might be ok for VERY light duty, but don't expect it to handle any ""real"" housecleaning. The filter clogs easily and this item is very prone to overheating, which leads to long waiting times because it turns off when it gets too hot.If I had it to do over again, I would not purchase this vac. I would save up and buy a better canister vacuum."
2,don't bother,"Decent on bare floors, and worthless on carpet. Tools fall off the holder. Doesn't store very well. Design-wise, the bin to empty the dirt does minimize contact with the dirt."
2,Regret buying,"I've got hardwood floors and rugs, and this vacuum really doesn't get the job done on either. The rug attachment is very difficult to maneuver and takes several passes to get up all the small bits of lint, very little suction. I might as well just use a lintbrush. The floor attachment is cheap and made of hard plastic that I'm afraid will scrape up my floor, my cheapo swiffervac does a better job (and is scratchless). If my house had all tile or vinyl floors I'd be happy with this vac, as it is light enough to schlep. The upholstery attachment is decent, as is the crevice tool. On the whole, every other vacuum I've owned has been both cheaper and better."
4,A warm spot,"Widely lauded as Manilow's return to form, this CD falls short of its goal, but still contains some memorable tunes that slide down like warm milk.I'll admit, though, that I have a warm and fuzzy spot for this album: ""Keep Each Other Warm"" is the song my spouse and I danced to at our wedding as our first husband/wife song. It remains a personal fave, and I still get teary every time I hear it.So thanks, Barry, for a great tune. Now, when are you going to record another ""Paradise Cafe""?"
3,Kinda Sorta,This one sounded like he was riding with a band of gypsies. It is definately missing something.
1,Same ol' Barry,"I've grown so tired of all the hype surrounding Mr. Manilow. I mean, he's no Tom Jones. Sure, he's written a few good numbers but the bottom line is, he has not withstood the test of time as gracefully as Tom. I don't mean to start a rivalry but this myopic love affair with Barry must cease!"
5,A Great Pop cd,"Barry's wonderful voice delivers on this great set of pop ballads and mid-tempo songs. ""You Begin Again"" is beautiful, and 'The One That Got Away' has a Phil Spector sound to it, 'Please Don't Be Scared' one of Barry's most intimate vocals, 'Some Good Things Never Lasts'(also recorded by Barbra Streisand)is a song that really touched me, 'A Little Travelling Music, Please' has a great arrangement, one of the best songs Barry has ever recorded!, this is another great cd in the Barry Manilow catalog!"
4,My review for Eclipse by Cate Tiernan,"Eclipse is an intriguing novel in the Sweep series. Once again, Morgan finds her life to be in danger from magickal means. The love, betrayal, self-discovery, power, and danger that fills the pages of this novel are cleverly written as they are enchanting. This novel brings new twists and turns into the series, still able to hold the attention after eleven previous novels."
5,Going to the top of my fave of the series...,Like many people numbers 10 and 11 weren't my favorite. i was getting a little disaponted too.then i read this book and Cate had brought back the action. i really loved this book and i recomemend this series for anyone even people who don't like or do Wicca. I enjoyed this book and you start to like Alisa and understand what she's going through (Alisa and Morgan share this book.) Read this book....
5,A very great book!,"This book really helps people undersyand as to why there were accidents in Strife. It is told from Morgan and Alisa's perspective. This book is the third to last of the series though. Book 14, Full Circle is the last one to be written and things may change for people's relationship's. The next book,Reckoning, will be entirely told by Alisa when she tries to find her mother's family and the final one, Full Circle will be Hunter and Morgan's relationship and Hunter might not be a Seeker anymore."
5,The origin of all modern revolutions,"If you want to understand what really happened in the past 200 or so years, this is the book for you to start that journey."
2,Over-rated as intellectual history - contains stark omissions,"Mr. Billington omits all mention of the intellectual impact of Algernon Sydney on the Founders. Sydney, who was executed by King Charles II of England, in his debates with Robert Filmer, an advocate of the divine right of kings, transmitted to the Founding Fathers crucial theories of republican government originated by Catholic Cardinal Robert Bellarmine. Billington will have none of it.Billington also obscures Thomas Jefferson's principled opposition to the Babylonian Talmud and Orthodox Judaism.These are significant gaps which substantially undercut any claim to this book being a comprehensive intellectual history of the American Revolution."
5,The Complete Sherlocj Holmes Collection,I bought this collection for my husband (who is a Sherlock Holmes fan) and he loved them! He spent days watching episode after episode.
5,Sean is to Bond what Basil is to Holmes....,"Basil Rathbone is Sherlock Holmes like Sean Connery is James Bond. Period. Five discs of vintage classics. Elementary, Watson!"
2,not completely satisfied,"We were not able to play 2 of the discs on our DVD player. We were sent a replacement and the same two discs did not work either. I am waiting for a return label to return both sets and am hoping for a full refund of the product. We were very dissapointed and hope the problem is fixed. Amazon actually gave us a $10.00 credit for this problem, Sarita McNally"
5,Elementary,I remember watching this series as a child with my father. I remember that I used to be glued to the tv and when the series ended I cried a bit. To find it all these years later on BLUE RAY.... This is the best Sherlock Holmes series ever made.
1,"Fun films, but TERRIBLE package...","I always thought these DVDs were greatly overpriced, no matter what the format, but when I found the set for $79.99 at a warehouse retailer, I finally succumbed. Even at that price, these are STILL overpriced. The box is rubbish, the plastic cases secured by one thin piece of tape that disengaged as soon as I opened the box. No booklet of chapters, nothing except a self-congratulatory essay about the restoration. And HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES does indeed freeze up at about 1:08 on one machine, and freezes but then keeps playing on another. Unforgivable. Extremely shabby treatment of classic films. One star is pretty rough, but I'm sick to death of nickel-plated packages being priced like gold. When Warner puts out box after box of brilliantly reissued and well packaged classic films at less than half the cost of this on-the-cheap package, it's time to complain, and loudly. Note: I'm not criticising the films; I'm criticising the packaging and the price."
5,Enjoying these classics with my grandson!,"It is so good to see these great movies restored and clean. Packaging is also very nice. Of course for the most part the movies bear very little resemblance to the original Doyle stories but most viewers will be able to look past this just to see Holmes come to life in the person of Basil Rathbone. Even Nigel Bruce's Watson eventually grows on you. Dialogue is clever, and when you combine the black and white medium with imaginative use of lighting and shadows the result is creepy villains and sinister settings. Really the only negative is the subtitling which must have been done by someone either not familiar with the Holmes stories or the English language or both. I have been watching these with my grandson--the fourth generation of our family to enjoy these classics. I'm so glad to introduce him to Holmes and Watson via Rathbone and Bruce rather than the horrid new movies and even more horrid tv show. Highly recommend."
1,What happened?,"This blu-ray set quality was terrible, (at least in my edition). The quality showed lines, distortions in the background, not better details. This was true all the way through. The DVD set, also restored, not blu-ray, is a better quality. Anyone else?"
3,Happy so far.,"I remember watching these movies on the late show on our local UHF channel and haven't seen them in many years. I was pleased to see that they were as good as I remembered. I've only watched three so far (Baskervilles, Voice of Terror, and Adventures) and haven't had any problems technically. I feel the package was a little pricey for what was provided. I don't crave extras as I don't want to devote the time to watch four hours of ""the making of"" but in this case I would have enjoyed liner notes or a printed booklet with background information on the films."
4,Incredible set -- less one!,"This is the set any classic Holmes devotee will love - except for one film. It is not explained why (and I haven't read the other reviewers) but two of the films: Hound of the Baskervilles and the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes were not restored by the UCLA film folks. Maybe something to do with the only two done by Fox but not sure. In any event, the copy of the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a terrible print. The last third of the film is so dark it is impossible to see what is going on. Doubt it is a dvd problem since the other two films on the dvd are fine. Saw a better print of it on Netflix a couple of months ago. Other than that, the Universal films are excellent and a joy to watch."
5,Completely Satisfied,I purchased this product from Amazon strictly because of the price. I find the product manufactured well and visually free of major defects.
5,Sherlock Holmes Collection,Movies are wonderfully restored and offered with sub-titles and commentaries. Great for Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce Sherlock fans.
1,Poor Quality at a High Price,"I don't own this set only because of the apparent poor quality. Holmes fans shouldn't have to settle for a second rate reproduction. Too bad, I was looking forward to purchasing the set but I didn't because of the owner's bad reviews."
1,Sherlock Holmes Collection,We had contacted amazon as we never received the product!!!We are waiting to hear back from AmazonVery disappointing
1,no more black & white,amazon reviewers states that the sherlock holmes collection is in color--not! when you open them a few are in color but most are black & white we have color t.v. and we want 2 see these fine movies in color--------please and thank you! v.t.
5,Sherlock Holmes DVD's,These quite rare and old black and white movies are unbelieveably clear! Someone took a lot of time in restoring these to original clarity and sound. Great buyer!
3,"5 stars for the movies, 1 star for the packaging","The movies are great and I'm sure that anyone who has seen Basil Rathbone as Holmes and loves the movies will enjoy this collection.But as others have said the packaging for this collection is terrible. There are no synopses for any of the movies, list of actors, nor is the running time for each movie listed. The total time for each disc is listed on the disc but that's not much of a help unless you're going to watch the entire disc in one sitting.I'm sure that those who love Sherlock Holmes and especially Basil Rathbone will purchase this but it's a shame that it wasn't packaged better."
4,Very good collection!,Excellent collection of the true Sherlock Holmes. Would have been nice if the first two Fox films were redone for Blu-Ray.
4,Nice Collection,I bought this collectionas a gift for my dad. He's really into these old movies. My rating is based on how much he enjoyed watching these.
5,Just what I was looking for,Just what I was looking for. enjoyed this series. and will enjoy watching it over the coming years.keep them coming
4,classic,"a timeless classic, remastered to high standards. very well presented. Rathbone is the quintessential Holmes and Bruce provides a stylized character infused with humor and loyalty."
3,None are the same,"Demons of Eden is Deathlands at its best. A breath of fresh air, or not so fresh as Ryan Cawdor and friends enter the land the ""white coats"" forgot. Mystic and Indian religion are introduced in detail. Just as all the answers of the universe are about to be answered... Don't miss this book.Don't miss the next book in the Deathlands Saga The Mars Arena.Don't miss James Axler's new series Outlanders."
2,WOW TO STEEP,I could use another set of these however for more than $60.00 they can have them !!There is hardly nothing in the making of these.All other high end saw stands have these at half the price.Its dissapointing to see from a good manufacturer.
5,great old movie,"love to watch jerry reed bo hopkins , this was a good old movie not like today s digetal blow up fake things . only can happen in the movies type thing. if you like older movies its a great movie ."
4,Buy it! You'll like it,Keeps you moving. Pace is intense for a while then slows a bit so you don't get overwhelmed and quit. I've been using for 3 weeks (alternating with other Tae Bo videos) and love it!
2,Lots of waiting. Lost interest,"After buying Billy BLanks - This is TAE BO, I was really excited to try another video. The Billy BLanks Tae Bo Classic is a lot of waiting, walking between sets and I lost interest. I love working out, I love being challenged and this one will do that if you have the time and patience. I feel like I could have saved 30 mins if they cut out all the walking and TALKING about the 'classic' moves he's about to perform. I feel pretty disappointed after completing the video."
2,The hour long workout is easy to follow. What I didn't like was that after each sequence you take an extended walking,"break before moving on to the next thing. I loved the original taebo vhs, I used to do it 3 times week and worked hard every time. While this dvd got me sweating, each time my heart rate would pick up another walking break would take it back down. Now when I do the video I do jumping jacks in between or just keep doing the sequence while Billy talks through the walk break."
4,Good V,Great workout. Not for beginners. Find a beginner DVD so that you can keep up. Otherwise i found it really makes you sweat!
3,Too fast!,"I've done P90X, Supreme 90 Day, and Les Mill's Combat but I could not move fast enough to keep up. The pace was too fast to keep my balance and perfom the steps. I really like the work out but if it were slower it would be great."
2,Billy Can Do Better,"I love Billy Blanks and I do know that some of his tapes are little off. This one he is making up moves some of which he calls classic taebo( this tape is no where near the intensity of the original taebo). The group of people working out with him are boring, lack energy, and even my favorite Shelly not only looks a mess (hair). Her energy level is not as high as it usually is. It's like he didn't want to pay the right people for the video. If you are a taebo beginniner then you may enjoy the tape. I said maybe. Otherwise this is one of my least favorite. To see my least favorite check out my review for Taebo express (ridiculously bad). I bought two tapes thinking I was getting something. Boy was I dissapointed."
3,Pretty fast paced for beginners,"Haven't worked out for a while so the pace in this video is pretty fast! Also, don't like some of the people working out in the video itself...lots of screaming going on."
5,"Has a good beat, liked the lyrics, and could dance to it, Dick.","Recently read a lengthy analysis of the lyrics, for the first time. Some mysteries were cleared up, and some alternative explanations explored. Never owned it, so now I do."
5,Great old songs.,"I only like a few of the songs in here, I like having the cd as opposed to just downloading the one or two songs from some web service."
1,welders pocket manual,not at all what I expected from a pocket guide. No useful info just a primer on how to weld.
4,Roots: The Gift,"It is a great story. I think it should have been written into the original ROOTS, not shown as a seperate movie. Louis Gossett,Jr., and Levar Burton were terrific just as they were in the original ROOTS. We only see about five minutes of Michael Learned, which is a shame because she is such a good actress, I think they could have expanded her role. Shaun Cassidy was alright...I never thought he could act. It is a very moving story; brought me to tears when seeing how awful the slaves were treated."
4,Excellent film!,"I am a huge fan of Roots Vol 1-6 that was introduced to me during a High School history class in 1995. Supringly it was not until Christmas 2002 that I discovered RTG. The story of RTG takes places sometime in between Vol II and III. Levar Burton returns as Kunta, and Louis Gossett Jr. returns as the Fidler. I do not wish to give the entire plot away, but will say that Kunta gets another shot as escape (as well as Fidler) but turns down the opportunity. The plot and story on this one was not quite as good as the others, but the director seems to be of the same quality, and the music score is also the same. The feel of the film is like the others. However outside of Levar and Louis all the actors are different. One of the actors laters goes on to play in the X-files.However I will say that this movie tires allot faster than the other Roots. My other gripe is the lack of this movie on DVD. It should have beeen released on DVD by this time."
2,HUGE Disapointment,"I am a fan of roots but this film is utter rubbish! It is obvious that this film was filmed long after the original series as quite a few of the characters are played by different actors! The story is Ok but was made in to a soppy ""christmas special"". I nearly fell asleep! Its a shame because it would have come across better if they had used the story in the original series."
4,Roots Christmas Story,"I didn't like this movie that much because of the usual slavery stuff..It is really well written and well acted out...Kunta Kente and Fiddler are together again and Fiddler is talkin bout running..But Kunta tries to convince him not too...But there are a lot of slaves that need their help so they help them get free, but what about themselves?"
3,"lots of features but only so-so performance, quality","I bought this camera for it's small size, high resolution and many manual options. In well-lighted situations at less than full zoom the pictures were great. In low light, or at full zoom, the camera often had trouble focusing properly and also exhibited a fair amount of lens-shake. This is to be expected in a zoom camera this small, but not to the extent I experienced (in my opinion). Finally I returned it after the auto lens cover stopped functioning (stuck at halfway --(I've heard this has happened to others as well) after 2 weeks of normal use. Packing so many features into such a small package seems to be an exercise in compromise -- I'm going to go with a smaller point and shoot for spontaneous shots (perhaps the pentax s51 or a small casio or pannasonic) and the Panasonic fz20 for my primary long-range shooter."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I like the new single ""Shine"", which has the backdrop of Chic's song, ""My Forbidden Lover"". I was looking forward though to some unreleased gems (which I understand thru a source in the music industry, Luther has plenty of unreleased material, particularly from the Epic days). I hope J records releases them and not deprive the public of this great singer and his body of work. I already have EVERYTHING Luther has made,so personally I don't need another cd with previously released songs."
5,Fabulous music,"I love Luther!! So sad he is gone, however, his music lives on and this is a fantastic collection."
4,"Good collection, but could have been even better :-l","Luther Vandross still remains an all time favourite of mine. There never will be a singer like him. His voice was so unbelievalbe recognisable because of the smoothness and silky sound. He also had some fantastic songs under his belt. Fortunately for me, the majority of my favourites of his are on this cd. Power Of Love/Love Power is his best best best. I love that song. Your Secret Love, Endless Love, Dance With My Father, Here And Now, 'Till My Baby Comes Home and Never Too Much are all brilliant, but there is so much of his career omitted on this cd (I Know, She Loves Me Back among some of the many).Having said that, if you are a fan of his, you might be disappointed with the selection but still impressed that so many wonderful songs are all on the one cd. If you weren't a fan of his before listening to this collection, you may well be after hearing this. It's an amazing cd with some really good songs."
5,Keeps running,I have gone two months without wearing my watch and the kinetic enery that is stored keeps it operation through that time.I love this watch.
4,Penny Whistle,"I was inspired to get a penny whistle when I heard one being played at an Irish music concert. It looked like it was being played like a clarinet.I had in hand within a week of ordering. I also ordered an instructional book with it.Here is one downside...Violet, my cat, hates it!!"
3,It doesn't have a digital tuner!,"I was looking for a digital radio, so it would be easy to get the stations I wanted, but the only digital displays on this clock radio are the time and temperature. And the tuner is so tiny It's impossible to tune in my favorite stations. Now I basically use it as a clock and thermometer. It is nice to be able to see exactly what the outdoor temperature is... but I still need to find a radio!"
2,Not As Good As Expected,"I mainly bought this particular clock for the projection temperature display. The description says the sensor can be 100' away, but the directions state 50' to 60'. The most disappointing thing, which may not be stated for obvious reasons, is that the temperature range is -4 to 140 degrees Farenheit. I live in Minnesota and the -4 is not low enough when the temp. can be -30 in the winter where I live to lows of -45 in northern Minnesota. A better range would be -24 to 120.Other than that, the clock and features work well."
3,Just OK.,"I've had this product for over a year now. Projection feature is wonderful. It is not very intuitive when setting the time zone, etc. and when the power goes out, it defaults back to central time (I am pacific time) so I have to manually adjust it after it receives a synchronization from the atomic clock. There is nowhere to set the default time zone. I used the battery backup, but it didn't last very long so I quit buying batteries. Probably would not buy this particular product again, but the idea is good and it does work on other products in this industry."
3,Coby CR-A149,This product works pretty well. The outdoor thermometer works well and appears to have a decent range. The only drawback to the clock is that there is no way to turn off the backlite display and it is a little bit bright when trying to sleep.
4,Worth your time,Good musicsit back and enjoytake a trip --or-- be whereyou are. It will be therewith you whatever you choose.
5,Midnite Funk,"Knowing the line-up of Bob Weir's solo project, I anticipated the funk and jam style of this album, but was not fully prepared for how good they were. ""Haze"" starts things off with a bang and it just doesn't stop. Dead fans will love this as well as fans of reggae (to wit the cover of ""Book of Rules""), jazz and classic dance music (in the vein of George Clinton). Truly an album for everyone, although those who prefer today's Mega-bass, ultra-thump music that forces the beat down your throat without the subtleties and nuance of pure music may find it ""out-of-date"". More's the pity."
3,"Cute necklace, weak chain",I bought this for my mother as she is a CASA. She said it was very beautiful but that the chain is very thin and will probably break. She is searching for a new chain to wear with it.
5,Welcome the new Jerusalem,"Fantastic album full of great music. My question is - did she read ""The Keys of Enoch"" before she wrote this music?"
3,RIGHT OFF THE MOVIE...,"Soundtracks of yesteryears... This one has some great melodies but they were simply ""cut-and-pasted"" from the movie right unto the CD. Some very nice tunes didn't end very well 'coz, you guessed it, they were meant for the scenes. Would've preferred the score to have its own re-recording."
3,For Hardcore Fans Only,"I like Meaker's spare style and terse chapters which remind me of a Highsmith novel or most fifties novels in general. It didn't have as much detail about Highsmith as I'd like and I don't really see anyone who's not familiar with Highsmith or Meaker taking interest in the story.To be honest even though I bought this book I'd only reccommend it to Marijane Meaker fans. As for the strictly Highsmith fans you'd be much better off with one of her novels or Andrew Wilson's excellent biography ""Beautiful Shadow: A Life Of Patricia Highsmith"" which reads as addictively as one of her own novels."
5,Like A Highsmith Novel,"Fans of Patricia Highsmith - and anyone who reads her becomes one - will want to read this small memoir of a 1959-61 romance with the author, a well-published novelist herself with a style not unlike that of her former flame. The writing evokes the closeted world of the '50s and early '60s when lesbians had to hide, even in NYC. Highsmith doesn't come off too well, though. A virulent anti-Semite, according to the author, the psychological novelist was a lush who liked to drink for breakfast, chainsmoke her way through the day and generally avoid fans and almost anyone else. You don't quite come away with a good sense of how Highsmith produced her art, despite these quirks. But that's not the point. This is a love story, albeit one inevitably gone awry. You'll want to pick up an unread Patricia Highsmith novel when you're done."
3,better not mind getting the wrong color,"I ordered this light in white. It arrived in RED. I read a review of this same light in red and another reviewer said he received it in white.As for quality, it seems okay. I'm going to use it for running or on my messenger bag. The elastic cord means it's easy to mount on many things and the cord is adjustable for different lengths.Added: It just stopped working after a while. New batteries didn't help."
2,Terrible Design,"I've been using Cateye lights for a long time and like most of their models, but definitely skip this one. The design is flawed in almost every way. First it's hard to attach to anything other than a seatpost. The attachment is elastic bungee and as the elastic wears out, the grip on whatever you have it on will slip. If you hit a big bump while riding it may fall off altogether. Also it turns on and off by tapping the plastic fob against the red body. If you are riding and the fob accidentally bounces and taps the light, it can turn your light off. This has happened to me several times. The light only lights on one side, so if you tie it on a backpack or a bag it may flip to the non lighted side while riding or walking. There is really nothing good about this design, every part of it is wrong. It should have never made it out of the prototyping."
1,misleading ..,"i feel cheated, picture shows a pair of light (white + red), however, i only received 1 pc"
4,Quite informative,"Japan at War: An Oral History, is a unque look at the fifteen year conflict through the eyes of the Japanese themselves. I would have given it all five stars had it contained more interviews from people that weren't so apologetic and tried to stay away from the question of blame a bit more. Unfortunately, the book does as many texts and covers up the fact that many, if not the majority of Japanese favored the war and were not following like blind sheep. While the social conditions and ideology of wartime Japan are a difficult topic to incorporate into a work such as this, it would have given the Cooks' work the necessary depth to take the book to a higher level."
5,True Voices,"Pacific War experiences related by those who lived it on the Japanese side. Excellent and moving accounts of what the disastrous war was like ""on the other side."" Helps us see that all people are human beings, not the caricatures and stereotypes portrayed in propaganda of either side."
5,Loved it!,"I read this book when I was a freshman in highschool. I looked at the title, read the back, and instantly felt a connection. It made me feel so good, and when I finished it, I had the biggest smile on my face. It made me feel like no book has before. Thank you for the strength you helped me find."
1,"Try Again, Shannon...","I bought this book mainly because it promised the insight and pain of a teenage girl. The bookstore realated the book to Go Ask Alice, and with that promise, i felt extremely compelled to read it. Words cannot describe how disappointed i was. The main character/author was horribly indesciptive. You never heard when the book took place, and none of the stories even related to each other. It was just a corny, unconnected story about an overly dramatic teenager whose life experiences don't even seem realistic.So for all those girls who thought this book was fabulous, rent a brain and find your own real-life experiences!!!"
3,It was okay....,It was a good book for girls to read because it basically tells you to stay away from alcohol and drugs. But I didn't get too into it...it was very fast-paced.
5,An excellent resource!,"I've lived in the Tampa area for a year now, and I was under the impression that besides Busch Gardens, there wasn't much to do. Boy was I wrong! This book not only gives great attractions to see in the area, including Pasco & other counties, but it also details things like great restaurants and stores that have been here forever. (Try Pete's Famous Smoked Fish in Clearwater, if you like smoked fish. The mackeral is to die for!) If you just want to get out of the house one weekend, this is the book for you!"
2,"Interesting, but misses a key point","This documentary is more about the director and her feelings about Carmen Miranda than Carmen. In the end, I find she does no more service to her than Hollywood did. What she fails to note is Miranda was just great and joyous in those old Fox films. How many other foreign actresses could do a full-length number like Cae Cae with her Banda de Lua? It's authentic and fun and clearly Miranda is enjoying herself.The old clips are fun but I wanted to know more about Carmen Miranda and less about the director. If there were more things available about Carmen, this would be a fine experiment."
4,"MacDonald's ""Brahms"" is informative yet analitically lacking","MacDonald's biography of Brahms is insightful and informative benefiting from findings in recent Brahms scholarship as well as from the authors command of language and knowledge of the art of music. Its only fault, albeit a rather prominent one, is the author's need to comment at least a few words on every work of Brahms's. This becomes tedious and the reader is left with a feeling of unsatisfied curiosity as if he or she is reading program notes to a concert he will not hear. MacDonald, however, reserves his more detailed accounts for Brahms's more important and popular major works (his all too brief analysis of the Fourth Symphony leaves one wishing he would write a book entirely devoted to that masterpiece) a trait which reveals the author's keen analytical mind. The book would have benefited greatly if the author had devoted space given to smaller or less significant pieces to a more extensive discussion of the composers major works"
1,NOT FISKARS BRAND!,"The sewing kit I received looks exactly like the one in the picture, but it is NOT Fiskars brand, which is why I bought it in the first place. I saw it and thought that Fiskars would make a good travel sewing kit. This is a cheap, made in Taiwan sewing kit by some company called Dura Sharp. The scissors (what Fiskars are world-famous for) will not even cut thread! This is a really cheap kit that belongs in a 99 store. I would NOT recommend this to anyone!"
4,It is what it is.,"Cheap plastic? Check. Mediocre tools? Check. Under five bucks? Check.I would certainly not recommend this as a main sewing kit, but as a travel kit, emergency supply, or even college dorm kit, it's just fine. It has multiple needles, colors of thread, scissors (that, let's face it, couldn't cut butter), a needle-threader, extra buttons and snaps, and a few other supplies. It may be super-cheap, but it gets the job done well enough. Just don't rely on it too heavily, because a masterpiece of engineering and manufacturing it is not."
5,Excellent Grab Bar,This is a very high quality grab bar that is fairly easy to install. Use a stud finder to locate wood for the screws and you're set to install. I bought extra hard and slightly longer screws at Ace to make installation very secure. My dad uses this bar in the bathroom all the time now. It's very well made with plenty of grab clearance. It was very well priced too.
2,The History of a Great Man and an Era,"Mr. Barness' book is an amazing biography of his remarkable experiences which overlays a history of Israel and the Jewish people as a whole. His personal ability to persevere subtly parallels Israel's -- hence the subtitle ""The Extraordinary Life of an Ordinary Man."" He teaches the reader the important difference between admiration and jealousy. The book leaves the reader enthused and encouraged. It should be compulsary reading for all high school students. Richard Rene Silvin"
4,Works well with DishNetwork,Bought these to plug in my DishNetwork receiver box. Works very well. Have had it for more than a year now and not once have I had any issues.There was no phone jack close to my receiver box and hence used this device.
3,Be Careful of Extra Phone Jacks,This Southwestern Bell S60900 is really a Philips PH0900 and the unit works fine.....BUT be warned that the S60901 extra wireless jack may not be compatible. Make sure the Philips numbers correspond.... as the SouthwesternBell numbers mean nothing when it comes to compatibility.
1,A real diappointment,"I live in an area where dial-up is the only available internet access that is affordable, so I had hoped the phone jack would make it possible for me to access the internet in any room of my house. That was not the case, however. After I installed it, my dial-up speed went from about 36kps to less than 9kps, which was not useable. I promptly removed the jack and returned to using the internet in one room. Very disappointing."
2,"Works perfectly, even with DSL.","I installed this for use over a DSL enabled line. My 1st review gave this system only 2 stars since I got bad static, no caller ID, and only one ring on incoming calls. I have since learned that the culprit was a ComShare 750 phone/fax/modem switch incompatibility. Once that was eliminated, the jack system worked perfectly on both incoming and outgoing calls on my DSL enabled line. Sorry Southwestern for the earlier angst. This is a great system, certainly deserving of 5 stars."
4,Works well with computer modems,"I bought this to use a computer in a room without a phone jack, and I was pleasantly surprised at the speeds it achieves on a dial-up connection (I was nervous about it, having read that these devices are not practical for dial-up modem use).I routinely get 37333 bps with the Southwestern Bell - that may seem slow, but I rarely get over 44000 with a computer with a direct phone jack connection.Interestingly, the base unit is labeled ""Phonex Broadband"" on the back (made by the same manufacturer?). I also recently bought the Phonex model, and it works fine too, but the SW Bell works slightly better, and it's cheaper than the Phonex as of this writing."
4,Beware if you have DSL,"Nice product, but it did not work with my DSL line and a DSL gateway. Works great for dial up and phones, though."
1,"doesn't work, don't bother","The buzzing noise on this was so bad that I wouldn't even use it for voice conversation, let alone data or fax. Sure enough, it didn't work for fax, just failed to sync up with the remote fax machine. Absolute garbage, and for the price it really ought to be as good as the best wireless phones. (I don't have DSL, my phone line is very clear, I use 5.8GHz wireless phones without any problems. So nothing to do with my environment.)From other reviews, some found it satisfactory. So at the very best it's unreliable. But I wouldn't bother with it."
2,Works pretty well...except with DISH,"Bought the device to add the necessary phone line for my satellite receiver in a room with no hard-wired phone jack. The devices work great, even with our SBC DSL, EXCEPT when the remote unit is connected to the DISH receiver. Even then, it makes good connection with the receiver, allowing it to dial out, etc. And, it delivers caller ID information to the receiver. BUT, when connected to the satellite receiver, the base unit cuts off all incoming calls after two rings, not giving us or our answering machine time to pick up. It's as if it answers the phone and then hangs up. Could not figure out how to stop this. So my score is low if needed for a DISH network 522 receiver."
2,Not for Dish Network,"Used this line for a Dish Network DVR522 receiver and it works, except that after 2 or 3 rings, it disconnects, so my answering machine could never pick up. We have SBC DSL with filters on the line, so maybe it just isn't compatible through DSL, eventhough others have written comments and had no problems. Hooked up a regular phone line to my receiver and no problems. I never tried it using regular phone."
2,"Blue, not classic","Good Songs, Good Background music but little emotion in main singer. This is not one of JH's better performances. Seems to lack emotion."
2,Classic Blue Cheese,"This album is downright silly. I love the Moody Blues, too, but they are much better off sticking to their own material. Justin's voice is in grand form and the orchestration is top notch, but ""MacArthur Park"" and ""Stairway to Heaven""? Come now. It is fun and goofy, and if you are a Moody fan you should probably own it, but I sort of worry about anyone who plays it frequently and calls it ""art."""
1,Are you Kidding?,"I love Justin Hayward's voice, and could listen to him sing about anything. But this cd was a total disappointment. I should have known better than to buy a cd with Justin singing MacArthur Park. I've always hated that song. To me, this cd was just a way to make some money for Justin and really didn't do justice to his voice or his talent as a songwriter."
1,wife of a MB fan,"I didn't buy the cd, but thanks for all the reviews. I enjoy the Moody Blues, and Justin, but there is no way I would ever voluntarily buy an album with MacArthur Park on it. In my dreams of hell, that is the muzak in the elevator stuck between floors!"
3,CD Justin Hayward Classic Blue,"Wasn't one of my favorites from Justin Hayward. I love his voice, but song selection wasn't always his style. I will still buy his cd's, tho."
5,I never seem to get tired of it.,"I live in the US. I had a friend tell me about this album that I didn't know existed. It's not usually found in most stores here. I don't know why. Finally I was able to locate it online and purchased it through CD Now.I got it over a month ago, and have had it in my truck's CD player ever since. My favorite song has become ""Bright Eyes""....with ""Railway Hotel"" a near second.If you like the Moody Blues, this is the same lead singer but other than his voice, the musical accompaniment is more along the lines of Night's in White Satin and Tuesday Aftenoon, since the music is a large orchestra rather than that provided by Graeme Edge, Ray Thomas, and John Lodge.I highly recommend this if you like Justin's voice, and the early Moody Blues. It's also a great new twist on some old classics when a full orchestra gets to playing Stairway to Heaven or MacArthur's Park."
5,"Barry Manilow Greatest Hits, Vol.2","I like this album too. It's just as good as his Greatest Hits Vol.1. Has some really dance tunes. Volume 1 and Volume 2 are both good albums, I can't wait to receive his Greatest Hits Vol.3."
4,Could it be?,"Well, could it?Rhetorically yours,Tadps- if you play this backwards, it explains how to hand-sew a lovely duvet."
1,A Joke,"There are reasons why this man is one of the biggest jokes in music. Here are 10 of them. hard to take a guy seriously when he claims to have invented music! (""I Write the Songs"")."
4,As Advertised,"The study guide was delivered as advertised and in short order. This guide is an invaluable source that compliments the book Biblical Eldership: An Urgent Call to Restore Biblical Church Leadership, also written by Alexander Strauch."
3,Good Customer Service,"I had given this product an unfavorable review initially due to the unrealistic appearance of the flickering effect and because some of the candles arrived with dead batteries. While I maintain that the candles are not as realistic as others I have seen, I appreciated that the company got in touch with me to offer to make amends. I did agree to keep the candles and they promptly sent me replacement batteries. Knowing that they value customer satisfaction, I would not hesitate to purchase from them again."
1,Candles do not flicker!,Seller was very good and prompt so this is not a complaint against them. The candles do not flicker or rather the flicker amount is so minimal as to be nearly invisible. They look like dim yellow flames but are obviously fake candles. I would not recommend this item. I have seen other flameless candles that do a much better job of simulating a real candle.
2,"Narrator kills, absolutely kills this","A good narrator is essential for tutorial videos like this. Unfortunately, this narrator 'teaches' this course with the passion of a 95-year-old pensioner on double dose sleeping pills. Really, I've never seen such a wooden delivery, with monotone voice throughout, strained smiles as he gets to the point in his detailed script where, presumably, it tells him to smile. And, worst of all, how irritating is it to have a narrator looking at you, but in fact looking a few inches below screen level reading (and I do mean reading - you can follow his reading almost with finger on the page) a script. Did he have to read word by word? Couldn't he have improvised and been a bit more spontaneous?I honestly can't say much about the content, because I was sooooo put off by this dreadful, dreadful narrator."
3,self defense,"this may be a good dvd to learn from, but in my personal opinion, its too annoying to watch. I personally think the music dosent go at all, her accent is a bit distracting, and maybe this is silly but her hair drove me nuts. its funny cause i usually wouldnt care about these little things, but i just want to turn it off after a few minutes. One more thing is that she seemed to speed through some things, maybe it wouldnt be so bad after you practice though. If these little things are unimportant to you, than give it a go. Hope you like it if you do get it."
4,Great intro to the subject.,"This book was a fun introduction to this dreary time in history. It moves very fast and is written in story fashion. The author takes many different directions that leave you wanting to do more research on your own.It tracks the plagues path from China to its end across North Eastern Europe and ends with how this plague effected society for centuries to come.For serious study of this plague I would recommend "" A distant Mirror by Barbara Tuchman."
2,Gratuitous leftwing editorializing poisons an otherwise good book,"The author imposes a liberal/left outlook on every aspect of his narrative. Mr Kelly pointedly uses ""a.d."" for ""AD"" when discussing dates, and constantly second-guesses the motives of anything Western or Christian in origin.One of the more outrageous examples is to describe a post-WWII US Army report as ""admiring"" the Japanese use of the plague against the Chinese city of Changteh. No attribution was given. Thus the reader cannot determine for themselves if Mr. Kelly's 'admiration' was real or imaged - or projected to fit an agenda.If an author cannot tell the difference between the facts, his opinions, and his feelings, he is not worth reading."
3,Can It Happen Again Here?,"A naked woman on the cover enthralled with a corpse stands for the 'Black Death.' The generation which lived through it was called 'the great mortality.' In this book, John Kelly traces the medieval plagues from the cities of Europe, Sicily, Portugal, along the China Sea and Central Asia, England, to Greenland.Thought to have been spread by flea-infested rats from the ships and flooding by polluted waters in the 1300s, it killed a third of the population. There were two kinds: bubonic plague with boils and swollen lymph nodes, and pneumonic plague with spitting blood and lung infection.As opposed to our modern plague, AIDS, the victims of the medieval types died fairly quickly. It was thought to be a punishment from God, as was the plague of locusts. They thought it was 'the end of the world.' Such pandemic diseases destroy worlds, not just individuals.[...]"
3,Xerxes was not Greek!,Mr. Kelly the author of this book writes about the great PERSIAN conquerer Xerxes (who fought against Greeks) and misidentifies Xerxes as his enemy.
3,Don't read this before you go caroling,"Incredible research, real detail on the Black Death. And the writing is solid. I found myself getting restless in spots, I frankly think this book would have benefited by even more streamlining, perhaps even using the technique of bringing a fiction writing approach to humanize it and it make it even more approachable.It does have some fascinating stories and it really puts the time in context. Well done."
3,The Great Mortality,This book traces the Black Death as it made its way thru Europe from 1348-52. As comprehensive a history as possible it also explained current theory on the pathology and transmission in an informative engrossing way. A good book.
3,"fair, thorough -- but a bit too glib","Comprehensive history of Black Death, which is impressive in and of itself. Plus, writer includes plague deaths in other regions of the world as well as Europe, something often ignored in older histories. Personally, I found the writer's style a bit too glib and titillating for my taste, but it is certainly entertaining. One thing I really appreciated were the footnotes. The author's interpretation of events was always carefully noted and compared to other hsitorians, allowing the reader to make up his or her mind which to favor. Nonetheless, I have to say that I prefer Barbara Tuchman's ""A Distant Mirror"" for the best history of the Black Death."
5,Great Book!,"This book was very well written and researched. Anyone interested in learning more about what life was like before, during, and after the plague of the 1300's will be aptly rewarded by The Great Mortality. Kelly is witty, factual, creative, and weaves it all together with a true appreciation of the human spirit. Great book!"
2,"Great research, but hard to follow....",This was very well- researched but the timeline is all over the place. I gave up trying to follow it about halfway through and just skimmed the last half. It's a shame because it could have been a fantastic read!
4,Good look at the Black Death,"This is a good beginning look at the plague as it began and swept through the known world.Having researched this period of history, I don't know that I agree with the author on some of his points. Mr Kelly indulges in interesting theorizing (which some might see as flights of imagination), but don't let this hold you back from getting this book. It's still a very compelling read, with easy-to-follow arguments and prose."
4,Gripping And Ghastly Tale,"John Kelly has produced a nasty, fascinating tale with The Great Mortality, as he covers the history of the Black Death (ca. 1347-1352) tour of Europe. One should not make the mistake of reading this book over lunch as the descriptions are accurately nauseating in their thoroughness. At times, a hint of monotony does creep into the tale as each country's encounters with the swiftly spreading disease is told. The tale does not vary much and is most interesting in the earlier chapters with the diseases first encounters with Europe in Italy. The book's strengths are its discussion of recent scholarship on both the origin and the nature of the plague. It is a gripping story of a most horrific and unimaginable event."
1,A TRUE DISASTER FLICK,"Released way back in 1978 as CYCLONE, this is one rotten movie. Filmed on a shoestring budget with mainly a Mexican cast, this howler focuses on the devastation wrought by a powerful and unexpected cyclone (I thought they were called cyclones in the Pacific, not the Atlantic?). The movie focuses on a tourist boat beset with stock characters and a dog named Christmas; a sailing vessel with scraggly fishermen; and the survivors of a downed aircraft. Meanwhile a band of vicious sharks (with no teeth?) attack and kill a majority of the actors. Carroll Baker (the sex symbol from BABY DOLL) plays the dog owner and veteran character actor Arthur Kennedy is the priest who objects to the prospects of cannibalism to stay alive. Extremely dated and dull."
5,Best movie,"I love the movie,thank you very much from your customer Kathryn O'Neill I told my friends about the movie I love it"
3,This is NOT the Alex Jones movie of the same name,"This is not the Alex Jones movie on false flag operations of the same name, even though it comes up on Amazon's search if you type in Alex Jones."
1,what a waste of time!!!!!!!!!,this smelly load of fish bait is not even worth the time i'm taking to tell you don't bother with it! just not good at all!!!!!!!!!
1,Terror Storm vs TerrorStorm Don't be confused,"This is NOT Alex Jone's excellent video of Government sponsored terrorism and 911. It comes up on a search of Alex Jones at Amazon.Don't be confused. The book ""Fortunate Son"" documenting George W. Bushes foibles with cocaine, drinking and the law was followed soon therafter by ""Fortunate Son"" a book about a veterans Vietnam experience.Don't make the same mistake, get Alex Jones's DVD it's 5 STAR. Ignore this other book, it's just a mistake."
1,Poor Quality,"I paid over $20.00 for this at OSH and really regret doing so. This product was made very cheaply and poorly. The line is flimsy and not strong enough to hold more than 2 pieces of clothing without sagging. The line on mine is even tearing now. The knob that is suppose to keep the line tight doesn't work properly and the retraction will not pull the line back in correctly or evenly. Now I can't even pull the line out at all, meaning I can't use the darn thing at all anymore. It lasted me less than a year and I hated using it the entire time. Wish I would have invested a bit more money for something worth it."
1,Buyer Beware Do not purchase,"We have had this clothesline since May and all of the lines (strings) have broken. I would not recommend this product at any price. I would have to hang one item on each of the 5 strings because if I hung more on it they would break. The last one broke today! We are going back to the old fashioned string your own clothesline on the poles we put in for this unit.Very unhappy with this product line. I would like to have known that the lines are not meant to hold anything of any weight. We used it for our bathing suits, towels and light sheets and it did not hold."
2,"Cheap design, does what it needs to do","This product is made very poorly. When you pull it out, the lines all retract at different speeds causing some very tight lines along with some very loose lines. Also as a tip, make sure that the line is level or a couple inches higher at the retractable end. This way when the line pulls on itself, it doesn't pop off the wall you were trying to mount it on. All in all for the price it holds your clothes and a decent amount also, but I feel like these definitely won't last with the cheap build quality. I would recommend spending more money on something that will last."
1,Whitney Design MD-61 5-Line Indoor/Outdoor Mini Retractable Clothes Dryer,"This is the cheapest excuse for a cloths line I have ever seen. First, the clothes line arrives with no hardware. So I had to go out and buy my own screws and hooks to mount it. The first time I used it the flimsy plastic end snaps in half. So I have to go into the basement, find a piece of wood to duct-tape it back together. Second time I use it its ok. Used it again today, and all the lines on the retractable side came undone. I don't know who to contact about this because I had to cut up the box for the template to hang the clothes dryer ( which was also wrong and had to drill another hole)so I have no box to send it back in.I don't want to give anybody the wrong Idea, I have made many purchaes with Amazon and have been happy with them but this item could only hold light laundry such as socks and underware at best.Whitney Design MD-61 5-Line Indoor/Outdoor Mini Retractable Clothes Dryer"
2,Doesn't hold up,"Didn't really hold the laundry up too good, was afraid it was going to break every time I used it. When you retract it IT DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY."
2,funciona,"si tienes poco espacio esta muy bien, porque si aguanta el peso de la ropa, pero esta un poco chico, se necesita instalar muy bien en la pared, para que no se caiga"
1,Not worth it,I had bought one just like this years ago and the quality was much better this one is not worth $5.
3,good deal,"Ive seen these things for 60 bucks in hardware stores, so couldn't pass this one up. It does the trick just fine."
4,I guess,"Well, I bought this to give it away. I have being using another one very similar to this, but larger. It has lasted for over twelve years. I hope this will last close to that."
1,want to return and can't get satisfaction,the product telelascope clothes line seams very sturdy but If I ever get contacted I need to return because we didn't take in some factors on measurement. My problem is in returning the product.
2,Not very well constructed,"I liked the concept of this retractable multi string clothes dryer. However, it isnt very easy to use as everytime I pull want to retract after using, it needs some adjusting as one rope goees through all the 5 lines. The last time I used it, it wouldnt go back in and I had to take it out as it got too messy to deal with."
1,Computer Crashed,I received this and put it on both my lap top and PC. Both have crashed and I was having severe issues with my computer freezing up. Do not buy this there is something corrupt about it. I removed it from both computers and they are back to normal.Nancy
3,Think about this one,"If you already own PuzzleMaster 3, 4 and 5 - DON'T BUY THIS, as it is all 3 wrapped up into 1, but is not advertized as such. Wasted my money, thankfully it wasn't costly. However if you don't own them it's a good way to get all three for less money. I love the PuzzleMaster games."
3,"Not bad, could be better","There are enough good puzzles in this pack to justify what I spent, but I was disappointed to find so many repeats between the levels, and there were far too many drawings rather than photographs for my liking. I also found the tendency for the default size setting to extend the top and bottom of the vertical puzzles ghost image beyond the visible area to be annoying. The ability to upload my own photos is awesome, though."
5,Puzzle Variety Pack,"Being a huge fan of jigsaw puzzle programs, I washaving a hard time finding software for mycomputer that would work correctly. I cameacross this program and just love it.I highly recommend this product for theJigsaw Puzzle Fans!"
5,Phenomenal musicianship,Purchased this album on my lunch break... my god! A fantastic active listening album that makes the toes curl
3,Existential Fervor,"I liked it, it seems to convey corea's more mature, seasoned articulation of his interpretation of authentic improvistional Jazz.. it is well formulated yet spontaneous, it has a hip-hop sensibility to it yet it never degenerates into mere discord... he seems to be giving us a narative, some insight into the mystical magical side of his existential views on cuture,politics and humananity in general..one discovers true meaning and renewal from previous statements made by some of the people who've worked with corea over the years...I for one was beguiled by the dazzeling display of creativity and harmonic invention in his keyboard work..It is a must have..."
2,OIL AND VINEGAR,"BEING A LONG-TIME FAN OF CHICK COREA AND BELA AND HAVING SEEN THEM LIVE SEVERAL TIMES, I WAS VERY MUCH ANTICIPATING THIS ALBUM. BUT FOR ME, THE TWO JUST DIDN,T MESH. I REALIZE HOW SUBJECTIVE MUSIC IS AND THAT OTHERS MAY JUST LOVE THIS COLABORATION BUT FOR ME, IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT. I WAS NOT EVEN VERY INTERESTED IN MOST OF THE COMPOSITIONS. BUT ALTHOUGH I FEEL THAT THIS ALBUM WAS A FAILURE, I AM HAPPY THAT THESE TWO MADE THE ATTEMPT. THESE THINGS ARE RISKY AND SOMETIMES ...."
2,Chick corea new cd way off the mark,Chick Corea new cd is fair. Chick corea should have played a different instrument to show off how good of musician he truly is. Needs better material for his new one to. His new cd gets a fair mark from me & a 2 star rating from me. Better luck next time. Id advise you to skip over this new release & not buy his new CD.
3,Corea and Fleck,I love Chick Corea and have over 15 of his albums and cd.s. This one is nice to listen to but it does not have the great factor that many of Corea's music brings. Is OK.
1,There are better choices,"Very thin on content, not much here to work with. Thin on presentation. If this was a first project by sixth-graders there would be some explanation. There are good DVDs and there are not-so-good ones. This is far from one of the better ones."
2,No Hard Wiring My ASS,"The item description is completely false. When you open up the box it becomes painfully evident that there is a LOT of wiring to do. In fact, I called the tech support number and the guy told me that he doesn't recommend anyone install this themselves because of the pitfalls involved with all of the wiring which could actually ruin your car's computer system which, as you might know, isn't cheap. Not only that, but he also told me that crimestopper doesn't even sell their equipment to non-authorized dealers, Amazon buys it from a 3rd party vendor. So guess what that means . . . no warranty on the item! If you are attracted to this item because of the direct plug in myth and the promise of a hassle free install, turn around now!"
2,Bad,"Well first when I bought it, I was really excited. It was working fine BUT 3 weeks later it just died. I took it to the garage to see what is the wrong with it, and they said ""it died, we cannot fix it. you need to buy new one"""
2,Refill didn't work as well,When I got the orginal PIAA full wiper they cleaned great and lasted a year with no problem. But the refills for some reason are streaky and uneven in comparison. Did something change?
2,I'm done with PIAA wipers,"I have used PIAA wipers for years. They are great when you first install them. However within three months they start to streak badly. I guess I thought this happened with all wiper blades until I bought some Goodyear blades that were on sale for my wife's car. A year down the road her blades are still great while my second set of PIAA's are already worn out. Additionally although we drive about the same number of miles, my car (with the PIAAs) is garaged and hers (with the Goodyears) is parked outside."
3,The wiper leaves streaks,I only replaced one wiper so I can compare it with the old one (6 years old). This new one leaves streaks of moisture and the old one can wipe the wind shield completely dry.
2,One quarter erect,"My advice, buy House of Love or Passions Peak, or Voyeur Confessions, but stay away from this one. Rent it for something new if you've seen all the others, but don't expect to get your loins in a tussle with the fabric of your undies.Music wasn't half bad, but the women were only so so."
3,Brilliant classic story of our time but...,"I agree with all the other reviews about the characterisation, plot etc but am disappointed by the frequent spelling and grammatical errors - they spoil the overall enjoyment as they are very irritating."
2,A disappointment,"I like the piano and guitar music of Albeniz, and I have a very large collection of videos, music, and, primarily, books on the subject of King Arthur, so I leapt at the chance to buy ""Merlin"". Unfortunately I bought it directly from the producer rather than Amazon so it cost me almost twice the Amazon price. I'm afraid it wasn't worth it. Other reviewers have complained about Eva Marton's vibrato. Vibrato is supposed to aid the singer in establishing an accurate pitch. In this case, that vibrato was so overwhelming it made it very difficult to discern the pitch. The opening scene was spactacular, as were most of the rest of the sets. The lighting was also first rate. I thought the costumes of the knights to be ridiculous. I am glad I have this performance on DVD, but primarily because it extends my collection of Arthuriana. Having looked at and listened to it once, I expect it to just sit on the shelf, untouched, for a very long time."
4,"A great cast, except for the leading female role.","Eva Marton used to be a great singer. During the filming of Merlin, however, she demonstrates the perils of remaining before the public too long. Her voice, now with a shrill, penetrating quality more appropriate to a dentist's drill, and a vibrato so wide that the entire round table could be moved through it, has long since passed any reason for continuing to be recorded. However, with this recording, she does provide something of a comic relief: such stupendously bad singing can be wonderfully entertaining. She is the single misstep in the cast if your premise is that all the singers in such a production should be good ones. If, however, you stipulate that an unattractive and vengeful character might usefully be sung by a voice so unattractive that it is humorous, then you find an entirely new dimension to the recording. Either way, Merlin is a wonderful addition to the operatic repertoire and this recording is very good."
4,Good and gets better.,"I didn't like it the first time I listened to it, but after I listened to it several times, the music took over. The libretto is not in ideomatic English;it's downright odd. It's a grand opera, with fine choral scenes and the plot is sensible compared to most operas. The opera is a major work from an unexpected composer."
2,Past its Prime,"This one is well past its prime. Written in 1945, it doesn't use standard algebraic notation, doesn't have good graphics or pictures, and in general isn't all that groundbreaking for anything. The second part on Basic Principles and the third part on openings have some decent nuggets - but not worth buying unless you collect these types of books."
2,Too small,"These wheels are probably sufficient for use on a hard, smooth floor, but they are useless any slightly rough surface."
5,great addition,"makes moving the sturdy stand much easier. be careful to adjust at the very bottom of the leg, then picking up the other end engages the wheels and makes moving a cinch."
2,A fair start... but could be better,"If your space allows, then lifting on one end to engage the wheels will work. If the wheels had a locking feature, the I would get to with locking and two without and could roll it into the center of my shop from any position. Maybe I'll create my own..."
4,Quick reference for multi-craft mechanics,Keep this one in the tool box for fast references to many problems encountered by multi-craft maintenance men. This is great for training apprentices and helps those experienced mechanics by providing a handy pocket size reference book. IDEAL for company issue to craft trades.
4,Audel's mechanical trades pocket guide,"If your in the mechanical trades this book has an exceptional wealth of information.information has helped me accomplish tasks in supprising accuracy & time.Nothing can cover an entire subject, yet there is enough information and explainations to get one out of a stickey situation."
2,Disappointing,"I read this thin book a couple of years ago. While I am very interested in the subject matter (some of my ancestors were from Sicily), I found this book itself did not read well. Repetitions, awkward sentences, etc., arose often in the text at least it appeared so to me. I would have expected better writing style from an author of this position -- several degrees, college founder, college president. Also, the author, though probably well intentioned, tries to tell much too much in far too little space. When he does so, his book lacks the depth one would expect."
1,Greatest Hits Cover Album,"There are actually 4 covers here, Stayed Awake All Night is an old BTO song. This album was a decent greatest hits when it came out 15 years ago, and still a good bargan bin buy for [$], but you are best getting the Import Krokus ""Dirty Dozen"" for the best hits off of Hardware, One Vice and Rendevous. Plus it leaves out School's Out. ""Dirty Dozen"" is more expensive but worth it."
2,"Don't Waste Your Money - Buy ""The Definitive Collection""","One has to wonder who put this thing together and/or why they bothered!! Over all, this is a very weak collection. Who's idea was it to include all four of their cover songs, anyway?? What happened to Hardware?? One or more of the following three should have been included: Easy Rocker, Rock City, or She's Got Everything. And what about Metal Rendez-Vous?? Where are Bedside Radio and Tokyo Nights? I would have also included Playin' the Outlaw from One Vice At A Time! This review is over once you read the title again...That sums up this CD!!"
1,More anti-war propaganda nonsense...,"Having spent almost 6 years in the military during Viet Nam I'm really sick and tired of all the non-military types trying to dig up dirt and portray soldiers as murderers and torturers. Far too many of these so called ""witnesses"" were stoned out druggies during their tour of duty in Viet Nam and had to justify their lack of real military service by ""confessing"" to crimes that they ""witnessed"".Anyone who has served in combat and been shot at knows that war is hell and will do what it takes to survive and go home. The so-called ""victims of torture"" at Abu Grahib were treated like girl scouts compared to the treatment that American POW's received at the hands of the Vietnamese and Bravo Two Zero received at the hands of the Iraqis. This is trash...pure and simple....and REAL soldiers who watch this will realize that."
5,Great DVD for children,"As with all Rescue Heroes titles, this one is great. What you will find about Rescue Heroes is that there are no guns and little violence (no person on person). The RHs are just an elite team of rescuers who, for the most part, perform emergency services in the wake of natural disasters and occasionally add helpful safety tips to use at home.At the time of this writing, however, there are two copies for sale at $60 and $100. I have no idea what drugs these people were doing, but you can usually find good copies for about $5-$15 dollars. Their retail price from Fisher Price is only $20 per DVD and they are currently still available from FP."
2,Not Up To Standards,"Brent Mydland contributes some nice songs especially Blow Away. Some of the others tunes such as Picaso Moon and Built To Last have some interesting rhythms. However, I agree with James(even if he disagrees with me somewhat on American Beauty), that this recording does not compare to the Dead's best material. There are at least seven Grateful Dead records that you should get before this."
3,The Brent MIDI-land album,"As a follow-up to In the Dark I feel that this album is of about the same quality. They are all good songs but no real classics. Technically it is very well recorded and reflects the Dead's sound from this era esp. the MIDI sampling. Garcia uses sampling to make his guitar sound like a trumpet. This actually sounded really cool live although it was occasionally overdone. I think it is great that four of the best songs on the album were written and sung by Brent Mydland. He was to die less than a year after Built to Last was released. As far as I know he never released a solo album. Although I was introduced to the Dead through some of their older more classic material, this was the period when I started attending Dead shows and the sound of this period always takes me back to those good times."
2,Not their best effort,"I'll keep this brief. The Dead were not a studio band and this is one of their worst studio CD's. Studio albums I would reccomend are American Beauty along with Workingman's Dead. Also ""What a Long Strange Trip It's Been"" is a good complilation of earlier studio dead. For later studio stuff I would reccomend ""the Arsita Years"" But those who love this CD probably haven't listened to very much Dead."
1,"Every team has a bad game, even the Dead.",Even the best teams in sports can have a bad game. So too can be said of the work of some of the best bands. Built to Last has earned Dead Last place in my Dead collection. It is the only CD in my extensive Dead collection for which I truly regret my purchase.
4,The Dead's last studio album deserves a place in history...,"This is Brent's showcase. Its a good album, certainly not one of the Dead's greatest, but a must-have for all the Brent fans in the younger deadhead ranks.I really enjoy Picasso Moon, and would buy the album just for that tune. And the rest is quite easy on the ear as well, like the fine & friendly Blow Away.I think the only Bobby tune is ""Victim or the Crime"" - hardly his usually upbeat self! But Jerry comes through with a couple songs to add to Brent's work and rounds out the disk just fine.This one is a fine example of the lack of pure energy the Dead have in some studio albums. But it is still good music, some of it not readily available elsewhere, and well worth its price."
3,last studio record,"This cd isn t one of the most favorites by Heads in consensus, but it conjures a beautiful snapshot of what fed a lot of the late 80 s shows of this band. Foolish heart, Picasso moon, so on..Also, if you get a chance to read the making of this record in the book 'skeleton key', it'll give you a good inside on how it was recorded and the work that went behind it."
2,Dissappointing,"This recording does not compare to the bands earlier work. Brent Mydland contributes some nice songs particularly Blow Away and Picasso Moon is fairly creative as well. However, little new is explored."
1,HAD TO DRAG DOWN THE AVERAGE,"COME ON PEOPLE 4 AND 5 STARS FOR BUILT TO LAST, ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MINDS. BLOW AWAY ROCKS, BUT FOR ONE OF THE REVIEWERS TO RANK THIS JUST AFTER AMERICAN BEAUTY IS LUDICROUS. IF YOUR SHOPPING FOR A GRATEFUL DEAD CD YOU NEED TO PUT THIS EFFORT AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE PILE, JUST PAST GO TO HEAVEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I REALLY THINK ITS A 2 MAYBE A 2.5 BUT I HAD TO DRAG DOWN THE AVERAGE. 4 TO 5 STARS? BUILT TO LAST? GET REAL"
2,Francis Mayes' style is evident,"I have been a big fan of this series and really enjoyed last year's compilation edited by Theroux. I also must admit that I really enjoy Theroux's travel writing as well. This year's edition, edited by Mayes, has the same faults that her books do, namely, they are long on description and short on plot. I have not gotten all of the way through The Best American Travel Writing of 2002 yet but what I have read is very similar to Mayes' ""Under the Tuscan Sun"". If you really like tales of flowery, descriptive (and dull) walks though Italian streets, etc. you will probably enjoy this book but if you are looking for more ""great adventures"" travel stories, try the 2001 edition instead."
5,Every Year It Gets Better,"Scott Anderson's ""Below Canal Street""is worth the entire price of the book: a vivid description of the city on September 11th. The aim of the essay is not to upset or exploit, its goal it to take you there and make you see the whole through each tiny detail. You walk with Scott through the day, seeing as he did. A beautiful piece.The rest of the essays are all well written, with this year's selection more varied and relaxed than last year's (The Best American Travel Writing 2001). Frances Mayes was an inspired choice for editor and you can sense her professionalism (she is an English professor) throughout.I look forward to the 2003 edition!"
5,Travel the world without leaving your living room,"If you like short stories and travelogues you'll love this book. These are the best of the best. And like some reviewers have already mentioned, there are a wide variety of experiences and information in this collection of essays. I found myself laughing in Devin Friedman's ""Forty Years in Acapulco"" and Lawwrence Millman's ""In the Land of the White Rajahs"" and learning new information from Molly O'Neill's ""Home For Dinner."" I admit, however, that I did enjoy soem of the essays much better than others, but they are all very well-written and image provoking. It's as if I traveled the world without leaving my room."
3,W. H. Griffith Thomas,"Here is a clear cut analysis of the basic tasks and functions of a minister. The chapters are based on material originally given in lecture form to ministerial students at Oxford. Updated later by his wife and daughter, ministers today will find the book invaluable as they search for refinement in their own task and responsibilities."
5,Death of the author,"Just thought everyone should know that the author of this book, Shaw Livermore, died, at age 80, at 5 AM this morning (Sunday 10/21/07) at his home in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He was retired from the University of Michigan as Professor Emeritus of American History.He was my friend and I `ll miss him.Bernie Klein Ann Arbor"
2,what was she thinking?,"'Seeing Myself' was not in itself a bad read. I appreciated the courage it took to cycle around the world and the effort that went into writing a book about it. What I had trouble with was the author's approach to her journey. On more then 1 occasion she places herself in compromising situations(not including the last one) and appears confused with the results. Her references to protecting herself with ""circles of light"" were silly. Her inner dialogue screamed ""I need a hobby"". Overall I was disappointed."
5,Familiar Butterflies of North America,The size makes it very convenient for use while observing. Species pictures on the left hand pages in the upper left corner are most useful when the pages are fanned for quick identification. Information on that particular member of the species is excellent.
5,Great set of books!,"My son already had a couple of the books in this series so we were just adding to the collection. Great price, cheaper than in stores!"
5,"great little book,","Great little pocket-sized book for a casual bug watcher. The illustrations and pictures are great, a nice Field-Book for the price."
1,Unbearable Melody,"When this was released in Australia I was pretty disappointed to see that the two other tracks were songs that Will Young, the UK Idol winner, had already released. Getting the runner up to release the same songs seems really pointless and when you hear Gates' versions of ""Evergreen"" and ""Anything is Possible"" you'll wonder why Gates bothered. His vocals are weak, and the passion in his voice is lacking. These two tracks seems like an attempt of karaoke rather than a number one selling hit. Unchained Melody isn't much better. He managed to make a classic song as far from emotional as the orginal. This is definately a case of ""don't touch the classics"" and hopefully Gareth's original material will make up for this cover."
5,very romantic,"This song is much better than I thought it would be. It has been recorded by many artists in the past but this is by far the best. Gareth makes this song very real, what a moving performance.I fully recomend it"
5,Great instruction for Chord Solo guitar,"Other reviewers are correct, this is not for beginners. It is intermediate to advanced instruction for Chord Solo guitar, and worth every penny.I have both of these volumes (1 & 2) and I review them every few months as a reminder and touch up to my playing. John uses industry standard musical language to describe what he's doing.I think John is a fine teacher, and if people have not yet learned the description language of music, they may find his explanations confusing. Not his fault, he doesn't talk down.I found his discussions straight forward, plain, simple to understand and challenging to put to the fingers."
4,"pretty cool, wind often","Super handy. Takes a while to charge. Almost once you turn light on it starts dimming. But if you charge ahead of time with plug in to car-cigarette lighter it would probably work better. So think ahead. Definitely the thing to have around when bad weather hits. It's made in China, but I couldn't find a lantern that wasn't LOL. I would buy it again for sure."
4,it is what it is....,"Nothing to write home about...Make sure you charge it with the 12 volt charger before useing it.And make sure you crank it before putting it away for the night, so it works well the next night.The fisrt one sent to me did not work and if it was not for the great work at Amazon, I would be upset.But they took care of things very well and I have a good little lite...I think the bug repelent noise works? at least I did not notice any with it on?, Keeps the bugs away from the light!"
5,Great Product Every Home/Auto Needs,"I have ordered two of these. The first one is wonderful for power outages or storms. It gives great light, no batteries are necessary, since it can be winded up. It has a radio and an outlet to charge a cell phone. During a hurricane, it was a life saver. The second one I ordered was never received, but Amazon never questioned, did search the tracking, as I did; and was prompt to refund me, since the lantern was not sold by the original company and the next vendor was considerably higher in price."
5,Works great especially during recent Winter power outage,I had the opportunity to try out the lantern recently during a winter storm/high wind power outage. It retained the charge from storage and I did not have to wind it up for the 1 hour power was out. Lots of light and the radio works very well. Highly recommend.
3,Check that it has batteries!,"I bought mine at a hardware store, and found it lacking...I would have to crank it constantly to get any light. Yet I have used it in an emergency to find my way to my other sources of light. Reading the description here, I realized that it needs batteries! So it's possible that people who haven't had much luck with this item had one that came with no batteries, like mine did."
3,Good to have around.,"The light seems to work ok but we haven't had the chance to check how long it lasts. The radio is very rudimentary and hard to tune, but it does work. It is a handy thing to have around in case of emergency; we have one for the house, one for the cabin, and gave another as a gift."
2,Mine was a dud,"Bought this a year ago and stored it away. Got it out the other day to drain and recharge the battery. Cranked it a couple times and the handle broke. Still hunting for a good plastic glue to repair it. Decided to run it all the way down anyway and it was bright for a couple hours and then went extremely dim for two days. After I finally got it discharged, thought I would recharge it with the included cigarette lighter adapter (no AC adapter included). That didn't work either - haven't yet tested the adapter, so I don't know if it is the adapter or the lantern itself. Anyway, be careful with the crank handle."
3,Not what I expected,Good to play with but I expected more. No matter how I charge it I cannot get more then 1 1/2 hours on high. I even used an external charger and charged for 16 hours still not any longer then 1 1/2 hours with the last 1/2 hour as bright as on low. I would be upset if I paid any more then $24.95 shipped. I see why the distributor quite selling them
5,Just what I need for the next power outage,"These are a great light source, bright enough to light an average size room. I purchased one and then bought another. I will use them in the next power outage. They work by winding them up or by battery. I have a generator and I still think these lights are great to use before I have the generator up and running."
5,Handy and works as billed,"I got this because a hurricane was bearing down on South Florida, and last hurricane I ended up with dead batteries in the flashlight and no way to check the weather because my old radio was broken. This little gem works perfectly and is easy to wind up. The hurricane didn't hit us after all, but it's nice to have this on hand for the next one."
4,Good for a blackout,Be careful this is very small. If you're looking for something big don't get this one. I like it because I am petite and like smaller items. It's small enough to throw in a bag and carry it around with you.
4,Handly little lantern,"As others have said, the light isn't super intense or great for reading, but it is perfectly fine for illuminating a campsite or cabin interior. Did seem like it needed a lot of winding to keep it going but I've never had one before, so maybe they're all like that. Still quite nice to have instead of an old style Coleman lantern that requires fuel, mantles, a steady hand when lighting, and an eye on keeping it stable."
5,Very Pleased,The Wind'N Go arrived on time and in good shape.I'm very happy with the purchase and look foreword to doing business with this outfit again. Thank You
1,a recycled book,I was disappointed with this book. I knew it would have bits from the author's previous books plus new words of wisdom. But each page only had one sentence of advice. I thought she'd write a little bit about each suggestion like in her previous books. i'm glad I bought this book used. Otherwise it was a waste of money for me.
2,"entertaining, but beyond me","Okay, I'll be honest. I chose this book because it was short, and I have two toddlers at home: I figured I had a chance of finishing it sometime this year. And, I did finish it. I read the entire thing, and really enjoyed the ending, but (maybe because I'm not attuned to Great Literature), I just didn't understand a lot of it. Good enough to read? Yes. Good enough to buy? Well, if you like Deep Hidden Meanings, Yes. Otherwise, stick to the popular stuff from popular authors that gets made into movies."
4,"Dark, complex, clever.","Artwork has evolved and improved in this volume, as have the quality of the stories. The series grows at once darker, more meaningful, convoluted and complex, but also shows greater irony and humor at the same time. Clever writing; nice storytelling. Character development matures in this volume, and we are allowed some insight into the main characters of the series along with the people whose lives they become involved with. I was satisfied overall."
5,does the job well,"the PIAA silicone wiper blades work well for me, no chatter or streaking, last a long time, just clean them once in a while."
2,Do not buy wiper blades from Amazon,"... unless you know FOR SURE that what you're ordering will fit. The 'part finder' tool was absolutely wrong- it said this and the PIAA 94065 would fit my 2010 Toyota Prius, but they absolutely do not. Part of the problem is that this blade is 2mm narrower than its 26"" counterpart- a detail which is listed nowhere on the product description. It's also about an inch shorter than claimed."
2,Wordy and depressing,"I felt the author rambled on and on and on and the book was a downer for me. I can understand the bad choices we all make from time to time but the suicidal thoughts, the repeated negativity about her father and the constant binge eating just made this one big depressing read. I know the point the reader was trying to make, but about 3/4 the way through, I couldn't take anymore of it."
3,Nice Read,"The lead character went through so many changes that it was just...sad. It's like when she finally gets it right when it comes to a man...you realize that she is shallow when it comes to...""da dick""...lol...it wasn't a bad story at all. It was worth the cost."
5,Great Book,Wanda D Hudson has been added to my favorite author list. This book had me laughing so much and at times I was shaking my head thinking no one could be this dumb or stupid. Close to the end it had me in tears. This is a very good book that you'll remember for a long time.
4,Good Read,"This was a very well written story, with a lot of detail. Definitely had you shaking your head and talking to the characters. I would recommend this book!"
2,Kill me already!,"I enjoyed her ins/outs of speaking to the reader and telling her story. I appreciated the honesty and there were plenty of funny parts. However, it is very depressing and even into the end where it was supposed to be ""brighter"". The men, the food, thinking suicidal ALLLLLL the time, blaming her dad, etc. I was tired of everyone (mom and friend) lying to her and the main character failing to ever truly grow the hell up. I feel like even though it ended ""better"", should there be a sequel, then she will be back at ground zero.Plenty of grammatical errors as well, but unknown if that was a Kindle issue, publisher issue, or what :/"
5,Good Book!,"I thought this book, while depressing at times, was a good read. Sure, some parts were downers, but that just conveyed the immense pain which the main character felt. Other parts were so hilarious that I had to interrupt my husband in whatever he was doing at the time to let him read or hear it---he agreed, hilarious! Her writing style is witty and will capture your attention, thus keeping you reading. Never once did I feel like I had to put this book down because of boredom. Overall, excellent book. Keep up the good work, Wanda!"
4,Lord speak to me!,"As women, we have many crosses to bear. And life in general is a learning process. We go through ups and downs, highs and lows, heartache, heartbreak, the bitter and the sweet, to find that in the end, we come out as much better, stronger and wiser people.Wait for Love by Wanda D. Hudson is a book full of character and promise. We are talked to by the main character as she is on her quest to find love, and we experience all she does along the way.All types of emotions in this book, will draw you to the character and make you thank the author when its all said and done, because she did a great job, convincing the reader of the most important fact of life: When you learn to love yourself, others will love."
2,Gleason fans,"Anyone into the Honeymooners might like ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" 's Brad Garrett (the big cop) playing Jackie Gleason in a movie. The movie's called ""Gleason,"" and it wasn't bad. Garrett even manages to hide his 6'7 height well. And the voice is almost dead-on.When I first saw ELR, I noticed Garrett acted like Gleason was an influence, and I was right."
2,Brighten Your Day With His Night,"This historical artifact captures Taylor on the verge of his ""dark period"" which provided the foundation for his career. The good news is that it's now available on CD, but there's bad news as well. The first two tracks are re-recordings utilizing contemporary studio musicians, and they're just awful. Clearly, Taylor, nor mentor and producer, Peter Asher, had any involvement with this exercise in bad taste, and the results are beyond redemption. Also, as these demo tracks had been available in previous formats, additional tracks found on these releases have been left off. Considerations aside, the majority of ""Flying Machine"" finds Taylor and buddy, Kootch, having an audibly wonderful time, and stands as a bare-bones sidebar to Taylor's first release on Capitol."
3,The Original Flying Machine,"The Flying Machne is JT's first release before he signed up to the Apple record label.Comparing the album sound quality to other early recordings, this one is a bit below average unfortunately. However, you get an idea of the superstar voice that was to emerge years later.A must have CD to start the JT journey..."
2,A bit of work to install,"These look nice, but they are a bit of work to install. We don't have the tools necessary to drill out the door so that these will fit flush. They have the little lever piece in the back that needs to be drilled out of the door. We would prefer one without the part that sticks out in the back."
4,"Close to perfect, but no cigar.","Good account of the trip. Photos and diagrams are very important features, it could however have more of both."
4,Very good companion piece...,"I loved the show when I saw it on Bravo, but thought, ""More than this has to have happened on a 4 month trip!""And so it did.I'm particularly fond of the first person voice from BOTH men. Ewan seemed on the show to be just a little to consciously charming, while Charlie seemed to be something of a cry-baby--which I'm sure was a bit of a conscious choice on the part of the editors of the show.The book gives a much fuller picture of the situations they encountered, and proves a much more rounded picture of both these fellows. And because I read the book before I watched the DVD's of the show again, it even made the shows more enjoyable.All in all, I hope they do another book for their ride 'Down!'"
1,Tries But Doesn't Fly,"Unfortunately, this book is badly written, that's all there is to it.It's not about Mr. McGregor's whining or Mr. Boorman's fits, it's just that the whole thing is badly written. And it's difficult to try and finish the whole book because of that. Perhaps their co-writer should have tried to edit this a bit better or at least put some patina of style and syntax to it. Unfortunately, it comes off as rambling and boring. Which I am sure their trip wasn't.If you want a travel book with an accompanying t.v. series written by a famous person, with a huge support crew, buy Michael Palin's books instead."
1,Long Way Round: Chasing our egos...,"As a guy who wakes up everyday, goes to work, comes home with more work and less time for his own children, I was really looking forward to some genuine escape, some interesting descriptions, epiphanies, maybe even insights into life on a bike traveling around the world. What I got was a couple of ""priveleged blokes"" to borrow a previous reviewers description, who really do nothing but whine about missing their families, complain about being uneasy in a crowd, and who really say nothing about the geography or culture they encounter.I would give my eye-teeth for a new 1200GS Adventure, with a ""full-kit,"" I settled on a book about it and doubt I'll even finish it - these guys bore me to death..."
5,"20,000 Miles of Strange","Looking at a map of the world, you can really see that if you start in England and go east, there are just two big spots where you have to cross major bodies of water - the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. But besides that, there are a hell of a lot of miles followed by a hell of a lot of miles.Well it's certainly not your ordinary Sunday afternoon drive. These guys, actors by profession, not professional riders decided to ride motorcycles from England across Europe, across Asia, across Russia, then after a short airplane ride across Canada and across the United States.Being actors, what do you take along but a camera crew and you film a six-hour television documentary. It was shown on the Bravo cable channel, premiering on October 28, 2004.The writing is surprisingly thoughtful, these two guys have more going for them than just acting ability. Still I wonder if they'd make the trip again."
3,"Entertaining book, though ending struggles a bit","I will admit that I picked up this book because I am a fan of Ewan McGregor. But I thoroughly enjoyed this book, for the incredible journey that he and Charley Boorman took, but also because their personalities really shone through, giving you an honest sense of how their cross-continental experiences changed them.The whole book is structured like one long conversation, one long storytelling yarn by the fireplace. So it came across as very personal, and a nice read overall. I did find the British slang a little distracting, if only because I had to pause for a moment to be certain that I could ""translate it.""I enjoyed the pace for most of the book, though it did seem that at the point when the pair were truly exhausted, the book lost a little of its steam too. There was an evident struggle to get to their finish line, which isn't surprising. But you'll find that the book reads like that as well."
3,No what I was hoping for but okay.,I had heard a number of people ask if I had read this book. Most recommended it highly. I don't really know what I was expecting but it wasn't this. I guess I wanted more riding details and less touchy feelly.
1,It would have been shorter if they did not whine so much,I started to read this but the constant whining in the first few chapters really put me off. I love riding long distance and would love to ride around the world some day. I was hoping to live this fantasy out through this book but I never once felt connected to them. They even started out the book by pretending that they were just normal family men trying to make ends meet when they are anything but that.I would loved to hear more about their riding experiences or the bikes but we only heard snippets of it between them complaining about missing their families or the camera crew.
2,Long Way Round- disappointment,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. A ""get-away"" adventure that would expose me to areas of the world I would probably never get to see and experience. The problem is, they gloss over where they are and the people they meet. Much of the book describes their own problems with being homesick and tired. They had a chance to teach us about the history or the areas, what people did for a living, about their abilities to help the people they meet--etc. But alas, the book concentrated too much on their own needs. The other thing that was a disappointment was that you realize how much of this trip was done through outside financing and the work of their support crew. It just becomes another story of the ""rich and famous"" and not realistic for the average person who dreams of that type of adventure. There is a lot of repetition in the way its' written with each chapter being written from both their viewpoints..., it grows tiring reading it."
4,The Road Less Travelled,"Mr. Boorman and Mr. McGregor have written a fine companion piece to their documentary TV series (which I have not seen). Clearly ( in my case) the book stands alone as a delightful adventure read. Their descriptions of their adventure are quite vivid, particularly the sequences in Mongolia and Siberia."
2,Long Whine Round,"Not having seen the show, which seems to be what most people have based their book reviews on, I was sorely disappointed with this so-called great adventure!! These two yahoos claim they wanted the trip to be ""....Just [us] on our own, meeting the locals like any other traverlers and dealing with problems ourselves."" If that's the case than why was it necessary to have sponsors, ""fixers"" and doctors along as well?!?! Seems to me like these two Holywood types were afraid of any ""real life adventures."" They act fed up when the locals turn out to greet them (as if the whole point of this enterprise wasn't to draw attention to themselves in the first place), constantly whine about missing their families (this was their idea, was it not?), and complain about such trivial things as one or two mosquito bites. Stick to your day jobs, boys."
3,A whole lot of nothing,"First off love the two guys as actors! But geez, what a boring book. This should have been an epic journey and have me rivited to my seat...instead it was quite booring. Seriously, a around the world journey and that was it! Plus, seems as though your celeberty status made it an easy journy. What would happen if I made the same trip? Next time have Chuck Thompson ghost write your novel!"
3,It's ok,"So these guys want to have an adventure. Great idea. Then they decide somebody else should pay for the trip, because god forbid they spend their own money. Then they decide a company should give them bikes to do the trip, because god forbid they use their own bikes. Then they take a support crew...It has interesting parts about people they meet and such that kept me interested. However, I was lost on the whole ""adventure"" aspect because everything was laid out for them / paid for / provided by somebody else. All they really did was ride the bikes. I don't really see much of an adventure. I've been on greater adventures exploring the unknown within my own state. They rode a long way, but by no means was it an adventure or was it not almost entirely planned out by their assistants. I could have done with a little less of the whining about family or personality clashes and would have liked to see more talk about the actual trip itself."
2,Would you like cheese with that whine?,"I enjoyed Ewan and Charley's first trip, and was excited to see that they were on another adventure. Having been to Africa myself, I was especially interested to see how the boys fared. I was very disappointed in the amount of time that the boys and the crew spent bickering with each other. Here are these two rich guys, on the trip of a lifetime, and they are complaining constantly! While their side trips to introduce us to various charities were moving, the amount of time spent complaining about the roads (did you think the roads in Africa would be pristine?), the amount of time on the bikes (should have planned better!) each day and about each other (this isn't your first trip, so you should know about everyone's little quirks) made the book a bit unenjoyable. I would have loved to read more about the places visited, the people met along the way and the sights, smells, sounds and tastes. Get over yourselves and RIDE!"
1,Tragic lack of historical knowledge,"Recalling his final day in Magadan before leaving for America, McGregor wrote:""Magadan, Siberia. The place that had been in my thoughts and dreams for two years, like a mythical city forever beyond my reach. I wanted to capture it, somehow hold on to it and take a part of it with me when we began the long journey home.""Does this ''''' (modakh: moron) know what he says? Maybe get a piece of Auschwitz while he is at it!"
3,Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed.,"The real stars of this little opus are the BMW GS series motorcycles. After finishing the book I wanted to ditch my Harley and jump on a GS and ride off into the sunset, or, the sunrise, or, heck, just anywhere! The book is an okay read. I didn't expect a tome full of insight, just a good before bed tale, or something to read while enjoying a cigar and a drink. I saw the large coffee table version at Lone Star BMW in Austin and ordered it from Amazon also because the photos are very good. A lot of reviewers seem put off by the soap opera antics and whining, but, come on, lighten up, it's a television entertainment deal, it's not ""real."" I was annoyed that once the boys got to Alaska, Canada, etc., the journey got pretty short shrift. I guess after Mongolia, Minnesota must have been pretty dull. Oh, well. I gave it three stars, which was a compromise between five for the bikes and one for the riders."
2,Auto-pilot guitar playing,"I mean this cat sure can play, but his nifty fingers almost make me doze off... Slumber at the tip of his fingers. This is like tuning down the excitement of George Bensons' most sleepy recordings.I don't mind smooth jazz, but I hope the reviewers who say Mr. Brown had better albums are right..."
4,More Cool Licks,"and catchy musical phrases. I continue to love his guitarwork, if your a Norman Brown fan you'll like this CD. The only caveat is I'm not a big fan of the singing (2 or 3 songs). It's not bad, just not what I buy a Norman Brown CD for..."
5,I Am Staying!,"This time Norman Brown has risen to elevate his musical talents both instrumentally and vocally. Stay With Me; the title cut; has certainly made Norman a stay in my smooth jazz collection of artisans. However, my personal favorite ""I Need You"" is one I sing proudly and I am always in need of the wonderful love of a woman. My wife likes the cut, even better when I do not sing, but nonetheless this work of his I thoroughly enjoyed and I personally thank him for his effort. Just wondering when I will get to see him live at the Blue Note, Tokyo, Japan again because that was an awesome experience."
3,I agree with the good and the bad reviews,"The good:Excellent screen, Media Center features, good performance, excellent selection of ports and storage devices.The bad:This thing is HOT and HEAVY. Forget about using it on your lap. Prolonged use on a desktop is best done with a keyboard plugged in -- the palm rest actually gets far too hot to type comfortably.The absolutely terrible:The battery life was minimal when the machine was new. I never got more than 30 minutes of careful use with minimal drive access. After about a year, it is nonexistent. I cannot even unplug to move from one desk to another without powering down. This is coupled with a power ""brick"" that truly deserves the slang name -- it is actually heavier than most real bricks. The cord started pulling from the brick after about a year and will have to be replaced, and the unusual connector on the computer side means that no third-party adapter will fit."
2,HP? Pass the lubricant..,"I come across all laptops in my profession, and lately HP's are just terrible. It really does take FOREVER to boot up, literally between 3 and 4 minutes which seems to plague all HP's nowadays. All HP's that I've seen in the past 6 months do this routinely.The touch-pad completely sucks, Battery-life is about 45 minutes to an hour FOR A NEW BATTERY (you can bet you'll be buying that extra one if you ride airplanes). And granted you only have to do it once, but initial set-up is unusually grueling.I'll never stray from Toshiba again."
4,Cass..,"For my son's 4th birthday, we are suspending a train set around his room. Initially, I planned to draw mountains and trees around his room; but I do not have the time for such a project. When I found these trees, I fell in love with them and I purchased different shapes and sizes. They look wonderful in my design and I plan to get some more."
5,VERY VERY PLEASED,"I got the HO 5"" - 6"" Pine trees (6 per box) for my dad and he is VERY, VERY Pleased.It is everything that he thought it would be, and we plan on getting morein the future....my mom even liked them. They look like a tree someone wouldcut down for a Christmas tree....hmmm that gives me an idea.Thank YouMelissa"
4,Pretty good,"The collar look great, and is holding up well so far. My only complaint is that for the first coupe of days lots of glitter rubbed off of the collar. It has slowed down a lot, but I still see glitter on my dog/bed sheets from time to time."
2,"Works, just barely...","First off, regardless of what the ad or shipping box says, this does not work with MSN or Yahoo VOIP built into their messengers. It sort of works, sometimes, if you make a Skype call, hang-up, then quickly make a call with a messenger. Also, with the software that shipped in the box it was very buggy and pretty unuseable. Went to the website for a new installer (that software that it comes with doesn't have an upgrade button) and not it passably works. It still hangs up sometimes and I'm very aware that pressing too many buttons too quickly will crash it. That said, when someone calls me the attached phone I have rings and I can pick up and talk to them. And I can call out. So, in that sense, it's seems to be working. The new software is a must!"
5,just smooth,"This album couldn't be more perfect. It's smooth, sultry and fresh. One of those albums that makes you just want to slow down and enjoy the moment. I find that Marilyn seems to have that affect on people. Her voice and phrasing are superb."
2,"Jazz Vocals , sorta","Marilyn is good I am sure many of you will think, I love singers that find their voices ala Natural.She appears to still be building her career. So her vocals are at times like read from a script.......Nice voice but no hitting hi and low scales, no scat. ..Just music you would hear in a nightclub while dining.Not good enough to make you stop eating and go Oh Wow!!!!!!I am coming back here just to hear her.By the way both of her albums covers are very well done. Her Graphic people are great."
3,Arrived without Leakage,I want to make my own black sesame ice cream because I don't trust store bought ice cream. These bags were priced well and arrived without any seeds in the Amazon box.Sesame paste requires toasting cleaned and dried seeds on medium and then grinding it into a paste either with or without sugar.gdz
4,THIS DESERVES ANOTHER READING!,"Daniel Kendrick was falsely accused by a vindictive ex, Beth Carson.Now 13 year old Teddy Kendrick is missing and thought to be on her way to New Orleans to see her father.Dwayne Duplantis from the Sheriff's department was proving to be a bigoted twerp.Joey calls his dad to let him know that Teddy was traveling and in trouble.Tessa Hamilton and her daughter Keely live in New Orleans and help the teen-agers on the streets.

Oh you will love the kids at Sojourn and how Daniel makes a difference to them.Excellent story - definitely recommended --M - add to your list to read."
5,"Wow, actually smells like wood","I have to say, this is one of my favorite essential oils in general. I really like the smell of cedar, but all the other ones I've tried simply were missing some element of the scent. They smelled like cedar oil, but not like cedar wood. This one takes the cake for authenticity. I use this in a diffuser, and it works well and the scent lingers for a decent amount of time. I haven't tried the Young Living one that the other reviewer mentioned, but I'm interested, if it's supposed to smell even better. Regardless, this gets my praise and recommendation!"
3,6mm base; does NOT fit passenger side Corolla (2010),"Amazon's ""Make sure it fits your vehicle"" is horribly wrong for Corolla! Get two of the 26"" piaa refill blades and cut one down to 16"" for your passenger side. This one has a base width 1/4"" or 6mm; the original equipment takes 8mm.Note that the metal stiffener is straight out of the package. You'll either need to disassemble it and bend the curve into it, or re-use the original equipment stiffener."
4,Works for 2002 Mitsubishi Montero Sport,This is just a little over an inch short of the OEM blade but it still fits and works well. I live in an area with a heavy rainy season so I'll see how well it holds up with lots of use. Price is right and I am ordering more as backups.
2,Did not fit 2008 Acura TSX,"These wiper inserts do not fit a 2008 Acura TSX stock wiper body. The Amazon compatibility search said they did. Both he rubber channel on the insert and the metal bars are too wide for the channel in the stock wiper body. Stick to Acura OEM. The seemed to be good quality and would probably work in a wiper they fit, but there was no way they were going in without twisting or damaging the rubber. The OEM slide in smoothly and fit perfectly."
5,Great taste - good protein,These cookies are excellent. They are moist and tasty and are an excellent source of protein.
2,Not particularly good,"Disabuse yourself of any notion that these taste anything like a ""real"" macadamian cookie. While the overall nutritional value is good, they taste a lot like packing or insulating materials. Were I starving they'd probably taste great but then again so would my shoes."
5,My favorite...,"These are my favorite of the various protein cookies I've tried. Nothing will ever taste like ""real cookies"" but this is the closest in my experience.Moist and tasty. And hey, they pass a 16 yr old's taste test also. My son has been working out with me and has tried his fair share of protein bars/cookies/shakes. These are his favorite too."
2,Falls short of expectations,"I really like these high protein snacks. The cookies are tasty but the quality varies quite a bit. I've received 8 boxes now and I can safely say that no two boxes have been exactly the same. Most recently, I received a box that contained cookies with only 18g of protein per pack, and they were definitely harder than previous shipmints. Currently I get two boxes a month, basically one pack of cookies a day, but I will be going down to 1 and begin my hunt for something new and better."
4,trioplex cookies,"I think these protein cookies are very good.They are worth a try.I am on a high protein,low sugar,low carb diet and these fit the bill."
1,Not compatable with S60901,I bought this with the S60900 as a second jack. However the S60900 is branded as Philips even though it says Southwestern Bell on the package. The S60901 will not work with the Philips branded S60900.
1,Avoid Mintek,"Mintek has no customer service! Sent them a player with a minor problem and they apparently forgot about it. When I called they said it had been fixed and they would return it. Another month passes and they simply don't respond. Reported them to Better Business and the California State Attorney's office. Finally get the player back totally disabled. Avoid this company!Mintek 10.2"" Widescreen Progressive Scan Portable DVD Player"
2,Not Comatible,"Player is not compatible with newer DVD copy protection schemes. I got this for my son for Christmas and it has only been able to play one out of four DVDs. The other three simply cause the unit to lock up.While I believe the unit to be reliable, we can thank the likes of Sony and the RIAA for creating disks which are improperly called DVDs. Legally they can not be called as such but it doesn't stop them nor does it help compatibility will lessor known brands. Despite the likely problem being the non-compatible DVDs commonly sold these days, knowing this doesn't make the player play these DVDs. If you need a unit to play a variety of mainstream DVDs, this unit should be avoided.The only thing saving this unit from getting a one is when it plays a DVD, it plays it well and video quality looks good. If compatibility were improved the rating would certainly follow."
3,one out of three,"This model has iffy sound, not very loud, the speakers should be facing us not up towards the ceiling and it stops occasionally. My Initial was much better in every way and lasted over three years. But was only a 7"" and had a clearer picture, I should have stuck with that brand for how much this one cost."
2,Burned out,"I really liked this product. But unfortunately after just over a year, we plugged it into the car outlet and a terrible odor was emitted. And it no longer would work. We were on a trip and actually had to throw it out to get the smell out of the car. It was terrible! I have no idea what happened. It literally worked an hour before this happened. And we did not drop it or damage it in any way."
5,Great Information,"I'm only a novice Bug collector, and don't claim to be any kind of an expert on Volkswagens. The information, and pictures in this book was very helpful to me. I can't understand why the negative comments from others. Could it be envy? If they have so much knowledge about the Volkswagens why do they hesitate about writing their own book. I would buy it."
1,Too bad,"It's a pitty that so many good pictures have been labeled the wrong way. Page 84: That is the Mexico City main plaza with a bunch of ""vochos"", as we name them. Is not Brazil! . Page 82: The multi-colored ""vocho"" is not Brazilian, it's Mexican. Brazil never produced fuel-injected beetles!. You can notice that by the single muffler on the left-hand side of the rear end. In fact, this fuel-injection design has only been used in Mexico from 1993. And more and more pictures mislabeled!I think Keith Seume should apply himself and not let this kind of errors appear on his books. Actually this book is a great collection of pictures worth nothing."
2,Old TV shows,"The film was a little grainy, but after 50 years it is great this is still around. I was corny I realize how much the world has changed since this was on TV. I rate it at 2.5 out of 5 just okay."
3,A few good moments,"The third and final adventure of Michael Moorcock's dimension hopping hero, Oswald Bastable, is a disjointed narrative in two parts. The opening sequence, featuring a group of disheartened and frightened men awaiting their fates on an island that has been forgotten in the world-wide conflict that is raging, is pretty suspenseful. The second part, featuring the villain of the title, is frequently entertaining as well. One scene, which features a battle between dirigibles and men on horseback, rises to the level of high adventure. Unfortunately, the character of Una Persson, another interdimensional traveler who makes brief appearances in all of the Bastable books and is well-developed in none of them, figures prominently in the climax. There is also some sketchy mumbo-jumbo about a council of people who have the power to travel between dimensions. Could have been better."
2,Not Worth It,"I cannot begin to describe how disappointing this toy was. Out of the box, some of the magnets had already fallen off of the gears. When you put the gears together, they push each other apart rather than turning each other. Poorly constructed, I guess, is a description for it."
2,"We like them, but...","I am constantly amazed at my daughter's ability to place these on the refrigerator and have them in a working pattern. We haven't had any trouble with the drive gear being able to turn all the gears as long as she hasn't created a design that binds up. Unfortunately, we have the same problem as a lot of other people where the gears periodically fall off of the magnets. Once I stick them back on, they are good for a few days but then fall off again. The instructions don't have any contact or warranty information for this product."
2,Weak Magnets,"We bought this toy for our 3 year old Grandson because he loves magnets and some old gear style toys that came with a kids meal from a fast food place. We thought these would be great for him. Although he enjoys them, there are several problems. The main gear that runs them all from a battery powered motor isn't strong enough to move the gears well. The more gears you add on to the design, the slower they get. What doesn't help this problem is that the magnets are not strong enough and as the gears turn, the magnet slides right out of your design. Our Grandson still plays with the toy, but because of these issues, it doesn't keep his attention for long. We are always ""fixing"" the design to keep it working. I think the idea for the toy is great, it just has a lot of room for improvement."
1,Don't waste your money!,"My son received these gears as a birthday gift last year. Like so many other reviews I've read, once we put them up on the refrigerator, the magnets started falling off and gears started dropping to the floor one by one. Within a week, we had no gears left. I didn't bother gluing or taping the magnets back on; I simply threw them in the trash. It doesn't sound like the customer service department has been very helpful with replacements from reading the other reviews on this product. Don't waste your money--these gears are junk! I have found the Learning Resources gears to be a much better choice--my 5-year old son plays with these all the time!"
2,Fun but magnets fall off easily!,"My 5 year old son loves playing with these gears - and it's great to have a toy that is off the floor! However, the magnets on the back constantly fall off and need to be re-glued to the back. It's very annoying! This would be an execellent toy if it was better made..."
4,sizes run small,My husband wears a size 10 and the ring was too tight so I now I have a new thumb ring. I guess you shouldn't order some things online. But it is a cute ring
3,love the energy. Good performance.,"Like usually Chic Always give A great perfomance they bring much energy to thet performances. This perfomance was very good.Nile Rogers is the best rhythm guitar player on the planet.Howevr I still miss Bernard Edwards he is a hard act to follow , but his replacement is pretty darn good."
3,Dim,"Nice enough mirror, but the lighting leaves a lot to be desired. The daylight setting is about a candlelight equivilent. Wouldn't recommend this product if you are looking for a mirror with substantial lighting"
2,The lights suck,"I loved the settings of this mirror, so I bought it. I brought it home desperate to test it and use it. I was sooo disappointed to see that the lights were awful. Theyr are not bright at all. They are like being under candle lights. Mirror is fine."
2,"if you need it to sit upright, forget it. It falls over","I have always used mirrors that are hung flush against a wall. This mirror is not designed to do sit upright, it falls over. Its positions are slanted backward, away from you, so you start seeing the ceiling.. I had to lean over it to see myself. Not what I wanted, and it cost a 20% restocking fee, to find out it would not sit upright. It has a design flaw...but functions. Be sure you do not need a mirror that sits straight up and down."
1,Bulky and dim,Takes up to much space and the lighting is only so so. I put on guest room and hope no guest minds.
2,Save your Money,"I am looking for a system to replace a Siemens 8825.The 8825 has, in my opinion, the best set of functions of anythingcurrently available but I have some reliability issues with it. I first tried the Motorola 7081 and found that unsatisfactory.My next attempt was the Panasonic KX-TG6700B. This phone has decent volume and clarity at the base. The handset has good clarity and range but the volume could use a little help. The base layout is ok but the way you turn on the answering machine at the base is silly. The handset feels light and chintzy. The clarity of the outgoing messages on the answering machine is poor. The base is ugly; what were they thinking?Anyway, it ok, not wonderful. But since I couldn't get the answering machine to save messages on either line (it's defective) I sent it back. Back to the drawing board."
2,range limited,"Advertised as a ""giga"" range phone, you would not suspect range to be a problem. When you need range beyond 30-40 feet and don't get it, the phone system becomes worthless no matter how good the features are. I am back to my 2.4 ghz Panasonic which has range, but bad battery life and interferes with other wireless devices.This may have been a simple fix if Panasonic had provided an external antenna port on the base unit."
4,Excellent phone system,"Overall, the Panasonic KX-TG6700B is a great step up from the earlier Panasonic phones. The design, functions and 5.8 Ghz technology are equal or superior except for a couple of changes from the previous version that we didn't like. The display in the handsets is not backlit and can be difficult to read. The redial button is no longer a dedicated button and is on a multi-function button indicated on the display. The directory list is no longer accessible from the simple up and down arrows. We also experienced some interference with one of the additional handsets that is far from the base unit. The style, dark color and small, light weight, antenna-free handsets are are the way to go."
1,Defective Handset Design - AVIOD!,I bought this phone and 5 extra handsets and the headphone jack design is defective - all headsets have failed more than once and I can no longer afford to pay $40 a pop just to fix the poorly designed defective handsets.
3,"Great Phone, NEEDS multiple voice-mailboxes","We bought this for our office and LOVED IT until we realized it doesn't have individual mailboxes for each user, just one for everyone. That simply does not work in our busy office. Had to return it even though we loved everything else about it."
2,Good but failed in 6 mos,"Bought base unit and 6 handsets. Worked fine, but the base unit stopped responding after 6 mos. Fortunately, I can still connect THROUGH the base unit to the outside. Panasonic says send it back for a ten day turnaround. That's 10 days without a phone or 911 access! So if you buy this, buy two base units so you will be able to use one while the other is in for repair!"
1,Completely Broken Phone,"This product has failed completely. Each of the two lines began to deteriorate within weeks and now the phone set is unusable. We had the phone compnay in to check every connection and phone, and it is the phones. I still have to connect with Panasonic about repair or replacement, and I might like to keep them if salvagable. But, caveat emptor."
2,Disappointed,"Purchased system figuring it would be better than my old Siemens 2.4 GHz system. Unless you live in a tiny house, forget it. Bad reception from as little as 20 feet away. Also, handsets cannot be named so you have to memorize where handsets are by number when paging or transferring calls."
2,looking for a replacement,"I had to pause & write a comment, since I have this phone & I am looking for a replacement. Based on all the positive comments, perhaps I was unlucky enough to receive a lemon. This system fails at the primary purpose of a phone, to have a clear/understandable conversation. the sound quality is system is at best disappointing. I tested other phones on the lines to confirm that the hardware was the problem. Other phones were clear, with good volume."
5,Nice phone for the money,"I read through the reviews here on Amazon, but personally, I don't have a problem with anything mentioned so far. I like the size of the handset... My last Panasonic 2-line cordless (KX-TG2480) has a huge bulky handset which, by the way, started having problems; keypad stopped working properly. I was a bit skeptical to buy another, but I like this phone and I've generally had good luck with Panasonic products.Anyway, setup was a breeze. You can record different outgoing messages for each line which is nice. Outgoing message sound quality is typical...Not any worse than my Uniden at home. Speaker phone with handset or base; Keypad on base; Intercom; Check messages remotely; Conference call; Caller ID... What else do you need?"
4,2 Line Phone with Answering Machine,"I bought this to try it out. They are available with an accesory phone and base. I bought the single phone and was so pleased I went back and bought the accesory after the positive experience. I would tell you to price out a set sold together because its a great product and it would probaly be cheaper that way. By the way, I accidentaly clicked on 4 stars and there is no way to go back and change it to 5 stars. That is what I meant to do.....Good Luck."
4,DrJ,Does everything it should except for two things:1. No beep when there are messages to be taken off the machine. This is a real oversight in the design.2. No provision for wall mounting.
5,HORAY for a toy that uses imagination...,"...and NOT batteries! My four children (aged 5, 7, 9, and 11) LOVE playing with this marble track. Santa brought us two sets of the Hilly Track along with the larger set that works with this set. It is so nice to see the kids play with something non-electronic, and that requires thought and experimentation, and allows them to test, redesign, and adjust their tracks based on the laws of physics. It's quite expensive, but is worth it. These tracks are well made and will last for years. They are heirloom quality and will never be outgrown. Do your research and compare the quality of the cheaper models that compete with this product. If you can, buy this one. You won't be sorry."
5,"lovely directing, cinematography, and acting.","Ozu meets Edward Hopper in the modern American Southwest. Lots of luscious greens and reds in cinematographer Robby Mueller's palette. Long-overdue starring role for great character actor Harry Dean Stanton. Beautiful score by blues guitarist Ry Cooder. Great transfer in widescreen format, with excellent commentary by director Wenders. The disc is a bargain at twice the price, so grab it up now."
5,Visually Stunning,"I have this DVD through a Christmas present, I just cant believe how painful this movie is, especially when Travis left in the ending parts. I keep asking myself why did he do that? and I think I'm not the only one who asks that question, I think the reason why he leaves after Jane was reunited with her son Hunter is that he thinks he's the one responsible why they are separated, so inorder to pay for his sins, he brings Jane back to Hunter.Ive seen this movie 7 times now, I just love the landscapes, the Immortal face of Harry Dean in the Desert, Robby Muller cinematography is perfect and so does Ry Cooder's sad guitar slides."
2,The story could have been made more interesting.,"The photography is beautiful. But the pace of the movie is painfully slow. After awhile I just gave up and turned it off. Too bad, a few brief cuts to past events would have made the story much more interesting."
4,Touching.,"It's nice to view a film which is sappy, but at the same time eschews easy sentiment without being (too) soporific. Great slice of Americana (do not dread the word) that benefits from Wenders' 'outsider' perspective (+ Cooder's guitar, Muller's photography etc.). On the editing front, although the 'not so ebullent' pace of the film is intentional, the amount of ritalin administered during post production might have prooved slightly detrimental to the overall effect. Still, this is an immensely enjoyable experience."
3,Unsatisfying.,"Viewed: 2/06Rate: 52/06: A film that brings a somber mood in a paradox of a man is what Paris, Texas is all about. At the same time, I got mildly ticked off by the length of the picture because it got too abstract and too pointless. Basically, the feelings to be explored in this film weren't all wondrous for me to understand. It was a very similar picture to Lost in Translation, which revived the genre that Paris, Texas followed through. Certainly, pictures like that aren't ideal entertainment for me because the message is often unclear and obscure. Paris, Texas took too long to state its points, and when it did, it didn't matter anymore. The acting ranged from fair to good, and the cinematography is very nice. A lot of beautiful shots, but too bad that the story couldn't satisfy me."
2,"Paris, Texas","This was an unusual story, unraveling as it progresses and memory returns, feelings surface, and it builds up to an ending that I am still not sure I care for."
2,Shoot me ... shoot me now,"This was arguably the longest 2 hours I have spent in my entire life ... it felt like much more ... I found myself more than a little angry with the overkill leadup to what could have been a compelling story. The punch line took way too long to get to ... and when it came, it just wasn't enough to convince me it was worth the wait. With each pregnant pause between dialogue (and guitar strings), I was sure I'd be getting up to leave ... I suspect the invested time (hours and hours it seemed) precluded me from doing so. I wanted that punch line ... then, finally, it came ... and it went.This one had a ton of potential but it just didn't work for me."
4,Beautiful,"this film is just great. i didnt believe everything, thats true, but is awesome anyway. watch it."
1,Borrrrrrrrrrrrrrring,"This has to be one of the most boring overrated movies ever. It was so boring thatby the time it was done I was literally mad. I watched it for what seemed like 2 hoursand looked and I still had an hour to go. Boring boring boring. I know movie viewingis subjective but I cannot believe people thought this movie was so good. It wasawful, plodding, boring, and just plain dull as heck. I usually like Harry DeanStanton but he was a total bore.If Wim Wenders goal was to make the dullest most boring film of all time he camepretty close."
2,painfully slow and obvious,"this film is simply too long, especially considering the no-surprises-anywhere plot. I consider myself an ""art house"" film buff, and this is exactly the sort of movie that gives the ""drama"" category a bad name. I can't give it lower than two stars though, because it has lots of redeeming features like splendid acting, the music and especially the cinematography. But nothing can save a film from bad editing and an unimaginative script."
1,Painfully Slow,This would have been a good movie if it had about an hour cut. It drags and I thought it would never end. Lots of lose holes with no explanation.
1,plodding,"One of the worst, by one of the worst film directors of all time. They say that Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space is the worst--well, how about giving the Golden Turkey Award to this turkey instead?I can only say two or three good things about this dud: Nastassja Kinski is always wonderful--and what she does here is no exception. Robby Muller's cinematography is stunning. Ry Cooder's score is perfect.As far as everything else? Forget it. Didn't believe any of it. Harry Dean Stanton, usually very good in character rolls, is unwachable here. Why? Again, this director has a gift for being pretentious. His flicks drag on and on forever. Maybe this ""style"" had enough people convinced to call it art and give it the top award at Cannes back in 1984. I don't know...frankly, I have no idea how this dull flick won anything."
1,I'm Physically Nausious,"I just saw this movie for the first time and I am sickened by the positive reviews it has gotten. Are we living on alternate planets? This was a HORRIBLE movie. The storyline and the characters were all completely unbelievable. The acting was so bad I sometimes didn't believe they were professional actors on the screen. I muscled through it hoping that something would eventually happen to redeem the movie. Even though I spent no money to watch this I am going to send a bill back to the makers of this movie for compensation for wasting my time and brain cells. I hope I will be able to keep my dinner down tonight. Do yourself a favor if you see it on cable, keep flipping channels. The shopping channel would be more interesting."
5,The best movie I have ever seen.,"To finally look long and unflichingly in the mirror and know: you did not change, you did not grow, you still fail to be responsible enough for yourself...to interact in and with life.I guess I like movies to hurt."
5,to those who are unpatient stay away,"Im' a big fan of Harry Dean Stanton, and this his his best role so far........"
4,another great film from Wim Wenders,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""Paris, Texas"" is a film about a man named Travis who reemerges after having disappeared years earlier. Having possibly had amnesia, he later reconnects with his past.The scene where Travis and his wife meet again is very emotional in my opinion the most memorable scene in the film.The DVD edition has two discs with the film and director's commentary on disc one.Disc two contains an interview with Wenders by Roger Willemsen, a 1990 documentary about Wim Wenders, Interviews with Allison Anders and Claire Denis, 1984 French television special about the film and Wenders, a Theatrical trailer, Deleted scenes, home movies with the cast and crew, location scouting photos, and other behind the scenes photos.This is the best fully English language film by Wenders I have seen to date and hope to see Criterion release more."
2,Could Not Finish,"The period is one that interests me so I downloaded Forever His: A Time-Travel Romance. Unfortunately, the dialogue, the characters and the plot could not keep me interested. I might try again, always aware that one's own state of mind sometimes can make a difference."
3,A light Read,"A little Mills and Boon but a good read, light book to read with coffee, a time line book that doesn't quite ring to the theme as usual, but as said a not to bad a read."
3,light romance,"Interesting characters but a thin plot developed to fill in around the""love"" scenes In no way comparable to Diana Gabaldon as one review suggested Still an overall enjoyable light reading romance with the time travel element"
3,A pleasant read....but....,"A nice read....but for all the hackneyed ""mommyporn""...that is such a rage right now. I enjoyed the story, thought it had good development and clever time travel parts....but I have had enough of the pages and pages of endless sex....don't mistake me, I don't mind a sexy book at all but the sex part did not really lend itself to this story and seemed at the most a page filler....a nice read, could have been better."
4,Enjoyable Story,"I really enjoyed this story. OK, Gaston was a bit over the top, but his rival really was trying to kill him, Celine just didn't know that. The one little criticism I have is that it was stretching my suspension of disbelief to have Celine have had so many careers in such a short time and been a smashing success at all of them. I would like to read stories about heroines who are a little more ordinary and don't necessarily come from a celebrated wealthy family of over achievers who all look like super models. It seems a little lazy to me. An every day, cute nice girl who can really cook and is very clever would have made the story better for me. Otherwise, it's just tough to relate. Over all though, I liked it and I really loved the resolution. Also, the hero and heroine actually joked with each other, like real human beings. Nicely done."
4,A Surprising Tale,"This story had an unusual begining that hooked me right in. The characters were multi-facetted and likeable and the plot full of twists and turns.Celine is miserable and has a potential death sentence hanging over her head from a bullet fragment, but didn't imagine how far she could travel from her current life.Sir Gaston appears to have a black heart and treats Celine with disdain for a situation that is out of her control. He is positive that she is in cahoots with his enemy, but no matter the tension between them, sparks fly. The push and pull of their emotions and desires is constant throughout this interesting and surprising story. No matter what he throws at Celine, she manages it with decorum and he can't help but start to respect her. They might be from two different worlds, but their souls are kindred. Now they just need to find a way to stay together."
3,Should have known,The sample was decent but then the book felt rushed and unbelievable. Though I suppose with all time travel romances (except Outlander) are a bit unbelievable.
4,Enjoyable,This is my favorite of the series. It is romantic and funny. I found Gaston to be adorable. The story line is a bit fantastical but I still enjoyed the lovable characters.
4,What's not to like about time travel and romance?,"I am a fan of time travel novels in general and this was a nice pairing of romance and time traveling. The only issue I really had was more about the believability of the 'surgery' that took place. But that's the beauty of fiction, if time travel can happen so can complex surgery in the 1300s :)"
2,Very Disappointed,I have to admit that I was disappointed with this item. I really figured it was going to be larger. I bought this as a Christmas present for my mother and was ashamed to give it to her. I had seen many items like this in the store and was expecting something of similar quality. It was very flimsy and the quality was just not that good. I do not see it holding up for one season outdoors.
3,Larger and LOUDER than Expected,"This is much larger than I thought it would be and loud. I chose the red gem, which is very dark in color and doesn't add any piazzas to the chime. It would be prettier if the gem was clear so it would catch the light. The overall copper color is a nice change from the usual silver and the weight at the bottom moves easily in the breeze, sounding the chimes. If you want a chime you will have no problem hearing then this will fit the bill."
1,These didn't work when I got them,These didn't work! They take a small watch battery - and though I replaced it on one - it still didn't work.
1,Blech,"I bought the box set. Oops. The video quality is at best, poor. My set was unopened, brand new, yet most of the tapes were barely viewable due video quality problems. The content was poorly researched and plodding. Yech. VERY NICE box art is misleading. Don't waste your money."
3,"OK, but a disappointing conclusion to the series","This series went downhill a bit in each subsequent book. Ender's Game was stunning. By Xenocide, the pace was slow and plodding, the characters too heavy with baggage from the previous 2 stories. Still a good book, just in no way measures up to Ender's Game."
4,A little better than the second book in this series.,"Though the beginning looked like a continuation of Orson Scott Card's philisophical writings disguised as a novel, this book progress to a pretty good book. Though not as well done as Ender's Game, it's still intelligent and well thought out.Though Card continues his thoughts about religion, family, and morality, much to the reader's chagrin, he finally moves back to more action, plot, and fluidity.This book deals with who has the right to survice, something Speaker for the Dead failed to draw the reader to. There is no good or bad presented in this book, but instead it's a battle of interpertation for what is right for humanity and the universe.One of the only real flaws of this book are the impossible ending, and Card's reliance and constant explanation of his own psuedo-science. A good science fiction book must be believable at least."
4,Solid Read - Stands up.,"I found the first three books of this Ender series interesting and enjoyable reads.Each book feels like it's own book that happens to be tied together by 'Ender'. The broad concepts of each feel like independent ideas. Thankfully the ideas are fun and interesting.The books do not feel particularly dated, which is nice. I only wish I had read them earlier in my life! They are a fairly 'easy' fun read.I WILL be stopping the 'Ender saga' at this point. My stopping is NOT a comment on the quality of Xenocide which is in fact probably the best of the three books. I simply feel like I've read all the Ender I need.So yes - if you are pondering xenocide you have PROBABLY read the previous two books and I HEARTILY recommend xenocide.If you HAVEN'T read the previous two - you could even still PROBABLY get away with reading it.. though I would not recommend that plan."
5,Great book,"The Ender saga continues. Found it holds the third level of the series together nicely, giving hints of things he may reveal in the next books."
2,Too Bad,"I find with Card that after a while the story stretches beyond his ability to keep it going. That was the way with Ender and also with the Alvin series. In both, he starts off with incredibly believable books, that keep you riveted to the stories and wanting to live the lives of the characters. But by the time I reached this volume I was becoming bored and then annoyed, and in the end just kept turning the pages because I wanted to know the end."
2,not impressed...,"Something changed in Card between the previous two books and this one, the third in the ender series. He talks about religion endlessly rather than tell an interesting story. He seriously could have cut out half the book without it impacting the story, its slow and full of filler. The story talks a lot about sexuality and sex outright which is new to the series, its as if hes fixated on it all of a sudden but it doesnt feel like its inserted naturally into the world and storytelling style he has created. It comes accross almost as a fixation. Its bizare. Im just very unimpressed."
2,"Fascinating premise, ridiculous ending","The book is full of really interesting ideas, but they are awkwardly crammed into a plot that cannot sustain them. Xenocide is nonetheless a fascinating read for much of the book. The biggest problems are, as others have noted, the inane exposition dominating the last 1/4 of the book and the ridiculously contrived deus ex machina ending."
3,not enough action,"I thought that ENDER'S GAME was great. SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD was good, but not as good as ENDER'S GAME. XENOCIDE was the worst in the series. It switched between Lusitania and Path every chapter. This got confusing and madening. I could live with that if that was all, but it wasn't. It got into some very deep physics and philosophy. I found the physics hard to comprehend, and also not necessary to the plot to the extent that it was explained. Also the philosophy was not needed for the plot. All in all it was decent. The ending leaves you hanging, but the next book picks up at that. I would recommend this book if you read ENDER'S GAME and SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD and liked them. If you thought SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD was not a very good book, I would not recommend reading this book or the next one."
2,Read ENDERS GAME and ENDERS SHADOW skip the rest,Read ENDERS GAME and ENDERS SHADOW skip the restENDERS GAME and ENDERS SHADOW are two of the best science fiction books ever. The other books in the series are all bubble gum for the brain
3,Somewhat disappointing,"The resolution of the problems in the book are only slightly more satisfying than ""then he woke up and found it was all a dream!"" While it did offer interesting philosophical views and detailed characters, it felt like Card switched gears and decided on new plot directions arbitrarily (particularly in the Qing-jao/Wang-mu plotline). The final solution that Grego and Olhando devise is a real groaner.I liked Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead, but now I'm not sure if I want to keep going through the rest of the Ender books."
4,A great book.,"Not quite on the same level as Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead (in my humble opinion), but still a wonderful novel. I'm convinced that Card is a genius. He has a stunning talent for telling a story and making you think in ways you haven't thought before."
4,Best book I ever read so big!,"Yes this book is huge...to my standards. I wished that the editor or Card himself would have cut out several of the prolonged scenes that took me a long time to read. Most of it though was very interesting. To my opinion, next to Ender's Game it is my favorite book in the quartet. The fights to me between the family were precise and rolled right along, but a lot of the technical stuff I'd zim through and not think about knowing it probably didn't mean to much to me...and I was right.Well, I'd recommend it...especially if you like sci fi and even more especially if you have read any other book from this quartet."
2,Disappointing,"This book should have been a collection of short stories. It needs some heavy editing. There are moments of real science fiction and story telling, but it is burdened by preaching."
3,Losing faith in card,"Ender's Game rocked. Speaker was kind of dull, but an interesting 180 from Ender's Game. Xenocide, while I think it was a little better than Speaker, could have been so much better if he'd cut mayeb 100 pages from it. It's very long, very dry, and very slow. For four hundred pages he hits us with problems and quandries, then solves them very ho hum, as if it's no big deal. Better than a lot of stuff i've read, but a let down as far as Card's work is concerned. If the next one is any worse, I may forego Card's work for a while."
4,"Slow start, but good","Was hard to get through the first 100-150 pages, but once it hit the point where everything came together it was hard to put down. Not my fav of the series, but definitely redeemed itself at the end. Wondering to find out what happens to the characters next, and how this part of the series ends."
5,possiblly the best novel ever written,"This books combines all the best things about writing. Philosophy, ideas, war, victory, defeat, love and tragedy are all within these pages, READ IT!"
3,"Good book, gimp ending.","This book was really good until about three quarters of the way through. Believable, interesting, thought provoking, suspenseful, etc., right up until it got toward the end. The end was absolutely gimp. Just plain gimp. He works the characters into a situation that seems hopeless. You're on the edge of your seat to find out how they manage to get out of it. Suspense factor of 10. Then he takes the readers suspension of disbelief far over the edge and sprinkles the characters with varitable pixie dust and calls it a happy ending. Gimp gimp gimp. I give it a five because it was so good for a while and I really liked the other two books"
3,"Not as exiting as ENDER'S GAME, decent though.","An adequate apology for SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD.Definitly a good book, but not near as good as ENDER'S GAME."
4,advancing in complexity,"Lusitania is about to be destroyed by the fleet, if a virus does not wipe them out first. Path is being ruled by people mutated to have obsessive compulsive disorder. Ender Wiggin and his family are the only hope for the humans on both of these colonies, as well as the two other sentinant species on Lusitania. This novel is deeply complex with different scientific hypothosis being discussed. The story though complex never lets you put it down. You want to know what they are they are talking about and Card does a good job explaining it. This story efficiantly closes the Ender stories and leaves no loose threads to be tied up. Enjoy!"
4,An excellent story continues,"Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead were two of the best books that I have ever read, science fiction or otherwise. While I don't think Xenocode quite lives up to that standard, it is still a very interesting book. I thought that it was a bit long and dragged at times, but never for long enough for me to get frustrated with it. This is a good follow-up to Speaker for the Dead and maintains a lot of the interesting characters and cultures contained in that story, and also introduces some new ones. If you've read the other books in the series, you'll want to read this one as well."
2,What Happened?,"Ender's Game is fantastic fiction. One of the best. However, the Ender series has gradually lost all continuity from the fabulous firs installment.Ender has become a sentimental dead pan and worse. Card takes the Ender character, the ultimate leader and anti-hero, and turns him into a disfunctional, co-dependant, helpless character.Not only does the demise of the Ender character spoil the book, but the unbelievable, make-it-up-as-Card goes along, plot is so unbelievable it makes one wonder why there are so many subplots. It seems like Card has a bunch of ideas with no solution, so he resolves them by making up a new set of physics where he can pull resolutions from.The hive queen is the only thing that saves this book. The Path subplot is so redundant that I skippped many pages because it was so predictable.Advice: Skip this book and just get the plot summary from some web site."
3,hard to follow,"wow, orsons first books were very easy to follow, but this one had me re-reading pages over and over...outspace and inspace? very imaginative"
2,Card drops it,"Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are good, but Xenocide disappoints; in fact, Card could've ended on Speaker. Instead he takes the worn path of Lusitania for his setting again. In Xenocide, Ender must deal with numerous impossible tasks such as solving faster than light travel, averting the destruction of Lusitania by Starways Congress, stopping a war between the humans, piggies and formics, and saving the life of an electrically based lifeform, all the while contending with his messed up adopted family of geniuses.And Card solves all these problems neatly. What annoyed me most was Card's sudden use of italics to gain emphasis in speaking parts. With such overuse of this device, I found myself giggling at the melodrama - and taken out of the story.Oh well. Card, you've got talent, and I love Ender, but 'cide should've taken Ender to a new place."
3,Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm,"It was ok. Again, I read this book hoping for the excitement of Ender's Game. It was not here. More politics and philosophy...But, it was still a good story. A little long (even boring in places), but good overall. You definitely need to read Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead before you begin this one."
3,Not to great but not to bad either,"I think this book isn't as good as the two previous books Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. If it kinda boring to because it does not get right to the point it just drags on and on. Not like the other to books, but still a very nice book."
3,i thought i'd never have to give 3 stars to anything by card,"Not that much happens in this book besides a lot of philosophical debates.This book isn't really that bad, but at times i had to force myself to keep reading, never did that happen in the first two books. Most of the boredem was caused by ender and his family, the other story line about the people of path is actually quite intresting."
4,"Interesting, but long","It's difficult to understand this book if the last book you read was a book in the 5th grade. I would think that if you read the two books before, ""Ender's Game,"" and ""Speaker for the Dead"" you would find it easy to understand. Some things I didn't figure out until this book, ""Xenocide,"" which made me excited when I finally understood something. It is a powerful book of the decision of Qing-jao who must decide Lusitania's fate. It continues the Ender's story with Valentine, and Miro. Quite a good read for a science fiction fan, but still not as good as the others before it. I found the topic of the godspoken and those with OCD was interesting in this novel. It made it continue to flow and brought it all together."
5,Xenocide definitely continues the Ender Quartet.,"This third book in the series deserves the respect of any sci-fi writer and reader. While it may take you a while to get through all the pages in this book, you will not be disappointed."
2,Card suffers from the Tom Clancy syndrome,"Ender's Game started life as a novella and then became a great novel - just like The Hunt for Red October. Then came Speaker for the Dead. Different but still an interesting novel. Just like Cardinal of the Kremlin was a good novel. Now we come to Xenocide. A ponderous piece of hard copy bloatware. Much like the rest of Tom Clancy's later work. Where are the editors at TOR? There's some really good work buried in the 592 pages but it's one of those books that you wonder if its worth wading through.I was not thrilled with the ending. Wishing your way out of a dilemma smacks of the old Space 1999 television show where they were always wishing themselves out of a fix. Did we really need to bring back Peter and Val? Sounds like a never ending series of big, bloated novels for Card. Just like Clancy."
2,Disappointing,"I loved Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead is one of my all-time favorites. However, Card really drops the ball on this one. Unless you have nothing else to read, give this one a pass. His characters are inconsistent, his science is iffy, and he leaves wide open holes.When I finished the book, I felt like I'd really waisted my time on this one."
1,Religious nonsense packaged as SCI-Fi.,"This book is terrible. The previous books in the series were okay, but this was dire. I found myself screwing my face up & shaking my head through most of the book. It's almost nonsense! CATHOLICS IN SPACE! MAIN CHARACTER CONVERTS TO CATHOLICISM! BAPTISED ALIENS!Think of a negative personality trait and there's a character for each one in this book. People behave outrageously and are practically unchallenged. Love & faith conquers all.THIS IS NOT A SCI-FI BOOK. ITS BADLY DISGUISED RELIGIOUS NONSENSE.After reading I looked up Orson Scott Card. I wasn't surprised to read he's an active member of the LDS church. You didn't convert me Orson, even though you tried to you sneaky little bugger!"
2,Orson Scott-Card realised he was standing on a pedestal...,"...And decided to put his own words into the mouths of characters who for the most part would never say them.The long, tedious dialogues felt forced and unnatural, and the hurried ending and the slow-paced style of the story spoke to me of an impending deadline, and very little time for editing.The book should have been no more than 250 pages long, and, if it had been, and he'd have spared us the pseudo-philosophical clap-trap, then it would have been yet another good book.But he didn't, and it wasn't."
3,A Necessary Disappointment,"I don't give poor reviews lightly, but this book was honestly a disappointing continuation of one of my favorite stories. It fails to stand anywhere near where ""Ender's Game"" and ""Speaker for the Dead"" rose. I admit that ""Speaker"" required a sequel, but this is not what I was hoping for. This book is too drawn out and far to slow to develop. Imagine taking the amount of plot content in ""Speaker"" and then spread that across three separate story lines. Then you have ""Xenocide"". Card's direction may have required some support from these other story lines, but the complexity that was beneficial to the previous novels causes this book to become slow and convoluted.I give credit only because there are individual points of brilliance that dot this novel's landscape, but they are overshadowed by the fact that this story is meant to follow such excellent predecessors."
2,Skip it,No don't read this book. Stay with the first two and you imagination for nothing is worse then when a writer just can't let a character pass gracefully on. Not even close to the first two so please don't read it unless don't belive me and the other twenty people reviewing this book.
3,Xenocide is good reading and well written.,"Xenocide by Orson Scott Card is an absolutely emotionally strong book. It is truly good reading from start to finish. It's good because the characters are described in such detail that you come to know them very well. I rate it a three star book, because though it was interesting some parts of the book were harder to get through than others. I liked the way the book was put together, but I didn't like the parts in the book where the family quarreled. It wasn't very positive and it didn't help the book any. This is the third book of the series, after Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead and is just as good as the other two. I had more fun reading Ender's Game the first book than the other three. I am looking forward to reading his fourth book of this series called Children of the Mind. If you want to read a book full of dread, anticipation, adventure, and conflict that is science fiction, Xenocide by Orson Scott Card is it."
1,Maybe one of the worst books I've ever read...,"...and I say ""maybe"" because I asume that I'm jugding the book not on his own merits but comparing it with the other titles of Ender's series...ENDER'S GAME was an amazing discovery first time I read it, and SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD made what I thought was impossible: surpass it. For me, it's no doubt the best book of the saga and one of the best books I've ever read, so I took his following, XENOCIDE, with plenty of excitement... and the deception was equally amazing. It's sooooo boring it took me about _two months_ to finish it... I think that should give you an idea.Next book, CHILDREN OF THE MIND, is notably better (it took me ""only"" two weeks to read it!) but it's still too far from the two first titles."
4,"Good book, bad publication","Love the series, but this particular e-book has many editing mistakes. For instance, there were 3 missing letters in words within a 2 chapter span. It makes you wonder if anyone even proofread it.Again, the book itself is great."
3,Orson Scott Card should have left the asian flavor out of this book,The first two books of the series were absolutely gripping and immensely entertaining. I wish this book followed the pattern; unfortunately the whole God-Worshipping Chinese Girl that OSC spends so much time developing is tedious and wasted read. I wish those sections were cut out and replaced by something that's remotely entertaining.Very poor choice for new characters.
3,Easy Read,"Not as good as the first one, but not that bad. A bit too wordy without much action. If your library has it, get it that way rather than paying for it."
5,Great Book,"This is an amazing book, I have just read it for the second time and loved it just as much. I never read books more than once, but this time I've made an exception and it was worth it."
4,Great book,I read all three of Card's classics and found them very entertaining. I just became a science fiction author myself and am in awe of Card's writing ability.
2,Xenocide,"Xenocide continues the story of Lusitania, through the eyes of Ender, Valentine, Jane, Miro, and the rest of Ender's adoptive family. However, the story also branches out to include a storyline with Chinese culture influence, which includes a strange subplot with a society which revers OCD like activities - claiming that the gods must talk to these people. There are a number of philosophical discussions, moral dilemmas and much character development. However, it just didn't feel like it was pulled together as well as in the first two books in the series. The ending was also a little off for me.All in all, the book was OK. I didn't like it nearly as much as either Ender's Game or Speaker for the Dead. I did like it enough that I will probably continue with Children of the Mind. I've also heard that the Shadow series is much more in-line with the Ender's Game feel."
4,Depends on the Reader,"Loving something and recommending something are two completely different things. I loved this book. Whether I recommend it or not depends on a few things.If you absolutely loved Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead, you will probably enjoy Xenocide. If you loved Ender's Game and were so-so with Speaker for the Dead, you may want to hold off on this book and look elsewhere.The issue is that Xenocide is 99.9% dialogue. Furthermore, the dialogue is about ethics, government, philosophy, metaphysics, physics, and religion. Of course, all of this fits into the story line, and, in fact, it is the story line. I thoroughly enjoyed the book for these very reasons; however, if you like a story with a lot of action, Xenocide probably isn't going to be your cup of tea."
3,a OK third book,"Xenocide introduces a new world and three new characters. They made the book worth reading. Unfortunately, the characters from Speaker for the Dead were not nearly as interesting. They seemed to have been neglected. I would say that only one half of the book (the part with Qing Jao and Wang Mu) lives up to Card's previous books. Go ahead and check the book out from the library- don't buy it."
2,"Great series, bad book",This book was the longest and worst book of the series. I am of the opinion that one could eliminate this book from the series all together and pick up with the fourth book and be better off for it. I would not recommend this book within the series to anyone.
3,Wish I could read it,Does anyone know how to buy this in Europe (Sweden specifically). Doesn't seem to be anyone selling the ebook version here...
3,"A lot of information, a little hard to read","I felt that Card added the whole Japanese part almost as an after thought. It made the book long and I did not like the jumping back and forth. I would have rather spent more time with Ender and the gang than reading about someone and their following the grains in the wood. This book does setup a lot of plot for the next book ""Children of Mind"" so it is worth the read, for that reason alone."
1,"Read Ender's Game & Speaker, but don't read Xenocide","Ender's Game is an absolutely amazing book--I have given it to countless people who have uniformly loved it. Personally, I like Speaker for the Dead even more than Ender's Game, as it deals with interesting moral dilemmas.However, Xenocide is boring, ridiculous, and uninteresting. You, like me, want to continue reading about Ender. But trust me, you should stop at Speaker for the Dead."
2,Maddening entry in the series,"""Ender's Game"" and ""Speaker for the Dead"" are modern classics of SF, well-written novels with an emphasis on characters that is often lacking in the genre. Even a spectactular novel would be hard-pressed to follow these two. But ""Xenocide"" is not a spectacular novel at all. Instead, ""Xenocide"" is talky and implausible. The Ender books are not all about action. But not much happens at all in ""Xenocide."" Contrast ""Speaker for the Dead,"" which is not by any means an action/adventure novel, but which is chock full of character-driven actions. I can sum up the problems with ""Xenocide"" in one phrase, a howler uttered by the superintelligent Jane entity after being made aware of a huge plot hole (one she obviously should have noticed) - ""Now that you mention it...""Fans of the series should simply stop at ""Speaker for the Dead."""
2,It was ok,"If you liked the first 2 books, those where great. But the 3rd book is a little slow moving. Id really think it over before you read it or buy."
2,A terrible followup to Ender's Game's magnificence,"Ender's Game is one of the best novels written. Not only is it a purely enjoyable read, but it surrounds and is encapsulated by situations and events that will leave you thinking for months and years afterwards.As good as Ender's Game is, Xenocide is unworthy to follow it. It follows a simplistic premise and frustrating story. Even if you ignore the total lack of scientific developments in the hundreds of years passed since Ender's Game, it's still just a boring, unfortunate followup to a sci-fi classic.The only thing worse than Xenocide is Children of the Mind. Skip them both - if you must know what happens, ask a friend who was unlucky enough to read them both.Card is an excellent writer, and Ender's Game is too good to have been followed up with such a poor second."
5,Ender's Game Continued,I would be happy if the story of Ender never ended. Xenocide really takes the story to the next level. If you started the story you have to keep going.
2,Preachy Preachy Preachy,What a disappointment! I had to force my way through it. I think the author was as bored at the end as I was.
4,Zen,Orson Scott card continues to spellbound us with lenders life. What a intriguing world what wonderful people the piggies are couldn't stop reading!
3,The earlier the better,I have read the first three books of this series and I have decided to stop after this book. The first book in the series was amazing and it has gone down hill since then. This book seemed to go in circles and end where it started. I did not find this book satisfying at all. I would recommend this book only if it was free.
3,"5 stars for ""Gloriously Bright,"" 2 for the rest","The part of the novel dealing with the people of Path, some of whom have a strange condition which combines genius with obsessive-compulsive disorder, are brilliant: everything you want from science fiction. Five stars for that. The rest of the book consists of excruciating arguments between annoying people in space. Two stars for that, and that's being generous.The Path story was originally published as a stand-alone novella called ""Gloriously Bright."" It should have stayed that way."
2,A step down,"maybe I shouldn't judge this book along with its excellent predecessors,butI couldn't help feeling it was a let-down.The book is far too long,tackles(or attempts to tackle)far too many subjects,and reads very slowly. One of the reasons I loved Card's first two books was his fantastic ability not to waste words on anything-the result being compact,entertaining and thought-provoking writing. This offering did not need 600 pages to tell its story.It is basically two novels in one, that intersect eventually,but,in fact,the ""Path"" characters and story could've been left out entirely,and the story would have been just as good and certainly shorter. I don't know yet if i'll be able to stomach another ""Lusitania"" novel."
2,oh please,"the name should read Xenocide: how to move from great science fiction to cheesy evangelism in two books?the book is full of shallow philososphical discussion, and religious propaganda. i ma totally disillusioned, i am 75% through the book, just pushing myself to finalize the plot, yes it still makes me curios a bit, but only in a way a bad movie does, and i couldnt wait until the end to write a review. this is my first ever review of a book, i felt compelled to do it..."
2,I was not impressed.,"As with many others, I started this book with great anticipation. I had figured it couldn't miss, after how good the first two were. I was, however, sadly disappointed. It turned out to be long and preachy, lacking the ""fire"" of the other books. Also I came to dread every chapter that contained ""Gloriously Bright"" and her Godlike Father. Very disappointing."
4,"Very Good, and Very Thought-Provoking","Honestly, this book was excellent. It makes you think a lot more than the other novels though. It's not exactly written in the same spirit as the other two but still very well written. Good book, probably the worst of the series, but that's still saying quite a bit considering the company it's in. Keep reading the series. Children of the Mind may have a slow start, but well paid off with the rest of the book. Overall, awesome series!"
2,"Poor sequel to ""Ender"" & ""Speaker For The Dead""","Card no longer wants to tell a story, rather he wants to preach to his audience. Instead of plot there are endless pages of bad, stilted, artificial, ""philosophical"" dialog that has nothing in common with the way people really talk. I'm terribly disappointed with Card & this book."
2,Disappointing because it lost its credibility at the end.,"I enjoyed the Ender series. Ender's Game is obviously a classic. Once I got over the fact that Speaker for the Dead was not like Ender's Game, I enjoyed that book as well. Xenocide continues the story of Speaker for the Dead. I enjoy Card's writing because he often covers interesting moral ground. And Xenocide doesn't disappoint in that regard. However, the whole book fell apart for me, once Card employed a ridiculous Deux ex Machina consisting of some trippy paranormal physics. I don't want to give any spoilers for it, but I didn't think Card had to do it!"
4,theological absurdity,"Another good, entertaining story from Card. He's a terrific writer; storyteller.That said, it's so evident that the author uses his writing to resolve his self-awareness of the absurdity of his own held religious doctrine. To be clear, not just his devotion to LDS, but all religious dogma. Perhaps one day, he'll realize that theology is scifi itself and he will let it whither away in his own life."
3,it's a nice little collection,"this collection is a nice little collection of poems, but outside of the 20 unholy sonnets, nothing great. still, it's a nice collection from a contemporary poet."
1,Didn't work with IPod Nano,Great idea but the yellow/green light on the unit kept flashing alternating colors and the Nano screen flashed on and off (not what it does when connected to a computer USB port) Nothing in the instructions and no web support.
4,Works for my Garmin Nuvi 200,"Bought this to use as AC adapter/charger for my Garmin Nuvi 200 and it does just great. I've only used in the AC mode, so I don't know about the 12 VDC side."
1,Defective from the factory,"The AC portion of my Zip Linq Power Adapter never worked. I only used it (read: tried to use it) on infrequent business trips, so by the time it had become enough of a pain to me to see about getting it replaced it was already several months after my purchase and I no longer knew where the receipt was or from whom I had purchased it. Bottom line: no receipt = no RMA# = no return = a total waste of money. Regardless of the well intentioned Receipt/RMA#/Return policy, you'd think a distributor/manufacturer would be eager to learn of the occasional defective product and the resultant dissatisfied customer in order to remedy the situation . . . unless, of course, the defects are more than occasional . . ."
2,Not for Ipod,I like the design and function of the device. But it does not work for charging Ipods. So I returned it.
5,This is a wonderful one of a kind documentary.,"I first learned of Ben's Mill reading ""The Workshop Book"". Some years past after I read the chapter on Ben Thresher and his mill I then bought the VCR. (before DVD) After I watched it a few dozon times I began writing the people that started the foundation that is restoring the mill and learned a bit more about Ben Thresher. After the video was made back in 1981 he was tragically hit by a car on the highway that was out front of the mill. To anyone that is interested in Early American Industry and that small time period ""Where craft and machine technology lived side by side"", this movie is simply wonderful. Ben Thresher was one of a kind. A simply facinationg man."
2,Don't bother!,I saw this show and then I found out there is a hardcore version out there. Go get that one.
2,Book HEAVY on Math,"The one thing for anyone considering this book is ""this it is a college textbook"" that is extremely heavy on math. As a matter of fact, it is hard to even find a page in this book that is not inundated with math formulas. Plus, the price is ""college publishers price"" that is horrible at $160-$180 dollars.If you are considering a career in ""Electrical Design Engineering"" and currently in college or considering college, then this book is a requirement ""because"" of all the math that is required for electrical design engineering. On the other hand, if you just want to learn about electrical components and are considering a career or retirement in ""Electrical Component Repair"" this book will be, for the most part, a financial waste and not helpful.""Electronic for Dummies"" is much better for those not interested in electrical design engineering."
3,Only worked for about a year...,"I really like how this razor works and how it feels; it definitely gets the job done. However, I have had it for a little over a year and the battery life has gone down so much that it lasts for less than 10 mins. now which isn't long enough. I leave it plugged in when I'm not using it; should I not have it charging all the time? I wish there was a way to replace the battery. Anyway, I'm looking for another one and I kind of want to get this one again, but I don't want to spend $60 on something that might die again in a year...."
3,Undecided- good shave but foil wore out before battery,"I'm not sure how long I've had this razor, but I recently had to throw it away due to the foil being completely ruined. I was so disappointed because I was satisfied with how it shaved and very impressed with the battery life (which had been my complaint on previous electric razors). I often took this on vacation without the charger and it worked just fine. Maybe having it in a suitcase was too hard on the foil though. I was planning to find something else to try, but from what I've read it isn't all that uncommon to have foils go bad... but it is uncommon to have a nice close shave and a great battery. I'll think about it, and maybe I'll give it another chance.And yes, I now see that the replacement foils are available. Initially they were, but only through Remington directly I believe, and at a steep price (as much as a brand new razor- how wasteful!)"
3,They don't sell replacement trimmers :(,"So I have to buy a new one--more money for them, but a waste of money for us, and a waste of materials, not green-friendly. They sell replacement blade and foil, but the trimmer is a big part of shaving for me, since I don't shave every day, and it would catch on my underarms if I kept using the dull one. Lame!Otherwise much sturdier construction than the Panasonic I had last.Get with the program and sell replacement trimmers Remington, thanks!"
2,"Great, close shave... That lasts for about an hour tops.","I purchased this razor based on the great reviews that other customers gave it and the fact that I'm tired of constantly having to change razor blades in my manual all of the time. So I gave this one a shot. I was really excited to give this a try that as soon as it was charged, I got right out of bed and turned it on. It wasn't really loud like I expected, and it was great to get such a close shave so quickly. However, this close shave only lasted for about an hour or two and I could feel stubble on my legs. I thought that maybe my legs just needed to get used to shaving with something new, so I kept at it for a week with the same results:close shave for only a little while. I guess my legs are just different. This would be great for those of you whose hair doesn't grow back quickly, and if it does, don't mind shaving every waking minute."
5,great,I have been wanting one of these for a long time. A couple of friends have these and were highly recommended. I am not disappointed.
3,Outsourcing,This book was very useful to me. I could use it for my studies in the outsourcing market!
5,great backpack,"i have had this backpack for four years and it has been hauled through forests and mountains and stood the tests. the access to the water bottle is very convenient. The latches beneath the pack holds my sleeping bag secure and i dont have to worry about it ever falling off. the netting for the back makes it comfortable to carry especially when you have to haul it for a whole day.have never regretted this purchase though when i first received it, thought the material to be flimsy but four years and many hike later it is stil going strong albeit stained which is testimony to where it has been and back,"
4,Great Starter Pack,"This is a perfect pack for a person just getting into camping/hiking. The only reason i say this is because of its size. I can pack enough materials (including food and water) for about three-four days. If your going to be out longer it may be difficult.Very sturdy! VERY VERY COMFY! Has flaps over all the zippers for added water protection.Though the double water bottle design is a little bit of a let down, its slanted to allow you to easily get at them but that just makes it easier for the water bottle to fall out, lol."
4,Appalachian trail beast,"Bought for my two scouts for the Appalachian trail weekend had ample room for clothing, poles, Nic nacs, tarps, mummy bag, and rentMy 12 year old did not once say it was heavy the entire weekendDo by a couple small straps to secure everything tightl"
1,Warning! Do not purchase!,"I took this pack on it's first trip last week. I packed it with just over 30 pounds of gear. 5 hours into my hike one of the shoulder straps tore off at the seam. I used another piece of strap to rig the shoulder strap back together and carried on. The next day I was tightening the top flop down by the strap and it also tore away at the seam! I had to use a bungee cord to help keep that part of the flap down. Coming off the trail I noticed one of the internal pockets had completely ripped open, also at the seam. My hiking buddies couldn't stop laughing at the ridiculous pack I was using. Obviously this pack is very poorly manufactured and will not hold up under normal hiking conditions. It comes with a replacement guarantee, but why would I want another one of their poorly manufactured products? Fortunately Cabella's will give me my money back. Stay away from this one."
5,Truly inspiring,"This true story of one man's triumph over so MANY hurdles to keep a dream alive is very inspiring...I was considering becoming a consultant for Longaberger baskets and after reading this book, I couldn't wait...To be a part of this company would truly be an honor. A must read for all Longaberger basket lovers...."
4,Nice Bag!,"I bought this bag about two months ago when I was looking for a backpack to carry my laptop, but didn't want to sacrifice the style of a shoulder bag. It is a quality bag. I *haven't* had the color bleeding problem one customer discribed, and I live in the Midwest, USA where we've had rain and a several inches of snow since I got the bag.I gave the bag a 4 because the bag is a bit bulky. Also, the latch on the flap of the bag is difficult to undo if the bag is full or if you need to access the bag in tight spaces."
4,Great laptop backtop for a profession woman,"I really love this backpack. It gives me a bit of professionalism and that ""girllie"" look that most backpacks don't. And it is really comfortable. The only thing is would change would be to make it slightly smaller."
2,Ugly as sin,"I ordered the two-toned backpack, thinking it would be in the pretty beige/gray depicted in the photo. Instead, it arrived in an ugly gunmetal gray with the company logo--ME--stamped all over it in black. It was hideous. The backpack looked very functional, but if you're buying this backpack in this color combo, I'd proceed with caution."
1,Beware Wrong Item Sent,"I ordered Simply Silver for my mother who lives in another state. She called to thank me but that is when I found out that they sent her Nexxus PRO PLATINUM Shampoo. Even though Pro Platinum is in the description it is NOT Simply Silver. So if you are looking for Simply Silver exclusively, DO NOT purchase this product. You can purchase Pro Platinum in Walmart or any retail that sells Nexxus products which is about any place now. I didn't want to put my mother through trying to re-package and return it so I took the loss. I will read the reviews from here on."
4,Platinum Pro,"I remember it giving my hair a great silver sheen when using it previously, but it doesn't seem to do so as much now."
3,Not too satisfied,I was trying to get my gray hair to look more white and radiant; but they turned kind of blue.
1,They Sent A Replacement product!,"I ordered the Simply Silver product and they had none in stock, so they sent me a different shampoo in it's place. I called them and had to go through a return order process. A real pain in the neck! They should have advised me that they had no more Simply Silver shampoo before sending me something I didn't order."
1,Bait and Switch,"Order Nexxus Silver, received a product totally different. When contacting customer service, no record of the transaction, very rude to deal with, and will never deal with Amazon again!"
5,Beautiful music,"This was one of the best buys I could have gotten prior to my Mom's death. I would play it over and over for her and I know she loved listening to those old time gospel songs from her childhood. Listening to it now, it makes me feel closer to her."
4,decent,"good mix of songs and artists, some songs a little questionable how much they are ""songs of faith"" but good mix overall -"
5,I love this watch,"My wife bought me this watch for my birthday about 6-7 years ago and I love it. I wear it most everyday and it keeps great time. Mine has also took a lot of abuse. I wear it at work which can be hard on it... has had several bad impacts with metal and no cracks ... the 1st time or 2 I looked with horror thinking it would be broken but now if it gets smacked I don't even look because I truly think nothing of it anymore. It has been really durable. it was worth every penny in my book. At first I didn't wear it to work due to it is my nicest watch but then it would be "" low charged"" when I put it on finally after thinking it would ruin the Kinetic parts I started wearing it a lot. I took a few days on the production line(work) to get back to full charge but now ... no problem with keeping it charged."
2,Great Watch But Didn't Work Like It Was Supposed To,Let me start by saying this is a great watch but I gave it two stars because it did not hold a charge like it was supposed to. The manual said 250 swings of the arm should be enough to charge it up to last 1 day but I wore it two days in a row and the watch stopped each time over night. I bought this same watch 15 years ago and it was recently stolen from the gym. I looked around at other watches but always came back to this one. Amazon is great and the watch was delivered on time. Unfortunately Watch Grabber (the actual seller) sent me a dud.
5,Very Good Experience,"IT WAS A GOOD EXPERIENCE, WATCH IS VERY NICE AND ARRIVED PROMPTLY. I HAD NO PROBLEMS"
5,Easy reading,This book I think anyone should buy it. It is simple to understand as the title speaks for itself.Thanks.
3,Healey Steals the Show,"Healey's songs are great. The rest is borderline-acceptable stuff for anyone who admires guitar work. Swayze's songs are included because of who he is, starring in the movie; they should be given the boot to make room for Healey's blistering rendition of ""White Room,"" which is in the movie but not on the CD."
5,what i think,"good, liked it very much. was what i expected and i'm glad i got it. next i will buy movie."
3,Okay,The sound track is ok. There are a few songs missing from the movie :-( other than that it's good
3,To: hollyp from Vermont,"The song ""Don't Throw Stones"" was done by Cruzados (previouslyknown as Plugz). I agree, there is no doubt that this song belongs on this sound track. Jeff Healy is great but how can anyone rate this CD more than three stars because half of thegreat songs you hear in the movie are not on the sound track,?????. Oh yeah, good luck in finding ""Don't Throw Stones""by Cruzados (or Plugz),I certainly can't."
2,Great Songs Make for Great Covers,"Once asked somebody why there are so many good Dylan covers, and was told that they're great songs to begin with. Same is true here. Best reason -- maybe the only reason -- to get this CD is Jeff Healey's Dylan cover."
3,"Great tunes, but where's the rest?","I love this soundtrack-Jeff Healey really makes it work, but where is the song that the movie opens to? The one that is called ""Don't throw stones"" I can't find it anywhere and the video is too hard to read about the artist. Why wasn't it included in this great soundtrack?"
3,Roadhouse,"The music is very good on the cd. However,not all the songs from the movie are there. And a couple that weren't in the movie are. I was rather disappointed.Peace Sue"
4,Worth it for the Patrick Swayze songs!,"This is really cool soundtrack. It features The Jeff Healy Band. In fact, you get 4 JHB songs, ""Roadhouse Blues"", ""I'm Tore Down"", ""When The Night Comes Falling From The Sky"", and ""Hoochie Coochie Man"". You also get the amazing Otis Redding courtesy of his song ""These Arms Of Mine"". And let's not forget the Patrick Swayze songs, ""Raisng Heaven (In Hell Tonight)"" and ""Cliff's Edge"". The latter of the 2 was co-written by Swayze. Leaves you wishing he'd done a full length album/cd. Over-all it's a great soundtrack. And it's worth the price for the Patrick Swayze songs alone! Peace."
5,ENJOYABLE CD AND MOVIE,"WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE,I NOTICED A BLIND MUSICIAN WHO I THOUGHT HAD AN AMAZING TALENT,NOT JUST FOR SINGING,BUT ALSO HIS GUITER WORK WAS AMAZING(not bad considering he was blind as well)I BOUGHT THE SOUNDTRACK MAINLY FOR HIS MUSIC,DON'T GET ME WRONG I ENJOYED THE REST OF THE CD,BUT THIS MOVIE CONVERTED ME TO JEFF HEALEY BEING ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVOURITE PERFORMERS,I WENT AND BOUGHT ALL HIS OTHER CD'S AFTER I SAW THIS MOVIE,I ONLY SHOWED A GUY THE MOVIE THE OTHER DAY,SADLY A DAY LATER I FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD PASSED AWAY AT 41 FROM CANCER.IF YOU HAVENT SEEN THIS MOVIE OR ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS CD,GET IT.YOU WON'T BE SORRY HE WILL BECOME ONE OF YOUR FAVOURITES TOO"
4,Six Wives of Henry.,"This is a very good book for all those Tudor fans. Poor old Henry just couldn't find his match.The lucky sixth, Catherine Parr. Was fearful of being out of favor."
2,Dated (of course),"Oh those days before women's lib. Accordi=ing to Hume, Henry VIII's were sinned against, but they were also guilty of the following sins: Pride (Anne Boleyn and Katherine of A), Greed (Anne Boleyn), Lust (Howard), Stupidity (Anne of Cleves), and Stubborness (Katherine of A). Jane Seymour is too limp to have any sins, and Catherine Parr was the perfect wife for the jerk. Hume does admit Henry was a jerk, but he seems to blame the wives at the same point he keeps saying he isn't blaming them.It must have been groundbreaking for its time, but Hume relates too much as fact that isn't fact (Howard's last words) and ignores other things. He also presumes too much."
4,Movie Review,"This movie is an all time classic about a serial killer who prayed on innocent women in the rural mountains of Puerto Rico. If your into classic Puerto Rican movies, you might like this one. The only problem with this movie is the picture quality is not great, at all."
3,Okay,"This item was a gift for my mom, a very hard to find dvd. She was shocked to find the film even existed, although the screen quality was very poor, but viewable."
3,"Love Jump5, But this is not their best.","I love Jump5... but this is suppost to be a greatest hits CD, not just 2 randomly selected singles per album. Where is ""Walking on Sunshine"", ""Start Jumpin'"", ""Freeze Frame"", ""Hawiaiian Rollercoaster Ride"", etc. Those were bigger hits than ""Dance With Me"". ""Walking on Sunshine"" & ""Start Jumpin"" were two of their biggest hits (especially the former) here should have been the tracklisting:1. Spinnin Around2. Start Jumpin' (Radio Disney Remix)3. God Bless the USA4. Beauty and the Beast5. Beautiful to Me6. All I Can Do7. Throw Your Hands Up8. Freeze Frame9. Do Ya10. Walking On Sunshine11. Don't Run Away12. We Are Family13.

3,Paulie,"I got this DVD after seeing his ""Beginning Rock Guitar"" DVD and, this (Rock Rythm) DVD is somewhat easy. I haven't been playing guitar long myself and the stuff was pretty easy to pick up. The only complaint I have is that he hardly explains anything that he is doing. He'll explain a few things like ""The Hendrix Chord"" and things like that. But like the Blues Riff I have no clue what he's doing I can't see and he doesn't even explain. So, other than the fact that he doesn't explain much of anything I think it's a great DVD I would recommend this."
1,The WORST text book I have EVER had.,"This book is an absolute waste of paper. Filled with ugly ""designs"", it focuses on completely unnecessary details while skipping whole sections of useful information. it seems most concerned with making the student duplicate horrible ""projects"" exactly down to the pixel... rather than teaching the tools.Avoid this book! It will drive you insane.You are better off just using the help system in any of these products... you will learn more...faster...without brain damage."
2,There are Two versions BEWARE,"So I bought this book for a class, only to find out that I had purchased the black and white version, that does not come with a disk.I guess thats why I only paid $ 20.00 for the book. Un benknownst to me the actual version that I needed was the deluxe Education edition. Who Knew?As far as a text book...its really no different than any other written aide, which is why I do whatever I can to avoid text book.If you really want to learn a software program use something like Total Traing DVD packages. I can say from exprience you will not be sorry. Its like being in an actual class and what they teach is not just how the software works but actual applications for the real world.Its a digital age...dont read it, watch it."
1,Worst Instructions for a Classroom text Book I've Ever Encountered!,"I had to purchase this book for a college course I'm currently finishing. All I'll have to say is that some of the book is OK, but the authors and publisher need to hire someone who knows how to write a textbook, with clearly written instructions on how to accomplish the tasks in the book. The authors need to make sure the instructions are COMPLETE from beginning to end, and are CLEAR to the newbie, so that they can accomplish the tasks. There are come chapters that are good, and others, that I scratch and bang my head on the desk. I think that I might have been better off trying to figure out how to use the applications WITHOUT this book, unfortunately, the classroom lessons were tied to this awful book...If you are serious about learning Adobe applications, try the courses from Lynda.com"
3,"Outdated, but still useful","Quite frankly, with the advent of CS3, this book is out of date. It doesn't seem like a book that you'd just choose to read, and if it's a required textbook at school, your technology is a bit behind the times. Now, if all you had was CS2, and that's all you wanted to learn about, than this book is as good as any other."
2,You Are Better Off Using the Dummies Series of Books,"This books was required for a primer glass in graphic design. In the class, we learned to use both Photoshop and Ilustrator, two of the most powerful raster and vector graphics packages available.The problem with the book is its lack of description, it's lack of explication. Within three pages of the Photoshop section, I was completely lost. This meant a trip to the library to find another textbook that explained what these authors did not. That led me to the CS3 Dummies books, and a far better understanding of the material.I suggest with all my heart that instructors not use this poorly written book in your classes. You are better off with either the ""Dummies"" or ""Classroom in a Book"" series.You poorly serve your students with this garbage."
4,Design Collection Revealed,"Product arrived before expected arrival date. Not quite in ""like new"" condition, but it good condition."
1,Poor,"The ""Design Collection Revealed"" offers the basics and nothing more. Projects are too simplistic and the end results are visually horrifying. Honestly, this book is perfect for anyone between the ages of 3-5 years."
3,Pretty Princess,"I got this to hang above my daughter's bed. She loves it, but it is pretty hard to keep her from rolling on it at night, which pulls it down. Kind of flimsy material since it is supposed to be ethereal, but makes for it being a ""handle-with-care""- type item. Fun, but not practical."
1,HUH?,"When I read the back cover of this book I truly expected a good read, however, it was not to be. Who I their right mind would marry anyone that hated their race. That in itself was totally unbelievable. I don't know how this could be categorized as a romance because there was none. I just didn't understand how a woman could lie down and open herself to a racist knowing she is the very persona of his hatred. Camille's character was just as unlikable as her ability to forget her family and heritage. This could have been a better book had the author showed a little self-preservation that a normal life-loving person would exercise."
3,Ok book,"OK book...kinda had too much going on, but it was good for a quick read. It was kind of unbelievable how violent the story ended up being. I never understood how stories ended up being so bloody and violent. O well."
2,LORDAMERCY!,"I have to admit that this book enthralled me, I read it in 6 days! But by the end it just seemed ridiculous. Certain scenes were just so over the top. We're talking unnecesary rape scenes,foul language and an ending so out there! To those of you who read it: what woman in her RIGHT MIND is going to play a tape of herself being raped to a packed ball room!? gimme a break!"
5,Wow,"I just finished this book and I have to say, WOW. It moved like the speed of sound. Now I am not a fast reader, but I finished it in 4 days. It was very hard to put down. One reader said it was like a different version of the movie Imitation of Life. While I was reading this book, that never entered my mind until it was briefly mentioned in the book. If I recall, the mother in that movie loved her light daughter very much and treated her fine. It was the daughter who was ashamed of her mother. By the last quarter of this book, my blood pressure kept rising because the story got even more riveting than it already was. This would make one scorcher of a movie. Can't wait to read White Chocolate. I'm wondering it the one she wrote with Bill Dee Williams(Twilight) is as good as this one. I will have to check it out. Tony Fletcher"
4,Passing and drama all in one,"Ever wonder what it's like to live on the other side. Ask Camile and she may tell you It ain't all that. Ever wonder what is like to be one of the rich and famous, respected political family member, Camille might tell you, they got they troubles too. Dark secrets tells of deceit and bigotry. there were so many secrets between the characters, this kept the book interesting The reader would be surprised with the many twists and turns in the story line. Some were predictable, and others just blew you away. The plots and subplots were interesting. Very good character development and secondary characters. I am sure you will enjoy this one."
2,Nice watch but received defective!,"I bought this watch as a gift for my wife after reading excellent reviews about it. This watch looks nice but it doesn't feel like a $200 worth! the stainless steel shine looks cheap and is different from the item picture provided here. the band leather is also not that good. in addition, I received mine with a visible indentation/scratch on the outter diameter of stainless case and will definitely return it."
1,Hated it. Big buildup for NOTHING,"If there was an award for terrible screenwriting - this would win it. Tragic. All the ingredients for an amazing film COMPLETELY wasted by this creative team. Not just bad, they stole my hour and forty minutes."
4,Very Good,No further comment. No further comment. No furthercommen. No further comment. no further commentI hope this enough. Very good.
3,Good Movie,"The movie was good, but it had way too much cussing for my particular taste. I do not know why movie producers have to lace a movie with profanity."
3,terrible ending,"the movie wasn't bad, but the ending i thought was horrible. my wife and i just looked at each other with a ""is that it""? look on our faces. it was a decent movie until the end and that is what i will remember about it."
2,Disappointing,Entertaining for most of the movie but the ending a definite let-down. Richard Gear and Susan Sarandon are good as they always are.
4,edge of my seat,"It's been a long time since I've seen a good adult thriller, with no car chases, no high tech effects, no completely unrealistic characters. The entire cast does a great job, as does the director. The characters are believable, none are portrayed as all good or all bad. I found myself glued to my Fire screen, for the duration of the movie, which as another plus, is a very manageable length at under 2 hours. The ending felt real, and satisfying for the situation. Each character has an impact on the plot, creating unexpected plot twists and depth. A very pleasant suprise, and worth every penny of the $6.99."
3,Gere Again,"I was pleased to see that another Richard Gere film was available. In a lot of instances his films only go to some theaters, if any. Amazon having this one at the same time it was released was good. Gere has always been a favorite of mine and this movie continues to confirm this. This was a very well written screenplay and Gere was excellent in every way. The plot changed as the movie went on making it suspenseful and you were not sure what would happen at the end. The supporting actors were very good making it even better. I would highly recommend it."
1,Horrible,"Completely falls apart toward the end. Doesn't know whether it's a crime move, or one about a Bernie Madoff like character. Then, there's the ending, which seems like they ran out of film, so you're left with no idea of what happened. An hour and a half of your life that you'll never get back."
3,Gotta Love Richard Gere!,I enjoyed this movie. It was a little slow-paced but picked up mid-way. Plot was good also. I recommend it to those who love a good in-depth movie!
3,Huh?,I thought it meandered too much and in the end Gere's character doesn't get his comeuppance - and Susan Sarandon is totally wasted in a role that could have been meatier.
1,Movei?,"I was wanting to see the movie not a ten minute recap? Pay attention to the fine print, also Amazon 5.99 and 4.99 for a movie rental? Pleaassseee, your killing me! Can you say Netflix.. That's where I will be going from now on."
4,Love Richard Gere,I thought this movie had a great plot. Richard Gere was wonderful. The storyline was very interesting and held your interest to the end.
3,It's unfortunate this is actually the way life is,"I thought, was hoping, that he'd drop dead at the end but he didn't. Hopefully in real life he would have."
3,Great acting,"Richard Gere at his best, perhaps oscar worthy. It is a very intense movie with a great twist. I would recommend this movie."
1,Total waste of time...,"I thought because of the actors in the movie, it would be worth watching; not so, weak story line and weak acting. This movie has so many things going on, with a little creativity, they could have been resolved. Too many loose threads and the ending of the movie is just terrible - boom,it's over no resolution! Your time is more valuable than to spend it watching this movie."
2,Sorry I spent money on this,"Since it was not a free Prime movie I had higher hopes, especially after reading some of the reviews. Generally, not too interesting to me. Terrible ending. I won't give a spoiler here, but if you read a particular low-rated review from the last couple of days you will find out what the ending is."
1,movie was not delivered,"I ordered this movie for rental but it never appeared in my videos list, and the instructions to go to amazon.co/library to download to my TIVO just got me to a blank my videos page. This was not due to being logged into the wrong account.."
3,Arbitrage,"Plot was ok, I would like to have known more about how he got in to finical trouble. The movie dragged a bit in the middle"
3,ok,ok movie - hated the endinglove anything richard gere hes alwys great storyline needs moresusansarandon is also good
4,Just like it only different,"I liked the movie; however, the story line was strikingly similar to the movie he did with Diane Lane - ""Unfaithful"". Gere has gotten better over the years and I still watch anything he does but this one just kept reminding me of the other and I couldn't quite get past that. I always love Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon combo though and they had a different chemistry going on in Arbitrage."
2,Actors great but story predictable,Not a favorite for me. I found the story to be very predictable although watching Richard Gere made it tolerable.
2,could not download it to my ipad,"Never saw the movie, unfortunately. That's what I get for downloading a movie at 3:30 in the morning. No place to go for help."
3,A decent enough thriller (3.5 stars),"Not sure what to expect from this movie, I was not overly excited from the description of this movie, but I did find that this was a decent enough dramatic thriller that makes you wonder how things will end. Although the story is not terribly original and seems to borrow from the pages of the news it does a decent enough job to give you an entertaining story. The acting is solid and the story entertaining, although it has some plot holes for sure. Its worthy of a rent, but not sure it would bring you back over and over to watch again and again."
1,No Ending and totally predictable,No originality at all...story's been told a million times...yawn. Oh yeah... and this movie does not have an ending! very disappointed.
5,Great Movie,Is definately worth watching and highly recommend. Kept me guessing throughout the whole movie and didn't want it to end.
2,It was OK....,"This movie was very highly rated by many critics in terms of Richard Gere's performance and while that was OK, the movie itself was only so-so. The plot was a bit contrived and the characters are not at all likable even in terms of caring what happens to them. We found ourselves asking when it would be over. It was quite boring!"
2,not a very good movie needed a better plot,Most of the movie dragged and was not interesting in the leastvery dissapointed in Richard Geres acting and the role he played was not real pausible
3,Ummm.....,"Ok, it alright, believable....I don't know. I'd rent it for $1,99 but that's all and I like Richard Gere. I think they have cast him in this same genre role one too many times. Sorry Richard :("
4,Great suspenseful movie.,Another great movie with Gere and Sarandan playing husband and wife while he is cheating. The twists and turns will keep your attention throughout the movie. Only complaint is the cost on Amazon was $6.99 and I did not catch that since used to paying $3.99 typically or free with Prime. See the movie for sure...but you may want to wait till it comes down in price.
3,Wait until it is 3.99 rental or less,"If you are wondering if you should see this on the big screen - don't. It is a total rental. The 6.99 I paid to rent it is an ok value, better than paying that per person to see a movie.I fell asleep in it a few times. I normally do not sleep in movies. So if you get a chance to watch it, I would do it on HBO or Showtime or whoever picks it up rather than pay for it.I did not turn my soundbar on to watch this, I just did it through the tv and it was kind of irritating because it is one of those movies where they go from load background noise to whispering and it is hard to understand. Maybe it would have been better if my soundbar was on; however, since it wasn't an action flick I did not bother.I think they thought the ending was a cliff hanger, I just thought it was boring. Did not love it."
4,Arbitrage,"I found this movie entertaining and thought provoking. Richard Gere is cast perfectly as the patriarch of this family drama as well as the supporting cast. This movie is a nice mix of drama, thrills & chills. I will definitely recommend this movie to friends & family.Arbitrage (Watch While it's in Theaters)"
3,It's OK,"I'm fans of all the actors in this movie so I wanted to see it. I loved the idea that I could rent a current movie from Amazon! I'm just not sure what the ""moral of the story"" was supposed to be. It is a subtle thriller and if there's a message, it must be so subtle that I didn't get it. I thought it was going to be an indictment on greed, but it isn't. I thought Susan Sarandon's character would have been stronger, but she isn't."
3,Good movie if you don't mind language,It had a good story line but didn't like the bad language. I have a hard time watching movies when you hear the F word constantly.
3,Acceptable,"Not a great movie, an acceptable thriller, but Richard Gere is is always so enjoyable....!!! Good choice for a Sunday afternoon."
2,Ho Hum story with frequently used plots.,"I really like Richard Gere but I think that this movies is quite below his ability. The movement and themes of this film have been used time and time again so that the viewer knows what will happen which leads to a boring repetitive theme seen in so many other movies. Originality is missing in today's hollywood productions. ,"
1,waste of time,"I have rented this movie from red-box. this movie is a big shame and waste of time, I am disappointed with Richard Gear . I wish there is zero star rating, instead of one star minimum, then I would choose it (zero star)"
1,Unnecessary language,90% of the sentences contained the 'F' word. Why can't they find a more intelligent way to write a script?
1,Yawn.,"Great waste of money. Both my wife and I fell asleep just twenty minutes into the movie, slow isn't descriptive enough."
1,Lousy Movie,Not worth watching. These big stars should know better than to accept such poor roles as this.A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT
2,Yawn!,"It's about Wall Street..so the guy is a crook. It's about the wealthy....so the guy is an adulterer.....His girl friend does Coke (very 1982)....I think I've seen this ""plot"" before...at least 100 times. Does Hollywood just reach in a drawer and pull out this formulaic stuff?"
2,Poor storyline,Never built much of a solid story all the way till the end and then the ending was abrupt. There wasn't really any mystery.
2,Arbitage,"I was recommended by another to see this movie. So sorry I tried to see this movie, just couldn't get into it. I had to abandon it and watch something else."
4,Drama of human vices,"Richard Gere is excellent, although there was more profanity than was necessary to impact the storyline. Check it out soon."
4,Another Richard Gere hit,"As usual, Richard Gere was great. The story depicts the lack of moral responsibilty found in financial circles but the only justification is greed. The acting is great and the characters are well portrayed.."
4,Very Well Done,We really enjoyed this movie. Intrigue with a little sex and suspense thrown in for good measure. I would definitely recommend it!
2,Airbgarabage,"Slow, acting was great. Just not enough meat on the bone. Would not recommend at all ever. The chandelier was spectacular."
1,Boring,One of the Worst movies I have seen in a long time no storyline no plot and a horrible and no real ending. Very disappointing
4,Got my attention,"Watched the 10 min preview, definitely got my attention and I plan to watch the movie when time allows. Looks like this might have a good story and some interesting twists."
4,Well worth your time,"Arbitrage is well-written, well-acted and engrossing. Richard Gere's performance is pitch-perfect as he presents a character who is likable yet morally ambiguous. You find yourself rooting for him, despite the things he has done."
4,if you like Richard Gere....,He's still got it. I don't know if he'll every surpass his role in Primal Fear -- but this is a pretty good effort. Full of suspense and very current topic.
3,Good Movie - Disappointing Ending,"This movie was good as far as star quality and plot. It was intriguing and indicative of just how easily life situations can quickly get out of hand. Since I do not want to ruin it for anyone who may want to see it, just know that the ending sucks! Otherwise, the movie as a whole was pretty good; predictable, but good."
3,Not the best Richard Gere's movie,"The same old Ricard Gere, the same character, nothing new. Ok to watch on evening if you want to relax."
4,Pretty good,"Loved the pairing with Susan Sarandon, Richard Gere is good as always, and a pretty good story line as well"
5,A great film,"This is a really good film, with great twists and character studies. It keeps you in suspense until the very end. Worth watching for sure!"
2,Arbitrage,"Script needed editing, and writing was weak. Two very talented actors didn't shine. Lost interest in Richard Gere's character and Susan Sarandon's part was limited. Just a mediocre movie"
2,gilgamesh,"This film was not up to the standards I expect from such actors as Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon; the plotting and dialog were the products of lazy tradecraft. In particular the repeated use of the F word by all major actors was not only off putting but unrealistic; I am a business executive and regulary engage in dialog with conpetitors and the use of the F word is almost non existent. Finally, the ending of this loosely woven drama was predictable from the middle of the film. Overall, I wouldn't even recommend the film as a rental."
2,Sorry Richard,As I was watching this movie I slowly became aware I was going to finish watching this movie only because I paid for it. Perhaps I was just in a crappy mood but I thought his acting pretty much sucked. It moved slow.
4,Real Human Dilemnas,"I saw this film on the big screen. I have not stopped thinking about it since. Richard Gere's character should not be compared to Madoff - he was not running a Ponzi scheme although he did cover up one really bad investment, which he was trying to make right for his investors by committing several crimes. Normally I do not approve of entertainment that makes the bad guy a sympathetic character but I am not sure Robert Miller was evil. To those folks that thought he won in the end; you are mistaken. He lost the things that were most important to him. This is probably the reaction that Richard Gere was trying to evoke. I recommend this film."
3,Arbitrage Blu Ray,"It was okay, but pretty predictable. The content was just another attempt to demonize those who have money. I would not watch it again."
4,Great acting and storyline,"Great acting by Richard Geer and Susan Sarandon. Intresting storyline with several subplots all with moral dilemmas including infidelity, family vs. career, racial issues surrounding a scapegoat character,etc. Not usually interested in these types of financial dramas, but it's more than that...more social issues than the financial stuff."
2,Boring,Don't waste your time or money. Keep looking for some other movie to watch. You should clip your toe nails!
3,"Good Story, Poor Ending","Cast & acting were great, and very believable, but that the lead character got away with the crime was not satisfying."
3,Arbitrage,I felt the plot was a bit thin.It didnt exactly have me on the edge of my seat. Still it was easy watching. Nice acting from Richard and Susan.They have had plenty of practice.
4,The 1% Really Do Escape Any Consequences,"About two hours into this movie, I thought the director, Nicholas Jarecki, was going to give us a conventional Hollywood movie -- one in which the wrongdoers are punished.And I got ready to switch it off, because I know that Wall Street lions like this film's main character don't get punished for their crimes in our country -- they get nominated to run for President as Republicans.But no; Jarecki gives us the reality, not the Hollywood feel-good spin. The protagonist, Richard Miller, as played by Richard Gere, has his Chappaquiddick moment, walking away from his dying girlfriend in a car he crashed, and fudges $461 million on his books so he can flip his company to become even more obscenely rich.At the end, is he on trial? Is he behind bars? Is he even the subject of derision on Gawker or Page Six for his excesses? No: he's accepting an award at a black tie dinner, a rich man who has gamed the system and escaped all consequences: America in 2012."
1,Utterly disappointing,"We did not think this was Gere's career-high. Sarandon, usually wonderful, didn't have enough to do and appeared to phone this in. Big waste of money - don't fall for the great reviews."
1,Waste of time,"Very disappointed with this movie. Richard Gere and Susan Surandon - both good actors, not sure why agreed to attend this movie."
4,Gripping Tale,"My boyfriend and I watched Arbitrage and it held our attention the whole time PLUS we discussed it afterwards (something usually done after a foreign flick) and again last night at dinner. It was interesting because he started actually rooting for Richard Gere's character towards the end and asked me if I did as well--no, I was rooting for the wife and daughter! Not sure if that's a difference between the sexes or just us. I'd be interested to know if others responded the same way.It's about time Hollywood put out a decent movie without relying on chase scenes and explosions. Very good movie and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a film with dialogue!"
1,Did someone embezzle the money set aside for the proper ending to this movie?,"The following words were written by GeeJay. ""I was excited to see this movie and was loving it until it abruptly ended without resolving any of the many story lines. I was terribly disappointed and would not recommend it to anyone."" I could not have expressed my feelings about this movie better so I borrowed the review."
1,Arbitrage,Ending ruined the whole movie. What was that? It's like they got bored with their own story and just gave up. Bummer.
3,arbitage,Well acted by all actors and actresses as well as a good story line. Disappointed in the abrupt ending and lack of closure.
4,Suspense!,Full of suspense & kept my attention! A really great drama that is very entertaining. Weird ending but I definitely recommend!
1,Boring,Never managed to get through more than the first half. What a waste of time. Implausible plot. Poor acting. Save your money.
3,Nothing to Write Home About,"It was an average movie and certainly not Oscar-worthy.I initially checked out this movie because some people on other websites were saying that Richard Gere deserved to be nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in that movie. He was good, there's no denying that, but his good performance was outshone by the weak plot and story line.The climax was disappointing at best, predictable and nothing that will take your breath away. How many similar movies have been released over the years? Hundreds, perhaps thousands. The movie was, overall, just average, nothing special."
2,Surprisingly bad,I was expecting it to be good especially with Richard Gere. I was surprised at how bad it was. I guess all the expected twists and turns was supposed to make this seems more interesting. But instead it just seemed to be a story about a man who had money and uses money to get away with murder.
3,Not bad....,Movie didn't disappoint. Reasonable entertainment value. Richard Gere did a good job- Susan Sarandon wasted in this part-too little screen time.
3,Weak ending,"Decent story line, good acting, drags on at times, and disappointing ending. Susan Sarandon is great as always, and should have had more of a role. Richard Gere was typical Richard. Marion Cotillard should have been cast as the mistress."
3,Follow the sleazy Wall Street $$,"Watch Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon (and their assorted hanger onner's) sell their souls at the expense of others....all to keep pumping up their power and ego and money. Not a great film, but a watchable one. Sleazy Wall Street types/socialites with very little personal integrity. B"
3,good stuff,"The movie was full of lies and cover-ups. I wasnt happy with the ending, but the build-up and climax was good."
2,A poor imitation of Wall Steet!,"This was not a good role for Richard Gere. He has made movies I have enjoyed. ""Unfaithful"" for example. Mr. Gere just wasn't believable as a tough arbitrager. The plot was about as exciting as watching paint dry. I fell asleep twice, the car crash woke me up once. The second time was when my dog wanted to go outside. I gave it 2 stars for the scenery."
2,Ok but predictable,"The characters were stereotypes, the plot was predictable, and I felt I had seen this movie several times before. I am glad I didn't pay full price at the theater."
4,Pretty Good,"Yeah we've seen films like this before. Good ones too (""Wall Street"" and ""Margin Call"" come to mind for me). But this one's pretty good too.Gere said (I'm paraphrasing) that this was like a film from the 1970's when films went into characters a bit more deeply, and also that it reminded him of Sidney Lumet. I totally agree with those characterizations. The plot didn't knock me out, but it's an enjoyable film."
4,Worth The Watch,"What's not to like? Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon,interesting storyline,witty banter. Would I take the time to watch it again? In a hearbeat!"
1,boring trailer,I'm not going to watch based on the boring trailer. I want my 10 minutes back! And who in HELL would prefer another woman over Susan Sarandon?
3,Great beginning....fell apart towards the end,The movie started out great. It was very exciting. Good plot and development. Then towards the end too much new information was introduced without substance which was disappointing. Still entertaining so not a total waste of time.
2,disappointed!!,"We were disappointed in this movie , the story line is tired, the acting was uninspired. Considering the cast I really think they could have pulled a little more feeling into this movie, Susan Sarandon is one of my favorites and they did not use her at all. Richard Gere was his usual boring self which fit quite well with the story line but he needs something/someone around him to carry the ball and add life to a story, his smile alone just doesnt do the job."
3,Moral-lessly Suspenseful,"The film keeps you on edge, but it is marked by a lack of morality.I did enjoy the movie though."
4,i liked it,"we enjoyed the movie, and the ease of ordering it, and watching it at home. we check for more movies now and then"
3,it was OK,"The plot was good - sometimes hard to follow -It was the typical rich guy cheating on his wife, which puts the whole family at risk. He thinks it couldn't happen to him!!!"
3,Arbitrage,"Nice film to watch, truly revelant to our times. Richard Gere is a great attraction. Movie buffs should really like it."
3,The pre-view oversells it,Not as exciting as it was packaged to be. I hated the ending. The preview led us to believe that it was going to be more of an action thriller. Just ok.
4,Entertaining,"Intense, thrilling drama. Gere and Sarandon give strong performances. Unfortunately, this movie didn't do well at the box office, but I thought it was well worth the $4."
2,Save your money,Boring moving I would not pay any more than a dollar for this one. Richard is was not that good
3,Arbitrage,'t Arbitrage was ok. I would not watch it again. It wasn' t Richard Gere's best. I like Richard Gere.
2,boring,Just watched a man who overextends try to get past it with more fiddling with his paperwork. He mistakenly has his daughter working for him so she gets to see how he plays the game too.
1,No script is good enough to override the never-ending FOUL LANGUAGE,"The never-ending fountain of FOUL LANGUAGE in this movie is horrible! Evidently the writers didn't have much to say, because the filler is ear piercing in nearly every other sentence or conversation in this movie. Let's pretend that these ""rich folks"" actually graduated from college, and some from many years of college ... meaning that they are well educated. I would hope that all of that education might net them a larger, more intelligent dictionary from which to speak. There is not a script in the world great enough to distract from the filthy mouths in this movie. If you prefer a cleaner dialogue, skip this one, even though it may have your favorite actors in it, it is not worth your time, money or thoughts!"
1,Arbitrage (Movie) Downer,"If you like downers, this movie will be perfect for you. I am so sorry I wasted my money. (The only up side is I did not see it at a movie theatre, where I could have wasted a lot more)."
2,This movie is a snooze and confused,"I love Gere in almost everything he has ever done, this would be my exception.I found this movie very confusing and boring. There is too much going on and too many sub-plots.Tim Roth was annoying as the dogged detective.My favorite character is the young black man, played by Nate Parker, who helps Gere; he had the only part I believed.Susan Sarandon was almost invisible; if she spoke 10 lines throughout that was a lot. And she's such a good actress.Brit Marling, playing the daughter, was an Ivanka Trump wannabe without the intelligence, beauty and sense of style and humor. Bad choice.I would be astounded if Gere got an Oscar nom for this as people who are interviewing him are all saying. He seems humble and probably knowsbest that this was no stellar performance of his.Don't waste your money, as I did."
3,not the ending I'd hoped for,long and rather drawn out. . I just didn't care for ending. better off waiting to rent or Netflix to watch.
1,disappointing. should be renamed GARBITRASH,"I normally love movies with Richard Gere. But this movie was terrible. Richard Gere played an unlikable, selfish character. in fact, there was only one likeable character in the entire movie. the ending was terrible as well. don't waste your time on this boring movie. I really want my 3.99 back :("
3,Arbitage,Not a good Richard Gere movie! Not Gere's quality of movie's! Sarandan played the part of a damaged wife when she should have recognize the man he was supposed to be!
3,It is okay,The story was a little bit predictable. I wouldn't watch the movie twice. It was okay for killing an evening.
2,"Great cast, lame plot","The cast and acting were good though didn't think Gere was at his best, but the plot, especially the ending that never was, was lame. I was disappointed in the movie especially since I had been waiting for it to come out on DVD."
1,Rehash of Bonfire of the Vanities,"A rehash of Bonfire of the Vanities, the movie droned on and on. At one point I took the dog for a walk without pausing the film. Not Richard Gere's best. The Obama campaign didn't get value from yet another attempt to demonize Wall Street."
2,Not Gere's best,Glad I didn't waste my money viewing this in a theater Plot was weak. Acting was fair. Usually I am a big RG fan but his acting was off in this film.
3,Interesting ending,I rented this movie because I heard good things about Richard Gere's performance and I am a fan. I agree that some of the movie was predicatable but the final resolution was not. Gere's performance was great as was most of the other cast members. It would have been nice to see more of Susan Sarandon but waht she does at the end makes up for her small scene time. Worth watching at least once.
4,Arbitrage,The movie was very good and as usual Richard Gere did a great job. It just shows how too much money can lead you on to a dangerous path in life. Your never satisfied and always want more and forget what the real values in life are.
4,Good Movie,"Good movie, kind of suspenseful. Being rich can cause a lot of problems in your career and personal life. The story kept you intriqued for most of the movie. Good acting."
4,wall street thriller,story about a man trying to avoid the consequences of his financial and moral shenanigans. at some level you may be pushed to cheer for the bad guy--hope he gets away with it--unless you are a law and order type.
2,"Good movie, bad ending.",The ending was terrible!! You have no idea what happened to the main characters. If the end was clsed out better I would have given 4 stars.
4,Slick Character,"In light of recent scandals, fictional Arbitrage rang true enough to hold my attention. Gere's character is very successful and oh, so slick in regards to getting away with questionable behavior, but he is not untouchable. You don't know if he will be slick enough this time to walk away from his sins or not until the end."
3,Arbitrage too convoluted,A story about a guy who is cheating on wife with a mistress and is about to go down the drain financially on a bad $400 million Wall Street venture is just too stupid.
4,Better than I thought,I was skeptial about this movie. I thought it was going to be one of those movies that all the good parts were in the trailer. It wqasn't. It was pretty good.
2,Amazon Quality great,"The movie not so much. I am a fan of Richard Gere, this movie does him no justice, (maybe I still have his performance of Mayo in Officer and a Gentlemen -which earns him 5 Stars in my book) 2 stars here Richard. See you next time."
3,Poor Directing; Lousy Acting ...,"A wonderful cast; however, they become ""pearls before swine"" in this thing termed, movie. The abc's of performing and directing just weren't observed."
3,Fair,Gere did good job but story required more depth than time allowed. Movie did not allow for character development that was needed.
4,Riveting thriller!,"Arbitrage is an engrossing film from start to finish. In spite of some character development shortcomings, particularly for some of its principal characters, the film does not fail to deliver a unique resolution to a familiar set of circumstances. I would recommend this movie wholeheartedly."
3,What kind of an ending was that???,"It was an ok movie, but the ending sucked.I usually really like Richard Greer movies, I was kinda disappointed with this one, especially that ending!"
4,Exciting with suspense!,"Great corporate film, love and suspense! I like it because of Richard Gere starring in it. Love all his movies, good or bad, I like them"
4,Excellent Movie,"I think Richard Gere was born to play a wealthy executive. He's amazing in this role! Interesting all the way through.I gave it only four stars though because of the ending. It was as if they ran out of time or budget and just decidedto end it right there. Was not a good ending at all, but the acting and rest of the movie kept me very entertained."
3,The ending was weak,"I felt the movie was unfinished. It ended rather abruptly....It had a beginning, a middle, but no end. I was looking forward to seeing a consequence for Gere's character, but the movie ended leaving the viewer to conclude what happened."
3,Slow but Tense Burner,"""Arbitrage"" has enough tension and intrigue to carry you through even its rather draggy middle portions. It's a pretty decent corporate thriller that convincingly shows the inner workings of a big New York investment firm. It has its share of surprises and skillfully makes use of subtle details (ex: the license plate photos). Nevertheless, it lacks the climactic punch it seems to promise. When the credits started rolling, I thought ""Huh? That's IT?!""It's not Gere's finest performance: his character's a bit wooden at times. Still, though I don't generally like billionaire CEO types who cheat on their wives, the storyline and script made me care what happened to him even though a big part of me didn't particularly want to care. Some really fine acting by most of the supporting cast, particularly Susan Sarandon and the various guys who play Miller (Gere)'s corporate cronies and rivals."
2,Terrible ending.,The movie keeps you watching then leaves you hanging in the end. My wife said to make up my own ending and I told her I don't watch a movie to make up my own ending.
3,SOS ...,Rule number one is you have to care about the characters in the story. I didn't.Same old same old.
2,Very disappointed,"The movie had two good actors, but a very B- script. I think too much was left on the cutting room floor, so it was choppy and piece meal. Poorly done."
3,An average thriller,"Well acted and tuned to feed the zeitgeist of anti-Wall Street attitudes, this movie seemed to provide a relatively predictable story-line with a slight twist in the end.Where it shines most, though, is in its ability to show you a list of unlikable characters and lets you figure out which one you dislike least. The story line is one of how the rich get away with anything (almost) and can sit above the law.Entertaining? A bit. Worth the price? not sure."
2,Disappointing,"I love Richard gere. Would watch almost anything of his. But this movie was slow, disappointing. Poor character development. I couldn't care less about any of the characters.I was glad when it was over"
3,Arbitrage was just okay,"I was delighted to watch this new theatre release at the comfort of my home. My expectation of the movie was much higher...the movie is just okay, and I am happy that I did not pay for it full price at the theatre."
4,"smart movie, understated",Richard Gere was great and the story line strong (if not predictable). But Susan Sarandon was under utilized as the financial mogul's wife.
3,good movie-not so good ending,I enjoyed the movie but I did not care for the ending; it seemed incomplete and left me wanting more.
3,expecting more,"review made on the blu ray version of the movie.movie - 3.5 / 5video - 4.5 / 5audio - 4.5 /5movie to me was just ok, expected more to it, maybe i need to watch it again. blu ray video and audio was very good.must be getting tired of seeing richard gere act,just seems that his facial expressions in all of his movies are the same.better off as a rental."
2,A little too surreal,"I was taken in by the title-and to that end-the movie did deliver and I am ok with the fact that I bought and watched the entire movie. I say that because Gere was[good in his role] a mess trying to cover up his lies about where he was taking money from and where he was putting it""arbitrage"" at its best...the audit...the buy out-all very good. What I did not enjoy and the reason for the low rating were the three ""boring factors"" : the daugther, the lover and the end....it was kind of 'pushed' into the film and that part of the story line simply did not flow. For her(daughter) to be in her 20's and not get how the world works was silly, the fact that he walked away from a burning car with a young dead girl in itand then simply ended up at a fund raiser at the end?? Just a litte ""TOO"" surreal for me"
2,Overall review for Arbitrage streaming,"The movie was great. The service provided by Amazon was not great. My computer froze once (requiring a total reboot), every time I paused there were issues with the sound and even though I had proper credit on my account I still got charged! As a result, I have cancelled my prime subscription!"
4,"Interesting plot, involving action.",This is one of those movies which gets yo into the action and plot making you wonder how it is going to end. The end comes with surprise so it is double fun to watch it with your family.
2,Bad Movie,I was very disappointed by this movie. I streamed it at a higher price because I heard it had good reviews. Stupid ending and not worth watching
1,Would not recommend,I would not recommend this movie to anyone. This was another movie that wanted to make a statement that was lost.
2,"Not that great,but Richard Gere is always great to look at.",Same as above. Getting it to my Tivo took too long to do it again. 6+ hours. Maybe it just doesn't work to tivo?
4,Well-done family and financial drama,"Acting is excellent and the storyline keeos you interested, especially with parallels to relatviely recent news stories. Not a must see, but a pleasant and entertaining way to spend 2 hours."
3,All you would expect from Richard Gere,"Drama about a powerful ""Weasle"" of a man, yet through the whole movie you find yourself ""pulling"" for him, crazy!"
3,Good thriller with a weak ending,Okay to Good movie. Probably could be in the free section. Not sure it was worth the price of admission.
3,Fell asleep during the show,"I saw the first 20 minutes and fell asleep during the show. So therefore, feel unqualified to review the entire show. First 20 minutes were OK"
3,Richard Gere,"I will always watch any movie that includes Richard Gere. However, the most I can say for this movie is that it included Richard Gere. Slow...........................or maybe I was just missing something. My husband felt the same way. Anyway, I may watch it again someday...when IT IS FREE!"
2,Just OK,Not my favorite at all. Usually I like Richard Gere movies. Not sure about how I felt about the ending!
2,Not a good movie,"I get it, we're supposed to dislike everybody in the film, and, by the end, sure enough, we do. Just wish it were a better, more coherent story..."
4,Arbitrage [HD],"Good movie! Really enjoyed it, particularly because it was available prior to the theatrical release of the movie. Worth seeing!"
3,Arbitrage,"First 45 minutes are too slow for my taste, second part of the movie was okay, but the end did not bring any ending to it..."
3,A little hard to follow,"It was an ok movie, but all you need to know is in the trailer and previews. Probably would never consider watching again."
3,"Entertaining movie, good cast.","Better than I expected, since I had heard a negative review from a friend. But if you like Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon and you're in the mood for some moderate suspense, you might enjoy this movie. The plot moves forward, maybe too slowly for some tastes, but all in all, not bad."
2,Disappointing,"Arbitrage was slow moving and it was hard to stay focused on this drama. When it finally picked up the pace, the ending was very disappointing."
3,"Great acting, pretty good script, bad ending","Great acting, pretty good script, bad endingGreat acting, pretty good script, bad endingGreat acting, pretty good script, bad ending"
3,Richard Gere makes a full-on effort,But the writing and plot is a little weak. Susan Sarandan is completely underutilized. Just a ho-hum movie at best.
3,Good for rental,Kept my interest but seemed very unrealistic. Acting was good but hard to believe. Richard Gere makes it worthwhile. Perfect rental but wouldn't pay theater price.
3,"Lots of style, not much substance","When I read the synopsis for this movie, I was excited to see it. (And no, unlike most Amazon reviewers, I am NOT going to provide you the 100th detailed recap of the plot -- you already know what it's about).Instead, I'm going to give you my reaction to the movie, which is ""fairly disappointed"". There's just not much substance here and the ending is particularly unsatisfying. Oh well, I'm glad I didn't waste the money to see this at the movie theater."
3,"Two weeks later, I have no real impression for this.","At best, it is OK. But nothing special. The plot is rather trite in these times of bashing Wall Street. The story was somewhat compelling but there were no surprises here."
3,Hated the ended,Good movies have a tendency to ruin a great viewing experience with a bad ending. I really enjoyed the movie Richard Gere is always great to watch but I was expecting more at the end.
3,Almost great,90-95% of this movie was good... but then it just ends abruptly. Beware that the story doesn't totally get wrapped up in the end.
4,Wonderful ......,WOW the ten min View.....was wonderful it keeps you on your toes....I do plan to order and will tell my family its a movie they must see..
3,"Been There, Done That","Not particularly well-acted by any of the major characters. Not enough suspense to make you even care how it ends. Ultimately, illegal, boorish behavior pays off in the end."
4,Hard to believe the truth...,"Shades of Bernie Madoff, though this time the culprit gets away with it. If anywhere near the truth it comfirms my deepest fears about our financial system and the ability of the wealthly to ""circumvent"" the system, hide their misdeeds (leaving the little guys to pay the bill). Well acted and interesting enough to keep my limited attention span in place, kudos to ""Ellen"" for her twist at the end, at least someone benefitted from this scam!!"
4,Good movie,We haven't watched a good suspense movie in quite some time and this one was a pleasant surprise. Of course I am a fan of Richard Gere. I think using Susan Sarandon as his wife was not a good choice -- she is a talented actress but just didn't fit the bill in this movie.
3,Ok way to pass 2 hours,"The movie was ok with some intrigue but seemed to lose direction part way through. Some of the secondary storylines could have been better developed. Overall, it was evident why it was available to rent before it left the theaters."
2,Poor Ending,Good begginning and start of the story but a really bad ending with no conclusion or redemption to speak of.
4,ARBITRAGE......,"THE MOVIE WAS VERY GOOD AND KEPT YOU ON THE EDGE OF OUR SEATS, BUT THERE WAS TOO MUCH INAPROPRIATE LANGUAGE ESPECIALLY F... Y.. WE DO LIKE RICHARD GERE IN ALL HIS MOVIES..."
2,Not their best.,Biased on the better works by the actors in this film it was a disappointment. The plot and story line was not bad but the ending was less than good and left you wondering what could have happened. I would love to have my money back on this one.
3,Keeping up with Jone's,"It just ok movie. At least Gere was good in it and if he is up for a academy award for this movie. I can tell people I saw it and his performance. It shows a somewhat idea that people today only really care about themselves and all others are just pawns to keep them entertain. Not really trying to be rightous either. Susan Sarandon could have been given better role. Story could have been developed better. But Richard was good in it for the part he played. It was better than seeing little kids killed in a sci fi movie not to be named. Which has a big name star in it. Also for those who said its boring, might be but better than seeing endless unreality shootings and things blowing up. So a decent try at something other than shooting of big guns."
3,DVD OK; movie disappointing.,The end of the movie seemed to leave the viewer hanging! One did not know how or why Richard Gere made the deal that he did. Was it because of his wife or his new buyer?
4,good story,"Gere does a fine job...story is somewhat predictable...but well done...n icely paced, well acted by everyone, and there is no justice in the end...satisfies our most cynical selves...."
3,its all richard,Richard played his usual character cool and under control under very stressful situations. If you a Richard Gere fan you will enjoy this movie. The movie itself did not flow well maybe due to editing or poor writing. This could have been a much better movie but it was still worth watching.
3,Was not bad,The story kept me watching. But it reminded me a bit too much of the reality of the corruption of these billionaire businesses. At least in this story he cared about the investors.
3,Move OK if you like Financial movies,"I generally likes these types of movies but it was on the boring side. It is one of those movies you say: ""OK rental but worth going to the theater"""
2,What a Big Disappointment It Was,The acting was excellent! The plot sucked! The plot never pulled me in or put me on the edge of my seat at all. I feel they could have gone so much deeper in with more twist and turns for the plot. Actors can only work with what they are given and so it was very disappointing so don't bother.
3,It is ok.,I am a big Richard Gere fan but this movie was boring. I really don't even remember much about it.
4,Greed!,It's sad when people have so much and is never enough.This is story of the lengths people will go to get it!
2,Junk Bond,"Very shallow plot, it read like Bernie Madoff from the beginning and then the ending was very anti-climatic. Probably the worst movie I've seen in the past three years."
2,Formula Drama,"By the book formula drama, with premise and plot the very current topic of financial and personal corruption by the ultra wealthy. No real surprises found here."
2,horrible ending,I thought the movie had a good plot n was just getting really good n than it ends n Ur left hanging and just because of that I would n v watch this movie again..
4,A classic for me,"I remember seeing this for the first time when I was around 11 or 12 and it scared the beejesus out of me. My cousins and I threw blankets on the floor and had a sleepover watching it. Needless to say we didn't get much sleep. Now it's 20+ years later and it still scares me a bit :) A bit cheesy, of course, but the cheesiness makes it all the more fun to watch. When the dead girl's ""shadow"" is seen in the music room, I get chills every time! I love this movie."
1,No subtitles,"Just a warning to those looking at the product specs: the Amazon description says this film is subtitled, but it is not. There are no subtitles (English, or any other language) available on this DVD. It is in Spanish (the original language), and I don't speak Spanish, so I guess I'm out of luck. Wish the product description had been more accurate."
1,This is not 5W50,"If you are interested in 5W50 do not buy this product. They will send you Hitachi 19210 which is 10W30. This oil has totally different parameters then 5W50. I called them couple of weeks ago letting them know about the mix-up and they told me this is the only oil they have and still keep the same description of the product. I guess the company has an overstock of 10W30 and just wants to sell it. They do not care that it can damage your compressor.One good thing about it is that they did not mind accepting the product back. Just remember to request the return lable for the shipment. Money for the product was refunded, but the cost of initial shipment was not (and in my case it was almost $10). It was them who sent the wrong product, so they should refound my entire costs, not only for the product."
3,Hitachi compressor oil,i bought 2 tubes og this and found it its false advertizing its not the B model its the really old standard number.the viscosity is probably all broken down by now and will burn out my compressor.dont trust this guy i think it was LLc enterprises or similar.buy from ebay at least i get protection from these bums that selll junk but not here.
3,The Migraine Ice gives a wonderfully cooling sensation ...,"The Migraine Ice gives a wonderfully cooling sensation when you first put it on your forehead. It's much easier to use than the masks that cover your eyes. I can put this on and lie down and read for a few minutes (to help me relax) and then close my eyes and rest. I can also use this while I am doing other things like making dinner, etc. to help me cope with a headache until I can rest."
5,Super nice,This Zippo is a perfect compliment to the regular size Black Matte lighter with red border. The thin size and finish will keep fingerprints away and is an ideal weight. The white zippo logo adds the finishing touch to a perfectly created American product.
5,Great stuff!,"I have very fair cancer prone skin and live in Florida. I put it on right after my shower every day and spend a lot of time outdoors in the Florida sun, I never burn, and haven't had anymore skin Ca. it looks great and dries in a heartbeat, and smells good too.I can't live without it."
4,Great CD!!,I love this first cd by The Crash Test Dummies! I especially love The Supeman's song. This cd is worth picking up!!
3,"A simple, unobtrusive debut","When I first got this album, I was immediately struck by its laid-back style. It isn't great, but it isn't terrible, either. The band definitely staked out its style well here -- folk-style pop, but still too folky to be anything near top-40 material. (Why the Dummies chose the dreary ""Superman's Song"" as their single is beyond me; it's among the least accessible songs on the album.) ""Coming Back Soon,"" a wonderfully wry tale of love, is undoubtedly this album's highlight, and the wide-eyed whimsy of ""The Voyage"" is fun, too. Other than that, the songs do tend to run into one another. Probably best for CTD fans only."
5,The First and Finest,"While I love the Dummies' subsequent and highly-stylized forrays into the tangled human psyche, Ghost is by far the most clever and most fun. The dreariness of the subjects is mitigated by the warm, open jangle of accoustic guitar, mandolin and banjo, sassy organ riffs and a happy little penny whistle. If these are ghost stories (and they certainly are!), they're being told in a treehouse by your favorite eccentric grandpa. This is a must-have for fans and newbies alike."
2,2.5 stars,"Known by many non-hard core fans as 'the other CTD album', ""The Ghosts That Haunt Me"" gives listeners at the time a slice of the unusual CTD sound that was perfected later with the amazing ""God Shuffled His Feet"" release. ""Ghosts..."" starts out very promising with the up-tempo number ""Winter Song"" that boldly announces that this band's sound is really non-mainstream, a very good sign, but subsequent cuts steadily drag the album down with melody that just doesn't seem to hit its mark. ""Superman's Song"" ultimatly is the best cut on the album and a fine cut it is indeed. Production values are fine leaning a bit more 'violiny' and 'harmonica-y' than the later ""God..."" effort, which was given a more streamlined bottom heavy production. Overall it was a fine effort for the band, but pales in comparison to their next release."
3,Why Tarzan?,"I like ""Superman's Song."" It's a touching tribute to the Last Son of Krypton and the World's Greatest Hero, but why is Tarzan treated so poorly? John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, is truly getting the short end of the Crash Test Dummies' stick here. Tarzan was not illiterate, lazy, or poor with women. Have you ever seen Jane Porter? 38-24-36 according to P.J. Farmer's seminal ""Tarzan Alive."" The Lord of the Apes is one of fiction's greatest heroes, but sadly, his legacy is pervaded by the string of monosyllabic portrayals in film. And, it appears that CTD fell victim to that, as well. Hey, guys, pick up ""Tarzan of the Apes"" by E.R. Burroughs and learn a little. But, hey, ""Superman's Song"" is still a great song."
4,Pretty Good Band,"I just finished listening to ""The Crash Test Dummies"" C.D. ""The Ghosts That Haunt Me"" and I thought it was pretty good. If you are in the mood for some relaxing evening music than this is the C.D. to have. My favourite song on this C.D. has to be Superman's Song. Although the C.D. is slightly short, it is still a keeper."
4,Superman's Song,"Weirdly brilliant song was the reason I bought this disk (""Supe had a straight job, even though he coulda smashed into any bank in the United States."" So true.) The rest of the disk is pleasant enough."
3,Dummies For Beginners,"I first heard the Crash Test Dummies on a Christmas album calledA Lump of Coal. Their rendition of ""The First Noel"" was the best thing on that album, and it intrigued me enough to buy their first album. It is a pretty good album, with two great songs, ""Superman's Song"" and ""At the Funeral"". The rest of the songs range from okay to good. The band has a really original sound, and many people will probably like this CD."
5,TOUCHING and REAL,"Steve Roberts has written a charming memoir that celebrates his family and an era gone by. Roberts grew up in Jersey City, an area usually reserved for punch-lines of stupid jokes, but Roberts captures all that is to be valued in his hometown. It is refreshing to read a memoir that is not so much motivated by anger and discontent. MY FATHER'S HOUSES is a memoir written to give credit where it is due."
2,Gone,"This movie was very slow and boring for me.The character Alex was very creepy,and you could tell he was some sort of social path,but his character was hard to figure out.A few times I thought the movie was about to take of and we really begin to see some things about Alex,but then it would go back to being slow and boring.I love a action packed movie that has a plot that builds and keeps you guessing,and all I wasnted to was for this movie to hurry up and get to the end.This is one movie I wish I had not rented."
4,Handy dandy!,"Ideal for key management. In my business I have multiple sets of keys for cars and numerous businesses, this easy to use cabinet keeps them safe and organized. Set-up is simple and it comes with everything needed for labelling. However, the tiny key rings provided aren't adequate for larger keys, like chip car keys."
5,Recommended for Everyone,We had a smaller key cabinet but when we needed to upgrade I found this one. This is totally awesome. No need for a key to get inside and the organization makes is so much easier. It's a busy office so I would definitely recommend this for anyone using multiple keys.
2,okay organization cabinet.,"the cabinet is constructed decently, the lock mechanism is prone to failure and seems like a poor quality lock. better than leaving your keys lying on the counter, but i would rather have something with a better lock."
4,Feeled our needs!,For the money this item worked well! It was not the highest of qualty but suited our needs just fine.
3,Mother bereavement,"I may have misread the description, but thought the item was a frame. It turns out it was only a matte-finished poem and picture holder that required a frame to finish the product. Fortunately, I had the item sent directly to me so I was able to finish it off with a frame. I would have been embarassed if I had it sent directly the recipient of the gift in this unfinished format.I would suggest making it very clear that the items requires a frame."
5,FAMOUS SHOW ALL OVER THE WORLD,"Also in Germany a very famous show. Here under the title: Lieber Onkel Bill that might be in English: ""DEAREST UNCLE BILL"". Unfortunately we got just 25 % of all seasons. Now on DVD it's a wonderful experience to have a rendevous with the past.Every show with a happy ending. Can't wait for the other seasons."
4,"Great Memories, however...","These are perfect memories and a great addition to my ""oldies"" collection! The shows are of great quality and Keith and Cabot were such a great team! I had to give the DVDs a 4 star rating because there is no scene skipping, therefore if you need to stop or accidently hit the wrong control, one must start from the beginning of the show and fast forward all the way to where you left off. Quite annoying! Sometimes it can take up to 15 minutes to get to the spot you want to be.Otherwise, excellent family viewing!"
5,Some shows never get old!,"I purchased this item for my 6 year old twins (Boy/Girl), who have been referred to numerous times as ""Jody and Buffy"". Not understanding why, I begain my search on TNT, TVLand and other cable networks for the show for them; No Luck. The 5 DVD set was a Christmas hit, with the kids actually calling themselves Jody and Buffy! Great family entertainment for all ages. May have to get ready for some unique questions (Why do all the men where hats?, Why does Uncle Bill smoke all the time, etc)"
5,A true family classic!,"If you like good, clean, wholesome shows, you will love this set! The shows are 1/2 an hour in length, so they were perfect for me to watch before bed to unwind and clear my head. They aren't violent or abusive, nor do they use language that is objectionable. It's just a sweet show that I grew up watching as a child."
5,A sitcom with true warmth and charm.,"In contrast to the often low grade vulgarity represented in todays sitcoms, Family Affair displayed ""family values"" in their truest sense. I hope for the release of the entire series!"
3,Made A Great Gift,"My wife bought this set for her sister because she grew up watching the series. As far as we know, she loves it. I only gave it 3 stars because I didn't look at the actual DVDs."
5,Musical pleasure,One of the best performances of the Bulgarian classical music which I've ever heard. Amazing sound and deep understanding of the specific of the performed violin pieces. Excellent technique and artistry.
2,Not For Novices,"OK. I bought the book, Linux Toys, for one reason and one reason only: Chapter 15 - Digital Picture Frame. There is just not enough info in the book for neophites such as myself. The website: www/linuxtoys.com does not help either."
1,Boo,"Thought I would enjoy this since I love JFK AND Patrick Dempsy. I was wrong. It was boring. Yeah...it followed pretty closely with the truth...but it just seemed pointless,boring, and plot challenged."
1,Only 1/2 the Mini-Series!,"Previous reviewer is correct, this release contains only the second half of the mini-series. The box clearly states 183 minutes, yet the one disc contains only 91. It should have been a two disc set. Someone at MPI really blew it on this one. The film film itself is not bad..."
1,Only Half The Story,"This much delayed release of the 1992 mini-series is one that I hade long awaited. However, my expectations have turned to dismay as the disc appears only to contain the second half of the show.Despite the packaging and disc listing a running time of 180 minutes, my copy, purchased in Cambridge, Mass, runs for merely 91 minutes.Inquiries to the manufacturer have proven to be less than helpful, and I am therefore unable to recommend a purchase of what should have been a welcome addition to the DVD market for this title.I look forward to the rectification of this over-sight by the disc manufacturer, but fear that it may be a long time coming."
5,The DVD is now the complete movie - it's been corrected,"I bought the DVD when it first came out and just got around to watching it (it IS 3 hours, and I'd seen it when it originally aired), and discovered I had a defective DVD. Thanks to reading the below comments, I knew it was a manufacturer's error and contacted the manufacturer's customer service, asking if the problem had been corrected and, if so, would they exchange it. Within the hour, they sent me an email requesting an address to replace the disc. I've just watched the new and improved DVD, so buy with confidence! (And the movie is really well done.)"
3,Factually Incorrect,"It was entertaining generally, but factually incorrect in that it depicted JFK as having left the US Navy with the rank offull lieutennant (O3) when in actuality he was a LTjg (junior grade) (O2) upon leaving the Naval Service."
4,Biblical Blocks,"The instructions for block construction in this book are very good. This could be a very complicated quilt to make, and Rosemary has made it easy. Our new quilt group at church did this as a first project. Except for two of us, all were first time quilters. They were all able to cut and assemble blocks at home with ease. We chose other fabrics than what Rosemary suggests and the quilts turned out beautiful!"
5,Amazing Marinade,I have been using this marinade on skirt steak for the past year and it is amazing. Recommend to all.
3,Hot!,"This stuff is HOT!! I was expecting a bold flavor, not 'set your mouth on fire so you can feel it an hour later'. We made pork chops using this. I had to wash them off so the kids could eat them... which kind of defeats the point in using a marinade. If you like hot, then go for it. Not what I was expecting."
5,Just Right!,"If you're looking for something to put you into the Christmas mood, this is a wonderful CD to help you out. Barry Manilow is an amazing musician. He sings, he writes, he arranges, he does it all. He even updates some of the old Bing Crosby/Andrews Sisters Christmas classics with 90's girl group Expose. The songs flow seamlessly from one to the next making this CD more of an ""experience"" as opposed to just a bunch of songs thrown together.There was a companion video that came out when this CD was first released. If you're a Manilow fan (and you can find it), I recommend it. Watching Barry sing ""Everybody knows a turkey (pause)"" is really pretty funny!"
5,loved by niece,"this was a christmas present for my niece, who is an ardent fan of manilow .... she loved the cd"
2,Way too mellow- not in a good way,"If you like your Christmas carols slow and dirge-like, this album is for you. I prefer something upbeat myself. Love Barry, didn't like this."
5,My favorite Christmas CD,"I love Christmas music and have many cds. I have all of Barry's Christmas cds. This is by far, my favorite Christmas cd in all my big collection. ""Baby it's Cold Outside"" is the BEST arrangement and vocal I've ever heard on this song. I love all the Christmas music between songs. ""Because It's Christmas"" makes me tear up everytime I hear it. Carol of the Bells, even tho it's an excerpt is so pretty. I wish that he had included Ava Maria on this. He does it on another cd and I love his voice on it-while not operetic perfect, it's just beautiful. I have 3 of these and have also given some to friends as gifts and they love them too."
5,Charming for Fanilows!,"If you love Barry, you'll love this album. If not, you probably shouldn't bother. Full of charming Christmas music, arranged with the Manilow touch."
5,I'm Heartbroken,"This is a fab album. I bought this beauty when it was new. Beautifully recorded and performed, this album does not belong in the budget rack. This platinum recording should go out of print instead of the status it now holds. If this album (cd) is available at the nearest grocery, it'll be the best six bucks you've ever spent. What a tragedy."
3,This Christmas album is OK.,"This Christmas album by Barry Mannilow is OK, but not great. I got it principally because I love the ""Baby, its cold outside"" song on it."
3,Barry Manilow,This was an ok CD for me but I have better ones recorded earlier in his career. I am a great fan but I also like to be honest...
3,Mixed bag,"By this point in his career he had two distinct music personalities: the soft & sappy and the blue & jazzy. His blue & jazzy numbers, particularly ""I guess there ain't no Santa Claus"" and his rendition of ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" are untouchable, 5-star classics. The other side, represented by ""Christmas is for the children"" is cringe-inducing.Now it's 2006 and I have not heard his last Christmas outing, but I have one question. What the Holy Heck did he do to his face???????????-Mark"
2,Because it IS Christmas!!,"I'm a long-time fan of Barry Manilow and was delighted to receive this CD as a gift. That is, until I listened to it! I think it's one of the worst Christmas albums I've ever had. Because, you see, it IS Christmas and I want to hear about Christmas. Many of the songs gave just a brief instrumental intro (Silent Night, The First Noel, Joy to the World, Carol of the Bells, We Wish you a Merry Christmas) and then went to his singing something else like When the Meadow was Blooming (Huh?????) or It's Just Another New Year's Eve.The only redeeming portion is the one track when he sings an excerpt from Handel's Messiah. I would have loved an entire CD of his singing portions of the Messiah."
1,Garbage,"I am a deadhead, but hated this cd. The only good thing about it was that there are lyrics to the songs. Some of the artists that are on this cd are not deadheads & only did a rendition because they wanted to get press.I do not recommend anyone buy this for any reason. Get the real stuff."
3,"Hurt by morning, but great at blocking sound","I sleep much better with these in, since they really block out the noise. But in the morning, my ear canals feel inflamed from the pressure of the expanded foam."
3,This product was great -- except they're very ...,"This product was great -- except they're very large, so they stuck out of my ears and looked silly. They'd be fine under a helmet or in bed at night. They're very good at keeping the noise level low!"
5,Flents Foam Ear Plugs,"I have used these ear plugs for years. They are the best!!! My husband snores and these take care of the problem as far as I'm concerned! I hate the wax or silicon plugs, these are by far the most comfortable and effective that I've tried."
1,Useless,The plugs do not help at all. You hear the noise as if there are no plugs. Although they pretty comfortable albeit useless.
1,Terrible,Very bad I can't put them in my ear and if I do they fall out and if they don't fall out I hear everything like I woul without them
2,two stars only,"Only reason I gave these two stars is because I got them so cheap and they last for a time. Overall, I find that these ear plugs simply do not last nearly as long as virtually any other ear plug I've used. I might use them for a week and they're shot. The comfort level is good but they quickly get deformed. If I had my choice, I used to use these 3m ear plugs and a set of those would last nearly two months. But I have a hard time finding those anymore. *sigh"
1,Not a good product.,"I purchased this item, got it home, placed brand new batteries in it, and turned it on and nothing. You could barely see the lights going around and barely hear the music if it was playing any at all. I returned this item. I went into babiesrus the other day and passed by this mirror on the shelf and decided to give it a try in the store to see if maybe it was just my purchase that was defective but the same happened in the store. Not a good product."
5,LOVE IT,"I love this mirror. It is big and gives you good , clear view of your baby.Plus she/ he had good entertainment."
4,Great distraction for easily bored baby!,"I originally purchased this as a way to keep an eye on my daughter, since she was in the back seat of our van. It turned out to be a sanity saving device . We live by train tracks, and the music and lights help to distract her while we wait. I will say, though, that the cold weather zapped the batteries, so maybe re-chargeables are in order for this toy. My toddler also loves it. He uses the remote to turn it on and off, which in itself entertains his sister."
2,Battery eater,"This has been more trouble than it is worth, due to constantly replacing batteries...it is always dead when I need to entertain the baby :("
3,Lots of fun but probably not best video in series,"I love masala bhangra. It's a great workout and it's a LOT of fun. I take classes in person at my gym and thought doing the workout at home would be a good way to improve my skills.However, if I were not familiar w/these moves because of my gym class, I would have a hard time just keeping up with the video. This one does not slow down to demonstrate the moves clearly enough for a beginner. Maybe it's okay to just wing it and try to keep up; maybe you'll get it eventually... but I could use a little clearer instruction.Beyond that, it's a fun and exhilarating workout!Back 2 Bollywood (Full)"
5,Love the video!!!!!,"I love the video, I danced ""traditional"" styles for 14+ years and recently fell in love with Indian dancing! I found other instructors that I liked then ran across Sarina Jain's video! I'm thankful I took a chance and got the video! It isn't like the other videos where I get bored after 2 times watching it! You can actually dance, I love the fact that unlike other videos she puts the steps together and all the ""block"" together at the end! You can make it as easy or as challenging as you want depending on your level of fitness. You do need to be able to catch onto dance moves quite quick but is so worth it if you can't it's a GREAT FUN workout!! I laugh and love it, I'm smiling through the whole workout!! And even on those days I don't' want to workout, I'm glad I did it!!! I just ordered two more of her videos and can't wait until they come in..... She is also coming into my state not to far so I plan on taking the class and can't wait!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Forfex By Babyliss Pro Fx789w Professional Cord/cordless Trimmer With Charging Stand,"[ASIN:B001UHN0K4 FORFEX by Babyliss PRO FX789W Professional Cord/Cordless Trimmer]]I had this Forfex FX789w and now i destroy it.It's very weak trimmer,the battery need to charge 24 hours for you to use it and the battery work only 20min and then it died.This is Very bad trimmer.Do not buy it.....!"
5,Fantastic,"This album is truly fantastic. The only reason this band does not have world domination is because they have chosen to sing in their native language of French. All the songs have rap mixed with elements of their Breton roots. All the songs have great lyrics and even better tunes, so even if you aren't a French speaker you can still appretiate the fine musical quality and their excellent singing voices. This album is a must in anyone's collection."
5,Excellent,"Generally speaking, rap has been something that I have strongly disliked... Until a friend let me listen to this CD by Manau. Absolutely marvelous... Good music (I didn't believe my friend when he told me that the music was great, and have since apologised to him :-) ) and beautiful lyrics. Your enjoyment of this CD will be enhanced if you are able to understand French; you will then find out the unexpected depth and beauty of the lyrics. I strongly recommend the tracks ""La Tribu de Dana"", ""L'avenir est un long passé"", ""Le chien du forgeron"" and ""La confession""."
3,French Rap with a celtic twist,The first thing you should know about this CD is that it is in French. So if you don't speak French this might be a problem. But the bottom line is that this CD sounds great anyway. I love the way the rap has been integrated with that funky Breton flute. I don't really know or care what they are saying. I can understand why French people are so excited by this CD since it can be hard to find good music in French.
1,not ready for prime time,"this thing caused me mnore grief than almost all my ex girlfriends put together (almost). it is unbelievably sensitive during installation, and awkward in the extreme to use for capturing full length movies to disk. i guess you could use for capturing home movies to disk, but there are much better products available for that. also, you can't return it without talking to tech support first, but of course they don't answer email or phone calls. in the end i cancelled payment for the (...). good one creative, keep it up and you will be joining osbourne and kaypro in computer valhalla."
1,Not working .. Not compatible :(,Not compatible with WindowsXP.Not really compatible with Windows 2000.No documentationNo online information
1,Terrible product. Stay away!,"I bought this product after reading a good review in the local newspaper plus Creative Labs is a reputable company. My intention was to convert my home VHS videos into VCD. It was a costly mistake. The driver is not really supported by Windows OS. It will only work with the bundled software (Ulead) which has been customized for this product and nothing else. Recording quality is poor. When I did long recordings, the video and voice was out of sync! Terrible product. Stay away!"
5,my dog loved it :),"My dog had this as a first toy and she absolutely loved it. She would take it everywhere with her. When it needed, I had to restuff it with the stuffing and perform ""surgery"" cuz I bought a new one, but she wouldn't take to it - she kept going for the old one. In 6 years I performed this ""stuffing surgery"" twice -- which in my opinion makes it pretty durable since it was chomped on daily. My dog unfortunately passed away young, and I still have her little hartz squeaker next to her collar to remind me of her. :"")"
1,Flimsy,"This toy arrived dirty and did not have the tag. The canvas was flimsy (with a hole where the tag used to be) and the stitching was poor. My dog had the stuffing out after a two fetches, so she LOVED it. I positively hated it."
5,The best,"It's hard to get excited about a pool pump motor, but this one is exactly as others described. After many years of cringing when the Polaris' motor came on due to the noise level , I'm excited to say this one truly is quieter than the filter motor!"
4,Did Dulfer's SEX limit her SAX appeal???,"Dave Koz. David Sanborn. Grover Washington. David Benoit. Kenny G. All names that are recognizable in the world of smooth jazz. Yet, where is Dulfer???This 1991 release, featuring the hit ""Lily was Here,"" is comparable to anything released by the aforementioned gentlemen, with Dulfer showing her skills on scorchingly fast tunes to mid-tempo ""saxual"" seductive numbers to downright funky stuff.Highlights include the title cut, ""Jazzid,"" ""Donja,"" ""There Goes the Neighbourhood,"" ""Mr. Lee,"" and ""Home in Not a House.""But, why doesn't Dulfer get the ""props"" reserved for her masculine competition???It's too bad that it appears the male-dominated ranks of saxophone players doesn't seem to have enough room for one deserving female!!!"
2,Saxuality,Not they type of jazz I thought it would be. I should have reviewed each song before ordering it.
3,Sugar-Free,"Candy Dulfer could have released this album as a single with a couple of songs on the B-side. ""Lily Was Here"" is the best song on here. The rest of the album is average. Don't get me wrong, I like putting this on every once and awhile as decent background music, but I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends without first telling them to listen to it at the store first. Candy's style is not to my liking, but my wife love's this album. If for no other reason, buy this album to listen to something different. You won't here this stuff on the radio, and Dulfer is definitely more talented than this recording would lead you to think."
2,BUNCH OF (garbage),"Sorry! Last year in Ft.Myers we went through the Mall shopping for music. I picked the BONEY JAMES CD I was looking for but my friend pulled me over to CANDY DULFER who he only knew as a performer of LILY WAS HERE. We couldn't listen to the music there but I trusted my friends advice (we never went wrong before) and I got the album plus a second one WHAT DOES IT TAKE, her 1999 album (which is even worse!). There are only two other songs I like: SO WHAT and DONJA, the rest I would wipe off the CD if I could. I speak Dutch but I can't understand what she's telling us.SO WHAT! I will give it as a present to my worst enemy..."
4,Split Between Awed and Puzzled,"Candy has songs of sheer brilliance on this CD but then there are songs that seem way beneath her talents. The brilliant moments are worth the cost of the CD but the other songs are not worth listening to. I skip them,and that is something I rarely do."
3,Poor Quality,"This is a hard album to find, and if you do find it, it's pricy, as it's been long out of production. This MP3 download sounded very flat. Plenty lows and mids, but not much crispness to the highs."
2,price is right but nothing else,has no auto shut offhas no on indicator lightdose work but the risk of overcharging is very realpay a little more and get a better charger
1,Dead!,"Some people might not like my review, I go straight to the point!I purchase this unit late in 2008, within a year schumacher replaced my unit. Few weeks ago, again its dead. I will NEVER EVER AGAIN buy this product, the problem is not because its made in China or not, the problem is their electrical engineer doing a bad job and the selection of CHEAP components.It did work well but such a unit should last a lot longuer than a year!"
2,"Good workout, defective DVD",This workout is pretty good. The problem is that the DVD stops in the middle of the workout and so its usefulness is really limited. I see from at least one other review that the reviewer had the same problem. She exchanged the defective DVD for a new one. It had exactly the same defect...stopped at exactly the same spot. The DVD is not returnable and I am reluctant to order a replacement. Bummer and really annoying.
5,Exercise,Absolutely love this video. Had been doing another walking DVD and needed a variety and a boost to my workout and this video did just that. You will really get a nice workout.
3,shapley girl,"I was really looking forward to this dvd as an alternative to Leslie. I did like some of her moves but the overall was a little slow. The dvd production leaves a lot to be desired. Instead of doing each segment, the dvd was looped. I guess that was used to make the production cheaper. The best part was the ab section."
4,Love Debra!,"Lots of options on this video. You can make it shorter/longer as you like. Debra is fun and her raft of ""regular"" women working out is refreshing."
3,Good for beginners.,"Nice for an workout when I want to take it easy, but I'm in good shape, and work out a lot. Definitely good for a beginner type workout."
4,"Not a comedy, but very thought-provoking","Douglas Adams has recently passed, but this volume remains as a testament to the type of person he was. Not just a humorist, but a true hitchhiker, wanting to see and explore every frontier. He brings the reader closer than most will ever get to some animals that, by their very scarcity, have become truly beautiful."
3,nice book,Last Chance to See was an ok book. It had intresting facts on there that i didn't know before. Some parts were boring and seemed to drag on. It had some subtle jokes in it which were pretty funny. So overall it was a good book with nice facts
4,Pretty Good,"This is an interesting, quick read that is entertaining and gives a person something to really think about. I enjoyed the narration, it gave me a sense of what visiting these places would be like, and a often humorous take on the animals encountered keep a rather grimm subject matter light hearted. Maybe if more people read things like this, there wouldn't be so many animals on the edge (and some in this book already past the edge) of extinction."
5,"As always, Douglas Adams excels!",I just recently read this 10 year old book. It was absolutely fascinating and Adams conveyed the ideas superbly. It give a little more insight into Doug Adam's brain (quite a brain I must say!) And it also conveys the desperate measures we have come to to try and save wildlife from extinction. I think that these days we are drifting away from environmental issues but we must cling to them and work hard to save the remaining wildlife.
5,A touching glimpse into the delicate balance of life,"Douglas Adams shines again. A truly prolific writer with an amazing gift. In 'Last Chance to See', Adams shows us a more touching and serious side of his amazing writing talents and vision. In exploring creatures of our planet that may not be here much longer, the wry brilliance in his humor provides a glimpse into the tea-time of our souls here on earth and the chaos we humans sometimes impart on it. A must read for anyone who is concerned with the unique and rare creatures on our planet."
5,Poignant and hysterically funny at the same time.,"Douglas Adams has accomplished much with this very clever book. He has made the potentially treacherous transition from writing satiric science-fiction to relatively straight but opinionated non-fiction. He has also taken a subject that is generally dry and preachy and has successfully reworked it as entertainment of a high level for readers who give it a shot. Perhaps the most surprizing aspect of this book is that he overlayed it with the funniest observations about the insanity of international travel that I have ever lost it over. Anyone who has had to deal with seemingly inexplicable rules in distant locales will have to make periodic pit stops to avoid loss of bladder control. This book is both a hoot, and a touching reminder of how fragile the ecology of our world is."
3,Last Chance Maybe?,Good book but not entirely without room for error. we are still in the finding process with a lot of this information. Some species are not as endangered as originally though and I for one like that kind of news keep reading though about animals and specie preservation the subject is with merit.
3,this is my review,"This book was incredibly funnuy and informative. The authors bizarre sense of humor and spunk added much to reading this book. The way that the authors explain the kinds of things they are seeing and doing in complete detail really keeps the reader interested. This book shows that people really do care about wildlife. Most of the animals they encounter on their journey I have never even heard of before. My favorite part is about the kamodo dragon. I love how he anthropomorphizes these animals. The most interesting animal was the Kakapo. Not only does it have an odd name, but the features of this bird are incredible. Who knew that there are so many plants and animals becoming extinct every year? I definitely give mad props to these people that care and are trying to make a difference in the animal world."
3,The Endless Search,"Too many endangered animals not enough time, more like too much to read and not enough time, thanks Scott. This book was informing but that's about it. I don't usually like to read about two men traveling the globe together looking for animals but never seeming to find them. After reading this book I am informed now of what is happening to the Komodo Dragons, the Kakapos, the White Rhinos from Zaire, and the Yangtze River Dolphins but I still feel the same. Adams, one of the men traveling, has a ""unique"" sense of humor that he throws at you every once in a while to keep you reading. I did not hate it but I won't read it again. If you have a lot of time on your hands and don't care what you read then this is the book for you."
3,class,The book was funny but only after the jokes were broken down in class. On the serious side of the book it tells all about animals in danger of dieing off. Every trip that Adams and Carwardine took some thing interesting happened to make to trip even more memoralble. Over all the book is easy but yet hard to read depending on the reader.
3,Last Chance to Read this Book,"Last Chance to See didn't exactly get me hooked. I had to read this book for class and this thin, paperback, eight chaptered book took me endless months to finish. Overall, i'm glad i read this book, otherwise i would never know what a komodo dragon was or a fruit bat. but it's also sad that these fascinating animals that exist are almost extinct. So read the book it might be the last chanct to read this book, before it becomes extinct off the shelves."
5,"A display of intelligence, humanity and humour","I read this book because of the author, no doubt about that!I had read ""The Hitchikers Guide To The Galaxy"" and wanted more laughing...And I got it... But I got much more!Never before has a book on rare species or ecology in general touched me so deeply. Douglas Adams masters the art of writing engaged and funny while actually telling important messages, that you can't help to be deeply moved by.When you turn the last page, you have to restrain yourself not to take the next plane to Mauritius to help save the pink pigeon, or New Zealand in search of the Kakapoo!This is the best non-fictious book I have ever read, maybe the best book at all!Read it!"
2,"Sorry, But This Book Should Be Extinct","Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine are guys who guide you through unfamiliar territories of endangered animals in the wild. To name a few they search for the White Rhino, Komodo Dragon, and Silverback Mountain Gorilla, both guys gave me a humorous vibe but I just wasn't felling their story it was to bland and boring,boring,Boring!It was nice getting to know about the kakapo a bird that was crazy for sex I would had never known such a bird species existed. Other than that I did not care for the mood of the story it was written sarcastically with no excitement. No point to the book just because we common people will never see an animal in the wild doesnt mean we dont care about nature"
2,A major disappointment.,"There are some insightful and witty observations about animals in this book. Unfortunately, they are buried in the mostly unfunny stories of his travels to the location of the animals. The condescending and sometimes racist attitudes Douglas Adams shares about people in other countries were disturbing."
2,Last Chance to See,The book Last Chance to See was a pretty good book. I really don't like reading but it was an ok book. I would not read it again because i hate to read. But if u are looking for a good book about endangerd aniamls then this is the one for you.
1,Dazed and Confused,"Last Chance to See was a book about a group of people going around the world and taking pictures of endangered or nearly extinct animals. I thought this book was an okay read. I did not love it, but I read it anyway. It was fascinating to find out about all the endangered animals out there in the world. Some of the animals mentioned in this book I never even heard of before. I enjoyed the pictures also because I was then able to put a face to a name with the animals mentioned in the book. I did not like some of the parts of the book, because they traveled so much that I often was confused while reading it. The strange spelling of the words in the book, and the humor sometimes through me off. In the end I feel this book was written for a good cause to let people know about all the animals out theree that are near extinction."
1,Bad Choice to Read,After my first time reading a Douglas Adam and Mark Carwardine book for my English class has made a bad impression on them. Douglas and Mark have boring ways of telling stories when it comes to traveling and exploring animals. Another thing is that the book doesn't contain any action. I highly wouldn't recommend that this book be used for any school purposes.
4,All Right animals,"In the book last chance to see i think the book was ok. Some parts in the book i liked and some i disliked. I liked when they were in China and looking for some comdoms,but the Chinese people didn't understand what they were talking about. I thought that part was funny and made the book more interesting. I felt the book had it's bad parts too because while reading this book it talks about too many animal,and got me confused on what animal was on what Island. Over all the book was ok and it did give you facts on how many animal are still alive. It also give you information where to find some of the animals they were looking for. I would recommend this book to people who like all animals that are in the forest."
5,"Solid, Serious Fun","This book touches on a very serious topic, basically, the extinction of several species of animals that adams is fortunate enough to get to see. As his title suggests, this might well be the last chance he (or anyone else) has to see some of these amazing creatures. However Adams does not loose his sense of humor and with the keen eye of a true observer of anything interesting, he manages to make the reader laugh out loud many times with some of his descriptions of places, people and even animals. His description of the echo-locating Chinese cyclists brought tears to my eyes.This book is great, get it."
4,Great Fun,"What a fun, informative, important book. I put it on my summer reading list for my students!"
4,Entertaining and educational reading,"This is a book written with the typical humor of Douglas Adams - nothing boring about this book! It's an enjoyable read from the perspective of travel writing in addition to the educational value. The animals they search out are unique and interesting, and the story is told in a lively and fascinating manner. I definitely recommend this book to nature lovers."
5,42 Stars for Douglas Adams,"Part travel journal, part nature guide, part diary...all with the to-the-bone insights that made Douglas Adams brilliant. Definitely one of my top 5 books EVER!"
4,Interesting.,"This is a nonfiction book chronicling science fiction writer Douglas Adams attempt to find endangered animals around the globe. He is joined in his quest by, animal expert Mark Carwadine. Together, the 2 amazingly different people travel, talk and just have a good time. Their goal is to alert the casual reader, to the possibility of animal extinction. Adams' sense of humor is still there, amongst the gritty truth but, it may shine through a little too much. It's hard for me to tell what he's being serious about. I recommend this book."
5,Classic Douglas Adams. Need I say more?,"If you're one of those who don't care about the Earth we share, then pass this book by. Otherwise, you owe it to yourself to be guided by a great humorist, who doesn't forget that it's important to laugh even when faced with the most improbable tasks in conservation. Sometimes, that's all we can do.A most thought-provoking, touching reminder of the fragile Earth."
4,Explaining a tragic situation - the Douglas Adams way,Adams used his extraordinary narrative abilities to describe - in language at once humorous and brutally forthright - not only the endangered creatures he was looking for but how they became endangered. You'll feel an urgency to act while there is still time.
5,Douglas Adams' Finest,"Douglas Adams is one of the funniest authors alive. And were it not for this book, that would be all he'd ever be. This book, however, transcends humor. Whereas the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is one of the funniest books ever, no question, this book has a far more serious bent. In this book, Douglas Adams goes searching for endangered animals, and in the process winds up taking a hilarious and yet very insightful look into human nature and society. The book essentially looks at various aspects of the question ""What makes humans different from animals?"" And although it is riotously funny, it has some brilliant observations on this note. This book is quite simply amazing, and is one of my favorite books ever, no questions asked. It is, I think without a doubt, the finest book Douglas Adams has ever written."
5,Life mimics fiction,"Absolutely fabulous. Adams way with words will make you care about plants and animals that you probably have never heard about. It's also refreshing to know that even someone as well known as Douglas Adams can still have the same rotten luck as the rest of us. Every twist and turn in his journey helps the reader to understand the mind of the author (did he base Arthur Dent after himself?) and holds your attention, even if you don't care about conservation. I recommend this book highly. My wife (who is not an Adams fan, nor a conservationist) has also enjoyed the book immensely."
5,A Wild Adventure,"The book is bery unique. I like the book because the narrator is a great writer. He makes the book more interesting with many of the embarrassing experieces. The book itself is animated with great descriptions of the many endanger animals they got to see. The many places that Adams, and the missionaries travel. The amazing adventures they when trough when meeting new people. The pictures and the places Adams describe when visiting gives a clear vivid picture. In the book, Adams take us the readers to a second world that none of us have ever been, but would be egger to go out and experience in our own.After I read the book I though in my mind of the many endanger animals and become concern. I would recommend the book to people who is very much interested on wild animals and like to travel. As for me it was interesting and fun reading the book. You'll like it!"
5,Exelent traveling book,This book shows that Douglas Adams can do far more than writing far-out (but still exelent) books. I think people who a) loves to travel in the remote areas of the world or b) is interested in the difficult situation many of our planets animals are facing in todays world or c) just want to read a briliant and funny book about traveling in some of the more exiting parts of the world should take a closer look into this book. I personaly liked the african part of the book where various officials continously moved them from place to place within the same 25 square meters.
4,A Great Description of Endangered Animals,Last Chance to see is a great book. I don't like to read much and this book seemed kind of boring to me but once I got further into the book it was very good. Douglas Adams describes with great detail the exotic locations in which he is at that he makes me feel like I'm right there with him. I liked the way he writes how difficult it is of a journey to get from place to place just to see rare animals. Throughout the book he gives great information about certain animals that I didn't know about. The exotic and endangered animals in this book are described in such a way by Adams that I feel like doing something about them. I would recomend this book to anyone who is unaware of how close we are to killing out important animals.
5,The most seriously funny book by Douglas Adams,"A series of stories of explorations to the last few remaining members ofalmost-extinct species. Although the subject is serious, the dry humor ofDouglas shines through every page of this book. Never heard of the kakapo(flightless bird that walks miles before it makes its mating call), theYangtze dolphin or the Rodrigues fruit bat ? well, be fast, this may be thelast time.Just one little snippet to get a feel for his style:""The problem, it gradually transpired after a conversation whichflowed like gum from a tree, was this. She would only acceptTanzanian currency. She knew without needing to ask that we didn'thave any, for the simple reason that no one ever did. This was aninternational transit lounge, and the airport had nocurrency-exchange facilities, therefore no one who came in herecould possibly have any Tanzanian currency and therefore shecouldn't serve them."""
5,What a wonderful mind Mr. Adams possesses,"Again Douglas Adams amazes. We were all so fortunate that this gentleman had the gift of writing his thoughts. How else would we have ever been able to enter such a wonderful mind. In this book he writes about animals that are in danger and may not be with us too much longer. The sad thing is that he is the one who is no longer with us. Myself, I would trade one of the animals he wrote about to have him back. He is missed but his work is celebrated.Aloha Douglas..."
5,simply hilarious,"I'm not an environmental nut at all, but I truly enjoyed this book. Douglas Adams is a master of all types of humour. I have read all of his other books, hitchhiker's guide series, dirk gently, and this was by far my favorite book by him."
2,Last Time I Will Read this Book,"As an animal lover and enthusiast I was tricked into believing I would like this book. Two men searching the globe for animals that may someday not be here any more seems like it could be exciting, but it was anything but that. There was no point to this book. The only thing it did, besides bore you, was maybe inform you about some animals who are endangered. But you can just look at a list for that, there is no need to read a whole book. So just because you like animals, trust me it doesn't mean you will like reading about these men trying to find them."
2,Doesn't charge well,"I had a lot of trouble with these batteries. The original pack that I bought had batteries and some of the batteries were defective. I realized this when I was on vacation in another country and my DSLR's flash was not working when I used these particular batteries. In any case, I had to contact Sunpak so that they could send me knew ones, which they eventually did months later."
3,I read and enjoyed this entire series back in the day,"This entire series was a collection of cool, somewhat new, ideas in science thinking at the time. Most would still stand up today. I give it 3 out of 5 only because there is so much good competition in SF literature. Not a bad score just an average score."
5,"One of her best, and most underrated, works of art","I usually write extremely long reviews, but this one will be short and sweet. I felt the need to share my opinion of this album since it was such an integral part of my childhood and contributed largely to the music taste I have today.Simply put, this album got a bad rap. Not only were people way more closed minded in the 90s, but Whitney had done such a good job of portraying a polished, squeaky clean image that everyone was biased against a different sound from the beginning. True Whitney fans like myself, and many many others that have reviewed here, loved and appreciated this album from its debut and I'm truly glad to see how many people have expressed that in these reviews.Whitney may no longer be with us, but her music always will. This album is one of the many jewels in her collection, that will help her fans remember her unrivaled talent and the impact she made on the lives of so many."
5,A Classic 20 Years Later!,"I can't say enough about this album!!! 1 of my favorites. As I sit here and listen to ""Miracle,"" it dawns on me that this album is 20 years old!!!! Wow! Can U believe it!? And it hasn't lost any of its greatness!!!! I can listen to it from start to finish. It always sounds brand new to me. The title track is my JAM! I never get tired of it! I've read some other reviews, and I must agree: this is my favorite of all her albums!! I already luved LA and Babyface's work, so for them to get with Whitney made it even better. Just had to write a review. Don't sleep on this album!!"

3,Average,"This is an average effort by Whitney Houston. This album has two big songs on it ""I'm Your Baby Tonight"" and ""All The Man That I Need"" the rest is just filler and none of this album is rememorable to say the least. This album came off her two highly successful album and if not for the Bodyguard Soundtrack this probably would have been the last breath in her career. This album did poorly in comparison in only selling 4 million copies. I don't recommend this album."
3,List of songs,1. I'm Your Baby Tonight2. My Name is Not Susan3. All the Man that I Need4. Lover for Life5. Anymore6. Miracle7. I Belong to You8. Who Do You Love9. We Didn't Know10. After We Make Love11. I'm Knockin'
1,WHITNEY TRYIN' TO BE PEBBLES OR PAULA ABDUL?,"When Whitney aproached to make her third album she stood by some old time friends, but she managed to team up with the famous producing team of Babyface and LA Reid, somehow that came as a tragical direction for Whitney...she sounded like she wanted to fit in a musical style that wasn't her...but great tracks came as a result ""My Name Is Not Susan"" although the title is corny and stupid...the song chorus and beat managed to stay in a great taste that captures the late 80's beats, ""I'm Your Baby Tonight"" first single managed to reached #1 , gracefully because it was a Whitney Houston but it was really far from Whitney's classic upbeat songs, ""All The Man That I Need"" is one of the songs that really stand aside from the filler cuts that crowed this LP, and surprise this wasn't produced by Babyface....so this album should be call the album that ""almost"" killed Houston career, saved later by The Bodyguard smashing soundtrack."
3,GOOD BUT HAVE BEEN BETTER,"Whitneys' first pair of albums were truly excellent! This third album is still vastly very good but does'nt quite match the quality or success of the first two albums but never the less there are still a remarkable number of really great tracks, including, I'M YOUR BABY TONIGHT, ALL THE MAN THAT I NEED, LOVER FOR LIFE, MIRACLE, I BELONG TO YOU and a duet with the legendary Stevie Wonder, WE DID'NT KNOW. The album is multiply produced by such established talents as LUTHER VANDROSS, BABYFACE, MICHAEL MASSER and WHITNEY HOUSTON herself. On the whole a good album with a few rather nondescript records that give this an inconsitency in comparison to some of her other albums. Good and recommended!"
4,A GEM,"I remember hearing the songs from this album when I was in junior high school. They are still enjoyable. Her voice is golden. This is a different Whitney from her two preceding albums. She is more than just ballads. Her song ""Lover for Life"" is an underrated classic. ""I Belong to You"" is good too."
3,Patchwork,"This set only spawned three major hit singles: ""I'm Your Baby Tonight,"" ""All The Man That I Need,"" and ""Miracle."" Beyond those three hits, there isn't much on this disc worth bothering with- which probably explains why the singles after ""Miracle"" didn't do very well. If you really want those hits, pick it up (only 2 of them appear on her hits collection), but if you're looking to explore her best material, you won't find it here."
5,I like the song All the man that I Need,"I like the one song All the man that I need. For Whitney's better albums, go get Whitney and Whitney Houston."
4,An Absolute Belter,"I never understood why Whitney's star begain to wane on this album as IMHO it yielded her most consistent work to date, including the wonderful title track (didn't like the remix single version) & the soaring All The Man That I Need - these are definitive Whitney singles for me. Whitney proved her worth on Lover For Life; the vocal arrangement on this is superb & which Whitters did herself. I Belong To You is a strong yet tender piece & as for After We Make Love - it's one of my fave 'baby-making' songs. Her voice builds up to a tremendous crescendo before assuming a more sensitive edge again. Album's only weak point is the final track, I'm Knockin' which Whitney co-wrote. Not awful, but not a classic either. It sits uncomfortably & seems like a throwaway song that was added to the end. Add to this catalogue a nice duet with his Wonderness, Mr Stevie W & the single Miracle & you have what is a very commendable CD, which is still listenable over 11 years later."
2,Not the best album,"'I'm Your Baby Tonight,' Whitney's 1990 release and 3rd studio album is clearly not her best. The songs on this CD just seem underdeveloped and lacking of any real flare. Its just a lot of well crafted pop songs that she isn't really putting her soul into. There are a few jems however, 'Miracle' is startling and well delivered. 'All The Man That I Need' isn't a bad cut, and the title track is quite catchy, its just that the rest of the album seems like filler around those three strong numbers."
1,Its very heavy :-(,"I don't know but, the size was way too big for me, and this wedge is very heavy to wear, I haven't wore them, I have only tried fitting the wedge and walk back and forth, already then its very heavy... No don't buy them :-("
1,Loved these...but falling apart after 4 wears!,"I absolutely love these shoes. They are adorable...and comfortable. Unfortunately, today is only my 4th time to wear these and the sole is completely separated from the platform heel. I about broke my neck walking down a flight of stairs at work when I noticed this. I guess I'll have to try to find some really strong shoe glue. I am extremely disappointed!"
4,Simple to use and very helpful around the shop!,"I get tired of wondering if batteries around the shop are good or bad. So I went to Autozone to buy one of these and they were $40 bucks. Well, I went on Amazon and got for almost half and I am very plead all around with quality and usefulness of this item. Another great purchase on Amazon. But some things are actually cheaper at your local store so price shop!"
1,Check when you get it!,"Bought this last November, tried it today, nothing. No needle movement, barely the smell I was expecting and I can't return it.So, calling Schumacher tomorrow to see if I can at least get a replacement.Try yours, if you buy one as soon as you get it!This sucks and it's my own fault."
1,Disappointed,"On the first battery tested, the unit smoked after 2-3 seconds. Presumably, you have it attached and can take up to 10 seconds to remove the surface charge in order to obtain a true strength reading of the battery. I will not check any other batteries with this unit. The shipping time was as expected and the packaging was excellent. The Schumacher BT-100 is a disappointment. I should have paid more to purchase a more high quality product with a digital readout."
3,Does the job.,This battery tester does exactly what it says it will do. It is made rather cheaply and after about a week's worth of use the cables were they connect to the ends started to work there way a little lose but the tester leads still make good connection. For the price this is usable and hard to beat.
5,OUTSTANDING! Schumacher does it again!,"My Grandpa, my Dad, and I have always used Schumacher chargers over the years and have never been disappointed. Well, same goes for this device. It came quickly, was well packaged, and worked PERFECTLY. For the price (especially), you can't go wrong. The meter is easy to read and the device is easy to use. If you are on the fence about buying this, go for it! You'll be glad you did."
4,More than adequate for non professional use,"How many cars do you have in your household? Any motorcycles, boat, lawn tractor, generator, golf cart, anything else with a big battery? This tool is not appropriate for small batteries, but anything that needs to power a starter motor or a pump can be checked and you know for certain if the battery needs replacing or you might have another problem. As such it will pay for itself rather quickly. Easy to use, clear instructions, looks very robust."
5,Works as advertised!,"What can I say? Its a good quality battery load tester. Very similar to the ones you will find in many stores. There are newer styles with digital displays, but they cost more. This unit is really all anyone should need to determine the charge level of their battery, and, with the load test, if the battery is just bad and needs to be replaced."
5,You want it,"No novice. Wanted to be sure about replacing batteries. Bought it for marine batteries in offshore boat. Costs way too much to guess. Not really the quality for an automotive garage but for moderate use, I'm totally satisfied. Great service and value to."
3,Smokehouse products are a great buy,"My dogs didn't like these as well as other Smokehouse products. They much prefer the chicken tenders or the duck and sweet potato treats. They still liked them, but just didn't appear as excited as they do with the others"
3,ONION...,"...Is what Rick Wakeman calls this album, because it brings tears to his eyes! In case that went over your head, that means he doesn't view it with fondness. Although I'm a long time fan, I try to be fair. And this reported rush-job production actually turned out rather well. The joining of 'Old' and 'New' Yes was the only way to resolve legal and creative differences. The best 'ABWH 2' and Trev Rabin songs were combined in a soberingly natural-sounding way. Rabin gets the nod for the best songs here with the honestly uplifting ""Lift Me Up"" and the sprightly ""Miracle Of Life"". Kudos also goes to ABWH for ""I Would Have Waited Forever"", the rock-riffy ""Shock To The System"" and the lovely ""Ankor Wat"". And Steve Howe gives us a lovely acoustic ditty called ""Masquerade"". How about a whole other album like that, Steve? Worth getting for the sheer Yes-History value."
4,Not As Bad As You Think.....,"This one has its great moments (even the bashers had to admit that!) like ""I Wiuld Have Waited Forever"", ""Lift Me Up"", ""Masquerade"", and ""Miracle of Life"". I admit it has its mediocre songs like""Ankor Wat"" (probably the worst song on this CD), ""Holding On"", and ""Take the Water to the Mountain"". The rest of the stuff, given time, grew on me like ""Saving My Heart"", ""Shock to the System"", ""Without Hope"", and ""The More We Live"". Ok, maybe not a true union of most of the Yesmen (8 out of 14 members unfortunately split between 2 seperate projects), but like the supergroup Asia, it had potential that was better than the actual execution. I wish Yes had released a live album of the Union tour, but chances are tensions were so great, it would've been difficult."
2,Disappointing to say the least,"Well, this is not the outright disaster that many critics would have you believe it is, but that doen't mean its very good either. The ABWH songs are much better than Rabin's stuff (except for the really catchy ""Miracle of Life""). However, they seem to be pursuing a completely different (and less interesting) direction than on the previous ABWH album.If the band(s) had taken the half of the songs on here that are pretty good, worked them into proper Yes epic lengths and dropped the rest, this would be a pretty good album. As it is, this cd runs way too long with way too much dross. It's shocking to me that between the two ""bands"" at work here they couldn't come up with more good songs."
2,Disappointing,"This had so much potential. The ABWH tracks sound unfinished, and according to Wakeman, were so doctored by the producer Jonathan Elias to be unlistenable. The merging of the 2 Yes camps onto one disc may have been good marketing, but the results were shoddy. The Rabin songs were less than standard, and no studio tracks ever feature all 8 key players together. So many extra people on it added to the confusion, and while it isn't actually horrible, it is probably the worst YES album to date. Has some moments, but too much filler, a good marketing ploy gone bad, Great tour , though."
4,"I liked it, anyway","I don't know why this album gets trashed so much. It is a nice blend of old and new Yes, taken from a time when all the Yes factions couldn't muster enough material for a single album. Union contains a few Jon Anderson tracks, Chris Squire's new-song-of-the-decade, a Crimson-like piece from Bruford and Levin, a Howe solo, and a few Trevor Rabin numbers; all blended together to give them some semblance of continuity. Pretty much Yes-as-usual, compared to (say) Tormato. The album has many mememorable tracks. Maybe it's just because I got into Yes shortly after this album came out, and it was one of my first exposures to Yes, that I like it."
2,Sometimes interesting,"The most disappointing things about this album are Steve Howe's questionable solos and Rick Wakeman's virtual absense from the pieces he's supposedly playing on. The Levin/Bruford rhythm section redeems the Anderson/Howe/Bruford/Wakeman tunes somwhat. The Anderson/Kaye/Rabin/Squire songs are, I hate to admit, better. Trevor Rabin's sparse solos are fairly tasty, and he knows how to write a catchy song. ""Miracle of Life"" and Squire's ""The More We Live"" are perhaps the best tunes on the disc. I like the latter, because Chris Squire gets to sing some parts by himself...great voice! What's going on with Steve Howe? He didn't always play poorly like this. I think he lost it on Tormato, and never recovered."
3,"Good, but not great","This is good, but certainly not among their best. If you already have a good Yes collection and are looking for more, this might be a good addition."
3,A listenable album.,"I've never considered Union to be a poor album. It's always surprised me how some people dislike it. I have had Union in my music collection for several years. I listened to it quite a bit when I first got it. I don't listen to it much now, but I still think that it's respectable. There are some interesting and listenable tunes throughout. My favorite ones are ""Lift Me Up"" and ""The More We Live - Let Go."" Steve Howe's guitar work on ""Masquerade"" is very good. I dig the guitar riff to ""Shock to the System,"" also. Jon Anderson is never disappointing when it comes to the lead vocals. ""Miracle of Life"" and ""Saving My Heart"" are good, too. None of the songs on this album are terrible. Union's musicianship and songwriting are satisfying. The production is not bad. Union isn't a personal favorite disc, but it's still worth a listen."
5,Excellent Yes album,"Unlike alot of folks who are die hard Yes fans and rip everything that has been produced by the group post 1979, I really enjoy all the 80s and 90s stuff. I suppose 90125 is my favorite, and really was the first Yes album I bought and listened to. However Union has some really good tracks on it and I find myself listening to it quite a bit as the years go by. Alot of people put it off as some kind of pop album, but I really dont consider it to fit squarely in that vein. The songs are kind of disjointed rock, synthesizer ensemble that manage to produce some outstanding tunes. Different, yet it really grew on me. If you liked some of their later work, definitely give it a shot."
3,Mixed emotions,"This is a strange album from Yes, I won't repeat the story of its creation. As everybody knows, there is two line-up of Yes in the album.The problem is that it create an uneven album. Newer fans will find the songs of ABWH pretentious and older fans will be angry against Trevor Rabin for his strong influence on the band. The result is an album that doesn't fit the need of anybody. Too many musicians, too many influences and different styles. The effect is that we have an album with no coherence, yes there is some good cuts from both line-up but the result is, as some other reviewer said, a smashed potato !"
1,"God, what a mess...","I think it started out as a great idea that kind of gotten taken away with itself. I heard ""I Would Have Waited Forever"" as an advance on radio and remember being really encouraged. After giving it an initial listen on buying it, I felt a little ripped off. The disc has flashes of brillance here and there, but it could have used a lot more coherence. Completists only need apply."
4,Horrible,"**I rated this as 1 star, not sure why it is showing 4**I'm a big Yes fan, I like the older Prog stuff and even such critically panned albums as ""Big Generator"" ""Tormato"" and ""Open Your Eyes,"" but this is easily the worst album I have ever heard. Union features musicians from both eras of Yes, plus about twenty ""additional musicians"" (apparently there were two separate albums that were implemented into Union, one Yes and one ABWH or something like that) making it a big deal and making Union way too over-hyped.As several people have said the only good song on this album is ""Lift Me Up,"" which is (unfortunately) overlooked because it happens to appear on this trash. ""I Would Have Waited Forever,"" and ""Miracle of Life"" are probably the only other decent songs on the album. Unless you're a Yes fan who is trying to complete your collection, this album isn't worth 50 cents."
2,"Curioso, curioso","Sí, es curioso. A la vista de las valoraciones globales, éste disco, en el momento en que hago esta reseña, tiene cuatro estrellas y media. Las mismas que Close to the Edge y que Relayer y más que Yes album, Tales o Drama. ¿De verdad alguien se cree que este Unión está a la altura de Close o Relayer?. Por favor. Entiendo que sea un disco que pueda tolerarse, que tenga algún que otro (pocos por cierto) buenos momentos, pero, de ahí a decir que es superior a Yes Album. Es casi obsceno hacer tal afirmación.Unión es un disco que nació ya abortado. Fué un intento desesperado y apresurado de unir las dos facciones de Yes, la americana y la que representaban ABWH, pero en ningún momento se intuye la forma de grupo, es más una amalgama de canciones de ambos bandos, en un momento en el que la calidad no era precisamente el sello del grupo. Algún temita de Howe y poco más en un disco que pasa por ser el peor de Yes."
5,the best,"i'am probably your youngest fan, i am 15 years old, and i think yes is the greatest band in the world, it just grabs me how jon anderson can sing like that and get your attention like that, i love it ...........thank you for your time its really been a pleasure talking here"
1,Pretty bad.,"I have been going through Yes as of late and good god around 77' they pretty much bit the dust. I DO like some of their eighties stuff, some of their weirdest, just because a few of the songs have that 80s charm but this here is garbage. Worse than the 80s stuff. The lyrics are so bad I don't even know where to rank it in their discography. When these guys write bad lyrics they do it with conviction! It's down there with Tormato, Drama, Open Your Eyes, The Ladder, etc. Just listen to this for a bit and then compare it to one of their classic albums. People who rate this 5 stars should be ashamed of themselves. King Crimson really does make these guys look like a bunch of idiots when you compare the same time periods, especially the late 70s/80s where Crimson actually remained excellent. At least it is kind of fun to revisit this stuff once in a great while."
3,Yes Union,"I remember buying this album on tape when it came out in 1991 and i replaced it on cd a few years back.this was the last Yes album that had a lot of good songs on it.Yes should of quit after the next album Talk cause they no longer can write any good songs.this album was the one where all the members in Yes history were on a tour for this album.a few classics are on this record,Life Me Up Saving My Heart were on radio also Shock To The System I Would Have Waited Forever and Silent Talking catchy great vocals melodies by John and nice guitar solo's by Steve Howe and Trevor Rabin The More We Live Let Go should of been a hit nice ballad.the other songs are Yes trying to do rap and randb Dangerous etc.this is the last album by Yes any Yes fan should listen to the other have maybe a song or two The Ladder Open Your Eyes etc. I give this a 4 rating since it was the last decent yes album"
3,Controversy?,"There is much controversy about this album haveing about a thousand people on it and Rick Wakeman thru the tape out the window of his car upon hearing it for the first time. How does that happen anyway that you record a album and they change it without you knowing about it? What a joke. Anyway, I like it alot and it is an epic record with both camps coming together on this one. I think ABWH was really on the right track and who knows how great their second release would have been before they merged with YesWest."
3,"Not a classic, but worth the admission.","I just recently picked up this CD a few days ago, and I was debating for quite a while in the store about getting this CD. I am not the biggest YES fan, and all I own is 90125. However, I was quite suprised. There are some real strong tracks on here. Shock to the System is a strong hard rocker should have been the first track reminds me a bit of Rush's Stick it out. Masquerade is a nice acoustic guitar instrumental, Lift Me Up is a passable pop rocker with a great intro. Without Hope You Cannot Start the Day, and Slient Talking are probably the two closest things to classic Yes or Progressive Rock at the least, they were my two favorite tracks, and definitely worth the listen. Saving My Heart is a okay song with a decent Chours the rest I found average at best. I want to give this CD a higher score it's more or less 3 and a half stars not a classic CD, but definitely still holds up pretty well 15 years definitely worth the admission."
1,peor de lo que te piensas,"La gente (poca) a la que le gusta este disco, al dar sus razones, muestran las que, a entender de todo amante del Yes clásico, deben alejarle de comprar este disco. No es mas que AOR del que dando una ""patada a un árbol"", caen cien mil discos similares. No hay magia, no hay estructura, no hay nada. Solo hay guitarreos insulsos, tipo heavy blandito y ""posturero"", y muchos coros para tapar la falta de ideas.Un bodrio"
2,Ouch!,"Only 4 songs make this album worth listening to: Shock to the System, Masquerade, Life me Up, and Miracle of Life. These four tunes are excellent; especially the enchanting instrumental, Masquerade. This album just shows you what happens when a lot of talented musicians all try at once to grab the spotlight (or the YES name) at the same time. Enough already. This album makes it clear that in spite of the valliant attempt at cohesiveness, individuality kills the group as a whole. Maybe the guys will realize this down the road."
3,Two for the Price of Two,"The reviewers that talk about this album being a divided effort hit it right on the head. It's like two different albums melted together and baked into a pie. I only give it three stars because of the superiority of the ABWH tunes such as Shock to the System , Without Hope You Cannot Start the Day, and Silent Talking. It is the awfulness of the Rabin tunes such as Lift Me Up and Saving My Love that drags the album down and makes it necessary to hit the advance button on the CD player. Rabin's work on 90125 was much better; did he get a lobotomy or something? The best thing to do with this album is rip the good tunes onto your PC, then make a coaster or a skeet target of the CD.PS: I think Dangerous is actually a great tune; the ABWH outfit pulls off an intense rocker rather nicely, which is kind of a switch for Yes in general (the pitiful Release Release from Tormato was a rocker attempt that sucked)."
3,Low expectations help,Credit the legendary progressive rockers with releasing what sounds like a pretty solid release-given its context and production date- when most of their peers seemed to exhibit no shame in courting pop radio.
4,I thought it was good,I thought this book didnt get into to to much detail but i thought it was still a good book.. Its a little confusing then again im only 13 and there were like 3 words i didnt no... i would definatly tell my friends to read it even though it doesn't get anywhere at some points! and im still only on page 211 so i dont no how it ends.
2,Fair Plot Ends In a Disappointing Resolution,"While this book did not stray too far from the limits of reality as do many horror books, which make them a little too hoakey, it's poor and unlikely resolution really hurts the power that the book might have even been able to possess."
2,One Bad Book,"Spook was a book with a good theme, good ideas and a good resolution, but Steve Vance could have done a better job at creating suspense in the novel. He also should have explained the ending clearer and the climax should have been more obvious. Some of the characters were interesting and the storyline was good. It just was not written very well and had a lot of boring conversations and no interesting parts to it."
3,No big change,"This item does smell great and does not make my hair heavy and greasy looking. It helps with frizzies, but i would say that it doesn't last very long,.. i maybe need to re-apply more often. But the price was decent."
3,could be more interesting for little kids,"This is not nearly as interesting for 3 year old boys as the Might Machines series. It's pretty ""talky"" and doesn't show quite enough action. My grandson will watch a Mighty Machines video over and over again but watches this only sporadically and sometimes doesn't even sit through the entire show."
4,A delicious romp!,Anyone who enjoys a really good laugh at a well told but highly unlikely story will delight in this book.
3,Works but not easy to install,Wiper works once you get it installed which takes a long time to slide it in and then took a couple of adjustments to get it to sit right on the windshield. For the price it's not bad.
3,Did not fit my wipers,"There should be more info about what cars this fits. The length was accurate for my 2006 Honda Civic, however it was slightly too thick and did not fit into my wiper blade. However I was able to get a refund and did not have to send the blade back so the seller did a good job making up for the problem."
3,Good wiper but did not recieve what I thought I would,"I needed replacement wipers in a size that was hard to find in stores, and these wipers seemed like a good choice. However, even though the picture shows that you get the wiper in its mounting fixture (ready to be easily attached to the oscillating arm on your car), WHAT YOU REALLY GET are replacement rubber blades only (not mounted in their fixture). These can be mounted in the existing fixtures on your car, but it is much more effort to do so. Once I got them mounted, they work fine."
4,"Pathology, not sociology","Wolff wrote this book in reaction to Malcolm Cowley's portrait of Crosby in Exile's Return. Unlike Cowley, Wolff did not find Crosby to be the representative figure for the Lost Generation. He finds Crosby's obsessions with suicide to predate his war service and his interest in the mystic to be Crosby's alone. The book is probably the best possible portrait of a failed poet and wealthy mystic, who happens to have a deathwish, as could possibly be written. So the book is more a study in human pathology than a sociological study of a generation. It's worth reading all the same."
4,Interesting For Wolfe or Paris Fans,"Geoffrey Wolff is among the most underappreciated novelists writing in English. His biography of his father The Duke of Deception is enthralling. This early biography is not quite up to these standards, is too opiniated, and could used some editing. Nonetheless it shows his flair. It is also full of references to Paris and the famous expatriates of the 20s. Be careful to get a copy without a crumpled back page."
3,Needs a little work.,"All in all this did the job but if you were looking for a precision tool this is not the one. I don’t quit understand the bass. Having it sit on three points while it seems like a good idea when you try to work it, it tips. Once secured to a desk top or work board it’s ok. The spring didn’t quit do it for the non dermal tool I had. I haven’t look to see if there is an adjustment. Last there is a fair amount of slop in the system. If you are trying to drill precision holes in circuit boards not the one you should buy. If however you are using it in jewelry making it just might be the right tool for the job."
