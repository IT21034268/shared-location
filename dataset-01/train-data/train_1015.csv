3,So far so good - time will tell,"This is a replacement for the same model that started chirping periodicly in the middle of the night after only one year. So far this one has stopped our interupted sleep and seems to be working. That said, I would never go without smoke alarms as one alerted us to a small fire in our house."
4,alarmed,I purchased this because I have 3 hard wired alarms like it. I did not want to replace them all as they are linked together. I am hoping this one works better than the one replaced.
1,hard to set up,"I am an electronic tech and this was just too hard to set up properly, I was stunned it took me over an hour to get it to work after it was installed"
1,Deceptive title...,I was looking for writing add-in's and 90% of the book was to writing macro's.Waste of my $$$. Highly recommend NOT TO BUY THIS BOOK.
3,Horse Thief,"In 1938 a 17 year old Tullis Yoder worries he will never ride a bull again after losing 2 fingers on his first bull ride. He also finds out his 13 horses (his only family) will be sold to make dog food. He travels by night with the help of a lady docter to steal all of his rodeo horses back. They are pursued by crooks, three sheriffs, a powerful judge, and a girl. It's a fast moving adventure for people who love adventure."
4,As much about buying a boat...,"It's a good book but it's as much about buying the right boat, as it is about living on one. Overall a good read but leaves the practicality out a little. Covers living in the colder Northeast and not in warmer climes such as Florida or San Diego."
3,More like how to live aboard a barge.,"Unfortuately, the book seems to be written much from an RV or houseboat mentality. The major factor in a choice to live aboard a boat is expense, or at least I gather from this read. Much more useful is anything by the Pardeys--always useful classics, or more recently FitzGeralds ""Sea-Steading"""
3,One person's experience,"Contains good info, but limited to this one guy's experince in one northern urban harbor on one type of boat. I would rather have seen a more comprehensive guide."
4,"Good thorough book, but relatively basic.","A great read and very thorough. Repeats himself often and many chapters overlap substantially, however it was still worth while reading."
5,Saved Me $$$$$$ and Lots of Stress,"Without any question, this book helped me save thousands of dollars and really keep perspective when I chose and bought my boat. If I had to sum it up, this book is mostly about perspective on a lot of things, such as the lifestyle of living on a boat, and also on choosing a boat, buying a boat and upgrading a boat. I walked away from 2 boats because of this. And the cost table is like one big myth buster revealing all of the tons of hidden costs of boating. It not only should be read by every liveaboard but I recommend this book for every boater too."
5,Excellent Book!,This was by far the best book that I've read on owning a boat and living aboard (and we've even been passed it around the marina). This book was a great resource and was worth much than its cost. Very highly recommended!
3,Not about crusing,This book is about living aboard a boat in a marina. A life style manymay choose. I thought is was a good read.
2,Too Basic,"Anybody that has spent anytime around boats would know 90% of the information covered in this book. At least it is a quick read so not much time is wasted on it. It would probably be helpful for someone who has never been on a boat but, has plans to move aboard in less than a week."
1,NOT the definitive guide for liveaboards,"Skip this book if:You have NEVER stepped on a boat - I will only get you in trouble...You HAVE stepped on a boat - you know enough to write your own book.Worthless, I will not resell this book but rather give it away with a dollar as a book mark."
1,I'm moving back to land,"What a lousy book. This is nothing butbabbling. The writer offers nothingof substance. I realized I was takenat about page three or four. Then Iread that the writer is a lawyer! Alying cheating lawyer? And his booksucks! Don't buy this book, save yourselffrom another lawyer joke."
2,Light in content,I must say I expected a little more info than was provided in this book. I read through the whole book in under an hour and kept wondering to myself why I bought it!
3,Great guide to living in a marina,"If you have little or no boating experience and are considering living aboard in a marina, you will enjoy this book. Lots of useful tips and information. Not so helpful for people who like to spend their time away from the dock."
3,Umm...,"The official reviews imply that conversation occurs in this book. This is not the case.I bought this thinking that it was a gay romance story. It is, BUT it is a story that is very hard to grasp. Mostly because the characters spend most of their time having sex. Every scene in the book, but 2, is them having sex. It isn't exactly wordy sex either. The real story is in how they treat each other during sex, how it started, where they were doing it, and what they did when they were done. I thought it was an innovative and interesting way to tell a story (also, who calls hot sex a negative?). It was a little out there for me though. I need a little dialogue or even a thought stream or two, call me a traditionalist. Thus, 3 stars. Interesting way to tell a story, just a little too out there for me."
5,Fantastic!,"I can't say enough good things about this CD. I was fortunate enough to attend an actual Friday Night Live service in CA last year, and the music just moved me so much. The CD is just as stirring, I think, whether or not you are Jewish (I am). It's traditional religious music, yet it has a beat and you can dance to it. It is my 5-year-old daughter's favorite CD. She listens to it over and over, especially ""Hashkivenu"". Please buy this! You will feel good about yourself and Judaism!"
3,A cute alternative to your standard Klezmer music,"Craig Taubman is popular in many places, including Swampscott, Massachusetts, where one Shabbat service in October was held in honor of him and his music. Pieces such as Romimu and L'cha Dodi were played. Much of the music is upbeat and happy, with some slower pieces in the mix. I recommend this recording to Jewish people who enjoy modern versions of religious Hebrew songs."
2,"Facinating concept, but errors in text and some murky statements","I actually took a short course in this subject from the author at one of the JSMs. I immediately thought of some research possibilities, but had too much other work to follow up on them.I started to read this book a few years ago, but got bogged down with some examples, that I didn't have time to work through. Now that I am retired, I decided to go through the book again. I find the subject most interesting, and am now on page 66. However, I have found several errors in examples and some murky descriptions, which may be due to imprecise notation. (I'm still trying to figure one out.)"
5,Don't Miss Out On What This Character Brings To The Story,"I am a big fan of the rescue heroes. They are some of the best designed toys I have ever seen, and they are fabulous for imaginative play and teaching lessons about everything from core values of discipline and sacrifice to practical safety like stop, drop, and roll.Cliff Hanger is a particularly nice addition to the collection. First of all, Cliff is uniquely able to ""rescue"" because he can fly in and grab someone or something with his big clamp and pull them out. In every story that my son makes up, Cliff become integral to the solution to the problem. Cliff's glider pack is also very cool. The wings collapse and then pop open at the push of a button. Last, because Cliff uses a glider, I am able to introduce some physics to my son. Of course, I don't call it that, but we talk about how an airplane can fly versus a glider which ""falls with style."" (A reference my son has particular appreciation for.)"
5,Great Toy,These guys are great for your kids from 2 to ?. The toys are very durable and the movies are great with a message about safety at the end.
2,paying for the constitution?,"yes, your paying for a copy of the constitution, one you cant even read, even with the help of magnifying glass.if you still want a poster, get a bigger one, one you can actually read, the words look like tiny scribbles with no indications whatsoever of the actual letters,even taken into account its cursive and not the neatest handwriting, its still too small of a font to read on this poster, and its like expensive for what it is, just a photocopy on a sheet of paper."
2,Just Another Formula,"Trust Fund is the male equivalent of the female romance novel, or the ""new"" chick lit novel.It reads like so many other books in the genre - lots of murders, powerful people, and a side bit of sex.And yet, because it was written by a man, for men, it is an acceptable read in public places."
4,First Time Reader,This is my first read by this author. I actually enjoyed it very much. There could have been a little more substance with the main character and his wife. I will try a couple of more books by Frey and see what happens. All in all it was a decent story.
5,Smooth Style wins again,Frey continues to deliver. This story was a bit over the top but is a great beach book.
4,A great read that goes a little overboard at the end,"&#65279;Trust Fund grabbed me right from the start (a dead body in the beginning always helps). I have read all of Stephen Frey's books and this is one of his best, but one of his bad habits rears its ugly head again. Bo Hancock, the main character is an interesting character and I felt that I could relate with some of the decisions he made. The Hancocks are an interesting clan and they have a lot of problems, but they all seem to believe that money makes it all better, except our hero Bo of course.I thought that the story flowed very well until the last quarter of the book, when Stephen Frey fell into the habit of making everything huge and corruption everywhere. It ended up having a little too much conspiracy theory for me. But if you can accept that this is a great read."
2,Not a very good read. Wait for the paperback.,"I've read all of Stephen Frey's books and can say that I've been very disappointed with his more recent work. Trust Fund isn't about a Trust Fund. The main character is not very likeable. There are too many shady, behind the scenes characters that make cameo apperances making the book a choppy read (because the book really isn't that long). I'm always disappointed when a new author starts churning out a book a year, grisham-like, while quality suffers... Wait for the paperback..."
1,Just Awful,"I picked this up off a used book pile in a bookstore, and luckily only paid 50 cents for it. Never read anything by Stephen Frey before, and never will again. Awful dialogue, superficial characterizations, completely unrealistic situations -- four or five members of this family get clipped in a week and no one seems to notice any pattern or react.The book seemed like one of those role playing computer games where none of the characters react at all to events -- a presidential candidate shoots himself, no reaction; the head of a billion dollar hedge fund gets killed, no reaction. It was laughable.Frey seems to be aiming to be Grisham for the financial set, which is aiming pretty low. Grisham is awful too, but at least grounds his stories in characterization as well as plotting. All Frey does is add an explosion or murder every 15 pages, trying to keep the story moving.Save yourself two hours of your life. Don't read this book."
1,Wish I hadn't bought it,"One of the most contrived ""novels"" I have read in several years. Each action was so implausible that often the author stopped in his tracks and created a little backstory, which only served the stop the action. It is like hearing somebody telling a story who stops and says ""Oh, I forgot to explain ..."" and then backtracking. My hope was to learn a little about Enron-type shenanigans through an interesting story. My money (though a pittance for a paperback version) was as ill-spent as if I had bought Enron stock in September, 2001. Choong!"
1,Save your money and go to your library!,"While I have usually enjoyed Stephen Frey's books, this one is very weak. It is unbelievabe, yes I know it is fiction, unorginal, and unimaginative with a poor ending. I got the feeling Frey had a multi-book committment to his publisher and this was just fulfilling his contract. I pride myself on finishing books, this one was a real struggle."
3,This family has a few problems,"The Hancock family are all powerful. One son is headed for the White House, one son runs the family owned business and the other son is a perceived problem. When the father dies, the story entertwines into a whodunit and we are not sure who the good guys are anymore.I love Frey's work. I am always intrigued by his high finance setting and his quick pace.However, this book left me cold and is definitely NOT his best work. I found myself not really liking any of the characters. The relationships in this book were ALL disfunctional and once again, the women play very, very minor roles (this is a problem I have with Frey's work in general).The pace was stop and go and frankly, the plot was a little ridiculous. Not his best one."
1,Fluffy and terrible,"I normally don't write reviews but this book is so bad I felt compelled to express myself. A terrible book, seems like a never ending string of improbable events (prominent people being killed left and right) tied together to create an implausible plot with a terrible ending. Steer clear of this one, though some of his other books are good."
4,A good one,"Read this one in less than three days and was gardening in between. I love financial stories and this is a good one. Not only loaded with action,the stocks and funds running wild but a multi billion dollar family doing all the directing with all the dislike of one another that could be possible. The intriquing quirk within the story line of a hi-tech idea of mind control handled with CIA type influence also made this greatly to my likes. I have enjoyed all of Stephen Frey's novels and will look forward to more of the same."
3,A so so book from mr. frey,"The hancocks are a very wealthy family established in connecticut who run a multibillion hedge fund.All of the workings over looked by the father jimmy lee hancock.There are 5 children of jimmy lees , bo hancock who is the ceo of the massive fund he has a reputation for heavy drinking and womanizing. Paul hancock who with political clout from jimmy lee's friends is making a run for the presidency.Even though bo is very successful at managing the fund and making 10's to 100's of millions of dollars his reputation appears to having an affect to pauls campaign so jimmy sends him off to montana for a year but is that the real reason for sending him or is there something greater to hide especially as executives and ceo's start ending up dead. I do not think this was one of frey's better books but it does have some fast action"
1,Soft-boiled and soporific,"What a disappointment! I'd read such raves about Ellin and The Eighth Circle in particular. But, I had to force myself to finish it. I found the writing, plot, characterisations and especially the dialogue tame, lame, insipid, unconvincing, uninvolving...you get the idea. Precious. Nice, even. I've read many mysteries and hard boiled detective novels. This was one of the worst. ZZZZzzzzzzz"
2,Kids don't want to spend the time coloring,"I purchased this book for my 2nd grade classroom. With a few exceptions, the kids didn't want to take the time necessary to color in all the designs. They didn't mind doing the math, it was only the coloring that they rushed through. I was disappointed because it seemed like a way to work some fun into the math lesson, but alas, it didn't work out that way."
4,Great CD,"I bought this cd because I am a big Maynard fan, and I was amazed at the songs he can still dish out at his age. He is a great player and I recomend buying this, the solos are absolutely amazing."
2,like nothing I have heard before (i mean in a bad way),"I heard so much about this cd , prior to purchasing it , only to be disapointed, i expted some pure heat, and all I got is one of the weirdest rap cds I have ever purchased, there are 2 songs I like on the cd, but definetly not worth what it is sold for on amazon. If you have not heard this cd yet , do not waste your time, your money can be better spent, cop mr kane , it is much better then this cd. Kokane is one of those artist that are much better on other peoples cds, and not so much on there own cds."
4,Makes me look smart,"I'm an aspiring Strength Coach and I got this chart to help me learn more about the nervous system, but honestly it was too confusing for me so now its just decor on my wall to make me look smart. Which it does. I get compliments on it along with some of my body charts that I understand better than this one. Great price just confusing for my meat head like me."
2,Unfortunately incorrect,"The illustrations by Peter Bachin, unfortunately are wrong. The body, and the, brain, midbrain, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord are reversed (the head is down where the feet should be!). Also the Spinal meninges, intercostal nerves, and sagittal section of female pelvis are depicted in a way that is completely upside-down. The chart looks nothing like the one on amazon (at least that one is right side up!). I wish illustrators like Peter Bachin would spend more time in the morgue and less time just drawing whatever comes up in their wild imagination. The one thing I really do like, however, is the lamination. It's really well done and far better than other anatomical charts I have ordered."
5,T-Track,I used 2 of these T-tracks to make a vertical sliding extension on the ends of a work table in my wood shop. I clamp a 2 x 4 to the top of the slides equal to the height of my table saw. Now I can cut an 8 foot sheet of plywood by myself without having the plywood fall on the floor. Quick and easy to adjust. Free plans for the roll around shop table can be found on the Woodsmith web site.
2,misleading add,"24"" Aluminum Mini-T-Track by Peachtree Woodworking - PW1021Though Peachtree is a fine company this add shows two t-tracks causing me to believe it was a set of two. I ordered what I thought was 2 sets however I only received two t-tracks now I have to order 2 more. I feel the add is misleading and hope it is changed to prevent further confusion."
4,Not quite perfect,I was looking for a small low profile mouse similiar to the one that came with my Mac but for a smaller than Mac price. The feel is good but the drawback is the stiff cord. The cord is way too inflexible and gets caught and yanked as I use it- very annoying.
4,worth the money,Very useful information. This book is good for 10-25 points on your score. If you have never sat for an assessment center this book will take away some of the mystery and give you the advantage.
3,Good info,"Needed some guides for promotion preparation. This is one of several that I purchased, and I think all helped a little in different areas.If you have a lot of time to prepare and study (and you always should be preparing for promotion in ANY job) then get as many books & guides as you can. They will help you do better now, and get recognized now. When promotion time comes - you will be ready!"
3,Not really a tie.,"My own fault perhaps for not reading the product description carefully. This serves more as a headband, not a mens tie to wear."
1,Text too small and book too thick,"If you chose this item for a gift, the recipient will find the text too small to read, and the book back needs to be broken to flatten the pages for reading."
1,Publishing error is distracting and ruins quality of set,"I recently ordered this set off of Amazon and each book had a publishing error that reprinted one extra, erroneous word at the end of almost every page. Very irritating. This item was purchased as a gift for a friend's vacation retreat library. The flaw made it tacky and diminished the quality significantly. I had to return it. It was just lazy and cheap of University Press to sell this printing. Amazon sent a replacement set and it had the same flaw, even though they assured us that it wouldn't. So, I am going with another publisher altogether, and from another book vendor. Don't waste your money on this more expensive collection. It can't even get the basics right."
1,Don't bother with this edition,"Yes, Oxford alright, but a facsimile edition of the first printings from Jane Austen's own lifetime plus a facsimile of the Chapman edition from 1923 (that's as much as I could make out; it requires quite an amount of historical criticism in itself to reconstruct this edition) In other words, it has charm but for our modern eyes, spoiled by superclean desktop publishing, the print is too small, too narrow and WAAAAAY too irregular. I could accept this if it were either an original first edition, or else, if this edition were really cheap. But it isn't. In fact, it's quite costly. My advice: go with the Barnes and Noble editions; they are set in clean type and the introductions are interesting and readable. Plus, they cost a fraction of this edition"
3,"Adds to the complete story of ""Nameless""","Quarry has great ending and completes needed chapter in life of Nameless.While not one of the ""Nameless"" top ten Quarry is essential for the Nameless reader. Looking for more history of characters and less on the SF area."
4,An Organized Approach,"I loved ordering this purse on Amazon. I found the color I wanted, yes it comes in more than black, at the price I was willing to spend. The Expresso color goes perfectly with my favorite beverage!I have had the purse almost a month and I am still organized. Clerks love it when I can find my debit card quickly. My cell phone is at my fingertips.The two facts that stop this product from being a five are: marginally comfortable straps....and the lipstick/pen loops are too big to hold the items.Am I glad I purchased the purse? YES!!Baggallini Wallet Bagg, Large"
2,too complicated,I intended to switch from another bag to this one. I find it far to complicated to use even though it has more room. Sorry I bought it.
5,Best purchase I've made in a long time.,"This bag is the perfect size. It has a compartment for everything, and keeps everything in its place. I love the cell phone compartment on the outside along with sunglasses compartment. I can find everything quickly. I love this bag! It comes in many colors and it is small enough to not notice it on your shoulder."
4,Nice bag!,I got this bag for travel and it is perfect. Not too big or too small and has lots of pockets for credit cards and all the things I like pockets for. I recommend this bag.
2,Not as great as I hoped,"I bought this for a trip. I wanted room for my cell phone, sunglasses, chapstick, plus all the credit cards, cash, id, etc. I wanted to wear it across my body for safety but the strap was extremely irritating to my neck. I wanted to wear it as a fanny pack but the strap would not stay cinched, so it would just slide down my hips to the floor. Since the fabric was soft, it became a strange fat lumpy shape as soon as a few things were thrown in. I haven't used it since returning from the trip, and am now in search of something similar but without the problems this one had."
3,"Nice, except for the credit card slots","This comes so close to being the perfect purse. There are two zippered compartments inside, a pocket outside for your cellphone, and credit card slots inside. And those credit card slots are the unfortunate flaw - the cards fall out constantly! The slots are 1/3 to 1/2 inch too wide. I have another baggalini purse and it has the same problem. Wish they would fix it."
5,Sensible (and easy on the shoulders),"I used to carry the largest purses i could carry, so i could fill them with everything i 'might' possibly need. Baggallini was the solution for me to making a change because it is such an organizer that i can still carry cards, checkbooks, cell phone and keys and not be weighted down. when necessary to carry a larger bag, i just stuff this wallet sized bag into the larger bag. I love this style and size and will be purchasing more. I found amazon's price to be the best also for this particular color."
4,Love it but want more,"This wallet is SO cute! I bought it in navy so it goes well with my jeans that I wear to the grocery store and other casual places. It's small, 7 x 9 inches, but holds a lot, more than I need for the grocery store. It's small enough to throw into my tote as a wallet+ if I need a bigger bag. Just got it so I don't know how it wears yet. I WISH, however, that it was a couple of inches bigger (like 9x12), and came in real leather. I've seen something like it in leather advertised on Amazon but with reports that it doesn't wear well. I paid $35 for this vinyl edition, which looks pretty darn good, but seems a little high to me. I'd be willing to pay $150 for a larger, well made, leather version."
3,Still too SMALL,"I purchased this bag hoping that the measurements given were accurate and that it would be just a little deeper than the one I have. Not so, I have had this identical item for at least 3 years, love it, but it is about 2 inches too short from top to bottom.I returned this bag as soon as I received it. Why doesn't Baggallini make the same bag a bit deeper?I'd love to be able to use it as an everyday bag instead of just for travel."
3,"Good purse, but can't stand the material","This purse has many pockets, but beware if you have a fat wallet. It has sections for credit cards and other cards but they are too shallow, and fall out. The cell phone pocket on the outside fits my Iphone 4 + case perfectly. There are two zipper middle pockets inside for mirror, etc. If you are the kind who likes to throw water bottles, sunscreen in your purse this is not the purse for you. Anything large/thick makes the purse look awkward and bulky.I do like this purse but mine arrived with the white lining showing, and it was dirty so I returned. I would have kept it if not for the nylon fabric. I hate the feeling of nylon against my skin, and as much as I tried to like the nylon I couldn't do it. Overall a good design, needs a few improvements. I just wish Baggalini would make purses in something OTHER then nylon!"
2,The perfect wallet - this one's not mine.,"I like the concept of this wallet. It seems to have a place for everything I needed. However, the bag is very soft and I wanted something with a more solid construction. I would also have liked the credit card compartment to open fully for easier access which it did not. So, reluctantly, I returned the bag and will continue my search for the perfect wallet."
5,Baggallini Wallet Bagg,I am very pleased with my new Baggallini wallet bag. I plan to order similar styles in other colors. It is perfect for holding all the essentials without being too bulky. Seems very well made.
3,Except for the Strap a great bag...,"If you are looking at purchasing the Baggallini Large Wallet Bagg I can recommend it, however be warned that the strap can disconnect very easily. They used a very weak clasp to attach the strap to the bag and if you just hit it a certain way the whole thing falls off on to the floor. I have since ""glued"" the clasps shut. It only happened to me twice in six months but that was enough. Get the Microfiber version of this bag - the crinkle fabric is weak and won't hold up as well."
2,"Inspired performance, but poor recording quality","A great performance by Fela and the band, but I was seriously disappointed by this DVD. The earlier reviews are of the VHS version, which perhaps is a more forgiving format for a recording of this poor quality.Yes the music is great, but the sound cuts in and out and the video looks murky. Also, the stage lighting is so dim that you can barely see the horn section, the background singers, or the percussion players. As a result, the cameras focus strictly on what is happening at the front of the stage, basically just Fela and the dancers. It makes the whole experience feel flattened and two-dimensional. You start wondering just what is going on back there in the dark.Worth buying only as a historical artifact."
2,Being on DVD doesn't Help this weak sounding Fela Happening,"How they could ever rerelease this great ""video"" release of an obviously great Fela show with the same audio problems. Makes this an extreme rip off for lovers of not only Fela,but for what the format of DVD can do to clean up hurting analog releases. I recomend the 1984 festival DVD and hope for some quality in the archives to be released soon.The 81 DVD is for extreme Fela lovers only. Trust Me, the audio will bum you out........"
2,kinda good kinda bad,"I read the above reviews regarding the sound quality and thought ""I love Fela; I'm sure I'll enjoy it anyway."" So I bought it. Well, never having had the opportunity to see him live, I was happy to see him in action; however, the quality is so horrible I can't imagine watching it again. Not only is the sound muffled, but the camera operator constantly cuts away from what is interesting. There is one segment in particular in which Fela is really getting loose, dancing like some kind of karate rooster, and the camera keeps cutting to the friggin' audience. Man! I imagine if you're into Fela as much as I am, you'll probably wind up buying it anyway. No harm."
1,as bad as it can be,"There is absolutely nothing good about this DVD - the sound and picture are so bad that one can hardly judge the performance of the band and Fela Kuti (although I am very suspicious it was more than mediocre).I have over 20 Fela's albums, all are very good and will not keep this DVD for sure. I don't recommend watching it even for free.This is a lousy recorded VHS tape miserably transferred to DVD.I'll try to find something decent from Fela, he deserves it."
3,Just happy seeing in perform,"It was just nice to see him live. For somebody that understands what he was saying, an issue with strong language may arise.I have always liked Fela but certainly, a DVD of some of his older records may put things about him and what he stood for, in a brighter light.His performance of ""army arrangement"" was great apart from the begining where he went of the bend with strong language. The intoduction with prolonged intstrumental, in my view, did not help much. People who knew him always liked to hear him sing, in his own lingo- ""yab"". Not that great at first listening but you will get to love his performance after viewing the DVD many times over."
4,Fela Lives,This video did a great job of capturing a vibrant Fela Kuti at a concert in Paris. I would recomend this video for any fan of Fela or world music.
2,Very poor product despite a great show,Horrible mix and very poor images for an unbelievable and legendary performance in Paris I had the chance to attend.This video makes me angry !
1,Will not play in the US,"I really wanted to acquire this DVD, and thought the price was great, and it arrived very quickly. Only problem - it is a PAL disc, so if you are in Europe - wonderful. If not, it will not play in the US. The source provided a full red fund, so no complaints from that perspective."
5,Masterpiece,"The board game THE GAME OF LIFE gets a new meaning with this magnificent book. Is life a game? It could be a useful metaphor, and Lou Harry is extremely convincing in explaining how this board game can be used as a model for understanding and living life. Once we understand life as a game, the next step is to search for good game strategies. Harry does not going into the details of game theory, how a finite game always has a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium and such, but rather decides to handle those aspects in a more intuitive manner. Splendid. It should perhaps be noticed that Harry assumes that we know what the game board looks like and how the game is played, the mix of strategy and probability. In order to use the book for understanding the REAL game of life, it might be useful to buy a copy of the Hasbro game as well, as using the game as a model makes the theory in Harry's book even more easily accessible. This book is a masterpiece. Buy it now!!!"
5,Short and sweet,"A previous reviewer rated this book 1 star, commenting ""Nothing new"". I certainly disagree, both on the rating and on the need for a book to say something new to be good.It is indeed true that this book is not very spectacular in its revolutionary insights. But that's exactly what makes this book so good.It is a broad review of the perspective and the emotional world of a 2-year old. It helped me enormously understand what goes on in a 2-year old and how to approach one.The book is very broad and informative, it doesn't dwell on any topic for too long. The language is sharp and witty. And, not unimportant, the book is short.All in all, it's a great little gem. I've been recommending it to caregivers and parents."
2,Not adequate for fine woodworking.,"The face of the edge guide that touches the workpiece is a problem on the unit I got.It has two pieces, basically split vertically in half if the router is also vertical. One of my pieces is bent slightly towards the workpiece, or perhaps one piece is bent slightly away. It still works, but honestly is my most disappointing purchase as far as quality goes; not good for very accurate cutting."
4,Good buy!,"I bought this guide for a project where I needed to make some long routes on a screen. Even with three kids hanging on my legs and not looking at the instructions, I was able to get this thing on in five minutes. I practiced on one board and felt comfortable enough to take on the project, which was being done for my mom, so I was worried about screwing it up. But the guide was so easy to use I felt comfortable going after the project right away.Also, it is as solid as a rock. However, I've only given it four stars because my use with it has been limited, so I can't give it all five stars just yet. Still, I don't see anything going wrong as far as durability is concerned. I recommend this item highly."
2,Disappointed,"The edge guide is a flimsy design that is not easy to adjust in small increments. It works ok for a low powered machine, but I would not use it for routers two hp and above."
2,"Works, but poorly.","DeWalt 'asianizes' yet another product. As a somewhat advanced furniture maker this accessory will not hold up for me. The dust collector nozzle has already broken albeit it does not affect the performance of the guide. Not near as robust as the guide that come with Bosch routers, but it won't fit the Dewalt 621 plunge router which is perhaps the best plunge router on the street.The guide looks like it was stamped out of a chinese license plate. The guide works for now,which is about all I can say. If you want accuracy,durabiity,and value contact Pat Warner - google ""routerman""."
3,"Great product, if it was new","I opened the box to find that some one had used it, repacked it, and returned it. There was glue stains on the instructions and rods, the unit works very well, I just wish it was a new one"
1,Not for Woodworking,"Purchased this item as an extension to my router table and am very displeased. The Item was packaged sufficiently. The Directions were also sufficient. The main body is a stamped steel edge which is connected to the rails via a cast aluminum piece that needed to be finagled to accept the rails. The holes on the router base that accept the rails were too large, and the rails had lots of play until they were tightened. And the worst part of it all is the edge of the ""Router EDGE guide"" was not straight!! held up to a straight edge, there was a 1/16+ gap on one side, which would cause it to rock during the cut.This is not a tool for woodworking at any level and makes me consider getting rid of the router as well!!"
4,Well worth the money,I purhcased this a few weeks ago from Amazon. I played around on scrap while getting the hang of it. It is easy to setup and use. I used it making some fluted trim and the vac port worked ok when working near the edge but hooking the shop vac directly to the Dewalt plunge router worked better. All in all well worth the money.A fellow woodworker
3,Not Perfect - Too Much Flex,"The flex compromises the accuracy. This solution is probably OK for the weekend warrior, but if you make your living as a finish carpenter, you might want to look elsewhere for a more accurate solution. It is a shame since the DeWalt plunge router's base (model DW621) is smallish compared to other routers out there. It's overall stability would have benefited from a more stable edge guide. Some instructions included in the box would have been nice too!"
4,DeWalt router guide,"There really isn't that much to the product. It was shipped complete, installed easily, and does exactly what it was intended to do."
4,WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY,"I don't use it much because I have a router table but if you don't have a table or a very steady hand, it is a must to cut a straight line. I take pride in my work and this guide just improves the job. As I said before , I haven't used it enough yet to give an accurate review but I feel anyone would appreciate it especially if they don't have a good router table."
4,Decent Product,"It's a decent, tough little back-pack with enough inside pockets and space for everyday things. It's stuctures are large enough for some paperwork, but sometimes it falls a little short. There's a designated space to place a Radio/CD/Mp3 player and a 3.5mm audio jack extension to the shoulder sling. Another section on the outside for a water bottle or a small umbrella. It hangs comfortably off the right(only) shoulder and you can take it off/put it on by using the convenient clip in the middle instead of having to throw it around your head."
5,inspirational gospel,"I loved the messages to his songs. They are positive ones. Here's a good example. One of the songs is called, Count Your Blessings. the kind of songs you might sing in church. Others the listener might be familiar with are Rescue the Perishing; Shall We Gather At The River; and God Be With You. All the songs have either organ or piano accompaniment. Burl Ives has a very beautiful baritone voice. I think anyone who loves gospel music sung in the traditional manner that it was meant to be sung will love this album."
3,Lose the carbohydrates,"I found this diet to be similar to the Atkins diet, but with less fat allowance, which is a good thing. It's a proven fact now that carbs are our worst enemy, not moderate amounts of fat."
2,Some good information but distorted presentation.,"Dr. McCulley presents his case for homocystene as a risk factor in heart disease and there is some useful material here. However, he is so intent on convincing his audience that cholesterol is meaningless that he distorts the data. Several times he lumps the effects of cholesterol in the diet (probably of little importance) together with cholesterol in the bloodstream (shown to be important in hundreds of studies). In the end I decided that I wasn't sure that anything he said was not very biased. Heart disease is probably not a case of homocystene OR cholesterol but homocystene AND cholesterol. I hope all readers of this book will also read other sources such as Kowalski for a balanced presentation. Fortunately there are other sources of information on the importance of homocystene. Reader beware."
2,Not Worth The Money,"This book does a disservice for those who really want helpful information about diet.. Dr. McCully did not do himself any favors by allowing his daughter, Martha, a Fashion Magazine Beauty writer to co-author it.. just very badly written.. and it undermines his medical crediblity..Don't waste your time or money.. if you need advice.. go to a reputable medical web site...."
2,The problem/solution is more than a single factor,"As a surgeon who is averse to giving patients most medicines (""Heart Frauds"" and ""Cholesterol Myths"" are 2 of my favorite books), I nevertheless reject any uni-factorial ""cure"" for heart or most other diseases. It's no more appropriate to focus exclusively on homocysteine than on cholesterol. Human health and disease are related to a huge number of factors and we have an inkling of only a few of them. The only unequivocal 'truth' is that lifestyle modifications (Mediterranean-type eating rather than American fast-food and 'diets' + regular exercise [swimming, bicycling] + stress management + no smoking) are the best approaches to longterm health. The quick-fixes that Americans want don't work and are often toxic."
2,Too small,"Unless you have very small fingers, you'll have a hard time getting the balls tight with this rack. The small size also makes it difficult to remove without disrupting the balls. I switched back to using my standard 15 ball rack."
1,"Whatever you do, do NOT watch this ""film""","I can sum this movie up with one word. ""HUH?""One would think that a movie, especially a ""Western"" with Dwight Yoakam, Billy Bob Thornton, Peter Fonda, Bridgett Fonda and several other actors whom I can't think of right now, would be at least ""fair"". Not even close.Entire movie exhibited the most wooden, uninspired acting I believe it has ever been my displeasure to view. And what the hell an obviously gay retired general and his ""aide"" had to do with anything, I have no clue. And why his ""sidekick"" wore what appeared to be a skirt, I also have no clue.This is one of those movies you KNOW you should rewind and return after about five minutes, but keep watching, hoping it will get better or ultimately make sense. No such luck."
3,ok i guess,"This tool is way too under powered, if I push too hard i can stop it.The tool is very awkward feeling and seems is top-heavy, having a tendency to gouge the work.It is a good belt sander though for doing very light duty sanding, i wouldnt reccomened this sander for heavy stock removial, or re-finshing work.The bag in the front is nice but it screws up your whole grip, and it is very uncomfortable after long periods of use. If you do light work buy it if not by the porter cable or bosch."
1,My bad karma,"Bought the sander and used it for a couple of days for some moderate to light sanding on a bookcase I was building. Belt tracking was excellent, the dust collector was not very effective and it lifted off from the sander frame at times as I lifted the sander off the work piece.Day 3, disaster struck. After sanding for about 15 minutes, I put the sander down. Upon returning 30 minutes later, the motor completely siezed up, much to my surprise. Returned it to the store and bought a Bosch instead."
2,Disappointed with Dewalt,"I have had nothing but problems. While still under warranty, the switch went out. A month later it would not run. I took it in to repair and the cost was over $100.00. Now the frame that holds the front roller is broken. Repair cost nearly another $100.00. When working, it is a good sander. I am a home hoppy person and do not use my tools rough or on a daily basis. Did I get a lemon?"
2,Don't expect too much,"I am an occasional user. I've used my sander for approx 10 times. The motor burned up today. I was sanding 3 sheets of plywood with 60 grit paper, when all of a sudden it siezed up. Of couse I've had it longer than the warranty, but it should last under the conditions I use it. Will consider before buying Dewalt again. Also, the dust bag is a joke. It collects maybe 20% of your dust."
5,STRAIGHT UP ILL SHITE YO,This is an incredible cd. It blends classic hiphop elements with a new school flavor. GOOD STUFF!
3,HWA - True Hoez of RuthLess,This EP was pretty good int he production in that Cold 187um adds his G-Funk and CPO adds his distinctive voice! The girls give good vocal rhythms and good rhymes. On a scale of 1-10 I'd give this album a 6 because to me most production from RUTHLESS artist are pretty good. This EP came out in 1994 and is a pretty good album for RUTHLESS COLLECTORS. The inserts of the girls is HOT also!
4,loved these girls back in the day,"yeah this is how I like my women hypersexual, loose not scared to get down with men and other women who like to get paid reminds me of my wild sex parties this is orgy music along with 2 live crew and blowfly sao if youb wanna get 2 girls in the bed and play jack tripper I recommend both hwa albums."
4,directly from a 5 year old...............,"""........I like it because he comes off the motorcycle, so you get 2 things, not just one"". The motorcycle is cool because it doesn't fall down like other motorcycles and it has a ramrod-type of thing that snaps out when you push the button. Kids love those kinds of things. Rescue Heroes are just great, not just from a kids perspective, but from a parents perspectives because they do teach kids to help others and not just by catching bad guys with guns. And all the kids I know seem to just love them."
5,"""Just is"" fun!!","My son LOVES this motorcycle. The fact that it stands alone is wonderful. My son has the best time lining up blocks and then knocking them over with the bikes ""road block buster"". It's proven to be a favorite rescue hero vehicle over and over."
4,Great little pack,"Great little pack of Blade. Like tools, do not hesitate to buy quality, you will win on the long run.Another good package from Dewalt.Didier"
4,Unique and original,"This book is original. I picked this book up hoping that it would be as good a read as Snow Crash was. What I found was a jewel. I was hooked from page one and found myself totally amazed that any writer could come up with such an amazing, original work. Please read this book, you won't be disappointed."
5,"LOVE IT OR HATE IT, IT IS THE FUTURE FOLKS...","Despite the comments about the weak (supposedly) ending, this book reflects the reality of the future as accurately as anyone can without seeing it firsthand. All the snide remarks about the plot, or the characters, or the ""sexual undertones"" are simply out of touch with reality. Anyone who insists that it is implausible because of ""past socioeconomic trends"" does not fully grasp the concept that one cannot use the past to predict the influence of a COMPLETELY NEW AND REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY on the world. Those that thought the ideas were distasteful are frightened by change. Get over it. This book is profound. Read it. Not much more needs be said. Oh, and if you were one of those who had the audacity to review it after only reading 50 pages, go back to your bloody Dick and Jane readers."
5,Anyone who doesn't like this is on crack!,"Stephenson is a brilliant writer who has once again drawn readers into an entirely new world of his own creation, abundant with diverse cultures, well-developed characters, interesting technology, and originality. A must read!"
5,"A hilarious, fast-paced heartbreaker","Stephenson really knows how to write relevant science fiction. The Diamond Age hits hard in a time when governments are questioning their role in social services for people and when nationalism isn't what it used to be. The world presented in The Diamond Age is tragic, horrible and wonderous, forcing you to continue reading, eating up the hilarity and absurdity laced throughout. Nell, a young girl caught in a multi-phyle chase over her Primer, is the embodyment of Generation X ideals. She's a brilliant slacker, addicted to her information source, learning only for the sake of consumption. But her will to live is overwhelming, giving us the ride of a lifetime through the Shanghi of the future. Stephenson is a master writer of amusing cyberthrillers, and is definetly an author to watch out for"
4,"Creative, engrossing sci-fi","I love this book. I am reading it for the second time, this time as a book on tape. I read Stephenson's Snow Crash first and then found Diamond Age. It's story is an imaginative and somehow eerily realistic vision of the future. There's nothing that seems too far-fetched in terms of the societies or ""claves"" as he calls them are defined. The story is about a young girl who comes across an interactive book that saves her from a harsh and poverty stricken life. As someone who came from a less than ""Beaver Cleaver"" family where you hit first and ask questions later I know just how transformative and life saving books can be. The ""young girl's primer"" does it for Nell one of the main characters in this story. I am actually enjoying it more the second time around. Maybe it is the times we live in."
3,Went downhill,Started out as a 5 star for me then became average. The first half of the book where the author sets down the foundations of nanotechnology was great. The second half got weird with strange vision quests and vague references to the Seed. The ending seemed to be just tacked on so the author could finish. It went no where.
4,Neal Stephenson - Visionary.,"I first read ""Snow Crash"" around a year ago, and couldn't put it down. I've since read it several times more. I then decided to read ""The Diamond Age"" and, as ""Snow Crash"", it has transformed my life. The technology is not unbelievable (although it should never be totally within view!), and the characters are amazingly written. Nell is one of the best characters I've ever read, and Stephenson got me to really care about her. My only criticisms are about the ending (another 100 or so pages would have helped!), and that sometimes it was difficult working out how much time had passed. But still, ""The Diamond Age"" was compulsive reading, and I will be reading it again very soon."
4,Well-written but dangerously flawed in its premise!,"Stephenson is an excellent writer with a good understanding of the scientific subject matter, but he buys into Penrose's anti-AI rhetoric, turning this book into a subtle polemic against the logical possibility of strong AI. I could only recommend this book if it is taken concurently with an antidote to its philosophical poison. One such antidote is Daniel C. Dennett's very clear and readable _Consciousness Explained_. Bottom line: read this book as fantasy, not science."
2,Interesting Ideas But Poor Plot,"The ideas in this book are very interesting in terms of the interactive storybook as well as other nanotechnology references. The bad thing is, as with too many hard sci-fi stories, the characterizations are paper thin. I wound up not caring about any of the characters except the little girl but her story is poorly intertwined with the others subplots. The novel just meanders along and completely loses direction at the end. I can't honestly tell you what the point of the book was. Interesting science ideas don't mean anything in a weak plot."
4,Victorians and Street Urchins....wonder what happens next...,"This was the best book I've read since Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials Trilogy's first books. The Sci-Fi books are my domain, but this guy writes them like no other. His weaves the technology into everyday instances. A lot like us talking about some computer virus, except this one slices you up into fish bait. Definately not for young children... Still, the character interaction, and how he flips from person to person... I have to meet this guy. You are one of my favs Neal!"
2,"Brilliant ideas, little suspense","A lot of people read SF primarily for the ideas, and I'd argue there is no better fiction for that purpose. Add at least two stars to this review if you are an 'ideas' reader, because Stephenson has more ideas than the next five successful SF writers combined.For me, though, the lack of suspense, the lack of absorbing characters, and the lack of story momentum led me to abandon this book after I had dutifully slogged through more than half of it.Maybe it picks up dramatically near the end, but frankly, at this point, I just felt my reading time would be better spent elsewhere.It would be interesting to see Neal Stephenson team up with a strongly character-based SF luminary for a collaboration."
4,Utopia or Dystopia?,"This book was definitely a good read. The story was entertaining and like Snow Crash, the world that it took place in was as interesting as the plot itself. I honestly couldn't tell you if the future shown in this book is a utopia or a dystopia. Stephenson makes unique predictions on the future of technology, focusing on its impact on the everyday lives of normal people. Unfortunately, like Snow Crash the ending was weak. It left the reader unclear exactly where everything stood and in some cases what was going on."
4,Remarkable,"Neal Stephenson has created a remarkable vision of the future. It would be enough to read about how nanotechnology changes the way people live in the Diamond Age, and probably more than one could ask for to have a fully realized, bravura description of the remarkable society in this tale of the distant future. But the truly remarkable part of this novel is the character of Nell, the destitute young girl who obtains a copy of the ""Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.""We are able to watch Nell as she acquires knowledge, strength and wisdom. And we root for her every step of the way.I take away one star because I found the end of the novel disappointing (maybe I just didn't want it to be over). The politics get a bit complex, and the ending comes quite abruptly.That said, I was absolutely lost in ""The Diamond Age."" I stole every available minute to read as much as I could. It is a lyrical, transcendent novel that I would recommend to anyone."
4,"Wonderful, Post-Cyberpunk","Just discovered Neal Stephenson. Where the heck have I been? This book starts out looking like a typical cyberpunk story, but he pulls that rug out from under you very quickly. He pulls a lot of rugs out by the end of it, nothing goes quite like you'd expect. Like Cryptonomicon and Snow Crash, a lot of this takes place in some form of cyberspace, and again he makes it his own and you want to go explore with him. And you want to know his people, good and bad.There is humor that hits you broadside in his writing, although it isn't a comedic book by any means.My one even sort of negative comment is about the ending, which is abrupt. I understand it is a common complaint, and I see that he has addressed it on his web site by saying something like, ""They end the way I want them to."" Got to give the guy credit for that.In any case, I highly recommend this book."
5,Original and thought provoking,"Finally a story with some originality! The story of Nell and her journey through this magical world is compelling and thought provoking. The writing is excellent and if I have a complaint it's only that this is one of those books I didn't want to end, ever, so the ending disappointed me. It's made an incredible impression, I still think of the story often years later and have re-read the book several times. It's always nice to see something that makes you believe art isn't dead, yet."
2,Boring rant.,Just a boring trippy rant. The one night I was tipsy and read it was the only time I really enjoyed the second half of the book. First half was promising though.
1,"Starts strong, ends stupid and misanthropic","I was drawn into this book in the beginning by the well-drawn characters and humor, and then it seemed like the author hit deadline or something and went for the cheap sexual wrap-up. The second half of the book was a real disappointment - and it made my husband more sick than myself. Avoid it."
5,When will Stephenson write more?,"The Diamond Age is a more sophisticated, more challenging and more rewarding book than Snow Crash (which was a fantastic first novel). Stephenson is an enormous talent - anyone desperate for more from him while we await his next book should read the 10,000-word travelogue he wrote in the December 1996 issue of Wired. It is as different from his novels as they are from each other, but a joy to read nonetheless. Anyone with no interest in technology will hate it."
5,Loved it,"I loved this book. I have it in audiobook form and I'm listening to it on my commute (again) and hoping for traffic jams so I can listen longer.It has wonderful characters and the most amazing ideas. I loved Snow Crash, too, but this book was more insightful, if less adventurous. It's in my Top 20. Along with the Dune series and everything by William Gibson."
3,"If you're looking for another Snow Crash, this may not be it","I saw Neal Stepheson on ZDTV talking about his newest book. Then I went to look at reviews of his books. Snow Crash looked interesting, so I purchased it. I read it in 2 weeks on my honeymoon. It was the best book I have ever read.Then, with enthusiasm I purchased Diamond Age. I started reading it and the first chapter I felt back in the atmosphere of Snow Crash. The next chapters following that faded quickly and I was disapointed.If I had read this first, I would have liked it much better, but I was spoiled. It was a good book, but far from a second Snow Crash."
3,Great story... until it falls apart.,"I bought this book after reading ""Snow Crash"", which I thought was a really good book. It was with this expectations that I started reading ""The Diamond Age."" I loved the way he built upon the girl Nell, and how the story unfolded. Until around the middle of the book, when it gave me the impression that I was reading two or three different books at the same time. I was very disappointed by this (not to mention the ending). Buy this book if you like to change the channel in your TV every 5 seconds, but don't buy it if you like a good, solid story from start to end."
1,Kindle version MUST be edited,"I am positive that this book is a masterwork of science fiction that readers have come to expect from Stephenson, but I must submit this one star review in the hope that the Kindle version of the book gets some desperately needed attention from an editor. There are so many typographical errors in this book that, having read roughly halfway through, I have gotten fed up to the point of having put my Kindle down mid-sentence on more than one occasion. These are mostly scanning errors - the words ""man,"" ""men"" and ""mat"" appear so often in the place of ""than,"" ""then"" and ""that,"" that I have begun to make the corrections automatically as I read. Is it really so much to ask that someone go through and bring this product to the level that one would expect from a printed book? Sorry I couldn't review this book for its obvious merits as a great work of storytelling, but I just can't get over how horrible it is to read this unfinished garbage on the Kindle."
1,pseudo intellectual garbage,"It is disconcering to find, that like in the world of art, the incomprehensible is seen as denoting a fine work. This read was tantamount to having a bad acid trip. The author has no concept of science and attempts to so confuse the reader that the reader is supposed to see greatness in a work that is merely jejune."
1,Save Yourself Time! Do Not Read This Book,"I am a deep lover of Science Fiction. This book was a major disappointment, a waste of time, and can be categorized as pure goobly-gook! I wanted to like this book, but it was full of maddening obessive verbriage. The first 400 pages of the book was hyper-reflixive technology-speak. There existed no character development that emboided humaness nor humanity. I felt I should have been paid for enduring the torture involved in sticking with the book until the end. What a labor of false hope. At least the Science Fiction works of Paolo Bagigalupi's (Pump Six) and Brandon Sanderson's (The Hero of Ages) embraces eternal themes, philosophy and caringiness in their essence. I am so angry at myself for being fooled into reading this obessive junk."
1,I hope I can save you,"There is a bit to be encouraged about after reading this book. This book demonstrates that you need absolutely no talent, abilities, or any skill what-so-ever in wrting to become a published author. It appears Bantam Spectra will publish any piece of trash you send them. Be warned, delete your browse history, turn off your computer, take a cold shower, go for a long walk, just do not read this book. I just hope I can prevent someone else from suffering the same fate that I did. You have been warned."
3,"Great ideas, but not the greatest book...","The ideas and technology in this book are fascinating. The characters are, for the most part, engaging. I found myself enjoying parts of the novel greatly. But the way characters seemed to just drift out of importance was frustrating. When I finished reading, I nearly threw the book across the room. It seems that he wanted the book to be under 400 pages, so when he reached the bottom of page 399, he just stopped writing. I ended up feeling like he didn't care about the story or the characters. I really enjoyed the ideas presented, but the author's cavalier attitude towards storytelling left a bad taste in my mouth."
5,The Diamond Age,I think that it was a wonderful book and I would like to find out more about any other books that comes out.
2,Could have been better,Stephenson crams lots of neat tidbits of ideas in this hi-tech fantasy but fails to explore most of them and the book bogs down in a slow-to-develop and not very interesting plot. Occasional flashes of brilliance kept me turning the page hoping this book would take off but it kept getting slower and slower and I was glad when I reached the last page that I didn't have to read it anymore.
4,What?,"Having devoured with great satisfaction everything Stephenson I could get my teeth into, I think I can be classified as a true fan. Diamond Age, however, left me wondering if the master was pushed into publication prematurely here. The unanswered questions, intriguing as they are, become pure frustration when answers are not forthcoming. I hope there a sequel in the works that will fill in the gaps."
5,Brilliant.,"This book is so awe-inspiringly complex, original in its conception, beautifully crafted and intelligent, it ranks in the top ten books I have ever read, even though the ending is, well, somewhat lackluster in comparison."
5,How to raise your daughter right.,"I've read and enjoyed most of Neal Stephenson's books, including The Big U. This is my favorite. As the father of a daughter, this book really struck home. My wife and I have often thought about what would allow her to grow up to be the best person possible. Neal Stephenson has a daughter and has done some soul searching in this direction as well. Diamond Age is a book that will stay with you far after you read it; I read it over a year ago and I continue to reflect upon some of the ideas it introduced. I recommend that you read it."
2,Nano what?,"I have heard good things about Stephenson so I decided to give this book a chance. For only the second time in my life I was unable to finish the book. The characters were utterly uncompelling. His ideas about the future are half-baked. They go against not only common sense but the socio-economic trends of the past few centuries. Also his treatment of nanotech was so superficial and poorly done that it made me laugh out loud. Maybe his other books are great, but this one sure isn't."
3,The World-building Makes It Worth the Read,"Actually 3.5 stars.If you're looking for a vividly crafted world, this is the story for you. If you're looking for characters you can connect with, that will stay with you for a long time, this isn't that read. For me, the world-building makes it worthwhile. It's fantastic & possibly that is part of the reason the characters felt rather flat. Stephenson is truly gifted at giving sense of place & surroundings. It was it's own character, for me & I truly didn't want to leave.There are quite a few parts that feel slow & drag a bit but again, I think it's the characters & a feeling that you're just putting in time with them to get through it all. The ending felt a bit abrupt & left me wanting an epilogue. I suppose I just wasn't quite ready to leave this world behind. I think that's pretty good, all things considered."
3,Interesting but slow...,"Especially when compared to Stephensen's ""Snow Crash"" that lead me to this book. Though thought provoking and, once again, full of interesting ideas and building a neat reality, The Diamond Age never really did it for me. In fact, I believe my bookmark still sits 36 pages from the end. My not is more related to ADD than the book's quality; for those who can tolerate a slightly slower pace, you should find the story and ideas quite entertaining. Taking place in a harsh and advanced future, The Diamond Age tells the story of a yound, female, ""have-not"", who has, through coincidence, some to own an incredible tool to lead the child's development."
5,Awesome book!,"Amazing read, and an amazing vision of a very possible future. Mr. Stephenson has not only a tremendous talent for a unique turn of phrase, but he couples this with a stunningly original yet intricately detailed and depthful imagination. Well done, Sir! I am giving this book to friends as gifts, because it has moved me so deeply. I highly recommend this book!"
2,Weak ending,"All that and a weak ending? This is the second Neal Stephenson book I've read, the other being Snow Crash. Both were great reads for the first 3/4's of the book, then it is as if Neal got tired and ended the book. It ended inconclusive and wanting. I wouldn't recommend."
3,Not as good as Snow Crash,"I was very disappointed with this book.Neil Stephenson has written some truly great novels, Zodac for one, Snowcrash for another. This one, however, left a bad taste in my mouth. The characters were not terribly well developed, but, I thought the world itself, the atmosphere, was wonderful. The ending just left me hanging and wondering where the other half of the book went. Perhaps he's planning a sequal. If he is, then I'll change my rating to about an 8, if he does not, then, I'm afraid I'll have to leave it at a five.I suggest go read Zodiac. It's a thriller, and a lot of fun."
4,A brilliant mind goes awry...,"In this case, I mean Neil Stephenson's mind! :^) When I read this book for the first time, I was stuck. I couldn't put it down, but it irritated me in so many little ways that I had a major dilemma. It was not all sweetness and light. It was not a romping adventure in CyberSpace, as some editors and critics would like you to think. It was a very provocative conduit for a lot of thinking, and for that I am very grateful to Neil Stephenson. This book is about the power of the mind, and the power of attachments. It is definitely worth the read. Buy it"
5,Cyber cool,"I did not think I'd like this book. I read the first couple chapters slowly ...over a few weeks...until I was able to recognize the book's potential for great reading. This book is science fiction: with elements of mystery, erotica, thriller, romance, commentary, and good ol' fashioned story telling.The plot eventually weaves together a number of seemingly dissimilar plot threads and keeps you byting your nails to the very end. (I had to chew plenty of gum to keep from devouring my nuckles.)Interactive books, nanochips, virtual reality made possible by live actors, crumbling governments, limitless resources, rich and poor, victorian and thoroughly modern, the richness of the book is unbelievable.If you wish to invest your time to read a quality book, this is it. Get ready to discard your old notions of story and future! Fans of cyberpunk writer Gibson will enjoy this book a great deal."
2,Grrrrrrr!,"Some (many in fact) great ideas and an intricate backdrop to the story. Should have been brilliant.However, that aside, the book doesn't ""end"" it just stops! I spent 20 minutes trying to work out if this unanticipated termination was caused by a bug in the kindle the ending was so abrupt.Imagine you've just waded through The Lord of the Rings but, just as Frodo and Sam reach the crags of doom, Tolkien had written: ""And then they all went home for tea"" you'd feel much the way I do now. I know it won a load of awards but it could have been so much better. Frankly I feel cheated"
3,I'm tempted to say 2 & 1/2 but recommend it with caveats,"I came to this book after Cryptonomicon which I enjoyed, in fact read it over just a few days as i couldn't put it down. This depite some slow passages, lapses and absurd coincidences in plot, and a certain shallowness. It is however engaging and pulls you in. Diamond Age shares the same qualities and flaws as well as a ridiculously slapdash ending. THe flaws in fact are much more pronounced. The treatment of nanotech is glitzy and shallow, the MTV vision of nanotech. Additionally if you're the kind of reader who can't stand laughable illogic in the story and setting this book is perhaps not for you. However if you can look beyond the occassionally stunted tress the view of the forest is worth it. The ending is both too neat and incomplete and in thus unsastifying, though I must say the mental pictures it inspires are vivid, epic and incredible. This book would make wonderful anime. My advice read it, option the rights."
3,"Interesting premise, poor execution","The Diamond Age is one of those books that starts great, and ends extremely poorly. There are basically two books here, divided nicely by Stephenson into parts 1&2. Part 1 is great. He builds some interesting characters, living in a fascinating framework. Part 2, unfortunately, doesn't live up to the premises set in the first part. Characters come and go, seemingly randomly. Groups of people form strange ""human computers"". Stories in the ""Primer"" end up turning into a long diatribe on computing theory, rather than something that would be expected to help a young girl grow.Unfortunately, this seems to be a problem that Stephenson has. He can create these incredible worlds and premises, but his ability to take them to a good conclusion is poor. Cryptonomicon, in my opinion, suffers from much the same problem. It was a great trip, but when it finished, you realized that you hadn't really gone anyplace."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Firstly, it is not really possible for him to top Snow Crash, so I couldn't expect that. I did only find the Diamond Age to be average.A corporate underling takes a supercomputer in the form of a book to educate his daughter to see beyond the strictures of the society that she has been raised iin. He is a nanoengineer, so some exploration of building by nanomachines is present."
1,Reading binary code is slightly less interesting.,"Mr. Stephenson is a technological visionary. He describes vividly a possible future. But description is his downfall...it drags on and on and on with little concern for plot or characterization. Admittedly I could only stomach the first 100 pages before I had to give it up. It simply wasn't making a whole lot of sense...and I graduated with a minor in computer programming. Frankly, I think Stephenson is one of those authors where people think it's cool to say they read, like they're smarter than the rest of us. Stephenson is very bright, but he's not a writer. A writer, specifically sci-fi writing, incorporates compelling characters and stories with technology. Stephenson nails 1 out of three. If he can get the other two down, if even in small measure, he'd be a stunning writer."
5,"Good condition, shipping faster than expected",The price was very competitive without excessive shipping costs. Porduct arrived sooner than expected in excellent condition.
1,slow moving disapoinment,"I put this book down after about 50 pages and did not pick it up again. After reading the triumphant ""Snowcrash"" I had high hopes for this next novel, only to feel robbed of the money I spent on it. Slow moving with poor character development, I didn't care what happened to anyone in the story, nor did I want to find out what happened in the end, much less the very next paragraph. All of the parts I read, reminded me of the boring bits of ""Snowcrash"" without the prospect of excitment or gripping story telling. I can't even recommend buying this book used, if you must read it, then borrow and assure your friend, that it will be returned, and the last pages will still never have been read."
1,yecch,"I agree with the people who said this book started out great and went downhill. Way, way downhill. I didn't understand the majority of what happened in the second half of the book, and what I did vaguely understand, I found utterly ridiculous. I wish I could see this book through the eyes of the people who thought it was terrific!"
1,"I would give it 0 stars, but you won't allow me.","Neal Stephenson is a brilliant mind, but got a little too mixed up with Jolt (perhaps). I was reading this book, and had a jolly good time, until I got to ""Part Deux"", and then I said to myself, ""this guy sucks. He has completely run out of new ideas, and is willing to stake his reputation for a quick buck to finish this book (which had such promise in the beginning) with such loathsome images and ideas not pertaining to anything."
2,Fantasy/Scifi,I read science fiction because I like to speculate on possible futures. Diamond Age seems more like a fantasy novel to me. I do not believe nano-technology will ever be developed to the extent protrayed in the book.
5,Awesome book,This and Snowcrash in my opinion are his best books. I have read both of them a few times and continue to find things that I have missed. Stephenson's writing style is more at home in the not-quite reality in this and Snowcrash. Cryptonomicon is good but these are much better. If you like cyberpunk or nanotech-oriented scifi then this is a great book to read.
3,Doesn't live up to its potential,"The story moved rather nicely for the first half. Set in a great milleau, the plot went one way and I went the other and was left thinking, ""Uh, what exactly is going on here and how did I miss it?""If only there was a way to have the author redo the latter half, the book might have lived up to the potential so evident in its beginning.Not a waste of time, but frustrating in its failures."
5,Holy Cow!,"There's no way this book can be summarised well without being an act of blasphemy. There are characters who are moral without being stuffy. There are characters who are less inclined to morality, while remaining human and personal."
3,Still interesting,"This is my least favorite Neal Stephenson book, but even a second rate Stephenson book bears some fascinating ideas. In the book, an ultra high technology manual for young ladies is created for the richest of grand daughters, and stolen for the tech writer's daughter. Along the way, the poorest of the poor receives a copy. I didn't enjoy the tracts of the writing of the manual, but these are easily enough to skip. The views of the futuristic China and the various clans designated to contain the world, we're breathtaking. I am a sucker for a trip to another world and Stephenson does this the best."
2,beautifully written but ultimately unsatisfying,"The writing is sublime, the premise intriguing, but in the long run this novel just doesn't deliever. Nell, the heroine, is wonderfully drawn but then, for reasons known only to the author, squanders all her years with the Primer for a job in a brothel. And what's with the little girls army? That just struck me as improbable and silly. I also didn't understand the Drummers or what Miranda is doing with them at the end. The endless indepth nanotech discussion and descriptions will delight anyone who is interested in this subject but it makes for boring reading if you're not."
3,Not recommended,"I barely, just barely, managed to finish this book. But since I did, I'll give it three stars.The book is divided into two parts, each approximately one half of the whole. If I could award two different ratings to those two halves, I'd give 5 stars to the first and 1 star to second. The reading experience went from one that could be described as a ""real page turner"" to one in which I found myself skipping entire paragraphs at a time to one in which I literally had to force myself to finish, as if it were required reading for a college class. The last quarter of the novel was about as enjoyable as the final five miles of a marathon... painful to the point of collapse, with every nerve in your body screaming to just give it up, but after making it that far you'd feel foolish for not getting to the finish line. So I did.No..not recommended at all."
3,Kindle Edition,"The Kindle edition seems to have not been proof read, there are numerous spelling mistakes often with the very same words. Although the story is good it seems to read like an early draft the pieces of the story do not seem to fit tightly together. Almost as if the author strung some short stories into one; that and the spelling mistakes prevent one from being fully immerged in the story."
4,Life doesn't end neatly -,"Good story, great read. Takes some flexibility to follow all the story lines, but the skein of the stories actually shows part of the social commentary sewn through the book. If you're looking for brain candy, just read the story: if you're looking for purpose in your books, this is a good reflection of some of the best and some of the worst motivations of mankind. It's not neat and it's not pretty and it's not complete: but like life it hangs together in a messy mass, has it's own beauty and is much more than it seems. This story can make you think and can make you re-evaluate your motivations and your place in life."
2,"Great first half, poor finish.","Like _Snow Crash_, _The Diamond Age_ is populated with wonderful characters, some of whom we have the privilege to see growing up. But the book loses something once the characters have grown up, as though the training they are given in order to be smoothly assimilated into the elite of society requires instead that they somehow dominate--even subjugate--that group.The concept at the core of the book--the Primer--is a bit reminiscent of Ender's desk in Orson Scott Card's seminal _Ender's Game_, but is handled in a fairly original way.Though I was completely enthralled its first half, this book--much like Gibson and Sterling's _The Difference Engine_--fails to capitalize on its finest ideas."
2,"A long, dreary road to a salvageable ending","After reading Cryptonomicon and Snow Crash, I jumped right into Diamond Age with enthusiasm. Based on those two books, I felt that this author could not possible write anything short of outstanding. How wrong I was!Diamond Age began with pathetically uninteresting characters in a future that makes me want to run off and live in the woods. I know that Stephenson likes to paint dreary pictures of the future in which technology does not solve all our problems, but it is the ridiculous cultural setting as well as the tech that ruins this book.The book is waaaay too long, incorporating about 100 times more of the Primer than is necessary to make the story interesting. I must say that he does salvage it somewhat in the end, with an interesting finish."
2,Tripe of nearly the worst sort,"Another long, wandering tale, poorly thought out and very unimaginative. The clumsy ending just confirms the reader's worst fears. However the future turns out, it definitely WON'T be anything like this ""cyberpunk meets The Sand Pebbles"". The author has heard of molecular nanotechnology, but can't see past the simplest, most obvious implications. The rest of the book is the same: name dropping, but no real information or knowledge to prop up the boring characters in their uninteresting lives. The author can't even define hypocrisy, which may explain how he had the gall to foist this rag on an already suffering public"
5,The best modern science fiction novel I've ever read!,"If you like science fiction, you must read The Diamond Age. I tend to prefer pre-""cyberpunk"" stuff myself (all that decadence gets a bit tiresome for a lover of beauty such as myself), but I will long remember TDA as one of my all-time favorite novels. As a political and moral conservative, I was intrigued by the prominence of the neo-Victorian phyle and can't help but wonder if Steaphenson isn't trying to say something about contemporary hedonistic mores and the harm they may bring to the societies which embrace them. Libertarian sci-fi fans of the Heinlein/Van Vogt/L. Neil Smith variety may find reason here to rejoice"
2,A mix of marvellous ideas that disappointed as a whole,"Having heard only positive reports of Stephenson's work (especially ""Snow Crash"") I expected interesting ideas and a good story when I picked up ""Diamond Age."" I found the former, but not the latter.The world setting of the story was quite novel, and had great potential. The concept of an interactive educational tool, completely self-customizing for the needs of its user was another attendtion grabber. Besides the technological marvels and the admittedly excellent characterization, the plot was,alas, quite weak. The introduction of unexpected elements ('the Seed'??!) seemed a markedly artificial means of enlivening the story, and the actual conclusion itself was quite unsatisfying.Overall, the book failed to come anywhere near my expectations of a book from the well-recommended Neil Stephenson."
3,"So, so...","Okay, so I'm a big Khan Academy fan and read an article on Sal Khan where I think he said he liked this book. Bought it out of curiosity because I needed a new light fiction read. Hasn't grabbed me."
2,What a let down after reading Snow Crash....,I was very disappointed when I started reading this book. It is way to surreal for me. I have really enjoyed all his other books. Snow Crash was first rate and Zodiac made me want to be an eco-warrior but this book...OY.....I couldn't even finish it.
3,Shows Stephenson's strengths and weaknesses,"Typical Stephenson strengths: ideas. Lots of them. Great ones. They come at you like bullets.Typical Stephenson weaknesses: plot, as in ""lack of."" The story stops (not ""ends,"" ""stops"") two-thirds of the way through the book. It's less coherent than _Snow Crash_, Stephenson's (outstanding) previous book.How this book works for you depends on how you feel about that tradeoff."
1,Appalling audiobook,I can't finish the Audible audiobook version: the recording quality is distractingly bad. Was there some artistic reason for recording the entire book in tinny monaural that sounds as though it was recorded through a 1968-era telephone speaker?
4,A Compelling Vision of the Future,"I still look to Neal Stephenson to see a particularly interesting technical, cultural, and social version of ourselves. The sex feels gratuitous at times."
5,More like Snowcrash,"Stephenson writes great stuff and this is no exception. This is very similar to world of snowcrash and in the style of snowcrash and the present tense of cryptinomicon. Pretty soon, hollywood is going to discover that Stephenson's works will be the same screen gold that Philip K Dick is, so read it before the blockbuster.Similar to snowcrash, the world as we know it is over. Nanotech reigns supreme. Nation states are less defined by geography than ideology. As one man tries to secure a future in an uncertain world for his daughter, a chance robbery changes the course of the world. The way the structure and writing change with the plot subtly pulls you in and reinforces the message. A great story line and well written. You wont be disappointed."
1,Left Me Bored and Hungry,"Though Stephenson has some titillating fantasies about nanotech to share, they fail to overcome the lack of a compelling plot. Usually I can't put a good book down. This one I found hard to plod through. The story finally gelled and became somewhat interesting about 2/3 of the way through the book, but even then it never really grabbed me. It seemed as though Stephenson relied on imaginative sound bites of future tech to carry the book, while the story wandered around and really went nowhere.Two thumbs down. I usually pass on my favorite reads to a good friend. I wouldn't waste his time on this one."
1,"Stephenson has imagination, but no craft","Imangining interesting gadgets and how they might affect society are his only greatness. He does not understand story, and he does not understand people.If he learns the craft of story, he may yet be great. Until then he's an interesting might-have-been."
1,Total crap,"Snow Crash was brilliant, this story was pathetic and poorly put together. There is no point to the majority of what happens in this novel and the ramblings of the author could have easily been cut in half. Worse still, all the possibly interesting contents -- Hackworth's story, Dr. X, CryptNet -- weren't flushed out and instead ignored in this tale about nothing. A war happens at the end, unexplored and for no purpose to the plot. Read a different novel, as this one isn't worth your time. I want the time I spent on it back."
2,"Good isolated ideas, worst novel I had ever read","I forced myself to read to the end of the book because of the good critic the book has. The end of the novel was the ""Best part"" in the sense that the pain of reading had finnaly come to an end.Then I started ""Snow Crash"" (god knows why) and I couldn get past the 4th chapter: ""a super hacker that does pizza deliveries and if he doesnt reach the destination in X minutes he get killed?...And the mafia rules the pizza biz?"". I HAD to stop reading, I felt stupid...Neil Stephenson is the worst writer in have ever read in my life. I am cleary stating all this because these reviews can really be misleading. I have to admit that he has some brilliant ideas like the nanotech world, but save me all the rest of the story.To the ones that didn't like this book I recomend them to take a look at ""Hyperion"" or ""RAMA"" (for hard sci-fi) and ""The Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy"" (for fun sci-fi) and the good old Neuromancer and secuels (for cyberpunk csi-fi)."
1,Ugh! What a waste of 8 hours!,"When I picked up this book, I was hoping that it wasn't as confusing and as hard to follow as William Gibson's Neuromancer. I was pleasantly engaged by the first half of the book. Wonderful world building, attention to detail, and captivating characters. Unfortunately, it went downhill from there.After the halfway point, the book lost what little semblance of a plot it had to begin with. There seemed to be no motivation behind the characters actions. We seem to just be looking in on segments of peoples' lives with no ultimate goal in mind. At the end, there was no climax and no resolution. It was as if Mr. Stephenson couldn't figure out how to finish the book and so just stopped writing at the end of a random chapter. I finished the last page and, literally, asked myself, ""What the hell was that! "" I felt like Mr. Stephenson had just wasted 8 hours of my life. What a disappointment!"
4,Stunning,"Having read Snow crash already, I picked up the Diamond Age with no hesitation. I knew I would be in for a rip-roaring good story that would teach and entertain me at the same time. I was not disappointed. Stephenson's knack for incorporating the details of his obviously extensive research without coming off as a pedagogue is unparalleled. The book falls short of five stars for its ending, though, which seems rushed compared to the attention to detail given the rest of the novel. Nevertheless, that's a small quibble for a novel by which I was consistently challenged -- and rewarded for the effort. When it was finished, I was a bit saddened because this was one of those rare novels I wanted to spend more time with when it had come round to its conclusion. Incidentally, the cover art on the British edition is much better than what's shown here."
5,Can't wait for his new book,I read this book 2 years ago and I still think about it. It is a book of ideas and isn't like Snow Crash (I also enjoyed it). Wish I had as much imagination as Stepheson.
5,NEAL!!! PLEASE LISTEN TO US!!!,"They're all right. The ending stinks.The only reason I'm commenting is that I hope it will sink in when so many of us say it. The worst ending of any quality book I know.The incredible thing is that we all hate the ending but love the book. That really says something.Transcendant! A brand new sci-fi sub-genre.And hey...Neal! Drop us a line, we'd love to know...was it the deadline, the editor, or did you just get bored?"
5,"Though Criticized, Diamond Age is still a gem","Crtics of this book, most notably Kirkus Reviews, have cited the ""vainglorius"" style and labyrnithine plot as negative aspects of an otherwise compelling book. I would describe them rather as assets; I found the style flexible and usually appropriate, both reflecting the sensibilities of the Neo-Victorian protagonists of the novel and providing the reader with gorgeous imagery and metaphor. The plot, though complex and ambigous, is compelling; as Constable Moore says to Nell towards the end of the tale, the ability to deal with this ambivalence is a mark of intelligence. Must the author do everything for us? I think that the open ended, freely interpretable nature of this book is one of its greatest strengths."
1,not easy as ads says,Takes two hands too pull the arrow out with your knee aganist it. After pulling several out your fingers starts to hurt because you have to grip so hard. I don't and will not recommend this target. Jack
4,Well done techno,"For the uninitiated, the task of finding a suitable techno CD is daunting. For the people who spend hours scouring CD bins hoping to find something above the standard four-beat-boom-boom-fare of electronic music, this CD is like an oasis in a desert. It embraces all that is wonderful about electronic music while avoiding the pitfalls of become too predictable, or formulaic. I loved Steve Hillage's early work with Gong, his solo work after Gong, and the magnificent Rainbow Dome Musick. Unfortunately, this CD was followed by a foray into more cliche techno waters (Seventh Wave), which were not my taste."
3,solid single,Yall so stupid was definately overlooked.the original version of song is much better than the remix for sure.original song is great;very good single from early 90's crew from atlanta. not impressed by b-side to single though; the plant. song about marajuana that doesn't have anything to say and the beat is sub-par.only for those looking for remix and instrumental
5,One of the best and most obscure metalcore albums,"The vocals are awesome, very original. The music is great, ranging from pummeling to soothing. Every track on here is worth a listen every time and the lyrics are interesting as well. It's too bad they didn't stay with this."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent introduction to Electronic Discovery. It covers all of the important aspects in an easy-to-read format. The emphasis of the title is on ""practical"" and I agree. It is not some academic tome, but a practical guide of what ED is and how best to use it. It also has excellent information on how companies should handle their electronic data, so that alone is worth reading. This is bound to become more and more important as we become more paperless in the corporate world. Definitely recommended."
2,"It's too big to get in and out of my front door, or suv","It's light and sturdy, the snaps snap tightly, easy to put together. However, it is too big for me to get through the front door of my house! One needs a garage to store it in. Once I put it together I realized I have to take it apart to get it outside and I don't have a garage so it's just sitting here in my living room. Also, it will only fit to one bike as it comes with only 1 coupler. It won't attach to multiple bikes like other bike trailers will. Looking back I would have definitely investigated this further."
3,Harness system could be better,Assembly was straight forward and quick. Worked well as a stroller. A sun screen would be nice. Also the set up for the harness is a bit cumbersome.
4,Great product,"The Schwinn Mark II bike trailer works great. Easy to set up, easy to fold away and pack for car trips. Easy to attach and detach from the bike. Good storage. Kid loves it. Only complaint I have is that the fasteners for the sholder straps don't work very easily. Hard even for Dad to get undone. Overall, though, this thing works as advertised - a rarity!"
4,Pretty good trailer,"I am very happy with this trailer. There is only one reason I didn't give it 5 stars. One of the snaps on mine is not in the right spot to snap the top. It works fine without it though. Otherwise, it is light weight and is built well."
3,so so,"i returned mine. i spent hours researching and i thought i'd love this. sadly it was not all i'd hoped for. seat comfort for the kids was important to me and these seemed ""slouchy"""
5,Raw Music from the Streets of Palestine,"It is almost impossible to not enjoy the DAM's CD. The music has that raw street edge all good music groups start with before the money starts filling the coffers. The conditions come through with this music, and there are few mediums better suited to expres the reality of street life than hiphop. As a note I don't speak Arabic and am just now learning the alphabet. Dispite this language barrier I can hear the lyrical and poetic nature of the language given a hiphop beat. The singers are street poets, who can convey their intender message through the loanguage barrier.Great CD, a must buy.Second Note, this is one of the handfulls of Hiphop music I actually like."
5,Great Stuff,Seems to dry much quicker than regular stain. I just need this small can for some touch up.
5,refinisher,I have not opened this product as yet but am prepared to start my project on two old chests. I have usedf this brand before and have always been pleased with the results so I would usually purchase this brand for refinishing things.
2,Extra nibs are great - but grip was not same as original pen,"After about 6 months of heavy use, the grey rubber grip on my pen ripped. Bought this set for nib flexibility and to replace the grip. The included grip does not have an opening for the rocker switch (for mouse functions) on the side of the grip. The included grey grip completely covers the rockcer switch area. Does not make sense since an extra rocker switch is included in the package. At the time I purchased, the product review was not clear that the grip did not allow for rocker switch use (the description has since been corrected). The extra nibs and nib tools are nice - but this set is not a true replacement of all parts of the OEM pen."
2,Misleading photos,"Item does not come with case as depicted in product photos. The replacement rubber grip is not notched for the side switch...and it comes with a replacement side switch?I researched further at the Wacom website, and that completely matches their description: ""...a rubber grip without the holes for the side switch, a spare side switch..."" I wish this description was in the Amazon listing.That the grip isn't notched isn't Amazon's fault, it's Wacom; it makes no sense, and for anyone that's dealt with Wacom for a while will agree, this is pretty par for the course with them."
4,Useful accessory kit,"The Wacom accessory kit is definitely nice to have with you, the different nibs give you varying feels with your tablet and the nib removal tool is certainly helpful in changing the nibs when you need to.The nibs are very small and easy to loose, however, so I feel that there should be better options given by Wacom to store our nibs and pen accessories. Personally, I would like a small case with divided sections (for the different nibs, removal tool, etc) that would snap open and shut so we could store our tablet accessories and nibs in one convenient location."
3,Got exactly what reviews said,"You get everything that is advertised except for the case, which is really disappointing considering it's a ton of tiny nibs that just roll around all over the place.And the grip doesn't have the hole in the side for the rocker button, so I emailed wacom to ask about it.They told me that they do not offer the original grip for sale but they offer 1 complimentary one to each intuos3 owner.So if you're bummed about it not being your original grip, shoot Wacom and email :) and they should clear it up.They told me it might take two week to deliver, I'm at just over a week now and it hasn't arrived, but I trust wacom enough."
3,Don't buy if you're replacing the original pen's rubber sleeve.,"Like another reviewer, I bought this because the rubber grip on my original pen became torn. But what is not immediately apparent in the product description or photo of this accessory kit is that the included rubber grip sleeve does NOT feature an opening for the rocker switch, so this sleeve disables the pen's side button functions.There's doesn't seem to be any offering for a replacement of the original rubber grip. There is an accessory kit for the Intuos4 version of the pen, which DOES include the proper sleeve, but after zooming in on the image, it appears to be slightly different, and it's unknown if it will fit the Intuos3 pen.INTUOS4 Pen Accessory Kit"
3,Undecided,"For me, I didn't really need this product -- the tips that came with the pad were sufficient, and most visually discernable effects seem to be controlled by software rather than physical pen tip shape.I'm giving it 3 stars only because what you get is what the product description says you well get (physically)."
3,Very nice pieces of plastic,"If you use a Wacom tablet, you'll need to buy replacement nibs at some point and you get a nice little assortment of nibs.Unfortunately, those 15 little pieces of plastic are quite pricey.A little organizer or storage container of some sort would have been nice, especially since the product page is pictured with one. All you get are a couple of small plastic baggies of nibs shipped in a box that is far too big.For the price, another rubber grip with the rocker switch opening would have been nice.To summarize, they work just fine but it's a case of an accessory being overpriced because they can."
4,Why so expensive,"Fifteen little plastic toothpicks, why are they so expensive? It makes absolutely no sense. 4/5 for being pointlessly expensive and having no case when pictured with one, even though I knew it didn't come with one. Remove the advertising picture of them in a case then. Nothing much else to say, they do what they do."
4,great band,"I love the berlin project i'm actually 17 but this is alot easier. my band, a boring tuesday @ aboringtuesday.com, played with the berlin project and it was a blast. They put on an amazing show and they are great guys. I'm not a big fan of the scene they're in but i really repect what they do, they're relly good at it. i'd recomend you buy this album if you like all that matchbook romance kind of stuff."
2,An edition of dubious quality,"This review concerns the Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought Revised Student Edition (2007), edited by Ansell-Pearson and translated by Diethe. I have not systematically compared the English with the German but several things make me uneasy.The quotations from Greek and Latin are a chaos of misprints (see, for example, pages 14, 21, 68). Clearly no one familiar with these languages looked over this ""revised"" edition. Nietzsche the philologist would have wept.I also was confused by the German words occasionally included in brackets in the English text, as these often seemed to be neither key philosophical terms nor at all difficult to translate. For instance, why do we need to know that ""such paradoxical and paralogical concepts"" translates ""solcher paradoxer und paralogischer Begriffe"" (p. 94, cf. pp. 90 and 99)?"
3,it's o.k.,"My 3 1/2 year old son can not get the guy in,but his 5 1/2 yr. old sister can,so I think he will grow into it.It is too big for him to zoom around the house-it is awkward for him to hold.And the windsheild falls off almost everytime it is opened."
2,Not a well designed toy.,"We purchased this toy for your 4 year old. He loves Rescue Heroes, but this toy doesn't get much use. It is very difficult to put any figure in the seat. It takes a lot of effort to make the blades spin, and they spin for only a short time for each pull. Finally, it is awkward to hold and ""pretend-fly"" with, as there isn't any convenient handle."
2,"Run Away, Don't Buy!","I should have read the reviews before buying. This toy is incredibly poorly designed. My 3 year old son needs help with every aspect of it. It is hard even for me to fit the Rescue Heroes in, the rescue hoist rope is very difficult to play with, my son likes the toy, buy unless you have lots of time to play with it also, do not buy it. I am just waiting for the chance to get rid of it!"
1,"Rescue Heroes Quick ""frustration"" helicopter","My son has several rescue heroes vehicles and this is his least favorite of all. Like others have said the hero falls out easily once he's placed inside, the windshield pops off constantly, and the propeller blades do NOT stay on at all either. Not only is he frustrated with this toy but then I become frustrated from having to fix it a million times. This is definately not worth the money...you're better off getting the fire truck or police vehicle..they provide much more enjoyment!!"
5,Rescue Heroes Helicopter,"I have two boys, ages 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 and they have really enjoyed all of the Rescue Hero products, especially the helicopter. However, the rope that acts as a towing mechanism on the helicopter has gotten wound up inside the helicopter and cannot be removed as it was a one time assembly item."
2,COPTER,"THIS IS A NICE ADDITION TO THE SET. ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T HAVE NOISES OR LIGHTS. IT IS NOT REAL THRILLING TO A CHILD, UNLESS THEY HAVE A GREAT IMAGINATION. MY CHILD DOESN'T USE IT THAT MUCH."
3,Not Worth The Money,"Out of all of the toys in my son's Rescue Hero's Collection, this is by far his least favorite. The figures do not lock in to the vehicle like most of the others, and since it has no sides the figures fall out constantly. My son gets frustrated, and then drops it in my lap to see if I can make it work. At [the price] it is totally overpriced, when for [almost the same cost]you can get the Voice Tech Jet which is a far superior toy. Save yourself and your child the aggrevation and stay away from this one."
2,other rescue hereo toys are better,"I bought this for xmas last year for my 5 yr. old. The pull string got stuck out (which keeps the blades from spinning) the very first day. Although we fixed it it continues to do it. It is VERY difficult to get a rescue hereo into the seat, can't be done by a child. And the helicopter is not balanced very well so when you put it on the landing pad of the command center it is very easy to knock it off, which is rather dangerous because it is a fairly large item. We like other pieces much better. Maybe the fire helicopter works better."
4,Three Cheers for Fisher Price!,"My kids absolutely LOVE Rescue Heroes! It is so nice to see some action figures out there that aren't meant to fight, but to help others instead. When children come to our house to play, the Quick Response Helicopter is the first thing they pick up!"
2,Rescue Heroes Helicopter,"If I could give this toy no stars for durability I would. It was broken within days. My son loves the Rescue Heroes toys. We have never had a problem with any of the other toys in this series and I would highly recommend them. However, save your money and don't buy this one."
2,Some of the parts missing,"Hello, I purchased the Fisher Price Quick Response Helicopter at Christmas, keeping it until my grandson's 4th birthday. He likes action toys and I thought this would be perfect for him. However, the retracting pack holder and the rescue rope were missing from the package. I notice right away for a small child, the helicopter does not stand alone, except when on the platform. The plastic cover over the seat comes off too easily, also. We both are disappointed in the new product. We haven't been able to use the retracting pack, since it is missing. Thanks! Bette Somers"
1,Pull string doesn't work,"The pull string never worked. My son also has the Rescue Hero Tower, with the helicopter pad on top, which this Rescue Hero Helicopter does not stand on. What is the point?"
2,"mmm, wehere is the fire","The first song is great, Lennon's mother. The introduction of each song takes about 1 minute and this is very boring, it takes the tempo away. I had expected more power and faster tracks."
3,"Works, but takes too long to undo for bit changes...","This product does what it's supposed to do, but changing bits once you have it cranked down is a pain. It takes forever to back it off so you can get to the collet. It either needs a quick-release, or it needs a Phillips screw head mounted in the center of the know so you can use a power drill to tighten it/loosen it quickly. I drilled out the end of mine and epoxied in a good quality No. 2 Phillips machine screw--with my cordless drill it's a lot easier to run it up or down now."
1,broken condoms,"these aren't suited for guys who are big, and that's probably why they broke right away. at least they don't smell as bad as trojans.but these condoms break really really easily."
1,Dont like it.,This condom is small and less lubricate. It is is less sensitive. It is strong. More expensive than any other brand.
4,Great for an Overview.,This book is great for an overview without the details. Very useful for beginners. He outlines the essential principles and this is worth the Kindle price.
3,Not Ellis's best work,"Ellis jokingly says on page 281 that REBT can relieve the sufferings of the damned in hell by teaching them that damnation is not ""awful,"" but merely ""inconvenient."" This kind of remark shows the range of applications of his fundamental psychotherapeutic ideas, which he repeats over and over again in this collection of semi-scholarly papers.While the repitition may be part of Ellis's didactic strategy, it does get tedious to read after awhile. You can get a better idea of Ellis's key teachings in his _Albert Ellis Reader_, published a few years ago and still in print.I find Ellis's new infatuation with postmodernism in this book puzzling, however. If one's reality is subjectively or socially constructed, by what criteria can you decide that some ideas are ""irrational""? And why is emotional upset considered undesirable without some objective standard of comparison?"
2,Sander less than ideal,The dust bag is cheaply made and not as useful as it could be. The little disk which rides under the head assembly needs replacing frequently in heavy use. and it is hard to find.
4,Overall good,"I've had the sander for about a year now and it is pretty good overall. The compact size lets it go into tight workspaces. It is light weight and can easily be operated with one hand. This weekend I spent about 7 hours sanding and even after several hours of continuous use it worked well. I have a couple of small complaints. First the dust bag does tend to pop off frequently, which can be a messy nuisance. In addition, the dust collection is poor. Most of thet sawdust ends up in the air. Next you can really feel the vibration in your hands. After about 2 hours my hands feel like they are falling asleep. Also the unit gets very hot after prolonged use. It won't get hot enough to burn you, but it does make it more uncomfortable to hold. On the plus side, it has a good quality compact case that holds plenty of sandpaper."
2,"Durable, but too much downtime","This Dewalt is a durably built sander, but the plastic ring used for the controlled finishing feature wears out much too quickly. I only get about 4-6 hours of use before this part need replacing. No home improvement, hardware, or building supply sells this part in my area, which means it has to be ordered everytime the part wears out, meaning too much downtime. Not only does this part have to be replaces every 4-6 hours of use, the part itself costs $7 to $8 apiece. This is extremely poor design and needs to be corrected. The hook and loop also stopped accepting sand paper after about 10 hours of use, however, I'm using the cheaper priced adhesive backed paper on the worn pad and it works fine. As much as I use the sander, I would be much better off buying another brand sander with the money it takes to replace the controlled finishing ring and the pad. I'm going with a porter cable or BOSCH."
2,fly off paper sander,"I have had to replace the hook and loop base on this sander three times. I can only manage to go through about 50 sand paper discs before, yes another hook and loop base for another 20 bucks. If I had known I would have gotton a psa sander instead. otherwise the sander works good."
5,"GREAT SANDER, GREAT VALUE!","The DW 421 is a great sander.This is the ideal sander for everyone from the novice to the professional. The sander is quite versatile and can be used for fine finish work or heavy stock removal. I use it for cabinet doors, trim work and general wood work. My first use was for sanding cabinet doors. To my surprise there were no swirl marks when I finished them with a satin polyurethane which shows imperfections.The DeWalt's Engineers went all out with the lightweight, well balanced, comfortable and ergonomic design. It fits in the palm of your hand with the power switch at your finger tips. It has minimal vibration. The hook and loop makes changing sand paper a breeze.All these features for under $80."
4,Pretty darn good,"I actually got this free when I bought a DeWalt Miter saw, but I was very impressed with its performance. I have used it non-stop for the past year and it has held up to all my needs. My only complaint is that I burn through sandpaper pretty quickly (ha ha)."
4,replacement parts,"I have enjoyed this sander very much. I bought it for crafts and hobbies. I have only used it 3 or 4 times, and it worked great. My only complaint if the dust cannister, part no. 151659-00 It has a crack in it, and I can't seem to find out how to order a replacement. Since I have alergies I cannot use the sander until get another dust canister."
2,Thought I was buying the best but...,"I thought this would be the last sander I would ever have to buy, but I guess I was wrong. I have used this sander for a year and a half and probably have less than 50 hours on it. It is taking several seconds to get up to speed and it has no power left-almost dies under its own weight. I thought I was buying the best, now I don't know what to buy."
2,problem switch,"A handy machine but the switch doesn't work right. It has a rubber cover and it is difficult to toggle, my wife sometimes says it is broke then with a little work I get it going. The cost to repair is too much in comparison to buying new."
2,Poor durability,"My disappointment with this sander is that the sanding disk (the hook portion of the sander) failed to hold the paper after several hours of use. Upon talking to DeWalt, I was told that this part only had of life of 5-10 hours of use and then would need to be replaced. The replacement cost is about $15 at that rate you could by a new sander more cheaply that continuing to replace the disks. Nothing in the product literature warns the user of this flaw. Surely there are better products out there."
5,Great Helper,This is a great book to help pull out you inner writer. Fun and fast exersise gets right to the point.
5,How to get started --- and keep going,"Whether you are a published writer, or are still struggling to make it into print, Gail Carson Levine's book is a must read. Even though it is primarily written for young people, I find the exercises and advice on the writing process extremely useful. In addition,it is just a delightful book to read. Would that I had her skill with the written wordThings I Learned from My Grandmother About Leadership and Life: (How to Light a Fire Under People Without Burning Them Out)would have been a better book.""Writing Magic"" should be on every writer's bookshelf."
4,Good Advice,This book is excellent for young people who are just beginning to write. It gives the writer ideas and formulas to create characters and scenes to make their writing original and interesting.
4,"Written for kids but useful for adults, too","A friend recommended this to me with the understanding that it was written for young people, and my first impression was that it would be great for my kids but I would have little use for it. Instead I've decided that I really like the way the various components of writing are discussed in short and easy to read chapters that really get the point across. Plus it's inspiring, making the concepts very easy to apply.The book covers the basics of writing fiction and does so in a very illustrative manner. It talks about the proper way to use dialog, adding details that help to set a tone or make a point, and others. There are a lot of instructive writing ""assignments"" that I didn't do, but which my kids found kind of fun. Overall, a nice and succinct book on the fundamentals of writing fiction."
5,A useful writing guide for the young,"This is a young people's guide to writing. It provides advice on how to start a story, how to get ideas for stories, how to develop and conclude stories. It is written with enthusiasm , and tries to give practical advice including advice about selling one's work. It also speaks about 'writing' as a way of organizing one's life, and as having purposes outside the selling of one's work.It seems to me a fine down- to - earth work though perhaps a bit optimistic and therefore misleading about the real chances for most people's making a career in writing."
2,"Advice was child like, and it didn't help a lot","Now when I was reading the Writing Magic book I just knew that the advice was not very good and the book was not entertaining. The only fun part was when you made the character portfolio, and that was it. The advice was not useful and it was geared more towards kids ages 10 and under than real authors. If you want to get a book about writing fantasy get a book from an author that doesn't focus mainly on unuseful advice. Plus she is constantly advertising her books."
4,"Not exactly what I expected, but pleased with it.","I thought that this book was written for adult writers. But it's clearly appropriate for younger writers as well. I think it provides good suggestions for adults and younger folks alike. Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase."
4,I loved it,I am 8 years old and I read Writing Magic to help me write better. I learned a lot from the book. I think people who want to write really well should read this very good book.
3,Clever book for aspiring young writers.,"My mom got me this book as a present because I'm interested in become a writer, and I loved Gail Carson Levine's books when I was younger. It was a cute book, but definitely geared towards young children, maybe around the ages of 10-13. ( I'm 17...)"
5,AWESOME BOOK,"This book helped tons of my students with their descriptions in their creative writing endevors. I couldn't ask for a better way to get them involved in their writing, other than reading! AMAZING! A must-read!"
4,"Good, live tracks!","This was Jimi in a BBC studio, playing rough and raw. Killing Floor is particularly nice, with a sharp, cruel sound to it. Hear My Train is more upbeat than in other versions.There's a lot of people in there with him and it sounds like quite a party. Can be annoying if you're hoping for clean music tracks but it does provide a small glimpse of swinging London. Kinda' fun sounding."
5,this is jimi goofing around in a british radio station.,"jimi hendrix is known as the ""electric negro dandy"" (i didn't want to use the other ""n"" word.)when it comes to guitar playing. this cd features him 2-3 years before his death in 1970 goofing around at the BBC. he did a beatles song and an elvis song and some of his own songs as well. jimi is sorely missed by the music world and he will continue to influence alot of other guitar players."
1,...because one star is as low as the ratings go!,"Assembly directions weren't easy to follow. After assembled and filled with oil and fuel, engine started easily. However, after running in the garden for 3 minutes, the engine died and would not restart. One bolt fell out of the carburetor and a second one was loose. By the time I had changed oil the first time, I hated this machine. It is impractical to back up without pulling the wheel pins and placing in free-wheel mode. The wheel pins keep falling out. You can't back it up without straining a muscle in your back. And after a couple of hours, the tubular frame was twisted, due to the constant pressure on the handle trying to keep it going straight. It has a directional bias. It also does not steer well on a slight hill. Troy-Bilt should be ashamed releasing such a product!"
3,lose bolts,I got my tiller later than amazon said. When I got the tillerit had a broke gas tank it must of got broke in shipping and most of the bolts was lose and one was missing that went to the carb. I tried to get help but only got the run around no help after 5 pm and the help you get was no good. The tiller did run and works good after I spent 3 hours putting it together and finding A bolt to replace the one that was missing. Then the next day I had to buy a repair kit for the gas tank I hope it will hold. good luck if you buy one
3,A Carnival Christmas 97,Thiz iz a good cd BUT if you can get a hold of a 4 track Carnival Christmas i would suggest you buy that one and send me one too cause the 4 track iz fresh az hll later brad
2,WHAT HAPPENED TO 4 SONGS?,"The new release of CARNIVAL CHRISMAS does include ""Santa's a Fat Bxtch"" and ""Red Chrismas"", but they left out ""Santa Killers"" and ""He's Coming"". ICP gets props though!"
3,"What happened to the ""Santa Killaz""?","Well, this release was pretty Fresh and all, but they failed to include 1 song that was on the '94 release. ""Santa Killaz"" was the best song on it. The song included an apperance by their producer Mike E. Clark and Fink the east side G. Its still a good buy though, listen and learn the ways of the dark carnival! Tang!"
4,One of the best live bands in the US...,"As the director of Pierced Music, a promotion agency in Roseburg Oregon, I have to say I have been repeatedly impressed with Emery. They have performed for us, and others in the area many times. The energy they invoke is infectious and the amazing music that backs it up is nothing short of electric. It is only too bad the song Walls, is not on this disc or it would be perfect. They have since the release of this demo, been signed and on the road, much more than ever. Hope to have them back to play one of our shows, very very soon..... If you enjoy Melodious hardcore, this is the CD for you."
1,Nope,Well seeing as the review and band information all refers to Emery the hardcore/emo band and this CD is by emery pike Id say Im not pleased. I feel missled and gyped.
3,"We, here in NY, also know blues","Don't be fooled by other reviewers who use their Chicago residence as a if their review were a more credible one simply because the kid plays the Blues. In my view, this is a very good CD, and Johnny is a great Blues guitarist. It is a great accomplishment for someone his age."
1,Keep Child Prodigies at home.,"""A great accomplishment at his age"" doesnt mean rat. This is a very shoddy record, it doesnt matter if the guy is 11 or 71. Why are we so beset with these ""child prodigies"" when there are so many other, better, guitar players? ""Marketability"" doth not good music make. My four year old plays piano real good, want to hear it on the radio?"
1,Uncontrollable Diarrhea,"I liken this record to a batch of uncontrollable diarrhea. First, your stomach cramps, and then you flee the room at top speed."
4,This CD is great. Sounds like 50's blues too me.,"I've seen Jonny Lang 4 times with my kids and really enjoy his ""Lie To Me"" album and ""Wander this World"". I've always been hesitant to buy the ""Kid Jonny Lang"" CD because of his age ... didn't think his voice would be decent, but this CD immediately became my favorite. The beat is really great, every song is good. Sure the kid didn't write the stuff but does a fantastic job of singing and playing the tunes. My 72 year old Mother loves it, 6 year old daughter can't keep still in the car. IT'S AWESOME, TRUST ME :)"
5,the man boy can sing,the man sings like a weathered black man well known on the alleys of the down and out.
5,An energetic blues album. Highly reccomended.,"I've bought this CD, and I think its Jonny's best. It combines energetic music with soulful titles such as Nice & Warm. I reccomend it to anyone who's interested in contemporary blues. Jonny Lang is a talented individual, and his music is both fun, entertaining and touching."
5,Saying my peace,"For those reviewers from Chicago who claim sole ownership of the Blues and exclusive rights to an opinion on the subject, keep in mind that Muddy Waters brought the Blues to Chicago from MISSISSIPPI. For those who slam Jonny Lang for being young, would you prefer that the Blues die out with it's aging icons? What difference does it make where someone is from or how old they are? If they've got the chops for it, let them do what they do best. As for this particular cd, I've heard worse debut albums. It's every bit as good as his other two offerings. I highly recommend it!"
1,don't bother buying,you can get it here:paulgraham [dot] com [slash] onlisptext.htmlpaul graham owns the copyright and links to it on his website. I can't understand the price of over $100 for this item.
5,Plantronics Voyager 510SL,"A bity pricey, but this is an excellent product. Oonce I got a set of equipment that worked it was very easy to use - the first shipment had a defective headset, i.e. one that wouldn't synch with the base station. This was an anomaly I'm sure, as I've owned 2 Plantronics Voyager 510 headsets in the past w/out problems. I've been using the very heavily at work for a month or so and I'm sold - will buy one for the home office too.- Easy to install the handset lifter- easy to synch the headset to the base station- easy to synch the headset to my Blackberry"
4,Good Buy,The product is great to have for hands-free purposes. The only problem I've experienced is the lift cradle doesn't fit well on my phone. I've had to secure my handset to the cradle with rubberbands to prevent the handset from falling off while disconnecting calls.
5,Best Bluetooth Headset I've Ever Owned,"I use this headset with a digital Siemens phone system and a BlackBerry 8800. I am very impressed with how the headset can seamlessly switch between a call on the cell phone to the desk phone and back again without any issues. I've been wanting something like this for a long time, but just assumed it didn't exist. Set up was very easy, the hardest thing was waiting the recommended three hours to get a full charge before using it. The headset it self is the most comfortable one I've ever worn and I have gone through a few of them. For the fist time I don't have to have the volume cranked up all the way or have to jam the earbud in my ear canal to hear the person on the other end. I've had no complaints from the people on the other end of the call about the sound quality, very impressive in my office which is a very loud environment.Great headset!"
5,Outstanding!,"For the serious student of Kabbalah, this book reveals the bigger picture. The four levels of reality are addressed, each in turn. Really helpful!"
3,"Tree of Life teachings for body, mind, and soul.","This book's purpose is to relate the sefirot of the Tree of Life system to the whole of human existence. How well it did so could be debated. I thought that the author did quite nicely with applying the tree systemology to the psyche and soul, but found the interpretations as they apply to physical existence to be forced.The only part of this book I flat out disagreed with however, was the explanation and resulting implication that divorce is somehow acceptable and necessary to certain people's evolution.Overall, the psychology used is agreeable in modern schools, but has certainly been influenced by some modern tolerance that is in opposition to the Bible."
5,Wonderful movie!!!,"The Cat Returns was made by a studio in Japan which I and many many other people love, Studio Ghibli. The Cat Returns is a magical movie and will take anybody (no matter the age!) through a magical adventure! I don't like to spoil the movie for people, so I rather say: Read the other reviews for a review on the movie, but read my review if you want to know if its going to be a good movie. And it is! I purchased it knowing it would be a good one because I enjoyed watching Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, and Kiki's Delivery Service. Also available from Studio Ghibli on Amazon! This movie is truly a touching tale... so purchase it today... you will not be regretful, at least, I wasn't."
4,Another brilliant Studio Ghibli creation!,"This film obviously cannot compete with Ghibli's Spirited Away. It does offer an interesting plot and has some very funny moments. The basic story is about a young school girl who saves this cat (she doesn't know it's a cat prince) from being run over by a truck in the street. She is thanked by cat kingdom with an assortment of gifts that only a cat could appreciate (mice, cat nip, etc). She travels into cat kingdom because the cat king wishes her to marry his son. Like all Studio Ghibli films, the first 15 minutes of the film are normal and then the film takes you on a wild journey into a different world. Children and adults can enjoy this film. The DVD extras are not very impressive but the quality is good."
4,Hayao Miyazaki's fans,"I have yet to watch the English version of this film so my review is based on the original Japanese release. It's a light and fun story of a high school girl who saves the life of a cat who ends up being the prince of Cat Kingdom. The kingdom therefore wants to shower Haru with gifts, one of the gifts is becoming the princess of the Kingdom. This is one our family's favorite Hayao Miyazaki films (behind Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service). Our three year is always asking to watch it.We did watch a few minutes of the English version just so our daughter could understand more (she's just learning Japanese) and the voices were better than most of the Disney dubbed films. However, one voice ruined it for us (the king's servant) and we switched back to Japanese. I'd recommend the Cats Return to parents of young kids or anyone that enjoys Hayao Miyazaki's films or Japanimation in general."
4,Cute and Spontaneous,"This movie took me totally off guard. I sat down to watch this movie with a bunch of little kids thinking it would be the same old talking animal movie. But I found myself almost rolling on the floor laughing along with the kids. The humor was witty and spontaneous, and the characters had excellent chemistry with each other."
5,Great Movie!!,"Although the movie was short (only an hour and fifteen minutes) it was really really good. I loved the pacing of the story. It didn't feel rushed, and the main character (Haru) made the whole story funny and believable to some degree. If you're into anime, this one is a fun movie to watch with family and friends."
4,Love cats,"Being a cat lover, I found this film to be wonderful and entertaining. A little weird but enjoyed it none the less."
3,"Movie's great, shipping not so much","I love the movie, it's funny and sweet, when it arrived however the case was cracked and now the edge of one of the corners has fallen off, it was shipped in one of those small paper envelopes with the bubble wrap glued inside of it. Also i'd bought it from one of Amazon's vendor's not Amazon itself, i've never had issues when i get something from Amazon directly, however i have run into some shipping problems with other vendor's before."
2,Too basic for me.,Simple basic children's film which is lovely and sweet for kids but anyone older than ten I can't imagine getting too much from this.I'd go for Spirited Away and if you like that Howl's Moving Castle.
1,"Ok, but glad I decided to rent it instead....","It was ok, but I've seen better from Studio Ghibli. I had this item in my cart for awhile and I came across it at Blockbuster one night and decided to give it a shot. Again, glad I rented it first because it was NOT something I would purchase. I think I would've been really mad if I had bought this online and watched it. Usually when I watch Studio Ghibli films I walk away remembering something breathtaking or a wonderful feeling I got while watching it. Not so with this one. I don't remember anything about this film except for some cats walkin' around on their hind legs talking and crap. Again, don't waste your money, rent it. It cost me 2 bucks to rent at Blockbuster."
2,Decent movie; Bad DVD,"This movie isn't really up to par with Ghibli's other work, but it's still pretty good. It's really simple and transparent and aimed at kids, but it's not without charm. Plus, the animation is really something to look at.However, this item gets 2 stars, because the DVD is messed up. On all of the other Ghibli/Disney releases, the viewer is given two subtitle choices: one is a closed caption version of the English dub, and the other is a more literal subtitle translation of the original Japanese. Although this DVD gives the viewer both choices, both subtitle tracks are the same. They are both closed captioning for the English dub. This means that if you watch the film in Japanese with subtitles, you get a very inaccurate translation (sometimes you see subtitles without even hearing a line spoken.) It is incredibly annoying, and if I could, I'd return my copy. You've been warned."
4,Cute and Fun,"This film manages to be action filled and sweet at the same time. Another great Studio Ghibli film with several characters reprising their roles from Ghibli's ""Whisper of the Heart."""
1,Classic wrong citation style,"The very first page of this book is an example of what is wrong with the APA style of citation. That style is for short pieces in technical journals. It is not for use in a work such as this. Instead of footnotes, the style interrupts the flow of the text by inserting author's names and pages within parentheses, breaking up the sentences.This might be a matter of choice for an author writing on a general topic. But in regards to academic dishonesty, the authors should also know that the type of discourse both dictates the type of citation to be used, and that certain citation systems are more given to academic dishonesty than others (when used outside of academic journals)."
5,great book,"I don't normally read science fiction. But this book just caught my eye. I guess because of the current news on cloning. The moment I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down!I stayed up all night to finish it (Good thing I had the next day off!) I really love the story line and the pace of the book. I hope the author writes more I will be waiting for the next book. Pick up a copy you will love it. He must be planning on a second book because the ending seems to suggest it!"
1,Grammatically Incorrect,"So maybe I did not read the entire book, but the first 10 pages and the last two told me all I needed to know. It was actually painful to try and decipher Kinkhorsts many grammatical errors and plain idiocy. A message for Mr. Kinkhorst, you tend to need more than a sentence to make up a paragraph buddy. A must buy for a good laugh.I have a signed copy of the book, on sale for 10 cents."
3,OK for the price,"The toy is durable, though the battery case cover comes off very easily. I had to tape the cover on.The other issue is that it is too loud and there is no way to reduce the volume.Otherwise, it serves the purpose well. My kid likes it."
5,A great First Step,"I have used this with now seven children for home schooling. No, it's not Shakespeare's Shakespeare, it's Charles and Mary Lamb's rendition.It is a great way to introduce the Shakespeare to a younger child as a way to get a grasp of the story. Then we read the real Shakespeare version and you are able to enjoy the story and the way Shakespeare writes without trying to figure out the characters, plot etc.And I might add, it is a good way to become familiar with the tales if you are an adult too.So, my advice is to read this first and then most definitely read the real author himself."
3,Shakespear 101 for kids!,"If you want your younger kids to read Shakespeare, then this is the kind of book you want to get. Some of the nuances of the writer are lost in this translation, but you get the basic idea of what the story is about."
1,tales from shakespeare,no table of contents.horrendous to navigate.frankly shameful that they would sell it this way.
2,A nice read for children,"As a younger person in the nineties, I dipped into the plays of Shakespeare, and this book let me get into the classic stuff. It was interesting, put into kids' stories so as not to intimidate the younger enthusiast, and altogether, it was a good book. I suppose you have to be in to Shakespeare to enjoy it wholly though....A gentle, relaxing dip into Shakespeare. I'll give two stars."
5,An excellent book that will enthrall everyone who reads it.,I read this book as a child of eight (back in 1970). It was a gift from my scientist father (an avid Shakespeare fan) as an introduction to Shakespeare.The book served its purpose very well and I have now given it to my sons aged 7 and 9 who have found it extremely enjoyable. The best part of this book is the way it weaves a rich tapestry in layman's language without the confusing and often ambiguous old English of the original transcripts.Lamb's Tales makes an excellent primer for those going to see the plays in traditional old English. The book allows all the complex plot elements and characters to be understood and spotted in the live play. The prose format allows the reader to conjure up the images and situations more readily than if struggling with the poetry.I heartily recommend this book to all ages.
4,Really good...helps me remember all the plays!,"It's a great book that allows you to remember the main elements of Shakespeare's plays. It's great for exams and essays because you can understand the plot, theme, tone and characters through these very nicely written stories. It's a must to anyone who has to revise for those exams or just to get a feel for Shakespeare's work. It maybe a little bit hard for kids aged 12 or less."
1,Completely void of information,"The only good thing about this book is the title ""The book casino managers fear most"". It was enough to get me to buy the book but after a very painful read you will find that you agree with the casino managers and will describe this book as ""The book you fear most"" No information is provided in this book that will help you to improve your chances in Vegas. Anyone who has ever been to a gaming establishment one time will already know what this author took 30 years to learn. Don't waste your valuable time or money on this book."
3,It grows on you,Not enough substance to carry the movie through to the end but there are definitely plenty of funny moments. The acting is pretty good and I found the characters believable and likeable. Excellent casting. Nicely done DVD including good director's commentary. I think this movie deserves more notice.
1,Chump a Cheap Knock Off,"If you've seen Christopher Guest's 1989 film, The Big Picture, then you've seen Chump Change (a much much better version, of course). This D-List chump borrows much of it's plot from The Big Picture - small town guy in big bad Hollywood, with two-faced agents and managers, crazy producers, a film deal that dies when the studio head gets fired and both have very similar happy endings. The boring, short and indulgent DVD bonus scenes should have stayed on the cutting room floor. Merv Griffin: thanks (not) for ""Chump."""
1,this movie sucks,"This movie was NOT funny at all...save your money...I lived in Milwaukee....I went to the same High school as ""Milwaukee Steve""..and I couldnt even muster a chuckle...its BAD....real real BAD!!!!!!"
1,ordered the wrong size,"I was not able to use this screen because it was the wrong size, because of the low cost I did not return it"
2,Wow! What A Banger! Youd Better Not Go Out Without This One!,This is the Best Rap CD I have ever heard!! Wow! His voice is so deep and sexy! And he flows better than Eminem! Definatley 2 star Material to the Fullest!
5,Slept on for way too long.,"When people think of classic albums why doesn't this come up? I catch myself not bringing this up when I'm asked. Shame on everyone including myself for not doing so. This is such a great record capturing all that was good about the golden age...Top-notch lyricism and Memorable production. The next time you buy a hip hop album purchase this, so when your talking about Showbiz & AG, Souls of Mischief, etc. you have another great LP to build w/each other on. Peace!"
5,An Amazing Love Story,"This is one of the few love stories that I find myself reading over and over again. The two main characters are absolutely loveable and unlike many other romances the leading man has an excellent sense of humor that kept me giggling to the end. The leading lady is a strong willed woman who fights for what she believes in, as well as for her man."
2,Bad quality control perhaps?,"After looking at 5 different saws for a couple of hours, I settled on this one. It's use of standard and t-blades was the deciding factor. When I started sawing wood,I noticed that it cut to the right, so I had to face the saw about 25 degrees left to track straight.When I examined it, it looked like the the blade holder, or the entire shaft was crooked. The blade ran against the side of the guide bearing instead of being straight. The power-on locking mechanism did not work all the time, and it seemed chintzy. Also, the blade locking mechanism did not inspire confidence. Besides for these things, it was okay. I thought it felt good in my hand, and the power was good.I returned it and bought a Milwaukee 6266-21. I think I will stay away from Dewalt after this. Seems their QC is sleeping."
3,"Good design, plenty power, but could be better for the price","Have been using for couple of weeks now. So far I like it, here is my findings:the good: handling, power, variable speed switch and blower.the bad: cost, blade release mechanism.the ugly: when make orbital cut on thick material >1"", it tends to cut to the left on the bottom."
1,Can't recommend this saw,"I must own about 20 DeWALT tools and this is a frustrating tool. For the most part I really like DeWALT tools but this one needs to be redesigned. The blade will not track straight. The problem seems to be in the blade mounting system. I have never had a problem with the blade coming loose, however as you screw the cap to tighten the blade you can see the plunger start to turn as you crank down on this thing. Since you tighten to the right, the blade will end up pointed to the right. Now I have found that if you back off slightly you can line it up, but that's not the way a jig saw should work. I think that in this case you would be better served with a Bosch."
2,Should have believed the bad reviews...,"After reading the review that said ""read the manual"", I figured I could pick up a good saw (that was badly adjusted) for short money. Oops. This thing is a piece of junk. It doesn't matter how aggressive (or not) the orbital action is when the shaft has play - I can not get this thing to track a line properly, or to make true cuts. Since pretty much all of the professional quality tools use T-shank blades, it's getting harder and harder to find high-quality ""u"" blades, so the fact that they don't fall out of the saw is pointless - the saw was designed and advertised as working with both, it should work for both.Of course, try looking for a used Bosch - there aren't any, at least not any with a good discount over new. Guess that should tell you something right there. Save your money and buy a Bosch first time out instead of trying this piece of junk first."
1,What a Dud!,"Despite the hefty price tag and prestigious name, this saw won't hold a blade! My first one wouldn't... and neither would the replacement Home Depot gave me. Nothing I did would make a blade stay in. Call to the factory elicited this comment: ""Yeah, we get a lot of complaints about that."" Duh! Tried it one last time and -- the motor went out! I finallly bought the top-of-the-line Craftsman (made by Bosch) and no such problems -- it's a honey."
1,Would I recommend this saw to a friend? Not likely!,"I looked at several Jig Saw Brands and made the mistake of buying this Dewalt.The problem is the blade holding design.The blades shoot out during use.I called Dewalt and was instructed to follow the instructions for installing the blade.Duh...The fact is that the design is bad and Dewalt is sidestepping their responsibility.I own several other Dewalt power tools and they are all fine.This is the first time I've ever even contacted their customer service and I feel very let down by the response I received.I finally just gave up, threw the saw away, and bought a Bosch.Now that I know how Dewalt stands behind their products I don't think I'll ever buy another Dewalt product.Would I recommend this saw to a friend?Not likely."
1,will shop here first from now on to read the reports,The saw that this DEWALT replaced was a Skill. At first I thought I had a real tool after using the waste of resourses Skill called a saw. It was the lack of vibration that fooled me. Every bad thing everyone else said about the Dewalt is true. I really hate the way metal blades pop out. I have tried different brands and styles but none of them will stay in the holder. I wish I had used it a little more befor the return policy ran out.
1,Worst Dewalt product ever!,"By far, this is the worst power tool Dewalt makes. It can't cut straight. It has the worst swayout in the industry. My advice: Buy the Bosch. I tried to get a refund from Amazon, but I had waited too long. Dewalt didn't care that I was bad mouthing their product. (So are the trade magazine reviews) Dewalt needs to stop selling this product. I can't even sell it to my coworkers for $20. Anyone want to buy mine?"
3,Good power but no more...,In general I thing is over price. It has some good things Plenty of power variable speed. But also the blades fall out very easy and the most annoying thing is that I can't get a straight edge no matter what I do. If any body has a suggestion please E-mail me
1,Piece of junk,"Let me say that I am a Dewalt product lover. I use only Dewalt tools. However, this jigsaw is the worst Dewalt product and probably the worst jigsaw on the market. There isn't enough space to list all of my complaints about this saw. Just take my advice and look elsewhere"
1,"Read reviews before purchasing, I wished I had.","Having several DeWalt tools and being very happy with them,I specifically ask for the DeWalt DW321KK as a gift. BAD MISTAKE! This saw will not cut straight. Forcing it to stay in line causes the blade to bend or jump off the guide. Another problem is the sole plate locking mechanism is of poor design and should be re-engineered to work!"
1,Blade change problems,"I don't know how the Dewalt DW321K is for power or dust blowing because I have not been able to keep a blade in it long enough to make a complete cut. I bought this to replace a 20 year old Craftsman which required a screwdriver to change blades. Somewhat inconvient, but it works. It took me 20 minutes to install the blade in the Dewalt. When I turned it on, the blade shot across the room. I have owned a number of good Dewalt tools in the past, which is why I bought this one. I hope the 30 day warrenty isn't up so I can return this saw for another brand."
1,Buy A Bosch!!,"Just recently I had a chance to put the Bosch and the Dewalt through the ringer. I had 42 rafters on a house with swoops that had to be cut in them, no easy task for any saw. The Dewalt didn't last through four cuts seven feet long before it gave out. Not too worry though the Bosch picked up the slack. The problem was, there is a tiny pin that holds the blade holder on the Dewalt straight, sort of a locking pin. This system needs some serious help. Once it pops out or shreds you can not track straight with the saw. So go ahead and save yourself some money and buy the Bosch. Trust me you'll be fixing the Dewalt very soon."
1,What a disappointment!,"I own several DeWalt tools and love them (circular saw, cordless drills), and so I figured this jigsaw would be similarly great. WRONG! The first unit was so bad (tracking and square) that I returned it thinking I must have purchased a lemon (after all - yellow...?). The second unit was identically bad. Blower didn't work, tracking was horrible, cuts were VERY out of square. My 20 year old B&D, ""purchased"" with green stamps, was far better. The only good thing about this saw is that it has lots of power."
2,What happened,I have many Dewalt tools and would rate them all a 5. So based on my experience when I needed a jig saw I bought this one. I was very disapointed in the quality of the cuts. It was also frustrating having to blow off the saw dust to see where my guide line was. After all it has a blower to do this....
1,What more could.... GO WRONG?,"This is my father's saw and it slows me down- PERIOD. I have tried everything i could to secure the quick release bevel which keeps vibrating loose short of throwing this unit in the trash. It also ejects blades as regular practice. I'll be cutting 3/4 inch birch and leave the blade behind and the saw keeps going. That isnt even all of it, the saw tracks like an old pickup truck with a bent frame and bends blades like its job. I cant say enough bad about this one: DONT BUY IT unless you have money to throw away. I have a dewalt circular saw and a dewalt router which are great. This saw is a dud; word on the street is buy a new makita, a bosch or a freud J85."
1,Really Bad Saw,"The ""tool-free blade changer"" feature makes this saw almost useless. After years of walking into a hardware store and grabbing the DeWalt model of whatever I'm looking for, I'm now thinking twice. I can't imagine anyone at the company used this thing for any length of time and still thought it should be sold to consumers. Ugh."
1,To call it a PIECE of JUNK would be too kind.,"This saw will not cut in a straight with a fence or free-hand. In fact, you cannot follow any line. Forcing it to stay in line causes the blade to bend and you wind up with a tapered cut. The sole plate locking mechanism is nearly worthless also. I've tried to discuss this tool with both DeWalt and their Rep and all I get is that they ""will get back to me."" If you need a jig saw, buy anything BUT this one."
1,Belongs in the Scrap Heap,"I bought this saw in spite of the reviews here. I spent hours at the local home improvement store and based on the extra 0.8 amps of power for the same price (over Bosch), I took one home. After two days of attempted use during a hardwood floor installation it went back to the store and the Bosch came home. The sole plate adjustment came loose during almost every cut. I finally locked it in place with a tie-wrap which worked for a few cuts. The bamboo floor material I was working with was not cheap and the saw managed to goon up more than one piece.Don't waste your money."
1,This thing should be averaged at 1 and half stars,All the one star reviews are trued by using it just once. The half star is for the long cord and comfortable handle which is a given for a tool from DeWalt. But obviously not the functions of this tool.
3,Not what I expected =0(,"I had this cookbook before and I loved it, Terry Thompson's recipes are good and the instructions are easy to follow. But I lent it out to someone and never got it back so I was excited to be able to order it online.To my dismay, what I received is a paperback--you know, like, a pocket-sized book that would fit in a small purse. It's the title that I wanted, but I thought I was getting a cookbook that was roughly 8 1/2"" by 11"" like I had before, but what I got is a paperback that's 4 1/4"" by 6 7/8"".It's going to be a little tough to cook from this book, and it won't be long before the pages will be falling out.It just never occurred to me when I ordered that it would be a cheap pocket-sized paperback!The item was mailed in a timely fashion and it's in good condition, BUT IT'S A POCKET-SIZED PAPERBACK!"
5,Authentic Cajun/Creole Cooking,"I was born and raised in southwest Louisiana, and grew up with all of the wonderful Cajun and Creole dishes in this book. This book contains excellent recipes, excellent photographs, and wonderful background text. Also, a list of suppliers is included.This is the cookbook I have recommended to all of my friends who ask about Louisiana cooking. It's a shame that it's out of print."
2,For Bob Hoskins completists only,"This reviewer has never seen a Bob Hoskins performance where he wasn't a credit to his profession. (His masterful performance in ""Mona Lisa"" comes to mind!) In that sense, this film is no exception. But even though the mature members of the supporting cast are fine, it is Hoskins' performance that is this film's only saving grace. Having said that, and acknowledging that the basic plot was, at best, of mild interest, this reviewer was completely put-off by the sickeningly-sweet sub-plot embellishments. One such, the boy-interacts-with-girl subplot and its related ""acting"" was especially obnoxious.This film is suitable only for Bob Hoskins completists or fans of feel-good, heartwarming, fake-thrill juvenility ala the ""family-fare"" Disney flicks (excluding the mandatory juvenile boy-girl sex scene near the end, of course)."
4,"Very good, but watch out for the ending","This book makes for an extremely satisfying conclusion to the Evergence sci-fi trilogy. Throughout the series, Williams and Dix constantly move into 'darker waters' as it were, and this third book is the most suspensful of them all. Incredible secrets about Cane and the other clone warriors are revealed, but the most stunning secrets are about Morgan herself...I give this book five stars and take one off for the most insanely CHEAP ending in history."
1,I'm sorry I read the last book.,"I truly enjoyed the first two books and was looking forward to the conclusion, only to be severely disappointed. The ending was a total wimp-out. I'm so tired of the tendency to invoke ""god"" or some other omnipotent being to wind up so many series. If the first two books hadn't been so good, I'd not have been so disappointed with the last one. The other series that comes to mind is Dan Simmons' Hyperion. It was a total let down in the end too. They could and should have done better."
3,A compelling trilogy comes to a disappointning end,"The saga of renegade intelligence agent Morgan Roche concludes the Evergence trilogy in a most surprising way. Sean Williams and Shane Dix have proven themselves to be authors of note in creating charcters and a 'universe' of surprising complexity and interest. The mystery of Adoni Cane and the genetically enhanced clone warriors builds in tension through all 3 books, nearly a thousand pages, to come to a most disappointing conlusion. I refrained from writing a review for more than a month to try and approach this less emotionally. After all, I had invested considerable time and emotion in characters and plotlines that came to a much to abrupt conclusion. It felt as if the authors just ran out of creative energy and care for their creation, and decided to end it. I still recommend the trilogy, as it is filled with fine writing, excellent ideas and fascinating characterizations."
2,"Great series, terrible ending","I was very excited about reading this series, i'll admit that the reasons for this are that the writers are Australian(like me) and i heard they will be writing sequels to the original Star Wars movies. But i digress. I loved the first two books and the third was just as exciting and at times thought provoking. The let down was the terrible ending. Sure, I can see the big point being made and it caused me think about that point for and hour or so, but the whole direction of the series took a dramatic turn at the end. There was a totally different feel to the last 5 or 10 pages of A Dark Imbalance, it felt like the ending to another novel, like it had been tacked on. What a shame."
5,An epic climax to an epic trilogy,"Williams and Dix complete their trilogy in fine style with a plot line that twists and turns 'till the last. The questions posed by the first two Evergence novels (including the title) are answered in shocking style with implications for the whole of the future Galaxy and the story is put into context with our own time line. Morgan Roache does battle with enemies without and within in an attempt to bring a measure of stability from a potentially explosive situation.Compelling reading for all fans of well conceived sci-fi, five out of five."
3,Third book sort of loses it....,"Hrmm, the first and second books were great, but this third book has a lot of trouble pulling it all together. It also struggles in maintaining the quality of plot and story line. Too bad really; the series started out pretty amazing."
1,Can't understand why there's such a skew in the reviews,"Clearly the ending is a cop out. If it difficult to believe that serious reviewers give it 5 stars.Look, Williams/Dix, go back to the last book, figure out a way to end the otherwise-excellent trilogy without ruining it. So many interesting tenets that it's a crime to end up with something akin to ""and then she woke up..."""
3,Good,"This item is good, but the service is bad. They do not reply your message as soon as possible. And they delay the transportation. But the quality is OK"
1,Total Trash !!!,Hate instigating and prejudicial book.Wouldn't have given it any star but the system won't allow it...
1,biased,"rubbish. when freaks will realize that christianity islam and judaism is one and the same thing with minor technical variations and not condemming each other as heathens. this foolishness has been going on for too long. first it was the evil jews and now its the evil muslims. humans will never stop to discredit, destroy, humiliate, villify a competing religion. well this immaturity needs to taken to task and i ask all people here to really GROW UP!"
5,Outstanding,"This book is a must read. If you would buy only one book this year, this must be it. I have not seen any other author so far that has been able to compose a book on eschatology with this amount of clarity and accuracy. Joel Richardson has it nailed from every angle.He offers keen insights into Islamic eschatology based on Islamic sources. Rather than drawing his own conclusions from the Koran and Sunna, he shows what Islamic scholars have to say about the last days from the Islamic perspective. His understanding of biblical eschatology is startlingly accurate and he avoids many of the pitfalls of classic dispensationalist dogmatism. The parallels are stunning and revealing.His conclusion is as penetrating as his study: pray. Pray, pray, pray and then pray some more. The details of the last days have yet to be revealed and if God's people will humble themselves and pray, who knows? Maybe God will turn and relent in His judgment."
4,Maybe...,"Richardson did a great job interpreting scripture and presented just about every passage in way that made me feel that we are like-minded individuals with a common force driving us. I'm not ready to commit to this idea that Richardson lays forth due to my objection to the way he interprets the 7th and 8th king of Revelation 17 and a few other things, but I believe that Antichrist: Islam's Awaited Messiah is a book that every follower of Christ should consider reading because of the times we live in, and in order to understand the satanic enemy that we are dealing with. They hate America, Jews, Christians and the one true God, Jesus Christ."
3,Lack of Editorial Handling,"The absence of editorial handling was quite distracting. So many grammatical errors, especially toward the end of the book. In the absence of an editor authors should hire professional readers to correct their manuscripts before publication. Unedited books take away from the author's credibility. The subject matter gave much food for thought, but again, the errors raised doubts about the writer's qualifications."
2,"Joel Richardson Has it Wrong. Read ""The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea"" by Tim Cohen Instead!","Joel Richardson has drawn wrong conclusions biblically regarding the coming Anti-Messiah. He and you would be far better served by reading ""The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea"" by Tim Cohen, in which, by the way, Mr. Cohen identifies the coming AntiChrist as a living prince of Roman lineage who also happens to descend directly from Islam's Mohammed! Unlike Mr. Richardson, Mr. Cohen offers hard evidence for his views, and is apparently not speculating on this issue of who the AntiChrist will be.... You must read Mr. Cohen's book if you really want to understand this subject!The Antichrist and a Cup of Tea"
3,Wrong Theology!,Some of the information Joel Richardson provides is of use. But his theology is all wrong. Born again Christians will not see the Wrath of God saved for the nations. We will be raptured before the tribulation.
1,"Wrong impression, this is Shia not sunni!","I wish really that Mr. Richardson would re-study his opinion of Islam. he is referring to the teaching of Shia Muslims, not that of the Sunni....He needs to be more specific. As a Sunni, I am offended. A very uniformed author."
3,Jesus IS Islam's awaited messiah...,"I'm confused about this book...Muslims are waiting for Jesus (peace be upon him) as the messiah, who will kill Dajjal (anti-christ). Imam Mahdi is a secondary figure that helps Jesus against the anti-christ."
1,TRASH PROPAGANDA AND HATE MASQUARADED AS SCHOLARLY WORK.,"THE AUTHOR UNDERSTANDS LESS ABOUT ISLAM THAN THE AVERAGE MUSLIM. HIS BOOK IS FULL OF DISTORTIONS AND LIES. IT APPEALS TO THE CONVERTED HATERS OF ISLAM. DON'T WASTE Y0UR TIME ON GARBAGE. EVEN I, A NON MUSLIM CAN DETECT THE RABID DISDAIN FOR THE ISLAMIC FAITH IN THIS PSEUDO TRASH."
1,Here we go again.....,"Well, here we go again. Yet another ridiculous book on the never ending guessing game, ""who is the anti-christ"" that defies even the very term, ""anti-christ"" now mixed in with some Islamic philosophy that itself has a very weak basis for an ""anti-christ"", or better yet ""messiah"", which is a more contradictory term. The author obviously wishes to jump aboard the guessing game. Well, I have read and re-read a book that I purchased some time ago, Memoir of AntiChrist, which is, I think, also listed here on Amazon, read that book first if you want to have yourself knocked off your feet, then read this book and others like it, and you will see the difference between what seems to be an authentic book on the subject and the rest of the herd."
1,Very biased vision of Islam,"I read this book and have to state that the author is clearly a biased person. Potraying Islam as the religion of war etc. There is in no way any link of the Mahdi being the antichrist. Both Christiantiy and Islam if studied properly are not much different. Their true basis is the basis of love, tolerence and peace. All Muslims await the return of the Mahdi just as true Christians await the second coming of Jesus. Yes there will be an antichrist and in the Muslim doctrine he is called the 'Dajjal'. Where is the Dajjal in this book. The author cannot take liberties on his own personal understanding of a religion. I cannot recommend this book to anyone because it is one of those books that will just brainwash you to believe one mans point of view."
1,Hey Ma! Look! Another Anti-Christ!!,"How many follies in guessing the anti-Christ and end of days will it take for fundies to realize they don't know anything? Bad guess after bad guess for centuries and that doesn't seem to deter some people. Remember when it was the pope? Remember it was the European Union?? tsk tsk tsk.I feel so bad for the people who spent hundreds of dollars on books since 9-11 to only re-inforce what they would have believed anyway in light of steriotypes based on the actions of radicals. Dare I say, the commentors here never read books that represent the other views. I wish I could take a poll of all the commenters on this book to find out who even knows the name John Esposito (Christian) who is an actual scholar. How maybe Michael Sells or Karen Armstrong or many other non-Muslim SCHOLARS.Anyone can take advantage of people's emotions and (as this book shows) faith by contructing a dime-a-dozen conspiracy theory to make a quick buck. How about some objectivity?"
1,0 stars,"This book provides an interesting look into the Islamophobic world of Christian fundamentalist ideology. The fact that the back of this book contains a positive review by Walid Shoebat the con man and pretend ""former PLO terrorist"" (who fleeces money from people to give lectures on his non-existent ""PLO terrorist"" past and spread hatred of Islam ) is telling in and of it itself."
5,Best Resource I have purchased in years.,"I have been interested in, and have studied end time prophecies for years. Many of the issues that I struggled with were suddenly clarified by this book. I found it fascinating, and have recommended it to several friends. I have also passed it to several pastors for their imput. This is a must buy for anyone who wants a ""deep dive"" into Revelations."
2,Beautifully sung but badly produced,"I have nothing but praise for the performance of Dzintars, a Latvian women's chorus, but I am disappointed in how badly this project has been put together. First of all, it is unclear beforehand exactly what is on this CD. I was hoping for a program of traditional folk songs from this corner of the world (which has an amazing wealth of folk music). It turns out to be a mixture of traditional and modern, which is fine - but not what I really wanted. The titles are all given in English, but the chorus sings (thankfully) in Latvian. There is an acoompanying booklet, but it has little useful information and there are no texts and translations. What were the producers thinking??? A program of sung music in a foreign language MUST have texts and translations. The music is lovely, but who knows what they are singing about? The listener has no access to anything beyond pretty sounds. The producers of this CD, Rykodisc, deserve the blame for this botched release."
2,Juvenile Renee Olstead,This CD must have been recorded at age 12. To insinuate this is comparable to the others is stealing. A CRIME
4,By Request,"This product was delivered in a very timely manner, in excellent condition. This young lady has an extrodinary voice and the product shows that off. I would most definately buy from this seller again."
5,Rene Olstead - By Request,This young artist is truly gifted and I'd like to see her make more Jazz CDs.
4,Fun album,"A fun album, Renee has a bright future ahead of her. Her rendition of the Etta James classic ""At Last"" is fantastic and is a nice tribute to Etta without falling into the trap of being pure imitation."
2,Not up to her more recent recordings,"She sounds young in some of the songs, this is not up to the quality of her later recordings"
4,OLD-SCHOOL CROONER IN A TEENAGE BODY [4 STARS],"This album, predating her ""debut"" release, was a recording done of the most-requested songs from her audiences, was recorded when she was all of 13 years of age. Despite her young age, she does a very respectable job with these old jazz and Big Band standards, and is accompanied by top-notch Los Angeles area jazz and swing musicians. Her wonderful voice and ability to emote belies her young age, and she seems equally at home with both jazz and swing. She especially soars on such numbers as ""Georgia On My Mind,"" ""Sentimental Journey,"" and ""At Last."" The only weak track on the whole CD is her cover of ""Over the Rainbow,"" where she sounds a little nasal and flat, but she shines on the rest of the CD.If you want a CD that you can play as background music over a candlelight dinner, then I would highly recommend this one!"
4,Fantastic for such a youg singer,"I am not sure if Renee was even a teenager when she made this CD, but it would be a pretty good CD for a singer of any age, but it is fantastic considering her being in the lower half of teenage when she did it. I was very skeptical of her ability to do a decent ""Georgia on My Mind"", she not only pulled it off, but did an amazing job of doing it. She was not as strong throughout, but where she is more than makes up those."
2,Ho-Hum,"Yawn.Just another performance of Dizzy in a club with nothing special to rave about. If you like Dizzy and are looking for another addition to your collection then, ok buy it. If not, you are not really missing anything."
5,excellent overview of the world of art,"i used this book in an art history course and upon comparison with various other art history texts, it proved itself to be the best resource available. i recieved a perfect score on the art history AP test thanks to this book."
3,Sold few pounds,3 1/2England sounds like one of the few late 70's prog acts able to pay their respects to the masters without regressing into caricature-if sounding slightly contrived in their more ambitious segments- making their obscure status baffling.
5,Movie like an old Rock Hudson/Doris Day Movie. Loved it!,Man Trouble was a lot of fun to watch; it was like watching an old Rock Hudson/Doris Day movie. I would recommend it for a light hearted enjoyable movie.
4,Thanks!,"Book purchased for my student who lost his book (which, of course, was located 1 week after receiving this replacement). Book as described. Nice, fast service."
1,The WORST history text book.,"Oh boy,where to start?I was homeschooled and had this book.And it is without a doubt the WORST history text book ever!!The ""Christian Perspective""is very bitter,cynical,disdainful and mean sprited towrds other cultures that believe in a differnt God.it's like written by a pissed off Ned Flanders on crack.Only a book that bitch Ann Cutlor would apporove.In fact,stay away form all the A beka books.They are like this.Cynical,hateful,dark-souled.Jezz,talk about being Christ like.Shmucks."
1,Don't waste your time buying Bookmans!,"My husband and I bought a Bookman each and we've had nothing but trouble with them! Not only do we have problems with the mechanics of the Bookmans, but we've also had a lot of trouble in dealing with Franklin Publishers' Customer Service in getting them to help us with anything. They send things to the wrong address and charge you the postage for their mistake. In light of all the trouble we've had with our Bookmans and in dealing with Franklin Publishers, you're better off sticking to the Bible in real book form, as it's also easier on the eyes!!"
5,Powerful Tool for Personal Transformation,"I love this CD because it enables me to live more in the flow of life, more joyful and loving. I don't have to force this, it easily and naturally wells up from within. I feel profoundly relaxed and I am reminded on a visceral level of my connection with the Divine.Over this past year I have been troubled with the focus on violence. Through participating in the 4th selection of this CD ""Prayer for World Peace"" I am assisting in creating the peaceful world I want to live in.This CD is an enjoyable, powerful tool for personal transformation."
5,See Griffith's more recent work and impressive reviews,"I strongly urge any readers of Jeremy Griffith's book `Free: The End of The Human Condition' to also look at his 1991 book `Beyond The Human Condition' and probably even more significantly his 2003 book `A Species In Denial', which has become a Bestseller in Australia and New Zealand and continues to receive critical acclaim.These books are also available on www.amazon.com - the Amazon.com page for `A Species In Denial' contains an extraordinarily supportive review from one of the world's leading scientists. I also encourage readers to visit the website www.humancondition.info for even more recent publications and essays by Jeremy Griffith."
4,Nice item if you are Sponge Bob Fan,Nice item that I had not seen before. Price a little high even with being on sale. It was worth it though.
4,Beanie Patrick,You can't have a Spongebob Beanie without getting his best friend Patrick.(At least if you're a kid you want the whole gang.)
2,I like Patrick but my son doesn't!,"I wasn't the brightest when purchasing this, it looked so big in the picture and I love Patrick so I got this for my 2-year-old. He has never been interested in cuddling or using it in pretend play. He does love throwing him though! So there's a positive. But note this is a beanie baby and he's very small!"
4,Good for biking parents of patient children.,"First of all, kudos to Amazon for great customer service. I ordered this trailer shipped ground, and FedEx lost it in KY. They asked me to wait a couple days after the delivery date, and they got me a new shipment shipped next day (Saturday), no charge. That's keeping a customer happy.To the trailer, it's well built with a sturdy aluminum frame. Very easy to assemble, as most of it is already put together. Simple to attach to your bike's rear axle with detailed instructions. Ride seems pretty smooth depending on the pavement, although it doesn't have any springs, so keep in mind how rough the ride will be on your little one, especially if they aren't old enough to tell you. When you're done riding you have the option of removing the quick attach wheels and canopy, and folding up the frame so it lays flat in your trunk. Very well designed."
1,My Child does not like it,"This product might be great for a child that feels comfortable with zero support and is not upset by awkward straps. My son has tried this trailer out probably 10 times in the past year. We were hoping he would grow to like it. The canopy seats offer zero support for his back and the straps are quite awkward. I'm not sure how any kids would like this because my husband and I both feel like we should have spent an extra $100 or $200 for a better quality trailer. If your child is easy to please and is content with most situations, by all means, go for it. If your child is a bit picky and likes to feel supported - I would not recommend this bike. We are going to try and sell it on Craig's List for $50 - $75 to try and recover whatever money we can. Return policy is only 90 days at Target - and we are beyond that."
4,Good value,"Easy to assemble and attach to bike and extra bike attachments available on amazon so it can be used with multiple bikes. Straps for child don't have any padding, but we added our own and it works well. Works fine as a stroller for walking, but probably not great for jogging. Easily detached from bike and easy to put on/take off strolle front wheel with no tools. We store the front wheel upside down on the attachment arm so if we bike somewhere we can convert to stroller mode. Does well at keeping baby out of bad weather, but not great at shading from bright sunshine. All and all, good value."
4,Great trailer,"I recently purchased the Schwinn Trailblazer Double as a 2nd trailer to keep at my parents' house. We also own a Chariot double. For the price,the Schwinn gets the job done.Positives - it folds VERY flat and compactly and is easy to fold (even while holding a squirming 11 month old), it is light, good ventilation, snack pockets, nice storage bin, handle bar can be set for different height parent, snap cover is easy to put on/take off, the front ""arm"" folds in for a very small ""folded footprint""Negatives - no shocks so is a bumpy ride, the front wheel is not very sturdy (when I ran with it, I tilted the stroller so the wheel was off the ground), small sling-style seat so the kids sit very close together, straps are not very adjustable and can be difficult to clip on/off, cannot be fitted with an infant sling, no sun shadeAll-in-all, a great stroller. I would consider this as our only trailer if we didn't already have a Chariot."
1,Design flaw on attachment - Not safe!!!,"We used this trailer for a few months and noticed that there is significant wear on the al tube that inserts to the coupler attached to the bike. You have the coupler rubbing against the Al tube which is slowly putting a cut into the Al tube. It has not failed yet, but I don't trust having my kids in there anymore. Customer Service is not helpful at all. After 2 months of going back and fourth they are not able to provide any solution and decline that there is a problem with this design. Apparently they have not seen this before in their tests. Strange, there are two other trailers at our daycare with the same attachment mechanism and both show the same damage.Do not buy this product or any other schwinn, instep. trailer that uses this attachment mechanism. Spend the extra $ and go for a different brand. They all use a different attachment mechanism."
4,Dad will be pulling this thing!,"It is what it is. I decent trailer. The latching system for the kids is the worse though. We can not figure a way to hold the children in securely.Also, it's a tough pull on hilly roads. Very enjoyable on flat ground though!"
1,Broke After 3 Rides,I purchased this item in December and only used it three times. One of the little plastic black knobs on where the frame connects to the canopy broke of. Now the item is unusable.
2,"Philosophical Papers: Volume I (Philosophical Papers (Oxford)) ,","letters are too small ; too much detais ;no great lines of thoughts;rather chaotic; not persuasive reasoning, of course it only my personal view, these views are not intended to be publisch on world periodicals !"
5,"Love it, love it",I have used this product for years and love it. It makes tons of lather and the cloths have two different sides depending on your needs. It takes off makeup and rinses completely. I have used others and they simply don't compare.
2,NOT true to size!,"I love Skechers shoes! I own a pair and wear them most every day! When I found a great deal on these I was so excited by the price that I ordered a pair right away! They are pretty but are NOT true to size! I ALWAYS wear a size 7 - but these fit more like a size 6! VERY tight and wasting away in my closet, now. If you purchase these - go a size up - at least!"
5,"Outstanding, emotionally intense read.","This is one of the best romances of any genre I've read this year, and by far the best short contemporary romance I've read in a couple of years. I'm always looking for an intense emotional connection between the hero and heroine in a romance, and this book has that in spades. Max is a wonderful hero: powerful and magnetic, generous and protective of his family and friends, and sexy as heck! I'm definitely going to be looking for other titles by this talented author!"
3,Lot's of questions but still not enough!,I recommend this book for my students but they need to use another material as well like Test out and Transcender.
1,NIP HAS FALLEN OFF,"Ya know it's good to see him trying after the split up with RAP-A-LOT but this is just a sad day for me to say this but this C.D. [stinks],real bad too. In the past NIP has proven himself to be one of the best ever gory story tellers.The beats don't match NIP's hardcore heartfelt lyrics at all!!! Well in my book he will be remembered and I'll just keep on bumpin his old stuff. R.I.P N-I-P"
1,Garbage Nip,"i gave it my best shot. but after playing this album twice in it's entirety, i have to conclude that it is terrible. its sad but true. the tracks are wack. there's one cut called pimp ni**as. it alright, but still missing that uh! i copped it becuz i'm a die hard fan. but if you've never heard it and you're desperately trying to find a copy, search no more. it's not worth it."
3,Decent sander,"Overall this an OK sander, it leaves a good finish but has a few shortcomings as well. The switch is difficult to operate, the dust tends to vibrate off, generates to much noise and vibration for my liking. The dust collection is only fair and you cant hook up a vaccum without buying an optional adapter. If you are in the market for a new sander i strongly suggest giving a Random Orbit a try, they are far superior to a sheet sander."
3,Needs a better switch.,"This sander is works well if you can get it turned on. The power switch is small, rubber covered with very little difference from the on to off position making it difficult to turn on without pressing hard several times. Then just when you think the get the switch on and the sander runs it shuts itself off. It is also difficult to shut off after you get it on. DeWalt uses the same switch in all of their orbital disc and palm sanders, not a good thing. I would have expected DeWalt to use a better switch for the money that I paid, considering a good switch is about $1. I should have bought the Porter Cable that has a standard rocker or toggle switch."
3,"Good, but turns itself on","I like my DW411 sander. But, it sometimes turns itself on. I have to be careful to keep it unplugged when I am not using it and especially if I leave it alone, even for a few minutes. It got me again this last week when I went upstairs for dinner and came down and found it running."
4,Good sander,"I purchased this sander because or old sander, a Black & Decker, died while we were sanding our cabinets. So far this sander has performed well - we are doing minor remodeling on our kitchen. Therefore, I believe the old saying ""lo barato sale caro"" (i.e. just shell out the extra bucks & get a Dewalt rather than a Black & Decker)."
4,Less vibration,I'm a painting contractor and I started using this model sander several years ago. I usually use Makita but I found the Dewalt runs a little smoother (maybe slower) and is less tiring on the hand. My guys seem to prefer using the dewalt over makita
3,Don't waste your $$$$,"Poor design. The dust bag is a joke, as it seems to be with all of DeWalt's tools. The sand paper plate for stick on paper is rediculous. Save your $$$$ and your time and purchase an orbital sander."
1,The first and last DeWalt tool in my shop,"This was the first and last DeWalt power tool in my shop. The serious flaw is an unpredictable switch. Since it was new I sometimes had to fiddle with it for it to stay on. Even more of a pain, it often turns on by itself (on one occasion over five minutes after I shut it off and was all of the way across the room). The one star is to give it some credit for not stopping after a suicide leap off of the workbench. It is a blessing it is a palm sander and not a more dangerous tool."
4,great finishing sander,"This was the first power sander that I bought and I've been generally pleased with it. I can get an incredibly smooth finish with it and it manages to collect most (but not all) of it's dust. I also like the fact that it uses standard sanding paper -- no need for special paper, some of which can get quite expensive.I should point out that this is truly a finishing sander. I wrongly thought I could just put lower grit sandpaper on it and use it for more aggressive sanding. Not so. But it does a great job at what it was designed for -- very fine sanding."
4,"Sands well, reasonably priced","This little tool sands well and gets into tight spots, but it runs into trouble if your holding it horizontally (sanding baseboard, etc.). The dust bag immediately lets go and falls to the floor. It's more of an irritant that a major problem as the dust collection isn't that great anyway. For the money, it's a pretty good sander and unlike the Makita model, it does hold up."
4,Tiny Mite,"Great little brute, Ive tried to stall it out but it just wouldn't stop. It handles 36Grit with no problem.The only drawback is the dust it creates is more than that little bag is going to hold. Get the the sweeper attachment part #DW4111 worth the money if your going to use this in the house or shop. that is why I give it a 4 star. Amazon.com should sell the attachment !!!! hint."
4,For the general public,"This movie describes the competition between J. Craig Venter (Celera) and Eric Lander (MIT) trying to decode the genome first. It is old and it does not cover all the way until they finished in 2003. It describes the big difference between government vs. private funded research and the controversies on trying to patent gene sequences, etc. It is a very informative movie and gives the foundation to understand new things related to the genome that are being discovered in the present as advances in the proteome, etc. It clears the mind to describe that although sequencing the genome has been one of the biggest discoveries of the 21th century, it is not the cure for anything, but a door for the future to cure of many diseases. By the way, I thing Eric Lander is the best speaker I ever heard and you just must see him to understand why I say that.The only complain I have is that some of the interviews are a bit slow and the questions could have been better."
2,Cracking the Code of Life,"You have heard the term, ""talking heads?"" Well, this is the personification of that term. I bought this DVD for a genetics class I teach. It is a long video with a great deal of wasted time on very little.My students hated it."
2,Very simple,"Very simple. I expected a better contribution in the field of science per se; and i found that is oriented to ethics. Regards, Madya Ayala"
2,I Wish I'd Skipped This One,"The plot of this book seemed promising at first but it soon turned into just a mildly interesting story. Only one character, Captain Sara Brannon, had any real spark. Several errors throughout the book were distracting and annoying. For example. How could a handcuffed woman kick a man in the thigh when her jeans have just been pulled down to her knees? An average story, poorly written."
2,Heavily Contrived,"This is sort of a Western in a Procedural Mystery guise. A Western in the mythos sense. A lot of what happens is not really credible. If you read the book, count the number of times that person A has the drop on person B, only to have B's confederate show up in the nick of time and reverse the situation. The romantic interest, Sara, turns out to be to be not only a tough, intelligent Army cop with survival and martial arts skills, she is also an expert horsewoman. And the villain kidnaps her without a good reason. He isn't planning to hold her hostage, nor does she know or have something he needs. Maybe he intended to tie her to the railroad tracks. And I'm not sure, but I think the author got some of his Native American customs wrong, mixing up Navajo and Tewa (Pueblo) beliefs and attibuting petroglyphs created by the Mogollon people to the Apaches."
3,I really wanted to love this book....,"Through out this book, I couldn't decide whether I liked it or not. There is good action and the description of the southwest was good. I just couldn't figure out where it was headed. There were too many characters to keep track of. And in some parts, you weren't sure where Kerney was or what he was doing.I'm not giving up on this though, I'm going to read more. I'm sure he gets better."
3,Promising First Effort,"Somwhat contrived plot, but excellent sense of place and the beginnings of good dialogue. Most notable is the absence of any tough-guy nonsense in McGarrity's main character who also has an uncommonly enlightened attitude toward women and others. A solid first book with promise for later efforts."
3,Good plot but mediocre writing,"I really wanted to like this book: the plot is interesting, it's set in a fascinating and off-the-beaten-track part of New Mexico, the characters are a great cross-section of NM, and the author is a heck of a nice guy (I've met him socially). BUT the writing is flat, there are careless errors (on one page someone jumps out of a window; on the next page the same incident is described again, and this time the guy sneaks out the back door!), and I found the female characters predictable (either Madonnas or sexpots). It's a Chinese dinner of a book: spicy and exciting, but not very satisfying (you're hungry again an hour later)."
2,Not expecting anything left me not expecting anything,"This book has a lot of potential, but I was disappointed overall with the plot and the characters. The descriptions of landscapes made them real and inviting, and the addition of watercolor paintings made it that much more vivid. The offbeat coloquialisms made it interesting, in some repects, but I still think this novel falls short of the people and places described within its pages.The plot seemed dull, and there wasn't any real who-dunit story that weaves a reader into a web. I thought this was more like an episode of ""Columbo"" where you already knew who did it, and it was just a matter of catching the bad guys. The clues found by the detectives seemed haphazard and that they just happened to bump into things by chance. The dialogue seemed natural for a TV show, but not all bad.All in all, I'd like to see more of McGarrity as he hones his technique, but it's decent for a first try."
5,Good read,First time I had read anything by Michael McGarrity. Growing up in New Mexico I found it agood book. Enjoyed it.
4,Riveting,Great mystery book. Fast paced and riveting. Couldn't put it down once I started reading. Plot rather fantastic...great imagination. Love scenes come across rather weakly but descriptive narrative ranks up there with the best of them. Written by someone who truly loves New Mexico and has feeling for the land.
3,Going back in time to start the Kerney series...,"I found the plot of Tularosa to be a little contrived, but the authentic feel of New Mexico has obviously been present in McGarrity's series from the beginning.Kerney and Sara Brannon are easy to like and have a well-paced relationship in the book. There was a lot of gratuitous violence south of the border; but probably this is based in what the author has really found in his career in law enforcement in the southwest.McGarrity struggles a little with his writing style - he paints a scenic picture well, but was just starting out in character development and dialogue.Worth the read to start the Kerney series; the author continues to develop and satisfy the reader."
4,A good read...........,This is an interesting book with a lot of strong characters. I enjoy books set in the southwest. I served at Fort Bliss for about a year. The story had some interesting ideas and is believable.It is fiction not history.
5,Great Understanding of Southern New Mexico,"My favorite, having grown up in and around Alamogordo and Las Cruces. Mcgarrity truly understands the geography and people of this area, and the scenes around Tularosa are pitch-perfect."
3,Just Okay,"Not bad, I guess, for a first book, but realistically, it was just average. I don't know why -- interesting characters, great setting -- but somehow it didn't come together for me. I guess I found the plot dull and unexciting. I found the writing predictable, but formulaic. As other reviewers have stated, the book seemed contrived. But -- I've read worse. I'll try McGarrity again. I hope his subsequent offerings are better than this average effort."
1,Lyrics Lacking,"In my english class at South Burlington High School we were doing a poetry unit. Our teacher was talking about quality of poetry--bad, in particular--and said how so many high school age kids write complete doggerel that they think is brilliant because they're showing emotion. He went off on how bad this stuff is, and we all agreed: a couple of us immediately thought of none other than Dan Blockhead. SO, I printed out some of his lyrics from his website and brought them into our class, and our teacher said that this was exactly what he was talking about and we all enjoyed a good chuckle. Dan, please learn how to write lyrics before you make any more music."
1,"more Dean, less Dan","Dan Block seezes my deez. We need more Dean, less Dan. Dan always screws everything up. Dean cools everything up. Get the picture? Duh"
2,The info on this page is incorrect.,"The Roman poet Lucan wrote this epic about the war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great. The Echo Library edition is incorrectly identified on this page as the Joyce translation. It is not, but is an old, public domain translation by Sir Edward Ridley. I've notified amazon about the error. The modern translation by Joyce is available on amazon from another publisher."
4,Does what it is supposed to,This is a good case. Works as intended. The outside is durable and tough. It comfortably holds a Ruger 10/22 with a scope attached.
4,Allen Company Ruger 10/22 Scoped Rifle Case (40-Inch),This is a great case for the Ruger 10/22. It fits gun and scope perfectly and is the correct length. I don't think you could find a better gun case for the price.
1,disappointing,"Bought this for my unscopped Ruger 10/22. I didn't open it more then 10 times before one of the little wires in the zipper bent, and now I cannot close it at all. Extremely disappointing. Overall it is cheaply made. Only buy it if you HAVE to have a case and need one cheap."
3,rifle case,"The product is good, not what I needed.I was hoping it had pockets for storing rifle information, etc."
5,Excellent!,"Are you kidding? This is a solid, basic case. Like you'd expect to get for $50 to $65 at you local gun shop. It's $23, how does it get less than 5 stars? Thick padding, solid construction, good solid zipper, custom logo Ruger 10-22 case. No pockets. No wheels. No windows, or little pockets to put shipping tags in. No hard case sections. No cupholder. It's just a basic rifle case, and my wife's scoped 10-22 is very happy inside. 8^)"
4,Ruger 10/22 Rifle case by Allen Co.,This is a nice basic rifle case for my 10/22 rifle. It is big enough to accompany your scoped 10/22. Delivery was fast and as promised. I am happy with the purchase.
5,Nice quality/Nice price,Better quality/protection than most soft rifle cases you will find in sporting/department stores at a low price. Fits my 10/22 perfectly.
3,10/22 Case,Had the case for about a year then the stitching deteriorated and the handles fell off. I expected a little more from it.
4,Perfect fit for my 10/22,"Bought this case at Bass Pro Shop when I picked up my 10/22. Obviously, it fits perfectly with or without the scope (as you would expect). Some of the generic cases are pretty long for the 10/22. The quality looks to be very good and frankly it looks pretty cool, with the Ruger factory colors and embroidered logo. The only issue I have with this is the lack of any sort of pockets. It would be nice to have a place to store extra magazines, tools, etc... But for the price, I can't complain. I would definitely buy this case again."
5,Great fit for rifle and scope,"Purchased for my Ruger 10/22 that has a 3 to 7 variable scope mounted on it. The fit,quality and construction make this a great value. I'm very happy."
5,Nice Bag,The bag seems to be of good quality. My Race Rifle had not problem fitting with scope mounted. It can be found for a cheaper price at othe shops.
2,Okay...BUT...,"I was disappointed to find this case has no capability of adding a small padlock.If you carry a rifle out in Caliornia, you better have the case locked.(Until the NRA sues the Peoples Republic of California for yet another infringement on The Right to Bear Arms)."
4,10 22 case,this fit the rifle like it was made for it. I would have liked to have had a pocket on the outside
1,Not Even Good for a Concert,"A concert version of a smattering of G&S; tunes is a questionable concept from the outset, I suppose, but this presentation is definitely poor even for a concert version. At least one of the main vocalists doesn't even stay synchronized with the orchestra very well.Two actors pretending to be Gilbert and Sullivan, watching from the box above, make running historical-tidbit commentary about the creation of the operas that is corny but is probably the best part of the tape. One calls the other ""my dear,"" which I assume accurately reflects the way they spoke at the time."
2,"This is a concert view, not an opera presentation.","This is a 1982 A(I think) concert that is done with a youth orchestra (although they are very gooed) and a somewhat disjointed choir. If this is what you expect it is fine. However if you are looking for a staged opera, this is NOT the disk for you."
4,I got what I hoped to get.,"This DVD presents a concert version of the best hits from Gilbert & Sullivan. It was exactly what I was expecting and I am very happy with the DVD.I do have one minor criticism. While the microphones for the major singers were fine, the chorus did not come through as well as I had hoped. On the other hand, having actual members of the D'Oyly Carte Singers perform was better value than I expected. Vivian Tierney did a particularly nice job on a selection from The Pirates of Penzance.True, if you want a full performance of these operettas, you should buy just that for each of them. However, I think this DVD is a good deal for someone who wants a few highlight songs from each of the best of Gilbert & Sullivan."
3,"Looks cool, fits well, but did not last","I was really pleased with this when it first arrived. The fit was really good; structured shoulder, fitted through the torso. The graphic was good too, crisp, clean, simple. Lots of people noticed it and complimented it.The first time I washed it (cold water, gentle cycle,) the screen printed white cross completely fell apart, leaving it looking like a years-old sweatshirt. Perhaps this was just a fluke that only applied to my shirt, but I don't know for sure. And I have not contacted the company to give them the opportunity to replace it; I have just been too busy, so that is my bad.I still wear it just for chores around the house, but it is disappointing that it just did not hold up for me."
3,Jefferson discredited,"I was disappointed to find Wilkins' harp on Jefferson's shortcomings, and his absurd suggestion that the Declaration was written for ""the gentleman English class"". It's as if the Declaration should read, as Lincoln said in his Dred Scott Speech: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident that all British subjects whom were on this continent eighty-one years ago, were created equal to all British subjects born and then residing in Great Britain"". True, Jefferson had what Madison called a ""pliability of principal"" but not to include numerous Jefferson primary sources to present a more objective view of Jefferson's reasoning on slavery is poor scholarship."
1,Advancing a Tired Agenda via Deconstruction,"Professor Wilkins writes polemic rather than history and, as such, his scholarship is slanted to produce a predetermined result. As usual, it results in an attempt at discrediting the ideas and ideals of the Founding Fathers by pointing out their human flaws rather than their courage,hopes and aspirations for the country they created."
3,Not her best work,"I agree with the editorial review that says the book feels more purposeful than compelling. The idea of fighting to save small businesses is a good base for a book, but it dominates all aspects of this work. The characters do seem rather flat, with what dimension they have thrown in to try to help the reader ignore their unnatural single-mindedness. I became tired of the activist rhetoric at times, and Nye's creations seemed a bit fake upon close examination - who says that ""teenage activists"" have to conform to unusual styles of dress, be superartsy, and have strange names? What carries this book along is an honest love of cool little neighborhood businesses, and the tenderness with which the author renders them."
1,"Oh, spare me...","I hate preachy books, and this one takes preachyness to this whole new strange level. Apperently big buisnesses are horrible,and everyone who works for them is too. And Florrie's such an idealist and single minded there's very little realism. The book loves to blow everything out of perportion.The names are also annoying. Florrie, True, Zip, Ramsey, etc, it's as if the author decided that creativity was important. The author also seems afraid of using normal human speech.The cconversations aree unrealistic and stiff. I honestly finished this book just so i could review it.I'm tired of all this nonsense about beauty being only skin deep. That's deep enough. What do you want, an adorable spleen?-This qoute comes from a relativily famous person."
4,This is the book that taught me about Native Plants.,"I always assumed that many of the plants I saw along the road were native plants. This is a very valuable resource for anyone who would like to know what they are seeing every day on their commute or on a trip through the state. I always carry a copy in my car. The landscape is so much more beautiful when you know something about it! It also helped when my son brushed against stinging nettles and developed a temporary welt. Start with this book, then become a lover and defender of our most important heritage."
3,Imagine Joni Mitchell backed up by Toto...,"...And you get a good idea of the 80's sounding band on this DVD. All the ""rockers"" have that ham-fisted, 80's show-off session man sound. (The guitarist being the most guilty of Journey/Styx/Starship crimes against humanity.)I recommend renting, not buying, this DVD for the bliss and inspiration of Sweet Bird of Youth, Refuge of the Roads, For Free and the overlooked Chnese Cafe (best song from the Wild Things album). Sorry, but the home movies grate after a while, and the interspersing of early clips of Joni serve no real purpose.Someday, someone will compile the best live stuff from this, Shadows and Light, Isle of Wight, 1998 Soundstage, 1960's TV shows and unreleased early 70's performances, and that will be a gem worth any price they charge."
3,Lots of British hits,"I wanted to know what was on this CD so I looked at www.amazon.co.uk (the British component of Amazon.com) and it had the following songs listed. I only remember about 6 of the 20, but the ones I do know are great songs!1. Word up - Cameo (1)2. Ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent - Guthrie, Gwen3. Down to earth - Curiosity Killed The Cat4. Addicted to love - Palmer, Robert5. Breakout - Swing Out Sister6. You keep me hangin' on - Wilde, Kim7. Eloise - Damned8. World shut your mouth - Cope, Julian9. Look away - Big Country10. Higher love - Winwood, Steve11. Honeythief - Hipsway12. Because of you - Dexys Midnight Runners13. Lady in red - De Burgh, Chris14. Ocean blue - ABC15. I'm not gonna let you (get the best of me) - Colonel Abrams16. I'm chillin' - Kurtis Blow17. Lessons in love - Level 4218. Mine all mine - Ca$hflow19. Mr Big Stuff - Heavy D & The Boyz20. Too good to be forgotten - Amazulu"
4,What you see is what you get.,"What can I say, it's a crib dust ruffle. The color and quality were nice."
5,A must see for serious film lovers,"For too long some of James Purdy's work has been unavailable, either ignored or neglected, but surprisingly his novel In a shallow grave was made into a film, which surprisingly considering Hollywood standards it was translated to the screen with the characters retaining the same feelings and sentiments from the written words, of course there were some changes along the way, but it is still a movie worth watching. This movie should have had a wider audience, but as it is with serious films as this one, it does take someone willing to embrace it with an open mind. The viewer wiil have the opportunity of finding an excellent film and also discover what a wonderful writer James Purdy is."
4,A great toy!,"We've had this for over a year and my 4 yr. old son is still playing with it. He loves recording his voice. I love this toy because we have had no problems with it and although it's bulky, it's very light weight."
5,Rescue Heroes: Command Center,"I have two boys, 4 and 2, that love this toy! With the multi-level play, they actually share! I think the most fun for them is being able to record their own emergency messages. We have most of the Rescue Heroes action figures and accessories. These toys are able to withstand the roughest play!"
5,great,This is great. I bought this for my son last Christmas and it is still in one piece. Both my son and daughter love all the Rescue Heroe toys. They play with them all the time and they have lasted.
5,Great toy!,"My 4 y/o boy just loves this. In fact all the rescue hero ""stuff"" is outstanding! I would highly recommend it to any boy or girl. (some of the heros are women) great toy."
3,Voice recorder highly entertaining,"Both my four year old and two year old find the voice record feature of the ""command centre"" highly entertaining. Be aware that an actual rescue hero does not come with the centre - good thing we had one on-hand as a ""rainy day"" toy. Otherwise, they don't play with it much except for the spiralling tower, which is very cool and holds up pretty good when they are both playing with it."
5,One of the best!,"My three-year-old son received this as well as the beginnings of his Rescue Heroes collection this Christmas. Although the product hasn't yet been subjected to the rigors of extended years of play, we are impressed by its construction as well as the interactive aspect of recordable messages and the impressive attention to detail in the ""surround sound"" feature of the helicopter noise effect. Just from his initial reaction it's easy to see that this toy will easily retain his interest for some time to come - kudos to Fisher Price for another hit. ..."
3,Command center,"My son got this for Christmas last year, and within a week the front part of it was falling apart. I finally threw that little piece away, and my son didn't even miss it. The best feature on this, is the recorder that records a minute of whatever you say, and can be played back by just pressing a button. The sirens are neat to play with too, but for the cost, I don't think it is very durable. At Wal-Mart, they sell it with one rescue hero, and a rescue hero video for a price of $20. Overall, if you get this item, shop around. For the price, it should come with something other than just the command center. He doesn't play with this anymore, and I just bought him the aqua command center, to see if he likes the new one better. Only time will tell!"
3,what a headache,We got this for my 4 year old brother for christmas and while my dad worked on another toy i got stuck building this thing. 3 hours of work on this tower and my brother decided to play with another toy. he has never used it for any longer than 15 min.waist of money but mostly your time.
5,My new favorite game!,"coming from someone that has only played the original cranium once, I was blown away by the Turbo edition. It was amazing to see how everyone was so into the game play even when it wasn't their turn. The types and variety of questions made this game a lot of fun and continuously interesting. Cranium brings aspects of all your favorite games into one! Even the modeling clay smelled nice! The actual gameplay was very easy to understand. The only drawback was the timer/question selector. We had to silence it a bit and it took some time for everyone to figure out how long to hold it down for it to work. It was also a bit hard to hear over it during the singing questions. overall - a GREAT game that could never get old!"
1,Disappointed,"We love playing cranium and expected this game to be even better, but when we opened the box there were no green turbo rally cards. It is no fun to play w/o all the cards. We were given two decks of red cards instead. I am SO VERY DISAPPOINTED! I am currently trying to contact the manufacturer to correct the problem, but still, the ordeal has been a waste of my time."
5,So much fun!,"I brought this game to our friends' game night and oh we had so much fun with this game. This game involved from acting, drawing, singing to mind-teasing and so much more. I'm glad I bought this game."
5,Fun Had By All,"This is a great game to play in a group, both individually and/or in teams. I had this game shipped to my daughter's dorm room at NYU and she now hosts Cranium Nights! The game requires a certain amount of luck, strategy and skill, and the participants need to be able to make fools of themselves in order to act out the various loopy challenges. OUr family is very competitive and this is our favorite board game (other than scrabble)! Hope you enjoy it as well! Cheers!"
2,Get out your wire clippers,"The obnoxious timer plays horribly obnoxious music. I had to open up the thing with a screwdriver and cut the wires to the little speaker. It was easy to but annoying.otherwise it is a great game, but if you sdont want to do surgery get the regular edition."
3,Needs more alcohol,"We tried playing this game at a new years eve party. while there were interesting elements, about halfway through the game, we took a potty break and never came back to it. the consensus was that to be a fun game, it needed more players (we had 8) and more alcohol."
2,The good and the bad.,"I have had this tool for several years now and bought it mostly because of the Dewalt name. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to expectations. First, 6 inch hook and loop pads are becoming harder to find. It seems that 5 inch pads are the current craze, especially adhesive pads. Secondly, this tool is noisy and heavy. It is hard think of it as a finishing sander. The collection bag is a joke and must have been designed by the team of Moe, Larry and Curly. The wire that gives the bag it's shape and stiffness poked a hole in the fabric the second day I used it. Very poor design. Not worthy of the Dewalt name. Its only saving grace is that due to its weight it will take rough stock off quickly."
2,My first random orbit,After using orbital sanders for years I decided to get the random orbit. I have been a big fan of Dewalt and did not hesitate on purchasing this tool. The dust collection for the most part does not work. The sanding qualities are first class. But six inch paper is hard to find. But I stocked up when I bought the sander. I have had to replace the switch after it quit working. Overall It sands well but fails in the dust collection department. Dewalt could do better.
3,"good sander, but has some flaws","I've done a fair bit of sanding with this product and overall, the sanding is good: good removal of wood with minimal swirl marks (just don't short cut through the grits). The flaws are two: the wire support for the dust bag wore through the bag so now while sanding it spews a steam of dust through the hole. Second is the power switch. Every once in a while the thing won't turn on. I've found that if you take the sander apart you can pull the power switch out and then take that apart. Blow the dust out and put it all back together and it works again. Call me crazy, but a sander with a switch that fails because of wood dust seems to be a bit of a design flaw.."
1,?,I had the same product for 3 years ! I purchase a new one and it fell apart After 2 weeks ????????? Not happy
5,An Excellent Book,I bought the book yesterday and started off with the first chapter. The next thing I remember is that I am done with the book and I feel some degree of mastery over the subject. The author deserves a standing ovation. Dont forget to have JXTA platform API documentation and code examples to go along with your reading
5,Tour de Force Ellison Compilation,"This is simply the most thorough and compelling compilation of Ellison's works. Period. It runs the gamut of all his works, from the early days, until the date of the compilation's publication. By far, its a must have for anyone who appreciates Ellison. PERIOD."
3,Easy To Read and Very Informative,"I haven't taken the exam yet, but I used this book for self study. I knew nothing about networks until I read this book. I learned a lot from it."
5,better than expected!!,"Bought this item to help build an oak framed screen door for the front of our house, which ended up being a total of $210, in comparison to the models on line at $900 (including delivery. This biscuit joiner worked wonders and with little ease. I've never used one, but after experimenting on scrap wood it performed wonderfully and allowed us to build the door of our dreams. Thanks Amazon and DeWalt for such a grrrrrreat product."
2,Not so accurate,"I purchased this to replace a Porter Cable 555. First, the fence was out of square. Next, the cuts were approximately 0.020 out on one edge. When you put the boards together, you have to overcome 0.040 total error. Using this to edge boards would be quite the chore. I sent the tool back as not accurate enough for fine woodworking."
4,"Very Usable, Tough, but Chip Collection Problematic","This was one of my most-used tools until I started using pocket hole joinery. At that point, biscuits took on more of a specialty role for me. My DeWalt 682 has seen a lot of use, though, and is still as tight as new. It comes with an excellent blade that stays sharp for a VERY long time, and the tool has plenty of power - it feels effortless.I have only one complaint about this tool, and that's its dust & chip collection. The outlet is a bit small and plugs when using the bag. So badly, in fact, that I've taken to clearing it out after every few holes. I use the tool with a vac whenever possible, and the port stays clear."
3,Good Solid Tool at a good Price,"Have not had it long or used it very much, however it does a very good job. I had to do a lot of set up adjustment at first before I could use it; the angular set points were not accurate at 90 deg nor at 45 deg. I had to set with a square and adjust set pointers by filing to get an accurate set up. This was a disappointing fact, because my other DeWalt tools are well engineered."
1,Incomplete Design and Testing before release,"The advantage of the DeWalt is that it's a generally a good package at a modest price. The down side is that it's extremely noisy. The pitch will remind you of the dentist chair every time you run it, but the worst feature is that the motor cooling vent is on top of the machine, and you will get a blast of air/dust in the face and eyes because of their chosen design, it's a real pain.The DeWalt does the job, but along with the non-precise travel after adjustment and tightening in the fence I would recommend the PC or Lamello. I recently purchased the PC 557K because of the lousy Dewalt design and dumped the Dewalt at a second hand tool store and laughed all the way, to pick up my new PC several months ago."
4,A must have,"I recently bought this item and have been impressed by its performance. It does a great job at making the biscuit slots and is easy to use. My only gripe is with the dust collector. The dust was always getting stuck in the port. However, when I removed the dust collector, the problem was solved."
1,Dewalt is no Porter-Cable,"Because this unit was $50 cheaper than the Porter-Cable, I thought I would give it a shot. Bad idea. The Porter-Cable has more angle settings and more power which make a cleaner cut in hard woods. The Dewalt fence is feable and is easily prone to damage. Plus, out of the box, the Dewalt fence was not square. Buy the Porter-Cable for the extra money and get the job done right the first time."
3,Reasonable,"Plate jointer is an interesting tool. The rotational axis of blade is perpendicular to the axis of motor, thus there is a gear mechanism that changes the rotational direction. For this reason, the tool is noiser than other power tools, and you get a lateral jerk when it gets started. At the same time, the precision of the tool is easily revealed by a planer joinery. It is hard to find one that meets everything.I have compared it with Porter Cable and Makita. I like Dewalt's design that allows both one hand and two hand operation. When every part is in good condition, it works reasonably well. However, I can't understand why the cut depth is much deeper than the biscuit size. In my opinion, Makita is the best among three for its design, smooth plunge, and no lateral jerk."
3,"Decent tool, but poor quality control","I owned this joiner for a short while. Luckily, I purchased it at my local Home Depot so returning it was not a problem - only the tool was. The problem with mine was that the fence was not parallel with the blade. It may be possible to adjust this, but I could not readily determine how to do this. The fence was not set square (90 degrees) from the factory either, but that is easily adjusted. The fence problem combined with a loud motor prompted my decision to return it. To be fair to DeWalt, I opened every other one in stock at the store; they all had the same problem. This may have just been a problem with the batch that my store received. On the plus side, it was light and easy to operate. The dust collection worked well with just the bag, and the ""rack and pinion"" fence adjustment was a plus."
5,OUTSTANDING TOOL....A MUST HAVE!!!,"As a weekend wood worker, I was in need of a biscuit joiner. As a devoted DeWalt tools owner, this has to be one of my favorite tools in my garage. It is very easy to handle and use. I HIGHLY recommend this biscuit joiner to the anyone from the beginner wood worker to the expert craftsman.DerekColorado Springs, Colorado"
5,plate joiner,The planer joiner was purchased as a Christmas gift for my Son who will be using it in his carpentry business. He was very pleased with it.
3,Good for the money,"I used it on my first piece and everything came out fine. The front brace has a little play to it, and it feels a little flimsy. The motor also sounds a little rattly. For the price, though, the results are acceptable."
4,"Easy to use, comfortable to handle, but dusty without vacuum","This is my first biscuit jointer. I was leaning towards the PC 557 when I started looking, but after I visited local store and handled both, I picked this one. Not only saved [money], but this one is more comfortable to handle to me and the trigger switch is awesome to use. And for the things I make, I won't need the smaller knife anyway. The only problem with this machine is the dust control. The dust bag does not work at all. It will make a mess after a few cuts and get the chips all over my face. So I picked up Porter Cable 39332 Vacuum Hose for 1"" O.D. Dust Ports and couple of adapters hooked up to my Jet dust collector since DeWalt does not make any of those. Now I am a very happy camper."
3,Beware of slot cutter alignment,"I have used this tool now for about a year. The ease of the biscuit joint concept is outstanding and the DeWalt is a good tool--However--be sure the slot cutter is aligned to give parallel slots, mine is not, was not out of the box. It was slightly off which I did not notice immediately,i.e. one side of the slot was about 1/32 higher than the other. Now after nearly a year the slot varies 1/16 which makes it tough to get smooth joints. The problem is in the guide slot inside the body and the error can be seen by looking into the slot opening. I am waiting to see if DeWalt comes through with a fix or Porter Cable here I come."
1,dewalt biscuit joiner issue,"This product is poorly built. The stop is made with flimsy pot metal about 1 mm thick. Mine broke after 1 use. Just looking at it you can see it is weak but I could not from the internet pictures. Harbor Freight, Makita,Hitachi, and Ryobi have a better products at less than half the price!"
4,Great Tool,"I order this tool for a special project and was ready to use it as soon I got it out of the box. I started to cut the first joint and the handle collasped forward and smashed by fingers. On closer inspection I found that the threads in one side of the handle were stripped completely out. With care I continued to use the tool to finish the project. Later I filled the hole with metal epoxy and re-threaded it. I am sure dewalt would have made it good but I didn't have time. Somewhat dissapointed but the tool works great if you keep your fingers ""from between the bricks"""
5,Buy For Your Needs,"This tool was a great buy for me: I needed a plate joiner for occassional use, one that cuts square and is accurate in its settings; It has done a beuatiful job each time. It is loud, the dust bag is not worth the trouble, its a fuss to get it back in its carry-box and setting the the x and y depth coordinates precisely takes extra care. Once set, it does stay put.Where your money is better spent if you do a lot of this work is with a high end tool. The Lamello is a silkier setup at a much bigger price: but you make up the cost on time and hassle savings.For my purpose, I'd buy the DeWalt again."
4,best choice for moderate use,I won't bore you with repeating the specs or features of the biscuit joiner as the other reviews cover them quite well. I've had this tool for about 6 months now and am delighted with it. I had the porter cable model which is quite a bit more expensive. I found it to be bulkier to use than the DeWalt and a lot more likely to slip away from your alignment marks than the DeWalt. This cutter has pins on both sides of the blade that go a long way to help keeping the cutter in line with the wood.. The only drawback is that the dust chute will clog with the dust bag installed when cutting into long grained softwoods.Having owned both the porter cable and the Dewalt I must give a big nod to the DeWALT. Smaller and easier to use and a few $$ less.
2,Very Disappointed,"Upon receiving this tool I immediately checked the plunge depth and found it was not even close when set to 0,10 and 20. I found that the adjusting screw which is supposed to be for fine depth adjustment was not set to the correct depth. Upon further examination I found that the screw was stripped and would not allow me to reset it. I had to remove the screw and tap it and reinstall it and set it for the 3 different size bisciuts. Not at all what I expect from a tool at this cost. Where is the quality control????"
5,nice unit,I bought this a few months ago and have built quite a few shelving units and a wine rack with it. It produces rock solid joints with very little effort. I found the fence to be very accurate with factory settings.
4,"Very nice, great price.","I bought this fanny pack as a Christmas gift for a friend of mine who is pretty small. He used to be a Horse Jockey and I was affraid to buy him a pack online, because I didnt know if they would be monsterous on his 5'2 frame. This pack is perfect. Not only is it small but the leather is really soft and the interior looks sturdy. I imagine he will store his phone, wallet, keys, and a pair of glasses in it. I didnt look at the waist band so it may be too big for him, but I'll just sew it smaller if needed, not a big deal for such a great price."
2,nice pack for large people,The fanny pack is great but the waist band is sized for very large people.
3,"good quality, poor design","This product is well made but poorly designed. The main pocket is to small to fit much stuff in it. The two side zippered pockets are so tiny the only thing you might use them for is a few coins in each one, what a waste. This would be a great waist bag if the main pocket were extended all the way and make the pocket extend outward a little more so as to hold more items and allow easier access."
4,Sturdy and useful,"I need a fanny pack for traveling (rather than emptying out all of my pockets when I go through the metal detector). This fills the bill; I would like more compartments, but the leather is nice and durable, and I especially like the pocket for my cell phone."
4,Hellboy Rocks!!!,"This is a great movie with plenty of action, and attention to detail. THe Blue-ray version is incredible, showcasing the sharpness of the movie shooting sets as well as the characters. Also, the extras are super, especially the tour of the movie sets. The collector's set is a fan must have!"
4,"Good Movie, Must see for Fans","This is not quite as good as the first movie, but any Hellboy fan needs to make the effort to see it."
4,Hellboy strikes again . . .,"Like any sequel , seeing the first give you an understanding of the characters .If you enjoyed the first Hellboy , you wont be dissapointed with the second .We're not talking academy award performances , but with this genre , who cares ?"
4,A good sequel,I enjoyed the 1st very much. This one is both a prequel and sequel because of flash backs to hellboy's childhood. It was an enjoyable story with all the great action and humor of the 1st.
3,Digital copy not valid,"Film is fine. Disappointed with purchase. Was supposed to come with downloadable digital copy, and when I tried to get it, I was alerted that it was no longer a valid offer."
5,great fun!,I watched this my husband and two of my grandchildren. it was action packed and thoroughly enjoyable! I would reccommend this even if you didn't see the first one.
5,Hellboy 2 is AWESOME!,I am a big fan of the comic and of the first movie. I must say that this movie rocked! It was excellent and I loved it from beginning to end. Johann Krauss was a hilarious addition to the BPRD!!!
1,It was not captioned or subtitled.,They don't have a feature where you can click on for subtitled so I ordered a movie that I couldn't watch. It was not cool.
5,Great Movie!,i really enjoy the hellboy movies. if you are a fan of hellboy then you should love his movie too! 5 Stars!
2,Not a fan of Hellboy.,"I have seen both movies, and I just can't seem to warm up to any of the characters in either one. They are either annoying or all out jerks, and the girl is really waffly. I was very impressed with the special effects, however, especially the winged harpy. But the story didn't grab my attention at all and special effects are not enough to carry a movie."
5,Great condition!,"This Blu-Ray came to me in excellent condition with only minor wear, and even then only on the sleeve (which my daughter promptly destroyed anyways...). It also arrived in a timely manner from the seller."
1,Terrible tone and awful characterizations.,"I like the first film, but somehow, between that and this film, the characters got annoying. Liz is whiny, Abe is a love-sick idiot who doesn't think clearly, and Hellboy cracks jokes that aren't funny.I have to complain most about Abe. I don't care about the voice; what bothers me is how he caves and gives the villain the thing he needs to awaken the Golden Army all because the villain threatens his own sister--Abe's newfound love. Okay, so Abe just met this chick, and anything the villain does to her happens to him as well, so he can't kill her. So...where's the conflict?Not sure if Del Toro caught that plothole or just didn't care. Either way, this movie is awful. I groaned more than laughed."
2,Not What I expected,"I ordered Hellboy II and it said it was in great condition, it was not. At the beginning it will hardly play, and that's if you can even get it to start. I will not be ordering from this company before."
2,No where near as good as Hellboy (I),The first movie was filled with a comedy but this one was kind of just action and no humor like the first.
3,Good but not a great movie,Hellboy II: The Golden Army was a good but not a great story to purchase in retrospect I would not have bought it had I known how poor it was. I watched it but was not that impressed by the movie itself.
5,DVD,The dvd hellboy that I bought was brand new. Very good working condition. My son liked it. Reviewed quite well in our house.
2,"Eh,","Bought this as a gift, I enjoyed hellboyI but Hellboy II was just not as good. Hoping for a 3rd good one tho."
3,"Bros, where art thou?","This second outing for the candy-eating, cat-loving, cigar-chewing demon has all of del Torro's trademark visual and storytelling flair. The effects and creatures are typically imaginative and spectacular. There are some nice touches of his characteristic humour. And there are many references to earlier works, particularly Chronos and Pan's Labyrinth. Yes, there's much to enjoy here, but it isn't quite as successful as the first film. It falls a little short with the story, which is somewhat predictable and a bit overblown. Generally, it lacks some of the lightness of touch with which del Torro crafted the original movie. I also had a problem with the Johann Kraus character who struck me as unconvincing and clunky (by contrast, Luke Goss as Prince Nuada was something of a revelation). Overall this is an entertaining movie though it doesn't quite match del Torro's best. 3.5 out of 5 would be a fair rating."
3,The First One was better,"Although we enjoyed the movie, it just wasn't as engaging as the first one. They were sillier in this one, which is fun, but you weren't drawn in as much - sometimes things can be a little too light hearted. I probably would've been happy just to have rented the video rather than add it to my collection or at least just got it as a regular dvd rather than blu ray."
2,Hellboy II - war is heck,I purchased Hellboy II after reading a number of the reviews at Amazon. The first flick was enjoyable and I thought the second would be better. Turns out I was wrong. The special effects were generally good and the action sequences fair to good with the fight scene between the dark elf and HB at the end the most enjoyable. The exception is the an early scene in which HB and crew try to fight off thousands of tiny fairies with single shot pistols - the only victims of the fairy mass attacks were the non-essential characters which makes the fight seem contrived HOWEVER the main problem with HBII is the dialogue which is simple and insipid and utterly lacking in imagination - the humor aims for the lowest common denominator and at times lapses into slapstick - poorly done slapstick at that. My advice - do not buy this movie before you screen it.Glenn
3,No Empire Strikes Back,"I was expecting alot out of Hellboy II. The first movie had such a great story line and great characters. This movie seemed like cliche humor with no attempt to even care about production or even acting. Like everyone was in front of the camera at gun point. If there is a third installment, it might as well be played by Nick Nolte and Margaret Cho. They can play either lead; doesnt matter."
3,Hellboy II,"The movie transcended two realms, and possibly three and that of the earth and those who were aligned with humans were then pitted against those of the earth but not linked to the dimension inwhich humans reside and there was no ability for their plight to be realized except through that of inilliation, it would be good if the writers, and then ultimately the directors, would portray a well rounded voice of the conflicts that exist but do not result in the abolishing of connectivity. Truth comes from everywhere and their were fragments and then fiction, which is sad."
4,A beautiful vision of the graphic novel,"Hellboy 2 has a new story unrelated to the first film. Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) was also a lot more involved in the art direction and wow, it shows. The visuals were simply beautiful. Some might like the plot of Hellboy 1 a little better, but after watching it again, I would say they're about equal to me. This installment is definitely more fantastic and I like that.I really liked the movie even from the opening history vignette that is acted out by animated wooden figures. The whole production oozes style. It has the humor of the first movie and enough eye candy that it would be worth a watch even if the plot sucked, which it didn't."
5,Warning! Hellboy 2 disk comes with curse! Someone Call the B.P.R.D.!,"Be warned! Strange things have started happening in the Tarpalsfan household ever since viewing the movie; Hellboy: The Golden Army. Mom's have started buying comics and daughters have started talking about blue fish guys! Things have only gotten worse since the purchase of the dvd version of Hellboy: The Golden Army! Terrible things such as disk abuse-as in I can't stop watching this movie. Favorite heros return such Hellboy(duh) Liz Sherman, Abe Sapien, Dr, Tom Manning and new to the Hellboy movies, one of my favorites: Johann Krauss! Ectoplasmic man-from B.P.R.D. comic fame! All we need now is Kate and Roger! There are elves-trolls and more. And best of all a super hero adventure that isn't so dark that you can't enjoy it. The end was a little sad for me-sniff-poor..nevermind..don't mention his name out loud-because if my daughter tells me how cute the blue guy is once more-I'm gonna toss my movie out a window and follow it out!"
4,A feast for eyes and imagination,"I bought this movie for Del Toro's sumptuous imagery and imagination. I was not disappointed. It is certainly a feast, and deserving of great acclaim. The story, however, is uneven at times and could benefit from a tighter, clearer vision similar to, for instance, Pan's Labyrinth."
3,Disappointing...,"I'm a HUGE fan of Hellboy, and though there are lots of special effects, I sadly found the dialogue in HBII third rate. Where did all the great one-liners go? Red is reduced to a whiny, p-whipped, crybaby in this over-produced sequel.Remember in HBI: ""Gonna be sore in the mornin'"", ""First date, no tongue.."", ""But, I didn't get you anything"", ""How big could it be?""...And in HBII, since Father is dead, and Agent John Meyers was not signed on for the movie, the beauty of their interactions and balance is gone.Tom Manning now is bounced back and forth; I like Hellboy and we are friends, to, I despise Hellboy but am scared of him. Totally unconvincing!And a new character is introduced; Johann Krauss. The most obnoxious character since Jar Jar Binks!"
2,Too flashy - not enough substance,The first movie was very much more betterer. Too much flash and not enough substance in this one.
2,Hellboy+Evil Elf+Bad Slapstick=Mediocre Film,"I've been a a fan of the comic Hellboy for a long time and I enjoyed the first movie so I was set to really dig this one. I thought that Del Toro could do no wrong after HB 1 and Pandora's Box. How wrong I was. What we got was a ""Evil"" elf straight of of Lord of the Rings who was about as evil as and altar boy next to Rasputin in the first movie which manager to balance the darkness of H.P. Lovecraft with the levity of the comics (but not too much like HBII)Overall, HBII was a mess and was matinee kiddy-fare with hardly a chill in sight except for the tooth fairy's who were still too bloody cute to be scary. Add to all this mess the comedy routine between Abe and HB and it was mostly a loss. I was bitterly disapointed after walking out of the theater."
1,Most disapointing sequel since Highlander II,"What a HUGE diappointment. Del Toro took the characters that we fell in love with, in the original Hellboy, and made them each drink a pot of coffee and take a bottle of No-Doze thinking it was going to give us more of what we wanted. So wrong. There were certain scenes that looked like ripoffs from ""Lord Of The Rings"", ""Never Ending Story"" and even a Star Wars Mos Eisley Cantina bar scene thrown in for good measure. One cheesey scene after another. I haven't been this disappointed in a sequel since Highlander II when Russell Mulcahy turned our lovable earth bound immortals into whacko aliens from planet Zorg. Don't waste your money on this one, wait for it on TV - then watch something else."
1,It's already been said...,"Ok, first off I have to address the voice of Abe Sapien. I realize the whole story behind David Hyde Pierce refusing credit in the first movie because he felt the performance of Doug Jones was brilliant. Agreed. Doug Jones does a brilliant job wherever he appears. However he just doesn't carry Abe Sapiens character the way Hyde Pierce did. I too LOVED the first movie. Can't count the number of times I have seen it. But there was no threat to the world. I never feard for humanity. I never feared for Hellboy. And the overblown accent of Dr. Strauss was a movie killer. Even Sargent Schultz and Kernel Klink has better and more digestable accents. Beautiful imagery. TERRIBLE story telling."
2,Hellboy II: the golden army,"OK so who was that guy playing the evil prince??? He totally stole the show with his sword-play. Could'nt wait for him to return. Cute twist with Selma Blair; but talk about chaste. She did'nt even KISS Hellboy! A much better movie if they combined I & II. An evil FLOWER??? Come on, guys. And the Golden Army looked like yellow bowling balls; take a lesson from ""Lara Croft"" or the ""Mummy"" movies for creepy ancient return from the dead monsters. Wait for a night when you are totally bored to rent this one."
2,This is NOT Widescreen!,The Amazon description of the 3 disc special addition states that it is the wide screen version. NOthing could be further from the truth. To my great disappointment it is only the FULLSCREEN version.Boooo!
1,In Hell with Romantic Hellboy,What a let down for Hellboy I fans...This movie totally sucked...Hollywood amazingly turned goth camp into surfer bubblegum for a terminally boring ride.
1,Garbage,"This was horrible. They took Hellboy and made him a sissy. Everyone has a right to an opinion and that's cool, I just disagree with this one being any good. I ended walking out of the movie theater when it came out. I just tried to sit down and watch it again because it was on TV and after suffering through the whole thing. I know I was right to have left. Sure Pan's Labrynth was good but that does not mean that you have to like everything del Toro does. All they did was visual while the story itself either sucked or sucked the persona of Hellboy. Really, Freaking singing and sobbing over relationships? WTH? Why would they even include that scene? Trying to Humanize him for what? It's an action fantasy not a campaign for congressman. But it's ok, for most ppl this will be great since it's made for the masses. If you liked Idiocracy you will love this."
4,a bit of fun escapist entertainment,"This second installment in the Hell Boy series is a funny and engaging bit of escapist entertainment. The visual effects are impressive and engaging. The story line is simple and direct.In troubled times, it is not a bad idea to let your mind go on a brief fantasy vacation with s piece of fluff like this. What musicals did for the Depression Era audience, such movies now do for us."
5,great movie,There has been talk about a third Hellboy movie or possibly a live-action series. I hope so.
3,I liked the first one better,Hellboy II was too much like the Lord of the Rings. Some of the special effects were great but that's about it. I liked the first one the best and was excited to watch Hellboy II but was disappointed.
4,Hellboy's back,I liked this movie much as people said they fell alsleep through it. As always HellBoy's humor pretty much stands out in this one as well as Abe and him singing while their drunk. Over all I give it four because the first one is still the best.
5,Outstanding!,I was utterly blown away by this!If you love fantasy / sci-fi movies ... just get it!!!
5,Hellboy Rocks,"Both of the Hellboy movies are awesome! The script is great, the effects are great, the characters are great... We love the sarcastic humor and Hellboy's kitties. :) I don't understand why Hellboy isn't as mainstream as Spiderman and X-Men, etc."
3,Predictable,"The visuals in this film are fantastic, but I'd expect no less from Guillermo del Toro. The problem is that the plot is almost hopelessly predictable."
4,Liked it alot...but it's missing something.,"this is your typical fantasy type movie. i liked it cause who doesn't love hellboy..but it was short. much like the first one you miss the creature battles and expect to see a bit more of their world. you gotta love his humor which is not nearly played up enough. he was so cute as a kid. you want to see more of him growing up! *SPOILER* since he learns liz is preggy, i'd love to see his babies in another one! that would be awesome. definitely worth at least one watch to form your own opinion. but i swear if things don't work out with my hubby, Hellboy can sure call me!"
3,Cheap packaging.,"This is a review of the product rather than the movie itself. I received my giftset with much anticipation, especially after having purchased the first Hellboy collectors gift set when it came out. My heart sank when I laid hands on this one. The box is tiny, much smaller than the picture above makes it look, and made of cardstock slightly thicker than photocopier paper. There were more dents and creases in the box than a demolition derby racer. The figure is nicely constructed but very small. There really is nothing to recommend this giftset over the standard release. Very, very dissapointing. Up your game Universal."
5,Wish I bought it sooner,"Saw this DVD on Amazon for around $18 when it first came out and put it in my whis list. I should have bought it sooner because it went up to $26.Still a great buy, it has a digital copy and special effects disc that will keep any fan of HELL BOY entertained."
5,very good,I'm in iraq and it always takes a few days but it came in round 8-10 days which is still pretty good. Cause most stuff takes two weeks but 8 days is pretty much the best yall get.
2,Hellboy II The Golden Army,"For some odd reason I prefer the first movie to the sequel,I like Hellboy's character but I think it could been better,for some reason I thought I was watching harry potter mixed with labyrinth."
2,Didn't meet my expectations,"I wanted to like it, but the disappointing storyline was too big an obstacle. Perlman's wisecracks and gritty attitude were funny, but Del Toro's normally inspired storytelling couldn't carry this comic book sequel. Hard to follow the plot, with the thousands of bizarre Star Wars creatures. I'd recommend the first one instead.http://www.amazon.com/Hellboy-William-Hoyland/dp/B001AK3S4Y/"
2,Could have been great,"So much CG talent and so much earnestness from Del Toro, so much visual splendor, and it's all to serve a story and screenplay that's plucked right from the head of a suburban ten year-old who plays Xbox all day. Studio movies tend to aim downward, but this one aims WAY down to the level of Shrek 2, or Nickelodeon. How this can be the same guy who gave us Pan's Labyrinth, I'll never know. Repeat, some great CG, but DUMB in the worst way possible. And by the way Del Toro, you've totally dated this movie by having everyone fight with that retread kung fu wire-fight style. So, Hellboy is a Chinese acrobat in his spare time? Man, I feel like I've insulted 10 year-olds in this review, now that I think about it."
2,Not funny,"Disappointing. The humor essential to Hellboy's survival in a world that treats him like a freak is totally missing. Without this and his love for family he would totally crack up and destroy the humans around him. The love affair has been cheapened by marriage that makes the love a ""given"" rather than a genuine feeling that takes place against all odds. What's left is just another film about monster chasing. Yawn. Worse yet, this film seems confused about its audience. The scene with Hellboy fighting a monster while holding the baby is just a rehash of Hellboy I scene of fighting a monster while holding the kittens. While the kitten scene was believable, the baby scene is not - wouldn't he just put the baby down somewhere? What audience does this kind of scene appeal to? If you're going to write a film about monster-chasing, at least come up with some original material. And preferably make it somewhat believable."
3,"Better than the first, but still sub-par","I wasn't crazy aboutHellboy. This sequelHellboy II: The Golden Army [Blu-ray]is a bit better, but still suffers from similar problems. The special effects - trolls, elves, etc - just didn't look that realistic to me. The plot was again pretty silly, but at least the villains were better. If you likedHellboy, you'll probably likeHellboy II: The Golden Army [Blu-ray] better. If you didn't like the first one, this one's probably not worth your time."
1,Can't seem to figure out what the films audience is,This was probably one of the worst flicks I've seen this year... still can't figure out what the target audience was supposed to be.But apart from that no real extra stuff on this bd version(So you get bored of the extra's aswell)
1,Hell(is watching this movie)Boy 2,"Loved Hellboy, the original. HB2 is a an over-blown hodgepodge of Matrix, Men In Black, LOTR, etc. Unoriginal script that tries to force the humor and left me saying, ""Who cares??"". My son got up and went to bed 10 minutes befofe the end of the film! Yipes."
2,"Big, loud, boring, and really, really stupid!",Pan's Lab made into this crap - one trick pony done to death - what absolute crap - enough said!
1,Would not Play,"I have a new Sony Blue Ray Player,Also, a 40 inch Sony, HD T.V.This Blu-ray Disc did not play, and when I saw how much it cost to send back. I just filed it."
1,Simply Stupid,"Well, my husband wanted to rent it, but I told him I never saw the first one, he said, no problem, you don't need to, well, this has got to be one of the dumbest movies ever made, it rates right up there with that Arnold S. movie about being the last super hero, which I turned off after 15 minutes, I sat through this one groaning all the while. Needless to say I have no interest in seeing the first ""Hellboy""... Selma Blair's character in ""Hellboy"" certainly mimics her role in ""Kath & Kim"", dreadful!"
1,Warning - won't play in sony BDP-300,The movie crashes when you try to play it on a Sony BDP-300. Latest frimware not working.
3,Hansel & Gretel 1954 - only redo it rightl,"This somewhat abridged version of the Opera offers a jewel of a translation by celebrated poet Padraic Colum, a far cry more poetic and evocative than the German original. The puppets, a Czech develoment, got moved and reset 140,000 times between clicks of director Meyerberger's shutter. The effect's intriguing, the music's classic, the orchesta's first rate, the singing's skilled. I've seen and heard the orginal. It bids fair to be a legacy and any child's happiest introduction to opera. But . . . . It's not. This DVD didn't come from from a master, not even a first generation print. More likely a third or fourth level copy of a copy. The video suffers some but the sound stands just this side of obliteration. You can even hear the needle chatter of a vinyk record. It's too good a classic to lose this way. Go back and do it right."
2,Charming film; awful transfer,"Aside from some silent classics, if ever a film needed a complete restoration, it's this one. Sadly, it doesn't appear it will ever happen. If you remember it's haunting score and gingerbread children from seeing it at a Saturday matinee long ago, you may be better off with your memories. It actually appears as though someone with a shaky hand recorded this off of a very worn print."
5,Hansel and Gretel: An Opera Fantasy,"Takes you back to the early 60's watching this on WPIX Channel 11 as a TV special. It is nice to have for your collection, younger children may not enjoy it today."
3,QUALITY CAN BE MUCH BETTER!,Please...someone out there remaster this classic masterpiece from the original elements which supposedly still exist in the Meyerberg estate. An improved version will command a much better price and it would sell well internationally!Everyone agrees that this is an incredibly charming version of the fairytale and that Humperdink's music along with the fine operatic performances deserves a better treatment!Somebody please step forward and revive this beautiful film!
1,Very Poor Picture Quality,"Very horrible picture quality. Very grainy & audio drags, which is a drag since I was particularly looking forward to hearing the songs from my childhood. Definitely a waste of money & time on my part, please save your money & time!"
5,A Book for the Thinking Horseman,"""Balance in Movement"" is an excellent book for the thinking horseman who wishes to improve his/her communication skills with their horse. The book details how, physically, we ride and how our body, unconsciously or unconsciously, effects the way our horses react. This is not an easy read, the anatomical terms can get a bit unwieldy, but the excellent photos and line drawings illustrate each point clearly, and make rereading sections valuable. This book can be compared favorably with ""An Anatomy of Riding"" by H. Schusdziarra, MD and V. Schusdziarra, MD., although ""Balance in Movement""does not have a specific Dressage focus. I can recommend this book to anyone who has wondered just exactly how to achieve the perfect balance on a moving horse."
3,I wish...,"I needed an 8 1/4"" saw. I shopped the site, checked reviews and price. My gut told me that I should buy the Mikita because I really like their saws. But, have always had good luck with Dewalt tools, so I decided to save 40 bucks and buy the Dewalt. Wish I had of listened to my gut feeling. The Dewalt is heavy duty and has great power. But, I am cutting through 2 1/2"" of foam with poly straps in it (ICF forms). The Dewalt is heavy to use cutting horizontally on a wall. You can't grip it very well so as to hold back the blade guard when doing a plung cut. It just isn't ergonomically correct. I will probably love it when cutting timbers on my next job though. It is meant to be a beefy wood hog, not a cut out opening in ICF walls saw. Reminds me of a Black and Decker I used framing many years ago."
2,DW384,"I used this babe for over two years, and have been the best saw than I own. Very well build tool have also the safety feature of an electric brake than stop it in less than two seconds when you release the switch. Very easy to adjust the zero point (kerf indicator) and parallelism between the blade and the shoe. Surprising for me was the oustanding balance and plenty of power for the hardest of the tropical woods (Use carbide tiped blade...please) Also have a cord keeper for place the cable away in some chores. The only drawback than I see, is no metric conversion kits available for the people like me than not use inches!"
4,Lots of fun,"I bought this CD after seeing the video for ""Southside Stomp"". Jenai is truly a refreshing new sound.Most of the songs are upbeat (I subtracted a star because the CD could use a couple more changes of pace). The standouts are ""Southside Stomp"", the Texas-swinger ""Papa Don't Ask, Mama Don't Know"" and the mellow, blues-y ""It Won't be Me"". ""Loraine"" is about that 'fast' girl everyone knows and is a toe-tapping song with a great drumbeat. I listen to this CD a lot at work, it makes the time go by quickly and is just a lot of fun."
1,JG is a lil weasle that has had luck in his race car,he is over rated and after one good crash like Rusty Wallace has had he will not be as a good of driver as he is now. that is my opinion and i know opinions are like a--holes everyone has one but just watch and see. And i am not saying that i want to see him crash to get hurt but just watch and see! Dale Jarett all the way!!!!!
1,This is the worst book about Gordon written!,"I am a huge Jeff Gordon fan and I have read and enjoyed almost anything written about him, but I have nothing good to say about this book. It is poorly written and reads very slowly. The facts in it are already well known and are repeated over and over again. I have gotten more info about Gordon in a two paragraph newspaper artical then this contains. After reading it, I felt like I wasted time and money. In general, I would say, don't waste anything on this book, it's not worth it. I also feel George Mair needs to go back to school or get a new editor. A bad book for many reasons."
3,"Interesting, but nothing to write home about","I read this book hoping to get insight into Gordon's past, which I did get, somewhat. I've read articles that were more informative, but I did enjoy reading the book, mostly because I am a fan, so anything is something. This would have been a great book, had there been more substance and less repeated information. After reading it, I was glad I did because of the few things I did learn, but I probably won't read it again. From an editor's point of view, the mistakes in this book were constant and annoying. I'm a senior in high school, and the editor of our school newspaper, and I would be ashamed if these kind and quantity of mistakes were present in our paper."
1,Terrible!,"This book was badly written for a couple of reasons. First of all, there are a lot of grammar mistakes, making it seem like it was just thrown together. Secondly, most of the information it contained is already very well known and some of it false. It contadicts itself in several places. There are quite a few good books out there about Gordon, but this is definatly not one of them."
1,This trimmer suffers from several critical defects,"This trimmer suffers from several critical defects:The depth adjustment is difficult to use and worse loosens often during use unless you tighten the lock knob with a tool instead of your handsThe base doesn't sit at a reliable ninety degrees so one side of the router trims to a different depth than the otherThe collet has an on-board lock that grabs the motor leaving you with no leverage to loosen it, i.e. you have just one wrench and holding the motor with one hand while turning the wrench with the other after a 30,000 rpm motor has tightend the collet isn't fun.Not ready for prime time."
1,Poor workmanship,"This router is poorly built. I send back the one I received for replacement and the new one had the same problems. On both routers the base was not square with router and they had high vibration. I also found the routers to be heavy, large and awkward to use. These routers deserve 0 out of 5 stars."
1,"Poor, Poor, Poor design",This tool is difficult to change a bit on due to the motor lock and single wrench operation. It is on the heavy side as well. The base is difficult to adjust and does not sit square with the bit.I would not recommend to a friend or an enemy...
5,Great album,"The four CD boxset of this is coming out soon (Fall 2011), but I thought I would add a quick note that the version of ""Hey Joe"" on this album is simply amazing. It opens with a fanfare before settling into the regular song. It is well recorded, and may even be my favorite Hendrix recording, has to be heard to be believed."
5,Church of the Holy Sepulcre,The book is essential for understanding the lengthy and complex history of such an important monument!
5,Great Video,"I do this on my needak rebounder which increases the cardio output as my legs are always bouncing, but not because it needed it as it is challenging on its own. I also love the no impact the rebounder provides . It is a really fun video. The combinations are tough and challenging so you won't get bored. She also keeps things moving so there are no dull spaces. Practice will make perfect and because I really enjoyed it, I will do it often.I'll save her longer workouts for the weekend."
4,American Painted Porcelain by Dorothy Kamm,"China painting was a popular pastime in the Victorian era. This book is very useful in identifying items from the period 1877-1917. Some pieces are unmarked and some are marked with various manufacturers but were sold as ""blanks"" and decorated. Descriptions of how the items were used at the turn of the century, outlines of how the items were produced, and examination of the styles of painting are considered in evaluation and in valuation. Values in average retail range were given for approximately 400 pieces. Artists and studios are listed so that you can find out more about your signed pieces. I wish more information was available on the decals used."
2,Just showing really fast how he does it!,I am a little dissapointed in this DVD. Larry shows really fast how he does it and some parts are only a series of photos. Lots of references to a book he wrote and which I don't have. Very little explanation. Not usefull and not recommended!
3,great for begenners,"I thought that Larry vedio was great , but I would have appricated if he had gone into more depth on hip roof framing and doormers also on badard hip also if he would demonstrated technique on walking walls I did like his proficient very much,and hopes that he does a vedio for more advance carpenters or builders."
5,Dr. Quinn season 3,"I loved the series when it was on, but season 3 is my particular favorite. The characters are more developed, and the storylines are terrific. There are so mnay great episodes during this season. ""What is Love?"" and ""For Better or Worse"" (the beautiful wedding) are two of my personal favorites. The commentary with Jane Seymour and Joe Lando during ""For Better or Worse"" is wonderful. It's interesting to get their view of what happened to make that episode. I definately recommend this season on DVD and any other Dr Quinn season!! It was a wonderful show."
3,Not worth the money,There's no B-side and the live songs are poorly mixed. I'd buy the album and skip the single. It's not worth it.
2,The problem with this seat is the price,"This would be a good seat for 30-50 dollars cheaper. The problem is that's it's overpriced. I would like to see Dorel price this seat around $80, at which point I believe they would actually start selling these again. You can buy a Graco Nautilus for the LESS than this costs on Amazon currently. It will last most children longer and is a much nicer seat. No need for headrests, and it is made by a company that has a history of much more ethical practices than Dorel.The only situation I could imagine this being a good choice is if a child was obese, their parents could not afford a Britax Regent, and the car had headrests or high seat backs. I would only do so in that situation because it would be highly possible that the child would not fit into a Nautilus. Otherwise it's a waste of money."
3,"Love the seat, hate the belt....","Really, it is a great seat.....in fact I have two. Then why only three stars? Because the center (crotch) belt does not adjust (very short) and the buckle mechanism is a large unusual shape. These require my 4 year old to sit in an awkward position so not to dig into her thighs. However, I've seen other posts say that the manufacture will soon send owners a retro-fit kit that should resolve this issue. If so, then absolutely 5 stars."
4,It get's the job done.,"I purchsed this car seat because of the extra weight capacity in the five pont harness. My two (now almost three) year old weighs in at 37 pounds and, even though he met the weight requirements, he could no longer fit in the five point harnesses that are rated to 40 lbs. I've had the seat for almost a year.Pros:The seat is large and accomdates my son and his toys easily.Def. the five point harness weight limit.It's an attractive seat.The latch system is easy to use.PRICE! It's less than half the cost of the only other extra weight capacity five point seat out there.Cons:The arm pads come off .. and they are fun for baby to take off. Mine are gone.The cup holder is flimsy and mine broke within the first couple of months.Not much padding.Seat belt twists up and is a pain to use.Bottom line .. it's not perfect .. but if you want to keep your child in the five point harness for as long as you can .. it's a great way to go. You can't beat the price.Cons:"
4,Great for the price,"We had originally intended to buy the Britax Regent, but got tired of waiting for stock. We wanted a seat that enabled us to continue to use a 5-point harness with our 3 1/2 year old as he grew out of his regular car seat. The Safety 1st seat suits our needs very well. It does not have quite the quality and feel of the Britax. The fabric feels a little cheap and the belts and buckles are very basic. But this seat is 1/2 the price of the Britax and there is no reason to believe that is is not equally as safe for our child. It remains to be seen if it is as durable over time (our 3 year old Marathon seat has been a workhorse and now is used by our 9 month old)."
3,Not too bad,"We liked this carseat because it had a higher weight limit for the internal harness, which was necessary for our 35 pound wiggly 3 year old. However, the seat seems to be very difficult to tighten on our child. We were used to a more user-friendly restraint system and have still not gotten used to the way the harness tightens."
3,"buy the hardcopy, not the kindle version","Displayed code examples are barely legible in the kindle version of this book. They appear as low resolution images and cannot be enlarged. Other kindle books format programming code fragments as text which is resizable, but not this book."
5,A Great Read.....,"Blarney Stone ....Thank you for ""Saving The Best Wine"" till last!! Most books for me burn out after about 10 pages. But not yours!! It instantly peaked my interest and held my attention till the very ""final word."" Thank you! Can't wait till the next book.This author has such an exquisite Biblical background, the gift of God-given insights, a superb mastery of alternative wisdom, rich pithy expressionism plus a delightful warm, sharp sense of humor!A great read. Another plus for Clinton, Massachusett - truly labeled--""Best Extradordinary Town By A Dam Site."" R.L.Harding,publishusa@yahoo.com"

WoldFinder by Nancy SpringerTurnings by Diana L. PaxsonThe Long Hunt by Len Wein and William RotslerFive-Finger Exercise by Esther M. Friesner
4,An interesting addition to the BoTC Line.,"The triumphant prose anthology series ""Blood of Ten Chiefs"" continues with this anthology, and it appears that it just keeps getting better.The duds are few and far between in this book of tightly-written short stories set in the past of the world of ElfQuest - created by Wendy and Richard Pini. This is a series that has satisfied me as a reader more times than even Robert Asprin's Thieve's World series. The startling array of talents in this volume must be seen to be believed.So why isn't this book a perfect 10? Because one of the stories is ""To Be Continued,"" and there still isn't a volume 6. That's why."
3,"Great concept, yet has problems","I give this book 3 stars because the author has definite creative potential, the ending was a surprise, and a very good one; but I don't like all the sentence fragments and I think he just added some things to show his creativity, things which are not relevant to the story at hand. It was a slow read for me, someone who reads on average 2 books a week. There was a time when I put it down for a week without picking it up, and I almost didn't finish it, but I had to know who the killer was. Like I said, the ending was a great surprise, and if I liked his style, this would have definitely been a 5 star book."
4,THE WHEAT FIELD,"THE BOOK ""THE WHEAT FIELD"" BY STEVE THAYER WAS AN INTERESTING BOOK THAT REALLY APEALED TO ME. THE REASON IT DID IS BECAUSE IT WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN. ALTHOUGHT WHAT I REALLY LIKED WAS HOW THE AUTHOR KEPT THE BOOK GOING IN A FAST PACED MOOD WHICH KEPT ME INTERESTED."
2,Too Convoluted & Implausible,"By the time I had read about half this book, I could've given it 4 stars, in fact I was hoping for a crackerjack ending that would raise it to 5. I liked the reminiscing style of Thayer's writing plus not too much useless details. Then the book completely unraveled with too many unconvincing convolutions, an unbelievable plot twist bordering on ludicrous & of course evil, conspiratorial Republicans! And Pennington's voyeurism totally turned me off, watching teenagers...Ugh!"
5,Excellent read!,"This is a fascinating mystery placed in the early 60's and told in retrospect. The main character is deputy Pliny Pennington, a brooding singular individual who is both enthralling and scary. It is the story of a high school crush that becomes an obsession, possibly because the deputy is unable to consummate his loves as a result of an injury incurred in the Korean War.Maggie Butler and her husband, Michael, are found dead in a wheat field. Is it murder-suicide? Or is it a double murder? How are these deaths related to the hidden power structure within the county? Slowly the deputy unfolds the intricate interweaving of the answers to all these questions. The story is also a commentary on the hidden power structure in the United States and who belongs to the 'in' group, who chooses to NOT belong to the 'in' group, and who never would even be asked to join the power structure.The unfolding of the tale is gripping. Worth your time and money!"
3,I figured out the ending early on,"I normally enjoy Thayer's rather moody prose and unusual style of telling a story but this book was not an absorbing read for me. There were some interesting characters and situations but from the discovery of the two bodies I thought that Thayer telegraphed the denouement. When someone's face is blown away there is always the possiblity that the reader is being set up for a case of mistaken identity as happens in this book. That said, Thayer does a creditable job of ""peeling the onion's layers"" back from each of his main characters and their interesting, skewed lives and motivations. I agree with an earlier reviewer that Pickard's ""Virgin of Small Plains"" was a more effective mystery of a somewhat similar type but I still think Thayer excels at characterization and a superb sense of location."
2,I thought this book was very overrated.,"The copy I have lists excerpts from apparently rave reviews. I was not that impressed. The book isn't terrible-the main character is rather interesting and the pacing isn't too bad but there were several flaws that kept me from really enjoying the book.The subplot featuring the presidential campaign was not convincing at all.Aside from Pennington, the characters were not very well-developed in my opinion.I think writers like Thomas H. Cook handle this type of material (sex and violence lurking in small towns, the downfall of high school heroes and protagonists with a troubled past) much better.I recently read Nancy Pickard's book about a beautiful dark-haired young woman with a complicated sexual history who is loved unrequitedly by a local law enforcement officer and is found naked and dead in a field (The Virgin of Small Plains) and I liked it a lot better."
5,"Great piece of equipment, hands free(from tool) sanding","For the price of this stand it is one of the most helpful inexpensive ways to get a stand alone sanding unit. Now I'll amdit to being a big DeWalt fan, even so I must still comment on the ability to make easy and precise adjustments. This unit is easier to set up and put away than any bench top units available, so if bench space is a concern this is for you(and me). Love it"
5,Powerful,This is the most powerful western I have ever read. Absolutely gripping. Leaves you drained.Glenn Howard
1,2000 miles later... it's damage?,"Installed 4-5 months ago, the blade already detached at the far hand and I hardly drive my car. Out of all the blades I bought in my 20+ years of driving, I've never seen a blade that doesn't last at least a year and back then I was on the road everyday doing 20+K miles / year. I doubt I did more than 2K miles with this wiper.I'm glad I bought via amazon, I was able to track my order and the new pair of blade that I order won't be ANCO."
3,Interesante !,"Octavio Paz, describe a Mexico, al Mexicano y al Latinoamericano desde su realacion con la soledad y por ello con el resto de sus semejantes. Un libro que vale la pena leer, aunque no siempre se este de acuerdo con el planteamiento del autor. El tema invita a la reflexion sobre lo que somos y como influimos en el destino de nuestras naciones."
2,Where did the Great Scenes go?,"This video is really disappointing to me. I know a lot about Mozart, and Die Zauberflote in general. IF someone HAD to make an abridged version of Die Zauberflote (don't ask me why!) they could have done a better job than this. Most of the great scenes are cut out, and the story is changed a bit! Cutting out two thirds of the opening scene (""Zu Hilfe! Zu Hilfe!"") is a terrible idea, cutting out half of, ""Der Holle Rache"" is even WORSE, destroying the part where the Queen, Monastatos, and the Three Ladies are destroyed just as bad- Note: Cutting out the finale causes something like this to happen: ""The Queen told Pamina to kill Sarastro. Sarastro says, 'That's okay,' Papageno finds a mate, and they live happily ever after."" What happened to the Queen? Ugh! Also, the sound quality is terrible. The costumes are ugly, and the staging, with staircases leading nowherte on either side of the stage, just doesen't work. Put it all together and it spells disaster."
2,Don't waste your money,"I was terribly disappointed with this DVD. The singing and staging is barely adequate, the picture, sound quality, and sound direction are all second rate. Some of the arias were cut off prematurely and the transitions into the next scene were poorly done. If your intention is to introduce young people to the story, buy one of the highly recommended DVD's and do your own commentary."
2,Not really for kids,"This product advertises that it is for children, but the commentator talks through most of the excerpts, and my children (3 different classes) found it boring."
2,Language for kids?,This was sold as a recommendation for children. It was performed in German(?). While it did have a English narrator a child couldn't follow it.
3,better stuff out there,"i got this album about a year or so ago because i heard they were pretty good, and read a few reviews that said these guys were good. Well i was a bit dissapointed when i first listened to it, and still am. Although they aren't terrible or anything, it just all seems kinda bland. Gave it 3 stars because the music isn't all that bad, but the vocals kinda blow in my opinion, sounds like he's trying to hard. And dont think its because i like clean vocals, i generally don't, i listen to stuff thats alot more harsh/undicipherable then this that sounds better. My advice is listen before you buy, and if you like it, enjoy, if not remember there is alot of stuff out there better than LOG"
1,"sure, this is metal, if you used to like slipknot","this is garbage. ear candy for the mall kids to suck off for another year or so until they start selling their songs to pepsi. christ, metal is just turning into one big ball of crap.lamb of god suckchimaira suckblack dahlia murder suckarsis suck"
1,Horrible.,"Actually, I'm not under 13, I am an 18 year old metal head without an account, Lamb of God is a horrible screamo metal band that sucked on all thier cd's, They try to yell but just sound like idiot's, and this cd is the worst of the 3 horrible mallXcore cd's this overrater sellout band has made, I disklike Lamb of God, they definetly should have stayed Burn the Priest, at least they had a few good songs back then, If you want some good screamo or metal, try Atreyu, Jack *** Jill, Shadows Fall, Circle Takes the Square, Hatebreed, As I Lay Dying, a dozen furies, The Duskfall, The Unseen, Hawthorne Heights, HORSE the band, or Nile or somthing, and leave this horrible band to be forgotten!!"
1,no good,"i never could get into this band, i wouldnt exactly call them a true metal band, they are a bunch of overrated jerks and there is nothing special or original about there music."
1,Is this a Joke?,"After their first album I thought they were off to a great start, but after that album they have went straight down. This album is a horrible waste of money. LOG sucks! Listen to Arsis if you want to hear some real metal."
5,Lamb of God ROCKS!,"I love Lamb of God they are proablaly my fav band rite now. This cd is what got me into LoG and, after listening to ther other to cds, New American Gospel and As the Palaces Burn, is LoG's best. Dont get me wrong, the other cds rock to, but this one just kicks so much ass! The first song, Laid to Rest is the best song on the album along with Hourglass and Omerta. Buy this CD!"
4,Pretty good,"I struggled with wether to give this 3.5 or 4 stars. I was a little disappointed with AotW when I first got it but, after four times through, it's growing on me.Very heavy, no argument there, and there are some pretty good songs. None of the songs really blew me away, though. There are moments with very cool riffs and grooves (not any soloing worth speaking off) but even when a song starts out solid, they sometimes peter-out towards the middle. I can't help but compare them with (early) Pantera in my own mind and I find Lamb of God lacking in some way I can't quite articulate...Still, AotW is a pretty good disc. It's nothing you need to run out and buy right away but it's worth listening to if you have a chance to pick up a copy.Recommended."
4,Their best but not THE best,"I have to admit, after hearing who was going to produce this album ithought it was gonna suck (...) (machine...). Turns out to be very well done. The production quality is top notch, well above NAG and ATPB. The guitar work and vocals are actually exceptionally better than on the others. He does a bit of talking on it, which is kind of boring because he has the kind of computer nerd voice, but cool none-the-less. At least he doesnt try to sing at all. Defintely a must buy.Best Track: Remorse is for the Dead"
4,"Other than the singing, this CD is excellent",These guys are so good that I have learned to ignore the singer with his deep growling which is the only reason I gave them 4 stars. Other than that everything sounds tight. I specialy enjoy the drumming. This guy uses the bass drums a lot but he is always in control. Unbelievable!
4,i am pleasantly surprised,"i knew lamb of god was one of the more well known hardcore bands on this year's ozzfest, so i figured i would like them as well.starting off is one of my favorite songs right now, ""laid to rest"".grr i love that song.i cant say enough.just wants me to get up and crush something.this album is very well produced, extremely well recorded.each isntrument is picked up perfectly.the double bass work is phenomenal and the power metal guitar sound is all the rampant.randy's vocals are definitely a highlight.his growls are done in such a way that they dont grate at you, they are actually quite smooth.i am enjoying this album immenseley and it will only continue to grow on me."
5,Phil's Ashes of the Wake review,Excellent metal. The music is really good and heavy. Deep growling vocals with somewhat poltical lyrics. Overall very good. If you like metal then get this. You won't regret it.
5,"""Now I've got something to die for!""","This is by far the best LoG album to date. LoG CDs are hard to come by here in my country because it was never released here. I was introduced to this band by listening to the immortal ""Black Label"". I've been a fan eversince. The overall musicianship has improved compared to their previous albums. The Vocals are more clear and brutal and showcased Randy Blythe's Vocal Range. This should be the standard for ALL METAL ALBUMS! LoG Kicks A**!!!"
5,The kings of modern metal,"With this album, Lamb of God secure their slot as leaders of modern metal, and on their forthcoming tour they will be headlining over established acts Fear Factory and Children of Bodom which is quite an accomplishment. Simply put this is probably their best release so far, but New American Gospel is right behind it. Lamb of God really didn't change their sound much but they certainly improved with better production, and non stop shredding with riffs galore, and as always brutal breakdowns that make you want to punch the floor and jump in the pit. My favorite LoG song of all time is on here, ""Now you've got something to die for"". Other good songs are ""What I've Become"" and ""Laid to Rest"", but what am I saying people? This is a Lamb of God album, every song is simply amazing. If you like Lamb of God I highly recommend these other amazing bands: Chimaira, On Broken Wings, Throwdown, Devildriver, Darkest Hour, Unearth, Terror, etc."
4,The Evolution of Heavy Music,"The new Lamb of God album, ""Ashes of the Wake"" is an incredible step forward in the ever changing and ever growing genre that we call heavy metal. Lamb of God is one of the top bands in the world and they just solidify that with this great new album. I really look forward to more from them in the future."
2,"was good, but lost its luster","like too much american ""metal"" these days, this album was great for the first week or two. then you realize that what you're hearing is WAAAY too much production applied to the same 4 or 5 riffs which are then just repeated. once those riffs go stale, the album is worthless. the only song on here i could see myself listening to for years is ""one gun"", and that is more about the lyrics and meaning of the song than the song itself."
3,Please give them back their riffs,"Don't get me wrong I do like this band with it's raw sound, chunky guitars, and awesome drumming. The only problem is I can't stand the over use of Slayer riffs. Come on guys, you found your sound but lose the the Slayer touch. Think I'm blowing smoke? You decide:1. End of ""Faded Line"" = ""South of Heaven""2. Beginning of ""Hour Glass"" = ""Reign in Blood""3. Beginnig of ""What I've Become"" = ""Epidemic""And so many more but I have become tiresome."
4,Really good album.,"This is probably my favorite Lamb of God Album. Getting into vinyl recordings as of late, I decided to get ""Ashes of the Wake"" in LP form. I am specifically reviewing the vinyl recording, which is pretty good. Compared to other digitally recorded or re-mastered albums that are pressed onto 180 gram vinyl, the sound quality is mediocre, but still favorable. It is pretty cool that newer recordings are even being pressed in vinyl, so I'm happy to have it to add to my collection.I would like to say; if you are new to vinyl, all recordings are not made equal, and this one is just OK. It does come with a free digital download to get the same album in MP3 format for free."
2,Disappointing,"I'd like to start by saying how amazing New American Gospel is. Then by saying what a solid follow-up As The Palaces Burn is. Lamb of God is truly one of the best American thrash/metalcore acts.However, If you enjoy either of their first releases, I would recommend skipping this one. It's disappointing and generic. If you're considering buying this and don't own the previous albums, buy them first. Lamb of God is an aggressive, technically skilled band, and I really expect their next release to be a comeback after this one."
5,The Face of Real Metal,"For any of us out there that were searching for the Real Heavy Metal band of the future, then we found them in Lamb of God. Forget what is called nu-metal, that is not metal at all. Lamb of God is metal and this album is one of the best Metal albums to come out in the 21st century. You're not going to find bands like Slayer anymore, but I think this album brings us as close as we're going to get to anything like that. Can't wait to see them on tour with Fear Factory."
5,Mind Blowing,This album is incrediable I can't stop listening to it.I hope this will be the album of the year.
4,"good Thrash metal, NOT emo/hardcore/gay","just so you get my bearing, i listen to real metal (Judas Priest, Venom, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Megadeth....) this is good 'modern thrash' some parts comparable to classic Rust In Peace riffs (Megadeth), i wont lie. but listen kids, stop pretending to make Lamb Of God a f***ing hardcore band. they arent, they are more thrash than anything. (they dont do all the gay hardcore riff cliches and screams/singing, ie Shadows Fall, Unearth) and stop comparing them to Killswitch Engage! (KsE is way more girl-oriented, listen to the 'clean vocals') they DONT sound the same, just because girls like both doesnt mean they are the same kind of music. if your favorite bands are Lamb Of God AND Killswitch Engage (or any new 'metalcore') then do the real metal world a favor and stop listening to LoG."
2,Stale as year old bread.,"This is like listening to a teenage girl: lot's to say but nothing to hear.Songs that go on but go nowhere.Little variation and even less melody.One star for obviously technically talented musicianship. Gotta give 'em that.One more star for being heavy.If you want a good metal, try Shadows Fall, Killswitch Engage, In Flames, and Bloodbath."
2,"DOnt buy this.....buy Killswitch, Unearth or Shadows Fall","Okay, okay.the guy below this is right and wrong.This album is NOT that great. and it is mediocre. He is also right that Shadows Fall's The WAr Within is better. BUT I strongly(X10) disagree with his statement of the other bands Godforbid,Killswitch engage,Unearth. Godforbid does suck.... BUT Killswitch Engage and Unearth deserves mass praise for their latest albums.......I own both and think that both are amazing.Comparing this album to either Shadows Fall's, KSE's or Unearth's latest is like comparing a bike to a car......this album is simple and not really that impressive whereas the others are.I urge anyone thats looking into buying this album, instead to buy either Shadows Fall's, KSE's or Unearth's latest because.....they are 10000000000 times better and totally worth your money"
5,Chill with the hatin!,"I dont know what some of these reviewers are talkin about. You guys are saying how, ""if you want some real metal, listen to atreyu"" Are you serious? This album, from start to finsh is straight punishing. Willie Adler and Mark Morton and probly the most talented and creative guitarists in metal today. Yeah the vocals might take some gettin used to for all you poison fans but it rips. Why is everyone worried about LOG sounding like Megadeath or Metallica? We are in a new age!! That stuff is great dont get me wrong but metal is heading in a new direction. If you dont like it,oh well. Anyways this record is LOG at their best. Theyve improved in their writing both musically and lyrically. It sounds awesome, every breakdown makes you want to break everything you own. Totally awesome, definite must have for any metalcore fan"
3,I was expecting a bit more from a major label debut,"For starters, I really do like this album. ""Laid to Rest"" is an awesome metal track. However, I just do not feel that this album is on par with ""As the Palaces Burn"". They have fixed some problems from their earlier releases, with the most obvious fix being that Randy's vocals are no longer consistently drowned out by the rest of the band. Opposing the progress of the fixed problems are some mediocre songs by Lamb of God standards. I would still get this one if you are a fan, just don't expect another ""Palaces"", or you'll be disappointed."
3,Good but it does need Devin back in studio.,When I heard the songs off the LOG I felt something was lacking. The music was pretty much straight forward but it made me feel like I was listening to New American Gospel again and I hated that album. At least Blythe's voice did improve from that album for ATPB and AOTW. I really think they need to bring Devin back to producing for them. I felt that ATPB had more of a wall of sound. You could hear weird background stuff added in and almost gave LOG an industrial deathmetal tinge. I don't really find any of that on this album. Please guys go back and get Devin I think he really improved the band on ATPB. They really need him again.
3,It Ain't all that But still good,It really deserves 3.5 stars actually. I will give LOG props for keeping true and still staying heavy as hell. But honestly this record was rushed and does not display this bands full potential. How much can a band possibly grow in 1 year?! Not really much! There are a couple of bad ass songs here but as a whole it falls kind of flat on its face. The one bright side is that the production is killer! But even amazing production can not cover up repetition. Boys and girls spend your hard earned cash on the new MASTODON instead.
2,recorded in a toilet,"Look i love everything hard from machinehead,chimaira to cannibal corpse and deicide, but this is tripe. The drumming and singing are fine, but the guitars are woeful. Not the playing but the actual sound, if i want to listen to poorly recorded guitars i will listen to crappy euro black metal like impaled nazrene and satrycon, people if you like guitars that sound like they are recorded in a toilet then buy this, if not, don't waste your clams on this."
4,More of Lamb of God's Brutal Metal,"This album follows Lamb of God's tradition of playing brutally hardcode metal. It's a more than adequate follow up to As The Palaces Burn.However, the main reason I posted this is to rebutt plainwhite's review by simply by pointing out that he gave Metallica's Load album four stars and Everlast's Whitey Ford Sings The Blues five stars. Obviously, he's not a metal fan. Consider the source, chilluns..."
4,Accessible metal for even the not-so-well-versed..,"I got a copy of this disc from a friend... I'm hooked. I'll admit, I am not a metalhead by any stretch (this sits next to Al Green in the jukebox, you get the idea), but I really like this album. This CD has all the components of good metal: the guitar riffs are articulate, the drums have that metal throbbing pulse which sounds so cool, and the vocals are sufficiently throaty/gravelly/hellish sounding. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because some of the tracks lack originality... some of this CD could just be one long track. Otherwise, everything sounds good and would be a worthwhile purchase."
4,An excellent all around album,"I'm not as much into Metalcore and the other styles Lamb of God is built on, but it's still got an American Death Metal edge to it, so I definitely enjoy this album. Also, the lyrics are deceptively well written. From a critical point of view, many of Lamb of God's albums have a hard time of keeping the interest high in the later half of the album and for some reason a way to close out the album just isn't found or reached. Ashes of the Wake actually closes well, but the vibe I feel is that this is a band that from then on, will not find a different way of acheiving this. So this is why I have have a luke warm feeling about Lamb of God in general, but Ashes of the Wake is their high water mark, and if you look at their lyrical ability, abrasive sense of melody, musicianship, the successful communication of bleakness towards the listener, despite some minor short comings, it's no surprise how well liked Lamb of God is."
3,Christian's stay away,"I AM a pretty religious guy, so thats pretty much the ONLY reason why i rated them a 3... i actually have all 3 albums and have had them for quite some time. on a musical standpoint these guys are phenominal, the drummer (which was a friend of the band [who didnt know how to play before 'ashes of the wake']) is amazing... the guitar lines and outstanding (although not 100% original), and the vocals make it sound like he sold his soul to the devil (especially in the song ""vigil"" from 'as the palaces burn'...i REALLY wish these guys weren't against Christianity so much.. I would never put the cd away if that were the case... it's just a little distressing to me.BUY THIS CD (and their others) if you don't mind the ""slaughtering of the lambs"" kinda vibe lol...DONT BUY THIS CD if your against the above ^^"
3,Awesome music but vocals need to go,The music and songs are incredible but the vocals sound exactly the same throughout the whole album without any fluxuation or variation. I love screams and growls but the singer just doesnt seem to be all that talented.
4,Same experience. Not explicit,"I thought this might have been fixed, after the previous reviewer's issue, but it isn't. This isn't the explicit version. Although I will say, Amazon was very pleasant and prompt to refund my money for the purchase, though.I like the service and the products here, I just wish I had the whole song(s).btw, the album is great."
5,MUST BUY!!!,This CD is an instant favorite. All the songs are great and the riffs are too. The entire Cd from strt to finish is brutal!Laid to Rest- 9/10Hourglass-10/10Now You've Got Something To Die For- 11/10The Faded Line-9/10Omerta-8/10Blood of the Scribe- 8/10One Gun-7/10Break You-8/10What I've Become-9/10Ashes Of The Wake-9/10Remorse Is For The Dead-7/10
2,Not very good.,"I took a chance on this CD because I'd heard one cut on the radio that I'd liked--but that turned out to be the only cut I liked. I was quite offended by some of the stupid, angry, creepy lyrics, and the music wasn't very pleasant to the ear either. Oooo, she's such a rebel. Only, not so much."
2,"Sounds great live, not so good on the album.","I heard multiple live recordings and got very excited. Thought this might be the modern musical savoir that I was waiting for. She might still be, but not on this album. I believe lots of ""production crap"" would be the appropriate tag line for the way that her smart and refreshing sound has been slaughtered on this release. There is a bunch of smoke and mirrors that she doesn't need. I'm disapointed to say the least. The thought of hearing it live is still inticing. For me, at least, she sounds better alone at the piano. Anybody want to buy a Nellie McKay CD? I'm selling cheap."
2,Bait and Switch,"I heard Nellie on NPR's, ""Morning Edition"", with Bob Edwards. She was playing a piano and singing. I was so excited by what I heard, it was definitely a 5 star performance. I was planning to buy this album. Then I read one of the Amazon reviews which alerted me to the fact that it wasn't just Nellie and a piano. As I listened to the samples of the same songs that I heard on NPR, I became disappointed. The reviewer was right, a great premier album was ruined by drum machines, synthesizers and noise. Nellie, next time just you, a piano and your imagination. Oh, an acoustic bass and drums would be just fine too."
3,well...it's different,"well it is different. at least she's not just another teen pop princess but i'm wondering if it's too different that most people might not be ready to appreciate it, me included. i kind of like it but i don't know if i can listen to the whole disc. i am curious about why there is a parental advisory sticker on it, of course i only listened to the samples but she didn't seem to need them."
4,One of the best albums of 2004,"As has been said by many of the reviewers here, McKay's wit and versatility really help her debut album to stand out. I also agree with the reviewer who said that some songs are among the best of the year, but others are the opposite. All of disc one is excellent, but only ""Won't U Please B Nice?"" and ""Clonie"" really stand out on the second. Nevertheless, the strongest tracks on the album (""The Dog Song,"" ""David,"" ""Sari,"" ""Change the World,"" and ""Ding Dong"") are also among the strongest tracks released in 2004, and hopefully her next album will capitalize on the strengths of those."
5,THE BEST IN A LONG TIME,"funny, irreverant, sincere, insincere, clever, cunning, thoughtful, provoking, engaging. the cd has it all for me. interestingly produced by geoff emerick of the Beatles and others fame. it reminds me of one of Geoff Emericks other Cds elvis costello's imperial bedroom. you cant really judge this cd quickly. the music is so interesting, the production carries some of the best of music used to be when people played and there were no computers. i love this cd and play it for a long time. i am typically not a female singer, broadway or orchestral fan but this cd transends all boundaries. there is truly some musical genius in the songwriting."
3,Too overproduced!,"I first heard Nellie McKay on a solo set she did on ""Sounds Eclectic"". It was just her and a piano and it was great! This album is waaay too overproduced. All the background singers and studio instruments and noises and other stuff really take away from what are really great songs. It just really clutters up the sound and has a pop album feel. It could have been a lot more with a lot less."
5,Essential Album of 2004,"Where to begin? This is a one-two, double-""White""-album punch, produced by the engineer of that Beatles' masterpiece. Nellie McKay's a 19-year-old with Mark Twain's/George Bernard Shaw's ironic sense of humor and the voice of Ella Fitzgerald and Doris Day (when she's doing jazz). She's a funny, biting lyricist, an expert songwriter and arranger, and gifted pianist -- all at once. The musical root of the songs on this album are piano lounge pieces, re-arranged and polished in this presentation, and range from classic big-band/jazz (""Manhattan Avenue"", ""I Wanna Get Married"") to a rap effort that sounds more Broadway (""Sari"") to disco (""Waiter""). But all of this is very much her own style, which is some fusion of all of the above, and all of it is extremely catchy and hummable. An exciting debut!"
5,An amazing debut!,"Nellie McKay is brilliant. No 19 year old should have this much polish and verve. Her music--all original--is extremely strong and diverse (show tunes to rap) and she sells everything with a brassy gusto that is amazing to behold. I recommend this set to all my friends and if Nellie sells worldwide the way she's selling in Minnesota, she'll have a long and rewarding career. What a talent!"
5,Incredible.,"Nellie is one of the most original, moving artists I have heard in a very long time. You will see right off the bat she is nothing like anything you've heard before. Her songs are utterly unusual and full of joy. Just don't pass this one up."
2,So much better live.,"I listened to some of her live tracks on her website, and I was struck by how spunky and cool she was. I ordered the CD. When I popped it into the player, it sounded like pop-y junk. The core song was there, but most of the songs became overproduced. The live versions are just her at the piano. It was simple and she got to play. In these tracks, they stick in a bunch of off sound effects. Too many ""awes"" and sound effects. I felt schizophrenic listening to it. There are a few songs that I did enjoy on the CD, but otherwise, I'd recommend waiting for the live CD."
3,"Nice idea; hard to listen to all the way through, though","What immediately grabbed my attention about this album was when I found out that it was supposed to be a parody title of Norah Jones's ""Come Away with Me"". And much of the work here is pretty interesting and shows that she's pretty ambitious, especially for an artist who's just started having a two-album set. That being said, it's sometimes hard to handle it the full way. I recommend listening to it in snippets instead. It does have moments (""Sari"", ""Let's Get Married""), but it's too varied for me (which says A LOT) and some of her messages are a little bit too much for me. If you put those points aside, it's a nice enough little album though. I totally admire the album and it's not bad, but it's also not one of my favorites."
3,"Cool, quirky, intelligent, unmoving...","I like Nellie because she is unique and interesting. She is a fun listen the first few times because she has a crafty way of writing. Quite intelligent. BUT:The album lacks a cohesiveness. Too many genres wrapped into one. She is too busy being ""cute and quirky"" and not about emotional content. All and all, she is well beyond her years (she was 19 when she wrote this album), but it is completely unmoving, and it becomes boring quickly. She is very talented on the piano, and her voice is reminiscent of Fiona Apple. This is an OK album. Better than a lot out there. If you are looking for fun, this is a cool CD. If you are looking to be moved, move on!"
2,She's clearly talented. But..,"With the release of ""Pretty Little Head,"" I decided to revisit the much talked about debut of Nellie McKay, ""Get Away From Me."" Bottom line is this: she's got chops. She can sing and play. Her songwriting can frequently be inspired. But the raps are clumsy and ill executed and sometimes there's no point to the noise. Unfortunately, I'd say ""Pretty Little Head"" improves on the formula only slightly. She's clearly got her fans, but I won't be one of them until potential is realized."
3,"Most of the time... good, clean fun","This album has been sitting in my wish list for a while and the other day I decided to just buy the unedited version. Mistake on my part. The actual melodies and music are superb. They are often reminiscent of a 50's musical. But take my advice, if you don't care for interspersed vulgarity buy the clean version, don't go by the album cover on this one she has a real potty mouth. I'm exchanging the one I bought for the clean one. All in all it was a good buy, because of the refreshing way it's put together and interesting style she has of singing."
3,Pointless use of 2 CDs,"The music is good, maybe even great, but I have to comment on the fact that the album is spread over 2 CDs. This is probably some sort of artsy thing I don't get but it's a waste of resources and misleading. There's only about 60 minutes of music here and no extras. Less than a single disc."
4,"Get Away from Me, Nellie McKay","I love her more quirky songs and her voice is great but I was a little disappointed that a good number of the songs seemed a bit more traditional in style. However, her lyrics are very funny."
4,Whoa Nellie!,"When I first started to listen to ""Get Away From Me"", it was like a joke, that I didnt get. Luckily I listened to the entire two discs, before i made a judgement. As it played on I ""got it"" more and more. It's like a black comedy. VERY creative, and I can honestly say I've never heard anything like it.There is such a range of music on this album. I prefer the more upbeat songs, the slower ones are a little too Norah Jones, though the lyrics are MUCH smarter. This is becoming a favorite the more I listen to it. Nellie McKay is a True talent."
4,"She's a nut--but a colorful, genuine nut","Nellie McKay(the M.C .on the DVD pronounces it ""Mc-eye"")has an unplaceable accent, a faraway glint in her scheming eyes, and a tart sense of humor that catches you totally unawares. She's an honest-to-God original, and a breath of fresh air in these calculated-pop times. Her music careens between different inspirations, and she's juggles them all like a pro. My favorites are the whimsical ""David"", the plaintive ""Really"", the humorous/serious ""I Wanna Get Married"" and the comical ""Clonie"". ""Married"" really epitomizes McKay--sardonic, rueful, but wistful and longing. You can hear the yearning in her voice even as she spouts scattershot poetry. The DVD is a wonderful(but brief)concert in San Francisco, and her in-between patter is constantly surprising. You never know where she's gonna take you."
1,Am I missing the boat?,"I am amazed that this artist has received so many 5 star reviews. I bought this album based upon the reviews, and I don't think I have ever been more disappointed in a purchase. I was expecting an artist with an amazing talent. I was thinking a Norah Jones, or Sarah Brightman, or a female Harry Connick Jr. Nope .. so far completely the opposite direction. I kept skipping from one song to the next trying to find any semblance of decent music ... completely without luck.Why this album is so loved by some amazes me. Maybe I am missing something .. but if anyone wants to buy my CD for cheap let me know!"
1,Caveat,"I bought this cd with very high hopes, having read all the customer reviews here on amazon.com. There's no doubt that Nellie McKay has musical talent. It's just a shame that she hasn't got anything coherent to say. Unless you to try deliberately to tune them out, it's hard to get past the strident petulance of her lyrics. Musical wunderkind that she is, let's give Ms. McKay a few years. . . maybe she'll grow up a little."
1,Not very good,I heard all the hype and raving reviews so I bought this CD. Unfortunately there is not one song on it that I like. Very disappointing. Though her lyrics can be clever there are no hooks or grooves. Why have two CD's when it all could fit on one? Beats me as does the question why do so many people like this CD?
2,"received as a gift, didn't like.",Think this artist is a total poseur. Give me Johnny Cash any day over this junk
4,Change the world?,"Maybe. Who gets your vote -- Radiohead? Please. I don't know about you, but I've always thought a good deal of what currently ails us could be remedied by getting the lovechild of Cole Porter and Nico in a studio with George Martin and Kanye West behind the boards and just let that gal rip...."
3,I can only review one half of this album,"I really wish she had just released the entire album on one disc because when I was taking out the second disc, it was so tighting jammed in there that the CD cracked on me and I can only review the first CD. What I have listened to by Nellie Mckay shows a brash, intelligent songwriter and a somewhat understated performer. The music seems to always upstage her. She shifts styles, from modern day alterna-folk, to jazz, to rap. I think that at this point she's a bit too raw to be appreciated by me. I find myself wanting to get into these songs, but her delivery is sometimes too callow to want to get behind. None of this is taking away from the writing, but she's just got to tighten to screws a little bit and then she'll be a force to be reckoned with."
2,"Great singer, glad she left her label","A beautiful voice with some interesting nonstandard formats. Nellie is very refreshing and I would refer her to anybody in a second. BUT!!! this lousy label she recorded this wonderful music on limits me from hearing her on all my listening devices. This is a locked (anti-theft) CD so I can't import to my iPod (thanks SO very much). It plays only on my main stereo equipment, not my Mac or car stereo. In other words, it's an event if I want to listen to her music. I can't casually listen to Nellie. I say, Nellie, Get Away From THEM! I'm glad you left that label! Good luck to you! I hope all recording artists wake up and free themselves from this horrible, limiting ""locked"" format! Nellie gets 5 stars. Recording label, a negative 100000000. By the way, just download this from the iTunes store."
3,Amazing songstress--So much better live...,"My friend gave me this CD to listen to, and then dragged me to see Nellie recently when she played at the Crocodile Cafe in Seattle. The music is so much better live even if her fans are, well, weird (sorry, but lovesick mooning and then yelling at people to shut up at a concert in a bar is strange-- If you want to listen in silence, go back home and put your headphones on). After hearing her in person, it seemed as if her jazzy postmodern Doris Day/Rosemary Clooney style was erased in post-production in an attempt to become more mainstream. Live, ""Sari"" was one of my favorite songs; on the CD it seemed like a pathetic Madonna-esque attempt at rapping. Hopefully she'll be able to put out another album where her true style can shine."
2,"ORIGINAL, KIND OF...","I bought this based on the hearing the song, Its A Pose. Not bad. The music is OK, just OK. It is, however a great effort for a nineteen year old musically. There is some stuff on here I liked, the work Song and Won't you Please B nice. I give her all the credit in the world for being out there, but by the second or third listen I was kind of bored. Her lyrics tend to show her age, not really new ideas politically, just sounds like she took some PETA, Greenpeace, NOW and DNC ramblings that were handed out in a pamphlet on a street corner and set it music. Or maybe had an 11th grade honors English Class' poetry squeezed into her muisical arrangement (see I wanna get married or change the world). But hey, I was 19 once too.""I was so much older then, I am younger than that now."""
5,The future is Nellie,"I worshipped Nellie at the Birchmere on 1/22 while she performed nearly everything on ""Get away from me"" intermixed with her new creations from Sony's unreleased ""Pretty Little Head."" Yes... I'm infatuated. Nellie is imperfect in nearly every category, but she fills so many categories - including irresistable sprite - that her shortcomings are not only over lookable, but trite in recitation. She's precocious, brilliant, charming, and a perfectionist that can't let a mistake go by without restarting a song in mid-concert. Watch this space... one day you will wish you kept that ticket-stub because it will trade for ungodly value when Nellie's trancendent talent matures and explodes like a Respectable Member of Society."
1,Shoot Me,"She is one of the worst artists I have ever heard sing, if you want to call it singing, it's more like heart wrenching wailing. It is not that I don't enjoy her type of music, I love any type of music. However, every song she sings makes me feel like I'm spining out of control and will throw up. She is even worse in concert. I recently saw her live and lauged so hard as did the security guards and other members of the audience. The loudest applause of the night was when she left the stage. I would not reccomend buying this CD unless you want to give it to your worst enemy, and even that would be cruel and unusual punishment."
3,let's hope she improves next time...,"Well, I gave this three stars because I like to encourage originality, and it's refreshing that Nellie writes her own songs. But honestly, I don't enjoy these songs. A lot of them sound too similar, and when Nellie tries to rap, it's just horrible!! She should not try to emulate M&M because that's just not good music. Sometimes she can sound like Doris Day, but, other times her voice is just annoying. This is a very frustrating debut because there is potential here, but for her next album Nellie needs to decide to become more of a singer and less of a ""rap star"". The only song I enjoyed was Madison Avenue"
5,the real thing,"reviewers are tripping all over themselves coming up with stylistic comparisons, most along the lines of 'doris day meets eminem.' what mckay really is is a witty, crafty singer-songwriter with wide-ranging musical influences. the music is sharp, the lyrics are barbed...how about 'dorothy parker meets elvis costello'? or how about: just buy it. like, now."
2,Cheryl Pierson,"I tend to agree with the other reviewers that there is simply not enough facts to support the topic of this book. Cheryl Pierson happens to be a distant cousin of mine. Her grandmother and my mother were first cousins. There was a lot more in the family background than was written about, which would perhaps shed some light on the personalities of the famly members. The characters were not fleshed out whatsoever, leaving them to be somewhat emotionless. It seemed just be be a book to grab your attention and leave you hungry for more.The TV movie mirrored this book."
2,Creative Writing Class,Author needs to go back to Creative Writing 101 and dismiss two-thirds of this book. That two thirds has little or nothing to do with the subject at hand- it's just book filler. The other third of the book is on target.
2,"Not that good,","This is the true story of how after years of sexual abuse by her father, a teenage girl kills him. Read this over 10 years ago, but nothing really stands out about this book. I can't remember any names or even the locale, it may have been New York or New Jersey, maybe Ohio. ..."
3,Still the legendary group,"While I enjoyed reading the book when it first came out, I did find it sad that such books hit the shelves. I can sympathize with Mary and how she was feeling way back when and I hope in writing her books she is able to move on and put the past behind her. It may be difficult to believe but I do feel she has genuine affection for Diana Ross. As with any friend, it's hard to see one of you move on and achieve worldwide success while the other watches it happen. Today I think Mary has grown and is just beginning to make peace with the past and her own emotions and for that I say bravo. We are fans of the Supremes and what is hard to see is how fans pit one Supreme against another. We fell in love with the group as a whole and should continue to respect each individual member. Happy reading,"
5,Congratulations Mary!,"Mary Wilson has rereleased ""Dreamgirl"", the best selling Rock & Roll Biography of all time, along with her second book which focuses on The 70's Supremes & beyond. When Mary wrote Dreamgirl she made history in being the first Motown Artist to break rank with the company & tell the truth as much as it could be told without a lawsuit. Trust me, there IS much, much more to tell. If you compile all Motown related books by those who were there and those who weren't, Mary's rings very, very true. Much truer than some others."
3,the fascination with motown,"well, the book itself is ok,i was just a little bored with diane this, and diane that, was diane the only supreme ? i felt it focused on too much on diane ross, and when flo was really sick why didn't anyone put a hold on their careers and try to help her financially and physically? i know if it were my sister or best of friend everything would be on hold, if anyone did try to help her it was not disclosed in this story, so forgive me if i am wrong but i did not read it here, but thank you mary wilson for sharing your story...jglover"
1,Running Out of Ways to Bash Diana?,"Poor Mary, Hasn't she run out of ways to Bash Diana to stay in the public eye? I.m sure she'll come up with a new book ...maybe titled"" How I destroyed The Return To Love Tour""! Diana can't sing with Former Ladies Of The Supremes, but I can tour with 2 unknowns and bill myself as Mary Wilson & The Supremes! Maybe a good subtitle for the next book could be ""Double Standard""!"
4,Great Refrence,This was a very good book. It sets you up to teach your dog to think about the commands you give rather than following patterns. If the exercises are followed correctly it does not set your dog up for failure as a previous review stated. Rather it makes sure that your dog understand what it is supposed to do regardless of what is going on around it. I found her methods to make a lot more sense to me than the positive only training where there are no consequnces if the dog chooses to willfully disobey. The methods described are humane and it is fairly easy to follow.
4,Yes!,"The greatest thing this book gave me is and overview of the entire training process. Diane outlines training with the goal of producing a well trained dogs for advanced competition. Diane has some great comments about how dogs think, and how we as handlers sometimes scare our dog out of work he or she might otherwise be perfectly happy to do for us. She writes in nice short chapters which are easy to digest, and the book has manyexcelent photographs to illustrate the techniques described."
4,This book makes sense,"I have read ten zillion books on dog training and this is my very favourite. I am comfortable with most of the training techniques outlined in the book, except that a few of the corrections are too severe for my taste. For the most part, I think this is a very fair and humane approach to dog training. I highly recommend this book."
2,complete training pattern but coercion based training,"When then book originally came out it was quite forward thinking in its methodology. Fortunately for our dogs there has been a quiet revolution in dog training to a less coercive method of training. For example, her method of teaching sit involves pulling up on the collar while pushing on the dog. In short physical discomfort is being created for a command that the dog does not even know. Her methods are based on negative reinforcement. The correct response will make the discomfort vanish. This type of training can be effective if you have the right dog for the stress it will produce and if you the handler have great timing and can always perfectly and rapidly make all pressure vanish when the performance is correct."
5,Dog training must have,This book teaches all aspects of competitive dog training using positive methods. Excellent resource guide for both the experienced and or novice trainer. I have given it to my friends as a gift and they were delighted.
1,"Old-fashioned, correction-based methods.","Bauman's book is very old-fashioned. Her method involves setting the dog up to fail and then punishing him for doing so, rather than setting him up to succeed and reinforcing the desired behavior. Once, methods like Bauman's were all we had -- ""correction"" was accepted as the only way to train a dog. But there are SO many better, more positive, more reliable, and more fun (for you and the dog) ways of training now. I see no reason why anyone would stick with this stuff when there's a better way. Not recommended."
1,Harsh methods and out-dated techniques,"I was very disappointed in this book. The author advocates the old fashioned training methods of correction for wrong behavior vs. the newer methods of positive reinforcement for correct behavior. She states that we should pinch our dogs lips and ears to teach them to retrieve. She believes spraying our dogs with a hose is a good way to teach them to drop on recall. She states that they ""have been known to throw metal chairs"" at big dogs to get them to come. But then reminds us to put a longline on them so they don't run away instead. Wouldn't you run away? She even devotes a chapter expaining why our dogs are stressed while learning. Of course any dog would be stressed by the training methods she advocates. There are many books available that use positive methods for training that will give us success in the show ring without these harsh methods that this book suggests."
2,The extras are better,"""Graveyard"" (2 stars) was pretty awful. 24 hours store employees on night shift suddenly realize that they have joined the rank of the undead. They then try to figure out how this happened. The plot doesn't even make sense; the acting, even for a low budget short film, is pretty awful. They don't even try. Now, apart from this pretty awful short film, the extras are excellent. The extras include a short film called ""Living with the dead"" which is really good. It even has better acting and a better story. It is about a guy who finds a dead guy (one of the living dead) in his apartment one morning and what ensues thereafter. This was pretty darn good. The extras also include a movie titled ""Film # 3"" which would have been at least interesting if it had been a bit longer and had attempted to create the semblance of a story. The only thing interesting about this DVD is ""Living with the dead"" (3.5 stars) which is really good."
5,A high quality book with facts about the three most important coloured stones.,"An good insight into the trade for the consumer. It is easy-to-read, filled with great colour pictures, and with descriptions in everyday language that even the non-professional can easily understand. I recommend it to everyone.For further important reading i suggest You coplete Your collection with the Enhancement-books by the author Ted Themelis (please search with the name of the Author to find the books in question)."
1,This book is not serious .,I was hoping for a more serious book with new facts and price evaluations. At least show examples and more pictures.The author did a very bad job with this book its childish and not informing anything special even the internet can give you better stuff to read .DONT BUY THIS BOOKregardsMaxamed Aden
1,doesnt work at all,"it wasn't I expected, doesn't work and imposible to put in your ears. Are too flufy and loose their form, i dont recomend this kind of earplugs"
4,They work great.,"I'm a big fan of these. I have them bedside, in my laptop bag for when I'm traveling, and in my make bag. Very handy to plug out the noise :)"
1,plugs don't stay in ears,I found these plugs to be unusable. They slip out of my ears (no matter how well I try to insert them) and provide VERY little soundproofing.
5,Best so far,My husband uses these and said that they are the best as of yet that he has used to keep the noise out.
3,Great as long as its on,"The ear plugs are great to keep water out. I have had major ear issues due to swimming and water getting into my ears. Bought this set and I thought it would be a perfect solution. Well, it is a solution but far from perfect. The ear plugs do a great job of keeping water out, but they are constantly falling off. I have tried several things to keep them inside, but I continue to have this problem. Will need to look for another design."
4,Not much choice for laminate trimmers,"I investigated all the different brands of laminate trimmers and the dewalt seems to be the one with the most accesories. Most people think that the old PC 310 is the best one, but you can't get any bases for it anymore. Since I needed the offset base for some tight spaces I went ahead with the Dewalt.Like some other reviews the standard base wasn't square - probably off by 15 degrees - so I called dewalt and they shipped me a new one right away. This one is almost square which is close enough for me.With the replacement base it works fine. Some people might be upset that the kit came with a machining defect - but now days with prices being so low and everything made off shore you need to expect these things to happen. I'm pleased that Dewalt made it right without any fuss. So I give it four stars."
4,Pretty good tool,"I had this trimmer now for about 5 years and I do like it. I still haven't used the angle base but I have used the other bases. It is powerful and I sometimes use it for routing jobs where a larger router would be better. That said, I wish it came with a seaming kit. Also, dewalt tools seem to be a little on the loud side. I use power tools almost everyday and I appreciate a quieter tool. (I once brought a dewalt jigsaw only to exchange it two days later for a bosch jigsaw) That's why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5."
2,Comparison User,I have both this trimmer and the comparable Porter Cable 7301. The Porter Cable is the better designed and somoother running unit. For the price difference I'd get the PC model.Not a bad machine just not as good as the PC model.
3,Good and bad,This product works good the only problem is that using ps2 controllers its not pressure sensative like xbox and that when firing your gun in halo for example its like burst fireing so its a little slow and you cant lock on with rocket launcher since you cant do half trigger. But other wise they work great
3,Its Handy,"Guys always say they can beat me if we played on PS2. This adapter lets you use a PS2 controller on the Xbox. This product will ultimately see whos better. The buttons are the same, so no more excuses"
4,What it was meant to be,"Good Item, no problems! now i can prove to all those Madden XBOX guru's that I am the ultimate Madden Guru and no more controller issues MUAHAHAHHA lol"
1,Too slow...we may wait for 6 weeks or more.,"I can't say anything becuase I haven't got any magazine and even notice from Amazon, and Horn Book Magazine. Defer from regular shipping process, magazine shipping process is all pre-historic..."
5,Janeway's Cadet Years at Acadey,"This book was about Janeway's first away Mission. She got stuck in quarintine at a planet and has to get out. But this is a problem for her and her fellow Cadet's. How will they get out? This book is very interesting, expecialy if you like Star Trek. I thought that the book should get five stars because of the discripsion. I like how in the book Janeway is Friends with Gordie, a character on the Next Generation show. I hope that you will read this book."
4,Great Mock Turtlenecks,Great Turtlenecks for the price! Material is comfortable to wear and the size was right in line. I would definitely buy them again.
2,Shrek sizes,"I ordered two shirts. Both arrived over packaged and took two days for overnight shipping.After reading some reviews, I expected something like a Tshirt with a mock turtleneck. The shirt is thicker than a Tshirt. I find it similar to a very thin sweat shirt without that fuzzy stuff on the inside. I am pleased with the quality.I should have listened to other reviewers when they discussed size issues. I ordered a medium and this thing is huge. I washed it in hot water, dried twice with superhot air and it is still way too big. After washing and drying, I held the shirt next to one of my medium Hanes' longsleeve pullovers. The shoulder points of the turtleneck were approx 21.5 inches compared to the Hanes at 18 inches. I did not measure before washing.Three stars were deducted for the Shrek sizing."
3,Thin Material,"I received this shirt yesterday, and I'm a little surprised by how thin it is. It's just the same thickness as a regular t-shirt. It's good for wearing under another shirt, but it's not heavy enough to be the one and only mock turtle shirt in your wardrobe.I won't return it, I ordered it as an experiment to see what the Port Authority brand was like. I'll keep it and wear it to places where I'd wear a t-shirt, but I wouldn't wear it to a restaurant or party unless I was going to wear a nicer shirt over it.Overall I'd say it's just an OK shirt. If you want something nicer look for something heavier."
1,Poor Quality,I laundered this shirt once and it now looks a year old. I recommend you find another manufacturer of mock necks.
1,Poorly sized Mock Tneck,I ordered a women's 2X mock Tneck. It is definitely a man's shirt. Shoulders are huge and sleeves are at least five inches too long. Will not order again.
4,Port Authority Mock turtleneck,Good quality. Fits well. Tight knit.Comfortable. Priced fairly. Wouldbuy again. Very easy to wash inautomatic washer and use dryerwith no shrinkage. Would buyagain.
3,Mock Turtleneck - for men,"This turtleneck is more for men than women. I bought a size medium because personal reviews said they ran large. Even the medium is too big and long on me...I normally wear a ladies Large. So if you are buying for a woman, order smaller than you normally would. Turtleneck is sturdily made and I will probably wear it for sport. It is too bulky to wear under a top blouse which is what I wanted. Recommend for men only."
4,nice enough,it was cut nice and full; I haven't washed it yet to see if that may be a little large for a reason
5,I own them ALL!,"I have reviewed almost every A2ZCDS advertising product because I own them all. I have to say that as a student with an interest in advertising, these have been tremendously helpful with my understanding and knowledge of advertising of the past. All the products have helped in one way or another with a paper, or an exam. These are all a must have for anyone in my situation."
3,The sound of the Fled soundtrack,"This cd is one like I have never seen before.I have purchased the cd before and i only listen to 3 songs off of it and to me I will always buy a cd for one song. So I think that the cd could have been better but T-Boz,Monica and DJ Kizzy Rock did their best and held it down for the Fled soundtrack,that's why I rate this cd as three stars"
4,pop-up book making,"Keiko Nakazawa definitely knows her craft. The book is fully informative from the tools needed to traceable templates that you can use on specific projects. Not a book for beginners since the projects are fairly complicated, they can still be done with a little patience and determination. This was the second book i've purchased on the subject and i highly recommend it."
4,My favorite new hobby!,"I bought this book because I was looking for a hobby, and this looked interesting. I am not very artsy, but I thought I handle this. I was right! This book has a lot of very interesting card patterns and is not very difficult. If you have trouble finding some of the supplies it suggests, try a local college bookstore. I have been looking for a stylus and a good ruler for awhile, and found both at a university bookstore today."
1,3 D popup Greeting Cards,"Interesting to look at, but not the least do able for moderately talented card makers. This is for the gifted pop up artist."
2,Sound Quality terrible,"I have Hight Speed Internet & a very nice Laptop XP system. before I bot 50U . I had the Cheap Operator Headset & I was stuck to PC talking but the Quality was better with Ear & mic Operter Headset. Problems I have With dlink 5OU. Disconected, lot of Static. its got some work to do for it to be really compattible. some Dlink software dose respond so I close it open up again then it works. Best way to make call is the Head set. Skype seem worse when I boy a year. before I was paying 2.95 a month & u also have to pay rental phone number & is a seperate fee.the gave us a Rebate by mail on amazon. but print form & cut UPC off package. after u do that u cant send it back. 20.00 also 5 for shipping. if I dont like it Il sell it On craigslist for free. Skype phones rated rated 3. no review has hit 5 star yet. what dose that tell you. 4 star means there lot of people who are having trouble. try to find a 5 star product."
5,A must read for any South Carolina resident,"As a resident of SC for nearly twenty-five years, I was delighted to find a readable, comprehensive history of our state! Dr. Edgar does a wonderful job of inter-weaving the various aspects of SC history into a fine tapestry; he relates economic conditions to religious culture to the political climate to family life to economic conditions... Of special interest to me were the chapters dealing with the political and economic development (or lack thereof) during the years immediately following the Civil War through the turn of the twentieth century. (In fact, this time period would make a great movie!) Kudos to Dr. Edgar for a worthwhile 700+ pages of my time!"
3,Winners write history. Political correctness is now in vogue,"It is evident that Dr. Edgar devoted himself to this work and expended many hours in so doing. I feel that until the last quarter of the book he permitted his undisguised dislike of whites of European lineage to flavor all that he told. And there is no doubt that he performed that scheme in a masterful fashion. I was inthralled early on, but came to wish later that the end would soon be reached. All that Dr. Edgar touched was flavored black or white; the family, the church, the government, the future, perhaps even the weather. Certainly black and white existed side by side but life offers a full plate...all aspects of life, every thought, every action cannot be controlled by such bleakness. Dr. Edgar probably has trouble navigating traffic lights for he seems to see only two shades."
2,A Much Needed Book That Falls Short,"I'm glad to see this book -- one of the few comprehensive histories of SC in decades. It is a clear, easy to read history. However, I was disappointed. Edgar is often too brief with his subject. One example is the Mill Villages. He mentions them, but fails to go into depth, especially in their changes with the decline of the textile industry. He does fairly well with the discussion of the growth of the Republican party, but makes no mention of the Governor's race in the 1970's in which Dorn lost to Edwards. Caused primarily because of the unconstitutional race of Charles ""Pug"" Ravenel, Dorn's loss to Edwards quickened the rise of the Republican party in SC. All in all an adequate book that will serve until something better is written."
5,A good product,"I bought this after hearing about it by word of mouth. I have a kitten that has been peeing all over the house on blankets and such, and wanted something to get the odors out to keep her from coming back and keep my stuff smelling good as new!This stuff works.32oz concentrate goes a long way. I added it to my laundry cycle to wash blankets/comforters and it works great... all odor was removed from my stuff. Spraying it in the air near a litter box eliminates the odor. Spraying it on my dog's smelly dog bed eliminates that odor. It's a great product.It does have an odd smell... think oranges and pine needles put in a blender.. but that smell goes away after a little bit. It definately neutralizes well and accomplishes what so many other products fail to do: remove over permanently."
4,works ok,"I bought this because I own a convertible car that I left the top down one day and a cat did its ""duty"" on my perforated leather seat. it took a few applications to get rid of the smell but it did eventually leave. im not sure if this product is the only reason that it did though. now we use it for pet odors in the house and it seems to just cover up the smell for a while but it comes back. i also dont like the scent of this stuff either so I dont like using it that often.It seems to work on some stuff but I dont use it enough to really prove it so im giving it the benefit of the doubt because its not expencive and my car does not smell bad any more.MC"
4,Great Stuff,"I had used X-O Neutralozer in the past and was very satisfied. Now that the number of my dogs has increased, the odor has also increased. In spite of baths, there still seems to be doggy odor on my furniture at times. I have used X-O several times and the odor is slowly dissappearing. Wish I had gotten it a little sooner. But, now I have it and I love it. Not the best odor but not to unpleasant. Would buy it again."
5,X-0 is an amazing pet odor and stain cleaner!!!!!!!!!!,"I first tried this when my Great Pyrenees had diarrhea on my friend's carpet on a visit. I wiped up what I could and then poured the X-0 over the stain left in the carpet...several stains....scrubbed with a rag and all of the bowel movement stains were gone and so was the smell!!! I also have an incontinent Akita...and I use this almost everyday on my tile floor at home. This is really the best product for cleaning the worst stains and messes AND SMELLS out of carpets, fabrics, tile floors...I will never be without a bottle!"
5,Fantastic!,"This neutralizer is amazing at getting rid of odors. Our basement is somewhat damp. We have a dehumidifier, but once in a while, it smells musty. A few sprays of X-O, and the odor is gone. It really does work."
5,It really works!,"I didn't want to have anyone over because my house smelled like cat pee! It was so embarrassing! A friend told me about X-O, so I tried it. It actually worked great!! No more bad odors in my house at all! I've already recommended this to several friends with cats. I didn't notice any bad smell after spraying it. If you need to get rid of bad odors, I can't recommend anything better! Buy it!"
2,Disappointed!,"I bought this to remove an appallingly strong perfume odor on an eBay jacket, and it flat did not work at all. Had to donate the jacket to Goodwill. Bummer. So don't buy this to remove synthetic odors, cos it won't do the job."
4,An enjoyable album from a truely talented singer,"I just ""discovered"" this artist via Mike & The Mechanics. I saw him performing live at the Royal Albert Hall in London on tour with the Mechanics. An excellent artist with a uniqie R&B;/Soul voice - great personality. They played his solo album hit single ""Cuddly Toy"" and this got me curious to visit his recent albums. This album is just that place to begin. Great tracks that will continue to spin around in your car stereo system.I recommend this CD to all those who love good rhythms and lots of soul."
4,More than decent recording,"I don't understand the comment by one reviewer on the poor quality of the recording...it's quite decent although it's true that the volume of the mandolin is a bit high...; I also have recordings by I Solisti Veneti, yes very good, but I don't think that they've recorded the same works anyway ; the big advantage of this CD is definitely the selection of concertos and sonatas."
1,Agree with Paul Medina,"I would suggest to Mr. Medina that Claudio Scimone conducting I Solisti Veneti is the best rendering of Vivaldi's mandolin concertos. Actually, I prefer that conductor and ensemble for any of the Red Priest's compositions. There is one old recording Scimone and I Solisti Veneti made about 20 years ago which included the violin concerto discordato that hasn't been matched by any other ensemble or conductor since."
5,I would give it 6 stars.....,"...if that was possible. Can't believe the one crybaby who lowballed this recording. Spectacular, moving, inspiring musicianship."
3,double trouble 7 yr olds,This game is mostly about competition. My kids wanted to be able to do more with the horses. I guess they aren't into the racing as much. If you like competition than you might like this game. My kids haven't played it for quite awhile now.
3,"Umm...REALLY FUN, at first... then it got a little boring...","When i first got the game i was addicted to it for like a week at tops. I hav'nt played the game since. It is really easy to beet the levels and it takes like 2 hours. After that, you just have to play the same levels over and over. I recomend that you dont buy this game unless you like easy, noncompetive (i dont know how to spell that) games."
3,review of ps2 game order,"ITS A CUTE LITTLE GAME BUT ANNOYING TO HAVE TO FEED, WATER, AND WASH THE HORSE SO OFTEN. YOU DONT HAVE TO DO THAT AS OFTEN WITH A REAL HORSE. AND I DONT CARE FOR THE WAYS THE CONTROLS WORK ON THE HORSE. CONFUSING. I PLAYED IT FOR AN HOUR. DONT SEE MYSELF USING IT AGAIN."
3,Is it worth to BUY or a TOTAL waste,"Silver Buckle Stables was fun and a great game-at first.It can be a fun way to learn compotitions but can get boring at some point.I used to play it non-stop but then I got bored with it.The graphics are really good but what do you do when you finish or win all your buckles?You start a new game ho rah. Im young and so is my sister and we both agree that is a really good way to learn and stuff-like you feed,water,mount,dismount,or walk,gallop,canter,and trot but is it worth spending $41 on it in play station form?I say it's a one up one down thumb situation."
1,Doesn't work.,"I ordered this in either good or acceptable condition (can't remember which) but it wasn't. It doesn't work at all. The other games I ordered play well, but this one doesn't. Maybe too many scratches on it?"
3,Good food but messy,"My kitty has an issue throwing up after eating so i hoped this food would curb that issue. I will say that he does throw up less, but not much. the real issue with the food though is that when our cats eat it, it makes a huge mess. Something about the food sort of explodes as they crunch into it. Not sure why, but we're always having to clean up now around their food dish."
2,Drywall Yes ---Deck NO!,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said ""Drywall and Deck"" Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
4,Worked great!,"Purchased as a re-conditioned product. Worked well on my 20X40 basement drywall project. If I had a redo, I would have purchased an automatic screw feed. Took forever to place each screw!"
4,screw gun,This was a re-conditioned product. It is strong and easy to use. I will get more of these in the future.
3,Dewalt is good but,Dewalt is good but why does Amazon have to bait us and mislead by its claim of a higher retail price of 189.00. It sells everywhere at no more than 99.00
3,drywall screwdriver (corded),"This appears to be a v. good driver, except the manual is very poorly written and the illustration insufficiently informative. In addition, the plastic sleeve that adjusts the depth of the screw was so tightly screwed on that I has to mount the driver in my vise and use a wrench to unscrew it. Once this was accomplished the driver works as expected. The manual would not even be required, except the overly foreceful assembly as indicated above made me doubt if I understand the function of the parts."
5,Why did I wait so long?,"For a D.I.Y.er, whose only worked in his own home, I've done a lot of sheetrocking. Now that I'm on my ""final"" project, I finally bought a real screwgun, instead of using a battery drill. All I can say is why did I wait so long? Drives screws instantly, to the correct depth (after adjustment), with almost no noticeable torque against your wrist. Great tool."
3,OK Game,"I've been a Hello Kitty fan for years and I've owned all her games. They're never the best but worth a try, same with this one. The ""mini games"" are the best part of the game. The rest is too slow and boring. The directions aren't very clear.I'm an adult, so I'm not as easily entertained as I may have been if I were younger. I realize that's the target market for this game, but adults like to play games with characters they like also. So, it's good for young kids but not really for anyone else, unfortunately."
2,Goodbye Kitty,"This game is ok. The party planning is hard to figure out for my daughter and for me, we haven't thrown a succesful party yet. The games outside of the prty planning are enjoyable. Would not buy this again."
5,A great video game for girls!,"This is the perfect game for a little girl! We bought this for our 6 yr. old daughter and she finds it fun, challenging and cute!I do feel that I should mention that she completed 5 of the 6 levels in less than a month and didn't play the game for more than an hour a day. She has however, had a lot of video game experience with Playstation 2, Nintendo Gamecube and DS platforms so her level of experience might have encouraged that!The mini-games are delightful and she loves to dress up Hello-Kitty and check on the character's happiness meters and make them ""100% happy"".This game is very entertaining, sweet and completely innocent. One of the few girly games around worth purchasing!"
2,Lefthandedness and asymmetry,"The subtitle of this book is much more accurate than the title. It's not about left-handers so much as a quest into why lefthandedness (or handedness at all, for that matter) occurs. As such, it delves into asymmetries throughout nature, delving as far down as the nonconservation of parity in K-mesons, not to mention the ""handedness"" of amino acids. Only toward the end does it address more relevant issues like brain structure, coming up with some interesting information about differences among right-handers, hooked left-handers, and nonhooked left-handers (""hooked"" referring to how the left-handers bend their hands to write).It's really just an okay book: some interesting information, not particularly well-written or well-organized."
2,boring,"""Lefties"" is one of those books that the bookstores place in racks near the checkout counter, hoping that you'll buy it as an afterthought. If you saw the cover, you might think that it was a humorous and lighthearted look at the phenomenon of left-handedness. However, the vast majority of this book is not even slightly amusing. Unfortunately, Jack Fincher isn't very good at explaining complicated concepts in layman's terms, and he doesn't really try to make ""Lefties"" very entertaining. The body of the book is dedicated to a scientific explanation of what causes some people to be left-handed, and it strays into such fields as particle physics, molecular biology, and neuroscience. I suppose that some people might like that sort of thing, but to me it was about as enjoyable as a high school chemistry textbook."
5,A FUEGO!,"Este cd es la mejor produccion de Mayombe. Me Gustas fue escrito por Oscar Serrano del Grupo Mania. La nena es un buen tema arreglado por el mismo Freddie Mendez. Quiere Bailar Conmigo fue escrito por Juan Luis Guzman(cantante de Blanoc & Negro). El mejor tema en este CD es Solito Me Dejo(escrito por Elvis Crepo). No te pierdas este CD! Tambien recomiendo : Mayombe - Unity, Alto Voltaje - Alto Voltaje 2000, y Mambo - Diferente."
5,Very stylish!,This bar has a great retro look! The stools (sold separate) complete the look and make it a fun set up to serve drinks to company!
3,Not impressed.,"I first must say I could be biased with this review as I have only read the first chapter. I bought this book as it was a requirement for a class I had to take. What I could say after reading the first several pages was this was poorly written. I'm not criticizing the content, but the writing. Everything is too choppy, making it very difficult for to read. Very poor flow of words. Some grammatical errors as well."
2,"looks good from far, not so much from up close...","So I've been eyeing this watch for a while and wife got it for me as a gift.We ended up returning it.I saw this on somebody and it looked real good. The picture looks good too. HOWEVER, once you get a close look, you'll realize how small the diamonds are. And the whole watch itself looks a bit like a toy....just not quality like some of the more expensive ones....granted, the price point is what it is. But you can buy a Movado and other such watches that are 1 or 2 tiers higher than a Bulova for a hundred or 150 more.Again, the watch does look good from afar. I do have another Bulova that I like and others do as well. So not knocking the brand itself but that one also has diamonds in place of numbers but they are also very tiny with shiny square metal piece underneath to make it look bigger. I think this is what all lower tier watch makers do."
2,bulova 96 E 04,I bought a new watch from Amazon but I returned it because the watch had lots scratch on bracelet. I ordered thtee times but everything had scratches. I am so disappointment about amazon. Please check product before shipping to customers in order not to spend their time.
5,"Nice, classy watch!",I had high expectations (because of all the great reviews) when I ordered this watch. I was very happy when I got the watch in the mail. It is a very elegant looking watch with some flash (but not too flashy). I am very happy with my purchase - by far the best watch I have ever bought and even better considering the low price (compared to retail stores) that I paid for it on Amazon.
3,simple renditions,"I only have heard a few of the songs on this CD, and not before this winter. It is possible for studio musicians to produce powerful, polished masterpieces, only to find that when they are facing a crowd, it is easier to put on an acoustic show and let the bass player sit in the audience, as during the introduction of the band during an interview contained on this CD. When I saw Timbuk 3 at The Fine Line in Minneapolis, it was only two of them, after they had been recording with four in the band, and they only sang one song from their Sample the Dog days, but I was ready to appreciate what I could absorb. Big Star sounds to me like it is just about up to that level of entertainment in this performance."
4,Grandson loved it,"My Grandson had a plastic cell phone which broke, my daughter then gave him an old phone of hers and while playing with it he dialed 911, much to his surprise someone answered. He got scared and told his Mom he didn't want the phone anymore. Grandma to the rescue. I found this phone on your website and because my grandsons live in another state it makes it very easy to send them a surprise once in a while. Thanks and Reid thanks you too."
1,Not Worth The Money,I purchased this video in hopes of learning a few ways of accurizing the AR15. This video did not cover this subject in detail what so ever. In fact the entire video was quite shallow. At $41.00 this is a waste of money.The only person who may benefit from this would be a novice. I would advise against purchasing the video ifyou are looking for more in depth information.
1,"Wrong Reviews For Public Domain Episodes of ""The Lucy Show""","The reviews for ""The Lucy Show"" are incorrect. The reviews are for ""I Love Lucy"" season five. People who read the reviews and order the product will be expecting ""I Love Lucy."" Unfortunately, the product they will receive are the horrible (poor quality) public domain episodes of the classic ""Lucy Show"" series. All public domain episodes should be boycotted since now CBS/Paramount Home Video are releasing official season releases of ""The Lucy Show."" Season three due out November 30th. People should just wait for each official season release otherwise people are going to be severely disappointed by the quality of the picture and the quality of the sound. Be patient Lucy fans, season four will be released on March 15th, 201l. We will then just have two seasons left of ""The Lucy Show"" to be released."
1,Eight of nine are instrumentals,"I am always looking for a funky Rock and Roll or Rockabilly Christmas album. Cut number one fits the bill, but the next eight cuts are instrumental. I suggest the compilation ""Rockabilly Christmas"" or the ""Hot Rods-Christmas"" if you'd like something other than instrumentals."
2,Meh,"There is nothing special about this product. It doesn't really mask the smell of cat urine. However, it does not produce a nasty smell that some products do after being mixed with the amonia smell. If you are hoping that this odor neutralizer will get rid of the smell so your cat will not urinate on the furniture then don't buy it. My cat just kept coming back. I had to buy a new couch. There hasn't been a problem with the new couch yet."
4,Good product,"I get migraines from fragrances, so I'm always looking for something I can use to eliminate odors without replacing them with a worse one. This is the one that works for me. We have a dog, so I occasionally spray it on his bed. There is a slight fragrance when first sprayed, but that quickly goes away, along with the odor. I've also used it in the bathroom and under the kitchen sink, where my garbage can is. I would recommend this product."
5,It works!,"We had a terrible odor in an office kitchen cabinet (drainage problem). Nothing got rid of it. I'm happy to report that the problem is now eliminated. This product does have a scent when first used but it does go away. And with it goes the previous odor. This product is far superior to any of the ""grocery store"" products I've tried."
2,Not for older persons,This Bible listed as large print is the same print as older Holman Christian Standard study Bible purchased earlier when large print was unavailable. Print is dim and not easy to read for older persons. If you are looking for a large print easy to read Bible in my opinion this is not the one for you.
3,This book is only OK,"This book is OK. Its not a very good book as an introduction in my opinion. If you are a new student to DSP I would steer clear of this book and get Oppenheim & Schafer or Proakis & Manolakis first. However, if you are looking for practical coding examples for things, this book is VERY good in that regard. It could be useful to the new student as an alternate reference."
4,Outstanding DSP book.,This book helped me to implement the theory behind DSP. This is a perfect book that you can learn by doing.
1,The worst book on the subject,If you want to learn DSP. I suggest Oppenheim or Proakis.I bought this book and after going through it for a few weeks had to throw it away!. Lacks mathematical clarity. Looks more like a cook book to me !.Don't waste your money!.
4,Don't Let the Negative Reviews Sway You,"I almost let the negative reviews sway me from buying this CD. This is every bit as good and haunting, in some ways, as the first Sweetback CD. As one reviewer said, you have to keep an open mind. Matthewman, Hale and Denman never put out crap. Different doesn't mean that it is bad. In some ways I find this CD better than the first. Keep in mind that they are stepping away from the Sade band and doing something different. If you want Sade, then wait on the next CD-whenever that will be!"
3,"Good, but not a classic","Although Stage 2 is not better than the 1st CD, it's still a decent CD. If you're looking for ""vintage sweetback"", don't look here. In my personal opinion, Aya on the vocals is just as good as Amel (if not better on some tracks). To be honest, I thought she was Amel till I looked at the credits!!!! The apparent deviation from the trio's old style can either be appreciated or looked down upon. Altough not worth an 8 year wait, Stage 2 is still pretty good."
5,A step in the left direction,"AMAZING!! I wondered what these guys would sound like after an 8 year break. It is very different from the 1st CD (which I love).It is more song based this time round ,with a more edgy production. My favorites so far are Lover,Circles and Love is the Word (Which sounds like the song from Grease!).The playing is amazing as usuall and Aya and Chocolate Genius fit right in."
4,Must have open mind!!!,I bought this CD and didnt listen to if for a year after I listened the first time. I initially didnt like it because like everyone else I was looking for a remake of the first CD but after a second listen I'm beginning to appreciate the CD and the musical talents of Sweetback. After listening again I got past the fact that this is not the original jazz/neo-soul of the first CD but good quality music none the less.After torturing my ears with the new wave of brittany spears/ 98 degrees sound of R&B; ie Chris Brown & Neo(sp) I decided to revisit my Cd collection and I gave this one another try. I'm glad I did!!!!!!!
1,Sade?.... Can't we just all get along?!...,"Sweetback-The first album was awesome! Simply put, she (Sade) must have cried like a baby when she heard this one. This album, (2nd)ah?....? Na, crash-N-burn... In short, they should have come to terms and stayed together. They rock when they are together, and Sade is complimented perfectly when she and the band play. Simply awesome!........"
2,Second Sweetback,"Not as good as their first. This albums has a darker urban feeling, like the corners of New York or New Orleans. Their first album is the best, and I love these guys no matter what. They are Sade's heartbeat externalized."
5,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sweetback's new album is a classic, rivaling the best work the band has done with Sade in the past. My favorite song is Lover, a haunting R&B/soul number. The whole album is strong and the musicianship stirring. The vocal on Master's Love is quite unique and the loop is hypnotic. All in all, ""The 2nd Stage"" is a must have for me and any Sade Lover's Rock fan."
2,Did Sweetback really have to release this album ?,"As an admirer of their first album, I am quite disappointed with (most of) the songs as well as the production (in general) of Sweetback' s follow-up album. The tracks I enjoyed are so similar to the ones in their first album that it is difficult to call them as ""new material"". Sweetback will no longer be in my watch list anymore."
4,Surprised by the negative reviews,"I'm very surprised by the negative reviews. I've owned thistoothbrush for about 3 years now--I got it when I got braces. Itworked great then, and it continues to work great. I've never hada problem with the brush heads snapping off (are you putting alot of pressure on it? You shouldn't need to.), nor with bristlescoming off while I am using it (I find it very hard to believeanyone is having a recurring problem like this). I've never had asingle problem with this product, and think it is one of the bestTV infomercial products I have ever seen. I live in fear that Iwill have to go back to a manual toothbrush."
1,Flawed design,"We are on our second package of replacement brushes for the Cybersonic 2, and they tend to fall off their base. One of the brushes lost its bristles as it was used."
2,Not item pictured in photo,"I really like Little Twig products- they are natural products made in the USA. I needed to have a baby gift shipped quickly and came across this listing. The photo shows 3 products (baby wash, lotion and powder), a cute washcloth and a sponge in a nicely wrapped bag. The actual product is a box full of 3 bubble baths and nothing else! They weren't even baby body washes, but all bubble baths- which I would not recommend using on a baby- maybe a toddler or a child."
5,Family Favorite,"I do not typically write reviews, yet I thought it important to share that our family enjoys this game--from my 8-month old that likes to play with the tokens to my 3-year-old and 5-year-old that love playing the game. They can call out the animals and help each other find the match on the cards. Trick is getting them to put it away when they are done, as it is with anything else with which they play..."
2,??????,i bought a game almost like this one for my 2 year old.for her b-d this summer. it said 3+up.she like the game.it had farm animals on it. got it used.it was all made out of cardboard. if you have a little one who chows things still. i would wait tell they our over 3 years old to play animal bingo.if you can find plastic amimal bingo if they make it. it will be better.but if i was to bought this new and cheap. i will put it away tell they stop chewing. you will waste money in the chowing stage. i know half the game is no good she mess it up by ripping it up or marking it up or chewing it and eating it.better wait tell they stop chewing to play this game or any game is cardboard. do not buy tell the child is not chewing thing up. you will waste money....
3,Not bad but somewhat lacking,"I'm definitely a fan of Steve Roach, but this collaboration with Vidna Obmana had me somewhat disappointed. You sort of get the feeling that something is missing. Steve Roach has certainly released some fantastic music over the past twenty or so years, so a few not so great releases are forgiveable. ""Innerzone"" isn't a bad cd--it does have a few interesting moments, as anything from Steve Roach does. I guess the best way I can describe this release is a subtle build up of suspense that doesn't really have a punchline."
1,Never Received This DVD,"Unfortunately, I have yet to view this movie as I never received it. MediaThrill did respond to my inquiry email and are in the process of refunding my purchase price."
3,"Hey, was that a red stop sign I saw?","What I find surprising is with all the great care given to certain detail, there is always some evidence that someone neglest to do their homework. Two examples apply directly, that stop signs were yellow until about 1958, and Rod Steiger should surely have known that the US Army never had a ""Brig"". On a logical point, why were not aero planes used as spotters? Otherwise, the movie is entertaining enough, with a moral point, and the acting was well."
2,In Pursuit of Honor falters and then Flops,"In Pursuit of Honor is a charade. Billed as a true story it isn't as the producer and writer later admitted. The costumes and props were semi-accurate. The horse furniture, weapons and personal equipment of the horse soldiers were right on with a couple of glaring exceptions. In 1935 enlisted men did not wear orniments on their campaign hats in the field and neither did officers. Those used in the film were grossly incorrect for any period. In 1935 EM wore knee length laced (engineer) boots with flexible uppers. The collar brass was too small, etc."
3,Well Done!,"In ""Pursuit of Honor"" Don Johnson does a very credible job as an aging army sergeant, Sgt Libby, in the US cavalry in the mid-1930s, a time when the nation was changing over the cavalry to tanks. Though the movie purports to be based on real events, the only real event is that the US Army did indeed destroy its horses. This story is just one of those ideas about ""what might have happened..."" Johnson is convincing as a rough-and-tumble character with an excellent cast around him. He shows no sign of his Miami Vice good looks. See the movie more for what it shows honor to really mean, rather than any of the pretty good action it shows. Honor has a price and Sgt Libby and his fellow soldiers are willing to pay it."
4,Old Cav',As a cavalry soldier....I found this movie to be very interesting to see a part of our history. As a horse lover I was moved at the dedication of these troopers. I would have rode with them! A peek back in time...nice.
5,Inspiring Tale (small spoiler alert included),"I found this movie to be well-done and inspiring in content. On the whole, the characters were believable and genuine. Don Johnson shines in this film as a character whose integrity does not always get the best personal results, but you find yourself totally liking this person. Rod Steiger could have stayed home for this one - he was so wooden and half-hearted (even down to wearing a ridiculous medallion that was totally out of context) that I literally cringed every time he came on the screen. The rest of the cast were also very good and fit well into the storyline. I thoroughly enjoyed this film (although the scene where they shoot the first batch of horses is very hard to stomach) and have watched it many times. Excellent!"
1,"Not just bad, but a lie!!!","Let me preface my comments by saying that I am a cavalry historian and have published a book on the U.S. Cavalry (check Amazon if you don't believe me). This movie is absolutely and completely wrong!1) Cavalry horses were never disposed of by machine-gunning them - either they were humanely put down or sold.2) No one ever stole cavalry horses to prevent them from being shot and then took them to Canada.3) The U.S. Cavalry Association, an organization composed of cavalry veterans, attempted to sue the filmmakers for slander over this film. They couldn't though, because their organization had not itself been slandered.4) There are numerous other smaller historical inaccuracies that I don't have the energy to mention, but other reviewers already have.Don't waste your time!!!"
1,The Film is a Fallacy,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but my curiosity was aroused because at the end of this supposed ""based on a true story"" movie, it does not tell you what happens to the characters in the story. After extensive research and speaking with the US Cavalry Association and the MacArthur Foundation this story proved to be a LIE. The US mounted Cavalry was not retired until the 1950s. This event never happened and HBO should apologize to their viewers for a blatant lie..."
5,In Pursuit of Honor,"My husband had seen this movie a long time ago and asked me to see if I could find it online. I found it on Amazon and I ordered it on Monday and it arrived in the mail on Friday. This is a movie that will always be in my library, after I loan it to our grandchildren."
5,In pursuit of Honor,The DVD was exactly as advertised and arrived just a few days after placing the order. I will order from this seller again.
4,I thought the story was very touching.,The movie itself starts off very slow but the wait is well worth it for the ending.
4,Purely fiction,"Great movie, with good acting! Just don't believe that it was based upon a true story. Rather, there are no facts to back it up and, thus, this movie is pure fiction. The movie is properly entitled, ""In Pursuit of Honor"". However, I wouldn't go as far to say that this applies to the writer."
4,In Pursuit of Honor,"I thought this movie was very well done. The historical story, which everyone should be aware of, was a real eyeopener. The acting was very well done and the scenery was beautiful. I would have liked to have known what happened to the people involved in this so called mutiny at the end of the movie though."
4,A butch tearjerker,"What's not to like? Horses, soldiers, evil generals and idealistic young officers, crusty salt-of-the-earth seargents, plucky women, escape and pursuit, sadness, victory and oodles of male bonding. Don Johnson and the underestimated Craig Sheffer do a nice job."
3,They didn't get the Bonus Marches right either......,"They didn't get the Bonus Marches right in the movie. MacArthur offered tents and rolling kitchen meals for vets, but Congress didn't want the vets to have 3 meals a day during the protest, while 8 million people in US were out of work and needed food as well. FDR offered free transportation to N Y vets to return home. The president offered the rest of vets the same. Most vets left at that point. The Communist Party planned a riot in order to provoke a gov. attack on protesters. FBI fingerprinted a thousand criminals taking part in protest. The cavalry was called in and did not use swords or guns. They used teargas!In 1948, the Communist Party revealed through publications their part in the march. Several communist party leaders were rounded up at the time.The rest of the movie, although entertaining, was PURE FICTION!"
3,Purchase for somebody else.,The person I purchased this for was happy with it... so I am okay with it if they are I guess.
4,A great drill but I chose the Milwaukee 0302-20.,Length:: 2:48 MinsI bought the Milwaukee 0302-20 and compared it to this drill. The Milwaukee 0302-20 had a few more features that I liked. They both felt the same as far as ergonomics. Check out the video for the details.
3,Teaches WSAD but you need a lot of,"""patience""This was my first book on WSAD. I liked the step by step instructions.It teaches how to use WSAD to build web apps. However, there are too many bugs in the step by step instructions. Like others mentioned you can not skip chapters that are not of importance to you as the project is build over most of the chapters.If you can find oher books, better not to buy this one.Overall this book teaches WSAD. however, you need lot of patience to understand the buggy instrctions."
2,Horrible Book!!!,I bought this book based on the 5 star rating and I now understand that it must be books author who provided that review. If you use this book to learn WSAD you will lose your job. You've been warned. If you don't beleive me I have a used copy that I'm willing to part with.
1,Don't Risk Your Job on this Book,Code examples not very helpful. Little help when it comes to running test server or Websphere MQ integration. Five star reviewer is clearly friend of the author or the author himself.
4,Excellent album,"Ranging from Japanese and Hindi country music to middle-eastern rock, this CD is full of great tracks. The main emphasis is on middle-eastern music. Great playing from everyone. The country influenced tracks were a bit of novelty though (includes Soba Song and This City is Very Exciting), could do without them, but I guess it's all just for fun. My favorites include the opening track (good vocals), Zohar No 2 (apparently klezmer influenced with some strange synth in the background) and Ya Habibi, Ya Ghaybine (with some very well arranged guitar and horns).3 Mustaphas 3 creates a strange mix of music for those who want something new, and especially if you enjoy world music. I actually find this music easy to do work to. It has a nice familiar feel somehow. It has convinced to go after more 3 Mustaphas 3 CDs. Try it, you may like it."
3,Great ambience; mediocre inspiration,"The author lovingly depicts the relentlessly grim details of daily life in an unnamed totalitarian regime immediately after WWII, centering on a homicide investigation. However, the essential plot elements (the lone, misunderstood hero; a few obligatory beatings or other savageries; the beautiful rich woman in distress; the usual degeneracy and cover-ups in high places; etc.) are borrowed from any number of American detective novels or films noirs. (Hmm. Never had to use that last one in the plural before.) The characterization was not compelling.I read this hoping I would move on to and enjoy the successor novels in the series. Perhaps I will return to them someday, and perhaps I just had unrealistic expectations, but I have to say that, beneath the very skillful ostmitteleuropaeisch veneer, this had an all too familiar feel to it."
5,"For no special reason, I very much enjoy Steinhauer's books...","I wish I could be more specific or precise in my critique of his writing, but I cannot. I read ""The Tourist"" first by chance and motored through, enjoying every element. Same with this book. His writing is clear and clean. The characters are well drawn in only a few strokes. The plot sustains the tension - one feels as if he is standing at the protagonist's shoulder. The bleakness of the Communist bloc countries comes through every sentence along with the proletarian dreams and miseries - the hope for a new and better workers' world and the realities of the corrupt officials and government permeate the novel. Not much more than a police procedural, but so well done that it transcends the genre. Look forward to the next in the Brod series. For those who enjoy the various Swedish whodunits, this book will be a great read."
3,Cold War Murder in Eastern Europe,"A not altogether convincing murder mystery set in an unnamed Eastern block nation shortly after WW II. Our hero is the new guy in the pricinct, who lives with mom and dad. A thorough nebish, who, by the end, solves the crime, earns the respect of his hostile comrades, defeats powerful antagonists and gets the girl. So she's over the hill and an alcoholic. It's still a victory. I wonder if they move in with his folks? The narrator is excellent, though the tale is flawed. He has an attractive voice, and makes a brave stab at portraying the transition of our hero from schlepper to mensch."
2,Nice ideas,"about how to get your horse to actually *want* to do what you are asking of him. This book stresses humane, painless, fearless and fair interaction between horse and human. However, there are two things that bother me greatly about this book. First, the style of the writer makes this book more of an ego-trip than anything else (one can only say that many times someone is great and unbelievable). Second, as far as I know, the methods discussed in this book are largely from Monty Roberts, not from Richard Maxwell, and the latter seems to take all credit."
3,"""Where's Max?""","I really did not like reading a book that was so much in 2nd person, there was some really good information in the book, but I grew weary of hearing Lesley's say ""Max finds"" ""Max then sends"" ""Max is asking"" and would of liked to hear Max explain the how and why for himself."
5,Wonderful,"For those of you who like acapella choral sounds, this is the best. Nobody does it better than Derric Johnson. His arrangements are classy, fun, clever and creative. A terrific CD."
1,Disappointing,"I knew Staedtler was a good brand so I decided to make this purchase but when I got it everything seemed very cheap. The plastic parts were covered in scratches and there was excess plastic covering the ruler making it hard to read accurate measurements. It looked like the set was used and repackaged as new. Every piece in the set is very low quality, I would advise you to pick up a better set."
2,"Terrible Sound Quality, Questionable Track Choices!","I guess I only have myself to blame for not doing enough research before getting this but the reason why I went for this and not the more popular remastered ""Hits"" is because I really wanted ""Keep the Fire Burning"" which for some reason is not there. I could live with the track selections that do leave out quite a lot of better tracks that are found on the ""Hits"" package but the poor sound quality is what really gets me. Definitely a misnomer as this is certainly not the best of REO either in track selections or in sound quality."
3,"A better than your ""average"" compilation","This compilation really did go through ALL of REO Speedwagon's records. It is not just the 1980's through 1995 years here. For someone who is just being introduced to REO you will hear the transformation from a ""Country"" sounding band in the early 70's, to what we all know and love, the arena rock band. Pick this one up if you're looking for all the favorites, with a touch of their old stuff."
1,Unimpressive,"The level of detail and generality would make this book suitable for a lower-level undergrad course on urban planning or urban geography. However, even as someone who has completed an advanced degree, I found this book to be extremely difficult to follow. The topics covered are good; the photographs are well done. But the text itself is hard to understand. The logic of the author's argumentation is faulty in some places. Several diagrams left me clueless because there was not enough supporting documentation to interpret them. On the bright side, I did like his suggested portfolio assignments at the end of every chapter. If you can find a better book for your course, use it. Otherwise, this one will have to do."
3,A mixed bag,"Book was in good condition, more or less as reflected in the price. However, it took a week and a half to arrive. My previous mail experience with Amazon book sellers has been much better -- none have taken more than 5 days for delivery."
5,Fun for many months!,My baby got this toy when she was 4 months old and used it until she started to crawl at about 8 months. It works well in both modes. She really likes to spin the part under the mirror. When she got big enough to kick and grab the butterflies she would often kick the whole thing over but she never hurt herself on it. Definitely one of her most used toys!
4,Great Toy,"We have been playing this toy for my daughter since we brought her home, she is now 5 1/2 weeks old and still loves the sound, now she sees light too, so she looks at the lights. Once she gets older she will start kicking the hanging toys, for now, her feet don't reach. Love the mode where you just keep the music on, that way she's occupied while i throw her diaper away. We did have to add batteries just last week, mind you we used it everyday at every awakening for 5 1/2 weeks."
4,My two month old loves this!,"My ten week old daughter gets very excited when it lights up and the music starts to play. She even tries to bat at the butterfly and bee to get the music going. Only one problem, when on her tummy she tries to roll over onto her back and she keeps hitting her head on the hard plastic legs. It's not enough to hurt her but she gets very mad."
5,A MUST HAVE!,This was given to us as a gift. I would have never picked it out myself. It is the best toy we have! Our 3 month old LOVES it. It's a life saver as it gives me longer breaks and he really enjoys batting at the two hanging items. There are two modes of play (short and long) and they both work great - we choose accordingly depending upon his mood. I really can't say enough about this toy - it's great! We haven't yet used it for tummy time ... stay tuned.
5,Tummy Time Solution,"My 4 month old HATES tummy time, so when I saw this--I thought, we might as well give it a try. He stays on his tummy much longer now thanks to the Tummy Time Gym. He seems to like the mirror when its in tummy time mode... and the music more when he's on his back. Don't forget about the back mode. My son will sit there for 15 minutes just listening to the music, watching the lights, and kicking. Great product--wish more products converted for tummy time."
4,The Songs...and not the Music...,"When this album is good, it is really good, and when it is ok, it is OK. Hunter's version of Box of Rain and Scarlet Begonias are not as musically complex as those of the Grateful Dead, but when Hunter sings, you know that he is singing his songs, and that only he knows exactly what these songs are about.... This is folk music in an older sense, and it is good. When the Grateful Dead recorded and performed Hunter's lyrics, it was more as a conduit to their musical vision. When Hunter performs these songs, howver, he is recreating the song as he initially imagined them. He is singing about what he knows and has experienced."
3,Straining for Simplicity,"I'd like to like Rob Hunter's effort here a lot more than I do, but it does seem he'll be better remembered as the Dead's lyricist. A friend accompanied me to a concert in Cincinnati way back in 1979, and the stark 'revisiting' of that evening is pretty much conjured by this CD. By that read limited musicianship and vocals, and not a great deal of charisma that might hold a crowd. The songwriting skills are not half what Deadheads might claim for them. The best stuff on the individual solo work represented here comes from,'Rumrunners', but I don't think that adds up to a little more than half an album's worth of pleasant acoustic folk."
2,Still don't like it,"I pull this CD out every once in awhile to listen to it, but I still don't really like it. I respect Hunter as a writer, but no matter how much I listen to the CD, I still find it hard to listen to. Not being a great singer never bothered me, I've always been a fan of Dylan and Neil Young (not great singing voices never got in their way), but Hunter's voice has always grated on me.Oh well, some people get certain things, while others don't. I'm sure there are a lot of music I listen to that other people don't enjoy, either."
2,For me: not interesting at all,"At the time of the first publishing this may have been a good sock book, but it is no longer. I didn't realize this is a book on short-row heels only! Since this style does not fit my or any other person's feet I knit for, and directions for this style can be found everywhere (books, internet) I sent this book back, being deeply disappointed. If it had some interesting patterns with photos I might have kept it, but just drawings put me off even more. I'd recommend you look for other sock books if you want nice patterns, and if you need instructions on short row heels you should look up the Internet - you'll find lots and lots of variations."
3,Specific technique,"Simple Socks is a compendium of knitting and sizing techniques that the author has selected as her favorites, after years of study and experimentation. I've been knitting socks for years, so can't be certain, but it seems that this would be a good how-to manual for beginners, and also for knitters who want to design their own patterns. Adapting existing patterns that recommend other techniques to Gibson-Roberts' methods would be more time consuming than useful, IMO."
2,"A good technical reference, but . . .","the particulars don't work. The sizing (and formula for sizing) in this book don't work for me at all. Every time I've tried to use Gibson-Roberts's formula, I've ended up with enormous socks that needed to be ripped out--one was sixteen inches in circumference. The directions for the short row technique themselves do work, but the pen and ink illustrations aren't very good. I'd recommend a more general knitting book with a chapter on socks, since the short row technique needs no more than a page or two to be explained."
5,Great Guide for a Newbie Sock Knitter!!,"This is an indispensable guide for knitting socks that fit great! I had been wanting to learn to knit socks for a while now, but was unable to make the class offered by my local yarn shop, so I picked up this wonderful guide instead! I am thrilled with the results. In addition to the basic sock-knitting instructions, the author offers great tips to make better-fitting socks, such as using a larger size needle on the ribbing portion of the sock.Gibson-Roberts gives a method to knit a sock to fit any foot, based on just two foot measurements. I felt that the illustrations in the book were really helpful to learning the special heel and toe shaping techniques. Also, she explains how to knit the socks from either top-to-toe ( which is the method I used for my first pair) or from toe-to-top. Rather than purchasing a bunch of sock patterns, I would recommend picking up this book and letting your creativity run wild!"
3,"Beautiful socks, but...","I've been trying to find a method for making socks that actually looks like the socks that you can buy in a store (no weird heel gusset), and this book is it. The socks turn out beautiful and they look ""normal.""---BUT---I'm an engineer, and I am usually really good at figuring things out from a written description.I had a really tough time with this book. The instructions left me scratching my head, and the illustrations are rough hand sketched drawings that just aren't thorough enough. You're left wondering which drawing goes with which instruction AND why what you are knitting doesn't match the drawing."
3,poor sound quality,"I ordered this to use for Spanish language study, and it would have been great, but the sound quality is so poor that it is has limited usefulness as a language learning tool. When it was dubbed, the music track was set at a much higher volume than the narration, so you see the animated story and hear the music but the Spanish narration is barely audible. Additionally, given that these are stories for small kids, the language should be slow and easy to follow, but because the wordy storytelling has to keep up with the animated story, the narrator rattles off the story at a pace too fast for children (or language learners)to keep up with. It is a very worthy project that could have been better executed. Given the very reasonable price, it still may be of interest to some people. The 1970's artistic style is unique and interesting."
2,Potted history of Wings.,"This book really provides an overview of Wings' career. But it feels to me a little disjointed, like it is really just a lot of anecdotes and stories cobbled together from other sources, rather than a complete uniform work in it's own right. I also find some of the writing a little clumsy in it's phrasing and wording. That said it is an entertaining enough read for a night but I can't say that I learned anything new here.The album and singles sections in the back are good to have though. There are some photos of rare Wings material throughout the book which are interesting, but it would have been nice to have them printed in colur in a glossy photo section of the book."
2,Band Needs to Run,"I was very disappointed with this book. I love the Beatles and I always enjoy reading about how musicians band together to make music. I had looked forward to reading about this part of McCartney's career that is seldom written about. Although there are many interesting anecdotes, the book is not so much a biography as a list of facts strung together in simple sentences. The author seldom takes the time to go into any detail. I do not recommend."
2,This book was entirely too basic.,"As a first year principal, I was hoping to gain additional insight into the profession. However, what I found was very basic and largely common sense. I have read several books for my post graduate work that were much more helpful. Sorry-it's not worth the read."
5,Best book I've read in awhile !,"After leaving a 20 year career with the government, I was hoping to find something more creative. While looking for information on buying a pet bird for my daughter , I happened across not only a great book about birds but also a new career. Although I will be starting at the hobby level at first , with the straight forward advice and information in this book I really feel I can expand this to any level. This book reflects 25 years of some one elses hard work and experience. Not only did I find the information on raising birds fascinating but there is a wealth of knowledge for anyone looking to start their own business."
3,A Nice Gift,"Judy Reeves has boxed together a book of prompts and practices along with cards that offer advice on the practice of creative writing.This set is a nice gift for anyone who suffers from writer's block or who wants to embark on a career in creative writing. The book offers a year of writing prompts, recommended readings, many quotes from famous writers and several pages of open journal pages that holds all of the inspiration one might receive. The cards offer 25 suggestions for becoming a better writer, from overcoming bad habits to developing new ideas freely.All in all this is a nicely packaged set for a gift to a would-be writer. For serious writers I recommend Reeve's more thorough book on writing, ""A Writer's Book of Days"". But any inspiration is good inspiration!"
1,Have to agree with the previous reviewer,"This is a complete repackaging of ""A Writer's Book of Days"" and the blurbs on the package do NOT warn you. There is no new material at all. If you already have the book, then you have everything the ""kit"" has to offer."
5,kc1346,"i bought this watch last january and just loved it. unfortunately, my pleasure didn't last too long.i've stopped wearing it because ... my wife wore it once and since then she has refused to let me have it back. it looks great on her hand and every time i see her wearing it i feel a longing to have it back. i'm considering buying another one"
4,I know what you're thinking,Let's face it...most of the telepath episodes of B5 are awesome and this one is no exception. It deals with the origins of telepaths and leads Byron and his group to a more aggressive push for a homeworld. Also Londo and G'kar return to Centauri Prime. I believe this is the first time they've been back since they helped to overthrow the government. A great buy.
5,Great escapist fiction,"This is the perfect book for fans of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Tryon takes the reader back to a time when everything was glamourous and there was something almost magical about the movies. But he then proceeds to tell the very REAL behind-the-scenes story of some leading ladies, who share a common thread in that they were all involved with the same man at one time or another.This is the kind of book you can't put down. There's lots of melodrama, intrigue, sex... and even murder! Also some pretty funny twists, especially the first story. (If you read it you'll see what I mean.) Glorious camp! Five stars."
4,A fun Hope Christmas flick,"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this lesser-known Bob Hope Christmas film. Bob Hope plays a shifty race track con man who finds himself with only the few remaining weeks to Christmas to procure the $10,000 he accidentally scammed a mobster out of. The Lemon Drop Kid flees to New York where he rounds up his old friends to help him in a scheme that involves a shelter for old ladies and a lot of sidewalk Santa Clauses.Even when he was playing a lout, Hope was still somehow sweet and loveable. No matter how dirty his deeds, he never crosses a line that you can't forgive, and he always redeems himself in the end.The disc,as was to be expected, was pretty barebones. Unfortuntely, not a lot of effort is put into the releases of these older films unless they're universally-recognized classics like ""Casablanca"". Still, the film is enough fun to get this DVD even without the extras that make the format so worthwhile."
4,A very funny classic,"Great to see this movie again after many years!Classic Bob Hope at his best. The digital restoration of this movies was excellent.My only hope is at some point some company will colorize this movie.The street musical scene where Hope sings ""Silver Bells"" would have looked great in color."
2,MY GRADE: C minus to C.,One of Bob Hope's not so funny flicks. Typically I liked his humor but not this time around. I struggled through it for about 40 minutes. Humor is dated. Fail. WHEN WATCHED: end of November 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C minus to C.
4,Unappreciated Holiday Gem,"This won't be an extensive review, just some thoughts. I never saw ""The Lemon Drop Kid"" in its entirety before and considering how I sat through ""Holiday"" and others, this is one of the funner and funnier holiday films to come from the classic 1940s. Bob Hope plays a horse hustler who in his hustling disses a mob boss.To avoid being a corpse for Christmas, he makes up a scheme to create an old folks (""Old Dolls"") home and with a legal license to collect, gets a bunch of his gang to dress as Santas and collect from shoppers. He did not expect to get a soft spot for the dolls nor that the $10,000 he owes would end up where it does!Co-stars Marilyn Maxwell as the love interest; in real life Hope did have an affair with her, per Wiki. Interesting. I love their chemistry as they sing ""Silver Bells,"" the first film to release this Christmas classic.Overall, fun if a bit dated film of gangsters, Christmas and some classy cars!"
3,Lemon Drop Kid movie,"For some reason, I remember this movie by the song Silent Night. I forgot the real title. However, I loved the movie and of course anything with Bob Hope is a hit."
5,Great,I bought this DVD for my dad during Christmas time because he said he use to watch this show on Christmas with his family when he was a kid. He was very surprised I found the movie and was thrilled that it was just how he remembered it. Very pleased with the product and it is actually a pretty good movie.
2,NOT in color,"Called amazon rep. before purchase who assured me and double checked that this dvd was shown in COLOR. dvd arrived and i was excited,this being one of my favorite Christmas movies, only to be very dissapointed that the dvd, like the vhs version, is in black and white.(except for the dvd cover)."
2,Lacking,"I expected more from a B. Hope movie, but this one delivers a lot less. Fans of Bob will be disapointed."
4,"A funny,good movie for the family, any time of year.","Our family enjoyed watching this movie at Christmas time, but it's great anytime of year. Bob Hope is charming and hilarious as the Lemon-Drop Kid, a Damon-Runyon character who tries to outwit the mob. Listen for the Christmas favorite ""Silver Bells"". Our kids loved it."
3,Hope is ok1,"Bob Hope is ok in this movie. He does his Hope shtick. I am not sure this is really a Christmas movie. The plot is helped along by the season, but seems like any other movie he made. Not one of my Hope favorites."
2,Where Is The Whole Movie,"My copy of the DVD was not too bad, video or Audio. This copy,however has been edited down considerably. There are manyimportant scenes that are missing. Looks like Brentwood foundan old copy in the basement of a TV station somewhere that had been hacked up to accomodate commercials."
4,Old But Valuable,"The Art of Plain Talk was published in 1946, but it's information is timeless. If you are serious about being a better writer, you would be wise to check out this book."
4,It's definitely building up,"I like the idea of releasing the premiere on DVD but I don't know how much money it will make. I don't think I will be buying it but I could see a niche market for it.The first 4 hours of Day 6 didn't have the same level of excitement and action as Day 5, but I get the feeling they are building up to something bigger. Also, there is a shocker at the end of the 4th hour. All in all, it makes me want to watch more of the best show on Network TV."
2,Weakest season yet?,"I just finished watching the first four episodes of 24 and I must admit...it is nowhere near as good as the previous 5 seasons. Four hours into the day I should be fully invested and so far I really could care less. Regina King is awful. She is a legalistic attorney who values civil rights over the lives of citizens. Oh and she happens to be the President's sister. (just when you thought the Kim Bauer type character was gone she comes back an rears her ugly head)! Oh and the only thing that really shocked me is that Jack had to kill someone. Well, usually that isn't a surprise but when you see who it is it will be."
5,fantastic,"I don't review many items but seeing that no one has reviewed Rick Peckham Trio's ""Left End"" is a travisty. This is a great guitarist's guitarists album (CD). I had never heard of Rick Peckham but I'm sure glad I read a review and got this disc. I hope he puts out more stuff or comes to the Bay Area. This disc is playfully improvised jazz played with a hard rock edge. Simple and complex at the same time. The guitar has a nice nasty rock sound and the bass and drums hold down one hellova beat. I expect no less from Jim Black and Tony Scherr. Great work - give me more!"
2,Jazz/Rock Trio.....,"I got interested in Rick Peckham's work after watching the closing performance on Berklee's Instructional DVD: Jazz Guitar Techniques Modal Voicings (it was OK but not so much new info for me). On DVD, Rick was using Boss Loop pedal and improvised over the repeated bass loop figures. It was a little weird but gave me an idea to use the loopie things.So I expected something similar to the DVD but this CD was like rock/blues trio. Anyway, Berklee teachers should perform more on a real world - outside of the conservatory."
3,great game,"I bought this because I had railroad tycoon back in the old days. I thought it was a great game then, but they took a few things out I liked. Oh, well. It also will crash win7 if you get too much going on, still great escape."
4,Beware,I perchased this game from Sold Out Software on 6/15/2011 and it is full of VIRIOUSES so if you by from them BEWARE
3,Girl In Motion,"I'm not a fan of most of the the rockin'/blusey songs on this CD, which makes up the majority of the disc, HOWEVER the album is more than worth getting for the two stand out tracks: ""Valentine"" (with Bruce Springsteen on guest vocals) and ""Girl in Motion"". The latter being a song in a league all its own."
4,Intense,"If you caught any of Nils Lofgren's appearances on the Howard Stern show, you know the rock guitarist is one intense guy. SILVER LINING reflects that, music, lyrics and all. When Nils is in love (""Valentine"") it's lovely; in hate (""Trouble's Back"") or self-hate (""Walkin' Nerve""), be glad his hands are around a guitar and not your throat. Includes guest vocals by Bruce Springsteen on ""Valentine"" and Ringo Starr on ""Bein' Angry""; Ringo also drums the heck out of it on ""Walkin' Nerve."" Bravo, Nils!"
4,Another Bowie Classic,"This, along with most of Lodger, is the best of the Berlin Trilogy. It has some of the Philadelphia R&B of Young Americans in Sons of the Silent Age and the synth-pop of Low and Station to Station in V-2 Schneider and most of the second half. It also closes with a cool, pop song The Secret Life of Arabia. Overall, the best of the three by far. I can't give it a 5-star rating because that belongs on Ziggy Stardust or Hunky Dory. But this, along with Station to Station and The Man Who Sold The World, does deserve 4 and 1/2 stars."
4,A great album,"Again, as Low was, half of ""Heroes"" is insrumental. But unfortunately, whereas the instrumentals on Low keep getting better and better on repeated listenings, those on ""Heroes"" lose their strenght very quickly. They're just not as layered and tend to become a bit boring over time. It's a shame 'cause the vocal tracks on ""Heroes"" are quite simply the best Bowie has ever recorded. A great deal of that is due to the guitar work of Robert Fripp; the man is absolutely amazing. I mean, even without him shredding his way through the songs, they would still be great, but he really takes things to another level. Add the two sides togheter and you still have a great album."
4,Heros a Great blast from the past,When Heros first came out I bought it on vinyl. I loved it. Played it a lot. Then I sold my collection togo to Germany. Sigh. Now it is good to have this great effort by Bowie and Eno.
4,See a different world,"Bowie's artistic credibility (a fairly tattered thing, nowadays) was built largely around the fact that in the mid- to late-70's he took off to Europe and started making hugely uncommercial (yet hugely influential) music with ex-Roxy Music man Brian Eno. The results of this collaboration were patchy but never less than interesting. 'Heroes' (the quotation marks are a deliberate irony) is a unique mix of fuzzy guitars, prototype electronics, murky vocals and delicate instrumentals. Highlights: the title track, one of the greatest love songs ever written; 'Joe the Lion'; 'Beauty and the Beast'. This ranks up with the Cure's 'Faith' as an album that transports you into a frame of mind that's oddly disquieting. Listen, and prepare to be... can't explain it, really. But one thing's for sure: It's genuinely original; there's nothing quite like it."
4,Bowie's best from Berlin,"I can see why U2 chose to record their 'Achtung Baby' in Berlin's Hansa Studios -- after all, it's the birthplace of 'Heroes,' one of the greatest sounding albums ever made. Too bad the songwriting is not always up to the excellence of the sound, though. Hope I don't offend too many of the faithful out there, but I've got to say the rockers that dominate the first half of this album are weak. ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Joe the Lion,"" ""Blackout"" -- all three boast a spectacular, dense rock'n'roll sound and wonderfully weird lyrics, but the tunes themselves are very average. A shame, because the two ballads (the epic title track and ""Sons of the Silent Age"") are gorgeous. The second half of the album is stronger, with a long suite of instrumentals, far superior to those on 'Low.' Plus it has ""The Secret Life of Arabia,"" which is your favorite song, remember?"
4,"Low, Part II","Recorded the same year as the legendary 'Low,' 'Heroes' manages to rock harder than that album. And those ""songs"" are basically all top-notch, the best being the title track, ""Sons Of the Silent Age"", and ""Beauty and the Beast."" Thankfully, these songs take up most of the album's length, because the instrumentals, except for ""V-2 Schneider"" (which actually does have vocals, but in a Kraftwerk kind of limited way), are way unengaging, if more experimental. Great album despite this, though."
4,Heroes,"Heroes being the second in Bowie's ""Berlin Triology"" was released 1977 and contains hits such ""Heroes"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"". The cd booklet is filled with many photographs of Bowie in different poses and what the front cover wants to convey I have no idea. 4/5."
4,Berlin,"Eno said this was really Bowie's baby and that he didn't have much to do with it, unlike Low. But his influence can be seen throughout the album, especially the instrumental tracks on side 2. Tony Visconti explained how they got the vocal sound on ""Heroes"" by setting up three mics at different distances with gates on them. When Bowie let loose, the mics kicked in with a new sound. It may be technical but on record it's amazing. The German version from Sound and Vision is chilling. The second side has nice instrumentals and perhaps we can say Bowie discovered New Age music, predating it's popularity by a full decade. ""Moss Garden"" stands out as especially beautiful. This is one of the more experimental albums and contains only one hit, but is really worth the effort."
4,A collection of musical accidents,"On his previous album, David Bowie sang about ""Always Crashing in the Same Car."" The album ""Heroes"" is that car, and each composition on it is an inspired and fascinating musical accident. It's hard to get worked up about randomly assembled lyrics and bleak instrumentals, yet neither can you escape the visceral chill of Bowie's bleak Berlin soundscape. It's not all depressing though. Bowie and Eno serve up whisps and strains of happily tinkling bells, while Fripp adds some cheer with his sinuous guitar licks."
5,Bleak but Wonderful,"Please consider this jagged postmodern Bowie album. I'm not sure what he's talking about lyrics wise, but the mood is happy and the music's great. The atmosphere is bleak but serene. Check it out."
2,"Only three good songs. ""Masterpiece""? Nonsense! Don't believe the hype!","I guess the title of my review says it all. The rest would just be filler. Better to get a ""greatest hits"" compilation that will give you the 3 good songs, or the soundtrack to Christiane F. For a great album with all good songs, no fillers, try ""The Rise and Fall Of Ziggy Stardust..."""
2,Lackluster to my ears,"I'm a fan, generally, of David Bowie and decided to investigate back into his catalog. This disk didn't do anything for me -- it's more like early Lou Reed, but rougher, less focused and less interesting. I'd advise a careful listen to the sample tracks before you purchase to decide if you'll like this 1977 Bowie."
2,Mediocre,"Jet Lag proves that just because it's in French, doesnt mean it's good. The movie is dull and looks like a French version of an American romantic comedy. If there was an American version, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan would star in it. There are so many good French movie, Jet Lag isnt one of them."
4,Next Time You Want to Relax and Just Enjoy Some Fluff,"I agree that if this were in English, with American actors, it might not be as interesting. But it's so lovely to see (and hear, in French) Juliette Binoche and Jean Reno interact. This is a good choice for a night when you're sick of politics, sick of shoot-'em-ups, sick of costume dramas, sick of nasty people being mean to each other, sick of dysfunctional families....not that all of those can't make great movies sometimes (for example: Farenheit 911, Training Day, Pride and Prejudice, Closer, Secrets & Lies.) But this movie is for a night you're tired & want to relax with a hot cup of cocoa: it's a sweet story that offers you a few laughs and a little romance. Binoche is beautiful (especially when she scrubs her face clean in one scene) & Reno is sexy, and they both are wonderful actors. Relax, enjoy. ."
3,'Streetcar named Desire' it ain't,"This wasn't bad. It had its moments, the tension between the protagonists (what does that word really mean anyway?) was basically fun. I didn't really buy the 'Hollywood' ending though. It was inevitably the only logical way it could end and yet somehow it kind of ruined it. Liked it better when they were questioning and probing each other than falling head over heels in rapture. But that's what movies like this are made for I guess."
4,a true love story,"I love this movie (I would give it 5 stars if the ending gave us one more love display instead of wondering what exactly she is thinking?)! It is the most true-to-itself love story with a simplistic plot, detailed characters, and, lessons on human nature. Even though the movie was not very long, the interest in each other is so gradual, especially closed-off Reno, you don't want to miss a second of their exchanges. And the icing on this story is that Reno and Binoche do such a great job of showing us the transparency of their feels at just the right moment!This is the kind of movie I want to watch over and over again!"
5,Long Use and they have stood by their product,"I actually bought two of these original cybersonics years ago. I don't remember what year, but I know it was in the late 90's. I had a the same problem as one person above described. The power switch on one of them when bad and would not turn on and off. I called the company and sent it back and they fixed it (or replaced it). I have since lost the second one, but, the other one I still have and been using daily for over a decade. It finally started acting funny a few weeks ago and now it does not work. I really miss it. I have recently just contacted the Amden corporation to see if they would still be able to fix it, as the web site say it has lifetime warranty. [...] Even if they do not replace it, I can say that I have certainly gotten a lot of good years of use out of it. I would recommend the product to any one. It did a great job cleaning my teeth and when I need it it fixed, they did it quickly and with out much a du."
4,let's go....,"Okay, this is a definite period piece. I'm sure it won't appeal to many who don't have fond memories of the period. But for what it's worth, this is a little gem of the late 60s.Tony Burrows lead vocals are great, as are the harmonies."
3,Possible problem with air opening in front,"My father had this drill. It quit working. When he opened it up, he found that debris from what he had been drilling had gotten in through the air opening and ruined the motor. Seems like that shouldn't happen. Design flaw?"
2,Not for me..,"I bought this item after buying the Milwaukee 1/2 Hammer Drilll and then returned the Milwaukee as I first thought it was more drill than I needed. I opened and used the Dewalt. I mixed a 5 Gal pail of Drywall mix with it and felt the speed was too low for my uses. I returned it and re-bought the Milwaukee. Overall it's a nice drill and fit's the hand well but, I thought the lack of power when needed wasn't worth the money. A shame, because I really wanted it. This drill would suffice for most around the house jobs but not when real power was needed. Features were nice, quite, and smooth. Chuck worked great too. Just lacked power. A dissapointment from Dewalt. I'll be looking at Milwaukee from now on."
2,How many Libra women has Robin McNaughton known?,"I believe in astrology. I have enjoyed books by authors such as Grant Lewi, Marion D. March, Joan McEvers, Robert Pelletier, and others. But Robin McNaughton is way off the mark. She claims that Libra women are hopelessly dependent on men and can be mistreated and still stay with a man. WRONG! My sister and I are both Libras, neither of us has ever been in a relationship just to be in a relationship, in fact I don't even believe in finding another half or someone to complete me. I found this description of Libra women a huge insult. And I would rather be alone than with a mean person, or even someone who just didn't thrill me."
5,Just The Best Piano Music Ever,"I keep this CD in my car and play it on my way home from work. It is so relaxing, refreshing and soothing, especially after a stressful day. I played it so much, that I wore out the first CD and had to reorder it again. It's especially nice to play when taking a long car trip. I doubt if you'll be disappointed."
2,Obsolete,This product does not work with the newest Wacom Cintiq 21ux. Although I believe that there is a newer one availible. It is black and Wacom lists it as model number KP701E2 under their accessories page for Cintiq 21ux.
1,Don't buy except if you have an old tablet model,It won't work with Intuous 4 or the last models of Cintiq. Because this reason you will buy a piece of plastic as another review says except if you have not renewed your tablet since several years ago. I don't think that this product makes any sense with this misleading limitation that is not clearly stated in anywhere.
4,Great for graphic artists..,"I've just bought a Wacom Intuos table and decided to get some accesories to work on different things, so I bought this pen thinking it would be really helpful for a non-experienced tablet artist.Personally I think that it is a great accesory but if you are not experienced enough using tablets, pens, etc, it may not be your best shot. Anyway, once you start using it and speding some time using it and trying it in different ways, you will notice how good it is."
2,Only buy this for Painter,"I bought this thinking that it sounded great, but what none of the product info tells you is that Photoshop doesn't really take advantage of the rotation like it should. There is no mechanism to keep a chisel shaped brush tip rotating at the same angle as the chisel shape of the pen. Seems almost pointless now. From what I have read, it works in Painter, just no luck for me."
2,"[Two and a half stars] Dawn Wildsmith, the ex-Mrs. Fred Olen Ray is the 'Queen of the ""B ""s'!","Some of Donna Shock's (aka Dawn Wildsmith's)films are so bad, I feel sorry for her, butshe is one talented and fine lady. Go tothe Dawn Wildsmith site (www.dawnwildsmithdotcom) and find out. She is a very talentedartist, who divorsed B movie maker Fred OlenRay many years ago. Not all her art will ap-peal to you, as she is self taught, but someof the gothic stuff is really good! And shestill has the 'Flame hair', like back in the'Warlords', 'Future Force' days. She lookedgood in her brief appearance in 'Armed Res-ponse', w/ Lee Van Cleef and Dave Carradinetoo! Oh, this movie, it's pretty good andeven though no D.C., her fans will like hercharacter, Delila!"
2,When Bad Books Happen to Good Subjects,"Florman has taken a great idea and drained every drop of interest out of it. Apparently, his subtext was, ""What if the world was destroyed except for several thousand really boring wonks? What kind of committees would they form?"" Okay, I'm glad that I now know about the preparation of and uses for potash, but a lot of what this book deals with-- the interlocking web of technologies-- is much more entertainingly dealt with in James Burke's ""Connections."" If you want a good end-of-the-world novel, reread ""Alas, Babylon"" and give this one a miss."
2,Better at Non-fiction,"A pleasing writer of non-fiction, his fiction sounds like it comes straight out of a writing cookbook. All of his characters are as developed as extras in a TV mini-series, and the book reads like the inventory list for a survival kit rather than an adventure novel. Worse, for an engineer, his scenario for the destruction of the planet is scientifically problematic -- either there should be more damage to the planet or far less.I so very wish this book had been better executed -- it was well conceived."
4,"Great book, but could be improved","I have a sentimental view of Fallen Empires (FE), as it was my first Magic expansion. This book is set in the storyline of FE, with a few changes. An interesting story with an intriguing plot, it still lacks a certain intangible that would have pushed it over the top. But, if you can get a hold of a copy of the book, you will enjoy it."
4,If you like Dragons read this!,"Reod Dai has been buying Dragon eggs from a dwarf for a while now. So when he does not want to buy them it comes as a shock to the dwarf family. They are then stuck with dragon eggs which are starting to hatch. After the house is destroyed by one of the hatching whelps Reod Dai, as luck would have it, walks by and save them by blowing up the dragon whelp. They then head toward an elf village, where Reod Dai is put into jail..END"
5,Genius,Joe Williams' songwriting ability is surpassed only by his lyrical ability. This album is one of the best singer/songwriter recordings of the twentieth century. A record that is this full of love and laughter is rare in this day and age.I highly recommend this to anyone who loves life and loves music. A wonderful sound quality that captures this master at work is proof that independent record labels still can compete with the big box corporations.Thanks Joe--to the bone and back.
2,Just Signs,It is literally just a book full of pictures of actual signs. Only a couple of them might be helpful for teaching purposes to children. Paying 6 dollars for it is unreasonable. You are better off taking your child for a walk around town and pointing out the signs.
2,So-So,"I'm glad to celebrate and enjoy Creation Records. However, i think a better selectiopn could have been used. I'm so glad Creation Records is around to celebrate ""that..... sound. SUGAR!"
4,Excited by their comeback,"I am so excited about the return of Strawberry Shortcake. I had all of them, and played with them as a little girl. I just got finished packing away all my original Strawberry Shortcake toys with the hopes that my little girl will want to play with them when she is old enough.Now, she will get to enjoy both the originals and the new dolls, which are very cute. It is a nice, wholesome toy that she can play with, and I don't have to be concerned that it will be sending her the wrong message, or giving her a false sense of what beautiful and acceptable is.I'm hoping the dolls sell very well, and that there will be more accessories to come. The only drawback I have is the price. I think they are a little too expensive for what you are getting."
4,"Good for kids, not collectors.","I collect the Strawberry Shortcake dolls from the 80's. These dolls don't look a thing like the 80's version. They are dressed in more modern clothes, their faces are radically different and they have slightly different proportions. So if you're looking for a doll to bring back childhood memories this isn't it. However as a toy for kids rather than as a collector's item it would probably be a good toy. It still smells like strawberries and it has nice clothes and a few accessories. I loved playing with my original Strawberry Shortcake doll when I was a little girl so I would assume that young girls would enjoy the modern version. I have to admit that even though these new dolls are very different from the old ones I still bought two for my collection."
2,Not recommended for avid collectors,"If you were a child of the 80's who played with the original Strawberry Shortcake, do not look to these new editions to inspire nostalgia! While cute, they do not resemble the lovable girl in the green and white tights. The new Strawberry is updated, wearing modern jeans, a striped t-shirt and her trademark pink hat. Needless to say, when I saw the new dolls at a local retailer, I was disappointed. If looking to recapture your childhood, best to skip these dolls and opt for other 80's nostalgic toys."
1,Totally Nude Yoga & Tai Chi,"Waste of time if you are looking for a video that you can follow along with the Yoga. The girls look OK, but not great."
2,"Dark, Confusing and Uninteresting","Ran it once - that was enough. Certainly not instructional, this product isn't even interesting. I'm not sure what the producer intended, but probably only to sell a product based upon the title."
1,Boring!,"Save your money! The Director obviously feels that covering up the nudity with blue lighting, red lighting, smoke/fog, and deep shadows is artsy, but it diminisses the whole idea of NUDITY. The women are attractive, but do not know much about yoga or tai chi. The tai chi women have lots of tatoos (possibly fake, just for the video). This director prefers the red lighting and fog, the yoga director prefers the blue lighting. There are definitely better videos like one out there."
1,waste if time,"Way to cutesy, They don't have a clue about yoga or tai chi. I wanted the real thing. The exercise video was pretty good, I expected this one to be better ."
4,artistically overdone yoga/tai chi based dvd.,"the first priority i found to start enjoying this dvd.was to findwhich chapters could be watched clearly, by adjusting the colour,and turning the brightness up.the yoga one hour part consisted of a few beautifull nude womenadopting some anatomically attractive yoga poses.changes in lighting often made detail ,more shadowy than preferable. the tai chi part was easier to relax and watch,and good for repeat viewing. the four or five girls are all beautifulland naked throughout.the second half of the tai chi matches the vulnerability of the womens bodys to powerplay involving martial weapons."
1,waste of time,"Yes, the girls are naked but there is smoke and they are on a turntable that keeps moving around so it really isn't that much to see what with the plastic trees and things getting in the way of the view.The lighting is poor. It is sort of yoga but not really. The tai chi is even worse. Partially nude women with swords dancing around. I didn't find it sexy or even slightly interesting. It's not even good enough to say it is boring. It is less than boring."
1,Bad on every level,"I have two motivations for picking this up. The first was to see athletic women working out in the nude. The second was to maybe be able to get my wife to use it. I'm not a hairy armpit on women sort of guy. I want to see women who are more than attractive. But these women, they aren't attractive women, they are homely women who have no flesh on their body except for the really bad ball shaped fake breasts in front. If you don't mind bad fake breasts on anorexic women my guess is you still won't be satisfied with these videos because they don't give a real payoff. It's not pornograpy, it's not art, it's not a sensual erotic tasteful workout. It's too bad, the potential for something like this done right would be exciting, but don't count on this one."
1,Where's the yoga ?,"The girls look like they're sleeping. Although, one stroked the shoulder of the other. It's like Chinese water tourture. Doesn't seem to have much to do with yoga. The colors are washed out and soft. I did enjoy the other offering here on amazon, Nude Yoga and Tai Chi. A much better DVD with real instruction. I rate this sequel a zzzzzz."
1,there's a name for women like you.....,"and it's not a nice one. The female lead, Geneva, enters the story after having run away from her husband, after she could get him to bankroll her an Opera part for $10,000 (Old West money so like a million now). Then we meet her in New York, after becoming another wealthy man's mistress (but making up stories so she doesn't have to sleep with him) who has yet again bankrolled her for another $10,000 in another Opera. She then quickly proceeds to be fired from that Opera even before it begins for being an over demanding Diva. Frankly this ""heroine"" is such a *itch and a tease that I quit this book 60 pages in. Save your money-this book is horrible!No stars."
3,Not Great,"I think the Dalai Lama is an amazing man. He exudes peace and calmness. A few years back I was lucky enough to listen to him speak while he was visiting in Seattle. All of Key Arena sat in rapt attention while he spoke.However, this book doesn't quite do him justice. The beginning few chapters discussing every persons search for happiness is very interesting but doesn't delve into enough depth for me. If you're looking for a more thorough discussion of his views on happiness, conflict, suffering, and injustice, pick up his bookThe Art of Happiness, 10th Anniversary Edition: A Handbook for Living.From there it goes on to give an overview of Buddhism and its practice which weren't as thorough as I'd like. If you're looking for a great introduction to Buddhism and the practice of Buddhism, check outAwakening the Buddha Within: Tibetan Wisdom for the Western World"
5,Pretty Little Gem,"My Dad, who has been gone now for 5 years, started a tradition of buying charms for my Mom to mark major life events. When he passed I took on that tradition and with the help if this seller have been able to build her bracelet into a cherished family heirloom.Gorgeous little charm, great price, well made. Thank you for helping to preserve these memories."
3,Best Of Or Just Another Album By,"In the seventies, Savoy Brown played a kind of blues-rock music that would merge with Hard Rock and become metal. I dispute the notion that this album represents the best of the band, but best or not, it's pretty tepid stuff."
3,Dentist Approve,"I bought this toothbrush through QVC (sorry amazon) and it worked well for about 3 months and dies, I contacted Cybersonic and got no help, however QVC replaced it no questions asked.I have been using the second one for about 1 1/2 years, though it does a delighful job, and my hygenist could tell the difference it does not work as well now. I replace the brushes regularly but after 1 1/2 years I now have to hope and pray that they will not pop off in the middle of brushing. I thought perhaps I got a bad one, threw that brush away and replaced with a new one, still no luck.I do like the flossers and can use them without the electronic part, but for the money, I don't think I will replace it with another cybersonic, I will check out other brands.I'm sure many have not had this problem, bought another one (same brand) for a gift and they encountered the same problem after about 6 months use."
1,Disappointed!!!,"As much as I enjoy aircraft, I was thoroughly disappointed with the Kindle version of this aircraft recognition guide. The printed edition probably surpassed the Kindle by far. The images were very poor, and next to being useless. Really wish I could have gotten my money back on this one. My lesson learned, hopefully will save many others from the same pitfall."
3,Good for the casual observer,"This book is a relatively comprehensive guide to North American aircraft that you're likely to see flying today.A word of warning: The book's editing is a bit sloppy, and it really serves as a guide for the casual and curious observer. It's a good book to take along to the air show.Serious aircraft enthusiasts, pilots, and engineers will be disappointed by both the lack of technical detail and the occasional error (which they will recognize immediately). For example, the Piper Meridian is a pressurized single turboprop, not a ""turbocharged"" Malibu. Errors like this detract from the credibility of the book.When will we get a comprehensive guide to modern civilian aircraft, that is both technically correct AND up to date? This book is not it."
3,"Good content, poor printing job","I like the content and organization, but the printing job looks like a poor quality third generation photocopy. Contacted the publisher about it, but they didn't respond."
2,Literally just a field guide,"It's useful to identifying an aircraft and nothing else. If you've often posed yourself the question, ""what airplane is that?"", this might be a useful book. Illustrations are uninspiring though.A few years ago janes published a ""aircraft recognition guide"" it had the ID illustrations but also color pictures and glossy pages. It even told you about the aircraft (approx. details) and even how many were built.This book, however, has none of it. Just drawings of the shape and names of the airplanes. Not even the new janes compare to color edition... sad to see such a good pocket reference go. This one is surely no substitute."
1,How could they miss the KC-135?,"As a former SAC Tanker Navigator, I found it offensive that a living icon of aviation wasn't even mentioned in the second edition. I doubt it's in the third either. These fine birds probably still fly more missions than the B-52's they were originally intended to refuel - a skillful process which happens every single day around the world. So many Air Force aircraft depend on the KC-135 to reach their targets or destination and to complete their responsibilities globally. These planes started flying in 1955 or so and the newest ones were built in the early 1960's, yet most of them are not only operational - they are true workhorses."
3,Better and not better that the cx38 ?,"I have owned 2 of these in the past, both of which did not last but 3 or 4 months. While it actually has a working TV2, or upper tv, band, The weather band never came in, and did not even come in when I used headphones, which also act as a wire Antenna Technically.I cant decide if these were better or not than the cx 38, since it has no sensitivity or reception on the weather band. This is quite unfortunate, because this is quite an affordable radio on our budget. However, They were only 2 dollars less than the cx38. These are also actually personal stereo systems, because the built in speaker was optional, and it can with its own earphones. This is also about the only personal stereo system that I know of, which is analog, and has weather band.I have yet to test the CX18, which was, evedintely, the successor of the cx17, and has a built in speaker and is a larger model, like the cx38."
2,"Difficult to tune, TV and SW bands don't seem to work","I use this to listen to the news in the shower. It's adequate for that purpose, but the TV and SW bands have never seemed to work. It's also very difficult to tune as the indicator is almost invisible. Nobody expects audiophile quality in a cheap pocket radio, so it's no surprise that the loudspeaker is good only for AM news and talk shows. The mono sound is decent enough for music if you use headphones or ear buds."
2,you don't get what you don't pay for,"Nicer volumetric dimensions than the usual transistor radio, but my antenna fell out after just a month or two.Curiously you rarely get what you do pay for either. Ah capitalism... what a great ruse."
2,Wow! Surprised.,"Wow. I was surprised at how much this costs on Amazon. I borrow this sometimes from a coworker to get thru the night. It looks like it's worth about $20. It gets only a very few stations in clearly. ONe weak R&B station that I like listening to will come in on this unit but another channel will also come in over it from time to time. Will do, but would not pay $60 for this."
3,Online Code,I have to purchase this book but wanted to know if it comes with an online code. My professor says I will need the code for online homework and practice.
4,Campy!!,Pete Burns is really great in this particular concert filmed in Japan!! If only it was available on DVD!! I am not a big fan of Live concerts and would much rather see videos but this is all that they have to offer for this band so it is a must have for the Dead Or Alive fan! Pete Camps it up good!
3,SPUN ME AROUND,"I have the cd version of this video as well. I remember going to discos in the early 80s and hearing the song ""You spin me round.."" and wanted to find out who did the song. Well, I found out!! How appropriate that the disco where I first heard this song was formerly a ... men's bar!!"
3,Torn,"It's engaging and what it covers it covers fairly well, but it boggles my mind that it doesn't even touch on 3-4-5 odds, which are pretty standard in Vegas. And even if the bets beyond the Pass and Come are sucker bets, I'd expect a book on craps to be much more detailed about them. I found more info reading the wikipedia entry on place/buy bets, the field, etc. Everyone is going to want to throw down a hard way bet once in a while, just because it feels right.Good book, but another 20 pages on the various bets would make it a lot better."
2,Preston,"Coming from a fan who loves Dark Star, Drumz/Space - I thought the Studio effort of Seastones wasn't all that impressive. The first 10 min was recorded at low levels, you really gotta crank your stereo - the next 10 min follows r2d2 talking... Only one really cool section i enjoyed on the CD. I have the Seastones tapes which is circulated amongst deadhead trader circles and even though the sound quality on these recordings suck, i would listen to the hissier seastones than this studio endeavour. Sorry but i didn't get my 24 bucks worth. I listen to alot of experiemental/ bizzaro music and this is the worst i have heard - probably won't listen to this CD ever again"
5,snider finds his true form,"On his first albums Todd Snider sounded like the new Tom Petty. There were some promising songs though, like Joe's Blues and Doublewide Blues, that had their own sound. On this new album New Connection, everything fits like a glove. Great songs, easy, laidback singing, beautiful arrangements, a band that has just the right feel for ""near perfect"" (that is: not too smooth). A masterpiece that reminds me of Eric Andersen's Blue River.And it's one of those rare records that grow on you: it gets better with each spin."
3,"Not one of his best, but some great new songs.","This is Todd's 5 release that I own. I place it as my 4th favorite. I prefer Songs For The Daily Planet, Happy To Be Here, and Step Right Up before it. There are some good songs on this CD. New Connection, Vinyl Records, Waco Moon, Rose City among my favorites. I have heard the humorous Beer Run and Statistician's Blues on a live bootleg and they destroyed these songs in the studio. I hope to see these songs on a live CD in the future. The studio version just takes too much of Todd's style away from the songs. The remake of John Prine's Crooked Piece of Time is done very well with Prine in on the duet. Overall, a bit disappointing but I still enjoy listening to it."
3,Todd's a little too mellow on this CD,"Just finished seeing Todd at the Boulder Theater and it was a great show, as usual. This CD just doesn't live up to his live performance. The songs are okay, but his unique personality doesn't come through on this CD like it does on his others. But, if he comes your way with a live performance, don't miss it.A Colorado Fan"
3,Not the best work,"Fans of Todd Snider's previous work are likely to be disapointed. His voice is slow, often unintelligible - like he just got out of bed. Lyrics and wit are not the quality of ""Daily Planet"" or ""Happy."" I really want to like this alblum, but ""Vinyl Records"" is one of the silliest songs about nothing I have ever heard. In fact most of this album is just forced. Looking forward to next album. In the mean time I will spin up Happy to Be Here"" one more time."
4,Great surprise,"I had never heard of Todd until I saw him open for John Prine.I enjoyed his songs so much that I bought this album and have enjoyed it immensly. Stand outs are, New Connection, Waco Moonand Crooked piece of time."
5,great value,"I purchased the drill to mix tile thin set and grout. After burning up a 1/2 "" Makita and Milkwalkee this drill has held on through hundreds of pounds of mix. Highly recommend."
2,Lacking Features,Did not come with a standard DeWalt carry case.Old style chuck. This must be an older model soon to be discontinued model.To bad Amazon's description was more detailed.
3,DeWalt drill,Not a bad drill for the price. One downside is lack of adjutment to not drive screw thru sheet rock.
4,DEWALT drill,This is a very good drill which I bought to replace another 1/2-inch drill which kept overheating after a short period of use preventing me from finishing jobs. The rpm on this drill is somewhat slower but it definitely provides plenty of needed power. Not sure how it would work out in the workplace on an everyday basis but for my occasional needs it works just fine.
2,chuck loosens with any vibration,"I found that it was necessary to keep retightening the chuck if the operation involved any amount of vibration, like using a hole saw in plywood. I have a DeWalt drill with a keyless chuck and it stays tight in the same circumstances.For some reason DeWalt includes a cheap plastic storage case with some drills but not with others. The cases are made of very flimsy material with crude fasteners. Buying one for a drill that comes only with its cardboard box involves spending nearly $40. Milwaukee and Makita provide sturdy plastic cases with their drills so I don't know why DeWalt does not do the same."
4,powerful drill,This drill is much better than a cordless drill. It has the power to really drill into metal\wood with no loss of power. Even though it is a corded drill it has the guts to do heavy drilling without loss of power like a cordless drill.Make sure you buy the 1\2 inch not the 3\8's drill for real power.
5,Dewalt Hammerdrill dw235g,I am very pleased with this drill. It is easy to handle and does an excellant job. Recommend this drill to any homeowner like myself. If you want it for commercial use see any ratings from someone who has used it for that.
1,Be careful!,"I found this drill unusable and I returned it. The first time I used the drill I squeezed the trigger slowly, but it seemed to jump from no power to almost full power. I used the side handle and two hands as recommended, but the drill spun uncontrollably and caused a large bruise on my right hand and a bruised finger on the other hand. Fortunately I didn't suffer any permanent injury. The manual warns, ""Always expect a stall. Grip the drill firmly with both hands to control twisting action and avoid injury."" But even with both hands I was not able to control it. This drill may be fine for experienced construction professionals, but I would caution novices from buying it."
3,Judy Moody Gets Famous,"Review of Judy Moody Gets FamousAges 8-15 .. Judy tries to get famous by making a cherry pit from George Washington's cherry tree. This doesn't make her famous. The book is about a third grader named Judy Moody. Judy Moody wants to get famous. At the end of the book Judy does well at taking the dolls home from the doctors and taking them home and fixing all of the body parts on the dolls and that's how she became famous.I liked the book because it was funny, interesting, and cool to read. Judy gets jealous of Jessica Finch because she got her first fifteen minutes of fame after winning the Northern Virginia Spelling Bee with this fourth grade word artichoke."
5,Read If You Want To get Famous!,"The book I am reviewing is Judy Moody Gets Famous and it is written by Megan McDonald. This book deserves five stars. If you ever want to get famous one day, this is a good book to read. It's about a girl named Judy who wants to be famous, so she gets her picture in the paper for winning a spelling bee. Judy is determined to find a way to get famous. Judy also goes to a hospital to fix dolls for kids and she says that that's a reason to be famous.[...]"
1,A kId you are so RUDE!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU CANNOT wrITE 16reviews..,HOW DARE YOU WRITE SIXTEEN REVIEWS. THIS IS TO FOOL YOU. GETTING famous nees a lot of work. Very unrealistic. Really. I was horrified. A kid NEVER WRTE AN4OtHER OR Robert's Revenge will show up!
5,Love it,It's like all the other books... awesome. The first time I read one of the Judy Moody books I fell in love with them. You should read them too.
5,Great,"Got the books as described in the mail real quick, could not be happier and satisfied, they were alot cheaper than the stores also"
1,Terrible condition of book,"I bought this book as a Christmas present for my daughter, and it was terrible - looked like someone had put it through the washing machine - I was so embarassed by the condition of this book that I never gave it to her. I went out and bought a new one."
2,"Interesting, but lacking quite a bit","You can see a list of most every nominee and winner of any TV award ever bestowed, including sports, news, and daytime Emmys. That much is certain. But what you can't find is anything close to a complete index. Apparently, only the ""big"" winners and nominees are listed in the index. Even if a performer was nominated for a writing award, you'll find only his or her performance nominations indexed.It's a good bathroom or coffee table book, but if you hope to use this book for research, you'll end up creating your own crossreferences, so what's the use? The only reason to purchase this one is because there isn't an alternative."
5,THE EMMYS deserves an AWARD,"I really enjoy Tom O'Neil's other two books -- ""Movie Awards"" and ""The Grammys"" -- and now that I have ""The Emmys,"" too, I'm THRILLED. All three books are full of really really interesting info, lists, trivia, photos, all that -- but JUICY DISH. WOW. Some of the stories he tells are OUTRAGEOUS! Hilarious! The best part: Every one of O'Neil's books is superbly written. They're a joy to read and full of laughs. I cannot recommend these books stronger to you guys. I'm addicted to them. Get all three -- you'll thank me. (...) Get these books and follow along"
1,orange eye pads,"Products will not stay on eyes, even when clients are lying still. Too stiff. Perhaps this is why they are on sale. Will not buy again. First jar was totally dried out, but replaced. Took over a month to receive products."
1,A waste of time,Asteroids are being numbered at a rate of thousands per month now. It is simply too costly to spend [money] in a book that become out dated the minute it was printed.The book also contain a more updated CD but it contain so much error. This book is a waste of time.
5,Exquisite photography combined with delectable prose,"Collectible Glass Rose Bowls is an excellent history of the glassmaking artistry of rose bowls. The book starts with a detailed explanation of rose bowls and then studies examples created in the different eras leading up today. Johanna also gives great details on the method of manufacture of the rose bowls that are pictured and a bit of history on the companies that produced each item. She explains and defines many glass terms that are useful in the study of other glass forms.The photography is terrific. The fine workmanship in the rose bowls nearly jumps off the page. If you think rose bowls are simple and boring, you will change your mind in very short order.Collectible Glass Rose Bowls is an excellent tutorial on the hobby of glass collecting. Even if you don't collect rose bowls, you will learn much from reading this very enjoyable book. This book is highly recommended for all glass collectors."
3,WARNING: 2 inch (51 mm) may not fit your nail gun,"Unfortunately for consumers, the industry has not standardized on the length of a 2-inch nail. Some are 50 mm (just under 2 inches) and some are 51 mm (just over 2 inches).Some nail guns listed as ""up to 2 inches"" are made to accept 51 mm nails, others accept up to 50 mm. For example, my WEN 61720 nail gun will NOT accept these Porter Cable 2 inch nails (but it WILL accept 50mm nails, such as Bostitch).Suggestion: before buying nails for your gun,1) take note of your gun's gauge size (and get only that type)2) take note of your gun's maximum nail length IN METRIC (mm) and get that length (or less)Porter Cable makes decent nails that are widely available (e.g. Home Depot carries them too), but they would do their customers a favor if they made them 50mm so they would fit ALL nail guns."
4,The third-grade ghosthunters have a new case,"This is the sequel to The Haunting of Grade Three. The same kids who were assigned to figure out the mysterious happenings at their school are now going on a field trip to a farm with their class. They'll be spending a couple of days on the farm, sleeping over. However, during the night, the boys hear howling and see apparitions of a ghostly wolf. Could the farm be haunted? The ghost hunting committee assembles again to solve the mystery. The solution has an interesting twist to it. It's a good mystery for kids beginning chapter books who like a little creepiness in their reading."
4,Not an expert!,"I'm not an expert on music nor a musicologist, but I like this guy's music. It is American. It is classical. It is darn good stuff. I liked it even more the 3rd time I listened to it. I recommend it."
3,A Fitting Title,"Obviously, this album is reserved for major DEVO fans. I am one. Now that that's out of the way...You guys need to calm down. I can appreciate the experimentation and ""Screw the mainstream"" spirit that went into many of these tracks. Clearly, these are songs written by guys who wanted to challenge the conventional rock music scene of the time. But let's be honest: They hadn't found their voice yet. They hadn't even gelled as a musical unit yet. They were shooting high, and that should be commended. But they were also kind of sloppy musically, and that should be recognized. Just because they went on to create some brilliant music doesn't mean this is brilliant. They were young and passionate and pushing themselves hard and falling along the way, which is fine. Nothing wrong with falling. But perspective doesn't change the quality of the music, regardless of how good ""Are We Not Men?"" proved to be."
4,1 timer,"This is what I call a one timer...Very interesting and I enjoyed it from start to end, but not as addictive as some of the other History channel documentaries that I have watched over and over, and will watch again..."
4,it works on me,"I choose this product because I found my hair become thinner with my age grows. My hair line is retreating, but I did not lose hair at the top of my head, so Rogaine does not apply to my case.I have used this product for couple months already.I found that my hair is obvious thicker than it was. My wife said so too.My hair line is actually grows back a little bit after 2 months.Keep your hair short will be easier for you to apply this product on the scalp.It does not greasy, does not glue your hair at all.You feel extremely cool when it apply on your scalp.After it drys, everything just normal as usual.The only disadvantage of this product is too expensive.With 2 times a day (sometimes I am too lazy and only apply 1 time), it takes 1.5 months most to finish a bottle.Money is the biggest concern if you want to use this product for a very long term."
1,He cried!,"I bought this popper for my 8 1/2 month old, thinking he would love the popping balls. It probably would have been okay, but the vacuum sound scared him silly! As soon as I pushed the red plunger and the vacuum started, he cried hysterically. I even tried it a few times, just to see if he would get used to it, but no luck. I might have kept the product until he was older to see if he liked it then, but whenever I turned it on, the balls kept popping out and it was very annoying. I could see losing the balls within a few days as well as the cats getting ahold of them. Good idea, but fix the sound issues and the balls popping out!"
2,Crazy Toy,"My son received this for his first birthday as a gift. I thought he would love it by the looks of it but after putting it together, which was pretty easy, once you turn that thing on it's crazy. You have to chase the balls everywhere. He just looked at the toy and probably wasn't sure what to do with it. He grabbed the balls and did put them in the right spots but chasing the balls around was no fun every two seconds. Maybe older children benefit from this toy more. They can chase the balls themselves ha ha."
4,SUCH A HASSELL,"This toy was a christmas gift for my 7 month old. Although, my child is amused by it, it such an ordeal to play with. The music is loud and annoying, the balls are fun, at first, until they fly all over the room. I have hardwood floors, so they just keep on rolling, then the cats start chasing them. I am tired enough taking care of a 7 month old all day! The last thing I need is to chase the balls that fly out from the this toy all day! The toy is also flemsy and unsturdy. I want to return it. I can play ""watch mommy run and chase after baby's toys all day"" for free....why should I, or you pay...to do it?"
1,Not very educational or interactive,"Got this toy as a gift -- I put it together, and it was LOUD like many people have mentioned. I didn't see the point of the toy actually because it didn't seem to be set up to engage a baby except to have a baby try to grab the balls when it's being shot up the tube. I guess some kids may like to play with it anyway, but I really can't see the point, and I'd rather my baby play with something where she can learn something."
3,too much trouble,"This toy is too much trouble. The balls pop out everywhere, so I find myself constantly searching for missing balls. My daughter likes the activity, but too much work for me."
2,hours of fun,My one year old boy sat through an entire dinner party playing with this game--it must have been two solid hours of concentration! I am bringing this toy everywhere I need a moment's peace!
4,Baby's fun,Sturdy and fun for baby and young children. Only thing was description stated 6 months and up. Toy itself says 9 months and up.
2,ball popper,"This toy looks like it would be fun, but we never gotthat far. It was shipped broken. The fan didn't workwhich made the balls pop. I ended up returning it to adifferent store."
4,Fun for all ages,"I bought this for my 22 month old and he just loves it. What's great is that my 5 year old enjoys playing with it as well, so it's good play time for the two of them. And lastly, I also get a kick out of it. So it's all around good family time."
2,Anxiety Attack inducer!,"This thing honestly gives me an anxiety attack every time it's on! Between the spastic music and the balls flying everywhere, it gets quite intimidating. My son likes it for about 2 minutes and also gets irritated with all the balls flying uncontrollably everywhere. When I purchased this, I thought the balls were a little more controlled, maybe just popped up in the air a little and back down into the funnel thing, but NO! They go EVERYWHERE! All over the room! You spend more time chasing than you do watching. We finally put him and the toy in one big box, just to control the balls, and he liked that better. Ugh, I wish I wouldn't have bought it..."
4,My daughter loves this toy,"They didn't have toys like this when I was growing up! My daughter loves this toy. She loves watching the balls pop up and trying to catch one of the moving balls. I didn't give it five stars because the balls pop too far and I have to go chasing after them quite often. Also, they need some assistance going back down... But it's still a fun toy overall."
1,Doesn't live up to expectations,"While this toy looks fun and entertaining, it failed to live up to our expectations. The balls fly off the track ALL the time. My kids enjoy putting other small toys down the track more than they enjoy watching the balls. There is nothing interactive about it- it requires that kids just sit back and watch. There are a lot of other toys out there for this money that kids can actually play with and learn from."
3,a bit high maintenance for mom and dad,"a great idea..my boys love the air popping toys and like this one but the air power is a little too weak and the balls often require help from an adult or they'll just hang out in the bottom of the toy...also, my boys tend to just pull over the whole thing to check out what is going on inside the popper; this also creates popping problems...and have fun looking for all the balls every night."
5,GREAT PRESENT,I got this produt for my nephew's first birthday. He loved it! He plays with it with his sister (she is almost 3) and they have a blast!It was really worth buying it!
4,Ball Popper review,"I received this as a gift on my daughter's first birthday. When we started it up we thought it was going to be a nightmare to chase the balls - but after having a bunch of kids over of all ages, it was the one toy that all of them played together with. This was kids from 7 down to my 1 yo. They were all giggling and screaming with laughter for a good 45 minutes they were captivated. I had to purchase it when my friend's child turned 1. At her party even the 2 12yo's were playing with it with everyone else! You do have to be careful to find all the balls - which can go under everything!"
3,Great toy recommend adult supervision.,My daughter found this toy very enjoyable. Until she got her arm stuck in it. Recommend you stay with the child with this toy because of the risk of getting there arm stuck.
3,I WISH this toy worked properly...,"This toy would be so much fun if it actually worked. I'm envious of previous reviewers whose kids are having so much fun with this ball popper. I've exchanged mine twice, in case it was my particular toy, put in new batteries, purchased extra balls and nothing....Seems like in the bottom (where the vacuum is), the balls get stuck and then don't pop out of the top. Music continues - but no balls! It's such a shame. It's a PITA to have to empty all of the balls, put them all back in and try to finagle it so that it will work again. More trouble than its worth :-("
2,Has its moments...,"The concept behind this toy is great, but the engineering/design is not. Looking at the picture here, I believe they may have redesigned since we got our son one 6 months ago as the chute attaches differently as pictured. Perhaps this works better because the chute is constantly coming apart on ours. We've also had the problem of the balls getting stuck or just kind of swaying back and forth. The music is HORRIBLY loud. We have to turn it off if we're trying to watch TV and son is playing in the room. Many musical toys have at least a low and high volume switch. This one desperately needs one!!On the positive, our son does love to watch the balls and grab at them as they pop out or go down the chute. He will chase the balls when they go flying. He's not quite old enough to know how to put them back in the toy once they are out, but he'll get there. He'd probably play with it a lot more had I more tolerance for the music!"
1,DANGEROUS TOY! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!,"This toy is extremely dangerous. My 5 year old was playing with her little brother who got this toy for christmas. She got her hand stuck in the tube, we had to completely take the toy apart to get her out of it. We thought it was going to end in a trip to the emergency room. READ ALL OF THE OTHER REVIEWS WHO HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AS WE DID. For safety's sake-don't buy it!!!"
2,Lot of work for parents,"This product is a lot of work for parents. The top part, where the balls pop out, is not large enough. The balls pop out, hit the side and go rolling over the floor. Within a couple of second, all of the balls are spread over the floor and waiting for the parent to collect them. Also, no matter how many times I try to adjust it, the balls get stuck in the track and need helped along. On the other hand, the music and noise definitely keep my daughter interested."
4,Lots of fun for tots,"I had reservations when I purchased this toy as the reviews talked about how annoying the music was. I didn't find it annoying at all. The 19- mo.-old just loved it, as did his almost 4-year-old brother. I can't give an opinion of durability, as it is still very new."
4,Alot of fun,"Good luck trying not to lose the balls to this, LOL. When the batteries are fully charged, those balls fly. Batteries wear out quick thou if they play with it alot. You can get replacement balls if lost for a small fee from their site."
3,get some exercise,"Hey, new parents, need some exercise? Set this toy up on a wooden floor with your kid and wear yourself out chasing the balls all over the room. Our kid was a little too young when we first got this and I think she enjoyed watching the adults scramble for balls more than watching the toy. I want to think that the engineers purposefully designed it to more-often-than-not pop the balls out of the little chute.... Only problem with this thing is that it takes 4 D batteries - why not make the toy so that you push the plunger so that it uses air to pump the balls out??"
3,Ball Popper,"This is an exciting toy with fun music to go along with the air popper. The biggest downfall is the lack of ability to remove foreign objects that little ones drop in the tube. You either have to dismantle the product completely, or stuff a wire hanger in the tube to push the object out."
3,"Toddler loves it, Parents don't","My daughter likes this toy a lot - it was a gift and we were very excited about it at first.Unfortunately we don't like it as much as my daughter does - the balls fall out onto the floor more than they stay on the toy track and my daughter gets frustrated because to play with the toy more than once requires a break to go pick up all the balls that flew out of the toy.Also, sometimes the balls seem to get stuck in the chute - maybe the air pressure gets blocked or something, not sure.My daughter likes it, so that's the most important thing, but I really wish the balls didn't drop out all over the floor."
2,"Fun for kids, frustrating for parents","I bought this toy for my daughter when she was just learning to sit up as an incentive to learn to maintain a sitting position for a while.The good:--my daughter loved it! It was fun and kept her attention for 15 minutes or so (at a young age, that is quite a feat!)The bad:--the balls really pop out of this thing and if have hard floors, they will go bouncing and rolling around. Plan on spending a lot of time chasing after them if you child can't/won't get them herself.--there is no good way to dislodge things that get stuck in this toy. Like most kids, my daughter thought it would be *super* to see what else would fit down the hole and I spend a good amount of time trying to dislodge a cotton ball from the inner workings.--this is not the quietest toy in the world. While the toy isn't designed to make ""fun"" noises, the fan motor is fairly loud.--the fan motor gave out after a few months."
3,An okay toy,"My 9 month old sometimes plays with the ball popper, more for observing at this point, maybe she will find more enjoyment as she gets older.I do find that it often will blow the ball too high and the balls end up all over the floor, rather than staying in the toy. Probably better for a child over 1 year. We'll see..."
5,They LOVE IT,My boys love this toy! We have had it for 3 years now and it holds up very well!! Every time kids come over to play this is what they always want to play with! It is very durable!! Way worth the money!
3,"Would Still Buy Again, but.....","My 7 month old loves the Busy Ball Popper. However, it appears the wind flow is a bit excessive. The balls are constantly popping over the edge and I am chasing the balls...instead of enjoying time with her playing with it. That is the only downside. Other than that, music sounds great (not too loud) and the colors are great."
2,Balls go everywhere except down the chute,"The toy does not work as advertised. The balls go all over the room and must be collected every single time. The balls do not even begin to ""launch"" on ours unless all 5 are loaded. If less than 5, the balls just stay in the tube."
3,Just a warning for some of us.,"We live in a home with wood floors throughout. The balls pop out high in the air, out of the toy onto the floor and roll away fast under the furniture. I personally really have no need for low education toys that cause you to spend more time with it than your kids. I have used the broom to pull the balls out from under the couch, buffet, table and so on everyday since it arrived. For Moms and Dads who really want a low maintenence toy, be sure you have a plush carpeted area for this thing to stay on. Also it is like a 5.0 on the richter scale, it is LOUD! The fan mechanism requires 4 D batteries and sounds like three blowdryers going at once. You want to turn down the volume on the circus-like music and sounds? No dice. Which is fine if you don't have siblings trying to nap in homes under 300,000 square feet.Huge Carpeted home? Buy this toy; it engages the mini-mind for quite a few minutes."
4,The cats love it too!,"My husband picked this up much to my initial dismay. It turns out that my cats love this toy just about as much as my (then) 10 month old son did. (The cats try to pop the balls back into the top hole as the balls pop out) It's noisy (both the fan and music) and very quick, and the balls go flying everywhere causing all of us to go scrambling under furniture. Regardless, this toy over the last 7 months has gotten more regular use than most of his other toys. He VERY quickly learned how to make the fan and music start all on his own, and he loves ""sorting"" all sorts of things (that don't belong) in the open top hole. It's easier to fish out the random objects than I originally feared. He drags it around with him throughout the house, and it's still in perfect shape. It's also nice that it has a few different songs so it's not mind-numbingly repetitive."
2,Fun but too noisy,"The toy is a lot of fun and my 15 month old son loves playing with it. I wish the popper wouldn't be quite so unpredictable though - it would be easier to deal with the balls falling back into the tray most of the time. However the only reason it is almost permanently switched off is that it is too noisy. Combined with the sound of the motor, the music is very loud and quite annoying. It can't be doing a little child good to be in close proximity to so much noise."
3,"I like it, my son hates it","My 1 year old received this toy as a birthday present. He is literally mortified of it. I think he is most scared of the motor. It is rather loud, although the music attempts to mask the loudness. It sounds similar to the vacuum machine, which he is not a fan of. We put it away for about 3 months and tried it again recently with the same results. He cries and wont even be in the room with this toy. I still gave it an average rating because my husband and I think this toy is really fun! Just beware if you have a child who is sensitive to loud motor-like noises. If your child is scared of the blow dryer or vacuum, this top probably isn't for you."
2,NOT SAFE!!!!,"I got this toy for my 17 month old daughter, she loved it at first. Til her arm got stuck in it! The balls will sometimes not pop out, and a young child will investigate, and stick their arm down the tube, my daughter got her arm all scratched up and didn't want to touch the toy anymore. Then when we moved a few months later, I was packing it up and turned it on, the motor went out, less than a year after getting it, and that was without it being played with. Other than the fact that my daughter got her arm stuck in it and all scratched up its a great toy."
2,This sucker is LOUD,"I got this toy for my son for Christmas last year when he was 7 months old. He was afraid of it because of the noise (it sounds like a very loud vacuum cleaner). I was also not impressed with the narrowness of it - very easy for an eager infant to knock it over. I put it away in the closet and got it out again at 10 and 12 months. Both times, he was frightened of the noise and I had to put it away again. When the balls do ""pop"" they don't fall nicely in the tray that is provided, they hit it and bounce out and go all over the place. Don't waste your money."
3,"Good for Kids, Annoying for Adults","My son received this as a gift when he turned one. He has a lot of fun with it. Unfortunately, the toy is not fun at all for the adults. You spend most of the time chasing these balls all over the place. When they pop up, they bounce and go everywhere. Also, the fan is very loud and so is the music. If you don't mind chasing the balls, purchase it. The kids don't seem to mind."
3,Breaks easily,"We got this as a gift when my baby was born, he started taking an interest in it when he was around 10 months old. After a few months of use the motor that blows air and makes the balls pop up has gone kaput. So you can press the red lever to start the music but that's about it. Thankfully the baby was pretty easygoing about it and just has fun playing with the balls, they're the perfect size for his little hands. I sure wish they could make things to last longer, I'd be willing to pay more for something that will last more than a few months."
5,My nephew loved it.,"My 2 year old nephew loves this toy and plays with it all the time. I am now his favorite aunt. I like the size, not too big and not too small. The sounds are great too. Like all kids his age he tries to put other toys into the machine but I don't think that could be helped."
5,Excellent Toy! a Must in any house!,"We bought this for Xmas for our 1 year old. It has been in our terrace ever since, because they want to play with it almost every day. It's very fun!Now my boys are 3 and 5, and still play with it, even me!Its simple, but engaging, and helps develop the motor skills and coordination, and also logic.When we had kids invited, with put it in the middle of them, and voila! instant entertainment!Its very durable, my niece even put it under water, and still was working perfectly after we dry it."
4,Great sensory toy,"Purchased this toy for 1 yr old. It's an excellent toy. The noise frightened her at first until she got used to it. Someone in the reviews suggested putting tape on the speaker to dull the noise.The air that blows out the tube tends to push the balls out of the ring area, causing the balls to be all over the play area. At the end of play time, you spend your time searching for balls, which is my only issue.She learned how to press/push on toys because of this toy. I would recommend it."
1,should be recalled or have better warnings,while i have to admit my triplets like this toy it is dangerous. you must watch your kids while they play with this toy and it should not be left for them to play with at will. my 10 month old got her foot stuck in the tube and my 6 year old neice got her hand stuck while trying to remove a toy that got placed in the tube. the babies love it but i know now not to let them play with it unless I am sitting there with them.
2,good idea - bad design,"This toy can be lots of fun, but I would not buy this particular one again. The music is really loud and obnoxious. There is no way to turn the volume down or off. While this is annoying, my biggest complaint is that the design is top heavy. If a child tries to lean or crawl up this popper, as most will, it will fall over, along with the child. I keep this toy out of reach of my 10 month old and only bring it out when I can play with it with him."
5,ball popper =AWESOME,love it!! His 5th one and he wants 5 more!!! he surrounds himself with ball poppers ans plays for hours!
4,Fun fun fun,"My baby loves this toy because of the music and because she can see the effects of her trying to stop the balls in various areas. She enjoys it so much! However, she does have a difficult time starting it herself (maybe that's for parental sanity since it is somewhat noisy)."
3,KIDDO LOVES IT,"My 1 year old can not get enough of this toy. This is more of a play-pen toy because the balls bounce out of the dish very well. Guess who gets to pick up all the balls? This has a timer to automatically turn it off, and it's kind of difficult to show the child that you have to keep pushing the button down in the back... I would pay for this toy, if it just kept going non-stop, but kept the balls from flying out better, even though it would just drain batteries. Overall a very entertaining toy, until your child figures out how to activate the toy it will keep you busy to."
4,Great toy if it worked,"I gave this to my sons for their 1st birthday. We unpacked it, turned it on it worked and they were elated! Then 2 mintues later the fan stopped working and away went the fun."
2,"Fun, but loud and requires parental involvement for little ones","Received this as a birthday gift for my 12-month-old. It was infuriating b/c she wanted to play with it and was unable to get the balls out (requiring constant assistance), so I put it away till 18 months. She loves it, but it is very loud and she still asks me for help regularly because the balls get stuck. She has now abandoned the balls and just plays the music and dances."
1,My least favorite toy,"We bought this toy second hand and I hate it! The balls constantly pop out in the floor, my daughter totally ignores it, and it's entertainment factor is zilch. I'm so glad I didn't pay full price for this item as I would have returned it immediatly."
3,Fun if you like to chase balls,"My daughter got this toy for her 1st birthday. It does keep her busy for a few minutes but I find it more work for me then anything. The balls will bounce out of the round receiver and then you or someone will have to retrieve it and then place it back into the toy. Sometimes the balls will not get sucked into the air chamber so you will have to push them in manually. Oh by the way, it's kind of loud so I'm glad my kids don't play with it that long. It's a fun toy for the kids to keep busy for about 5 minutes at best."
5,Kids Love It!,Awesome toy! My son got this as a gift for his 1st bithday and he could use it by himself right away. Has provided hours of entertainment for him.
4,Ball Poppin' and Chasin' Fun,"Bought this for our 1-year old. He was initially scared of it due to the noise, but that quickly changed as he now really enjoys playing with the Busy Ball Popper. He quickly learned to start the toy using the big red button and likes to intercept the balls as they come out of the top of the popper. As others have noted, you do spend some time chasing after the balls to put them back in the toy, but that only adds to the fun."
2,Loud and somewhat annoying,"We got this as a gift for our 20-month old, and I had wanted it for a while. Had I known how loud it was, I would have never asked for it - it sounds like there is a hairdryer in it. The music is really annoying and there is no option to turn off the music and still play with it (bad design IMHO).My toddler also would stick other toys in the there, expecting they would come out. Many hours were spent consoling our child as to why it would not work, and then hours trying to get items out of the curvy tube (skewers, hangers, you name it to push them out). We finally put the toy away and hid it. We couldn't take it anymore.If it had a straighter chute, and was quieter, and had the option to turn off the music, it would be fine!"
3,Go fetch Dada,"Great toy, if you like to chase the balls around the floor, fish them out from under the dresser, out the window, etc...Lucky for me we don't own this, our neighbors do. My 16 month son loves it and will go off play with it by himself without prompting.The problem is that the balls go flying all over the place no matter what you do. So its entertaining for him, and a workout for me.Great idea, but a poor design."
1,should be recalled and relabled for a different age group,My 23 month old daughter got her arm jammed in the tube and it took 10 minutes to get it out. (While of course she is screaming and crying.) If the yellow gaurd on the top actually stayed on she would never have been able to get her arm in there. But of course it isn't very child friendly when they can pull the whole toy apart. Thanks Hasbro for the very unsafe toy!
1,horrible,"This is the worst baby toy my daughter has. To start with, the fan used to blow the balls up the tube is extremely noisy - it scared my daughter, who was under 1 at the time and is still afraid of the noise at 2. Secondly, it blows the balls up and out of the toy, shooting them all over the floor. The music it plays is also way too loud and there's not way to adjust. Sometimes the balls get stuck, and its very difficult to disassemble the casing to remove a stuck ball. Simply awful invention."
3,Great fun but breaks easy,"I bought this for my daughter for her 1st birthday. She and my 4 year-old daughter loved it. However, only a few months later the toy, which is a bit heavy, was dropped (as all toys are), and the fan stopped blowing. Now the balls don't pop out of it. Just the music plays, which, by the way, can be a bit annoying after 15 minutes. Also, the two top parts which the balls roll down keep coming off and are hard to get back on and keep on.So now I don't know if I should throw it away or try to have it repaired. Needless to say, my kids are disappointed and me (...) a bit mad.Your kids will love it as long as it doesn't break. Don't let them carry it around the house."
1,waste of money,"This is one of the stupidest toys we've ever had (it was a gift). There is nothing for the kids to actually do, other than turn it on. The only thing my daughter wanted to do with it is put her other toys in it and watch it jam and have us fish the toys out. You may as well just turn on the TV."
1,AWFUL TOY!,This toy is awful. It doesn't ever stay together!!!! My two sons ages 1 and 2 enjoy it when it is together but it only takes minutes to come apart again. It is apart more than it is together in our house. I definitely do NOT recommend this toy to anyone!
2,Scared the Kid,"We bought this toy for our 10 month old. It made him cry. He seems to be scared of the balls flying out, not the noise. We were surprised by his reaction."
4,Good Stuff!,"Whoa! this got expensive! 100.00? must be a typo. nevertheless this doohickey kept my kid entertained for months and it's good on batteries. Pretty soon he started putting other things down the chute. A real kick is to put pieces of tissue paper in it and watch it fly out the other end. Pretty easy to clean and to unjam when a piece of playdough, diaper or biscuit gets shoved in there. All in all it's a goot and novel piece of work... just costs about 20.00 at Toys R Us."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED Son on Christmas last year,I bought this toy for my 7 month old son and that same day - it broke! Replaced batteries - no go! so it was sad to say he didn't get to enjoy this bogus toy.....
5,really fun for my 11 month old,"we bought this for my 11 month old daughter & she loves it. it has cute music & the balls going in up, & around keep her occupied. its even fun to play with it with her. =)my only problem is that the balls do have a tendancy to fly out of the thing & go all over the floor instead of going back & dropping down, but it's not such a big problem that i wouldn't recommend it. it just means that you have to keep getting the balls before the dog does haha. =P but she loves it."
2,Scared Silly,I bought this toy for my one-year-old son. As soon as I turned it on my son screamed and cried. The motor that pops the balls out and the music are extremely loud. They even make my Golden Retriever seek refuge. I wish I would have tried it out before purchasing it.
3,Not so busy ball popper,"Our twins liked the multi colored balls that came with this toy (at 2 years old they still like the balls) but never got into the toy itself, nor did I. I thought this was interesting given how many other people here seemed to have fantastic experiences with the ball popper."
1,Too noisy,"I think the concept of this toy is a good one, but unfortunately, it was way too noisy and just freaked out my toddler. This is the type of toy that I think she would really have enjoyed (for the cause-and-effect aspect), but she was too terrified to even approach it."
4,"I hate to admit it, but both kids LOVE this toy!","We received this toy as a gift years ago for our daughter (now almost 5 years old). While I was not thrilled to have yet another noisy piece of plastic in the house, she LOVED it. Loved it. After I had packed away almost all of her ""baby"" toys, this one managed to keep its place in her bedroom. We recently took it out again for our second child - a 10-month old boy. He too is in love with this toy. And the best part is that this is a toy that despite their 4-year age difference, they actually enjoy playing together. The balls tend to fly out of the top somewhat haphazardly (not sure if this is by design or flaw?), but when they do, our 4-year old is very happy to chase them down for the baby and put them back inside. The baby loves to grab the balls, dance to the music, and crawl around the kitchen after the balls. So while this toy may not be the coolest looking, it sure is a lot of fun."
3,Fun but quickly became a pain!,"I bought this toy from all the amazing reviews I read on here. My 2yr old daughter DID enjoy this toy although the sounds were a little on the loud side and would drown out any conversation I might have been having with my husband. My biggest complaint about this toy though comes from my daughter shoving EVERYING into the ball popper and getting the items stuck inside. She was constantly bringing it to me to ""fix"" the toy which involved jamming my hand in and trying to fish out whatever she decided had to go in there. When I finally had to drag out the screwdriver just to rescue yet another stuck toy, I decided I had enough of the ball popper and it mysteriously ""dissapeared"". So just be prepared if you have a child like mine to fish out anything and everything that can be shoved down the holes. Otherwise when used as directed, my daughter had a lot of fun with it."
1,2 different versions!,"I saw an advertisement for this toy on the tv. I was SHOCKED that they were still selling it! Years ago, my young son got his arm trapped inside the hole where the balls come out. We had called Playskool and they had us return it to the store and they sent us a free 'I'm sorry' gift.The one pictured on Amazon is the DANGEROUS one that many kids have gotten their arms stuck in. If you look on the Playskool website, they have a newer version which offers a cover over the hole where kids like to stick their little paws.Be sure you get the newer version! It is a super cute toy, and I am glad they have fixed the problem so many have had."
4,One Of The Most Popular Toys With My Kids,"We got this toy as a gift for my son's 1-year-old birthday. At first my 2-year-old took the most interest in it, but my son quickly caught on how to press the button/plunger and make this run. It's a simple toy, and the kids love it.When you press the large button/plunger, air blows the balls up a chute, and they roll down the ramp to go through again. It plays an assortment of music. Part of the appeal is watching the balls rolling, part of the appeal is the music, and part is the fascination of the air blowing on them. There is an On-Off switch for when Mommy gets tired of it.My only complaint is that it's a toy with parts. That is, the kids like to play with the balls, and they can easily roll away and disappear under the couch or wherever. If there aren't enough balls in the chute, the toy doesn't operate well."
4,Great fun,"My 1 year old boy girl twins love this toy, from the crazy balls to the music to the air that blows to move the balls around. The toy has been dropped and climbed on and has held together, but the air flow is now inconsistent. That said, it's a favorite and I would even give as a gift."
3,Boring,My 7 month old doesn't really like this toy. It doesn't keep his attention for long and sometimes there is not enough air to get the balls started popping.
4,Fun to watch,I gave this as a gift to my 9 month old great nephew. His parents told me that he really likes it. He likes the balls going through the tube and trys to get at them. I think he will grow with this toy and it was a great buy.
2,Uh.. not very safe !,"My 13 month old son received the busy ball popper for a b-day gift. We put it together easily and began to play and soon learned this toy is more trouble that its worth. My son has managed to get his arm stuck up to his elbow inside the machine, twice. He was stuck so well I nearly panicked thinking I couldn't remove his arm. He also managed to get another toy lodged in the chute so when I was unjamming it, it and a ball launched quickly directly into my face. I cannot leave my child unattended with this toy now since I worry he will get his arm stuck again or some other toy will get inside it and launch into his face. NOT SAFE! If I allow him to play with it I must be at his side the entire time to ensure his safety. I have since taken it away from him and it's put away. My son is 13 mths old yet this toy ia rated for 9 mths old? There are also no warnings about requiring supervision, arms or hands getting stuck or items including balls being propelled."
2,"Cute idea, but not very safe for 'explorers'","I had read great reviews about this product other places but none of them had the problem I did I guess. My children 1 and 2 1/2 love this toy but they try to get the balls out of the chute when the toy stops. This makes them get their arm stuck in the chute. I was not concerned about the balls popping out because that is what the toy is for 'ball popper' but they come out pretty high and then you have to chase them all over the room. It is a fun toy though if you get past those two things. I do like that the toy does not stay on all the time it runs for about 30 seconds and then shuts off. I would not discourage anyone from getting it, I just wanted people to be aware of the issues I had. I am returning it though."
3,"My Kids love it, but there's some problems","This is a very fun toy! But there are a few problems with it.First of all I don't think it comes with enough balls.Second of all, My kids constantly are trying to put other things down the tube and their other toys like blocks etc... get stuck down there and it's almost imposible to get them out.It would be better if there was some way it unsnapped apart so you could get things out of it that got stuck."
2,Seems to have a design flaw,"I thought this looked like so much fun, but I'm really disappointed. When the balls pop out they either come back down on the edge of where they came out and fly across the room or, as they come down, another ball is coming out and they hit each other and both fly across the room. Within five seconds, every ball is out of the ball popper and the baby is left there waiting for something to happen. When he realized the show is over, he crawls off unamused."
2,Scares our little one to tears,"I see alot of good reviews for this toy, but that just hasn't been the experience for us. Our daughter has always been a bit sensitive to noises. She's terrified of the vacuum, electric hand driers, and this toy makes a very similar noise. She was frightened of it at 12 months, and at 22 months nothing's changed... in fact just the sight of the toy sends her running to the other side of the room. Otherwise it looks like a fun toy, it's just maybe not for everyone."
1,balls don't pop out,We can't get the balls to pop out!!! My baby enjoyed putting the balls in the track and watching them roll down but they never pop out no matter what we do....
4,Warning: Causes Unbelievable Smiles & Laughter,My son LOVES his ball popper!!! He grins and laughs with reckless abandon. I totally recommend the toy! I just wish it came with more balls.
3,Liesy's mom,"My daughter (she's almost 2) and her cousins (boys aged 4 and 7) really love this toy! The problem is the music is really loud and annoying and the balls keep flying everywhere and you have to retrieve them! Of course the toy would probably work correctly if the little ones didn't keep trying to push the balls back in while they are still popping out. Overall, this is a great toy to keep the kids occupied with, but the music would drive any sane person crazy after 30 minutes :) Not too sure what sort of educational value this toy has and I think it's more age appropriate for younger kids."
2,"My daughter likes it, but I hate it!","I hate this toy. I'm always chasing balls. The airflow on this toy is vital to it's ability to pop balls up and then back down into the tubing. Sometimes they pop up and back the way they are supposed to, but most of the time one ball goes flying. After that the airflow is too strong and balls go everywhere. I hid this toy in my basement. It's more annoying than reading the same book 10 times in a row."
3,ok toy,"This is an ok toy, however my baby is always pulling the ramp piece off and it doesn't always turn on when its supposed to."
