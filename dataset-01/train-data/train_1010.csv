4,Funny frat house movie,It's a movie about a frat that has gone down hill and is about to lose it's existence on the campus. A freshman comes in and gets trapped into a situation that he never wanted to be in. A lot of anti-Politcal correctness satire is the underlying message on top of the comedy. David Spade is hilarious. Jeremy Piven looks way too old to be a college student. But it's funny.
5,PCU 4 Life,See this movie. If you cant find it to rent or buy from here. Always look for it on Comedy Central... I am the greatest.
5,Excellent Excellent Excellent,"This movie is so much better than I ever thought it would be. I enjoyed it soooo much ... and I am a girl! It has excellent music, great characters and what can I say ... I'm a David Spade fanatic! It's too much fun! END"
3,Nice shirt but too large,I was impressed by the material. Very comfy and the color was great- I got crimson. But was way too large. I had to go for a size lower than what I usually buy.
2,Not as effective as it should be...,I recently purchased this unit to supplement my Vornado AQS-15 because of ongoing allergy problems. I had some reputable mold inspectors in the other day and they did output readings on both machines. The Rabbit Air 421A let through more than twice as much particulate matter as did the simple and much less expensive Vornado ($119) which has only a hepa and a pre-filter. The discrepancy was so extreme that we all thought it must be a mistake and they repeated the readings with the same results.I asked them what they would recommend for multi-filter multi-function purifier--they suggested BlueAir.
2,Less than impressed,"I've had this for a year now and unfortunately I'm sorry I bought it. It doesn't seem to do much of anything, sure every couple of months it demands a cleaning and a little dust gets washed down the drain, but that's it. Air doesn't smell better or seem fresher. I've still got just as much dust floating in my air and just as much dust to clean off the furniture.I feel like all I've gotten out of this is something else to clean, for which I was privileged to spend $330. I can't say; ""This is no good because..."" but neither can I say; ""This is good because..."". It just sits there running, and other than taking up space, seems to have made no change to my life. Not exactly the outcome one wants after spending that kind of money.I've never before owned an air purifier, and I'll never buy another."
2,just okay,Have had this for one year. No major improvement in air quality as promised. Have 2 dogs and 2 cats and it does seem to help some. I like that you can take out the filters to clean.
1,Warning!!!,This unit created a fire from the wire plug and fire smoke damaged by entire home in 2007. The lawyers for Rabbit Air of course could not prove this although the fire marshall from Brooklyn division has deemed it as a cause. The unit of course melted down to a non descript form of a dime shape plastic with wire but please do not leave this on while you are not home!
2,Not as good as I thought,"I bought this product about a year ago, And if you are a smoker or have animals forget this one. A friend let us borrow another brand Ecoquest, when we were selling our house and the realtors could not smell the smoke in our house. We actually have it on tape ! I have tried this one in the new house and the paper filter I had to dispose in the trash about 3 months after buying it because all it did was recycle the dead air. I would come up from the basement and just smell it, ugh! As a smoker not a good thing and none of our kids smoke and they were not happy either! Adult kids so not to affend anyone! Does not help with the litter box either and we also have a Guinne pig. As far as allergies, this machine has not helped our family at all. We have been more sick than with the ecoquest. I am glad that we donated to the cure but I am buying an ecoquest."
4,So far so good,"Not that quiet, but it has quiet mode. I sense that there's less dust around my room. 600 sq. ft. coverage for this appliance is awesome. Only had it for few months, so I'll write back for an update.*** 1 year update ***Its been a year since I have this product. I finally cleaned the filters. I have nothing else to add, except that it's running like I just bought it yesterday.*** 3 years update ***Had this filter for going three years now, and I have to say I'm still very impressed. When it's on 1-2 bar/s, the device consumes about 8 watts of power. This is pretty good, since you will want to run the filter almost 24/7, on pollen season."
5,18th century Venice laughs at us!,"There are two types of comedy: Goldoni's, andeveryone else's. For this brilliant 18th century playwright, writing chiefly in the Venetian dialect of Italian, penned some of the most delightful comedy in any language to the present day. The plays in this volume (through an excellent translation) show us a master at work: a playwright who, in laughing at 18th century Venice, was helping us laugh at the world. But this is no mean-spirited laughter; it is the laughter of sympathy, of someone who has done the same and worse, and slaps us comfortingly on the back. Life is a comedy, Goldoni reminds us, and only by taking stock and laughing at ourselves can we hope to maintain our wits! Seldom has comedy seemed more beautiful or prfound"
2,Just a bunch of ricer cars with a few McQueen's,"I got this for my son, since he loves the Cars movie. Pretty disappointed in the fact it's a bunch of ricer cars, and a few of lightning McQueen. No other characters from the movie are featured!"
3,How We Operate,"Gomez has long been one of my favorite bands around since their stellar debut ""Bring It On"". They've been very solid since then.This CD is a little bit softer than previous ones. It's not as rough and bluesy. It has a more polished feel to it. Nonetheless, it still has a bunch of good songs on it.Gomez has always been good at writing good melodies. ""How We Operate"" is good, just maybe not as good as their previous stuff. Still you could do a lot worse than buying the new Gomez album. Pick them all up!"
2,How we wish they returned to the way they used to operate,"It seems that Gomez are trying to make themselves more accessible. Big mistake. In ditching their initial quirky, mixed-nuts approach to compiling albums, they are becoming incredibly bland. 'How We Operate' is a scrapbook of inoffensive and completely forgettable doodles, bearing precious little resemblance to any of the collectible nick-nacks on 'Bring It On' and 'Liquid Skin'.The rot set in on 'In Your Gun', though even then there was evidence of life in the tracks 'Bang Bang' and 'Rex Kramer'. Unfortunately it's been a downward slide since then. I listened to 'How We Operate' three times and haven't played it again; probably never will. It'll join Turin Brakes, the last two Cranberries albums and the other unplayed wonders on the bottom row of the CD tower."
3,Now I understand....,"I got five minutes into this disc and knew something was wrong. I lugged myself out of bed and over to the player to check to see if I had put something other than GOMEZ by mistake. Yes, we all love GOMEZ, and they have given extremely good reasons to. But this product is just, well...not right.OK, I think I have now identified the problem. It's on Dave Matthews' new label. I am beginning to suspect that there are ""certain limits"" placed on his stable, or certain seminars all artists are required to attend before entering the studio. GOMEZ was what it was because they were loose, rough. This CD is just too damned polished to be GOMEZ; it's like a river rock. The ""voice"" saves it from disaster (in fairness, about half the album is salvagable because, well, because it's GOMEZ in spite of itself).For good reason, I had never ever been curious as to what GOMEZ would sound like all DMB-ed up. Well, now we know and let's hope things get to normal on the next outing. Gawd bless GOMEZ."
4,Viva Gomez!,"I have been following them since their inception and I love these guys! But, I have to agree with the previous reviewer that this CD is a little tame compared to some of their earlier works; however, that's not a bad thing.There is a little more maturity displayed in this disc, a little more continuity and reflection. They are simply amazing musicians and songwriters, and this disc is another success in a string of outstanding CDs.I hope that they continue to grow and experiement with their sound, challenging us along the way.Recommended? Absolutely!"
2,What does Gomez want to be?,"I came in on the Gomez bandwagon at the time of In Our Gun. Wow what a rocking album that is. I bought an older disc (Liquid Skin) and a couple of newer ones. I have to say they are all over the map. In Shopping Trolley, they're half rock/experimental and half country & western. In How We Operate, they're gone full tilt C&W; AND I DON'T LIKE IT. If you're into C&W;, give it a try - seems OK but I DON'T LIKE C&W.;I'm afraid to check out their newest, Five Men in a Hut."
3,not music festival quality,"i have seen gomez perform live half a dozen times, at least. and i own all of their albums. i am so disappointed in 'how we operate'. 'bring it on' and 'split the difference' are their best albums--unique, fun, and original. 'how we operate' is going to end up being a soundtrack for some random 'fox' or 'wb' tv show. if they end up at lollapalooza, cochella, or bonnaroo, i really hope they stick to performing their old school stuff. i stumbled upon these guys the end of 1999, and i agree that they deserve some fame, but i'm hoping this isn't the album that launches them."
2,very dissapointing,"Same as the first reviewer I have been a huge fan since Bring it On. In our Gun was different than the first 2 but was a great album, Slipt the difference was good, not great and I have to say after listening to the new album twice I have no desire to listen to it again. Even Split the Difference made me want to listen to it over and over, I completely wore out every almbum they put out previously, this one will remain on the shelf. It just doesn't have any feeling. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is Gomez and I have always loved them."
3,Nice effort,"I like this album and play it often. Nice melodic rock that delivers with a variety of styles, ""See the World"" and the Greys Anatomy fave ""How we operate"", are worth the price of admission."
3,"Great band, good album, crap lyrics","Gomez is a great band. This is not their best album. It's merely a good album.Some grit and some lovely songs, melody, contrast, and a marvelous pop lushness. That said, too many songs are not memorable.And then. Will someone buy these guys a book of poetry. No kidding, there are Danish heavy metal bands that write better lyrics (in English). (I'm thinking of Opeth).Par example: ""Like a moth to the flame."" Huh?... C'mon nothing good can come after that.""I wish I could cry on demand. Boo hoo. Boo hoo."" Ditto.""And I'd apologize, but it won't go very far."" Yeah. But it'd help."
3,"A bit too tame, bring back the raw sound of earlier stuff","Gomez is one of my favorite bands, which was why I was pysched to see this new album arrive. After a few listens, I have to say it's ok, but lacks the raw, eclectic sound of the previous albums, e.g. Bring it On (phenomenal), Liquid Skin (no sophomore slump here), and Split the Difference (underrated). The title track ""How We Operate"" is excellent, but I find myself bored with some of the other songs, which was never the case on the older albums. Maybe this is the influence of the DMB producer of this album, which tried to create more mainstream appeal for the band. If that's the outcome, great, because more people should be exposed to the band's brilliance. But would love to see the band get back to a more fresh sound in the next LP. By the way, they are outstanding live."
4,Gomezing,"i saw Gomex perform live touring with this album, and although I had never heard tracks from How We Operate I went right out and bought it. I think the best track is ""How We operate,"" by far. There is more energy packed into that one song than into most ""high energy"" albums. The diversity between songs just shows the wide range of musical abilities within this group. There is variation in style, composition, and musicality in this entire album. ""Hamoa beach"" and ""Tear your Love Apart"" are also amazing. This is a must-buy."
5,A MASTERPIECE,HOW WE OPERATE may be the best conceptual album made by the Beatley GOMEZ BAND. Every song has been deeply elaborated. Can`t miss this masterpiece.
3,Fits as replacement for Virgin Mobile -- barely,"This battery works as an affordable replacement for an aging Virgin mobile phone, but it's probably twice as thick as the original, so the clip-in backing of the phone is replaced and it barely makes it closed. Hard to open again, but not likely going to do that often, I suppose."
5,Poet Power by T. Williams,Most helpful! Learned a great deal from his suggestions! Highly recommend to poets looking for some good suggestions to use if wanting to publish.
4,Moderate exercise video,"I used this video years ago when I led an exercise class at church. I recently added low-impact aerobics to my exercise routine, and this tape works well, even for a senior citizen. This exercises require just the right amount of effort for me, and the length of the tape is fine."
1,Jesus? Really?,"It's hard to tell exactly who, or what it is. It is very cheap and hollow and hideous and smaller than advertised. It also cost more than advertised. I sent it back."
1,NOT original artists,"The CD is a pale immitation of the original versions. The blurb prepared by Amazon is not correct, someone at Amazon have been false and misleading because on the CD cover it says ""SONGS OF AVRIL LAVIGNE"" performed by the ""CHART TOPPERS""...this is not to be seen on Amazon's page of information at all!If I didn't live in Australia I would post it back and ask for my money back...I have wasted $11.00 what with postage etc...Amazon please get your information right in future.Unhappy Aussie,Tom WynnStockton"
4,Helpful Guide,"I used this on a recent trip to Beijing. Overall, it is reliable and helpful. It is fairly compact and easy to carry around, the road atlas is accurate, the pictures are great, and the descriptions are helpful. Things are changing so fast in Beijing that it is difficult for many of these guides to remain current year to year, and even then information on restaurants and other attractions often change before the guides are even published. A few places list therein were no longer in business, but overall it was reliable. I was able to use this to guide me to some places I might not have considered otherwise, and it gave a good overview of many of the attractions a new visitor to Beijing would want to see. I brought along a couple of other guides as well, including ""Top 10 Beijing,"" which was also helpful. I find that one guide is never enough, so I always get a few. This one is recommended."
5,Shag,I bought this because my wife and I went to Charleston SC and were introduced to Shag and beach music - it is a fun way to dance. I hope it makes it up north someday!
4,One of the finest and smoothest Jazz Sax CDs ever.,"This is ultra-smooth, ultra-lush romantic Jazz. Play this CD, light the candles, get close to that special someone and...Enjoy!"
1,Not Recommended,"I bought this book because all of the photos were taken by a Holga plastic ""toy"" camera. This is one of the very few books of photographs dedicated solely to images taken with a Holga camera. Unfortunately this collection of images is too disjointed. Content-wise the pictures cover a wide range from landscapes, to urban scenes, to people snapshots. Most are color, a few black and white. And although this collection is by a professional photographer, I have seen more interesting and cohesive image galleries of Holga photographs on the internet. Another downside is the physical production of the book. The book is a very flimsy softcover (with an unusual, weak binding) that doesn't seem like it will last very long. I would recommend this only to Holga collector's who must own *everything* Holga."
1,Huckabee has no right....,"Being from Arkansas and from the Jonesboro area I wanted to read the book that my governor wrote about ""Kids who kill"". The book was an ok read but I still do not think he has any right to say anything on this topic. Did anyone know that after the Westside School shootings our esteemed governor would not put off a family vacation out of the country? one of the, if not the most tragic event to ever happen in Arkansas and he goes on a vacation with the family? He had the audacity to write this book after that? When he was questioned about how he feels about making money from a tragedy he quipped ""My kids have got to go to college"" Man of integrity? no way. He is also very unpopular in the state right now even by members of his own party and if he wasn't term limited he would not win again. He does have presidential aspirations but does not have a chance at the nomination."
3,Father Knows Best,"His analysis of where we are is lucid and convincing. Unfortunatly, his solution is a return to bible-thumping WASP mentality.Personally, I'm not certain I don't prefer anarchy and mahem. Religious values that include denigration of women and abuse of children are part of the problem, not the solution.And while public life was undeniably more orderly, safe, and pleasant, some incredibly nasty things went on behind closed doors in the 50s.We need to go forward with a clear, dispassionate understanding of our history. We not only can't go back, if we could it would be another tragedy.It's an interesting book and I'd recommend reading it, but don't expect to find rational solutions."
1,Also full of nonsense,"I was succered into buying this book by some charlatan who raved about it's contents. It's full of nonsense, lies, half truths, and misguided new age jibberish. The book is rubbish. I seldom throw books away but this is one fit for the landfill."
1,Bad Book,This book was VERY dry and boring. I used it for a book report and even though it had alot of information it was hard not to fall asleep. really borring book. This book tells about the Politics and it was BAD.
3,a pretty good source of information,"a pretty complete overview of the HC scene, with a lot of good ideas provided for bands to explore that I had either never heard of or really didn't know too much about.My only complaint is that the Slickee Boys were not a bad joke and that Tru Fax wasn't stupid."
2,Steven Blush is a Barn,"The author is a complete barnacle. When he's not interviewing notorious self-aggrandizing liars (at least from the NYHC scene), he's worming his way into the history of a scene with which he had a marginal relationship, at best. I can just see this dweeb going through the stacks of flyers he's kept in his room at his parents' house all these years from shows he was probably too scared to actually go to or went to but never left the safety of the corners. Assuming the people he ""interviewed"" weren't as big liars as the guys from NYC, there are some interesting facts and anecdotes. Still, he's so annoying the book is difficult to get through."
3,NW Punk as it was,"I just have one comment about the book, in the section about NW, Portland in particular the book states that the Met was the first punk club. The Met came along after many clubs hosted punk bands, for instance, The Long Goodbye, Clockwork Joes, NWSC, Crystal Ballroom, Euphoria and Satyricon. There were shows back in 1977 in Portland, the Met didnt come along until 1984 I believe. I would also like to dispute the comment that Sado Nation was a neo fascist band, that is simply untrue. I am not sure Jerry A is the best person to comment on the scene, however Mark Sten in my eyes is the Godfather of Portland Punk and would be a wealth of great information. I would invite the author to return to Portland for an indepth discussion of the scene as it was with some of us who were there from the start."
2,Stephen Blush is lame...,"I must say I was very dissapointed with this book. It was full of bias and opinions, focused more on violence then the positive aspects of hardcore, trashed punkers and made them look like idiots, completely trashed New York hardcore, and on top of that there were many spelling and grammatical errors. He also made it seem like the band he was a rodie for, ""No Trend"" were hardcore ledgends. Past the bias, the interviews were pretty interesting, and the book has some really intense pictures, but if you wanna know the history of hardcore, skip this. Read ""Dance of Days"" instead."
3,Snah....,"Not a bad book. The topic is interesting. I missed the main hardcore scene by a couple of years, but I still find the music fascinating. Personally I do not find it ""punk"" or ""Hardcore"" to have such lousy editing though...A bit of detachment from the whole scene, at least when writing about it, would have also served the author very well.Overall I would recommend the book, the pictures alone are very cool. The stories are interesting. I had no idea that there was so much fighting!!!!"
2,I really just want to light my copy on fire!!!!,"Steven Blush is an idiot. This book could have been excellent. The quotes, pictures, and information are amazing, but it seems that anything he writes makes the book suck. His musical analysis of Harcore is worthless. He obvioulsy has no musical knowledge. His language is irritating to say the least. I would like to see something more formal and serious. Not 300 pages of his opinions on hardcore. Sorry to be so critical, but it had to be done. It is good to see that people are starting to write more on early hardcore because it was extremly influential and there has yet to be a scene that matches it.Anyway. Do not buy this book. If you are truly intrested in hardcore punk look into it further and buy something like ""Banned in DC"". Avoid this!!!!"
3,"I was there, and it wasn't like this","Revisionist history is in the eye of the beholder, but I've yet to meet anyone who agrees with Steven Blush's take on 1980's hardcore.Blush skips over some major players in his account, short changing the importance of many bands and scenes. He makes the mistake of many who have tried to write about this subject, ignoring a bigger picture to instead focus on events that were important to him.The best part of AMERICAN HARDCORE are the interviews, with the passage of time the participants are able to dish the dirt and take some of the more self indulgent players down a peg or two.As gossip, this book is a fine read, but as an overview of hardcore punk rock in the '80s, this falls short, and I cringe when I see Blush quoted as an authority on the subject."
3,"Nice Basic Summary, alot of bands and information was left out or inaccurate.","To think that the Germs were not considered a hardcore band and just a ""punk"" band is distorted. Anyone who has listened to the GI album will disagree on the Middle Class being the first hardcore band. there are Texas bands like the Vomit Pigs who were hardcore and not given the significant credit they deserve. On Vicious Circle (Jack Grisham's first band) comments of beach punk we need to remember the Klan who were also significant. the Crowd of course from H.B. and the Simpletones from Rosemead are significant bands that also need mention. Alot of Early Dangerhouse bands, bands on Posh Boy records and of course Radical records. the Big boys did get some credit, what about the Huns? Negative trend with the Original singer Rozz. nice over-view but there is alot of historical commentary that is not 100 percent accurate."
2,the fool wins,"This is a take off on the Ukranian~Russian folktale called 'Salt' in the Childcraft 1954 series. However, this tale about onions concentrates on greed as motivation for commerce. Salt begins with a ninny who doesn't want to work, and then the hero wants a good reputation and chooses wisdom and work. The funny ending of Onions induces the reader to laugh at another's misfortune. The images are graphic. Businessmen or merchants are modeled as people who shouldn't be kindhearted or generous. 2 stars because it is an okay read. I recommend the original 'Salt' which gets 5 stars with a real 'marries the princess and lives happily ever after' satisfying ending."
2,Quality Concerns,I have had numerous Ugly Stick spinning rods in the past but when I recieved this rod the first thing that I noticed was the eyelits/guides. Shakespeare must be trying to save money because they have gone to the old school design when everyone else has improved their design. I would not recommend this item to anyone that has owned an Ugly Stick rod in the past because they have taken a huge step backwards in the design of their rods in my opinion.
1,Naive dualism,"Here is yet another work from the anti-Catholic Catholic. The good sister insists that she loves the church---she really does---but she ends up attacking the basic teaching of the church as a sad relic of patriarchy. The analysis is a cartoon of hero dissenters (pro-abortion nuns, Charlie Curran) and retrograde popes (guess who!) bound by Polish peasant prejudice.If you're looking for a truly Catholic presentation on conscience, read John Paul II's Veritatis Splendor."
3,Be careful with the Connecter Pins,Cable shielding and overall quality is good; but have to be very careful with connecter pins. They bend too easily and are difficult to straighten and align again.
4,Very condensed,"If you like to learn on your own then this book is jam-packed full of information. However, if you are easily frightened by math then you may want a larger, more ""friendly"" book."
4,Good book but look-and-feel needs a serious refreshing,This book is a classic. Great content. The only thing it suffers from is that it needs to be updated. it was written in 1987. All the illustrations and graphics are hand-drawn! The book feels like a cross between between a published book and someone's notebook. But you can't complain about the content though. Still worth buying.
2,"Short, but difficult","Good: This is not a refresher, it is an undergraduate level textbook without the fluff. You will contemplate the meaning of mathematics and ask yourself ""what"" a lot (As intended and stated in the preface). The paragraphs often read like riddles, but the math is accurately stated (if you have unlimited time to understand what the author is trying to get across). The few figures that seemed pertaining will carry you somewhat.Bad: Sample problems are too few and not illustrative or instructive. Most problems at the end of the chapter do not have full solutions. Why not? Was the author hoping to sell a student solution manual? The author skips ratio, proportion, and phase in periodic functions."
4,Must have reference,"If you job or hobby requires occasional math, or you have kids in middle school or high school, this book is a must have. It contains all those formulas you were forced to learn as a kid, that you probably still have memorized, but maybe not.For some reason, searching for math online is still difficult. Probably because that Greek guy who came up with the formulas name is so hard to spell. I typically reach for google when I need something, but when it is math, I grab this book."
4,Precalc. Math in nutshell,i really enjoyed this book beucase it showed math in a different way. I used it as a reference to my mathematics class and it was helpful beucase it was easiably understood and i could quickly find answers to questions i had.
2,Inadequate,"This book might be used as a quick reference to check formulas, but it's inadequate for learning or even refreshing. Perhaps it's unrealistic to expect much of a book with ""in a nutshell"" in the title. However, the author doesn't even bother to provide answers to all of the review exercises. Instead, only answers to ""selected"" problems are shown. There are quite a few superior books available which do a much better job of presenting this material."
5,short and sweet,"The book's title says it all. At a time when thousand-page tomes on basic geometry, algebra, and trignometry full of worthless color pictures have become commonplace; it is refreshing to see a book that shows just how simple and beautiful basic mathematics can be.I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates mathematics--not just students."
3,Overly condensed.,"Not sure who the target audience is for this. The book is packed with information but the presentation is too condensed to provide the kind of examples and step-by-step lessons needed to (re)learn the material. As an overview you would be better served to own a laminated ""cheat sheet"" with formulas and brief examples.A book without a proper home I'm afraid."
4,Its a helpfull book,I purchased this book for my daughter to help her with her preacalculus. she said its a nice book she likes it
3,Precal in a Nutshell,"I enjoyed reading this book. It would be good for someone looking to brush up their precalculus skills. But, it is way too condensed. You have to be able to look at the diagrams and determine how the accompanying text is related. If you are very good at geometry and algebra you will enjoy the author's style. If you are not very good at these subjects look for another source to help you. Michael Kelley's The Complete Idiot's Guide to precalculus is much easier to understand but not nearly as elegant."
3,"Good reference, but not a tutorial","This book tries to present the essentials of geometry, algebra, and trigonometry in one complete volume.Unfortunately, this text is only 197 pages long, and as a result the information comes in a severely compressed form. There are no long explanations-- just formulas, brief explanations, exercises and answers.Simply stated, this book is more of a review or reference. It contains a tremendous amount of information in such a tiny book."
3,Lots of tentacles,"Black and white adult graphic novel. ""Erotic Grotesque"" style Japanese Manga. (Labeled: ""Graphic Novel/Erotic/Horror/Manga""; ""ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR CHILDREN"").An alien invasion of a Japanese University. The aliens attempt to impregnate the females to conquer the world. Main character is a female student named Kayo. Kayo is somewhat helped by a male friend named Tamotsu.Strange book that begins slowly, has at least one good chapter and then sputters to a disappointing ending. Contains a lot of alien monster rape of women, transformation of humans, violence and sex.While hindered by being in black and white, the characters are well drawn, and mostly attractive. Overall, the book is a little to violent and falls too far into the ""erotic grotesque"" category."
5,Buy this CD Right NOW!,"If you have young children, go out and buy this CD. It's kid friendly and has very creative lyrics. Parents will love this as much as their kids do. Eric Ode is an excellent entertainer at kids shows too. They just love him!"
4,YOU'VE GOTTA READ THIS BOOK,"""DESIRES OF THE HEART"" IS A BOOK I THOUROUGHLY ENJOYED. THE STORY TOUCHES ON A CELL-MEMORY THEORY THAT WAS VERY INTRIGUING, AND THE AUTHOR WOVE A BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY INTO SOME VERY DIFFICULT SITUATIONS. IT WAS WONDERFUL TO FINALLY FIND A ROMANCE WITHOUT THE VULGARITY. ALL IN ALL, THIS WAS A NOVEL THAT KEPT ME INTERESTED AND LEFT ME WITH A SMILE ON MY FACE. WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR?"
1,Hangs up,Hangs up while im talking 4 times. wont start & close restart again. Im selling mine in craigslist humboldt county.
1,WRONG SIZE!,I wrote the seller about this and no response. Anyway these springs would probably be great if they fit which they do not fit at all. You couldn't get these on with a pair of pliers. So if you are getting these for your Vice Gripper get them somewhere else. COMPLETELY WORTHLESS.
3,Large Ring,"I bought the ring because I thought that it looked good. When I got it, it was a little darker in color than what the picture showed. The size was also too big. The 8mm size was also too wide for my liking. My wife also did not like it and I returned it. Amazon was very accommodating and accepted the ring back and refunded my money."
3,NIce but Dangerous,"This is a nice ring. However, I work with someone who used to work in the Jewelry industry and the only company that has the rights to making black titanium is a company called Merrell. We got the ring a little later than expected, but still came the day before I needed it give it as a gift. Also, the ring itself is kind of sharp. Meaning the seems where the black and silver meet, is literally sharp. We thought we might cut our ringer on it. Overall, it's a pretty ring, but I prefer the real version of it. Not the one made in China."
2,"cheaply made and overpriced, but still looks cool...?","I'm a bit on the fence about it. On the one hand it looks pretty cool and the black fits my personal style well. On the other hand, that black scratches off way too easy! After only a month, I noticed a couple scratches where the black was scratched off. After a couple months, there are many scratches. For the price, I did not expect to have the black scratch off like this. Maybe I am too rough? If the black scratches completely off, I will have to get another ring. It's a bit disappointing."
5,Worth every penny,"I gave this ring to my fiancé for our anniversary and he absolutely loved it. His own mother fell in love with the ring and was trying it on every finger to see if it would fit, not that she would really take it from him lol. He receives compliments on it everyday. When I received the ring I myself was happy with the quality of the ring considering the price is so cheap. People think I spent a bundle on it. My fiancé is a carpenter and this ring is very durable that is why I was looking for a ring that would last him and not scratch up so easily. This ring looks gorgeous on his finger that I can't even stop looking at his hand lol. I'm very happy with my purchase."
5,second helping as a four piece,"after the age of quarrel release mackie left and pete hines took over on drums and the quarrel continued withing the bandfor the next two years resulting in john bloodclot leaving on vocals witch changed the sound of the band with harley on vox and now a 4 piece a bit sounding more metal less punk and more focused and less chaotic and furious but still hardcore,but in it's own right this is a classic release and well worth the money a true must have!"
4,To arms! The unholy ones are near!,Great book full of delightfully useful info. Unfortunately for some its in version 3.0 but with a little work can be converted to 3.5.
5,Another Karajan's masterpiece,"I really cannot be objective if I have to make a comment about a concert conducted by the maestro Von Karajan. What I can say is that it is a pity that all of his Legacy for Home Video concerts have not been re-issued and I feel lucky that I could get some of them. In this concert you will find a variety of composers who range from Ravel to Karl Maria von Weber. If you have the chance to buy it, do not hesitate to do so and good luck in your journey into the magic world of classical music."
2,Blue flames...with sea green outlining,The outline of the flames has a sea green color which goes well with theBlue Flames Steering Wheel Coverhowever I wish to find the front floor mats to match. I wish someone had wrote a review before my purchase.
1,DON'T PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER,"We never recieved our item, and even after emailing Amazon several times, we never recieved our money back!!! Amazing how some people 'earn' a living! The site won't let me give it zero stars...so don't read into the 1 star review!"
3,Not quite what it seems....,"First off, I'd like to state that the Cathedrals will always be one of my favorites. Having said this, this album, attempting to be live, is just a mixture of studio recordings with filtered applause in the background and introductions by George Younce that sound amazingly similar to ""Alive! Deep In The Heart Of Texas,"" possibly released by the record company alone. One can tell this is not a live concert because the singers differ (some include Ernie Haase and Scott Fowler, while others have Danny Funderburk and Mark Trammell). Only two of the songs (that I can tell) have been altered from their original recording (""Champion of Love"" was rerecorded to feature Scott Fowler rather than Gerald Wolfe and ""It's Almost Over"" had the drum set parts updated). If you're just looking to buy the songs, I'd buy this album, but if you're looking for a truely LIVE album, this is NOT."
5,absoulutely amazing,10 yrs and they still havent changed much. this is a wonderful cd and it even comes with a RANCID patch and t-shirt. it has the dude from the transplants and it has out of control thats from need for speed underground. constant hardcore. wonderful. not as good as and out come the wolves though.
4,Ranid isn't going down hill...,"A lot of people have talked about how the new cd ""Sucks"" Or how is isn't Rancid, When i first got this cd i was a little disappointed, but i really came to like it. The only thing it was missing for me was the sloppiness that i loved about them, I loved not being able to tell what the hell he was saying and having to look it up in the book, I loved how it sounded like his bottom lip was numb and how all of their voices together made rough harmonies, And how they sang and shouted but it sounded great But rancid really kept their ability to make a chorus stick out, to make you want to dance/jump Whatever it is you do right when the chorus came on, But before buying this cd i recomend Let's go or and out come the wolves if youre into raw energy and in your face chord progressions.."
5,aguante MINOR THREATH chamanes,"creo que deberiamos escuchar mas a minor threat, fun people y black flag.vivan los 80s chicas!!si alguien leyo y entendio esto escribanme!!en el mail ponganme: vos sos el pelado bombero???daleeeee porfa!chua"
2,Not at all wat expected,This cd is a dissapointment. I heard the group r spliting up and this is not a good way to finsih it. It shows that Tim Armstrong really is a sell-out. He's probably gunna go big w/ transplants since their songs he put time and heart into while this album is so non hard tempo its like rock. The cd had 1 good song its no fall back down. just download the song indestructible off the web and u've got the whole cd 1 good song. Rancid 2000 was awsome hard fast punk like it should be. I had high hopes for Indestructible the only thing indestructible is Tim's ego. unless he can prove me wrong wit ha new kick as Rancid cd in the next few years. All their other cds were good tho they life wont wait cd was the crappiest other than this. The self titled song life wont wait is awsome cept they ruiend it with that stupid reggae guy in it stupid and bad choice.
4,a fun listen,"Bought it yesterday, and upon my first few listen I can safely say that it's a fun listen. Very catchy stuff. Time will tell if some of the songs turn into classics, but off the top of my head songs like Back Up Against the Wall, Red Hot Moon, Spirit of '87 and Travis Bickle I predict will rotate on my Winamp playlist for a while. The album sounds like something halfway between their great 1998 release Life Won't Wait and their 2000 second self-titled release. It has a couple of nice ska tunes, some more hardcore and a few slower ones. The lyrics are the usual Rancid stuff, songs about living on the streets, drinking jack daniels and the idiocies of war and crime; nothing mind-blowing there."
3,Indestructable? Not Quite....,"I don't usually buy into the whole indie mindset about what bands I'm supposed to like, but I will agree with the idea that Rancid is WAY over-rated.However, I don't mind admitting that I own all of their albums, but on my behalf I'll say I only like two...""Life Won't Wait"" and ""Indestructable"".This music really captures all that is Rancid. It's like the soundtrack for a documentary on the band with the music done by none other than, Rancid.All the makings of a fine album are here: The tinny sound of the lead guitar on ""Indestructable"", the calm sounds and surprising form shown by them on ""Arrested in Shanghai"", the toe-tapping style on ""David Courtney"", and the moves from Rancid's less heard from sound file on ""Django"".Yes, it HAS all the makings of a great album, however, like all Rancid albums, they just don't have the staying power that makes albums legendary. It's certainly worth many spins, but don't be too disappointed if you start to get bored with it."
4,"Good, but not great","Well, i must admit....i was a bit disappointed with this cd....i heard the song ""indestructible"" and i had to get the cd. However, indestructible is about the best song on this cd. You can hear a lot of The Transplants coming through....and hey, i liked the transplants....but i wanted rancid. So, it's a decent CD, but i dont think they'll ever touch And Out Come The Wolves..."
4,May grow on me,"Indestructible is not a bad album, but Rancid has done much better. I think this is better than Out Come the Wolves, but not as good as any of the other four rancid discs.No real stand out songs, but no real bad ones either. If your a fan, it's worth picking up, otherwise buy one of their other albums.In all fairness, I already like it better then when I first heard it, so I'm going to give a few more weeks to grow on me before I make my final decision.Re:After additional listens, this is really a great album- One of the top 2 or three Rancid albums to date."
1,rancid sucks (now),"i blame Tim. i feel that the demise started with that crap, the transplants. it makes me sad that they have sold their souls to satan. and to top it off they have that FU#% Benji from good charlotte. i want to know what happened. jus know that it went from_ operation ivy to new found glory. it's a shame cause matt has skill."
1,Rancid Indestructible,"The album content is Totally Awesome, but I did not like the fact that 2 songs on the Brand new album I bought from Amazon SKIPPED!!!!!!"
2,Not so Indestructible,"This is the worst Rancid album ever!The only reason why I give it two stars is because the songs ""Red Hot Moon"" and ""Tropical London"" are the only songs that are cool on this record!I got it off a friend and let me tell you, I am so glad I did not buy this album.It would have been a waste of money!Buy ""And OUt Come the Wolves"" or ""Let's Go"" instead!This record is not like the old Rancid at all.So if you really like their old stuff, dont buy this.I was so disapointed because they are sell outs now.So my conclusion is this :LONG LIVE OPERATION IVY!"
2,"indestructible? nice try, rancid.","try irreperable. as in, irreperable damage to your reputation. rancid's traditional lyrical and musical stomp-along style just doesn't cut it on this album. perhaps they're getting older and too comfortable within the limits of a tight spectrum; in other words, these guys are getting sloppy. the structure seems slapdash and the lyrics verge on the ridiculous (""game over/it's no fun/got me on the run/i'm gonna go get my gun/blam blam blam you're done,"" not to mention the spectacle of ridicule that is ""ghost band."" or the irony of an aging brett gurewitz's vocals on ""born frustrated."" or the absurdity of the political events surrounding ""ivory coast."" or...you get the idea.). the wolves have come out, and they are long gone. i'm going to listen to the clash, whose worst album bears a titular lesson rancid could stand to learn: cut the crap. highlights include ""arrested in shanghai,"" ""tropical london,"" ""spirit of '87."""
2,Rancid has really done it this time,"Tim should have never started writing songs for other people. I hope everyone of you realixe that most of the songs on the new Pink albem were written by... yup you guessed it Mr. Armstong himself. Think about that when you listen to this new CD and try not to puke. They really started slipping with Life Won't Wait but then they pulled it back together with Rancid 2000, and even The Transplants project was...mmm ok. But this disc is a disgrace to the future race of punkdom. Get the new Anti-Flag CD instead."
1,Say goodbye when you sign...,"Need to say more? I could cite a houndred lines from their recent albums or even from good old Opiv times, to point out Rancid did anything but stay'd true.This is what you get when four old bastards trying to convience theirselfs that they're still as young as they were ten years ago. Saw their Homepage? BUY Album Now. BUY DVD. BUY as download. BUY! BUY! AAARGHH!I just wonder if Tim still listens to his ""Energy"" album, from time to time. You know, ""Artificial life in the market place..."""
5,Indestructible: The brilliance of Rancid,"Alright. So I'm not a hardcore punk. I liked Out Come the Wolves and Let's Go, but was very dissapointed in Rancid (2000). It had some good songs but it was all loud screaming hardcore punk-thrashy type songs. This new CD returns to the sound of Out Come The Wolves in that theres melody, meaning, and punk all mixed together. It's the pop/rock sound that is just now coming back to life. If you like the sound the Clash brings, or the poppy sound Green Day had, or the classic Rancid sound, you'll love this album. I think it's there best album to date!"
2,Oh my god what has happened,"Rancid have fallen on hard times, real hard. They are doing videos with Kelly osbourne and the guys from good charlotte. tHIS ALbum isn't that great either i haven't listened to it in a while but it kinda sucks. I don't think they can do anything to fix the situation except maybe break up. The band is just horrible and i don't know what can be done. The songs aren't all bad but i do have to skip way more than i have ever had to with a Rancid album. I'm sure most rancid loyalits have jumped ship."
1,dude......,"Let me start out by saying that Rancid USED to be cool. ""Rancid 2000"", ""Let's go"", and ""and out come the wolves"" are AWSOME cd's but sice this one, I just lost all my respect for them. All you stupid pussies that are saying ""They didn't sell out, they are still cool"" should be shot. They DID sell out. They hang out with Kelly Osbourne and Benji(Good Charoltte). You dumbass fools. That should tell you enough. So I'll leave it at that. If your thinkin' bout buying this cd, go back and buy another Rancid cd."
1,rancid,"I dont know what happened to rancid. And I also dont know why people are saying that life wont wait and out come the wolves are classics and are the roots of rancid. rancids true style is not ska or reggae despite what many people seem to think. their true style can be found on '93 and lets go. if you ask me, rancid 93 and lets go were some of the best punk records ive ever paid for and the rest were just a copout of the clash.not that i dont like the clash."
3,Why?,I have to say that this really is a weak album and i think lars changed his voice to sound weirder.
5,YES PLEASE,This album is one of the best this year. It has the same sound as And Out Come The Wolves...Although it is even better.Maybe be impossible but its true.Don't beleive me? Buy It and see for yourself!
4,really Good But Not Quite Great,More like 4 1/2 stars. It has some great songs but it also has some weak ones. A good buy though
5,They've Gone and Done It Again!,"This is an unbelievable album! It has not left my player since I've received it in the mail. For a die-hard Rancid fan like me, this was just what I needed. This is by far their best album since ""And Out Come the Wolves."" Racid continues to make their own brand of punk, constanly experimenting with new sounds while staying true to their roots. If you are a fan of Rancid or punk rock in general, DO NOT MISS THIS RECORD!!!"
4,punk_rocker_chelsey,WOW! this c.d. is great punk rock.for the people who get mad at the world... THIS C.D.IS FOR YOU!buy it. No they are not sell outs there great! if you wanna go further with punk rock... this is how you start*
5,Classic Rancid!,"After ""Out Come The Wolves"" I thought Rancid would never put out another cd that good;I was wrong! Rancid have made their ""London Calling""! This cd is every bit as good and the more I listen to it even BETTER than ""Out Come The Wolves"". What more can I say? This cd will not dissapoint!!!"
3,Indestructible,"Indestructible~ Rancid is an alright album but nothing more. The lyrics are simple and straightforward and there is nothing wrong with the vocals. Yet it sounds like a weak copy of the Clash and that is not a good thing. The cover is atrocious and looks quite shoddy. I hope they did not pay the album designer a ton of cash since the album design is a joke and a high-school kid could have come up with something more creative and had better drawing skills. The text inside the book-left is hard to read and over all it looks like a two dime project. Do not get me wrong, the album is not bad, but it is just and gets the 3 out of 5 stars that it deserves."
2,PLEASSSSEEEEE,"After listening to this cd, its ok. Its a much softer and poppier then their last albums. I personally love their older stuff, but once i saw their video on MTV, the thing that Rancid stood against all these years, was pathetic. Especially with Benji(GOOD CHARLOTTE) and Kelly Osborne in it,that made me almost puck. I went in my closet and threw all my rancid shirts away. Betrayed by one of the bands that has shown me the way of what punk was.What a spit in the face by some of our idiols. Im going to go puck now."
1,Parental Advisory,"This isn't really a review. I just wanted to point out that this CD comes with a Parental Advisory for Explicit Content. I was ordering because my neice had requested several CDs for Christmas, and I eliminated the ones with warning labels (mentioned by amazon). This one doesn't mention the warning label when ordering the CD. Maybe my ""review"" will save you having to return it."
1,THIS CRAP IS NOT PUNK!!!,"if i could, this s**t wouldn't even have stars! this s**t is not punk! simple plan and good charlotte are even more punk rock than this piece of s**t band!story of the year and the used have better mohawks!punk is nothing but a bunch of homeless looking old guys trying to be teenagers! they should let the new age of punk rock take over and punk should f**k off and die!!! f**k rancid ! they/punk sucks! if u like em, then u suck just as bad!!! rufio,blink 182,green day,new found glory,allister,mxpx,and homegrown r real punk rock!!! not this s**t!!!"
3,alright...,"this was my least fave of all rancid albums, but it wasn't bad at all. they are still my fave band though i prefer earlier stuff. there are some awesome songs on this album. but dont go saying they're not 'punk' or they're more 'punk' and dont go saying that all the bands like good charlotte and wahtever are all disgusting people. i personally dont like htem but i cant say they are terrible because they are decent musicians, and i dont know them as people, and neitehr does anyone else i bet. punk has become so snobby and elite. who cares if an albums 'punk' or anything else, just listen to it. the classifications really dont matter as long as you enjoy the music."
2,What a let down!,"Not at all impressed with this slow mediocre release. Maybe it's to appeal to the young MTV masses that have just recently discovered ""punk"". A few songs are tolerable, but when you have 19 tracks that isn't something to brag about. After seeing them play a good set at Warped I had some anticipation for the cd to come out - huge disappointment. Avoid! Save your $ and buy one of their better releases like And Out Come the Wolves or Let's Go."
2,aww.,"I love rancid, but this cd was just bad. i doubt this will help anyone, but dont buy it and waste your money. buy one of their old cds"
2,What happened?,"I own all of Rancid's albums, and I must say this is the second worst, the first being Life Won't Wait. The songs sounded too much like the Transplants, which is a band that I do not care for at all. I personally thought this album was very overrated. There was too many poppy songs, and not enough songs that sounded like their older stuff.Another thing thats overrated is Matt Freeman's bass playing. I play the bass for a high school jazz band, so I actually know how to play. I'm not saying Freeman is by any means bad or average - in fact, he's quite good, but some people say he's the best bassist ever. Obviously these people have never heard Flea of the Chilli Peppers, or Steve Harris of Iron Maiden (greatest band EVER).Skip this one and go straight for ...And Out Come the Wolves or Let's Go."
1,ok here it is,boy oh boy what the hell where they thinking... all ican say is no sir i didnt like it
4,A great CD from a Great Band,"why are people saying that Tim is dealling with pink. I admit that this isnt there fastest album but it is one of their best. Tim has just gone through alot and has slown it down but it is still punk rock. It is alot more ska punk though, which is what I like about it. Arrested in Shanghi is the worst song but it is still catchy and a good pink punk song. They have at least stayed to the roots unlike offspring and THE biggest sellout green day. They will be back after Tim is done with the Transplants. Overall This album Is way worth buying."
4,Great Stuff!,"This CD is Rancid's most recent release, and it is definetely one of their best CDs. Rancid are one of the only Punk bands that stick to the original sounds of older classic Punk bands, like The Clash and The Ramones. Tim Armstrong's vocals kick ass. My favorite song on this CD is definetely ""Spirit of '87"". The guitars and vocals on that song are awesome. ""Django"" is also a cool song. Other good songs are ""Red Hot Moon"", ""Indestructable"", ""Start Now"", ""Travis Bickle"", ""Tropical London"", ""Roadblock"", and ""Ghost Band""."
4,It is still Rancid...listen you'll hear them.,"The latest Rancid CD is good but less of an old sound. It is more of a new Rancid. I enjoy this CD and love Rancid. This CD is Rancid they still sound the same and still are punk...they are just not heavy punk. This CD is more like Out Come The Wolves, or Rancid the black self titled. Any Rancid fan should own this CD-and if you are not like the rest of the fans who like it from the start listen to it and like it. It really is a good CD!"
4,Very good,"I thought Indestructible was a very good cd. Rancid and Tim Armstrong especially tried new musical styles throughout the album, with varying amounts of success. No, its not the defining album of their careers, but the musical complexity, especially in the lyrics, of this cd shine. The anti-establishment non-violent message of Rancid is still here, it just presents itself in a more mature manner. I think Start Right Now to be most outstanding track on the whole album, with meaningful lyrics and a complex melody. If you're a rancid fan pick this one up, and if you happen to be new to the punk scene, pick up ..and out come the wolves, along with Op Ivy's Energy along with Indestructible"
5,Just Below ....Out Come The Wolves,"Just got this a couple of days ago on red vinyl. Looks AWESOME. But the appearence of this album is nothing compared to the music. Maybe one mediocre track on this 20 track album, which is good.Favourites-Otherside: A brilliant little punk song. Short and sweet. It also has pretty tragic lyrics as it is about Lar's late brother Robert.Killing Zone(Special Track): I don't know if this was put on the Cd. If it isn't I feel sorry for the CD owners cause they're missing out on a brilliant track. Great punk song with more hardcore vocals than the other songs.Red Hot Moon: How can I go past this one. A great ska/punk track which is catchy as hell. A great appearence by Rob of the Transplants. How can you go wrong?In conclusion this a great return for Rancid. A Must Buy!"
3,A little Destructible,Rancid has never made a bad album. But this is not Rancid's best album. Everything is (as I'm sure you've heard) very poppy. And it continues Rancid's experimental style which makes them such a brilliant band. It's not my favorite album but other than that it's okay (thus the 3/5).
3,kind of good,"I am not a huge fan of Rancid. This is the first album of theirs I have. They are very different. That's probaly why I kind of like them. Cause I hate hearing all punk sound the same these days. I like their beat, uniquness, but I just don't care for the singer. He can sing good when he tries, but in most songs he just talks and swears a lot, and it is so annoying when singer swear a lot. This Cd will fit most punk fans. It's good. For people who like real punk, real punk where it's fast, and in your face, not girly punk that my girlfriend listens to such as Simple Plan, and Good Charlotte. Bands like that are band that give punk a bad name. This Cd isn't bad but for real punk, I recommend NOFX, Pennywise, Descendents, and Anti-Flag. If you like girly punk rock, I guess I like New Found Glory, and Sum 41."
4,3.5 Stars,"I give this CD 3.5 stars because it's decent. This sin't their best CD, but still better than all that crappy pop-punk bullcrap MTV plays. Here is a song rating:1. Indestructible 5/52. Fall Back Down 5/53. Red Hot Moon 3/54. David Courtney 5/55. Start Now 5/56. Out of Control 4/57. Django 3/58. Arrested in Shanghai 3/59. Travis Bickle 4/510. Memphis 3/511. Spirit of '87 4/512. Ghost Band 5/513. Tropical London 3.5/514. Roadblock 4/515. Born Frustrated 4/516. Back Up Against the Wall 3/517. Ivory Coast 3/518. Stand Your Ground 4/519. Otherside 5/5Bottom line: Although a decent CD, it's a mixed bag. Buy it if you like punk, alt. rock, or are a huge fan of Rancid."
2,I want Originality,You have nothing to lose by buying this CD but your money.We've heard these songs from Rancid a million times before.
5,The Boys Are Back!!,"Rancid is my favorite band. After a disappointing last effort, I am really excited about this one! The boys are back and sounding like they used to in the ""good old days"". Red Hot Moon alone is worth the price of the album!"
2,Rancid-something else.,"I loved Rancid since i was a little kid and was really excited for the cd to come out but,when i bought it and played it I was highly dissapionted-I mean what is ""If I fall back down you're gonna help me back up again ,If I fall back down you're gonna be my friend""I realize that they are trying something different but it really doesn't fit together.This cd does have a couple of good punk songs on it though like,'Django' and 'outta control' and a really good song about standing up for what you believe in 'arrested in Shanghai' but the other songs are just too poppy for my taste and a little cheesy.just accept that rancid doesn't do it for the kids anymore but,for the money and fame."
1,Wack!,"That crap is Wack, Rancid sold theirselves to the mainstream culture and they call theirselves real punk-rockers! Theses dudes are real posers, I'm sorry for Rancid big fn, but this is not a good Rancid! Guys where's your crunchy sound from the tales of Let's Go or Rancid 2000, this record really deceive me!"
2,I made a mistake,"I'm sorry for the statements i said earlier about this album. I said it was a re-hash of ""...And Out Come The Wolves."" I was wrong. I had not listened to the last half of the album. There are a few songs that are worth listening to, but this album is not at all a good Rancid album. I will give it two stars because there are a handful of good songs, but that's about it. Sorry to everybody that read this and knew this album was bad. Please go and buy either one of the self-titled albums or ""....and out come the wolves."" do not buy this album unless you are a completist."
1,i dont like rancid anymore,"rancid was one punk rock at it best a saw them ,twice in san francisco ,but the are very far away from lets go or out comes the wolves .Tim amstrom, now its working with pink ,what is gonna happen next..."
1,IT SUCKS MORE THAN CHRISTINA AGUILERA!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS CD SUCKS, DON'T BUY IT! IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY! BUY THE CLASH, PENNYWISE, NOFX, BAD RELIGION, or a GOOD PUNK BAND. RANCID IS THE WORST BAND EVER, THERE IS NOT AN ENTERTAINING SONG ON THE WHOLE DAMN CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,wow i never thought i could dislike a rancid album,"rancid before this album had about a one in a million chance of letting down...i loved the poppy ""and out come the wolves""....i liked the experimental ""life wont wait""..hell i loved the self titled rehash of pre-lets go days...and ill give rancid and co. the transplants as well....and i ask this of them now...were they trying to piss everyone off? hmmm lets see making mtv videos with two of the hugest rebel posers ever? well alright the song ""red hot moon"" is good..there is some other tracks that are just okay..and since rancid had a great past i give this 2 stars instead of one. what next? touring with simple plan and avril?..oh yeah i forgot..the whiteboy hip hop ""haunted cities"" by corporate transplants...casual rancid fans...get everything up to transplants first release and stop there...they sold their souls to the devil..aka mtv"
2,rancid's sound...not so indestructible,"this CD, while not the low point of Rancid's career, lacks a certain charisma that they once had. ""Out come the Wolves"" and ""let's go"" are Rancid gold. The songs were raw, and they inspired me, as well as many others i am sure, to a new way of thinking. this CD is where i started with rancid, its the safest of all of their CDs, since it is so polished it almost blinds you. So go and listen to lets go"" and ""out come the wolves,"" and then make your decision, you won't regret it."
2,No Cred,"A serious departure for punk-pop pioneers Rancid, this newest release marks a definate move towards the pop side of that combo. Full of catchy hooks and shout-along chouruses, this one is bound to sell well, but Rancid's ""punk cred"" is history. A few of these songs, such as the title track ""Indestructible"" and ""Out of Control"" still evoke the furious energy of Rancid's first two releases, but most of the album goes for a Clash-meets-Reel Big Fish sort of groove. Lot's of radio air-time, but long time fans will be sorely disapointed. Where ""Out Come the Wolves"" felt like a natural maturing of style on the part of Rancid, ""Indestructible"" simply feels forced. If you enjoyed ""Let's Go"", or anything from this outfit's original incarnation, Op Ivy, you'd do well to steer clear of this one. In the meantime, some newer arrivals to the scene, such as Anti-Flag, look like a much better place to spend your music dollar. Rancid has finaly gone sour."
2,Disgusting,"It pains me to think that Operation ivy turned into this band in the first place, but the fact that they made this album just knocked me off the edge, so far, Rancid had been OK and I had't really decided to make war on them just because their albums where no where near as good as Energy. But when this came out.... Matt Freeman.... Tim Armstrong... my favorite musicians...*shudder.In conclusion you shouldn't get this album. However, I would recomend these very related albums...Life Won;t Wait (Rancid)Energy (Operation ivy)Seedy (Operation Ivy)Let's Go(Rancid)London Calling (The Clash)The Clash (The Clash)"
3,Maybe average,"The album is not particularly original. Sounds a lot like like a rip off of Ayreon, Pain of Salvation, and prog metal/rock in general. I was very interested in this album because of Pain of Salvation's prodigy singer Daniel Gildenlow and his incredible voice. The instrumental aspect of most of the songs is average, but the singers were not used at their max. Lyrics are absolutely HORRIBLE. I can't believe somebody like Daniel accepted to sing that garbage.Please, if you consider yorself a serious progressive rock/metal and prog opera fan, do NOT absolutely buy this album. Arjen Lucassen and Ayreon is what you want to listen to. Buy Ayreon - The Human Equation or Ayreon - Into the Electric Castle and you'll see who real genius is :)"
4,Marvelous,"I have just rented this from Selby Library. This movie is long, but very good, ""Prick Up Your Ear's"", is a film that's Jaw-Dropping. Being a liberal person, I found it's sad that gay people did not have the rights they have today.Gary Oldman is a very intense actor, not only that Gary Oldman is ravishing. When watching ""Prick Up Your Ears"" I watching him play Joe Orton.Kenneth Hailwell was Joe's lover as well as mentor. Once Joe Orton becomes renown. Kenneth goes slowly mad. Which is well shown in the film."
3,Peevishness Pricks,"This film is rather a dark look into gay men's relationships from many years ago. Given the need to hide homosexual feelings and relations in past years, it is probably a realistic, if depressing look into that milieu. The film itself is rather slow going, however. It could use more energy and the brutal denouement is rather confused and vague than it is shocking. Still, a good film to see if one is interested in the development of human rights for gay men on this planet."
3,Jealous Talent,"A next movie of a grey boring existence in London of the Beatles is of a jealous talent killing his partner of a more attractive appearance and successful writer's fate.May be watched, may not to."
4,The Joe Ortan story sort of...,"I liked this film for the scenes involving their defacing of library books (new covers inside flap synopsis)and the librarian playing Sherlock Holmes, to catch them. this is a really funny part of the movie. This film also features men having fornicating with other men and how to do this; So if you believe men should only fornicate with women or just their wives steer clear of this one.I watched this one as an in site to an artist and didn't know what to expect. Also the great actor Wallace Shawn plays a writer."
4,Beautiful art,"I love this pin. It is beautifully made, colorful and meaningful. My one complaint is that I think the ""pin"" part is kind of flimsy for the money and the quality of the product."
3,No surprice,It contains info of nerve block but most are easily find on internet. No need to buy one if you can assess internet easily.
1,not impressed,I love music but I got this artist confused with nicolay who also goes by the name of foreign exchange
4,Could It Be B12,My husband has been suffering with leg weakness for several years with no diagnosis. His neuorologist finally decided it was severe B12 deficiency. I bought this book and it has been so helpful. I recommend this book to anyone who has weakness but a vague diagnosis.
5,Could It Be B12 - by Sally Pacholok,"The most comprehensive book on B12 available today. Many doctors are only partially informed which renders them ineffective. Pharmaceutical companies don't stand to make large profits from B12 so the public won't hear much about this topic from them. So how do you, the patient, get tested and if need be treated and treated correctly? Through knowledge and knowledge is power. By taking an active roll in your own health care. By demanding the correct tests and by knowing the results of those tests. If your doctor is offended or reluctant to work with you then find another doctor. You deserve the best care so demand it! Get involved be your own advocate.Dr. Richard F. NimbachFamily Practice"
5,I don't need an anti-depressant. I need B12 and Vitamin D.,"I read ""Could It Be B12?"" and it all made such sense! This book goes into such great detail and it gave me the courage and knowledge to push to be tested. My advice...be your own advocate. Start reading. Don't make yourself crazy, but do start to look into nutrition and research your symptoms. Few doctors take the time to be curious about what is really going on with their patients. I now know that I've felt lousy for years due to this problem. It was wasted time. As an R.N., I look back on so many of my patients who were quickly labeled by their doctors as ""crazy"" and my heart breaks that they were quite possibly suffering from B12 deficiencies."
5,WAKE UP DOCTORS! YOU ARE CAUSING ALZHEIMERS!,Every doctor out there needs to read this book! The doctors missed my dad's b12 deficiency and now he's got alzheimers. I am so furious! These doctors are not trained properly in the United States. They think you can detect a b12 deficiency through the CBC blood test! they are wrong! I am so furious! Read this book! Most people with B12 deficiency are NOT vegan either! It's an ABSORPTION problem with the stomach!
4,B12 Wake-up Call,"This is an excellent book -- clear, easy to read, well documented, persuasive, and sensible. Just as predicted by the book, my doctors were not fully aware of the importance of B12 in many disease processes. Fortunately, my B12 tests, using the MMA test recommended in the book, turned out to be good, but the work was important in ruling out that particular possible cause for my peripheral neuropathy. It is important that people take charge of their own health, and this book helps us laymen help ourselves."
5,A Wealth of Information,"Several years ago, my sister was thought to be having a series of strokes and severe memory loss. Thanks to an investigation by a diligent neurologyst, she was found to be B12 anemic, and started on the B12 shots immediately. It has made a world of difference. This book clearly details much information on a problem that is more common than we realize, and yet sadly overlooked. After reading this book, I will be calling my doctor to have my family tested.Maggie"
5,Very Informative Book,If you believe that aging does not have to equate to failing this book is a must read. Be prepared to find yourself disgusted by the case studies and the ignorance of modern medical practitioners in the USA but to be ignorant is no excuse to allow your health to decline and not take any action.
4,Purchase of book,"I really like this book, but was a little dissapointed that I couldn't get the 3rd edition - it was sold out - but that's not your fault."
3,MENTAL IMPAIRMENT,"I noticed a parallel between low B12 levels and high copper levels and alzheimers disease. I did some research and discovered that when you have low B12, it impairs the enzyme that converts homocysteine back into methionine and that results in high copper and low zinc levels. If your interested in this connection, read Toxic Copper 0984458107. Toxic copper was written by a scientist and is a major discovery. There is a connection of abnormal methylation enzymes and cancer (us patent US5783605) and B12. See ""Burzynski The Movie - Cancer Is Serious Business"" on DVD for the scoop."
5,Could it be B12 ?,Excellent book. All doctors and patients should know about it. It could avoid several misdiagnosis.
5,What makes a good book,"Some books are fun reading, and some books address deep philosophical questions, but others can directly save and improve lives. This book is of the latter type. It discusses the difficulties involved in diagnosing and treating B12 deficiency, which isn't as simple as grabbing the right pill from the store shelf. It also contains rather spirited discussion of a common doctors' dilemma: what to do with patients that have vague symptoms but who keep coming back? Some doctors consider them to be paranoid ""drug seekers"" while others keep looking for problems. To be fair, many such patients probably are paranoid naturally, but on the other hand--what does it hurt to test for a deficiency in a water-soluble vitamin? Reading this book can literally improve your life, if you are suffering from vague syndromes such as ""near-fibromyalgia,"" ""chronic fatigue,"" ""treatment-resistant depression,"" dysthymia, and similar conditions."
5,Good game but has its faults,"Pony Friends is a great game for people who don't know horses that well as it's very basic. I'm 19 and I got it on sale where I work so I play it for fun. Although its a good game, it does have its faults, as they all do.Pros:There's always something to do.You can create a pony to look however you want it to with alot of color optionsIt's simple to understand and playCons:It can get repetativeThe graphics are choppy at times when the horse movesNot challanging enough for someone who knows horses"
4,"Lame Name, Fun Game","Yes, the name is very childish but this game is actually pretty fun.Be warned though, if your looking for an action packed horse riding game, you might not want to buy this. This game is mostly about pony care.In the beginning of the game you can create or buy a pony. If you get enough money you can buy accesories and even another pony. The compitions are like a mini game where you cheer on your pony, not to loud, not to quiet. And the trail rides are like real trail rides, you don't control the horse. The trail rides might be boring if it wasn't for the ability to take pictures of animals for money. Overal this game is pretty fun, but not action packed.Pros:You can dress up your pony with fun horseshoes, saddles, bridals and blanketsYou can have mutiple poniesTrail rides can be fairly funCons:Not much ridingCan be a bit repetative"
3,ok game,"This game is ok. You play it for about 10 minutes a day to make your allowence, complete the riding task, and to take care of your pony. It is ok for young kids, like 7 to 9. You also might need to go to the store and that is about it. If you have young kids you should get it but not if it is over $20."
3,horse lovers,My daughter loves horses so I got her this game. It is fun but she gets tired of playing it fast
3,eh,"okay. if you've read The House of Seven Gables, you probably already know how metaphor-happy Hawthorne can be. If not, get ready for page after page of in-depth metaphors. In other words, you get to read 3 consecutive pages about rosebushes, material, colors, etc. If you enjoy description (and there is a heck of a lot of it) by all means, buy this book. If you're like me, and get annoyed with over-analyzation, one-dimensional characters, and obvious plot endings, despite the themes of sin, blackmail, supernatural,etc, you should understand why this book was banned."
1,The Scarlet Letter--save your time and money,"Oh Lord...I know I will have people who will totally disagree with me on this, but DO NOT READ THE SCARLET LETTER! I LOVE reading, and I enjoy the classics very much, but this book literally set me to sleep. Maybe I am too dense to understand this piece of literature, but all I can say is Nat Hawthorne turned what could've been a great story into a dull mushpot of words."
3,"Musically fine, but visually awful","If this was a CD it would get 5 stars, although I am not happy that Maestro Karajan skipped a movement in the Mozart Divertomento. The other five movements are played beautifully by the great Berlin Philharmonic strings. And the Strauss is also exceptional. But here is the problem: this DVD was made at the end of the conductor's life. His conducting is so minimal that it becomes extremely boring after just a few minutes. And the camera work is also very dull. Finally, the picture has little clarity, let alone brilliance. Unless you are a Karajan collector, I would avoid this DVD."
3,The fire had gone out.,"I was keen to view Also Spract Zarathustra perhaps Richard Strauss's most powerful and inspirational work, but the camera work, anaemic colour and sound quality did little justice to the worlds finest orchestra.Clearly Von Karajan was very ill and had lost his zest with the baton, this was clearly visible when he had to be helped to the podium."
3,Quick comment here...,"'Bout freakin' time!!!! Usually new Andromeda releases followed every 8 weeks or so. With this release and the last, it will have been 29 weeks difference. I was beginning to wonder if ADV was ever going to release these five individual volumes or whether they'd just go with a box set for the whole season.Unfortunately, I've bought this series the expensive way with the individual volumes, so I plan on finishing it that way. Too bad too as the box sets are a lot cheaper than going the individual volume way. But what is a collector to do?I give this release 3 stars only because it has taken this long to get it release, and let's face it, Andromeda has not been that great of a series since Season 1."
5,"""In High Cotton"" Delivers","My only problem with this CD is I can not decide which track I enjoy the most. One day it will be ""Blue Tail Fly"" (Who knew it origially sounded like this?) The next day it will be ""Angelina Baker/Angline the Baker"". Then ""Lemuel"" or ""Rosin the Beau"" will catch my ear. I wish I had this difficulty with all the CDs I purchase. I am very pleased to have discovered this music and I highly recomend this CD to all."
5,Y'all need to hear these boys!,These gentlemen are not just fine musicians but Civil War re-enactors. (A number of them even residing in Gettysburg!) They have made great efforts to research and recreate this wonderful music in the authentic style of the period. Their instrumentation and vocalization is fabulous. I have had the pleasure of seeing and hearing them in person on several occasions and they truly enjoy what they are doing and put on a great show! It is apparent in this CD that this is a labor of love and not work. You will listen to this collection over and over again.
5,Classic Cutty!!,"I remember having the cassette of this music, which I bought during my very forst visit to JA in 1992. The cassette boasted a bonus mega-mix, whuch, unfortunately, is not include on the CD, maybe because of sample clearance issues. Nonetheless, I'm glad to have this version of the nusic."
1,Real cause for concern,"Yes, this book is well written - but Chapter 6 'The New Age Movement Enters Christianity' - left me deeply disappointed and concerned. Here writes an author who completely dismisses the very scriptural Baptism of the Holy Spirit as being counterfeit and not of God.This is the gift from God, clearly promised by Jesus himself, which descended on His followers at Pentecost and subsequently empowered/equipped them to do His work on earth. I can only pray that Michael Whelton re-thinks, and asks God for this wonderful Baptism himself - soon."
5,Is There More Than Meets the Eye?,"Following up on her previous book, Ashes to Ashes, Tami Hoag brings us into a new Minneapolis based mystery with some characters we came to know in Ashes. An exciting story that starts with the death of Police Officer Andy Fallon's apparent suicide as a result of rejection by his father because he was gay. Next, Andy's father is dead and there is clearly something wrong with what is also made to look like a suicide. The story takes us into the world of the Minneapolis Police Department and what's been going on there over a twenty year period. Great characters. A compelling read. Read Ashes to Ashes and follow it with Dust to Dust."
2,Dust Taylorville,Dust to Dust was a sometimes confusing book that starts out with a cop that they think has comitted suicide. Because he is a cop they wan't to investigate into the situation. as the story went on there was another cop killed and murders. The story in my opinion was very scrambled and at times was hard to stay with. As they investigate they look into other murders to get clues of the one they are working on. Then toward the end there is a girl that they are tring to stop from killing herself and it seems that it is just kind of out of place. If i was to recamend a book this book would be more toward the don't read section. I don't recamend this book for especially younger children than me.
4,Loving the crime solving!,"Once agian Tami Hoag does not disappoint! I loved that we got to see more inside Liska and Kojac personal life as they go on yet another crime solving adventure. Only this time the crime solving had to do with a few of their own. The IA is invold in digging up information on dirty cops, there's also a lot of sucide going on in a short period of time which doesn't sit right with anyone expect for those who just want the problems of the past not to come up!I was happy to see some of the charcters form Ashes to Ashes come back and it referced.The problom I had with Dust to Dust was the fact I couldnt get in to it as much as I did Ashes to Ashes, which I had just fished."
2,Not As Interesting as Previous Books,"Was somewhat disappointing. The premise was very good but the character development was weak. Too many characters with not enough development of any. When I was finished, I felt unsatisfied and wondered about many loose ends. Felt as though I was reading a John Sanford (who I love) but not at either his level of excellence or at Hoag's level either. I would suggest waiting for the paperback."
2,Had to force myself to finish,"I am a big Tami Hoag fan, but this was not one of her best, in my opinion. My mother an I, faithfully, have read every one of her books and enjoyed most of them. This book has taken two minor characters in her last book, Kovac and Liska, and made them the main characters in this book. The mystery is uninteresting. The thing that we like about Hoags books is the mystery laced with romance. There is no romance in this book. I did'nt care about the detectives or the crime. It is obvious that Ms. Hoag wants to be taken more seriously as a detective/crime novelist, but she needs to remember who has made her famous and who her fans are. This is not what we are looking for."
3,Not a bad mystery...,"This is the second Tami Hoag mystery I have read, the first being Ashes to Ashes, which I enjoyed. Enjoyed so much that I decided to read the sequel, Dust to Dust. And for the most part, Dust to Dust was not a bad read, the mystery kept you engrossed enough and the twists and turns were enough to be interesting. But what really bothered me was the ending, call me old fashioned, but a little bit of a happier ending would have been better. I was under the impression that this book was a romantic suspense, but there was no romance at all. The ending left one with a sour taste, since neither Kovak nor Liska came away as winners. I hope she writes a sequel and does some justice for these two characters, the book sort of left you wondering what would happen with them. So all in all, not a bad mystery but the ending did not leave me satisfied enough to give it a higher rating."
1,"Ashes to Ashes, Boring-to-More-Boring","Looking over the reviews, I can't believe I'm reading the same book! I am sooooooooooooooo bored, I can only read a few pages before falling asleep at night. Yet, I am plugging on because I did read Tami Hoag's last book, ""Ashes to Ashes"" and found it engrossing. The only reason I don't just QUIT reading this book is because I've never done that before and I am curious enough to want to know what happens. I can't recommend it to others, though. Do a crossword puzzle instead."
4,Dust to Dust to????,"I thought that this book was one of Tami Hoag's better books although I was disappointed in the ending....I thought Sam and Nikki deserved some happiness from downside of their professions other than a cup of coffee with each other at the end of the book.....the book left a sad spot...Hopefully, Sam and Nikki will return in another book with a more uplifting ending. I especially like the interaction between Sam and Nikki and Nikki's personality as a ""tough cop"". I recommend the book, but don't expect a bright spot as in Ashes to Ashes."
1,Rarely have I gotten a book with this much filthy language,"In search of a new author, I ordered Dust to Dust. I was only able to make it to page 7. There was more unacceptable language in the first 6 pages than any other 3 books combined that I have ever read.This book is in my wastebasket, not to be passed on. Sorry."
5,A Very Amazed Writer,Once Again Tami Hoag has did it again. She has written another suspenseful book in Dust to Dust. This book is about FBI agent Sam Kovak and he is investigating the murder of an police officer. Once again Tami Hoag is created a masterpiece. Read this book make sure your not left in the dust.
2,Tattered,The book was a little tattered & dog eared in places. I would have paid a quarter at a yard sale for it. Pages were yellow. I was disappointed.
3,Gratuitous Filth,"I have been an avid reader of good mysteries since the days of S.S. VanDine. This is my first T. Hoag book. Not a bad story of intrigue, and I have no objection, as do others, that there isn't a sweet ending, but WHY ALL THE GRATUITOUS FILTHY LANGUAGE? Even Sandford isn't this bad. I spent 23 years in the Marine Corps, and never heard THAT much. She trying to prove her macho capability against male authors? Unnecessary."
3,Not the Caliber I'd hoped,"I am a big fan of Ms. Hoag's writing and couldn't wait to read her newest book. Unfortunately for me, this one left something to be desired. I didn't become completely absorbed by the storyline as I have in the past. I felt that while the story was about a gay cop's murder/suicide, I felt the story was too focused on that fact. The secondary storyline could have been better developed and added some depth. A good effort, but I prefer Ms. Hoag's earlier books."
2,Dust to Dust - Definately a Disappointment,"Tami Hoag became popular because she included strong female characters, steamy sex and a good mystery as her basic ingredients. This latest effort includes only one of these - who dunnit. By the end of the book, I really didn't care. Go back to your basics, Tami, so I will want to continue being a fan."
3,Suicide or Murder,"That is the question.... Sam and his partner Nikki aren't certain that Fallon's death was a suicide. Even though the department brass tell them to leave it alone. Kovac and Nikki are the good cops...they need to resolve all questions before anything is final.. The book has a lot of dialoge that sometimes gets confusing... I had to keep looking back the previous pages to catch up on who's talking. Maybe because the story was so dragged out I started to drift into no man's land. I have been a fan of Hoag for many years and have read all of her books and kept wanting more. However, with this book, I just couldn't wait to finish it so that I could move on to better one. Sorry Hoag, this one just doesn't live up to your previous efforts."
4,Slightly different than her others.,"It takes a while to get into the ""cop talk"" toward the beginning of the book, but by the halfway point you won't be able to put it down. There are so many different things going on in here at one time, it's almost exhilarating. The author did a wonderful job of pulling everything together into one story. I only rated it four stars instead of five because I was expecting something somewhat different."
1,In all honesty...,"I am an avid reader and I have read almost every type of book there is so I do know a little about these types of books.Here we go...while the basic idea and plot line is well thought out the only action we get is a couple of fist fights, bullets flying, and a swim through a frozen lake. Basiclly all it is is talk and personally I would have skipped the first 32 chapters(there are like 34 or 35) So I guess if you like boring, ocasional excitment, and well if ya like to figure the book out before the auther reveals the ending then by all means read it but if your looking for something a little more exciting read anything else but this. Hey it's only my opinion."
5,I like the audio because i drive a long way to work.,I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT HAD A WOMEN AND A MAN TALKING. AND I LIKED IT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE CHARACTER THE COP. IT WAS SO REAL MY BROTHER IS A COP AND IT FIT HIM TO A TEE. I HOPE THIS CHARACTER IS IN MORE OF HER BOOKS I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF TAMI'S BOOKS. I ALSO LIKE HOW SHE LINKS HER CHARACTERS FROM OTHER BOOKS SHE HAS WROTE.
4,The best yet,I've been reading Tami Hoag's books for awhile and this is one of her better books to date. A continual thriller of twists and turns that will leave you and the charecters in the book guessing till the very end. I doubt you will figure out exactly WHO did it till the charecters do!!If you haven't read any of Tami Hoag's books this is a good one to start with!
4,"Dust to Dust, Blew My Mind!","Kovac and Liska are what you would hope real law enforcement officers would be like. Tami Hoag does it again, with this page turner. Just when you think you have it all mapped out in your mind, Hoag twists the story another way. Very entertaining."
2,I'm halfway through this book and I'm waiting for the story!,"I'm a fan of Tami Hoag's books and eagerly waited for my copy to come in at the library---and now I have to keep forcing myself to pick up the book and read it! Probably if I had a deeper list of books on hand to read, this one would be at the bottom of the pile! The plot is such a departure from Ms. Hoag's previous books that it's hard to believe she wrote it! This is definitely one of those ""WHO CARES"" books."
2,Dust to Dust,"I was so excited to find Tami Hoag's latest, I bought it on the first day it was released. It is aptly named since it has been gathering dust. I waded through the first few chapters and was so disappointed I gave up. This a very pedantic attempt at a formula police story. I have never been so disappointed in an author's work"
5,Fantastic Information Never Revealed!!,This is the information that JFK did not want released until after Jackie passed away. Incredible information. Very worthwhile watching and keeping for grandchildren to watch as well.
4,Lyra,The device works as advertized which in my opinion is satisfactory. The best part of the deal is that it includes the FM transmitter which is extra with most other brands.
1,Absolute garbage dont waste your money,"Bought this player for my son at xmas. Lasted about 10 minutes then ""file system corrupt"". Had a replacement shipped, this time I updated firmware on RCA website (which they claim is the fix) before even using it. Loaded music and got less than two hours use before ""file system corrupt"". Dont waste your time or money. I have since bought the Sansa E250. About twenty dollars more but it is a great and reliable player!"
4,Player is great! FM Xmtr is lacking.,"Unit sounds great going through the AUX input of my home stereo. Piped straight into a pair of Sony MDR-V700 headphones, it sounds awesome!The control ring is tighter than my Lyra RD2762, but that may not be a bad thing. There's nothing slow or lacking about file transfers, either.Concerning the FM xmtr, it's too bad there's not enough power to reach the radio's antenna. This could have been an even sweeter package with a quality xmtr.All in all, I'm pleased."
1,DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!,"You may think you are getting a good deal, but it is because the item is a piece of worthless junk!! After 2.5 months, my player reads ""File system corrupted"" and it is totally unusable! Don't waste your money! I wish I had read these reviews BEFORE I bought it! I actually give this 0 stars, but the review process demands a star."
3,Keep it out of the heat,"I bought the Jukebox last fall when I started doing a long commute. It worked fine for a long while, but I left it in the sun a few times, and now the battery won't hold a charge very well. I only get about 20 minutes. Also, there a spring in the FM transmitter that holds a fuse in place, but the spring was too weak and it would lose contact. I ended up stuffing pieces of aluminum foil in to ensure that it would make contact. (Don't do this unless you know what you're doing, because if the fuse is short-circuited, it could start a fire -- if the fuse can't, well, defuse an overpower event). The price was right, and it got me through some long car rides, but I wouldn't buy it again."
1,I want my money back,"I thought I was getting a bargain with all the trinkets and features that came with the player. I had to download a new version of Windows Media, that did not work. I did all the upgrading and followed all the instructions and still got no results at all. I should have read the reviews before purchasing. I hope RCA gets annihilated."
1,Same problem as everyone else,"I was extremely happy with the product for the first two days, but I got the ""File system corrupted"" message on the third day. I should have known. Every RCA product I have ever bought has been a piece of junk, so I blame myself."
1,Don't Buy this Product!!!!,"I too had the ""File System Corrupted"" problem. I only used it for three days before encountering the problem and it is completly unusable now."
1,Junk!!,"I bought this for my daughter for x-mas and after about 3hrs, we also go the ""file system corrupted"" and another message that said the hard drive was overheated. She only got to listen to it for about 20 mins. Also, this was a doorbuster deal from Walmart and of course they don't have any more and now I will have to get a different brand and spend more money!!"
2,Had to return within a week,"I bought this about two weeks ago, it worked reasonably well for about a week. During that one week I was able to listen, mostly without interference, to audio books in the car. After this week, however, I tried to turn it on and got a ""File System Corrupted Error"". After a little research on the net it seems this is a fairly common error with this type of lyra player. I ended up having to return the device to the company for an exchange and to add insult to injury, had to pay for the shipping to return it.I would not recommend buying this product. Spend a few more dollars and get an mp3 player from a more established company. I'd imagine the reliability will be better."
1,Great price not so great product.,"Just got and it was DOA ""file system corrupted"" I read the reviews and bought it anyway. The screen also has a residue left from the protective layer that will not come off? I will give it one more try."
3,Works Well,I have had no real problems with this item. Thought i had a problem and called the customer service number for this product and talked with a very helpful rep who solved my problem.
4,Pretty Good Purchase,"I bought this RCA MP3 player even after all the bad reviews. My daughter has a different RCA MP3 Player and has not had any problems with it. Mine works just fine, I didn't have any problems transfering my music and it sounds great in the car. My only complaint is that is does not seem to hold a charge. I probably only get around 3 hours or so before the battery goes dead. This is fine for short trips, but it would be worthless on a long trip. But overall it works great."
1,Don't buy this one,"Problems:* Battery never charged completely .I tried to charge the battery more than 12 hours .Note that the unit comes with an internal battery (not replaceable).* Cheap material ( rotating dial, unit etc )* Squeaking sound when accessing folder or playing files.My suggestion: do not buy even if it is below $40 bucks. If you think you are the luckiest guy or blessed with a fortune, give a try"
4,Lucky with my Lyra,"My Lyra has worked without any problems for a couple of months. I wanted to get into an mp3 player at low cost to see if I would really listen to it very much. This was by far the best bang for the buck. (now with a $[...] rebate it's under $[...]!!!)I decided to use only my Windows Media Player software for song loading and management to keep things as simple as possible. It is wonderful to have so much music in a small package. I got some high quality Sony earbuds for greater comfort and sound quality.My only complaints: the ""FM Transmitter / charger"" is clearly described as a transmitter only, with no charging function in the users guide (false advertising) and the battery lasts about 5 hours."
1,Stay away,"It was nice when it got here and while it worked, but it died after about a month. It seems that these things simply do not last. I'm sending mine back for a refund."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I bought the LYRA 2763FM because it was compatible with Windows 98 & it came with a car adapter. After using for about 2 weeks, the unit crashed & wouldn't boot up. So I sent it back. The service rep said to send back everything that came with it- all accessories, including the car adapter. After 4 more phone calls to Thomson (RCA's service provider) ... not to mention 2 months. I received a different model that wasn't compatible with my computer AND NO CAR ADAPTER. After 3 more calls to Thomson, I've repeatedly been told that the new unit they sent me doesn't include a car adapter.Thomson has kept the car adapter I already paid for and sent back to them - as instructed by them & they won't replace it.BOTTOM LINE - Thomson's service is terrible. They don't listen to you as a customer and don't care about making things right."
1,Worthless,"I bought this set for my wife for Christmas. It worked well and she enjoyed it for about a month before getting the fatal ""file system corrupted"" message. RCA Tech support ignores most requests and when they do answer one, their advice is useless. She now has a very expensive paperweight. I've purchased my last RCA product. At least there is a class action suit in the works. (The transmitter still works well)."
1,Unfortunate mishap on ehalf of RCA,"Something must have gone wrong that day my Lyra came out of the factory.Great accessory, the FM transmitter i mean. But as of the rest? Well 3 weeks into it and i had to format it with all my songs in it.First it started with mixing the songs up. Out of the blue while listening to a song suddenly it would play a different tune just for a few seconds and then return playing the first one. Afterwards it got worse it would say ""file not found"",get stuck or it wouldn't even start up. Needless to say i consider this as a piece of ""great idea gone wrong..."" to put it MILD....."
1,Bad product. Stay Away,Mine wouldn't be recognized by windows most of the times. I had to reboot the machine in order for it to be recognized. When copying music some tracks would randomly appear twice. The wheel has a feel of cheap bicycle tyres. I returned mine.
2,for concerned consumer,"do not buy this product! It will not last for more than 2-3 months. I bought one and it lasted a week, i then sent that back to get a new one, and the next one did not even last 2 full months. What both of mine read was that the file system was corrupted, and after that you can no longer use it. I admit that while it was working it was nice to use, but for those looking for a cheap alternative for an ipod, keep looking because this product is obviously defective by design. For those of you looking to get lucky and recieve one that will not be defective, that simply will not happen."
2,Don't buy RCA,"I liked this player-at least while I was able to use it. It was compact, had a nice display and easy navigation. It died with the ""File System Corrupted"" message barely a month after I got it, however. I promptly sent it back to RCA and waited... I eventually called for an update and got a ""It will ship in 7-10 days"" reply. So I waited another two weeks. I finally called again and was told it was out of stock and they just ordered it the day before. (Remember this was more than a week after it was supposed to be shipped.) They didn't feel the need to inform me of this. I've already set aside time to call RCA again in a few weeks, as their level of information sharing is clearly substandard. I'm not holding out much hope of ever actually receiving a replacement mp3 player."
1,DON'T BUY!!!!!,I had this for a week and it said file system corrupted!!! I had also bought a 1 GB RCA mp3 player before that did the same thing. RCA'S ARE JUNK!!!
2,"Great price, but a major problem....","I was very excited about this product, but I froze it up within a week. (I varied a lot between the two modes of media drive and hard drive...can't remember the technical terms on this...I think this is why it froze) Tech support said it had to be returned under warranty. I researched this and found it to be a somewhat common problem. The file system was corrupted and I could not get the device recognized by Windows.It was great while it worked, but luckily I could return it. I bought another because I was afraid this would happen again out of warranty...."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this product after looking online at various other brands. It seemed as though this product was a good value (5 MB for $99). I quickly found out why it was priced so low, it was a piece of junk. After 3 days, the first one that I ordered would not stay charged. When I contacted Amazon, they promptly sent a replacement. However, the replacement displayed the message, ""File System Corrupted!"" the first time I turned it on. I am returning this product for a refund and will NEVER purchase an RCA product again."
1,Poor quality MP3 player,"We thought we got a real good deal on this MP3 player. It has locked up twice on us with no way to restart it or shut it off. It just started working again, but not until 12 hours later. The ""bonus"" FM transmitter is a piece of junk. It barely works and you have to turn the volume way up on the stereo to even hear it, even then there is a lot of static. Once you turn it off, beware of the volume on the stereo because it is turned up so high from the transmitter, it will blast your eardrums. I would appreciate a replacement player that does not lock up. I can do without the transmitter."
1,"If you have a problem with RCA products, I hope you can get a refund.","Recently we have tried 3 different RCA products and had problems with all 3. When you call RCA Customer service, you will end up talking to someone in India or the Philippines who barely speaks English and doesn't really care about your problems.We bought one of these RCA MP3 players and contrary to what it says, they will not reliably play WMA and MP3 songs mixed together. We had been unable to get an answer from RCA as to why and whether there is a fix. We were lucky enough to be able to return the unit for a refund."
4,very nice mp3,"At first, some might be confused with this unit, but after learning that you need to press and hold the toggle switch in when you connect to your pc, this is a very easy mp3 to load with songs. You just open the file folder at my computer and drag and drop your song files-very simple.it has ample disc space for plenty of songs and I was very surprised with the quality of sound. The fm transmitter is a great added feature and very simple to use.I was very happy with this purchase and would recommend this unit as it is not as expensive as others but just as good as most."
4,rca 2763fm,"good mp3 large capacity great price pros, cons somewhat difficult to manouver, drains battries quickly with large capacity recommend rechargables"
2,Poorly written,"Backhouse tries to give a brief, accessible summary of the history of economics, but the book is so dry that it is almost unreadable. Although Backhouse brings in some social and political background, for the most part he's just listing people and theories. His explanations, designed for non-technical readers, are not mathematically complex, and do avoid unneccesary terminology. But they're written in a choppy, condensed style, without illumination from real-world examples. The result is just not compelling reading. And his decision to take his history back to Greek times doesn't really work: the pre-modern thinkers omitted from most standard histories aren't consciously writing about economics. Rather, Backhouse is inferring economic assumptions from literary or ethical discussions. This discussion is potentially interesting (although it suffers from the same flaws as the rest of the book), but not really the same subject-matter as the conventional history of economics."

1,"draggling, dull, despriting, devoid of a good story","Didn't believe there could be a worse film than U-571 until I saw this one.Scenes are pretty good. Costuming very period. They used a real submarine and they used real germans.Acting is very low quality. Plot is dragging and dull. Diolog just dies. Spoken devoid of spirit. Other than the German captain and his exxo, none of the characters is really interesting.Really pathetic this one."
1,true story,"Okay, last night I rented Ocean's 12 and went to my buddy's house to watch it. I get there. We play some Bocce ball. I kick some arse. Then we retire into the house to eat some turtle ice cream and watch the movie. Too bad his dad was watching 'In Enemy Hands' and wouldn't let us throw in Ocean's 12. I have to say, the prologue is the only good thing about this movie. Some very impressive world war 2 film stock. But then the movie starts. Within minutes you know this film has nothing going for it. There is no structure, the acting is horrible, there is no sense of drama, and there's a continuity error in the first shot. I want to know whos nephew got to direct this film. Thanks for trying, but no.......just...no.PS- Don't watch this film. I bet if they did a study, they would find that watching this film actually takes about 12 minutes off of your life span."
4,Nice pendant,A pretty cool pendant. Looks good but it bendable. I'm a big fun of GN'R so i like it anyways.
5,Clip Picture Frames,"Dennis Daniels Glass Clip Picture FrameFor several weeks I was in search of ""the perfect"" photo frame that was attractive yet would not distract from a photograph I had enlarged. I stumbled upon this ""clip"" frame while doing a general search for an odd frame size (12x18). This glass clip picture frame caught my eye and I decided to try it. I am very pleased with this frame. This is how photographs should be displayed........frameless! My photo stands out for itself and does not look like it's surrounded by a piece of furniture on the wall. I will definitely purchase more. The only downside was that it did not come with any hardware to hang on the wall. However, this was easily resolved by buying a package of mirror clips/screws at a local hardware store for under $2."
5,THERES NOTHING LIKE JANET!,"HOW CAN THIS NOT GET 5 STARS. NO FEMALE (DEBATABLE MADONNA)HAS BROUGHT THIS VIDEO AGE TO TV SCREENS LIKE JANET. THOUGH NOT THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED SINGER HER ENERGY AND VIDEOS ARE ALL WATCHABLE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THIS DVD ALSO FEATURES THE UNRELEASED WHOOPS NOW! BUT DONT BUY IT FOR THAT, ITS ALL CLIPS AND NOTHING REALLY SPECIAL. BUY IT FOR ALL THE OTHER CLASSICS SUCH AS WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR ME LATLEY AND WATCH JANET GROW AND MATURE FROM THE GIRL WE ALL LOVED TO THE WOMAN WE ALL LOVE"
5,Let Janet Take You On A Escapade,"With This DVD You Can See Janet Grow Up.. Even Doh It Was Missing A Video From Her Design Of A Decade CD ""Twenty Foreplay""..

4,design of a great career,"this is a collection of music videos from janet jackson in her prime and at her creative peak. I only wish more videos from the janet album were featured and that miss you much was extended, but I know that this is representative of mostly her A&M work and barely her Virgin work. My favourite videos are nasty, control, pleasure principle and all the videos from rhythm nation as well as the multicultural runaway. Get it today and see what janet did before britney and those kids came along"
5,Design of a Decade,"Design of a Decade is Janet Jackson at her best. It scans her best songs and features the videos from her greatest hits. It doesn't get any better than All Right With Me (Cab Calloway, Cyd Cherrise, the Nicholas Brothers,etc). There is good music, great dancing and Janet from young girl to young woman."
5,Great vintage Janet,"If you're a Janet Jackson fan this is a must have. I was not able to locate a DVD or Blu Ray copy so I got the VHS. That alone makes me appreciate technology. None the less it has every single video it promises. Sit back, relax, and enjoy a trip down memory lane. See the excitement of a young Janet on A&M records, taking Control and making a name for herself. Have fun!"
3,disappointing sound,"I like many of these songs and videos. I was extremely disappointed when I received this dvd; it was only then that I discovered it was not remixed for 5.1 surround sound. Without that, this dvd is not much better than a VHS cassette. There are no bonuses included. Most disappointing soundwise was the audio for ""When I Think Of You"". At least most of the stereo tracks are well balanced, but this cut has Janet's vocal buried too far in the mix, with too much reverb, and overall this track sounds a bit flat and warbled. Perhaps they couldn't find a decent quality master of the video for this song. Another reason why this disc SHOULD have included a surround mix.As to the performances, well, if you like Janet (and I do) you'll like these videos. You probably have seen them all numerous times already, so you know what you're getting. I was particularly pleased to see ""Nasty"" again, which probably contains the best dancing of all of the videos in this collection."
3,two step folding stool,"I like the compact/folding size, it fits in my 6"" cabinet next to the stove. I'm 5' 2"" and I can reach my upper cabinets now. Only flaw I see is it slides on my kitchen floor, I had to get rubber stickies and glued them on the bottom to prevent sliding/injury. Whoever buys it, see if it slides on the floor first to know if it'll come out from underneath you when you are on it."
4,"a Comprehensive, Quality Work","Although it's a fairly slim volume, its breadth is quite wide, including the standard periods like ancient greece and medieval france, but also some less-than-standard, such as medieval ireland and islamic spain. On the one hand, the best thing about this work is all non-English works are included in parallel-text format, giving the original language with a translation; on the other hand, my only complaint is that the Middle English texts are not translated fully, and only certain difficult words are translated, which not only makes the page look fragmentary, it also overestimates how easily the originals would be able to be read. Overall, a very worthwhile volume."
3,"ANSWER to Wayne W. Wei ""VampSalyer"" (New York)",""" The songs are great , September 2, 2005Reviewer: Wayne W. Wei ""VampSalyer"" (New York) - See all my reviewsThis soundtrack is not bad, but it missed a few good ones.I want to know what song was that live band was playing in santa monica when eric and the buys entering the skating ring.""In answer to your question, if you truly have the soundtrtack you'll find that Seein Red by Unwritten Law was the song played while the guys entered the demo area and while they skated it. The song played while Jason ""Wee Man"" Acuña ran around was a song being played by Blindside."
4,Plz help me!,"Hi,I wanna ask to all sountrack fans if they can help. There's a bit where Eric Rivers is working in the fast food and he's wearing that funny sausage costume. When he sees Jamie there's a kind of romantic song and i wanna find out abt tat song. I've been hearing it in other teen movies such as ""Not another teen movie"". If anyone knows this song can u mail me on my e-mail: (...)Thnx pals,Kwaish"
3,Goin down on it,"Actually there is two Hot Action Cop songs in this movie, the first song played that starts out with ""one on one, two one one, three on one, and one for fun . . ."" is a Hot Action Cop song. that is the one on the soundtrack"
2,MISSING TRACKS,"this cd is missing the song""line and sinker"" by billy talent amongst others.i think u need to recheck the cd and make sure u got it all.u r also missing tracks from the eurotrip soundtrack like the chemical brothers.RECHECK YOUR STUFF!"
3,bizarre,This movie was so random and out there at points i couldn't believe it was allowed to be put into theatres. Then I noticed one thing: there are hot guys. So I'm not complaining. The soundtrack is mediocre.
2,"Ack, I Hate MTV","Congrats, MTV has successfully marketed one of the few things that I enjoy. Skating is not meant to be marketed as propaganda for capitalistic gain. People are stupid to buy into this. I only saw the movie for one reason, it was free, and because of the smoking chicks in it. Looks like pro-skateboarders are sell outs too, wow I'm shocked.The only reason this cd gets 2 stars is because of Less Then Jake and Sublime. I don't know what they were smoking when they agreed to let their songs be on this album, but it must have been some strong stuff. Ska and Punk are quickly being destroyed by pop-culture. Let me quickly refer you to a small list of real punk bands:RancidOperation IvyAnti-FlagAFILess Then JakeRed TapeNoFXPennywiseRage Against the MachineDRISex PistolsDead Kennedy'sDrop Kick Murphy's, and so forthSo do yourself a favor and go pick up Anti-Flag's ""The Terror State"", or an old Operation Ivy cd, and fight the majority."
5,Question! Desperate to know!,Ok; Eric Dustin Matt and Sweet Lou arrive in SAnta Monica at the skate demo. The movie shows the badn that plays there. Who are they and waht is the song calleD?!
4,great sound track,"This cd has many great tunes , but if you seen the movie they left some great ones out. Still a great soundtrack."
4,Whats the Song??,"Ok...they miss the jimmy wilson bus and clean up the porto potties...sitting on the stands right when eric has enough of it and realizes his dreams might be crushed...theres a song playing in the background, i have no clue what it is, when i first heard it it sounded like radiohead to me, but it only lasts for a few seconds then goes into a strong instrumental...if anyone knows what this song is please let me know!!! Thanks!!!"
2,grind,"first off, it was a stupid teen movie. not that i minded since i like those types of movies - hot guys, hot girls, and a catchy soundtrack. that's ALL IT WAS. 99.99% of soundtracks are mainstream music. not ""real"" anything. stop trying to justify your music tastes by calling it ""real punk"" or ""pseudo punk"" just because some idiot called you out for listening to the cd. my favorite bands are the clash and the beastie boys, but i have j-pop programmed into my ipod. get over yourself. everyone's ""sold out"" and we're all just a product of mass-media and the age of instant gratification.in terms of the actual soundtrack, the music sounds better as part of the movie than coming out of your stereo. personally, i think there are better songs/bands out there to spend money on. my suggestion - listen to the music bytes and then get the songs you like from itunes. buying the whole album isn't worth it."
1,SUCKS!!!!!!!!!TRULY!!!!!!,"I REALLY LIKED THE MUSIC IN THE MOVIE, BUT MOST OF IT WASN'T EVEN IN THE DAMN SOUNDTRACK, SO WHY BOTHER? THEY REALLY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING BY MAKING THIS PIECE OF CRAP SOUNDTRACK. STAY AWAY--TRUST ME!"
4,The songs are great,"This soundtrack is not bad, but it missed a few good ones.I want to know what song was that live band was playing in santa monica when eric and the buys entering the skating ring."
2,Awkward Writing Style Undermines Delivery,Conscience of the Beagle (1993) by Patricia Anthony - 201 pages - rating: 6/10Four top notch investigators are dispatched from earth to a peaceful colonial world to capture the terrorists responsible for a series of deadly attacks.The ideas are fresh and the feel is unique. The characters are well developed and the action moves along at a good pace.The author does have a problem however with sentence/paragraph structure and as a result the prose comes off as jerky and confusing. This problem continues through out the entire book and almost totally ruins what would otherwise have been a compelling story.An excellent ending and the best sex scene ever in a science fiction novel save Conscience of the Beagle from a dismal 4/10 rating.Claus Kellermann2006 Aug 5Sci_Fi_Researcher@yahoo.com
4,Oracle Streams explained,"Maybe I'm just dense, but reading and re-reading the Oracle documentation on Streams just did not do it for me. This was the only book I could find that appeared to have substantial detailed descriptions of how to use this product. I was not disappointed. It got me over the hump. He does assume a fair amount of understanding when he gets to downstream capture, but by the time I had worked out regular capture I had enough familiarity to piece it together. I have bought a lot of different books on Oracle; this was my first from Rampant publishing, so I was a little concerned, but it proved itself worth the money."
5,Really quite good,"I disagree that this book is a rehash of the manuals. Once you get into it; it's clear that Tumma has really good, really real experience with streams. I bought his book after hearing him at IOUG where he makes it clear that he knows what he is doing. Just his tips on Streanms pitfalls are enough to justify the cost of this book."
2,High Level Overview - not for administrators,"I'm glad this book was only $18 because if I'd paid more than that for it I would have been extremely upset. As it is, I have just reminded myself of why I tend to buy books for work from well know authors and publishers. This book is fine if you want to find out what Oracle Streams does, at a very vague, high level; anyone seeking to find out how to design, configure or implement a real Streams based application is wasting their time. The Oracle documentation is well written, relatively complete, and provides full feature documentation. This book provides nothing useful."
2,very unordered,"It is good and precise,it explain all things need for Stream replication but it is very unorderd + lack of step by step example and don't specify which part is for Oracle 9i and which part is for oracle 10g"
1,pass it over ....,don't bother with this book. Read Oracle documentation before this book. There are mistakes in the scripts and user to run them.
4,Clear Understanding of Oracle Streams,This book was a tremendous help to our shop as we deployed Streams to fulfill our replication requirements. Highly recommend it to anyone seeking to learn more about streams.
1,Not surprised by this book,I bought this book after reading Oracle documentation for couple of days.Completely disappointed by it.Only basic coverage which is not enough even to create sample replication.90% of the materials are just copy/paste (with small rephrase) from Oracle Documentation.
3,OK. Not Great,This is a good book. It could have been better if author had included step-by-step instructions and more screen shots. Good for beginners.
3,Good for a sequel,"Looks better produced, more dollars spent, brought back the originalcast after the 2nd sequel lost jody. I prefer the hardtops to the convertiblecuda's. Phantasm could be remade today, and expanded into somethingreally viable and for its day its one of my favourite horror/sci fi classic filmsway ahead of its time."
2,Not as good as the first one.,"Here's a secret. Angus Scrimm, the tall guy in all of the movies, is really LARRY GUY. I don't know why he hides his real identity? He was a customer when I managed a video store in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, this version isn't as good as the first, and has new characters. The second one was passable to watch once, but not anymore, although they probably made money at the Box-Office. The newness of the idea has worn off although those flying daggers are still used and look gory."
2,"Hail, Hail, The Gang's All Here!","PhantasmIII is a barely passable sequel that is probably only for the die hard fans of the genre. Don Coscarelli is able to reunite all of the ""stars"" from the original, but the story is all over the place. If you are a ""phan"" of this series then it is a must have. To the uninitiated however, it is a confusing mess."
3,Decent flick with color-coded spheres,"Not as interesting as the original or part IV, but worth watching. The ending sets up #IV nicely."
1,THE BALL WAS DROPPED!!!!!,Watch Phantasm 1 2 and 3 and 4 in that order and it's clear how badly the later 2 suck compared to one and 2 and as horror movies on there own. They shoudn't have even made a sequel without James Legros and the girl. Legros is a better Mike then Baldwin will ever be. We saw Baldwin as a kid and that was fine but kicking Legros out for 3 and 4 and putting back Baldwin was a bad move.Finally as much as I loved Reg he dies in number 2 so no continuity and a serious lack of seriousness make 3 and 4 poor poor sequels.In Hellraiser you ever see Pinhead crack a joke with any human characters/victims or do they purpously try to make you laugh no thats why it's a horror! After wathing 3 and 4 you'll feel that a sphere just drilled through your brain!!!
5,Phantasm 3,Any Phantasm movie is a classic film. If you like horror movies I highly suggest these series of movies.
3,Phantasm III : Lord of the Dead,"Yes The Tall Man is back as is the original mikey from Part 1,however the movie seems to take a approach more to action and some humor than horror, Part 2 was scarier and Part 1 of course even more so. Still one of the creepiest franchises."
4,Pretty solid third sequel!,"I can pretty honestly say that ""Phantasm"" along with ""Hellraiser, Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th"" were the last of the good horror films. Part 3 to this installment of Don Coscarelli's masterpiece was pretty good i will say. But, where in the heck is part 2 to this installment. I can't understand for the life of me why it was never released on dvd. It was one of the better ones. I guess somebody at some point will wake up and get it released one day. I still have yet to see part 4. But i will get around to purchasing it real soon."
3,Bill Thornbury and A. Michael Baldwin are back.,"The film starts cleverly where the earlier film, Phantasm II ended. A. Michael Baldwin is back as ""Michael"". So are Reggie Bannister and Angus Scrimm as ""The Tall Man"". Bill Thornbury as ""Jody"" makes special appearances fifteen years after the first Phantasm film in 1979. I won't reveal any of the plot because Phantasm films are always a surprise. Kevin Connors plays ""Tim"".Followed byPhantasm IV: Oblivion(1998)."
4,Great Value,Great for Yo Gabba Gabba fans for a great price. The toddlers love it--there are so many episodes. Favorite songs are included and we discovered new favorites. Great for people like us who do not subscribe to Nick Jr.
5,Gabba Gabba,This arrived in perfect condition. This is another of part of my grandson's Christmas gifts. He opened it on Christmas and was already watching and enjoying the DVD.
3,Edited =(,"I loved this film as a child, treasuring the ""taped from the TV"" version well into my twenties. When I finally purchased the video, I was disappointed to realize that the VHS is edited, eliminating some transitional dialogue and two songs (""jail break"" and the one where Jack and Mary are singing in jail). It is still a charming story that will be passed along for generations to come, but I will be sure to hold on to the ""tv version"" that has every aspect of the film. It would be terrific if ORION released a DVD version of this film with all of the uncut scenes in it!"
2,Childhood memory,"This is a movie that my children endlessly watched back in the early 90's and I purchased it simply for a trip down memory lane!! However, this movie really is awful !!!!!!!"
2,I love this movie!,"It's getting 2 stars only because I love this movie soooooo much. I had been looking for it for a while because I first got it when I was little, through McDonalds that had been giving them out and I had since lost it. The picture quality is crap. It is horrible, and I am not a picky person when it comes to picture quality but this movie is really un-watchable!"
3,"Babymush, Blah Blah","i'm a big fan of any movie based on Victor Herbert's 'Toyland' but as far as versions go this is the most blah and pedestrian of all the adaptations. it's also the most babyish. but strangely kids will probably like this one better than the superior classic adaptations. kids are weird that way. personally i prefer the classic adaptations by Disney and the Laurel & Hardy comedy.this ""Toyland' version is sooooo made for television and pretty underwhelming. Toyland itself looks like a re-used set and the original songs aren't as good as the Victor Herbert operetta. the storyline is also really silly and, boy oh boy, don't get me started on those cheap little go-karts.this version is for babies. interesting to note it has become somewhat of a rarity and hard to find other than VHS. this film is a real holiday classic to some and a fond memory. i think that's overrating this babyfood drivel. still i find it to be a good, funny, so-bad-its-good trip and i'm kind of fond of it too."
1,The ORIGINAL (TV Version) is BETTER!,"If you have the original television version I would pay a lot for a copy (gregorystefan@gmail.com)- When released on video ORION cut out 30 minutes!!! If you grew up on this movie and are buying this for nostalgic sake, this will be very disappointing :'("
4,Love this movie...,"I remembered watching this movie when i was younger, decided to buy for my daughter to watch. She enjoyed it as much as i did."
1,What is the THESIS?,"First of all, the expert philosophers they use are actually theologians or bible scholars. Second, these scholars are defining postmodernism as a suspicion of all absolute truth claims. Then the brothers in the documentary begin to disparage the church and state that they believe a church is not needed. A post-modernistic view, a worldview of individualism.On to the editing and the quality of the movie. Why use cameramen that cannot keep the camera steady? Then have to edit the film as the movie Seven to cover up those mistakes?This is a shoddy movie at best. Very one sided and for those that praise it, either you are related to the film makers or you truly believe the lies that have been fed to you. Read or watch something that is not biased to learn both sides and come to an opinion."
4,Its Playboy,"Its Playboy, the classic men's Magazine. Great article and Great Pictures. A true view of Americana. A one of a kind magazine."
5,Mag,It is for a guy nothing much more needs to be said. All men like to look at women. It will not hurt anyone.
4,playboy,"playboy has great storys, great information and lets not forget beautiful women. whats not to like a very classy magazine"
3,meh.,"Playboy was awesome like 15 years ago when I used to sneak peaks at my dads.But now its awkward, if i'm going to look at porn, there's much better ways to do it, and if i'm going to read a magazine there much better magazines.2 Hot chicks, 1200 s***** articles, that's every playboy in a nutshell.I might get it again if I ever have boys to give them something dirty but tame without unleashing the full fury of the internet on them. I'd probably just leave it half hidden so that they could find it but still think they were getting away with something."
2,Thanks for the Subtlety,"The magazine itself isn't bad, nothing ground breaking but can offer an interesting read at times. When I receive a product like this I expect the packaging to be subtle without PLAYBOY labeled everywhere. And for the most part it is. That was until about 7 months into my subscription when I started to receive renewal notices.The first renewal request I received was titled ""URGENT - 3rd notice"" with Playboy clearly written on it. Every couple weeks I receive a new one, including my most recent that came in a bright yellow envelope with ""SUSPENSION ADVISORY"" across the entire front of it and Playboy written up in the corner. I understand the intent is to attract attention to it, but I would at least hope they would carry the same considerations in packaging their magazine to the renewal requests.I canceled with 4 months left on my subscription just to stop the renewal request spam. I won't be subscribing again."
3,"I read the articles, seriously","The magazine offers interesting articles more often than many people imagine. Especially when it comes to science of sexuality, their choices of writers are good and fun.On the other hand, the photos of young naked girls are repetitive and boring, how many blond girls with artificial lips and boobs can you enjoy looking at? They look all the same, and worst, so digitally ""improved"" they don't look human most of the time. Too much airbrush work made them look like a clone game character.To me, the most interesting section in the magazine is the Q & A from the readers, there are so many questions about human behaviors, normal or not. I learned so much about ourselves and what's really going on in the modern America. The answers are most often very specific and helpful, wise and tongue-in cheek fun."
4,"More expensive then ordering it direct, but arrived quickly","I ordered this for my husband as a Christmas gift and based on all the previous reviews I ordered it in early Novemeber to arrive in Mid to late December... well it arrived less than 4 weeks later.On a side note, the magazine insert for has the 1 year subscription for only $12."
3,HORRIBLE!!,"I got this subscription for a friend and they haven't even received half of the issues. They claim it is a ""post-office"" issue but they are getting the other 2 subscriptions I got them.What a fail gift...Not recommended unless they can fix this issue"
5,Playboy magazine,The most convenient and least expensive way to continue my 40 year subscription. I will continue renew this way as long as it is offered.
4,11 issues a year?,I don't know about you guys but I'm pretty annoyed that they send us the dec/jan issue 2 years in a row. I feel a bit ripped off. I pay for 12 and get 11. If I bought a 12 pack and got 11 beers I'd be taking that sheit back. Don't rip off your subscribers Heff or whoever it is that is running Playboy now. The magazine is still good although not as good as it was a few years back. It should be improving to stay competitive with all of the free content out there. I hope someone at playboy reads this and makes it right with their subscribers.
4,Still an American Classic,"Better spreads can be found elsewhere, but Playboy is a great magazine, brand, and American Icon."
2,disappointed,"I am a bit disappointed. I realize there was a warning that subscriptions take some time (6-10 weeks) to fill, but it has now been over 7 weeks and I recently received an email stating I can expect the first issue on April 24th. What the heck?! That's over 12 weeks. So at this point I still can not review my actual order."
3,Be careful,"I'll update my review as I find out more, but somehow I ordered this and got the digital copy instead of the Print version. I wouldn't have ordered this if I knew it was the digital version."
5,Picture Perfect.,Very easy to renew. No fuss no muss.Will use service again.I have used this service for other publications.
4,Good magazine.,"Is exactly as I expected. I also get Penthouse magazine, but they seem to concentrate too much on the aroused vaginal entrance and costs a lot more."
2,Same old,"Playboy magazine has turned into a mundane, compacted version of itself. The same articles, the same products that no one can afford, and the same photoshopped images. Besides the very few celebrities, I literally cannot tell the women in the magazine apart. Playmate of the month might as well be the same person every month. No one would know. Or would they? Have I found out Playboys new dark secret? Has Old Man Hef lost his mind finally?"
1,"Overrated, boring, behind the times, irrelevant","Ask yourself this: If this magazine were identical in every way except had a different brandname, would you buy it? NO. It's full of ads, boring pictures that you see on cable tv, crummy and pretentious articles and not much else. This magazine was great in its hayday. Now its irrelevant and doesn't do any one thing particularly well."
1,Too much time for first magazine and still waiting !!!!!,Too much time for first magazine and still waiting !!!!! I hope it comes quickly. In the meantime patience ..........................
2,Where did monthly issues go?,They are sending issues every other month right now. Not cool. This was a nice magazine until they switched it and didn't bother to reimburse anyone who paid for a years worth of issues.
1,Playboy magazine,I paid right away a year ago now and they haven't even sent me the first issue!! Now they are trying to bill me for another year without sending me a timing warning or anything. I have notified them of this before and 'it will be worked on' but nothing was changed.
1,Hassle,"This is NOT an auto-renewal. ORdered it once and although they said they couldn't charge it again, they did. Cost me $200."
2,TAKES TOO LONG TO RECEIVE,"I ordered this on August 31, 2010 as a gift. It will not be delivered until 11/2010!!! This is outrageous. Why on Earth would it take so long? Will not purchase another magazine subscription through Amazon again."
1,Cannot cancel order,I tried to cancel the order 1 day after placing it. I had thought my subscription had run out when it really was just late. Totally impossible to cancel
1,come on...,I still have yet to recieve my first issue. I've recieved 2 of another magazine that I ordered at the same time.
2,Where is this ?,"The latest date that this was supposed to be shipped was SEP17 , I ordered this in July , where is the product , who knows ."
3,OK,"this magazine disappointed me a bit. Since I moved into this country a few months back, I thought lets give the men's entertainment magazine a try here.but, this one just doesn't stand by the name ""Playboy"" has earned through out the world"
2,good shiter read,"Pics are OK..penthouse reveals the true beauty of a woman...Playboy is just a tease at best. Good articles though! I like it when I sit upon my ""throne""..:)"
2,I Still Read the Articles...Sometimes,"PLAYBOY just isn't what it was even as soon as ten years ago. Major celebrities don't pose for it; the ones who do are of the ""Oh, I remember her"" variety, the interviews aren't revelatory, and ""The PLAYBOY Forum"" has been supplanted by The Huffington Post, Daily Kos, et al. ""Grapevine"" is a pathetic collection of six-month old paparazzi nipple-slip photos, the fiction is just OK, and the fashion pages are nothing compared to what you'll find in Details or Nylon Guys.Personally I'm also tired of seeing Marilyn Monroe pop up in almost every issue. I get that Hef has never gotten over her but I'm sure most of today's male readership just don't care.I'm something of a traditionalist. I like holding the magazine in my hands and turning the pages, much like I enjoy reading my morning paper with hot coffee. After nearly ten years it appears that is the only thing keeping PLAYBOY coming to my home."
2,Not in the best condition- Frustrating Book,"We used this as a discussion piece for a philosophy club at my college. Each chapter was a teaser to the answer, then ""swoosh"" no answer was given. The writer did warn that there maybe no right answer to the ills of institutions and our current ""democracy"". But reading a whole book on ideas that won't solidify was as frustrating as getting to third base and then your Mom catches you in the act."
2,Very disappointed on this DVD!!!,"don't get me wrong, i like Chevelle and ""Wonder What's Next"" is one of the best albums among those thousands of CD i've own. so when i knew they had a live DVD release, i just went to the shop and bought it.The thing is, they are not tight playing live, their performance is bad and boring, songs like ""Family System"", ""Don't Fake This"", ""the Red"", ""Send the Pain Below"", ""Until You're Reformed"" are badly performed, and are ruined by their fallen-apart performance, i love thier album much more than their live, which are much tighter and much more creative."
3,Good Live Atmosphere.. just not Great Music,"So the crowd could have been a little more into it, but the venue was small, so that's no big deal. The video and sound quality is good, and the film is well directed. However it seems as if we may not be watching great musicians. The music isn't great, but there are some good songs in this performance. I don't regret the buy, mainly because I'm a fan of concerts on DVD... but definitely buy The Red Hot Chili Peppers Live at Slane before this. That DVD is beautiful. ;-)"
1,Plain Old Boring,"Ya, there albums may be good, but Chevelle aren't the type to put on a good rock live concert. If you wanna see a awesome rock show, check out Evanescence's new release ""Anywhere But Home,"" which is a live show of them in Paris."
3,good album,"good album, if you like metal you will like this one. get it and see if you like it. maybe it will come out on cds"
4,Best of Russ Taff,"He is the most inspiring gospel singer that really drives home the powerful feeling and joy of sharing our love for our Lord Jesus in such a special way. After watching this paticular DVD, It gave me more personal joy for many reasons. One being I suffer from Depression and to hear his story is so incredible."
2,Not a very satisfying read on Kindle,"This was the first comic I downloaded to the Kindle Fire I got for Christmas, and I have to say I was pretty disappointed. I didn't realize it lacked the panel view feature, and if any book could benefit from it this one could. The art and the story are pretty good, with a fun and campy 80's slasher movie kind of story line, and the kind of art you would expect to see in Image books like Spawn. But the way the panels are laid out makes it a very difficult read on a Kindle screen. Lots of zooming required. So if they ever upgrade it with the panel view feature, it might be fantastic. Until then, you might want spend the extra couple bucks to stick with the old school paperback version for a more enjoyable reading experience."
4,Bought as a gift.,"I purchased this comic book as a gift for my little brother, but he absolutely loved it and had finished it within a couple of days!"
5,Fantastic,"The best french voice of the century!A wonderful CD for a very beautiful girl.Listen the magic ""Cassé"" and the others tittles of the CD and enjoy!"
2,there are better French singers !,"I don't think Nolwenn is all that. I truly believe there are more talented people out there (in ""la France"") than this ""reality tv"" divette. Most of the songs on this CD are very boring. I am NOT saying the girl doesnt have a voice, just saying that there are more talented people in the same category. It's kinda like... why get Walmart chocolate when u can get Godiva? Why get a Kelly Clarkson CD when you can buy Mariah or Whitney? I suggest you look around and look for real francophone divas like Liane Foly, Maurane, Native, and the French Cds by Celine Dion. These women sing like they know what they're talking about, and their lyrics are MUCH MUCH more elaborate."
1,Shame Shame Shame,"I feel so ashamed being French to believe people in the world think she's a star or representative of French Music. There are so many talented singers or bands in France. She's just a marketing toy created by one of the worst concept of reality shows... you should rather listen to people like Etienne Daho, Mickey 3D, Indochine, Noir Désir..."
3,"Incredible voice, bad album !!","Nolwenn comes from the most popular musical reality show in france (Star academy). She won the 2nd season. This girl has a lot of talent, an incredible voice and she works hard, the problem is that she had to prepared this album in less than 2 months because of the rules of the show. This album is a part of the prize that she won and I don't think she really told her opinion about it. I know that she writes songs but I don' t think that she wrote some for this album. The songs are kind of old-fashioned, lyrics are totally boring and melodies aren't good. I hope and I am sure that her next album will be great if she's the only person on it and not directed by ""star academy"""
5,nolwenn leroy the best,"this young artist is quite simply espoustouflante, it has a voice sublimates, exceptional, a rare pearl and moreover is very very beautiful, I advise you his album which is a little marvel, you will not be disappointed we are much in France has to believe in it I wish of any heart qu it has career qu it deserves and qu it will make career on your premise that would be fantastic, I ask you m to excuse D to write in French I know your language very little but J likes nolwenn as well as I wanted wanted to make you share my admiration in spite of the language and the borders claudyJ found a translator"
1,empty.....,"I don't like Star academy,and i don't really like the way this album was made...I think the people, who have left reviews before,is from her Fan club,because there is a lot of lies...For example: one said that Nolwenn Leroy is a big star in Europe,that's so untrue,and another says that she is ""the voice"",but she is not...There is others artists who are so much better than her,for example:Alanis Morissette,Emiliana torrini,and in France you have Patricia Kaas,Camille,Sandrine Kiberlain......etc...."
1,not convinving.....,"i live in france and i have a serious disease, i was thinking that buying this CD would heal me......but i'm still sick...her music and her voice does not appease me...The CD is really formated,this girl is not an artist,she has chosen her songs on a computer and she recorded the CD in only one month...for god's sake ,don't buy it...and listen to real artists just like ray charles or élodie frégé (a french singer)....and one more detail,she is not a star in france!"
1,probably the worst album of the world....,"Her voice has nothing exceptionnal,and contrary to all the rumors of people,she has not talent at all...Her second album is certainly going to be as formated as her first...she cares only for selling more and more CDs, and she doesn't have the Soul of the real artist,and also she likes fairy tales:she is a singer for very young children...The texts of her first album don't have a deep meaning...i' m so sorry to tell you that....but this album is dull...But i can also tell you that there is more talentuous artists in France...but big news for you, people,she isn't a confirmed artist in france and she has to make her place in the landscape of music in france....and guess what...She is not ready to have one..."
1,I don't belong to her fans.....,"I live in Miami,in Florida,and i've discovered Nolwenn thanks to a Catholic tv show.I've bought her CD,but i can't find words to express how i'm disappointed in this purchase.My son have some troubles of anxiety,i was hoping this could help him to feel better,but nothing happened...I can notice that the music sounds good for me,but i don't really like her voice...I don't care if she is a good girl or a bad one,and i think the quarrel between french fans is kinda ridiculous.We are here to comment on the product,but i also think that this is typically french to blame on everyone all the time.But let us return to our business,i don't appreciate the CD all in,but i want to say that i'm grateful to the others commantaries which have made me discover others names of the french music."
3,Love the print copy but ...,"The Kindle edition is too small to closely examine the paintings. I did get the new print edition, but not the kindle version."
5,Watercolor Artist magazine inspirations,"I have had this magazine many years ago. I received a new subscription for Christmas. Most of the articles inspire me in some form since I am a watercolor artist. I especially like their columns of Creativity Workshop, with instructional details on an artist's technique and Studio Staples, with information about products. This is worth the purchase."
2,Not impressed!,I don't like most of the artwork show cased in this magazine. There were only about two magazines the whole year that had good artwork in them in my opinion. I would not recomend this magazine!
4,watercolor magazine,It is always fun to see other painters techniques. We can always learn somthing new to incorporate in future paintings.
1,Slooooww Delivery,Couldn't write a review since I haven't received an issue yet. I subscribed in January 2011 and have yet to see an issue. Ship date is April 18. Why does it take so long? I'll think long and hard before subscribing again. I have two other art magazines I subscribe to and have not had this problem.SG
1,Watercolor Artist magazine,I am sorry I ordered this magazine. It is so disappointing and a complete waste of money. If I knew how to unsubscribe I would. I would not recommend it to any serious painter- utter rubbish.
2,Different Strokes,"Originally, I purchased these totally by mistake. I like the creamy flow of Prismacolor regular colored pencils for the work I do. And, that's just it. What effect do you want to create in your art? I only used these for detail, fine line work and embellishing. They are so hard that yes, they are virtually pediment (not eraseable). I find they also gouge deep into the paper so you have to use paper or canvas that holds up under pressure. I use them so rarely that my small set will last for years, that's because of the hardness too. Of all my art supplies, they are a very limited and specific use tool. For your style, they might be an inspiration.Other great ""soft"" colored pencils are regular Prismacolor (you can get open stock - one at a time, at Michaels and try them out), Derwent and Dick Blick has their own brand, very inexpensive with colors that the other Artist brands don't have."
3,Smooth,Length:: 0:15 MinsLovely colors.Great blendable quality.I never have problems with any Prisma brand pencil.Easy and fun and the tips don't break off easily.Highly recommended for your creative side.
3,Less expensive color pencils for small work,"These Prisma Verithin are suitable for detailed, small drawings and not that expensive;better color thickness than cheaper ones.The down -side is the same problem as with other Prisma pencils---hard to sharpen,the wood casing splits or breaks often and the lead breaks often both with hand-held sharpeners and the electric ones.I should mention that Prisma rendering is too waxy with all care in the final result...so the pencils are good for small sketches and drawings---not for serious artists. For serious work, go for more expensive European color pencils!"
4,Nice quality results.,"The results I have had with using the prismacolor verithin pencils has been wonderful. Two problems however I must say are that the ""convenient easel design"" is a struggle and not really convenient at all. The other issue is I have experienced breaking while sharpening and using on about 4 or 5 out of the 24. Holding the pencil with your right hand and turning the sharpener with your left hand does result in lower torque and a sharp point but doesn't seem to do a whole lot to prevent breakage."
1,dont buy these,they are too expensive and the pencils are crappy. the orange keeps breaking and i havent even used it yet. same goes for a few other colors. save your money and buy something else that will get the job done.
1,Worst Ever Coloring Pencils,This is the worst amazon item ever. The colored pencils which were bought expensively do not work. Every time you sharpen them they break. I've been sharpening them with 7 different sharpeners. I do not recommend anybody to buy this. I actually do not recommend any human being to buy this. This is the worst coloring set in history. I wasted my time and money buying this when it doesn't even get sharpened. It is very easily breakable.
1,You'd Expect More From PrismaColor,"Unerasable, almost impossible to blend or shade with because of its permanency. Worst of all is the sharpening! I wore down half the entire black pencil just trying to sharpen it for the first time. The lead breaks and pops out every stinkin' time! You'd expect better from such a high end name. Pity."
5,Great tool for artists!,This was part of a Christmas gift for a talented young artist. He raves about it and uses these pencils all the time. I purchased it thru Amazon with ease and prompt shipping. Barbara
4,Lovely for the detail work,"I make art regularly for school and personal pieces. Usually prefer pencils as my favorite media, bought this for 10$ on sale and was very content with the outcome of some of my art pieces. Does an amazing job on detail.Probably wouldn't recommend using it for regular coloring or large amounts of filling in. They are 'verithin' which means they're more firm and meant to be sharpened thin for detail work. If coloring full pages etc, definitely should buy the regular Prismacolor pencils."
2,Flimsy...,"It may be my fault because I remember this product being what we used all the way back when I was in high school art. At the time our teacher did emphasize that these were not to be sharpened in a standard sharpener because it would destroy the tip. We were instructed then to use a razor or exacto knife to make a point, and then a piece of sand paper-like stuff to make it finer.However I bought the Prismacolor pencil sharpener along with this. And when the pencils arrived after the sharpener I noticed that inside the box was a leaflet with a picture of the sharpener in it, the implication being that it would work with the pencils. Since then I have destroyed at least one pencil because the sharpener simply breaks the lead every single time no matter how gentle you try to be."
1,Where was the dog killing?,I was very disappionted by the clear ommision of dog massacering. This is one to miss with little usful information. I am no wiser on methods to dispose of my neighbours dog. I still only know one way and that is quick and painless! I need more HELP!
5,I didn't do it!,"What not a shakespeare movie,Kenneth Branagh is great actor and derictor.Robin Wright Pen is great,finally another actress he works well with!Emma Thompson is wonderful,but we like to mix it up a bit.A great movie ,so check it out!"
5,"Brilliant, Superb, What a genius. A real nice Comedy","This movie is just great at all levels: story, humour, actors. They are all just great. I can't understand why the press shut it down so hardly while it is a precious stone. This movie is so under-rated. Just watch it, you won't be disappointed."
3,A slow movie that is kind of pointless?,Kenneth Branagh is a famous Shakespearian actor who seems really out of place in a slow human drama in which he plays an aging playwrighttrying to have children with his wife. The movie is more like a kind of situation comedy where the hero gets abuse from even the theater janitor.The result isn't interesting or funny enough even with very good acting.I didn't much like this movie.
4,Kenneth Branagh,"If you like Kenneth Branagh and have a dry sense of humour, you'll like this movie. I saw it on tv and liked it so much that I bought it. I've watched it several times and got a good chuckle every time."
4,To India and back!,"I spent several weeks in 2004 traveling through India using only this guide. The hotel listings were very helpful and even a relative that accompanied me on my travels (who is a cosmopolitan native) was impressed at the hotels we found for very reasonable rates and convenient locations. I always asked to view the room before checking in because my standards vary from their standards, but this book gave me a great headstart on which hotels to visit. If I didn't agree with their recommendation, I always found a similar hotel. It is a bit thin on the history and culture, for which I suggest a Fodor's."
2,UGLY,"this ring is so ugly, and huge, but its ok for your daughter on holloween or something if she is going to be a princess or something. i wouldnt wear it in public."
4,Nice curtain!,"I admit I was a bit disappointed with the color of the curtain when it first came in the mail. It wasn't really ""beige."" It's actually more yellowish and golden. Nevertheless, I like the material and it doesn't stick to my legs in the shower like other curtains did in the past. The ""hookless"" part of the curtain was very easy to put up! I would have liked this curtain/model to come in more color options."
5,Wonderful Idea!,Never before have I seen a Hookless Shower Curtain until my husband and I stayed at a recently renovated Red Roof Inn in upper NY State. The Hookless shower curtain is absolutely a wonderful thing! No frustrating shower rings to load on a shower curtain rod... no shower rings to tear loose.. and best of all... when the Hookless curtain is used on a crescent shaped shower curtain rod... the shower curtain does not brush up against your body while you are in the shower!! WHAT A WONDERFUL IDEA - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO EVERYONE!
5,Great Shower Curtain,I really like this shower curtain. I'll never go back to rings. Just wash on occasion. Bought two so I could just change them out when it is time to launder.
1,Not a shower curtain,"I loved this shower curtain. simple. beautiful. Then I started taking showers, and stepping out into large puddles of water. Water goes right through it. What the heck use is that? I could take a shower without a curtain and not spend $40!!"
4,Very nice curtain for a decent price,"This is polyester or something similar, very nice and soft.Look like a high quality material. I am very pleased with the purchase.Will comeback for a review after a month of usage."
4,Good hookless shower curtain,"I'm sure if you had any metal shower parts (i.e. curtain, shower head rack, etc.), you had issues with rust. This shower curtain has no metal parts, and it works just fine. It does turn pink at the bottom so spray it with diluted bleach then rinse, and it only needs that.The shipping took a long time though. We did not receive it until 4-5 months after ordering it through Amazon. You may need to wait for a while."
2,The liner does not match,"This shower curtain was recommended for purchase with the a PEVA liner. They do not work together. The grommets in one do not match the grommets in the other. One has an inward pleat at the end, the other has an outwardpleat at the end."
2,Not as expected,"5 ft. Curved Shower Rod - WhiteI expected more from the amount I paid for for this shower rod. I should have sent it back, but the wife said I had already made holes in the wall and it was going to stay there. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.Hookless Litchfield 71-by-74-Inch Fabric Shower Curtain, WhiteThe shower curtain had to be sent back because it was two short."
1,Misleading Ad,"Does not state the curtain is vinyl, but also makes no mention of a liner which should accompany this product. The vinyl hookless curtain I have now is wonderful and I purchased the Litchfield as a replacement. NOT!"
2,"Content for older kids, style for youger kids","I wish I could have listened to this CD before buying it. The content of the songs is good as far as providing descriptions and explanations of various science topics. However, every song is sung with the same forced voice that sounds like a dorky dad trying to imitate a punk rocker so he doesn't have to pay for a clown for his kid's birthday party. Honestly, each track sounds so much like the others that it seems like one very long song. I played the CD for my daughter once, then donated it to my local library. If you're looking for good science music, I haven't found anything better than They Might Be Giants' ""Here Comes Science,"" which includes a DVD of educational and fun music videos to go with the CD."
5,science rockbots,great for my classroom...would be a little easier to have lyrics inside the package...still great
3,Rednecks,"Have I heard this whole Cd, no, but I have heard the redneck song and it says ""A redneck is nothing more than a working man"" So, to the previous ""reviewer"", are you against people who have to work jobs, probably manual jobs for a living??Charlie, a one hit wonder? That is just ignorant.Am I a Bush fan? No. Do I agrre with all of Charlie's politics? No.Charlie is an honest person, who says what he believes and that is something that G.W. could learn from"
1,Not exactly easy listening,"If George Bush made an album this would be it, and it certainly brought a lump to my throat although not perhaps for the sort of reason that Mr Daniels might have intended, good tunes well played but I couldn't manage a second listen. America is a wonderful place Charlie, much like the rest of the World that is also out there. 3 stars for the album docked 2 for the Jingoism."
1,jingoistic pablum,"Mr. Daniels is clearly profiteering from the War on Iraq, just like those idiots who were selling t-shirts with pictures of the twin towers exploding a day after 9/11. Shame on you, Mr. Daniels."
1,The World Needs MORE Rednecks???????????????,It's rednecks like Bush and Hussein who have brought us to the brink of world war.The world needs more of that????Charlie--you were a one-hit wonder at best. Go back to the woods and be content to count your money.
4,Freedom and Justice For All,"Fantastic!!!Anyone that is a CDB fan will be delighted with this!!Thank you, Thank you, Thank you..............."
5,"JANE,LA GOULUE ET VALENTIN","Il y a le can can bien sur,JANE AVRIL,LA GOULUE(dont on verra la déchéance)et VALENTIN LE DÉSOSSÉ.Mais il y a surtout un transfert dvd remarquable;la couleur est nette et absolument irréprochable.JOSÉ FERRER excelle a nous montrer la dualité de TOULOUSE-LAUTREC,a la fois gai dans ses oeuvres et malheureux en amour.Des fondus enchainés permettent d'admirer certaines oeuvres du peintre.Pas de bonus,ni de galeries de photos,mais on ne saurait s'en plaindre ici.A la fin,sur son lit de mort,HENRI dans un mirage,renoue avec les personnages du MOULIN-ROUGE,tandis que son père découvre trop tard le talent de son fils.Deux regrets:ne pas avoir fait figurer ARISTIDE BRUANT et YVETTE GUILBERT(un choix du scénariste)pourtant rendus célèbres par le peintre, et ne pas avoir inclus la piste sonore FRANCAISE.Qu'a cela ne tienne,qu'attendez-vous pour acheter ce film?"
1,NO LETTERBOX!,"The idiots have struck again! Ruined a beautiful film by cutting it up to fit a tv screen..are they all insane?!!! If I hadn't opened it, I would return it to amazon now! A flim that was shot in a wide screen format should be shown on the small screen that way. The directors vision has been ruined again by money grubbing fools! Don't buy it."
2,NICE STORY SHAME ABOUT THE COLOR,The only Moulin Rouge film I've seen is from the TV and I would imagine the video is another U S only one. But 1952 is no excuse for such poor quality color and this is what it was like in the cinemas. Maybe the video has enhanced it.Rodgers & Hammerstein would never have allowed anything of theirs to come out in such a state as they supervised the filming of things like Oklahoma and Carousel.You want criticism you got criticism.The real Moulin Rouge has yet to be made as the new film leaves a lot to be desired
2,GHOSTS APPEAR AND FADE AWAY,"One of the best movies of its time is little more now than a ""period piece"". Indeed, the movie's terrific theme song has stood the test of time much better than the movie. Paris in 1890 is not exactly a ""big draw"" to today's movie goers.Ferrer, on the other hand, does a masterful job in playing Toulouse-Lautrec, brilliantly portraying the handicapped artist whose sketchings and posters hang today in the Louvre. But, the overall production seems prolonged and repetitious, and the fast paced banter of the actors seems difficult to follow.Since its release in 1952, many other films including ""Rainman"" and ""Forrest Gump"" seem also to have pushed director Huston's ""masterpiece"" aside. Now, however, if Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio would care to try an updated version..."
1,Pan and Scan - DVD is NOT letterbox!,"The film deserves 5 stars but the DVD only gets 1. Why: no letterbox format. After waiting years for this fabulous film to come out on DVD, why would they give us full screen / pan & scan? Yes, the quality and color are great but oh, what we're missing on the sidelines."
2,Who is Zsa Zsa Gabor?,"On a souligné la performance de José Ferrer, mais son ton sentencieux m'agace un peu...La faute aux dialogues, quelquefois académiques. Etant franais, je retiendrai surtout l'apparition de Suzanne Flon, car la prestation de la matresse de Lautrec, dans la première partie du film, est tout simplement exaspérante.Mais au fait, who is Zsa Zsa Gabor???"
2,Not Enough Life,"Moulin Rouge traces the life of artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and his paintings of the famous French nightclub. Jose Ferrer gives a strong, emotionally controlled performance as the crippled artist who is unable to accept love in his life. A large part of the film centres on his relationship with a streetwalker tiringly overplayed by Colette Marchand. Not a great deal of time is actually spent in the Moulin Rouge, which is unfortunate since it may have injected some needed life into the story. The film left me cold. Toulouse-Lautrec had a very difficult personality (at least as portrayed in this film), making him a hard character to relate to, and there wasn't enough spectacle or life in the story to at least hold on to. I wish I could add to the raves about this film, but for me it was a very unsatisfying viewing experience."
4,A DVD version requested!,"This film is a wonderful minor classic: great atmosphere, solid production values, and certainly well-acted. The film is among the many that cause me to wonder why it is not yet available in the DVD format."
5,HOW COME...,How come no one else has reviewed this cd. It's a great cd. The only problem is that it's only 10 songs. Don't let the cover fool you. And don't let the recordings on Amazon fool you either. It's cool. For metal fans only. No Limp Bizkit and KoRn fans.
2,Save Your Money,"There are much better biographies out there on Elvis. This was a real disappointment to me. I had the pleasure of reading some other biographies on him, and this really can't compare."
2,Too Bulky & Slippery,"The reviews of this item seemed great, so I ordered a pair. Unfortunately, they are too bulky for my tennis shoes and they cause my heels to slip up and down in my shoes."
3,Short term relief,"I have Achilles tendinitis and I spend a lot of time walking on uneven surfaces. I'm 5'9.5"" and weigh 200lbs. I used these in my work boot. They weren't very comfortable from the start but they did prevent me from painfully overstretching my Achilles tendon. However, when I was on my feet for an extended period of time, more than 3 hours, the inserts became extremely uncomfortable and eventually painful."
2,Disappointed,"Moved around in shoe, did not fit in some shoes, pulled socks down, some relief for short periods of time, when wore in house shoes. Was hoping for more!"
3,pain relief but do not stay put,"These cups definitely bring relief but they do not seem to stay put in my shoes. After walking a while, they have moved up my heel and out of my shoes."
2,not for me,"just did not work for me, heel pain was the same or worse. but seems like good product well made"
2,Sizing is confusing...,"Bought these, thought that they would fit, I weigh 120 lbs. WAY to big! What a waste, can't tell if they do work because they don't fit right... Well made though!, have a feeling they might work if I didn't waste the money on a pair that didn't fit!"
4,Best Heel Cup for Relief from PF (for me),I think I have tried every heel cup made at this point...and these have proven to be the best for minimizing PF pain.I removed the insole of theOrthaheel Arcadia - New Style - Casual Mary Jane with Orthoticsand replaced with the Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotic Insoles-M 4-4.5 / W 6-6.5.The shoe actually (by luck) fit even better with the Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotic and the Tuli heel cup inserted than with the orignal insole because the shoe had stretched out. Orthoheel shoes have great (and removable) insoles but the Powerstep orthotic proved better for me.The two together--the orthotic and the heel cup--are a must for me. One or the other at one time does not suffice. But the combination gets me through day better than any other insert(s) have so far.So if you haven't tried them yet--the same combination may work fairly well for you as well.
3,Tuli's heavey duty heel cups regular,I assumed this would get rid of the heel pain. It helped to ease the pain but they weren't as affective as I thought they would be. I did get some relief. They are better than nothing They were better than heel cups I purchased from a chain store
4,big girl likes them,i wear one cup in my left hiking shoe and workout shoe and my heel pain has been reduced. i recommend this product.
2,Heel Cup,"I bought these to help with my heel pain. They seem ok at first, but they tend to twist inside my shoe even though they are the correct size."
2,More cheaper quality cups,Cups are not worth the money they are soft and don't do the job advertisedvery unhappy with them and had to reorder Tuli's hard plastic cups later inanother order don't waste your money.Cups are to flimsy.
5,Greet heel cups,"These are study, well fitted to my heel, fit in my shoe and seem very durable. They provide a good cushion."
3,Didn't work too well for my heal spur,My diagnosis was a heal 'spur' and I really didn't notice any improvement from these heal cups. These would work better for plantar fasciitis. I'll keep them just in case I do develop a fascia problem. Well made and inexpensive.
4,Does the job,This was a good buy. Good for heel problems and plantars fasciitis. But this soft gel cup is better for a dressy shoe and for short periods of time. For longer hours and work boots buy the green ones. Their stronger and more durable. These fold a little to easy when putting your shoe on.
2,Does not live up to hype,"Ironically (or coincidentally) my older brother and I discovered we were suffering from the same kind of foot/heel problem at the same time. His doctor had recommended the Tuli heel inserts, and my brother claimed they helped him. So I ordered the same. I found just the opposite: my heel did worse after inserting them in my most comfortable shoes; and my heel felt better after I removed the insert after several days. So, sorry to say, I feel majorly disappointed in the product."
5,An excellent product,This product is excellent. It brings comfort to the heel and is easy to use in different pairs of shoes.
5,Pain Gone!,"I suffer from plantar fasciitis, which flares up without warning and is quite painful. I bought these when nothing else was working and within minutes of putting them in my shoes, the pain was gone."
3,go w/ the originals,"I had the original Tuli's back in the day and found them much more comfortable than these. These are much bulkier and really take up some space in your shoes. The backs fold over and cause pinch points and dramatically raise your heel. I would recommend these if you KNOW you need more support and are about to buy new shoes, that way you can try them on with the new shoes you are thinking of buying instead of adding them to your current shoes. The only reason I didn't return them is it would cost more to return them then what I paid for them. I would however recommend the original Tuli's if you are planning on adding them to your current shoes, that's what I am going to do."
1,Difficult to keep in place; of no help,"It was difficult keeping the heel cups in place when wearing my shoes, and it did not help my plantar fasciitis condition at all."
1,There is no option for No Stars....,"Not impressed. They will not stay in place in my shoes - they turn sideways in my shoes and are pretty much useless as they are very uncomfortable when this happens.When they are in the proper position they are comfortable and provide a decent amount of padding, but after wearing them for five minutes, they've shifted position. I looked for instructions to see if there was something I missed, but there didn't appear to be any in the box. It's pretty self-explanatory how they go in your shoes, but there's no way to keep them in place. They do seem to help with the plantar fascitis, though.Off to look for something from Dr. Scholls that will stay in place....."
1,BEWARE! Not worth buying or trying. Better off with Dr. Scholl's.,"I purchased this product because of heel pain. The bottom portion is similiar to egg crate but the sides are very thin and flimsy. When you place your foot in your shoe the sides bend and fold over. Plus it feels weird with the heel of your foot high and the rest of your foot flat wihich makes it awkward to walk in shoes. My advice, is to consult a professional when dealing with your feet before you make the problem worse. If possible I would have given it 0 stars!"
2,Heel cups,"I have had heel cups in the past that were better, they are too flimsy, curl up when putting on my shoes"
4,Better Than Dr. Scholl's,These are great heel pads for the spurs. Nothing the OTC Dr. Scholls has compares. It's not gone yet...but trying combined with everything else I am doing.
4,Works well,"I was not really sure what I was getting when I purchased so I ordered two. As it turns out, they in fact come with two cups per order. Makes sense now, but did not seem obvious at the time. In any case, they have really helped with my sore achilles. They appear to be quite sturdy. I have used them for about a month. One pair in daily shoes and the other pair is used in various workout shoes."
3,Not for 200+,I suffer with foot pain and will try anything to help me walk without PAIN! this item is not for a 235# man just not enough I am still searching for something to help
2,heel pain,"these heel cups did nothing to help my pain, as a matter of fact, to balance them I had to put one in the other shoe and that foot started to hurt then also. Not the right product for me...."
2,Didn't help,This is made well but really didn't do much to help my plantar fascitis. Fits well in the shoe but I can't tell any difference in the heal that doesn't have the cup inserted.
4,Tuli's Heel Cups,"Very comfortable & durable! the only knock I have on them is they shift locations while wearing them, but I guess the comfort overrides this fact."
2,Do Not Order Heavy Duty if you have small feet,"I regularly recommend TULI Heel cups to my patients. However, I purchased a pair for myself and was very disappointed with the fit. I got the Heavy Duty because of the (Over 175 lbs) tag. I am 180 and 5' 9"". I wear a 10 1/2 shoe. I should have got the regulars because these are too loose and sloppy on my feet. I think this is the problem with many who gave these a 1 rating. Still love TULI product. However, buyer beware. You must have the right size!"
3,"Work well, may cause blister(s)","I bought these heel cups because I was suffering calf pains from the high impact/shock from running, and they very worked well for that problem. Within the first day of newly using these on my runs, I began developing a small blister (through my sock - on my right foot) from one. I trimmed it (which is very easy to do!), and that didn't seem to help very much. I might try wrapping gauze around the heel cup and my foot so that it has no place to move around (and cause a blister). I wear a 9/10 shoe, and am on the lower end of ""above 175 lbs"", and these fit perfectly in my shoe and with my weight. I have small ankles, and the opening to my running shoes reflect that, but they still fit in my shoe, with a little adjusting."
4,Very helpful for plantar fasciitis,"Tuli's Heavy Duty Heel Cups, Large (Over 175lbs)My doctor recommended these when I had plantar fasciitis years ago. I've continued to use them as well as to stretch before any extended walking, and my plantar fasciitis has never returned."
4,Does the job,"I bought these heel cups when I kicked up my walking distance from 18 miles to about 32 miles a week. I started to notice some heel pain (Plantar fascitis) and knew I had to do something quickly. I purchased a set of Tuli's heavy duty heel cups and a set of hard plastic heel cups. These hard heel cups work by molding the heel is such a way to put fat or cushion in the heel. The tuli cups work by providing the cushion in the cup itself. Both sets of cups worked great. No problem with fit (Size 11 1/2) with either. The hard cups are a little easier to work with. The tuli cups require you to pay more attention when you put your shoes on since it is easy to fold over a side of the cup into the shoe. If you pay attention you'll be fine with them, too."
2,These didn't help me much at all,"I'm an avid walker, and I have Plantar Fasciitis and a Heel Spur, probably my own fault because of wearing cheap flats over the past few years, and not stretching my calf muscles before my daily 3 mile walk. These heel cups helped some, but not enough to get excited about them. I don't know why they couldn't be made in clear instead of green so they wouldn't show at the top edge of my shoes.These also don't seem to stay in place in my shoes. Several times a day I have to take my shoes off and re-position the cup as they tend to slide down towards my toes."
2,Didn't help at all,"After reading the reviews, I had high hopes for these helping my p.f. heel pain. Unfortunately, they were too large, moved around a lot, and shifted my arch so that my foot actually hurt more with than without them. I am debating whether to pitch them or try again but probably will do the former."
2,Difficult to Use,"I didn't like that every time I put my foot in my shoe, the back of these would roll down and have to be yanked and twisted back up around the back of my heel. They provided some relief but really nothing close to that of the HTP Heel Seats: Heel Cup Inserts that I bought next. MUCH better, quick relief and they are easy on, too!"
4,excellent book,as promised; fast delivery : A++; concise not verbosewhat you need to know at as a quick referencevery well written
1,No idea,It is clear that these authors have no real experience with surgery or surgical patients beyond the simple office visit. They cannot begin to imagine the complexity of managing difficult surgical issues.
4,Much Better,"Recently I thought the last few Bishop projects were under par for this group, but this project is back up to the Bishop's high standard of Southern Gospel excellence. A wonderful CD to add to any collection."
3,Decent quality,"I have washed these a few times and they haven't fall apart yet. They don't absorb water very well, but I got them at a deal and I love the the colors, so that doesn't bother me that much."
5,great book,"The book is very well written, specially for people who do not use Matlab on a daily basis. It is concise, to the point and has some great examples.I revisit the book every couple of month to brush some of the concepts."
5,I'm so happy to own this DVD.,"You can't ask for a better combo. Billy Sheehan, Tony Macalpine,& Steve Vai. Despite all the negative critics,I'm so glad I didn't give a SH*T and had to judge for myself. I feel grateful to own this since there are so many crapy bootlegs out there at twice the price. For those Guitarist who are starving for captured vertuacity on DVD also checkout Strunz & Farah. I'm talking about flawless unpluged Guitar work at the speed of light."
5,AMAZING,"Wow.. I sat down expecting to watch an awesome DVD, I mean, afterall, it's Vai. What I got when I was watching this, I cannot even put completely into words. Everything on this DVD was perfect, and I dunno what that other guy was talking about, the camera situation was fine, plenty of Vai hand shots.All the players on this DVD are all VERY talented in what they do. I was surprised by Tony MacAlpine and Dave Weiner, as I'd never heard of them before; they are just awesome.For the usual Vai antics, this is definitely the DVD of choice, I saw some things on here I'd never seen done before, totally jaw dropping..GET THIS NOW!!"
1,UHH...What is this Garbage?!,"When i first heard steve vai several years ago i thought he was 'intersting' based almost exclusively on his technique and chops. well over the years he still has not learned how to write a song. everything he has ever written stinks and drips with cheese or is some kind-of sugar-coated 'ballad'.as far as this dvd is concerned it is an atrocity really: REALLY BAD VIDEO EFECTSTERRIBLE GUITAR TONE AND EFFECTSCRAPPY SONG WRITINGBAD SEQUENCING-but how do you tastefully sequence a whole slew of mediocre or just plain terrible songs??and add to that STEVE VAI IS A BIG FREAKIN' POSEUR, WHAT IS WITH THE FAN BLOWING IN HIS HAIR FOR THE WHOLE SHOW??!! WOW! ISN'T HE COOL!?i found the whole thing nauseating. i can't think of any redeeming qualities except that Steve's singing on one song is not too bad.IF YOU LIKE VAPID GUITAR WANKERY AND SONGS THAT MEAN NOTHING AT ALL THIS IS FOR YOU."
1,horrible,this guy couldnt write a song to save his life so he just plays solos as fast as he can and makes squealing noises with distortion and harmonics. how boring.
1,Would have been better in the 70's,"Guitar heros in the music world are no longer important. When Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen played, automatically generations wanted to play. But no players have come across since with such apogee and influenced as many. Steve Vai actually makes the guitar a boring instrument to listen to. There isn't anything exciting in his play. The songs are dull and their composition is outdated. Vai is till churning out the old Frank Zappa type of play, and to be 'frank' it's dead. His only audience must be the over 40s."
3,Mmmhhh... too many effects for my taste...,"I would like to state that Steve Vai in my opinion is one of the greatest guitar players I've seen, also it is a shame how bad he skills when it comes to creating music. For the love of God (included on this DVD), Tender surrender (not included) and I would love to (not included) are the only songs I actually like to hear.Anyway this DVD is not such a good purchase not because Steve's performance but because of the annoying effects. The camera is moving all the time switching between the drums, bass, keyboard and Steve. It was more like watching my young kid playing with a video camera instead of a professional recording.I give it 3 stars because I really like seeing Steve playing guitars but for the rest it is not worth it."
5,Musicianship to the max,"Long-time fans already know what Steve is capable of, and this DVD should serve as a shining example to new listeners (and new guitarists, of course) of the kind of expression possible with an electric guitar when it is in the hands of a master. Aside from obviously high quality, non-formulaic songwriting and dazzling technical skills, the thing that has always impressed me the most about Steve is that every note he plays, even in very rapid passages, is articulated like a word in a sentence. That is, there are no notes that are merely ""played,"" but rather are ""spoken"" in terms of phrasing, rhythm, dynamics, attack, tone, etc. As a guitarist of 20+ years, I can tell you that it is exhausting to play even a slow passage of Steve Vai music because of this. Each note must be worked individually. Of course the DVD also shows us again what a great entertainer and showman Vai can be. Highly recommended."
1,Waste of talent,"No doubt, Vai is blessed with ability. Mind blowing speed and tricks out the wazoo. But that doesn't equal music. These songs SUCK. He's a forty something playing and acting like a teenager..I felt embarressed for him and the boys most of the time...Go buy some Robert Fripp dvd's or Stevie Ray...they're better for your teeth..."
1,One watch was enough.,"Steve Vai's performance as a guitarist is okay. But the set-up in this concert is crap. The camera moves all over the place like the holder is having a fit. Dave Weiner as an new guitarist is nothing special. Not a Paul Gilbert, Jason Becker or Ritchie Kotzen, if you know whata mean. Tony Macalpine has opted to forget his solo career and now work as a background monkey for Vai and play the keyboards whilst Vai does the show as the grinder. Billy Sheen looks like he;s aged 30 years since the DLR days and sucks. The extra disc to this concert is crap. Overall this pile of trash is absolute and utter crap. Avoid!"
4,VAI is AMAZN!!!!,"I used to rate vai OK types. I am a die hard fan of JOE, ERIC Johnson, Petrucci etc...This DVD is just amazing, VAI Got boost in his performace with Billy Shean, besides now he is playing some melodious tunes...Whispering a prayer is just awesome!!!I will recommend GUITAR GUYS AS A MUST BUY!! for rest of folks recommended buy!!! VAI's MUSIC is ENCHANTING!!!!"
3,"Lights, Camera, Too Much Action...","Greg Bradelle's review was pretty much on the money. As a fan of Steve Vai, I was looking forward to an entire DVD devoted to his performance. Unfortunately, nobody told the camera crew that it was not THEIR show. I'm sure the poor slobs who filmed the Cream's Farewell Concert didn't realize they were butchering historical concert footage either, but time has proven them wrong. The performance by Steve and crew was plenty exciting without the addition of all this photographic chicanery.The experience of TRYING to watch the concert was an exercise in futility and frustration.At one point in the concert, Steve playfully takes a camera away from one of the ""photographers.""Too bad, he gave it back."
4,"If you love guitar, you will dig this","Steve shows why he is one of the most popular guitarists in the world today. With a world class band, you will be both inspired and awestruck. I agree with a couple of other reviewers who were distracted be the horrible editing, bad transitions and wipes. If you can get past that, then you should enjoy 90 percent of this DVD. Steve and his band are amazing. Great players with great stage presence, but of course, Steve goes a little too far with some of his onstage antics, some personality is great, but gyrating with your guitar between your legs is too much!The second DVD has some amusing stuff. All in all, both discs are easily worth the money for anyone who loves rockin' guitar music."
1,THE WORST DVD FROM THE BEST GUITARIST,"This DVD was so long in the making that I really expected it to rule the world. I've seen half a dozen Vai concerts and every one of them was amazing, he's truly one of the most gifted guitarists alive, EVER.Pity then, that his live DVD SUCKS. The music is great but you won't know because you're too distracted by the choppy editing, amateurish production effects, and frenetic... ARGH! I really can't believe he released this like it is. I wanted to be able to really watch the show and take it all in but I just DON'T ENJOY WATCHING THIS DVD. It hurts. I want to turn it off.Buy a Frank Zappa DVD instead."
2,"ENOUGH of the (not so) ""SPECIAL"" video effects!!!","Like ""I. MUNOZ"" said ""contaminated"" with video effects.Some 15 year old must have just gotten his first video editing equipment, and felt the need to use every single effect, almost all the freekin' time.Sound and selection of material is fine, but I buy DVDs because they include VIDEO, so if the video sux, the DVD sux. This sux."
3,"great music, torture to watch..","well torture would be too extreme, but I find that when I've put the video in on occasion, I can't watch it long without the video effects killing me. My advice, don't bother with the dvd and just buy the cd. The sound quality also sounds better on the cd.cheers!"
3,a little disappointing,"Steve rules, of course, but I'm surprised that while some here complain about the visuals no one mentioned that quite often the audio and video are out of synch. For example, you'll see Virgil Donati hit the snare drum and an instant later you'll hear it. This is especially noticeable/annoying during the drum solo.If you listen to the commentary track, you'll realize that Steve himself added all those cheesy visual effects, so I'll cut the guy some slack for trying (although I'm not so sure the long-awaited live DVD is the time to experiment). He also says that he had to intersperse two different nights' worth of footage along with the audio for a lack of good shots. So all in all it comes off as sort of ""patched together."" Still worth having though, especially for the lack of anything else Vai."
2,Great guitar work but...,The sound is great on this DVD. I have however seen better camera work in home movies and amateur internet porn. This video crew should never be allowed to touch cameras again. I give it a second star only because the music and performances are great. I also understand that Vai did some editing himself. My only advice to him would be that just because there are special effects on a software package does not mean you must use them all on one film.
3,"Ok, but could be better.","As others have already noted, the camera work is poor and full of cheesy effects. The extramusical elements of the the performance were ridiculous. Vai goes WAY over the top with his theatrics and makes some stupid speeches throughout the concert. I often wish he would focus more on the music and less on the theatrical aspect. Yes, it is entertaining, but only to a point. Vai always seems to go past that point. However, the playing is excellent throughout and is worth buying if you are a Vai fan. Particularly impressive is the performance of 'Whispering a Prayer'. Great piece."
2,Wasnt what I thought,"Thought it would be the brushed metal. Instead, its just silver paint at the end of the day and very disappointed with it. Would not recommend."
2,Not that impressed,"I bought this can opener just about a year ago and out of the blue, it just stopped working. There is power through the cord but the opener just doesn't work. Cuisinart products usually last longer and are better quality than this item. I would not purchase another one of these."
5,"Other reveiws are ""user error""!! Great Can Opener!!!","I bought this from ""an external site"" and after I'd bought it, I'd read the reveiws and thought..""oh no""!! HOWEVER, after receiving it and using it, it is a great can opener!!! I have had it over 2 months and not ONE issue with it. The problem most people here have is they probably haven't alligned the cutting blade appropriately to the can and then ""beat it up"" cause it doesn't work if the blade isnt positioned the right way. Once you know how to do it, it's a breeze and NO ISSUE at all! This is definately worth the money!!! I reccomend!!!I've been using this can opener for over 6 months and it still works great!"
1,"Horrible, the worst ever","For the price and the Cuisinart name, this is the worst ever, takes many tries to get it to work, pet food cans particularly impossible. I threw it out. Never again."
2,Should have read the reviews,"I recently bought theCuisinart CHW-12 Coffee Plus 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Hot Water System, which I really love and think looks great. So when I saw this ""Cuisinart Brushed Chrome Can Opener"" on sale, I made an impulse buy thinking that it would be useful and look good in my kitchen with my brushed chrome coffee maker.Imagine my disappointment, then, when I took it out of the box and found that the ""brushed chrome"" was not the same as my coffeemaker, and was actually just cheap, painted plastic.As a can opener, it works OK. It can be clunky and hard to get the can in place, and the blade doesn't always cut clean. It really isn't much of a step-up from my generic hand-operated can opener.It's my own fault for making an impulse buy like that. I really should have read the reviews. Chock it up to lesson learned, and the knowledge that the name ""Cuisinart"" on the package doesn't guarantee a good product."
1,misnomer,Can opener is truly a misnomer. This things does not open cans. I can't even give it one star
1,junk,"I purchased a NEW Cuisinart Can Opener from an Amazon.com seller a few weeks ago. I think I've used it 6 - 7 times to open soup cans. The can opener is junk. It would take 5 minutes or more to open the can if I was lucky. It first tore the paper off the soup can, then it took me many times to try and line it up so the blade was actually hitting the top of the can. Worst can opener I have ever bought. I'm very dissapointed in Cuisinart. And most of it is made of plastic painted to look like brush chrome. I just bought a Hamilton Beach can opener. It's a much better product with lots of metal parts, easy to use, opens the cans quickly and quiet. The blade lines up instantly to the top of the can."
1,Don't buy it,"Ours broke apart after about 2 years. It's made of cheap plastic and just painted chrome, it's hard to get many average cans to align properly (this was an annoying problem the whole time), and I would not buy it again nor recommend it. Not worth the price and not well built. Try another brand."
1,unable to open a can,"The can opener does not work on cans we have tried to open. I am considering returning it. The cutting blade would not penetrate a small can of mushrooms. Then when we did the blade to penetrate a larger can of beef broth, we had to hold the top lever down firmly, and help the can rotate on the opener, Not what I would consider a top of the line product."
1,Wanted a good can opener got a bad one,"Not a high priced can opener, but not a cheap one either. I usually am a middle of the road kinda guy usually finding adequate quality in the mid range price bracket.I used to have respect for the name ""Cuisinart"" so I forked out the few extra bucks to upgrade from the last can opener that was worthless and didn't work. I was hoping that with the name backing it I would be satisfied, and I am not hard to get along with. Well shortly after purchasing it, it became more and more difficult to get the can to align correctly to open the can. It did not always hold the can properly, sometimes dropping it and making a mess. Then it began to make a grinding sound that got worse and worse till I just couldn't stand it any more, so in the trash with you. Can't anybody make a decent can opener at a reasonable price?"
2,What a Disappointment...,"1. It is PLASTIC, Cuisinart never advertised this as plastic, it has a great chrome color but plastic...boo...looks cheap2. The Can Opener SPLATTERS way too much, what a mess.3. Great Height and ColorImprovements are definitely needed.I'm so disappointed in Cuisinart, they used to provide quality products. This is not a quality product."
1,What a total POS !,"This is the worst POS for a can opener that I have EVER seen! It lasted almost ONE WEEK before it fell apart. It's CRIMINAL in my opinion to ever sell something this shoddy in design, workmanship and inferior construction.The first week the opener sort of opened cans OK but not great. By the second week the cutter head was wearing out and would not even hold the can, let alone open it.ABSOLUTE JUNK IMNHO.I can't believe Cuisinart would even place their name on this Chinese CRAP!"
1,worst opener I have every owned,Very very hard to get the blade to mesh with the top of the can. So frustrating I am throwing it out. I would not even give this to someone.
3,"Nice clock/radio, but not as advertised.","As stated in other reviews, this is NOT an atomic clock. I knew that when I bought it (I wasn't looking for an atomic clock). It states it comes with the time preset. As the other reviewer mentioned, the preset time was incorrect when I received it. I had to reprogram it. The clock will reset itself for SHORT power outages, but failed to reset during a recent 4 hour outage.However, I am happy with this clock/radio overall. I like the alarm features, and the radio sounds pretty good. The clock numbers are large and can be dimmed. It has a lot going for it. I just wish it would perform as advertised."
2,Great clock that doesn't last long,"I loved this clock for two whole years. It was the only clock in the house with the proper time after a black-out, and the dual alarms with weekday/weekend settings were great. But just last night, after having it for two years, it stopped working. After messing around with switches and such, I found that putting the ""dimmer"" to the high setting was the only way it worked, and the numbers were barely visible. The bottom was _burning_ up, like a Sony laptop battery. I thought it was going to start a fire, so I just unplugged it. I was late to work this morning, and have to go buy a new alarm on the way home . . ."
1,Nice features but poor quality,"I really liked this clock at first; it sets itself automatically when you plug it in, it recovers after power outages, and it has nice flexible alarm settings. (By the way Theresa, weekend alarms can be turned on by holding the Alarm 1/2 button and pressing Alarm Mode).However, after just 3 months the clock began acting erraticly; the display segments periodically fail and some buttons no longer work. Needless to say this impairs the usability. It is disappointing that a clock marketed as being so ""high-tech"" would fail so quickly, and I will not buy from Emerson Research again."
2,Radio Stinks - Good Clock,"The AM radio is awful. Even strong stations are barely audible. All you hear is a buzz which gets louder when the display brightness is increased. The FM radio is OK, not great, but at least you can hear a few stations. The clock is fine. Nice bright display."
1,Permanent DST Nightmare!,"These were great radios until the recent DST change. Since these are NOT Atomic and are pre programmed on a memory chip they can no longer change to the new time. Now three weeks later, after changing the time manually, we were waken up 1 hour early when it reset to the old DST and made the time 1 hour later. This, or the opposite, will always happen twice a year! It becomes a manual clock that will always default to the wrong time, during the new DST timetable, or when unplugged or after a power outage! If you need to get to work on time bring this clock back or throw it out! so far they are offering no support for these problems. Unacceptable."
1,unreliable,"I bought this clock 3 years ago. Loved it for about a year when the first alarm quit working. Just Last night, the second alarm now no longer works either. Has been a big disappointment."
3,I HATE having to shop for new alarm clocks,"I purchased this alarm a couple months ago. I'm pretty happy with it as far as the alarm and radio go, but, my BIGGEST pet peeve is how BRIGHT the numbers are at night! Even with the dimmer switch, which for me doesn't dim it enough. Do they even test these things in the DARK? If I wanted something that bright at night I would leave the LIGHT on for Pete's sake!"
1,It was great........,"It was great until like all have said the Day Light Savings change and now I see they are ""out of stock"" on Amazon. Hmmm? I've heard so many different things to change this, but it comes down to me changing my clock an hour ahead or behind the night of DLS. I bought 3 for the family to use, now I have to change it every time for my mother, thanks Emerson!"
3,hummmmmmmmmm,"The alarm clock looks great out of the box. It is easy to follow the directions and do the settings. The numbers are nice and bright and big enough to see easily, but there is that little constant hummmm of electricity that I just couldn't stand. In the middle of the night I had to unplug it. If you are bothererd by the hummmmmm of electricity I wouldn't recommend."
5,"So far, decent alarm clock radio, nice features","My mom was actually the first to purchase this radio. She got it because she didn't have to set it, a big task with her. And, living outside of town, power goes out a few times a year with storms, even better to have a smartset radio. So when My birthday came along, she bought me one. Unfortunately, the factory battery was dead in my radio, but I replaced it and the clock keeps time, and resets itself when tested. great alarm features, 2 alarms able to set them for different days of the week if preferred. Note, these are not atomic clocks, if the battery dies completely without being replaced, the clock will reset to 1200. These were set at the factory, and the little lithium battery (2430) keeps them active. I like the clock, works well, and the radio is decent as well. Check it out."
1,Emerson Research Clock,I was so excited when I first got this clock. It was amazing! I've now had my clock 3 months or so & the digital numbers are barely readable. I am so upset! I've replaced the battery & that didn't help. I guess I'll be buying a new clock soon and it won't be an Emerson Research!
1,"It fails at its most basic task, waking you up!","I'll admit, I was won over by this alarm clock by all its bells and whistles. But its alarm feature is the worst.I'm a hard person to wake up. I hit the snooze constantly. The snooze on this alarm clock only goes off once, so if you don't wake up you won't be woken up again! Also the Buzzer is VERY soft and has no volume setting for it. If you put the alarm across the room from your bed you'll probably not hear it let alone wake up from it!This is the worst alarm clock I've ever had! I had to by another one three days later because it did not wake me up and I was over an hour late for work!"
1,Avoid this if you live in a DST area of the country,"If you happen to live in a DST area, I would avoid this product if you expect it to automatically adjust when most of the country switches to daylight savings.The product manual states that all ""Daylight Savings and Leap Year adjustments are made automatically by the SmartSet internal computer."" The Start of Daylight Savings Time is to be 1:59:49 AM on the first Sunday in April. The End of Daylight Savings Time is to be 2:59:59 AM on the last Sunday in October.Those dates no longer apply to the new daylight savings standard, so I would recommend looking elsewhere if you desire a clock that can work with the new daylight savings dates."
2,A Shame It Can No Longer Set Itself,"I bought this clock about two years ago and then they go and change the day the time changes occurs so now my clock changes the time on me a week early so now I have to set the clock manually in addition to remember when the time changes used to occur so I don't get messed up on time...I mean what the heck is the point then? I know they didn't foresee such a change but the changes forces me to buy a new clock if I want to have a working self setting clock? Ridiculous!Other than that glaring flaw, however, the clock is good. I enjoy the dual alarms so in case I sleep through or in a ""sleep induced haze"" turn off one I can have a back up make sure I'm awake...hopefully."
1,Don't buy.,"I have had nothing but trobule with is clock. I dont loss power very often but this clock does. Or it losses time. I looked forever for the battery No body caries it. I had to go to a batttery speciltiy store. Replaced the battery and that was no help, still turning off."
2,Good concept but bad quality,"I bought this item because it features ""smart-set"", which means that the clock radio automatic sets the time and date when plug in power. However after about a week, the radio decides to turn itself on. Even when I turned it off, it will turn itself on after some random intervals (30 sec - 5 minutes). So I will have to return this to Target."
3,Never Wave at a Wave - Refreshing & Undemanding,"This comparatively little known film, with the extremely unlikely storyline is, nevertheless a joy to watch. It is pure escapism with more than a hint of nostalgia for those of us of a certain age. The script is good with some nice one-liners, but because the plot itself is obviously rather weak things become a little laboured. I doubt it would come over as successfully as it does, where it not for the one and only Rosalind Russell - ever able to combine excellent dramatic and comedic acting with the epitome of Hollywood glamour. And where oh where would it have been without that stalwart, always believable, and I think much underrated actor, Paul Douglas as Russell's long suffering ex husband.If you feel like some light hearted 1950s entertainment you could do a lot worse."
5,Never Wave At A Wac,"The movie was made in my home town of Petersburg, Virginia and Fort Lee Virginia when I was a boy. My mother got to meet Ms. Russell in person. She found Ms. Russell very charming."
1,cables,"I ordered 4 of these before Christmas. What came was 4 3' HDMI for which I have absolutely no use for. I contacted the seller and got no response. For the cheap price, it wasn't worth pursuing. I would NOT buy from this company again."
2,"Too technical, too proselytizing","Daly presents a realistic view of sustainability and discusses economic policies that need to be adopted or abandoned in order to achieve this goal. In that regard, the book is a tour de force. However, his arguments are couched in the language of economists, and are difficult for even a well educated (non economist) reader to follow. Furthermore, in the last two chapters particularly, he finds it necessary to proselytize, and becomes insulting towards people that do not share his religious beliefs."
1,Doesn't always work,"Be advised that some dogs LOVE this stuff and will happily lick it up. My puppy will lick this even while it's still wet--in fact, I think in his case it works as an attractant, not a deterrent. I had no luck with different brands either, such as Bitter Yuck. We were discussing this topic in obedience class and I'd say it did not work for 60-75% of the puppies whose owners tried it. And the people who said it did work complained that they had to re-apply it every day. I think it is still worth trying, but don't get your hopes up that it is some sort of miracle spray."
2,Mr.,"The product may work fine for other dogs, but unfortunately I have a female Lab that will eat or lick most anything. She made a face and shied away from the product at first, but was soon lapping it up."
5,handy refill size,Our new dog came with a chewing problem. We aren't home enough to catch him in the act so the bitter apple works great. The small bottles are a little expensive but the big refill is great.
2,"Good idea, but Agiri doesn't deliver.","Agiri's story, which begins in West Virginia and migrates to New Haven--with occasional excursions to other places--starts from a good idea (the ultimate in Victorian restrictions: male-male relationships), but then doesn't go further. Agiri seems to have traded quality for quantity, and while her story is enjoyable and relaxing in a boring Sunday-afternoon kind of way, we never see her characters developed: they each have their own ""history,"" but their development in the story (if any) is plainly linear. The story seems to move slowly and with no clear direction, but ironically it still remains highly predictable. This is not a novel which Forster, as one of the reviews on the book's jacket claims, would have written. Agiri's attempt was noble, and her details of a Victorian New England are well-based, but she fails to grab all the elements she's amassed and deliver a good product."
4,Romantic and fanciful,"*The God in Flight* is not bad as in itself-- but anyone looking for historical quality displayed in *At Swim, Two Boys,* won't find it here. Its style is somewhat between historical fiction and a flighty romance novel... it tends to be VERY unrealistic most of the time, and the ""fate/destiny"" factor of Klinarios' ideal-waif just cheapens the entire storyline. Simion himself is a weepy, ambivalent character with a loose set of morals... his character didn't quite appeal to me-- although Andrew, the local playboy, is an easily lovable character. :) Overall, though, it's an entertaining read, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. The overall effect is very hyperbole-- roses and candlelight, lace and satin, jealous lovers, passionate sex (with flowery descriptions) and the power of destiny. >_< If it were a story about love between a man and a woman, it wouldn't be any more original than half the bodice-rippers out there."
2,the reader in flight,"This really is an awful book - the worst sort of airless female fantasy about homosexual men. It's quite elegantly written, but deeply pornographic, not in the number and fervour of its sexual descriptions, but in its lack of anything else: this is all the author wants to write about. The scene is the sheerest fantasy: a version of 19th-century Yale in which no student has any interest whatever in the opposite sex.The author's role model seems to have been Mary Renault, whose wonderful book The Charioteer receives an oblique kind of tribute in the final pages. Read The Charioteer instead, or again."
3,Nice product for the price!,"I just purchased this VCR/DVD combo at the local Wal-Mart (sorry Amazon, I had gift cards to spend, otherwise I would have purchased it here). =)It was extremely easy to set up, and it played the first DVD flawlessly. I noticed in another review that someone complained about the DVD tray. I did not find it anymore flimsy than other DVD players in the same price range.My only wish is that it did have an eject button on the remote. It does seem odd that Philips didn't include that feature.Overall, I am pleased and highly recommend buying this product. If you're looking for a ton of bells and whistles and something not encased in plastic, then this isn't the product for you. But it is a decent product to watch the occasional movie, whether it be on DVD or VHS."
3,Outdated,No eject button from the remote and the VHS rewind is slow as molasses. Otherwise OK but you can get something more up to date for the same price.
1,Piece of Crap,"I bought this for my elderly mother - not a whiz at electronics but she knows how to insert a disc and hit play. However, it seems the machine doesn't know how to scan a disc and play. We would get various screen messages, ""insert a disc,"" ""faulty disc,"" ""loading,"" but the thing wouldn't kick in. We'd eject and clean the disc. We'd eject and and re-load the disc. We'd turn it off and on again; ""insert a disc,"" ""faulty disc,"" ""loading."" Sometimes, after who knows which combination, Oh! it would play! Pretty darn frustrating for an elderly lady and her daughter so I swapped it out for my Samsung 4600. Now she is happily watching Christmas with Andre Rieu and I am listening to jet aircraft approching as I try to watch a VHS cassett. (it's pretty loud)"
1,Never worked once,"Purchased at WalMart. The VHS worked, but the DVD never worked properly once. It would skip, stop, restart the program constantly. We never saw a single DVD all the way through. Contacted WalMart and Phillips both, with no satisfaction from either. Phillips was hard to contact, and when I finally got through to someone, their only solution was to sell me a reconditioned one. I had a service technician look at it, and he could find nothing, but we fought it for four years, mostly trying to just ignore it. My main objection was Phillips' position was basically, ""Your player, your problem."" I finally took it into the backyard, got my sledge hammer out of the shop, and adjusted it myself. Problem solved."
2,Does not play DVD's from other regions,"Great DVD/VCR combo but does not play DVD's from other region. Does not have an eject button on the remote either. If u have DVD's, VCD from other countries that you would be playing I do not recommed this player."
3,Great voice,"Marti has a terrific voice for this kind of music (well, OK; she has a terrific voice, period). I was less impressed with the songs themselves. There are some really good tracks--the covers of ""Heartaches By The Number"" and ""Seven Lonely Days"" are very good--but a lot of them sound a bit like they were written just to fill in the number requirement (""Uh, oh--we need a song about Eight. Quick, somebody write a song about Eight!""), and the lyrics were pretty weak. Musically, though, this is great."
3,"Dry goods, but informative","An educational but at times fatiguing read on the pivotal role of the nineteenth century military post trader.Delo effected some demanding research on this subject and the reader gains insight as to the significance this profession played in frontier expansion.The trader's demeanor and importance was both praised by many and debunked by many. The subject matter of whether or not to allow alcohol on a military base bounced around like a tennis ball for the entire century. The question always seemed to be to either abolish alcohol entirely or limit its consumption.That aside, the function of the post trader seemed to be several fold. Besides furnishing provisions such as dry goods and foodstuffs, he was also the news source, post master, banker and creditor. The entire geographical area centered around the post trader.An interesting read on a subject oftentimes overlooked."
5,Great family movie,If I had to pick a movie to show my grandkids that has meaning I would pick this movieThe Joyriders
2,Read the information about this SACD carefully,"This is a review of the SACD of the highlights of The Phantom of the Opera. I didn't read the Amazon product information carefully, thinking I was buying an SACD version of the original Michael Crawford & Sarah Brightman soundtrack. It isn't and what a disappointment it is. I compared it to the CD highlights version with Michael & Sarah, playing them side by side using two players and swapping between the two, the SACD player and the CD player. The SACD sound is clearer for sure, but it just didn't have the impact factor I expected from an SACD. The organ opening sequence is a bit anaemic, and my overall impression of the SACD recording is it has no power or depth. The CD is better in these areas. If you are willing to pay for a clearer recording with a bit more detail, okay. But if you're looking for that Michael Crawford rich voice, and for a powerful, stirring SACD version of the production that makes you want to hear it again, save your money."
5,Addicted to the music...,I had downloaded the movie on my Kindle and loved it. so I purchased it. It's hit that I hear in my head and sing over and over.One of my Best purchases.
3,"Just the Movie Soundtrack, nothing special",I was rather dissapointed in this Hybrid SACD. After listening to other SACD's that were remastered to provide the fullest 5.1 experience this was fairly lacking.I expected to be fully immersed in the Orchestra and it just appeared to be the 5.1 movie audio transferred to SACD.
2,Movie quality SACD,"I bought the SACD thinking I would see an improvement over Blu-Ray sound quality from PS3. However, I am a bit disappointed because the quality only improved a little bit when played on a proper SACD player.I now have the convenience of playing and selecting any song quickly but not the satisfaction I was hoping for from a true high fidelity music recording."
1,Disappointed,This is a hybrid SACD multichannel and stereo disc. I already have this music in a DVD containing the amazing film with the same name. This DVD has the same music in Dolby digital (pro logic IIx). If you do have equipment to decode this signal you will have a wonderful experience compared to this SACD. I will say I'm deeply disappointed considering that the multichannel mix already exists making the movie.
4,Wyler's Chicken Bouillon Cubes,Wyler's Chicken Bouillon Cubes are second only to Chicken Granules which are handier. They are a bear to get as the folks around here don't seem to know how good Wyler's Bouillon is. If I can get my hands on some I go to great lengths to get it.
3,Intelligent but dry,"I like Cozzens; he writes with wit, insight, and intelligence. Think Dreiser but not as long-winded. This book is probably best enjoyed by lawyers, especially trial lawyers; the plot centers around their interactions and the court proceedings of a murder trial. Although well written with an enviable command of English, I found the book too dry to be truly entertaining."
4,"Good, readable introduction","This is a good book. Whether you are interested as a teacher or student trying to learn more about the Hindu Goddesses, or just curious, this book provides a concise and effective introduction to some of the major Goddesses of Hinduism, as well as background information on classic Hindu scriptures and Gods. The style is academic, but it is also readable. Numerous black and white photos throughout help illustrate the Goddesses of Hinduism. I highly recommend this book."
3,Eh... it was okay.,"It's really a look at the Goddesses from a scholar's point of view without any religious attitudes whatsoever toward the subject matter. He treats the goddesses kind of like they're archaic symbols of some distant past, rather than great women of a living religious tradition. Good for students who are taking a course in this type of study, but not really good as a look at the goddesses through a devotional perspective."
2,Just not my cup of tea,I believe this book is strictly for scholars and Hindus. It is somewhat dry and unless you have an overwhelming interest in the subject can become quite dull. It does have excellent detail and structure for those interested in the subject but alas I have discovered I am not.
2,Not Insightful,"This book is really basic coverage of a lot of examples of success without much analysis into becoming successful. I read a fair bit on the subject and I am not prone to write negative reviews, but this book really is not insightful. If you're looking to just read quick examples of success then this book is an easy read. If you really want to become successful look to ""7 habits of highly successful people,"" ""think and grow rich,"" or on the more philosophical side the ""Power of Now."" Hope this is helpful."
4,Nice Collection of Vignettes,"A nice collection of vignettes on success, planning, attitude and approach by over two dozen business and civic leaders. Reading the book provides inspiration, motivation and practical techniques for achieving balanced success in life and business. Some of the vignettes are poignient while others are somewhat blase. However, taken as a whole, the book provides a nice collection of thought provoking reads, and can be sat down and read through like a book, or used for some daily inspiration one story at a time."
4,Networking in Bite Size Pieces,"I love this book's format - short, digestible pieces. We all carry so many pre-conceived notions about networking, Dr. Misner and Mike & Mike did a great job of busting those myths. My favorite is ""Treat people like they want to be treated"". Nope, it's a Delusion!"
2,"Bob's song, great. Otherwise a waste.","I think that's it! Should you pop for this on the strength of one really good remix with Robert Smith adding fills? You'll like it, but it's not essential. Your call."
1,Zero Stars,"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! I thoroughly enjoyed reading the three Aeron books, and I was thrilled to find this one. . . until I read it. I did finish reading it, although it was a struggle. I found that the amount of violence and vengeance was almost palpable as I was reading. I found it disturbing to say the least. It was definitely not of the calibre of Patricia Kennealy's Keltiad series, and it tainted my view of her earlier works. I used to enjoy re-reading those books, and I hope that one day I can again, but not until my memory of Blackmantle fades."
3,Wish Fulfillment,"Anyone who has read Kennealy-Morrison's ""Strange Days"" will recognize the unveiled fictionalization of that story in ""Blackmantle"". With this book the series makes the final leap to the predictably redundant. The ""ferocity"" of certain female characters, stalwart and over-compensative chivalry by the males, hyperbolic indulgence of the description and emotional hysteria one has come to look for in recent Keltia are here, as are the godliness and/or direct divine descendence of the ever-present and popular girl-hero makes the reader wonder where the new book is. The anger thing is just tired. Hard to take seriously, hard to finish.Where is the luminescent delivery of ""Hawk's Grey Feather""? Of ""Silver Branch""? The series began promising, even enthralling, with a society warm with a culture of magic and stories deliciously delivered, eloquent and unique; fans may wonder if ""Blackmantle"" doesn't just go too far, as it feels like the author has made Keltia a new forum for anot"
1,"An outerspace, Keltic autobiography.","I was able to get to page 200 before giving up. The characters are underdeveloped and shallow. There is a ""waiting"" for action which is predictable when it finally comes. A catharsis for the author? I miss the Keltia I have come to enjoy, richly developed, emotionally meaningful. Ms. Keneally does a disservice to her ""bard"" Morric Douglas by keeping his character remote and distant. I grew tired of the anger, which almost seemed undeserved based on the shallowness of the character she was avenging."
2,"Hard to read, not like her earlier work...","I feel for Kennealy-Morrison, I really do. But I must agree with other reviewers here that this book is far below the quality of her earlier work. I loved the original Copper Crown series, they were vivid and engaging. This book is so obviously and painfully autobiographical that it's quite hard to read.I sympathize with what she's been through. And I know writers are supposed to ""write what you know"". But this was too much for most of us, we don't want to share this stuff. Let Jim go Patricia, and get on with your life. We'd like to read more excellent fiction the like of which we know you're capable of, but this, sadly, just isn't it."
2,Not the stories I remembered,"I absolutely adored the Aeron books, struggled a little to finish the Arthur books, but this one; well, lets just say I hope the next one's better.I lost track of the characters, because they were never fleshed out. I was a bit disturbed by the punishments metered out (especially in light of the fact that she has stated the characters are based on people she knows), mainly because the reasons behind the punishments were not clearly speeled out (I mean, killing someone for writing unflattering comments? )I hope the next books are more in line with the original idea: although Ms Kennealy-Morrison obviously misses her beau, this really should lay it to rest as far as rebuilding him in the Keltiad series."
1,boring...............,"I was bored with this book. Could not read the whole thing because I felt like I was reading ""strange Days"" all over agian. Her whole focus is Jim Morrison. Boring book."
1,Horrible Plunge into Author's vanity,"Though her previous efforts have been entertaining; this latest is a horribly written attempt to rewrite history. Unfortunately the history being rewritten is not Celtic but the life and times of Jim Morrison.Maybe this was an attempt at catharsis. Though glimmers of revenge were rather clear. Overall I found the book tedious. Little action or even resolution made it to the page. And in all I found her tone incredibly smug and spiteful.On top of that she has apparently dropped the excellent cover artist who did the previous covers for someone whose work definitely borrows from the Heaving Bosoms genre.Not that I judge a book by its cover; I was just trying to find something in its favor. And even that was not possible.Return to the fantasy world you have created so wonderfully in the past Ms Kennealy. Otherwise please warn those of us who have run out of patience with you. A big ""Jim and Patty do the Celts"" sticker on the cover will do just fine."
1,"A synopsis of a novel, not the novel itself.","Lack of dialogue, more 'telling' than 'showing', rushed pacing, and overuse of authorial intrusions make this book a disappointment to loyal readers of Patricia Kennealy-Morrison. 'Blackmantle' might have been an epic series stretched out along two or three books, but even having to wait for those books would have been preferable to reading what amounts to a several hundred page synopsis of the novel(s) the author should have written. If you want vintage Kennealy-Morrison, stick with 'The Copper Crown', 'The Throne of Scone', or 'The Silver Branch'."
1,Disappointing after Arthur & Aeron,"My 1st experience with Ms. Kennealy's writing was the ""Aeron"" trilogy, starting with The Copper Crown - truly excellent in my opinion, as was The ""Arthur"" trilogy. Suffice to say that Blackmantle was a severe disappointment. Athyn's development was disjointed, the obsession with revenge & torture unappealing and plot meandering. Morric appeared as a paper thin entity not a consort; the other characters also lacked depth enough to be anything but pale scenery. I found myself scanning, not reading, hoping vainly that the plot would improve. This book doesn't have much in common with its predecessors or the Keltia previously described /created. Skip this book and read Copper Crown or The Hawk's Gray Feather as an introduction to Keltia. Hopefully Ms. Kennealy will regain her previous focus in future ""Keltia"" installments and put aside the disappointing diatribe shown in Blackmantle."
2,Far from a triumph.,Blackmantle is in my opinion a hugely disappointing effort from Kennealy-Morrison and is symptomatic of a slide that has occurred in the quality of the series since the Copper Crown ( a truly superb book ). I agree with the comments about it being a thinly disguised autobiographical novel and it got far too mystical in places -not enough essential action. I await the arrival of the Deer's Cry on this side of the Atlantic with a touch of foreboding- especially given some of the comments I've read on it
2,get hooked on the others of the keltiad not this,"I have read all of the Keltiad produced to dae and found this one very disappointing. If you are new to Patricia's work start in one of her other books. Black Mantal gives some more background to characters we meet in Aeryn and Arthur's trilogies; however, the characterization in this book is incredibly weak. Start with The Copper Crown or another one of the books of the Keltiad and return to this book later so you aren't so terribly disappointed."
4,"Excellent, but lacking some","I recently read ""Blackmantle"" for a book report after borrowing it from a friend. I found it both exciting and romantic and loved nearly every page. However, I was somewhat upset with the ending, feeling that it could have had more. For those who are dissing this novel in comparison to other Kennealy-Morrison books, I cannot argue with you because this was the first novel of hers I have read. However, it does make me want to read more of her books; and isn't that the point of writing?"
5,Blackmantle Deserves Better!,"While it is true that Patricia Kennealy Morrison's Blackmantle is not in the same league as the Aeron or Arthur series, it's not ""supposed"" to be. I found PKM's ""Celts in outer space"" story to be a charming love story, never mind that you can read her own history into it and yes, play anagrams with many of the names. I find the previous reader comments peckish and with an underlying tone of personal grudge. Hmmm, wonder why they sound alike... Well, anyway, I found that, as usual, PKM's command of Celtic culture and language made reading Blackmantle that much more enjoyable. She's truly in a class of her own."
2,Paging Mr. Dickens.,"Well, I only read this book to keep up with the rest of the Keltiad, so some of the background detail was Ok.I will point out one howler, Athyn's much loved stepfather was one of the hated Incomers. At least she waited until he died before she tried to slaughter the rest.And as for her love life, I'm reminded of Mr. Dick in _David Copperfield_ He couldn't keep King Charles' head out of his writings, Kennealy-Morrisson is obsessing about Jim Morrisson. Give it up. He's DEAD. Personnally if it was that great a romance, he would have made it a legal(civil) marriage a LOT sooner.He was as big a twit as any of the rest of us can be even when we're not strung out on our drug of choice."
3,Initiation,"I bought Initiation because I grew up with Rodney Harvey in South Philly. I only found out recently that he had made movies. It's sad that his life was cut short so tragically. I have to say that the potentional for Rodney to grow artistically was there, but the direction in this movie suggests small budget at best. I definitely would not consider this movie a classic by any means, however I can see where Hollywood saw Rodney having potential to be it's next big star. Here's to you Rodney, may you rest in peace."
4,An Insiders Glimpse into Mr. Televison's Life,"'My Father, Uncle Miltie' presents the story of growing up as legendary comedian Milton Berle's son. MFUM tells the behind the scene details of Milton's somewhat private life, a life full of gambling, women and mild hatred toward his son. MFUM provides anecdotes never before made public, and makes one think of how much Berle's private and public life were vastly different. I recommend this book to any fan of Berle who wants to catch a deep glimpse of his character behind the curtain, and off the television screen. One might me a bit amazed...as I was."
4,"Informative, Entertaining and Surprising","I've thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent with this easy to read work. The book is rich in the interesting history of one of the world's most beloved entertainers, penned by someone that could only be a loving son. Both funny and tragic, it held my attention through the honesty without scandal. An unexpected ending certainly reminds us we're all equals! Thanks, Bill!"
2,Baby Dolly Partons,"I bought this album because it was in the bluegrass section of my local music store. It is not bluegrass... it's country pop. VERY country pop. And the cover photo shows one of the girls holding a mandolin. She doesn't play the mandolin on the album at all, some other guy does, according to the credits. She's just vocals. The album wasn't what I was expecting at all. I was hoping for a couple of girls playing their instruments and singing some bluegrass, but instead I got an overproduced and souless album. But if you want to listen to a couple of mini-dolly partons, you might enjoy it."
3,"Dull text, great photos","The Walker Evans photograpy is indeed remarkable, but Agee's thick prose is deathly dull, and at times it seems he is only down there to ogle the women."
3,Let Us Now Praise...,I have no means of knowing about the book. I sent it as a Xmas present with numerous other things and the recipient hasn't had time to read it. It was one to add to his library of photographer/photography.
1,Wretched,"I have no idea how this book got such a reputation as a classic. Agee writes that he is afraid that he will not be able to appropriately capture everything that he is witnessing, and that was a valid concern on his part; the text is overwrought and verbose to the point of being unreadable. Four hundred and some pages of unreadable, really.On the other hand, the photographs by Walker Evans are spectacular. I would rather have seen the whole story of these tenant families in Evan's stunning black and white than wade through James Agee's tedious prose."
1,Also agree that this is a BAD book.,This book makes you fight for every concept. It does not explain the reasons well and then gives you Excel problems with no conclusion. Do not take a course that uses this book to actually teach you or you will be in trouble!
5,Good condition no problems,The book came to me fine and within a week after i purchased it. The pages were fine and the cd was still intact.
1,Shipped the wrong item,"I am very picky when come to order stuff online. The item Americarx has sent me was totally different from what I've seen the image from the site. The mirror can't be adjust and can't really pack it for travel either, it will break, the handle was build very curvy and you can't bend it. Never order anything from them again."
1,"Wished I had thought to read reviews, before buying!","I bought 2 of these in the 30 or 40 pack and i was tryng to burn some cd's this weekend at home off my computer. I will now be reading reviews before i commit to another brand, but it won't be MEMOREX (i bought based on name)!! Anyone have a better Brand?!"
1,do not buy!,"As another reviewer said the black ones are a blackhole. But not just the black, they are just the worst. The black ones completely fail to record past one song, while other colors fail about 50 percent of the time. I just bought these at target, now I see the reviews and I don't understand WHY ARE THEY STILL SELLING THIS CRAP????"
1,Extremely Disappointed,"It appears these music CD-Rs do not work on most home CD players. I can only get them to work in my computer and in my car CD player (and that doesn't play back as great a quality as I'd like). I thought these would work since I had previously bought JVC Audio CD-Rs which are awesome. I won't bother with these again and unfortunately, I bought two spindles!"
3,use the coorect type of cdr,there are 2 types of cdrscdr data disc- will only record on a computer driveif you want to record on a home audio cd recorder you MUSTuse recordable audio cds--they have a symbol on them that states:compactdiscdigital audiorecordablefor consumer
1,Never again,"Four months ago, I used this product and had no problems except the finished CDs did not play in one person's car player. With this stack every one of the first 15 CDs I made did not play in most equipment, although they played in the recorder where I copied them. It was very disconcerting to put them in other players and get nothing, or get something only after forwarding to the 3rd track. Didn't understand why this was happening. But I'll not buy them again. It was a waste of many hours since I was assuming they worked."
1,Will not work as Digital Audio CD-R.,"Avoid a headache. I had the same problems with these new Memorex music CD-Rs. They will not work in my Philips CD audio deck, and as you can see in other reviews they don't work on most decks. I suspect they are plain digital CD-r's, or that the newer 40x discs will not work on Digital Audio decks. A design flaw at any rate. I have had great luck with older Memorex Music CD-Rs, but I believe they were 32x. I have no problem with Sony Music CD-rs which are easily available, and cheaper most places. However, Memorex is good with warranty service in my complaints about these.Great for dummies who pay extra for music CD-Rs for their computer because they are copying their friends CDs!"
5,Works without a hitch!,"I needed CDs that would work on my new Sony CD Recorder ... the Recorder will only record onto ""music"" CDs in the cda format. I didn't take this warning seriously at the outset (I didn't realize there was a difference between regular CDs and ""music"" CDs), and of course the machine wouldn't work. After a small amount of research, I bought this well-priced spindle ... and the recording has proceeded without any further hiccups."
1,JUNK,"These recordable CDs are terrible!! I had just made three CD's on another brand on my Phillips cd recorder; all fine.Then these terrible blank discs would not properly record. They got to the 8th cut or the 18th and then the disc would screw up and not accept further; one wouldn't finalize as it filled it's last cut up with ""no audio"" though I had recorded only 30 miniutes of songs. So they wasted my recording time and money. NEVER BUYING THESE AGAIN."
5,Excellent,"Good quality, Excellent product, nice improvement, easy to use and easy to read. Very good I'll recommend it to anyone"
1,Doesn't work with Marantz,I have a Marantz CD recorder DR 6000. A previous generation of Memorex Music CD-R worked fine (White with purple lettering and blue recording surface) This new generation will not be read by this recorder. The recorder could not initialize and gave an disc error with several I tried. It Worked fine with some new SONY CDRs.
1,Will not record,"I finished up my last batch of these discs bought some time ago, without a problem. BUT the next batch purchased most recently will not record on my Philips CDR 765. There are too many different types of media discs and not labeled properly. Should be an industry standard that the consumer can readily see that they can use them. Not sure what to get now or if another brand will work properly."
2,Recording error,"The CD's are for being used for live recording, finalizing the disc usually produces a 'Recording Error' although they do work.Also the surface is a little too slippery, making writing on it with a sharpie not as good as others."
4,Great,Shoe is very comfortable felt a little narrow than expected but will work fine once broken in. Shoe is cute
1,What a Disappointment!,"I already had a pair of Softwalk's Jupiter in size 9S in black and loved them. So much so that I ordered a second pair. But when they arrived, the new pair was at least one size wider and at least a half size longer. I could see just by eyeballing them that the shoes were much too wide. And when I held the right shoe up to the right shoe of my old pair of Jupiters, the difference was even more apparent. In addition, the leather in my old pair was shiny outside and soft and lovely on the inside. The new pair was dull, dull, dull; and I could not tell whether the inside was leather or some sort of leather-look-a-like product. The degradation in materials and quality control between the earlier pair purchased and this one was amazing. So back went the shoes and off went a letter to the shoe manufacturer."
3,Not Quite Navy,"These are more of a dark teal, not true navy. Fit is fine. These were about $8 cheaper than Zappos. I have several pairs of this shoe and they are great."
4,Great introduction to Thanksgiving!,My son loves Corduroy and has to get a hat to wear when we read this book because Corduroy has one. I describe each page to him and he just loves it. He enjoys naming all the fruit and animals.A good and simple read!
2,Complete but basic review of WW1 fighters,"This book lists all fighter aircraft from the First World War. The listings are alphabetical by manufacturer. Each aircraft is afforded two pages: one has some phtos and an abbreviated history; the other is the standard three-view 1/72 scale drawings that Harleyford/Harborough uses. At the back is another standard H/H format; namely a series of eccentric and esoteric photos grouped by categories such as engines, captured aircraft in opponents colrs, gun positions, etc. This is a plane-spotter's and modeler's guide and nothing more. If that is what you need, the this book is of value to you."
1,Totally Worthless,"I tried multiple times to download this item into Itunes on my computer; no soap, Doc. I then tried twice to play it on a regular stereo. Also, no dice. It flat-out doesn't work. I then went back online to see if I could return it and either get a replacement or my money back. I found nothing that showed me how to do either. I would NOT recommend this vendor to ANYONE."
5,The best of the 3rd set of stories of 'The First Americans',"William Sarabande's ""First Americans"" series is actually several sets of books related to different generations and different characters. I consider this the 3rd set of characters and this book contains the best story about those characters. The first three books of the series are by far and away the best. The second set is good once you realize that the original characters aren't coming back. This third set really allows the reader to see how myth and history may combine together to create rites and rituals that ""people"" follow. It is more interesting in these later books how the ""truth"" of the history gets twisted just enough to make the stories quite different from what really happened. I recommend starting at the first book, ""Beyond the Sea of Ice"" and reading this series in order, just to get the best benefits and insight out of the stories and the writing style of Sarabande."
3,Smells awful but feels nice,"I put this cover in the bright sun for a week to help the smell; it's tolerable now but I'll keep looking for one that smells less toxic. It is comfortable to drive with though. My auto parts store carries it also, and they don't carry anything better."
2,Smells to high heaven,I would give this One Star but Amazon made it right. I've had this sitting out for 5 days now and the stink is not subsiding so I decided to return it to Amazon. When I tried to do a return on it amazon said just keep it and we'll still refund your money. I guess they don't want to smell it either. I got the exact same one for a dollar more at O'reillys and it doesn't smell. Guess I will hand it outside for awhile...... the Arizona heat can suck the stink out of anything!! Thanks Amazon. And by the way... I did try it out and it fits and feels very nice but I don't know how it loks in the car because my eyes were watering from the smell.
5,Nice Surprise!,"Great fit and feel. Better quality than expected, especially for the price. Grip conforms - memory foam. Reasonable shipping time too. Light color so not sure it's going to stay looking new without some regular care. At this price, if it gets too soiled and won't clean will simply buy another one. Really a good deal though."
1,This is what passes for genius these days??,"I admit, I had never heard Fantmas' music prior to listening to Suspended Animation. But, being a fan of Mike Patton's from his days with Faith No More, and upon reading the great reviews the album has been getting, I was curious to see what the fuss was about. I must say I'm very disappointed. Granted, there are some interesting moments and Dave Lombardo does an incredible job, but the whole thing leaves me a little perplexed to say the least.Some of it reminded me of the ""interludes"" on Frank Zappa's Sheik Yerbouti album while the rest, to me, sounded like a bunch of kids learning their instruments while jamming and trying to come up with good ideas for songs. Other parts sounded like listening to a CD while your finger is on the fast forward button. The interesting moments are just that, moments. My interest was drawn for a few seconds and then the moment had passed and I was back listening to noise.Frankly, I'm very glad I didn't pay for the album."
4,Awesome mind blowing!,"I wouldn't expect anything less from Mike Patton and Co. A piece of art crafted from cartoon insanity. Their sound is like a kid making a ""Mystery Pie"" in the kitchen a mixture of cookie dough, paprika, OJ, Milk and Cap n' Crunch mixed in a pie tin and burned in the oven. Ingredients that don't mix. Some gag on the concotion others see the brillance of developing artist. I see the latter. I was left speechless after a listen to it. I love the damn thing! Not everybody's cup of tea and thats too bad."
4,"An ironic look at a people's characteristics - To be taken with a grain of salt, but otherwise pretty much unmissable!","There are many truths here (I should know, I'm Italian :-), some baffling generalisations (coming from somebody who's written well after the 19th century, that is), but overall the book is nice, informative, fun, full of irony and stylish. I laughed out loud quite often, and I was saddened by some spot-on characterisation of our defects just as many times."
4,It's good,Met my needs. Was as advertised. On time delivery. Value for my money.What more could a person want?
3,puppy drumsticks,"Puppy likes this a lot, but what's with the list price of $59.39 and savings of 56.00 when everywhere else this exact product sells for under $4.00? AND then shipping is 8.99? Ridiculous!"
3,not as many designs as i expected,"The peek inside shows you a few designs for straight beading (like for bracelet or ribbon). When i received it, I discovered that it had many designs that were pictures (like the eagle on the front.)It is also somewhat harder to read the charts when they are in only black and white. But that you can see in the look inside sneak preview."
2,Not what I wanted,This is not what I expected or what I wanted. It is all black and white and very difficult to work the patterns from.
3,big book of indian designs,"Big Book of Indian Beadwork Designs (Dover Needlework Series)I have worked a few of the designs and liked them. I found two mistakes on the fourth design on page 5. I guess it wasn't tested before publication. I found this annoying, and will not buy any more books by this author."
4,May not be a perfect fit for your car,"I purchased this for a '95 Lexus SC400, there is a small amount of modification needed to the rim under the timing belt cover to get it to fit properly.Is it worth paying ~$40 instead of the $200 Lexus part, (time will tell but..) sure, otherwise it's a fine replacement part but be aware you may be doing some work on it."
1,background,"Truth is that I did not read this book, since I did not want to waste my time. You get similar information all over internet these days. Whenever you ""study"" a so called ""research book"", you should look at the author, affiliations and intentions. Looking at the author's other published works, I could see where this is all originating from. I will wait for a more neutral ""expert"" on this subject."
1,Don't be a fool,"The author and most of the readers are missing the boat.""Jesus Christ"" was never a real person. He is a mythological character, invented in the 2nd Century by members of secret societies and mystery schools that stretched from Egypt to China, practicing a mythological-religious tradition that had existed for thousands of years. This is what accounts for the widespread myth of Jesus in the ancient world, plus remarkable similarities between the life and teachings of Jesus, Buddha, and many other Pagan gods.If you want the TRUTH, read ""The Christ Conspiracy"" and ""Suns of God"", by Acharya S. Ignore any book that takes a life history of ""Jesus Christ"" as reality. He did not live in India. He did not live in the Middle East. He lives only in MYTHOLOGY!"
1,TINY rake!,If my small children ever decide to rake the yard will be the ONLY time this will come in handy. It's only 2 feet long fully extended!!!! UGH! With no scale given to size I was really unhappy when it opened the package. This is a total waste of money for me. *IF* I had known it was little I wouldn't have bought it. Now I'm off to the store to buy a rake I can ACTUALLY use. I would love to send it back and get a refund.
5,Great Around Bushes,The OXO Good Grips Adjustable Gardening Hand Rake is perfect for raking in and around closely packed bushes. The tool is strong and comfortable. The mechanism which changes the width of the tines (3 through 12 inches)and the length of the handle is sturdy and easy to use.
5,NIce adjustable hand rake.,I purchased this to get in among my flowers when I am down on my knees anyway. This rake being adjustable is an asset.
2,Rake si short and fragile,I received this product quickly but was dissappointed in the quality as it seems quite fragile and is difficult to adjust. Needs re-engineering as it will probably break when I adjust or use it vigorously
5,Great CD even when it's not Christmas !!!!,"I love this one !!! Sassy , spiritual and so Cyndi !! BUY IT !!!!!!!!! Fun and also very heartfeltl !! Great selection of songs and the rendentions are amazing !!!"
1,brat's last stand,instead of new tracks brat wanna remix her mid 90's single plus add a few more alternative mixes with it come on jd's that busy anyway i hope this is brat's last cd her time is up.
5,the whole motion -- james dicky,"i have been a fan of james dickey's work since college. now that i am teaching a college class in world poetry, i just couldn't resist choosing dickey. the problem was, which book to teach. i decided to use the whole motion because it spans dickey's career, including every important poem of this great, underated american poet. poetry lovers will recognize some of his more anthologized works (the lifeguard, the firebombing, cherrylog road) and will be thrilled to find other penetrating works of art regarding nature, war, guilt, love, family, and so on. i personally recommend the poem drinking from a helmet, one of the greatest american poems i've ever read. if you love dickey's novel deliverance (one of the greatest american novels ever written) as much as i do, then you will certainly love this body of poety, a must for people who are interested in poetry about the power of nature, as well as the intracacies of human nature."
5,"A Reading of ""The Sheep Child""","Length:: 8:25 MinsI feel I must state here, as with all my reviews of Dickey's work or of books about Dickey or his work, or, as in this case, a reading from his work: I knew Dickey during the last years of his life and considered him a friend.This is covered in the video, briefly, in my introduction to this poem as well as my reasons for choosing it."
4,A good translation with some flaws HCSB,"The HCSB is a good translation overall that seems to combine the readability of the NIV with some of the accuracy of the NASB. There are some places where it can be a bit colloquial in its langauge, or trendy. Matthew 5:22 uses the word ""moron,"" which is a very poor translation for the word, which actually means calling someone wholly worthless or a fool, while a ""moron"" is someone who is considered to have the genetic mental capacity of about 8th grade. There are also strong points, such as capitalizing names for God, and using bold print for OT quotes in the NT. The binding and quality of the Bible itself is very good, with soft leather. The pages are a bit thin and the print a bit light though. Overall, it is a good translation with some changes that could improve it."
4,A favorite Bible,"Aaaah! This edition makes Bible reading even more of a pleasure. Just the right size and the type is still readable. It's definitely a luxury Bible--nice leather, gold-finished pages, two marker ribbons, and more. In terms of translations, the Holman is somewhere between the NIV and the NKJ/NASB. I miss some of the beautiful language of the NKJ. Certain verses just aren't the same. For example, Psalm 23: ""He restores my soul,"" in the NKJ becomes, ""He renews my life."" in the Holman. Sigh."
5,Well... Like it or not,"Another highly entertaining and informative book by the Credenda Agenda gang. Thought provoking to say the least, but those with thin skin better look elsewhere."
2,Desperately seeking (the real) Sue Medley,"For reasons unclear to me (and another reviewer here), those looking for singer-songwriter Sue Medley are directed to this Madonna release. If you are still looking for Sue, however, read on for an overview of her hard-to-find but worthwhile work.Dawson's Creek used a number of Sue Medley's songs on their show, including ""You Won't See Me Cry,"" taken from her ""Velvet Morning"" album. Although it isn't on her ""Greatest Hits"" cd, you will find there highlights from her two earlier CDs, as well as some previously unreleased numbers.And if you follow Bob Dylan at all, you heard Sue on his 30th Anniversary Concert, where her vocals soar on John Mellancamp's cover of ""Like a Rolling Stone."" A soulful singer with a social conscience -- very much worth seeking out!"
1,Mislabeled??,"I heard a song played during an episode of Dawson's Creek, so I looked it up and found the title to be ""You Won't See Me Cry"" by Sue Medley. The DC music website also had a picure of the album cover(Velvet Morning). After I had no luck downloading the song, I decided to look it up on CDNow.com. All I found under Sue Medley was a greatest hits album that didn't have the song I was looking for. However my eye caught the album cover I had seen on the DC website. It was labeled as Borderline by Madonna but it had the album cover and track listing for Velvet Morning by Sue Medley. I'm so confused."
1,Serious fun,This CD was wrong. I ordered this CD for a song sang by Tom Lehrer. It was very disappointing to get a CD of a Female singing the Tom Leher song. I kindof feel ripped off.
3,Poorly Written,"The author didn't do a good job writing this book. She gives herbal formulas but doesn't tell amounts! Are all the formulas with the ingredients at the same proportions? Sometimes it is not clear if the remedy should be taken as tea, tinctures, applied externally. You have to be careful when working with herbs.. The book comes in three main sections: By herb benefits, By herbal formulas where it only tells the ingredients but not amounts and preparation, and By Health problems. Some of the recommendations work as e.g. the garlic oil for ear infections, but others don't. NEVER TRY THE RAW POTATO SUPPOSITORY FOR HEMORRHOIDS ON PAGE 118!!"
4,Good... but I've head better...,"I've definately listened to better compilations, but this one is pretty awesome. There are, like, 3 or 4 songs on here I cannot tolerate, like Thursay and Converge. However, A.f.i., The Ataris, Lawrence Arms, Stairwell, Thrice, etc are all amazing bands with amazing songs on this comp. I reccommend it."
3,Not as comfortable as it looks,"This chair looks very comfortable, and they probably would be more comfortable if I were about 10 inches shorter. They are very nice looking chairs and look good on our front porch, but we don't use them very much because they seem a little small when you sit in them."
4,Meet the boys from the strike team,"Can get enough Mackey? Then I suggest you pick this book up, it is a who's-who of Shawn Ryan's groundbreaking cop series. Also contains an episode guide for seasons 1 and 2."
4,A STAR IN THE GHETTO,Just needed to convert my lp to the cd.I like the sound of Prince Phillip Mitchell
1,"JUNK - BEWARE, BUYER!","These are the cheapo Public Domain releases, barely VHS in quality.Horrible bad blurry pictures and sounds.NOT remastered. Check the Hitchcock DVD Wiki for the gruesome details (search daveyp)."
4,Worth the money,My little girl loves this durable toy.I love the convenience of storage-all the pieces fit in the little house-- and especially the fact that if anything is lost you can call a 1800 number and they will replace any piece.Worth the high piece.
3,"Creative fun, but quality lacking","This is a great idea for a toy that promotes creativity, reading, and independent play. My two year old loves this toy and loves to ""play"" the big bad wolf. This toy is great for travel as well. With that said, the quality of the brick house is a problem. It has not held up well to normal wear and tear. The velcro has fallen off, and so have both little yellow handles. The material seems rather cheap, and poorly secured. All the other pieces are fine. Finally, please keep in mind this is a creative toy that is meant for children, not babies who are still putting everything into thier mouths."
5,Del Shannon's 25 Greatest Hits,"This is one of the best CDs I have ever bought.Del's voice; just like Roy Orbison, improved and strengthened with age.Apart from all Dels 60s hits there are some really great songs on this CD.My favourite is Who Left Who, how this song never hit the charts, let alone make #1, is beyond belief.Compared with the machine music crap pushed out these days, this is a GR8 CD.Love it.Deckard"
4,Best I've found,"I have an entire collection of, ""Learn Russian"" books. I like this one the best. Some books just fit a learner better than others. I've used this book so much that it is literally falling to pieces."
1,anger,!!!HOW ANGRY I AM THAT THIS BOOK AT THE START OF LESSON 13 STOPPED TRANSLATING THE RUSSIAN INTO ENGLISH!!! I WAS LOVING THIS BOOK BUT THEN AT CHAPTER 13 THEY STOPPED GIVING THE ANSWERS SO IT WAS BASICALLY NO HELP WHATSOEVER!!! HOW COULD THE AUTHOR HAVE BEEN SO STUPID!!!
3,A primer where few primers exist,"As other posts have said, this book's main strength is that it gathers together methods from a variety of technical articles and puts them in one nice place. From that standpoint, it is a nice entry point into the field of performance attribution & to survey the landscape, as it were. It is clear & concise. But it doesn't have sophisticated or advanced treatment of any one subject."
3,"Tight, concise, pretty nice, right price.","This book is a super concise quick read on the subject. It covers the main points without boggling you with information overload on deatils. I wish it would show more chemical structure at times to make the logical of transformations more transparent;in the metabolism sections particularly. The graphics are minimalmistic, this mode is not exploited by the authors. It does not make much of an attempt to help you better understand the logic of the subject in the metabolism section. Overall I believe the book delivers what it promises. Still I wish there was a concise review book with good graphic displays, interesting writing that revealed the beauty and logic of the subject more. I give this book a C to B- overall."
3,Taylor Precision Products Jumbo Rain Gauge & Thermometer 2704,"Plastic and the thermometer didn't last a day, went to the top and stayed there never to return so that part of it was useless from then on. Rain gauge is easy to read with BIG large numbers. The slide on the side for keeping track of accumulated rain fall is cheap and sticks at the top end and is loose at the bottom end. Inexpensive being the key word here it is an alright product and does measure the rain fall but as i said mine is useless as a thermometer."
1,Very boring and dated,"Very boring and dated documentary. no music of faith hill, boring interviews with no name singers and very dated looks. waste of money!"
1,what a rip-off,"I have been buying from Amazon for years so I have grown to trust the quality of the products they offer. I was surprised to be stuck with a product that does not represent Amazon or Faith Hill. The DVD is completely outdated; the quality is below poor, actually an embarrassment. The DVD actually is not worth fifty cents. I was forced to give it one star in order to post my review. It is NOT worth one star. This is a perfect scam."
4,buen case pero un poco caro,El producto llego muy bien protegido contra golpes y a tiempo me hubiera gustado que el regulador de velocidad para el ventilador de los discos duros estuviera en un lugar mas accesible como el de los otros dos ventiladores ya que para poder subirle y bajarle velocidad a este ventilador hay que abrir el case aun asi no me arrepiento y lo considero una buena inversion tiene buen espacio ya que en el futuro tengo previsto tener tres tarjetas de video en SLI.
1,DOA,"Arrived broken in 5 places. I called Antec to replace broken part. Three weeks, two phone calls and two emails later I got the wrong part shipped to me. I ordered this case a month ago and I still have no functioning case - just a partly assembled case with no front panel. I am very disappointed. I will never buy from Antec again."
3,Holy Flamestrike! I think I am in Love!,"My friend Ed and I bought this book after a fine purchase of the game itself. After being PKed and loosing everything we work so hard to get in the adventurous game of UO, we decided this book may be are one and only answer. Well it was! It told us everything we needed to know! We read and read our brains out until school was long forgotten. Even good old Mr. N couldn't save us. My friend and I were feeling like UO masters until... a new client patch came and changed everthing around in the game, so the book had all wrong and old dated information. That is why I gave this book 3 stars. It is a well developed book to give you help in the game but since Ultima Online constanly uses patches to change everything (in there view for the better), the book becomes a useless puchase. Right now the book has only map use that is acurate with the game."
1,Game changed too much since this book was first published.,"When Ultima Online first came out this book was what every adventurer needed. However since then, the game has changed so much that the book will not help you much. It may still be useful for getting the absolute beginner to orient him/her self but not much more than that."
1,Outdated,The Book is totally outdated. The monsters you should encounter in Shame are long gone ! The armor ratings have changed a lot. The book may be useful for a newbie but it's no real help for a pro.
5,Great For Starting an Old-School Server,"For those who create their own servers using emulators such as RunUO, and hope to capture an old-school feel, this book is very useful at getting all the old stats and such down. Otherwise, its very out of date, and about 7 expansions behind...use only as a reference for a pre UO:R server, or to catch up on old times."
3,Good Helping Hand,"Ultima Online is dificult at first, it isn't really laid out for you like most MMOs, you just kinda do your own thing. Especially if you use UOgateway free survers it can be harder. At first I had trouble controlling my character. This book helped a lot, with maps and such. It's not essential, but if you need a push in the right direction I recommend it."
4,All Newbies Get This Book!,"Go behind the scenes with this book. This is a must for all newbies to the game. It explains the game in full detail, almost every part of the massive game."
4,perfect,"i bought this for my mom who has alzheimers, and its the only thing that keeps her attention because she loves horses. she remembers when she was young and had horses. its a lifesaver, perfect for mom!"
5,Amazing Instructional DVD,"I got this DVD because my girlfriend wanted to me to go out country dancing with her. Needless to say, I was more than a little nervous. I'd always been a little rusty with my foot work. Thanks to this DVD, however, my confidence level has gone through the roof. I can now say that I'm the one dragging her out to go dancing ;-) I can't get enough of the moves I've learned and am anxious to learn more! Great instructors and professional video quality make this DVD an excellent teaching source!"
5,Awesome!,My girlfriend gave me this video along with Volume 2 for Christmas. Her and I have always been into swing dancing and this gift was perfect for us! I absolutely love this video! It helps me with the technical side to swing dancing. I am not a very skilled dancer and haven't been blessed with the ability to keep a great rhythm but this video helped me a lot! Great instructions and easy to learn and follow! 5 Stars!
5,MindyR,"This video was just the thing we were looking for. My friend and I were probably the worst dancers in our group, but not after this video! The couple was fun to watch and went through the motions very well. They went slow enough so that you could get the move down, but fast enough so you were on to the next steps and not left repeating yourself and getting bored. We even ended up teaching our other friends a thing or two by the end of the night."
2,"Nice bag, but....","The vendor did ship the bag in a very timely manner which I give them 110% kudos for. However, when I received it,I really disliked the color of the bag. I emailed and requested a return authorization. They didn't respond for several (five) days, so I emailed them back and they responded after the second request.They emailed me back with a FED EX ground shipping pre-paid label, which I really didn't expect. I thought this was awesome customer service, as I really did expect to pay for the return shipping.Overall, they provided good customer service and sold a nice product. I just wish it would have been a nice chocolate brown color!"
3,IT IS NOT LIKE THE PICTURE!,"This bag is very bad made, in the picture I couldn't see the details of twisted seams, the leather is so weak that it seems to be broken simply by touch, the handles are not straight and i do not find a way to straighten them. It looks cheap. And the material in general is poor and low quality. I don't recommend this product."
1,purse,This purse is not leather as the ad states. It is very inconveniently designed as well. The large center strap is hindered by the two shoulder straps. My largest dissappointment is the platic fabric the purse is made of.
1,"Worthless, worthless, worthless.","I felt compelled to comment after I saw the positive review here. This can in no way be considered good, funny or even mildly amusing. Most of the ""name"" actors look embarrased with the notable exception of Modine, who gives his all in a pointless performance. I have no idea how any of the actors were persuaded to join this sinking ship, but it's painful to watch and I wouldn't waste my time or money on this dud."
1,A Complete Disgrace,"The Shipment was one of the most unfunny comedies that just did'nt seem to work out at all.Only the beginning was a bit funny with Steve Bacic in it,But if you want real action and real comedy,better get use to The Medallion instead of this garbage."
4,The true story of Hugh Glass...and then some,"I had never even heard of Hugh Glass when i picked this book up. Wow, what a life he led! If even half of it is true its an amazing tale in the spirit of Jeremiah Johnson.What this man goes through is unbelievable and makes for a heck of a page turner. Great historical/fiction mountain man story."
4,Lord Grizzly,I ordered the book for my husband. He has finished reading it and enjoyed it. Thanks for offering it for sale.
4,Insightful!,"My role as at IT/Business consultant often presents me with sales-like situations, and the information and advice in Ms. Wheaton's book will definitely be useful to me. I loved her 'no-nonsense' style of writing. It was refreshing to read some truly practical advice for a change! I've read a number of other books that purport to teach you successful sales techniques, but none of them hold a candle to what is presented in this on. I've participated in a number of 'Sandler' seminars and training sessions over the years, and while I think a lot of the basic message is similar, the delivery and simplicity of Ms. Wheaton's approach makes her message easier to digest. Thank you!"
5,kimbalmania!,"This is a wonderfull listen! Happy to have been to many of kimballs live sets in Orlando! kimball is a touring dj why not check to see if he's coming to a town near you. Great live and always good cd's. Good Luck Kimball, say hello to stacey!"
2,This CD Is Not Life,"While Kimball Collins is one of my favorite DJs to see live, this CD was dissapointing in many aspects. While the tracks are decent songs, this album lacks the intense and thrilling feel I used to associate with Kimball Collins. As with most of the new releases currently in the scene, it seems that DJs are attempting to validate their style to the mainstream... No really moving feeling here."
2,The Weakest,"This is very disapointing to me, because Kimball got me hooked on trance with ICU Session 1. But this album is different it's progressive, not that prog is bad but this album [...]. There's only a few good songs and they were on albums from last year. I think Kimball is leaning towards this type of progressive due to the success of Tiesto and Ferry Corsten. But his attempt is a sad one. People say Generation 2000 is his best, but i think that it [...] too. I saw Kimball in August and even his performance was disapointing, i mean it was being advertised on the radio and it was over sold so the floor was filled with non-dancing nerds. I waited for the chance to see him live since the first time i heard ICU Session1, but it seems he's lost his love for music. It appears that he only loves the money now."
2,Another pretty much worthless compilation!,"Has anyone noticed lately that Kansas is totally going mad with every sort of compilation? Maybe they're trying to cash in, but I don't think too many people are going out to purchase these kind of compilations. Why go out and buy this when the albums that these tracks come from are so good. Just go out and buy LEFTOVERTURE, MASQUE, MONILITH, KANSAS, and POINT OF KNOW RETURN (POKR should have gotten at least four tracks because it's the greatest album that they've ever made, but instead they give it one lousy track). Just go out and buy the whole albums that these tracks come from. Believe me they are ultra superb albums and some of these tracks from them are the wrong ones to include. ""It Takes A Woman's Love"" shouldn't have been included because it's not classic Kansas to me. Just get out to the stores and buy the great albums that these tracks came from and you'll thank me, I promise."
5,Sun Dancer,"Caught between the once proud heritage of their grandfathers world, and their longing to be be re-united with the land that is the spiritual center of their culture,the charactors in David Londons Sun Dancer will take you into life as it is today on the reservation in the Amrican southwest.I highly recomend this book. Thank you David !"
3,Native American anger novelized,"I found myself reading through this novel quickly and thought it was quite entertaining and educational. Many readers will probably find the politics of the book somewhat one-sided, but this does not ultimately detract from the frank assessment of Native American life on the reservation and their ongoing anger over past injustices. I found the characters to be poorly fleshed out in many cases, but the plot is interesting and well developed. As a change in pace and a chance to learn more about Native Americans, this novel was well worth it."
4,SPIRITUAL and FAST,"One of the best books I've read in years.The plot moves fast and you find yourself caring a great deal about these characters. Clement is extraordinary, and yet he feels completely real and believable.I love Joey's narration--sly and seemingly cynical but also open to the possibility of higher things being at work. And how can you not love Linda?When you think of what has happened to the Sioux, you wish everyone would read this book, which seems to call for a touch of justice It's also a hell of a ride."
1,The first problem with this book is the premise,"In this novel London takes events that happened a few decades back andsets them in the present day. This is a very difficult thing to do.The author must take into consideration changing attitudes andpolitical climate. In this London fails miserably. For example, hedepicts FBI raids [that seem based on] Mathieson's ISOCH (whichtook place in the '70s) and sets them in the late '90s. While I willadmit that I have only a passing acquaintance with the Pine Ridgereservation, I do keep abreast of Indian Country politics, and itseems to me that both Native American political leaders, and the USgovernment have become a lot more sophisticated in their dealing witheach other over the past 10 years or so.A poor premise can stillmake a good book, however, if it is well written. This is not. Thecharacter development is very poor. London also jumps from event toevent, leaving some important pieces dangling when they becomesuperfluous to the plot...."
3,Good but not Great,"This is the Toy Box my daughter in law wanted for my grand daughter, so it was loved, but it was smaller than she had hoped for. I checked all over the site to find the size before ordering but couldn't. I did check the manufacture's page and they said the size was much bigger than it actually is. It was the same product number as the one I ordered."
5,More Than Short,"In this collection of short stories Alice Munro offers perfect slices of Canadian life, and while some may find the characters and their situations depressing, I find Munro's world inspirational in its universality. She shows that people are people, and that is what is on display in these works.The stories explore the ""rustic,"" without being ""twangy,"" and Munro has captured the essence of the contemporary common Canadian woman.Highly recommended..."
3,A bit disappointing,I am not too sure what to say about this collection of short stories. While Munroe give amazing depth to the stories I found that there was very little movement in the stories and they seemed merely to describe various incidents in the lives of some interesting people. The writing is clear and crisp and there are some beautifully described insights that bring one to a stop in the middle of the page to wonder and reflect on one's own life.Overall though I found that this book was not up to some of her other writings. 3.5/5
2,One Writer's Slice-of-Life Collection,"I was barely familiar with Alice Munro when I bought this book, and I read only a handful of her prior short stories, so please read my comments with that in mind. Reading this collection last weekend I kept feeling my mood was never going to be allowed to brighten. (It didn't help that it rained). The writing was skillful and the insights into character were interesting, but I thought the subject matter leaned too far to the depressed side of life with characters whose burdens were much too heavy to share the same book. Men didn't come off very well at all. This is not a short story collection you pick up to be entertained, however, it could provoke lots of discussion and thoughtful conversation. As in life, the endings of Munro's stories ended at points that were often unsettling. I can understand that, but I still didn't like it."
3,An Antidote for Insomnia,"Word by word, phrase by phrase, sentence by sentence ... a great wordsmith. I just kept waiting for something to happen. After three attempts at reading it and falling asleep, I gave up, returned the book to the library, and went back to my latest New Yorker. --- The title intrigued me; the reviews suggested an inspired read; the author sounds like she has lots to say; I was disappointed not to make the connection ... maybe next year."
3,CREATIVE READING BUT LACKS SUBSTANCE.,"To the book's credit, the stories contained in this book are once again original, as is the custom with Alice Munro. That is what earned the book the three stars it received. On the downside, the stories were somewhat dull and the characters weak. With one or two exceptions, most characters came across as aging individuals, far older than their years. Love is beautiful at any age but from a psychological point of view, the characters' actions and words do not appear to fall in line with what we are told of the personalities of the individuals. Some may find the book inspiring, and the majaority of stories had a great deal of potential that simply fell short when it came to character development. The stories are interesting to a certain degree but it is not likely a book that will ""set the world on fire"" and long be remembered."
1,Disliked the Book,"I purchased this book because it sounded interesting. I'd like to hear why anyone liked it. In fact, after I read each story I had to go to the book cover: ""Oh, that was what it was about.""I didn't ""get"" the great revelation at the end of ""Family Furnishings."" Was Alfrida the college student's half-sister? Sometimes I had to re-read paragraphs to understand if it was past, present or future. All, in all, Alfrida was the only character who ""came to life"" on the pages.I guess I just chose the wrong book to order this time."
3,Old School Themes....,"This was my first Munro book and I'd looked forward to reading it because I had heard what a great writer she is...sadly I was really disappointed. It was a totally boring book. The themes of the stories did not have any pathos or touch my heart at all. While Munro is clearly a skillful writer, her themes are old school typical western middle class stuff. So what someone had an affair and stayed married? There was no insight or wisdom offered by the stories--just renditons of seemingly mindless situations. Luckily we have Maya Angelou!"
4,Interesting,"It was interesting. It wasn't exactly what I tried tried to order, but it wasdifferent. I watched it with my mother as she lives for flowers and plantsand she knew some of them in the movie. My parents have been to Europe, butthey didn't see this particluar place. The narrator's accent was a littlehard to understand, but we still watched it."
2,messed up my taste buds,"This product arrived quickly and as far as I can tell it was intact and as advertised. But I used a few drops mixed in a glass of water last night as a mouth rinse and not only did it make my mouth ache for at least 30 minutes after using it, today my throat was sore (maybe related) and everything I eat and drink has a strange bitter taste (definitely related). It's been 24 hours and everything still tastes weird. Kind of like that taste when you drink orange juice after brushing your teeth. It's a bummer! Here's hoping it's all better tomorrow. This stuff is definitely not going into my mouth again...I'll keep it around for external use."
2,Snake oil for sinus infections,"There is no hard evidence showing gse actually inhibits microbial growth, thus adding it to a sinus flush isn't going to make it more effective. All it did was leave my sinus slightly smelly. I suggest a low (1-3%) concentration solution of hydrogen peroxide instead. That will actually kill off infections."
1,It Doesn't Seem The Same,"The old GSE had an astringent bitter taste that was quite noticeable. But, it worked very well..especially for colds. A few drops of this in OJ with a cold would pretty much knock it out. It also lasted a longtime. When I went to replace an old bottle, the ""new"" GSE had a sweet taste...like concentrated grapefruit JUICE. I called the company and they said that they changed their supplier for the GSE. They swear that the sweet, weak tasting product they are selling now is the same. I don't think so. Buyer beware."
3,Nutribiotic is ok.,"I not sure if this is working or I want to believe it is working. I can't use it for myself because of the medication I take but I do use it in my laundry. I put at least 20 drops in a load of clothes. Other than that, that's all I use it for. I wouldn't recommend it as I don't see any big results. What's it's used up I won't buy any more."
3,Not Natural - but Works,"GSE works VERY well for everything it says it works for... however the title is misleading and it is NOT natural. GSE gets its benefits from pesticides and some nasty added chemicals. Good to have in the medicine cabinet, but should be used sparingly and with a very good refrigerated probiotic just like any other antibiotic."
2,How safe is this in the long run? What are the inactive ingredients?,"I am hesitant to purchase this, that means I have not used it. However, I have to put a star rating. I usually do some research before I purchase something like this online. The inactive ingredients are not listed, a lot of these GSE products which have demonstrated efficacy were due to high levels of preservative that is actually harmful to the body. Please read the following articles as it explains it better than I can. Hope this will help you make an informed decision.[...][...]"
2,Works until it bends,"Judging by the pictures it appears the design on the top of this unit has changed.It once had a flat circle (coin) welded on the top to push the plug out. Well the plugs are so tight that you do have to hit it with something to get them out. After doing that about 10 times the weld on the flat circle broke so now I have nothing to push on to get the plugs out. Also the Flat plate that actually forces the plug out has bent. If this unit was only $10.00 I would say no big deal. However, it's not $10 so they should use some better steel / welds on this thing so it will stand up to real yard soil. If those problems were fixed I would give this thing 5 stars."
4,Great Product,"After receiving my Yard Butler Sod Plugger I was at first disappointed. Even though the ground was well watered, I still had trouble penetrating the red clay soil. A little sharpening at the grinding wheel took care of the problem. Make sure that you have cut the lawn as close as possible without scalping. This is a trial process as far as how much watering to do, to wet and you are working with mud, not enough moisture the ground will be to hard. When you find the correct balance the product does as described. With everyday watering for two weeks the plugs will begin growing."
3,Sod Plugger? Not...Sprinkler Cleaner...Yes!,As a sod plugger you need to water the heck out of your St. Aug lawn to get these plugs to work. I prefer the sheets of grass and plop them down to take root. But for the longest time I needed a tool to clear the grass around my sprinkler heads and this is where the Sod Plugger works great!Just place it over the sprinkler and start turning from side to side and then remove the grass and dirt from around your sprinkler head! Now my St. Aug grass will never prevent the sprinkler heads from popping up again!Works great!
3,Just OK,Overall I have been disappointed with the Yard Butler SP-33 Sod plugger. My main complaint it is hard to discharge the plugs from the unit.
2,disappointed in this tool,"Very hard to cut a plug even in damp ground,even harder to eject the plug. I decided a sharp shooter shovel is better for me."
3,Its ok but there has to be a better one ouot there,"OK so this is my second one with this design. It has a flat part on top of rod which is an improvement from the first so that you can hit it with a hammer. However, the rod/ plunger is smaller in diameter and mine already is starting to bend. I will say my soil is clay and if it goes a few days without rain then it does become harder and I am plugging Zosia.The plugger does do a nice job cutting into the grass but they need to design getting the plug out better. My neighbor and I will make some minor mods to improve the design and I am sure it will work much betterEven though I knew it was not great, I did buy it because of price and I knew how to improve the design with a little welding so overall not too bad"
3,Doesn't cut deep enough,"I have a really thick St. Augustine (Floratam) lawn that was grown entirely from plugs. I've had mixed results with this tool, but more times than not the plug I cut doesn't come out of the ground. The problem seems to be that it doesn't cut a deep enough hole to sever the roots so when I cut (stepping on the bar) and then pull up, the plug often stays put. I try wiggling and cutting more and at various angles but in the end I often have to reach under and yank the plug out by hand. On a few occasions where I took the plug from a less thick part of my yard it worked as expected; however I prefer to take my plugs from the thickest and healthiest part of my yard.I suspect this would work well on other varieties of grass better than Floratam. The tool is well made and seems sturdy enough to last a long time. I just wish the cutting blades were longer to make deeper cuts in thick grass."
3,Yard Butler SP-33 Zoysia Sod Plugger,does a good job of removing a plug sized hole in the yard but does not do well cutting that same plug in a piece of sod.
1,Doesn't work,Total waste. Not user-friendly. I am computer savvy but this software is not logical. Just a ripoff.
5,aWESOMEE BOOK,THIS Book is great! answers a lot of deep questions. kenneth hagins is a veryy great man of God. this book clarifies lots of wrong notions i used to have. a must read for every christian that seeks to learn more about the way God works
4,"""My Sister's Keeper"" is a Keeper","This is the first book I've read by this author but when I saw it on Amazon.com and read the reviews it piqued my curiosity. I really enjoyed reading ""My Sister's Keeper"" by Mavis Applewater. The way the author developed the characters made them seem real and understandable. By showing the thinking processes of both Jenny and Lizzie(Sr. Rachel) made them seem like people I might have known in my life. The intimacy in the book made me want things to work out for Jenny and Lizzie. There were just enough suspenseful twists in the plot that I couldn't stop until I'd finished reading the whole book. My poor little dog had to wait until I got to pauses in the action for me to take her for her walks! Now I want to see what other works Ms Applewater has written will interest me. If characters in other books are as well developed as those in ""My Sister's Keeper"" I'm sure they will capture me as well."
2,pretty unsatisfying soundtrack save one man...,"Two words... Rufus Wainwright...Soundtracks (like Ben Siller/Will Farrell movies) are typically hit or miss, but when the divine Rufus Wainwright is thrown into the mix, it's always a hit."
4,An Upbeat Soundtrack,"An upbeat collection of music from the upbeat hilarious movie, where ""up"" and ""beat"" are equal partners. This is fluffy pop music with a strong rhythmic backbone, suitable as backdrop for action secquences and catwalk performances of your own. This music will make you want to strut your stuff, if nothing else. There are one or two quirky selections in the material that keep the album from devolving into dancemix monotony. But even those numbers that are danceable in a nouveau noir club kind of way have more soul and interest than your typical club mix. Most people will find no new material in this collection, but will greet each selection as a long lost (or even familiar) friend."
4,"For most, worth it because of the wiseguys","""start the commotion"" the slowly rising in fame song that was first heard by most Americans on a car commercial, and on all Zoolander previews, will be enough of a reason for many people to buy this soundtrack. Some of the other songs are revivals, such as ""wake me up before you go-go"" and ""beat it"" which no one really can tell how they will float this time. The Wallflowers are always worth a listen, and this soundtrack could give a good introduction for many people to Powerman5000. Hope you enjoy it!"
3,Listened once,this was a Cd that my son's teacher played over and over in the classroom. My son wanted it for home. We got it and played it once and my sone lost interest. Oh well. Kids can be fickle.
5,Catholic priest biography,This is a very interesting book. It mentions Abraham Lincoln and how this priest met him. I would recommend this book as good reading. There are some passages in French.
2,Difficult to read,"This is an exact photocopy of pages of the original book. It is thick, difficult to hold, if you like reading anywhere but a table. I would much rather that they would have re-set the type on it. While this is not an abridged version, I can see why people like the version put out by Laymen's Ministries [...]"
1,A classic of american anti-catholic bigotry,"I read this book, on internet.It's avaliable free.Even free, I didn't finished it.This is a bad book.At first, this book has so many frauds, that I can't number, the lies in a single chapter.To exemple, this book claims that a jesuit/catholic plot was responsable for the murder of the american president Abraham Lincoln, who is an absurd.In fact, the man who murdered Abraham Lincoln, John Wilkes Booth, never was a catholic.In fact, Abraham Lincoln never was a Pope's foe.At the same time, this ridiculous book never talks about the money's scandal, who really retire the author from Roman Catholic Church.Also this book never tells nothing, about bad things like Jim Crouwn laws, linching, genocide of indians and other bad things at that time of american history."
3,Watch out!,"This is probably a great book if you're interviewing for an entry-level or medium-level position. But be careful if it is for a higher-level position......First of all, Mr. Hoffman points out that you should either chose ""1"" or ""5"" because testers like the extremes. At higher levels, it appears the testers don't need extreme points of view on all things. In fact, it might suggest inflexibility. But he is right that you should not chose ""3"" for everything either.Secondly, Mr. Hoffman suggests you choose ""5"" in all things relating to Extraversion if the job you seek is in sales or directly related to sales... However, the test I took interpreted my selecting ""5"" on Extraversion as me having a massive Donald-Trump-sized ego. In fact, the test results did not even have extroversion as a category.My suggestion is buy the book to understand why people use the test, but be honest about yourself. Who wants to test into a position that is incompatible with your personality anyway?"
2,Pass On This,"Packaging looks nice but after opening, the ""laptop"" part gets set aside and never looked at again, you are better off opting to buy markers, paper, etc separately - much better value. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Just buy crayons and paper,"We got this for our son for Christmas and it fell apart the same day. It falls apart when you try to close it and the plastic thing that the markers are supposed to go in are too much for small kids to deal with. Would be much more economical and practical to just buy crayons, paper, etc."
4,Olive Tray,I love the whole Pistoulet collection and the quality of it. The only downside to this piece was the size. It was a bit small for my liking. Other than that another perfect piece for those collecting this dinnerware.
3,Price great game not so,My daughter loved the look and appeal of the game but got bored with it very quickly the price and service of seller cannot be beat
5,Should be required reading,"This book is excellent and would benefit anyone working with or parenting an individual with Down Syndrome, Even many of the younger ones. I can see my daughter in many of the situations and some have occured for many years and I did not realize that it was so typical.It reassuring that some of the actions and behaviors we see are quite similar to others."
4,It works - it's a must have - but not my favorite,"If you have more than one kid, you need a headphone splitter. It's worth it, but I'm not sure this is ""the one"". It is a ""bit"" flexible, but not as flexible as my other ""Y"" style splitter. I think some flexibility is a must. That said, because there is less than the ""Y"" style one that has less rigidity, the interference caused by sometimes pulling on the cords seems reduced. I think this would be better if it maintained its flexible shaft but incorporated a little ""Y"" in its design. Also, I am going to be a parrot and say - the packaging is pretty horrendous. Just use scissors - don't bother with the tab in the back.Bottom line: it works, with some improvements. I found it bulkier due to its rigidity and length and for purse or ipod pouch carry, too bulky. I will stick for other styles for that. It's great for the ipad."
3,Works great but Package is horrible,"This has the classic multilayer hard/sharp plastic packaging that is frankly dangerous to open. There is a easy tearout panel in the back that made me think it would be easy to open but it got me nowhere. Trying to wrench the relatively large case withing a case open resulted in sharp dangerous plastic edges and lots of frustration.As for the splitter itself, it is of high quality flexible material. It works great in my android even with a thin case on it. Not sure if it would work with a thicker case. There is no nasty smell that can accompany some of these type plastic/rubber items.If they would repackage this, I would give it 5 stars."
2,broke after 5 months,"This worked fine for about 5 months, now it shorts out, so music comes through only one earbud (regardless of which of the 2 splitter inputs is used). Squeezing/bending the splitter fixes the 2nd channel, but only while holding it in that position. Usually had in my shorts pocket, so not a lot of stress on the cable. Due to this problem, I would not buy this product again."
4,Quality splitter,This is a quality product. I have used it several times now and have carried it in my bag. It is constructed to last and not easy to break.The only thing that I don't like about it is the length. I would have preferred if it was smaller.
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!!,"THESE ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS. If I had known this, I obviously would not have bought it. What a shame that Amazon chooses to keep this information from it's customers."
2,Some of These Aren't the Original Recordings,"This has a lot of great songs on it. The problem is that some of them are not the original recordings. Most of them are, but there are some rerecorded songs. ""My Boyfriend's Back"" is an example of this. It sounds awful."
3,mirror mirror on the wall,"not that you would read this book for leisure - laying on the beach, hoping to indulge in some fantasy world - but all in all, the way it makes you think has a certain attraction. kind of complicated and somewhat unrelatable if you're not already up on other theories that Chomsky bases his own ideas on. awesome exploration of language and its correlation to the human mind / body. good for research or studying."
1,Stay away from this battery hog,"I purchased the camera over a year ago and have been living (don't ask me why) with dismal battery life problems since day one. You're lucky to get 10 pictures out of the two AA's. I called service and they told me for $25 to $50 they would diagnose the problem and update the camera to fix the battery drain problem, which they know about!!! Why did I wait for the warranty to run out????? Stupid.... It's my last Fuji, I guarantee you that."
5,Great Value,"Low noise, clean CCD panel in this inexpensive rig. I bought this for my college-bound son and I've been very impressed with the quality of the results. I'm a serious photographer and darkroom enthusiast and I've been concerned about the mediocre results from affordable digital P&S's. After some research, I decided to give the A700 a try via my son and it stands up to the reviews very well. Get a large memory card and run it at maximum res and you should be very pleased with the typical-duty snapshot results you get from the Fuji."
1,Video Clips are limited to 60 seconds,Another Fuji suprise. Most new cameras do not have a limit on videos other than the amount of storage on the xD chip. Nice camera other than that BAD limitation.
2,Not the best digital camera,"This camera takes nice pictures; however, the battery life is not that great and not too many other batteries are compatible with it. I'm not too happy about that. Also, the software is not working with my laptop, therefore, I have been unable to share pictures with others.Hope your experience is better than mine!"
1,Do NOT buy this camera,"My wife and I own a digital camera already, but she needed a point-and-shoot for a class she's taking. We got this camera, and after just a couple of months, it quit working. The camera comes on, and we can do everything (review pics, zoom, change menu settings) EXCEPT take a picture. When we push the shutter button, the camera turns off. After searching the web for a solution, I've discovered that many people have this problem, there is no apparent solution, and no information forthcoming from Fuji.Don't take my word for it, check out this ""find help here"" site.[...]"
4,Great little Camera,This is a point shoot Nice clear pictures easy to use out of the box. But don't expect much out of the 99 cent AA batteries they give you.I downloaded the Manual before the camera arrived so i would know what controls to use.While this camera is not packed with features (its one reason i bought it) many cameras just stack on useless stuff average point shooter camera will never see used.For price they should have included say a 128 meg XD card but other than that i love the camera so far..
2,Value priced but lacking in quality.,"I just returned my A700 after trying it out for two weeks. The reason for the return was the quality of pictures. The pictures are o.k. at best but for most of the them they were too grainy. I adjusted all the settings and maximized them for the best picture quality. The image quality was not there. My older Olympus 3.5MP camera produced better images than the A700.Although I read some of the reviews and the overall rating for this camera was low, I was still inclined to pick it up based on the camera specs and the low price. I learned my lesson as most of the reviews and overall ratings are a good marker to go by.I picked up the Canon PowerShot SD600 which was a little more but well worth it!Pros:Price7.3MP CameraNice sturdy compact designEasy menu interfaceCons:Picture resolutionVideo resolutionVideo recording lengths"
3,Dts track can be way out of sync,"On my copy of this DVD the Dts track was way out of sync - over 20 seconds ahead of the picture. Naxos was contacted but was not very helpful. The stereo track, on the other hand, was quite all right. I do not know if all the DVDs of this opera are the same. Buyer beware & check yours early!"
1,Skip ths one,"Dr. J. J. Kregarman is correct in his comment that the video is out of sync. Our copy purchased in late November 2008 is similarly defective. No great loss as the singing and staging are way, way below that of another easily available dvd by EuroArts conducted by Gelmetti, directed by Hampe staring Del Carlo, Hall, Rinaldi and the always appealing David Kuebler."
4,Clues to the past,"After the Fact is a very usefull book for students of history. After the fact uses case studies to examin different aspects of history. For example a chapter called The Visible and Invisable worlds of Salem looks at the Salem witch trials from 4 different points of view. The new fifth edition has chapters on what cupboards, clocks, quilts and other daily items can tell us about the early American Republic. The book is a very easy read and can be used to incoruage discussion in a classroom setting."
4,After the Fact: The Art of Historical Detection,"My son needed for school quickly. On back order in all area book stores. Good price, excellent condition,fast delivery. Thank you."
4,Great information for all homeowners.,Ortho's All About Perennials is very helpful and thorough. It is especially good for new home owners for taking care of existing plants and what is good for planting in the way of new perennials. We had these books and found them very helpful so I just purchased a set of Ortho's All About books for our son-in-law since they just purchased their first home.
1,This is a Total ripoff!,I have been watching these online and I would have to say this set is only worth 40 dollars not for the price they are asking here. The reason The first Black Scorpion movie had police cars wiping out and the same cars were used in every episode on this set including scenes used from other episodes Roger Corman's best work yeah right more like Cheap work! Not worth the money for such a cheaply made show!
5,Incredibly Entertaining!,"This is a great show and a wonderfuly packaged box set with great extras. Yes it is incredibly cheesy, but that's what makes it so fun! Michael Lintel is BEAUTIFUL, Scott Valentine is perfect as her partner, the villans are classic campy comic book characters, the vixens are too and are HOT, ADAM WEST ROCKS, FRANK GORSHIN IS AWESOME, and the writing is extremely fun and humorous. Check out Black Scorpion the movie and Black Scorpion II if you are a fan of the show. I enjoyed the films and fell in love with the show too. For fun escapist 'B movie' styled viewing you can't beat the Black Scorpion."
5,I love Jane Olivor,"The only thing better is Jane's live performances.I seen her live twice, this CD is great like all others."
1,Jane Olivor Completely Misses,"What a disappointment. I have always been a huge fan of Jane Olivor. When I heard she was releasing a Christmas album, I couldn't wait to get a copy - what a mistake.The album sounds like one big long constant note, unchanging and missing the life and power usually found in Jane Olivor's voice.There is just far too much Christmas music from which to choose for people to subject themselves to such a flat album. Unfortunately, something I thought would be thrilling is now headed for the trash."
1,Ephemeral Wanderings,"I am a student of the Mejican Revolution and this book purports to be about post-revolutionary politics in Michoacan. It has no theme or point of view and is merely ramblings about Mejican religion, land distribution to campesinos promised by Zapata, local politics and anti-clerical education.The diffuse and disconnected writing makes the book very easy to put down. If you are looking for history or historical analysis, this is not it."
4,been band but loved,My mom bought this popper toy eight years ago with my oldest boy now eight. The pop sound makes the adults of our house nuts (my dad and husband hate it) and the KIDS LOVE it. The rule is outside only. It had been outside many of seasons and losted in the garage a few more. I will be looking for it in my garage to clean up for my youngest.
1,Disappointed,"I ordered the Toddlerz Push Toy Corn Popper for a friend of mine whose daughter is turning one. I thought it would make a fun birthday present for the little girl. When I finally received it, I was disapointed to discover that the wheels didn't turn when pushed along the floor, so therefore, there was no corn ""popping"". Even when I tried to turn the wheels it was stiff, and I found that the wheels were misaligned. I think I'll find something else to send her."
1,doesnt pop,I would say buy this in the store so you can test it before buying it. I have to push down very hard to get it to pop at all. So it doesnt really work for the 1 year old it was purchased for. Very upsetting
4,a trick to make it pop better,"My daughter love this little toy. However, I found out that the wheel slips on carpet a lot and therefore does not rotate as much it should. The result is no popping. I found a nice little trick to solve the problem. The reason for slipping is the smooth wheels on this toy. So to increase friction with carpet or floor, I put two rubber bands (those friendship bands that you put in your wrist) on both wheels. The fitting is tight and now the rubber puts more friction with the floor. Viola!!"
5,we still have the one we bought in 1997...,"and it's still in excellent, durable condition. My then 12 mos old found it and just decided it was the best toy! For Christmas, his nana bought him one too! SO now he has two and he loves them both! He could play with it for about an hour and he's only 17 mos old. Just toddling it about like a little lawn mower. I do have to say that my other two children were not as interested in the toy. Maybe they were, but my husband and I would put them up because they are VERY loud."
5,It's a classic!,"Both of my children absolutely LOVED this toy as they were learning to walk. It's simple, classic fun - the more you sweep it across the floor, the more noise it makes as the balls inside ""pop"". My son started calling this a vacuum when he turned 2, and now every time I vacuum he races to get this toy so he can go over the floor while I vacuum."
5,Great classic toy!,"The style has changed a little since the one I had 30 years ago, but my son gets as much use out of his popper as I did mine.After reading someone's review that it was ""dangerous"" because her son was running into people with it, I realized that the toy does have an educational value. My son has been taught to use it without banging people, pets or walls, therefore it's educational!"
5,Classic toy!,This corn popper is just the same as the one I grew up with! I can't wait for my son to start using it- a true classic!
4,It's fun but...,It's fun but as a one-function toy fun does not last long. So the baby rolls it back and forth a few times then it's all over and off to another toy. It's an affordable little fun though. I'd buy it again
5,oldie but goody,"My 9 month old can't even walk yet to push this thing, but he already loves playing with it. I remember this toy from when I was a kid...same toy, same quality. I'm sure we'll enjoy this for quite some time."
5,POP POP!,This toy is just crazy fun. The little ones love to push it around and feel and hear the popping. Brings lots of laughter and smiles.
4,noisey fun!,"so noisey! but my daughter loves it. she has the pink one and loves to walk around in circles with this and pretend she is vaccuming the floor just like her daddy! it's so funny. she loves to say, 'pop! pop! pop!' as she walks around with it. it's so strange how kids love this thing! it keep she occupied for a little while at least!"
3,Toddler push toy,A great little push toy for toddlers. Sturdily made with popping sounds and moving balls in the dome to keep a toddler engaged.
4,History,This was my favorite toy as a child. 30 something years ago. My 18 year old daughter and her 8 year old sister both had one and my son (now 16 months) and my grandaughter both have them now. The Popper may not be much on educational but not all toys have to teach something some of them can actually be just plain fun to play with. An unmentioned extra is that if you have a child who lives with an ex-??? you can't beat the noise annoyance factor. LOLOLOLOL
3,For new walkers,"My son didn't use this toy much. He didn't find it stable enough to help him learn to walk, and once he could walk, he wasn't interested in pushing it."
2,1 year old twins are terrified of this toy,"Based on the fantastic reviews of this product I thought it was going to be a great hit. Wrong... the twins are terrified of this toy. They would literally startle/jump when they hear the popping noise. They have so far refused to have anything to do with it. They aren't typically timid or noise sensitive in most situations. The popping sound is very loud and sudden, so I can see how it can be anxiety provoking for a 1 year old unless it is used in a place with high background noise. Luckily it is a cheap item so I will hold on to it in hopes that it will make a good gift for another child some day. I will probably try to reintroduce this toy again in a few months, but seriously... The only thing they are more frightened of is the vacuum cleaner."
3,"real good deal, but No a good gift.","I can't complain if $6.00 for a new toy, but it looks like a used toy to me, and it doesn't comes with a product box, it is not a good idea for a gift."
2,Disappointed - wheels don't turn,I bought this for my 10 month old. He walks very well on his own already. He was excited when he heard the popping noise as I pushed it around and showed him how it works but for some reason he can't maneuver this toy by himself very well. Even at 11 months he's not able to do it although he walks perfectly on his own. I think it's because the handle is so narrow and the toy is light weight. Also on hardwood floors the wheels don't grip so it doesn't pop but rather just drags across the floor. I would take this back to the store if i could.
5,Baby loves it,"I got this for my 2 year old and she loves it so far. Unlike some reviews the wheels work perfectly fine. Also unlike some other people on here I didn't give it one star because it's ""annoying"", yeah sure it can get annoying sometimes but that's no reason to give it a low rating. Overall very happy I got this for her."
3,"Noise can be annoying, but my son loves it","My son received this as a gift when he was almost 10 months old, and even before he was walking, he loved to push it back and forth on the floor to make the popping noise. Now that he is nearly 14 months old, he loves to push or pull it all over the place. Most of the time, the noise isn't so annoying, but we have had to put it away at times because it's impossible to hear anything over the popping (and it certainly does nothing to help a headache!).I rated this toy 3 stars for fun because the noise can sometimes be too much, but my son would probably rate it 5 stars!"
4,Fisher Price Corn Popper,"Our son loves this toy. He takes it everywhere with him and loves to push and pull it. For the price it can't be beat. A classic that every kid will enjoy playing with, even though the sound of the popping might drive you nuts, it's worth it to see them so happy."
4,It's very Noisy but my son Loves it!!,OMG My soon to be 1 year old son absolutely loves this toy. The only problem is once he starts playing with it we don't hear anything else but the popping sound. If you are planning on getting this toy you might need some very loud headphones if you want to look at TV or listen to music while they play. Overall I think its a great toy!! The fact that it makes my son happy makes me gladly tolerate the noise.
3,Know Thy Child before considering this toy !,"This toy gets more ""time outs"" than any other toy in the house mainly because our rowdy little toddler likes to swing it around like a baseball bat and aim it at furniture, walls and even unsuspecting friends. Also, it is very noisy and usually is the toy of choice when Mommy or Daddy are talking to their boss on the telephone. So, I cannot recommend this toy to those families with little tornado toddlers like ours, but I am sure other children will have hours of fun with it - as I did as a calm little toddler once myself."
3,Not good for new walkers,"I bought this for my son when he started walking, and learned quickly that I needed to take it away and wait for him to walk better before he could use it. When I did give it back to him at 14 months, he really had no interest in it. I bought this because I remember having one when I was little."
1,Wheels don't roll,"I received this as a gift in July 2012. The corn popper that is currently for sale is very poorly made. The wheels DO NOT ROLL, on either carpet or on hardwood. I have a hard time making it pop when I am pushing it myself, exerting considerable downward force.My one year-old daughter is a great walker but could never get this going. She carries it around with her sometime, but I don't even think she understands what it is supposed to do.Additionally, the older models used to have a switch on the underside that could turn off the ""popping."" This switch is gone. When I called my Mom to complain that ours didn't work, she told me to check to make sure it was in the ""on"" position. When I let her know that no such switch existed she couldn't believe how much Fisher Price has cut corners to wreck a toy that used to be such a crowd-pleaser.Don't buy this unless you find an old used one at a tag sale."
4,Funand noise,My daughter recieved this as a gift when she was 12 months old. She only played with it a little until a year later. She loves making noise with it. Especially when someone is on the phone...
1,Fisher Price corn popper,I bought the Fisher-Price Corn popper for my grandson. The wheels are too tight and do not turn making the toy useless so I never gave it to him.
3,Not Good For Prewalkers,I got this for my little girl who was trying to learn to walk and it wasn't stable enough and kept slipping forward if she tried to use it for support. I ended up giving it away and buying another one that had four wheels and had better support for her body weight until she was able to walk on her own.
1,not pleased,This item came from amazaon through Toys r us -- it looked used -- it was dirty and it hardly pops... a big disappointment for my little one.
2,Poor Quality,"We got the popper that counts to 10, as a gift for our now, 3 year old. She didn't use it that much, but the counting was annoying and then stopped completely (not a bad thing). Sometimes the popper part worked and sometimes it didn't. It was really frustrating, so we put it in the trash.I won't be getting one for our second daughter."
2,I bashed my brothers head with this when I was young,"My brother got this toy one year when he was 5 and I was 8. It was so annoying, I grabbed it away from him one day and proceeded to bash him repeatedly on the head until my Mother took me over her lap and proceeded to give me a good old fashioned spanking. My brother was ok aside from some bruises and an intense fear of popping sounds. To this day you can NOT pop Popcorn around him without setting off a panic attack."
4,Old Fashioned Popper,"This toy is lots of fun for kids, they love the loud popping noise and it helped my kids like the vacum. It can be annoying after awhile but it is very durable and I recommend it because of how much fun the kids get out of it."
4,It's a Classic!,"My 19 month old son LOVES to push things around, especially if he can make them crash into furniture, siblings, the poor dog, etc. This toy sure fits the bill!"
4,"Pop, pop, pop","This toy was given to our daughter when she was 14 months old-she started walking right around then. She didn't really use it at first, because she couldn't lean on it to walk-it would fall, unlike her push walker she was used to. She took to it fairly quickly, though, and still loves it now. We say ""pop, pop, pop"" when she uses it and she's started saying ""pop"" when looking for it. The toy helped her learn to walk balanced as well as working on her talking skills!"
4,Can't believe these are still around!!!!,Bought this for my grandson. Amazed with Fisher-Price that they can keep making the same fun toys!! Not wood like the old ones but still alot of fun and durable.
4,Durable anf fun!,"What can I say? All the kids seem to love this toy. As soon as kids come in through the door - they grab this toy first. It has been through rain, snow, heat and it's still great!"
3,Old standard still has appeal...,"...but get out your ear plugs!! My daughter's grandma had fond memories of using this with my brother and me so she encouraged me to get one for Charlotte. C goes back and forth with interest (as babies tend to do with most toys!) but when she's really engaged, I'm SURE to cover my ears. This is one LOUD toy."
5,Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Corn Popper Push Toy,"It's an updated version of the classic one from years ago. Safe, sturdy and so much fun! My grandson loves it!!"
5,I remember these when my own kids were young,"This is a great toy to teach young kids to walk better. Thanks, Amazon, for having this for a grandson who was learning to walk."
3,Fun but noisy!,"My child LOVES this, but it's sooo hard to like it because the thing is so noisy! Did I mention that I have a newborn that's a light sleeper? Needless to say, my toddler uses this toy as an ""outside"" toy so that the neighbors can hear it instead of my newborn. LOL. It's great fun but I'd recommend it for those who don't have to worry about other sleeping babies/children in the house trying to take their mid day nap. It's very durable though, being that it's an outside toy now, never has cracked or broken or anything, however, my daughter is pretty gentle with it. It can take sidewalks pretty good."
2,Just like the one when I was a kid,Super light - all plastic of course. Sometimes the wheels don't turn on our hardwood floors which mean the corn doesn't pop.Does not arrive in retail box. Open the shipping box and there it is.Think twice - it's noisy. We don't let him have it every day. :)
1,Item was USED!,"My father sent this (along with other toys) to my daughter for her 1st birthday. This toy that he bought off of Amazon.com was USED, even though he bought a new one. It was placed in an ill fitted box, with no sticker, tag etc... the plastic dome was all scratched up and the wheels were dirty.The toy itself would have been great if it wasn't used and dirty.EDIT: Got my replacement. It didn't look that great but at least it wasn't dirty."
1,Shame on you Amazon!,"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!! Beware of this ""sale"" item folks. What I received looked like a garage sale item I could have purchased for a quarter. The shipping box was way to big for this itme and it arrived half open. The item was not covered in plastic or anything else to protect it so it arrived scratched and dirty. These poppers are notourious for ending up looking scratched on the clear plastic cover, but only after lots of use. Well mine looks like it's been used for years. The handle was scratched and sticky as well. So sad since I'm supposed to give this as a gift. HORRIBLE!!!!!!!"
1,Amazon send me a used item,Amazon send me a used item. This item did not come with the original package. They send me just the toy.Not in the original factory packingDon't buy this toy from Amazon. I am sending this back to Amazon
1,would be nice if it wasn't ruined,This product arrived quickly and when I opened it the package/cardboard label was all torn. The item itself is scratched all over the dome. In particular it has two very deep scratches. I am beyond upset with this product. I'm sure it would be fabulous if it wasn't ruined
1,Dirty/Used!,"Bought this toy as a gift for my sister's little one...It came:- loose in an over-sized box- cardboard ""Fisher Price"" tag was scotch taped around the handle haphazardly- black scuff marks and scratches on the handle- scratches on the plastic dome- wrinkles in the sticker decoration that runs down the handleWay to fail Amazon. Disappointed."
4,For my grandchild...,"Not as well made as the one his Daddy used. My granchild will use the old one while visiting, still have it for comparison."
2,damage,"No me gusto que el juguete vino rayado, con golpes en la circunferencia plastica transparente, como si hubiese sido usado o hubiese estado en exhibicion en la tienda."
3,Cute but small,"I recieved the hamper from a friend who ordered on line. It's a very cute hamper, but very small. I would like to keep it, but there are bigger hampers out there for the price."
4,good binoculars,I purchased this binocular and knew before that when viewing something with small binoculars at very high mag you will get a dimmer image with some shaking if hand held. The unit is well put together and fun to use. Just at high mag you will have a better image in daylight. Highly recommended keeping the above in mind.
2,Tripod a must!,"Nice quality binocs but... With magnification this high the movement is also magnified extremely as well. Anything over the base power requires a tripod which takes away from the portability. A 25mm objective lense with this high of a magnification is like looking through a straw; NO field of view. If you want this much zoom, stick with a spotting scope (still need a tripod)."
3,Needed for School,"Required book for school.Have no feelings for it except that it helped me pass the course.Now, reselling - anyone interested?"
4,Pretty good,"I got these around half price on a Friday sale. I was worried that they might be too thick to work; that it might be difficult to get my foot into my shoe once they were inserted. They are thin enough to avoid this issue yet thick enough to do what they're supposed to do. They don't stay in the shoe well when you take your foot out, though, and tend to curl up. They also tend to curl when you put your foot in. Once you work around this, though, and eventually get them situated they are fairly comfortable. You don't notice any sort of miracle cushion, but you do notice a slight improvement. I got them more to replace the inner soles of my shoes that were wearing out (my favorite shoes that I just don't want to part with) than for the comfort factor. Except for the rubber-like friction that causes them to rub on your foot and not stay in place, I am happy with the purchase. They seem pretty durable and do provide a slightly noticeable cushion."
5,Good,Easy to cut to your size and very cushiony. I like to put the textured side down. I would consider ordering another pair to have a spare.
5,Oddly beautiful,"I nearly fell out of my chair when I began reading this collection. I then read it cover-to-cover in a single sitting. It is difficult to describe O'Connor's style, simply because it is so infinitely unique. ""Visceral"" is a start, but it falsely suggests an explicit rendering of detail and emotion. Rather, the stories are written with an odd, and even ethereal, detachment. Each story surprises and frightens you; and, as you finish one, you find that you must read the next. It is a strange spell. The characters seem so exaggerated, yet palpable and familiar. I do wonder why Flannery O'Connor isn't read more. Her writing is so taut and finely tuned; her stories disturbing, haunting, and ineffably sad."
2,A Cryptic Title,"Usually the title of a book gives the reader a clue as to the theme. Here the title describes a physical impossibility, since everything that rises obviously must diverge. Apparently the author received an inspiration for her book from the 19th century French Roman Catholic priest, Pierre Teilhard DeChardin who believed that all human cultures are converging to an Omega Point identified as Christ. Or as he wrote ""Everything that arises must converge"". What a difference a one word makes. It is odd that an author would make such an important error in a book title, completely destroying the theme of what otherwise is good writing."
5,Great read,"I'm not big on books that discuss racial conflicts, but Flannery O'Connor does so in a way that doesn't glorify either side, instead she admits all faults. She makes the reader aware that flaws aren't found in someone's skin color, but in their thinking. I haven't read many other stories by her, but because of this book she has become one of my favorite authors. Her symbolism is rare nowadays and thought provoking to say the least. I was suprised by the gore and shock in the stories, but loved it nonetheless as I think others who are looking for somehting enlightening to read, but don't have the time for long novels."
5,Read Aloud!,"Posthumously published, these stories begin with one of O'Connor's finest, the title story, and continue with variations on themes of redemption and unexpected grace. Reading them aloud enhances her incomparable humor."
2,I felt it was not a safe family movie,"There were a handful of sexual innuendos that caused me to take this movie off of our approved list. I don't need my boy encouraged to stare at Elle MacPherson's rear end or have busty secretaries with sexual connotations educating him on a ""family movie""."
1,Awful,"This movie was a total flop at the box office, losing millions, and deserved to. I saw it in the theater, and walked out in the middle it was so bad. It had no laughs, it was bland and dull, and Culkin gives the LAZIEST performance ever! He looks like he's ready for his nap in every scene. He's constantly blinking his eyes and never speaks above a monotone. His career died with this movie, and never recovered."
1,Unwatchable,If Richie Rich made this movie to make more money than by tomorrow he would be living in a cardboard box.This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen.Its so bad that it would make The Richest kid in the world vomit.A message to anyone reading this. Dont show it to Freinds!
4,Funny movie from when I was young,I watched this movie as a kid and enjoyed it. I purchased this DVD for my grandmother when her VHS copy broke. She is happy with it.
3,Fun movie to watch every now and then,It is a good movie just when you want something to watch without being very intense. That is all I have to say about that
3,Funky kids film,"This is based off the comic book of the same name, and is a very kid-friendly movie. At least, for older kids, but the comedy is more slapstick. I remember watching it on video when it came back then, and I liked it. Some adults might find this movie too corny for them, but it's a fun, light-hearted movie based off a silly but fun comic strip. Young Macaulay Culkin makes for a cute Richie Rich, though the role could have also been played well by a slightly younger actor."
3,Good family movie,"This movie is about the richest kid in the world who has everything but friends. As he learns to have a successful sociala life, a disloyal employee plots to kill him and his parents and take over the family business. With the help of his new friends, his faithful butler, Cadbury, and the inventor Professor Keenbean, Richie tries to locate his missing parents and save the family riches. The Professor provides many interesting gadgets, including a remote-controlled bee, a machine that makes bowling balls, and a sticky substance that is 1000 times as powerful as superglue."
3,Look at it from all sides,"It is my opinion that this movie was well done. I thought the cast carried their parts with alacrity and I applaud them for that. I always enjoy seeing MacCaulay Culkin in a picture--he is such an effortless young actor and yet his talent is monumental. Edward Herman is a delight as always. No, I simply don't agree that this is a bad picture. Hurrah for Richie Rich!"
3,Old but good for the kids,Has good values on being rich and shows that being greedy has a cost. Would recommend it for 6 and older.
1,Where's my Santana?,"I ordered this title back in January and still have not received it... What's the hold up?... I don't know, no one has reached out to tell me what's going on..."
3,Just a warm-up,"after hearing juelz on ""come home with me"", and Diplomatic Immunity"" albums, i could not wait for some solo juelz. i think that all dip set fans have waited a long time for this hot new rapper to come out with his own stuff. From Me to You is now out, his first main solo album. it awsome. but Final Destination is well worth the look. it's a street mix tape, hosted by dj kay slay, full of freestyles and maybe we should call it ""b"" side material. right away it cannot be compared to from me to you because of all the freestyles on this album. it lacks the depth of a great album, but showcases juelz talents as a freestyler. from me to you had much more depth and still had sick rhymes. if you buy this cd, remeber that it is just a warm up, not as good, different style, but well worth the look."
5,Awesome!,"I've been looking for something large enough to hold my many spoons, spatulas, tongs, whisks etc. for quite some time. Same as another reviewer, I've jammed everything into the holder I had for years trying to keep the utensils I use the most right at hand. When I found this on your site I was still skeptical but placed the order anyway. If nothing else, I could give it as a gift to someone. I was thrilled when it arrived. Everything fits with room to spare! I'm tempted to go shopping - there must be SOME utensils out there that I don't have yet!"
3,"Really, really big!","Measure carefully! I thought I had, but this was much too large for the space I had available. Had to return."
2,Too Tight - Attempt to contact them,I should have read the negative reviews. It hurts my normal-sized head to use them. I e-mailed them because I thought there might be a way to adjust the fit. No reply.
4,Glasses are cool but difficult to store.,The glasses are very cool. It surprises people that they pull apart right on your face. However I don't know what to do with them. I can't throw them in my purse because I don't have a case for them. Leaving them around the house is not a good idea without a case. I have resorted to hanging them near my computer. They need to come up with a convenient way for them to fold up and fit into a case.
3,larger size... please!,"would like to see a larger version for the ""big head"" people in the world. Mine barely fit and I rarely use them."
1,Too small for my big head.,"The durn things don't fit my large (7 3/4 hat size) head, even expanded aslarge as possible. This is very Disappointing."
4,CliC,"these are easy to keep up with, the lenses are good and are a comfortable fit. Super easy to get on and off. Only downside is they don't collapse to fit in a pocket or brief case easily so the only convenient place to carry them is around your neck, but that is why I got them so they are perfect when you need them on and off alot."
2,"nice idea, but several drawbacks","The glasses look very cool when they're hanging around your neck. They don't have that ""old lady"" look of traditional reading glasses dangling from a chain. I bought them in red, and the color is beautiful, a nice cherry color, not garish. I even had a young security worker at the airport ask me where I got them.However, even if you adjust them to the maximum size they'll only fit you if your head is on the small side and you're not wearing any sort of headgear that could interfere with them; even a ponytail or any sort of fullness in the hair could make the glasses too tight, and then they'll press painfully on your nose, if you can get them on at all. Even if they fit, they might rumple your hairstyle."
2,Need to be able to adjust for bigger heads.,"Glasses would be great, but need to be able to adjust for bigger heads. Don't think most men can wear them without popping the adjustable side frame off. Would buy another pair, if they would make the side frames a little longer."
3,a bit small,"I would love these glasses if they were a bit bigger.they are very stylish and convienient, but they are too tight.You need to make larger sizes."
2,Awkward Gimmick,"The glasses are well made but I found them awkward to use. They didn't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on. The gimmick sounded cool but didn't work well for me. Every head is different, so maybe they'll work better for you."
1,TOO SMALL ...DOESNT FIT LARGE HEADS!!!!!!!,My husband has a large head and these didnt even get near his nose! Big big disappointment!!!
5,Glad I bought them,I use these glasses all the time at work. They sure are handy. Glad I bought them.
1,Flimsy Middle School Level Book,"First this encyclopedia seems to be directed at middle school children. Second the book is not truly an encyclopedia as no subject is covered in-depth. You get a bunch of staccato blurbs on the different topics. I expected much deeper coverage of clockwork androids, however all I got was a single 5 sentence paragraph. Britannica this is not.Consider this a primer for younger children."
3,Buy it on sale,"I bought this on sale for $4.50. We have a purple one (for a 4 yr old girl) and an orange one (for a 4 yr old boy). They like the contents and the back section is a good place to store separate pieces of paper for them to draw on. However, it is WAY too hard for a 4 year old to open the case. Also, on the drawing surface there are two raised triangles with slots in them to help hold the pieces of paper, but only the plain paper that comes with the kit fits in the slots. They are too close together to hold regular 8 1/2 x 11 sheets of paper and they are too close to hold the dry erase activity sheet that comes in the kit. It comes with chalk but we don't find any sort of chalk board in ours. I would buy it on sale if you want a kit to keep in the car and you want to help your young child open it. I definitely would not pay the list price for it."
2,Too big and too flimsy for a little lap.,"I bought this for my grandson for his 5th birthday. It's very flimsy, and the paper holder is too small for standard 8.5 x 11 paper and the marker board it comes with. When you open it, it's too big for a little kid's lap, and the opened part on top tips away so it doesn't stay flat on the lap. It is a good idea with the storage inside, but not designed well. I don't think I will keep it. I don't want to frustrate my grandson. On the plus side, shipping was fast."
1,Review of The Gun Digest Book of Sporting Clays,"The book is a rambling collection of articles on sporting clays. A lot of the book is spent on shot guns but the information is often incomplete. For example in the section on ""Choosing your Shotgun"" in the Browning line of guns only Cynergy and Gold Sporting Clays are included. There is no mention of the Citori series of guns which are briefly mentioned in Appendix II which also includes some military and police weapons. Most disappointing is that there in no dedicated section on ""how to shoot sporting clays""."
2,cheap copy,"although in the description it was presented as a book, it does have a cover and a back the inside is a bad fotocopy of the original book. the prints of the paintings bij the artist are so bad you can not even see what they originally depicted."
4,Excellent beginner guide to sapphires and rubies,"Excellent explaination of what constitues value in these stones. Very nice explainations of cut and inclusions. Good discriptions of means for evaluating natural from synthetic stones. A couple more chapters on the more technical aspects of gem formation/classification might have been nice, but this is likely beyond the intended target audience. There is an excellent bibliography. This book alone will vastly improve ones confidence when shopping for these stones. The only real flaw is the scant number of color pictures. Color pictures are present, but more, especially for illustration of flaws and color quality would have been helpful. All in all this text easily rates a VVS2"
3,not what I thought it would be,"I thought it would be more novice type and no so technical. I wanted to learn how to spot the best stones, and qualify the stones I do have. I was not able to do that. David"
4,Now that Symantec has destroyed Powerquest products...,"Now that Symantec has bought Powerquest and succeeded in destroying their product line (PowerQuest Drive Image replaced with the inferior Norton Ghost, and Powerquest Partition Magic 8.x crippled with ""activation"" and other annoying anti-piracy measures), Acronis TrueImage becomes the best option out there.I'm using an earlier release, not 8.0, but I can recommend it wholeheartedly. A great product, well done."
3,"good product, lousy service","Product works well, much better than the customer service. Make that near non existent customer service. Was offered an upgrade for a price and then they refused to honor it. When customer service was contacted, they said they would call back. They did not. Very dishonorable company."
1,Freezes XP!,"This product simply did not work at all on my system. Could be because I had Roxio 7 loaded previously - I read during some resarch to resolve the problem that Roxio and Acronis have some issues if Roxio was installed. The Roxio uninstall leaves the registry loaded with keys, and I think these are the problem when Acronis tries to run. It seems to be something with the CD/DVD burning. On my system it spins up the CD burner, then hangs the whole system. You have to force terminate the program to regain control of the system. Needless to say, it was more software money down the drain for me. I would say that Roxio users should think twice before dropping cash on this mutt."
5,pistoulet,Another wonderful piece from the Pfaltzgraff Pistoulet collection. Perfect size for water. A must have if you are collecting this dinnerware.
5,Love this pattern--love this pitcher,"This is a nice, hefty pitcher--good looking on the table and a great addition to my collection of Pistoulet."
1,quite advanced and unhelpful,"This in no way deserves the classification ""intermediate."" I have studied Russian over two years, and can carry on simple conversations in Russian, but I cannot get through the first page of this book. Intermediate means like 2nd and 3rd grade readers, not college level."
4,Colorful Diversity,"Former supermodel Iman, now founder of a successful cosmetic line, focuses on the entire gamut of skin tones - from light to dark - with this quality coffee table book.Full of chapters on skincare and makeup, Iman also debunks the myths and provides insights from top beauties like Selma Hayek, Eve and Tyra Banks. Sure to be appreciated by all women of color - whether black, Hispanic, Middle Eastern or Asian."
3,cover is the best photo,"Well, she was a top model, knows a lot of people ... but she is not a makeup artist. There are some useful tips, but you can find better books."
2,Not a very explicit book. Better off purchase de Sam Fine DVD and/or any Bobbi Brown Books,"Not a very explicit book. Better off purchase de Sam Fine DVD and/or any Bobbi Brown Books. And if you are looking for mastering African-american skin makeup application and you love Iman, go to youtube and download her makeup products application videos, that will be more helpfull"
3,Interesting book but expected more...,"After all the positive reviews, i bought this book and thought I will learn some good techniques.I was a bit disappointed but the book itself is interesting,and Iman looks fabulous. THere is not much for asian type (chinese,japanese etc..). I was looking for something that will help me to enhance my asian eyes and that book was not for me, unfortunately."
4,Iman delivers...,Been meaning to buy this book for a long time. Glad I finally have it in my collection.
2,"Not the ""Ultimate"" Guide","In a nutshell, it is not worth the time and money to read. It is for beginners who want to put makeup on, but I wouldnt even suggest you buying it for that. Celebrity makeovers really take over this book. Thats it"
3,"Product Great, Shipping BAD","I love this book, however when it was shipped to me it was bent up. I suppose this is a shipping issue, however maybe the business should ship in a hard box or case rather than a flimsy envelope that allows the product to get damaged (paperbacks only)."
5,The Last Beauty Book,"Now that we have Iman's beauty secrets in a book, why will there ever be need for another Beauty Book. It is ""simply the best""!Her beauty radiates from deep within and it shows, and now for all women of every color she and her friends share the secret."
2,For the extreme novice,"This book was dissapointing. It's just so basic. I opened it once, put it under my bed and haven't looked at it since. If you're looking for new make up ideas, or pictures to inspire you, then this is NOT the book to get.."
4,This is a good book,"I bought this book as christmas gift to myself. This book tells of basic makeup application for the eyes, skin, lips, etc. It has different looks for you to try and it gives you instruction on how to apply it. I rated this book 4 stars because I thought their should have been more african-american women in our variety of colors, but the book is the the book of color. I have tried one of the looks and I can say I looked HOT!! Good for beginners."
1,This is unlike the traditional story and is mean spirited.,"If one is looking for a gentle version of the original Pinocchio story, look elsewhere. The animation is harsh, the characters hard and there is very little resemblance to the story that we grew up hearing. Pinocchio kills the Cricket, gets his feet burned, and Ghepetto spends time in jail. This is not a story that I would recommend for children."
1,Not worth the money,"This book is practically worthless. It is half filled with idiotic quotes from famous musicians about how wonderful the number system is. The Nashville numbering system is such an easy concept that you do not need any book, especially this one, to learn it. The author does not do a good job explaining the notations used in the examples. I cannot recommend this book to anyone."
4,Buy them now,The cutters and rubber cutting areas are getting really hard to find for this older but OK paper cutter. Better think about buying for the future.
2,easy but hard,the mall building is easy but making the mall profitable is something i cant figure out
2,The author has forgotten something critical.,"The beginning and the middle of this book were very good, but in the end this author forgets that the President has the power to pardon himself for anything he may have done before he leaves office. Therefore the President will always get away with murder. The author is apparently oblivious to this fact.This is why President Ford could pardon President Nixon even though Nixon hadn't been convicted of anything. Nixon could have pardoned himself. Presidential pardon powers are completely unrestricted. I hope the movie addresses this fact.A much better ending would be if the Secret Service agent would kill the President to make him pay for his crime."
4,Absolute Power is a good read.,"A good read. Good plot line and interesting characters. Baldacci writes good ""vacation"" books. Not great literature but fun to read."
3,It's okay!,I chose a 3 star rating because I expected more from David Baldacci. I was disappointed with the story. It was a slow moving predictable story. I was hoping for more intrigue.
5,great read,"Kept me on the edge of my seat, I found it hard to put down. The characters were real and believable."
4,"""If I told you who did it you wouldn't believe it.""","""If I told you who did it you wouldn't believe it."" The book was a definite page turner for me. At about 30% in, I wanted to find out how it was going to end. There were a few twists and turns along the way, but the outcome was inevitable. This was the second Baldacci book I had read. I am a big fan of James Patterson and I must say that this book was better than any Patterson book I have read in a long time. I would love to see this made into a movie...it would definitely be a hit. This book has everything you need. Action, drama, multiple murders, a touch of romance, and a bit of rough sex. What else could you ask for? I would recommend this to anyone who likes controversy and crime. (PS After writing this review I found out that there is a movie, going to check it out)"
5,A Sadistic President Kills A Young Girl,"I read this book a long time ago but just realized that I've never gave it a review. It's about a sadistic US president who kills a young happy-go-lucky young woman with whom he used to have a secret liaison at her place.He accidentally killed the girl during rough sex, and then his secret service guys cleaned up all the evidence and tried to cover everything up.The only problem was that there was a secret witness to the whole thing: a burglar hiding in the bedroom closet in which the murder took place.The story feels like something that really happened, and that's the most scary part. It is fraught with intimidation and betrayals which eventually caused some suicides.I don't remember what eventually happened to this rogue president in the end, but I do remember that this story kept me on the edge of my seat for days, and I couldn't wait to see what was going to transpire next."
3,Good Summer Reading,"This is a sharp, entertaining read for someone looking for an escape on a vacation. It is smarter than the average thriller, but not so smart that it becomes tedious. It may one of Baldacci's best works."
5,A new favorite,"I recently stumbled across Baldacci. As a fan of Grisham, I am glad that there are other reading options available."
4,Good Murder Story!,I liked Absolute Power better than Total Control. This book kept me interested right until the end. Who could hate Luther-the career criminal with the good heart. Kate and Jacks relationship was boring. She kept saying goodbye and never facing up to her past. It took Kate way too long to figure things out. Burton had all the guilt and could not deal with it. I would recommend this book to all my friends.
4,Better than I thought!,"My sister-in-law lent me this book and said I should read it! I usually like ""classic"" literature so I really wasn't looking forward to this book, but I ended up liking it a lot.I think Baldacci is a good writer, especially his characterizations. You see many sides of all the characters, even the ""bad guys."" You see things from their point of view; they didn't seem like stereotypes to me.I look forward to reading more of Baldacci's books."
4,"Excellent read, but anticlimactic","This book has everything to be called an excellent thriller. But I thought that the ending could have been better conceived. Somehow, the author seems to really hurry towards the climax. A suicidal Secret Service agent seems a bit farfetched."
3,"Fun read, but a few problems","I enjoyed reading this book, but it had a few problems. It was written in 1996, and it is surprising how quickly it has become dated with the lack of cell phones, Polaroid cameras, smoking in restaurants, and such. The portrayal of how the White House works feels a bit unrealistic in places. There are also a few plot holes that any editor should have caught. It seems that everyone is addicted to smoking, but not nearly as much as they are addicted to swearing. When Baldacci wants to convey that someone is feeling a strong emotion, that's done by tossing in the F-word throughout the dialog. I think that word is probably on every page.Despite the shortcomings, it is a solid story that kept me reading to the end."
2,"Decent plot, but the adjectives are mind boggling","I have the Audible edition and while I like this book for its plot. I think the adjectives and details are entirely unbelievable. I don't have any specific examples, but this is the second time I've thought this about a Baldacci novel."
4,Thrilling,"This was the first David Baldacci book I ever read. I was not disappointed. The storyline is overall interesting and enjoyable, and well-paced. You don't get the whole story at first - just a thief witnessing a murder - but as more characters get involved, it becomes a rather good story, and one I ended up enjoying. That's a pretty good start for anyone new to this author."
2,Mediocre at best.,"I read this book because I was desperately in need of something to entertain me for a rather long flight, and it was the only thing I could find on a shelf at a train station other than a few romances that I wouldn't come near with a ten-foot pole.Anyway. On to the review -It was tediously farfetched. Nevertheless, that could have been forgiven - it is fiction, after all - save for the fact that Baldacci simply cannot write. His prose is choppy, juvenile, and ineloquent (uneloquent?). While the plot was okay, the writing, simply put, was not. It was painful to read at times. Although mildly intriguing, this was poorly written and overall somewhat cringeworthy.That said, it served its purpose, and was better than nothing for the flight. It was a tolerable read for the most part.Baldacci's a decent storyteller, but a sucky writer."
1,Absolute Junk,"I give this book a ""2"" because I actually finished the book - I kept waiting for it to turn into the thriller everyone had been raving about. It was a page-turner alright - I kept reading because I couldn't believe that such a paint-by-numbers, ready-to-sell-to-Hollywood piece of junk was getting people so worked up! The characters, for a lack of a better word, were beyond bland. Baldacci's idea of characterization is to describe how ""beautiful"" a woman is or how devastatingly handsome the hero is. This book should have been titled ""Absolute Shallowness""."
1,OH PLEASE,"I just finished listening to as much of the book on CD as I could stomach. The minutia and lack of knowledge of police terminology and tactics was nauseating. The words forhead, perp, peruse, crim, and finger were repeated over and over and over. What might have been a good story in half the words was ruined by descriptions of everyone's clothing, spouses, children, and thinking."
1,You've got to be kidding me,"1. Great story...It's like The Simple Truth, but worse2. The way was written could've been alot better3. I found my self skipping whole chapters sometimes becuase it had nothing to with the story, just political stuff4. Seemed to drag on...believe, it's his worst book yet. Try The Simple Truth or Split Second....It's worth it."
2,Absolute Junk,"Luther an excon wants to pull one last heist. While secluded inside of a vault behind a one way mirror he witnesses the President of the USA murder someone.I'm sure many of you saw the movie with Clint Eastwood as Luther and let me tell you, the book is no better then the movie. I listened to this book and couldn't believe it. I almost couldn't stay with it to the end.It is so far fetched and like most book/movie combinations they don't go hand in hand.I will say that it is better then the movie.Folks, all I can say is don't waste your time on this one."
1,"Very suspenseful in parts, but otherwise boring & silly","The novel starts well--five stars. It follows with lots of padding--pretentious stuff not relevant to the thriller stuff such as lots of erotic stuff and padding, padding, padding. It loses one star per 100 pages. The final portion becomes a page turner but with still occasional padding. End result: one star out of five.Examples of the nonsense: The chief of staff of the White House (a woman) rapes the unconscious President of the United States! A lieutant of the state police of Virginia forces his way into the White House during a cabinet meeting to deliver court documents. The President of the USA sentenced to death (no mention of impeachment) while his chief of staff, who is even guiltier (but is a woman) gets off with community work. The book is full of such silliness."
5,I have a pair,I havent read this book yet but from the other reviews i have seen that it is a good book. I have read a few pages and it has keep me on the end of my seat. I'm sure i'll have a great time reading it ms. B. This will be better than doing a community service project.
3,Too many characters,"While I haven't finished the book yet, I am finding there are so many characters that I get lost if I put the book down for a couple of days and don't remember who's who."
5,Absolutely Worth Reading,"Baldacci's first novel may be an oldie, but it's most definitely a goodie. A fast-paced, don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-it thriller, ""Absolute Power"" explores the idea of the nation's chief executive as a conscienceless murderer.The smarmy President in this novel seems like a composite of everybody's worst nightmare (depending on what your party affiliation is, take your pick!) -- highly popular with press and constituents, well on his way to re-election, king of the sound bites--and a low-life philanderer who's not above a little violence. The ""ew"" factor is very high--and his chances of ever getting caught are very low.Add in a young up-and-coming lawyer with a consience, a female chief-of-staff who has more than a few things to hide (including her unrequited adoration of her boss), a lifetime criminal with a heart of gold, and two loyal Secret Service agents in over their heads--and you've got a whopper of a yarn. I loved it."
5,one of Baldacci's two best,"Along with Baldacci's ""The Winner,"" this book ranks in the top 10 of all books of this genre in my view. While the movie was well acted and well written, for those of us who read the book first, the storyline couldn't compare to the incredible depth, character development and subplots of the book. Treat yourself to a page-turner you won't be able to put down."
3,ABSOLUTELY ENTERTAINING,"Baldacci's first novel is an entertaining story, but could use a good editor. It's hard-boiled suspense results in a real page turner. Good character development (something Clint Eastwood's film version is lacking) adds to the sometimes rambling story. A good first effort and a good read."
5,Absolute Power,"Similar to previous Baldacci books this story drew you in from the first page. The intricate weave of the characters and plot kept the reader enthralled until the final page. There were times, well passed midnight, when I found it very difficult to put this book down."
5,Absolute Power,"A friend recommended this author. Good call. I'm going to read them all now, making sure to read them in order!"
3,Absolute Power,The plot and characters of this novel were very interesting. But the event that triggered the denouement was really not believable. I still don't understand what triggered the final event. Perhaps the editor had to be talked into this before the novel was printed.
2,"May be talented, but the writing needs to be improved","Lots of boring repeatitions in this books. Lot of pages you have to leap frogged through. The plots sometimes twisted very unnaturally and pretentiously. But this writer is somewhat talented due to his legal experience, but definitely not great as J. Grisham. Don't be fooled by your lucky success this time, your fame might be obscured if you fail to improve your writing logic. And most important of all, don't pick J.G. as your role model. If the screenplay had to make a lot of changes, it only means there were two many flaws in the original book, and the movie itself still turned out to be very bad"
2,Junk food and empty calories for the brain.,"Following the ""bestseller"" formula, there are a lot of twists and turns in this story. But that is all. There is no interesting character. Furthermore, there is no discernable motivation - what motivates these characters to act the way they did, other than to add another twist to the author's story? Ask yourself, is it believable to you, given the charactization (I am using that word loosely) of the billionaire, that he will do what he did to the president"
5,EXCELLENT READ FROM START TO FINISH. COULD NOT QUIT,FIRST TIME I READ BALDACCI BUT RAN TO THE STORE TO GET HIS NEXT AND AM ANXIOUSLY AWAITING HIS THIRD. BETTER THAN MOST OF LUDLUM'S. MOVIE WAS ALMOST AS GOOD BUT DEVIATED FROM BOOK TOO MUCH. EASTWOOD WAS EXCELLENT AS LUTHER WHITNEY
1,Fast food for inattentive readers.,"Though Luther Whitney is an engaging hero, he seems lifted from the frames of ""To Catch a Thief"" and dropped behind an improbable two-way mirror to witness the most contrived murder the history of national politics. Mr. Baldacci has left nothing to chance, spinning into the plot-driven cuisineart an abusive President, a career driven Chief of Staff, untrustworthy Secret Service agents, an aging cat burglar and his estranged daughter who's ex-boyfriend lawyer is -- wouldn't you know it -- a cracker jack corporate attorney who hankers to return to the meaningful criminal defense work he misses. Whew! Did I miss anything? This script -- I mean novel -- is more of a palimpsest than a full blown story. The kind of ""runaway besteller"" that is most kindly be described as a fast read"
3,"Pretty Solid, certainly worth a read","Some tight plotting and strong action later in the novel. First third seemed to drag a bit. I really enjoyed Frank and Burton as characters, as well as Whitney. Jack was a decent lead, though Kate didn't do much for me. The constant cigarette smoking and various people trying to quit did annoy me, and it seems clear that Baldacci might have been fighting the fight to quit while writing."
4,Good read.,"Entertaining, believable fiction. Has a reasonable pace and is not too detailed when describing places and characters. I would recommend this book to a friend or family member."
3,I like a Baldacci book,"The book had me entertained. I had saw the movie some time ago, but found the book to be more in-depth, as most books are. Not my favorite of Mr. Baldaccis, but a thriller none the less. Luther, the star early on, passes the torch to Jack and Det. Frank. The events towards the end made up for the few lulls in the middle. Strong characters, Sullivans, Baldwins, the law firm make for an overall good read. The corruption at the top of the governmental scale was very evident and interesting. As I say I enjoyed it, and look forward to ""Wish you well"" by Mr. Baldacci."
4,Bridget's Review,"A thief, Luther, got more than he bargained for when he visited a mansion in Virginia thinking he could make it out of there with a few prize pieces. He becomes trapped in the wall when two people being having an intimate moment. The shocking part is the murder that takes place and it has to do with the US president.Jack is an attorney and he is determined to find out what really happened that night. Who is telling the truth, a burglar or the man entrusted with the most powerful job in America?Political thrillers have a way of wrapping themselves around my brain and not letting go until I have finished the whole story. David's work is no exception. He has a way of taking you from point A to point Z and keeping the suspense at just the right level."
4,Absolutely Thrilling,"I saw the movie when it first came out a couple of years ago, and this month I picked up the book and began to read it. They both start out very similar, but end in two totally different ways. I like the movie's ending much better than I did the book's.Both begin with Luther Whitney, burglar extraordinaire, witnessing a brutal murder. Now it's up to Whitney to save his own hide, and expose the bad guys at the same time. Question is will he expose them, and therefore turn himself in as well, or will he let them go, and get out of the country as fast as he can?I liked the book because it dealt with corruption and cover-ups at top levels, and how low people will go in order to hide the truth. I liked it so much that I went out and bought Baldacci's next book 'Total Control'."
4,"fast paced, full of surprises, reminescent of the firm","exciting and hard to put down. the book opens with a bang and never let's up. balducci's writing is clear, easy to follow and riviting at the same time. just how far will you go to follow your bosses orders, even if he is the most powerful man on earth? a very impressive debut novel"
5,Murder and the President--unbelievable?,"A completely different look at the power behind the White House. The author shows you the ""behind the scenes"" drama of the Oval Office you never dreamed of before. The Secret Service will never be the same in anyone's mind. A real page-turning, midnight oil-burning book"
2,poorly written,"This book makes Grisham look like he deserves a Pulitzer. The story kept me reading (I did finish the book) but it was not particularly credible. However, the writing was truly awful and the dialogue stilted and trite. There's lots of better stuff to read out there."
3,Hard-Boiled Suspense,"Baldaccis' debut novel is an entertaining read and an ambitious first effort. Corruption in the White House is no longer a startling subject, so no leap of faith is required by the reader to accept such a concept. Good character development and slick plot twists make this a real page-turner (skip the movie version)."
3,Was a good book to pass away a few days,"I had not read him before and luckly did not see the movie first. (i was disappointed in the movie but still like clint.) it did seem a bit ""story book"" and predictable but enjoyed the few twists in the plot."
4,Interesting,"I thought that this book was filled with many details that sounded plausible. The plot, however, was a bit hard to believe until I read about the Clinton scandal. Still, it got a bit boring after a while, but picks up a bit near the end. It was good for a first book though, I suppose, and it was good enough to be made into a movie with a major star."
3,Absolute Power,"An entertaining read let down by ham-fisted characterisations and some contrived plot progressions.As a debut though, it is a satisfactory novel and having not read any of Baldacci's work before I expect he is going to be on an upward curve providing he addresses these issues."
5,Absolute Power by David Baldacci,"Mr. Baldacci has a gift when it comes to story telling. In the very beginning of the novel, he creates a situation of excitement and mystery which captivates and holds the reader's attention throughout the book. It is difficult to put the book down since you want to read until the last sentence is consumed. A great read!"
2,A bit painful to get through,"I read ""The Innocent"" by the same author and really enjoyed it so I had high hopes for this novel. Unfortunately I was disappointed. Without giving too much away I found myself skimming pages just trying to get to the end and seriously considering giving up on the book all together. I think the main issue is so much time is spent on the villans in the story you begin to genuinely dislike them and I found myself frustrated with having to hear about these characters who were so despicable. I will say it's an easy read and given it is a mystery and there are a few twists and turns (so many that it was a bit cliche) so maybe that will be entertaining for some readers but overall I found it annoying and frustrating."
2,Disappointed,I ordered this item on April 30 and there is no indication what so ever as to when I will get this item along with the rest of the collection I purchased. So far all I have received is the bumper for the crib. It is an adorable set but I am really disappointed that my baby will most likely be here before I receive any other items for this collection! Target should really indicate that items are on back order when they are and not indicate that items will ship within 1-2 days. Very disappointing and not high on the customer-friendly service I am so used to with them.
4,1stTimeMom,"I really like this comfortor - the quality of the quilting is excellent, and the patches are sewn and not just printed on. The colors are wonderful and easy to match with other items. The material is soft and easy to wash."
5,Great Quality for a Great Price,"So far I have the comforter, crib sheet, bumper, and dust ruffle. They are all of excellent quality and would look great for a boy or a girl room. I too have looked on Ebay for the pieces that are not offered by Target, some of them are outrageously priced. If anyone knows where else to look for these items, it would be much appreciated. Thanks."
4,GOOD FILM,"Quite a good film from the 1954, as pirate films go.Though if your expecting COLOR ,well this print is Black & White onlyand 4.3.Despite Amazon's and on the slick,its not WideScreen.The 4.3 ratio is correct, but it should be in Color,it even says Color in the credits.and on the DVD Slick.Being a Projectionist by trade,I ran this in the 50's in a SuperCinecolor print.Though I must say MGM have provided a nice sharp Black & White transfer.Just don't expect Color.Not worth $19.99 though."
5,Great Read,"Inspired me to start the first Hispanic all Spanish newspaper in central Alabama. We broke even on the 3rd edition and showed a $1,200 profit on the 4th. Success ever since. Thanks for the inspiration and insightful tips, they worked."
3,My opinion...,I found this book informative and several of the plans/ideas are actually feasable to someone in my situation. I was looking for more information pertaining to the newsletter/newspaper aspect but will keep it as a reference anyway.
4,Publish Your Own Magazine,"Recently, I ordered this book and I must say, I really am proud of the service I receive and the timeliness of its arrival. This book is very detail and written in a manner even a novice can understand. I really appreciate the service of amazon and to this author and shipper, keep it up!!As a new publisher www.youthconnex.com I was able to get the inside secret in a friendly manner and yet professional tone."
5,Motivational,"I've wanted to start an original content development project for years. Reading this books gets my wheels spinning. If I do move forward with my idea, this book will be by my side. I run a small business training program and I would definitely recommend this book to any client who had an interest in publishing.I'd love to sit down with Dr. Williams and pick his brain. There are questions I'd like answered beyond the book, but this makes the whole idea of starting a local project seem possible."
2,Misleading at best and in dire need of a new titled,"This should be titled, How to Make Money Producing Free Junk Magazines. Most of the folks I know in the publishing industry would love to see a down to basics intro to publishing, ie, the printing lingo, developing relationships with authors, editing tips, detailed layout advice, etc. This book is about producing, not publishing. Moving units of advertising, not creating something worthwhile to read or engage the public. This is a get-rich-quick book that belongs in the business section and has not place near publishing/literature reference."
3,You get whoever you end up with,"""Boys on the Side"" really isn't the hip chick flick road trip film I'd expected. It's a lot more.The story originates with Jane (Goldberg) and Robin (Parker) joining forces to make a cross-country road trip from New York to California. They have nothing in common--Robin is totally white bread and likes the Carpenters. Whoopi sings Janis Joplin in a nightclub.They stop to visit Holly (Barrymore), a friend of Jane's in Pittsburgh and find her in serious straits with her druggie boyfriend, Nick. Holly ends up coming along with them--though she regrets leaving Nick.All three of the women have secrets and the unveiling of these secrets and consequential acceptance-rejection of them is what makes the film different. One particular favorite aspect of this film is the soundtrack featuring songs from many popular female artists."
4,Another great Drew movie,"Another great Drew Barrymore movie. Another great cross-country road trip movie. Whoppi Goldberg stars as a lesbian lounge singer in search of a new life; Drew Barrymore stars as a pregnant girl who accidentally killed her abusive boyfriend; and Mary Louise Parker stars as an uptight real estate agent who is infected with HIV. The three women hide out in a small town in Arizona, hoping to start a new life. The relationship between Goldberg's character and Parker's character is very touching. A great chick flick."
2,I didn't care for this movie.,This movie really had no point to me. I watched it almost until the end and I just had to turn it off! I saw no point to it. I was looking for movies that I hadn't seen before and came across this one. I didn't find it entertaining enough to finish.
4,Nice & Quick,"got my package days after purchasing, nice & quick. Disc and package in decent condition"
3,"Well,,,,",This is a good movie to watch with your girlfriends. It tells of a trio of friends who come from completely different backgrounds who struggle and stick together. Very touching story.
4,An entertaining ride,"A road movie for the fairer sex, ""Boys on the Side"" is helped immeasurably by the performances of Mary-Louise Parker, Drew Barrymore, and Whoopi Goldberg. The latter plays a lesbian nightclub singer (!) who agrees to share the wheel with repressed, straight-laced Parker on a trip to San Diego. Following a serious misadventure with her drug pusher boyfriend, the still pixy-ish Barrymore joins the journey.""Boys on the Side"" is as contrived as a soap opera with each character facing a personal crisis, but the three stars are so good, it's easy to overlook the frequently smarmy plot developments and enjoy the performances. Parker is particularly good, especially when she unwinds by lip-synching to Elvis Presley's ""Jailhouse Rock."" The soundtrack is nicely compiled, too, and features performances by the likes of Sarah McLachlan, Bonnie Raitt, The Indigo Girls, and Annie Lennox.Brian W. Fairbanks"
4,Real Life - Real People,"The best thing about this movie is that it ""feels"" real - Like it did or could reall happen to me or you. The fact that the caracters are lesbian is secondary to the story and the great acting performances. The actors are top rate, the setting was classic and interesting without being distracting. The movie is funny and entertaining while trying to get a serious message across without hitting you over the head. Yes that message is ""you can love"" even if you have AIDS and others can love you back."
3,Boys on the Side review,"This movie will appeal to a wide range of people. The central characters are engaging, funny & smart! The themes are probably quite confrontational for when the movie was made and may still be challenging for some people, today! The three women in the story highlight the simplicity and complexity of friendship but also illustrate the importance of trust and respect in any relationship. You will laugh, you may cry but I do recommend this film to viewers who like to watch a thoroughly enjoyable movie, with a little naughtiness 'on the side"""
1,Broke on first use,"This luggage is not well designed since the left latch broke upon first use. Anyone who purchases this piece should also buy a luggage strap to make it secure, since the flimsy latches will not hold up. If they open, which they do easily, even when you don't want them to, they will be broken off if they come in contact with other luggage. I have requested a repair or replacement from EBags and will follow up this COMMENT if I do not receive satisfaction. Samsonite needs to redesign this luggage."
4,Supposly it's a really good book to read for public speaking.,I bought the book for an honors public speaking class but never ended up having to use it! LOL! I never read the book but my classmates who did read the book said it was a GREAT book! They all recommended me to read it over the summer break. LOL. I might have time later...
1,Not worth [it],"This is one of the biggest pieces of junk I've ever seen. I bought this for my son for Christmas, and he can't even use it because it falls apart any time you open it. I'm very disappointed in it because it looked perfect: places inside to hold the markers individually and boxes of crayons, etc. But in reality it's only good as a carrying case, not a lap desk, and then only if you don't mind putting it back together constantly. I found one from Crayola that doesn't look as fancy, but it a much better deal."
2,Piece of junk,"Don't waste your money on this sad thing. It broke the first day so I couldn't even put it back together, I just threw it in the trash."
2,"Clearly not a ""Kid's Review""","It is pretty darn obvious that the review below that is supposedly from a child (""Kid's Review"") is not written by a child. Give me a break. I give kids a lot of credit, but how can one be that articulate? Obviously it is from someone who had a hand in designing or selling this product and is trying to promote it. It's chintzy! Get over it!"
1,Not worth the effort.,"Couldn't get past the first chapter. Nothing about the writing, story, or hero and heroine made me want to continue."
4,A good presentation of seashells found in Puerto rico,"This book is the best book and perhaps the only book that gives special emphasis to seashells found in Puerto Rico. Scientific as well as popular listing of the shells is included. The textual description of the shells is quite adequate. Also, a general location of where the shells can be found is frequently included. On a less positive note, most all the pictures are in black and white and often the resolution leaves something to be desired. In all fairness, the book is in need of an update being last published in 1975. Since its last publication, several new shells previously unlisted or listed as ""not found"" have indeed been located. In spite of these few short comings, this book is still an invaluable resource for anyone interested in Puerto Rican seashells."
5,Remember the popper toy?,"Do you remember the popper toy that we all loved as kids and that drove our parents crazy. This has the same effect with a much more loveable sound. My daughter can play with it for hours (which she does) and never drive me crazy. The toy is light weight, durable, easy to take to grandma's house and hours of fun for your child. I would recommend this toy to anyone with an active toddler who enjoys toys that make sounds."
3,"YOU WILL NOT GET THE PICTURED TOY, NO DECAL ON IT","I have ordered this toy twice now. The first one came from a independent seller who sells through Amazon. It was filthy dirty and covered with dust. Plus it did not have the front decal down the handle. Amazon said to send it back and sent me a label to mail it. I order another one from Amazon at $3 more and it comes clean but still no decal. Buy one at Walmart and you get the decal down the handle. If they have the decal in the picture, then I feel they should send the one with a decal or explain that they changed the styling. It looks so much better with the decal, this one is very plain. Not happy with Amazon at all."
1,Breaks easily,"I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas thinking it would be easier on the ears than the popper. Haha. Its cute and she liked it but after playing with it maybe two days, the chime stopped working. It only worked some here and there. Her daycare has them as well and when I asked them how theirs are working, I was told they don't work all the time either. Instead of exchangin mine, I just returned for a refiund. It wasn't worth it to ""see if the next one will work""."
4,Cute little chime toy,"not sure how educational the toy is, but i can tell you the chime sounds nice - not too loud.Great for my 14 month old to push around and smile :)"
5,Pleasant volume!,"It would seem they've adapted the chimes inside to a softer volume, which for us is preferred, while not losing the fun."
2,1 yr old can't figure it out,11 mos old received as Christmas present. Now at almost 14 mos she still can't figure it out and gets frustrated when it falls out of her hands or she pushes it over too far. It came with a dent in the metal chime cylinder (we have a different pattern). I plan on adding it to the garage sale pile.
3,came dented.,"my 14 month old loves this. The jingle isn't annoying like a popcorn popper push toy would be. if you don't mind that it easily dents, it's great!!"
4,Its okay,The product was well made and quite easy to remove from the package which is very important. I only gave it four stars because the music is very very quiet it could be i'm deaf but i'm pretty sure its not. My son lost interest quickly but that i think that can be a sign of the digital age what kid would want to play with this when they have access to touch screen devices that play music and have pretty color and lights.
4,"Good Toy, not as good as the classic","I got this toy to replace my old one that my son recently broken (mine was from around 30 years ago). This version is just as fun for him, but I do have a small quibble: the sound that the plastic wheel makes is almost as loud as the music from the box. The original I had the sound was the main thing you heard, but this one the sound of it rolling almost drowns out the music. My son doesn't mind, but I do, so I'm giving this 4 stars."
1,BAD SELLER Toy arrived dirty and looked used.,This toy showed up DIRTY and looked used. I ordered it as a gift for my granddaughter for Easter.It costs as much to send it back as it did to buy it so I'm just screwed there. I will NOT use this seller again.
5,Melodious Fun,"We have the fisher price popper toy & this melody chime toy. Both are played with a lot by my step-grandsons (ages 1-1/2 & 2-1/2). We all prefer this toy since its melodious chime is not nearly as loud & intrusive as the popper. I remember loving this toy as a child. Now it's completely plastic but still durable. Sounds the same as the original vintage toy. Safe on carpets, rugs & wood floors."
1,Not everyone's cup of tea. A difficult movie to appreciate and view,I watched this movie and found it not one of Jessica Tandy's best movies. I am surprised she won an award for it as it had a plot that was not easy to follow. The plot drags and does not make for enjoyable viewing. Not my favourite and would never be one I would recommend people to view. A rare sight to see John Denver acting. Pity the movie was not up to his great singing talent.
5,Great Movie!,"I wanted to see this movie again, since I believe originally it was a made for tv movie at first. Glad i found this movie available. Thanks for the fast shipping, and excellent service!"
3,A Fabulous Duo,"The fabulous duo is Jessica Tandy whose husband passed away but is still around as a ghost. Her dead husband is played by her real-life husband, Hume Cronyn. Both actors have passed away but their work is alive in many movies, including Foxfire. The basic plot is simple. Their son, played by the late, great singer John Denver, wants to convince his mother her best move is to leave her mountain home and live with him in Florida. During the movie we see flashbacks showing problems between father and son, but also a deep love for family and the mountains. Wonderful scenerey, the widow's refusal to leave the only home she's known and her husband's ghost, old-time ethics, and the running dialoge between the woman and her husband's ghost. I gave it three stars because of a bit too much ""aw-shawks"" to suit me, and songs not likely to be sung in a real Denver concert, but definitely worth watching this Hallmark Hall of Fame movie just for the pairing of Tandy and Cronyn."
2,OK but......,"As everyone else said, this looses a lot in the translation, which this company has done to pretty much all the animes it get. The voices are bad (I mean come on! Joey lives in Japan, but sounds like he's from Brooklin) Get this if you like the Kid's WB version but I suggest you get an import from the Japaneese to get the real effect. Another reason to get the Jap is because they have a season before this that never was, and to our dismay probly never will be, released in America"
1,STAY AWAY.,"Okay, let's take a look at the pros and cons of this box set:Pros:* Contains 49 episodes over 16 DVDs.Cons:* Far from Uncut.* Only includes the Edited English version as seen on Kids' WB!* The voices... well, to be blunt, SUCK.* The translation... if you can even call it a ""translation""... is completely off and doesn't capture any spirit of the original Japanese version.* The music is synthesized bullcrap equivalent to toddler's xialaphones (however it's spelled).* Nearly every frame is censored, due to the original cards having... OMG teh japanees wryting!!!4Kids took this show and completely blowed it out of proportion. If you like Yugioh, or even the dub, don't buy this set. You're much better off buying the R2 sets [...] or taping the episodes off of Kids' WB!, Cartoon Network, YTV, etc.Don't support these DVDs until 4Kids gets the gall to release an Uncut version."
3,i have the books,"hello all i have the yugioh books graphic novels im 11 and all you people that said this book is not for kids tough luck they did say bad words nasty things but mostly its funny i like how they made the spirit of the puzzle violent heh heh anyways the names for yugi tristian joey tea are katsuya jonouchi which is joey hiroto honda tristian anzu mazaki tea suoroku motou which is mr motuo yugi, kaiba, and mokuba are the same. i read that some reviews if a kid reads this novel i will never like ygo again HAHA u ppl must be old ppl if you said that U DONT HAVE TO WAIT INTO YOUR 18 TO READ THIS i like this better then the shows and ppl who said that hahaha i probaly are 70 year olds acting like your 16 that like yugioh HAHA hope this review helps all of you interested with yugioh i think that 10 and older read this younger no way"
5,the best anime ever,"the first season isn't my favourite season but i still love it, yu gi oh is by far the best anime tv show i've ever seen and i really don't know how people can say it's bad. the first season has awesome anime, a pretty good story line and, like every other season it is really easy to get hooked on. i'm a massive yu gi oh fan and i think that even season one is some of the best anime i've ever seen. i highly recomend this to anyone who enjoys good anime."
3,OK SEASON,THE SEASON HAS ALOT OF EPISODES 49 TO BE EXACT. THE PICTURE WAS OK. SOMEOF THE EPISODES WERE BORING. THE SEASON IS SEASON 1 OF THE SECOND YUGIOHSERIES. I LOVED EPISODE 1 THE MOST BECAUSE IT WAS INTRODUCING THE MAINCHARACTERS.THE SEACOND REASON WAS THAT YUGI AND KIABA MEAT AND DEAULEDEACH OTHER. THE GOOD THING WAS THAT YUGI WON.PS. YOU SHOULD GET IT IF YOU WANT TO.
3,"More Cons Than Pros, But SOME Pros.","Yu-gi-oh Season 1 is very good for a number of reasons, including shorter duels, many villains and a very odd antagonist.Unfortunately, the season's duels include more cons, than pros. There is a long list of cheating in this season, including no tributes, no damage, playing against card effects and using card effects wrong. Some of these cheats are used in Battle City arc. and the Orichalcos arc., but season 1 includes the most, 'bending of rules'.This season, however, has shorter duels than seasons 2-5 due to less side talking. This is a good thing, because you can see more plays, and a bad thing because the whole tournament is over in 36 episodes. The Battle City Tournament was on for 75 episodes (see my review for Yu-gi-oh Season 2).So Season 1 has pros and cons, but it gets a three out of five because there are many things in this series that may anger some deep fans of Yu-gi-oh."
1,Your all being fooled,"The first season that was aired in America was not the beginning of Yugioh. It was actually the second season, but because the licencing companies thought the first season was too violent and graphic they decided to make it look like season 2 was in fact season 1. In the first season Yugi becomes completly possessed by the spirit and exacts violent and painful vengence on people for thier crimes against humanity. I suppose they decided that this was not best suited for the younger audience the dub was clearly geared towards."
1,Not Uncut,"It isn't worth it if it's editted. Seariously, get uncut. Even if you need Japanese with English subtitles, get it. The edited version is the worst piece of animated trash I have ever seen, and blame it all on the cruddy job done by 4kids."
3,Bad Voice Tristin,"Tristin is a cool character, because of the love interest story they made in season 2, but in season one, Tristin had a real bad voice actor. The clothes in the 1st season are bad as well. But overall, Yu-Gi-Oh is hands down a better show then Pokemon. Yu-Gi-Oh, is more serious then silly comedy. Unlike the tired old, team rocket in Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh is a show I can enjoy, even though I was spectacle about watching another anime show, especially one done by 4Kids. Season one plot for the show is great, for Yugi is dueling battles to save his grandfather, even though I never did see all the episodes of the season one, i guess this is my chance. Season 2 DVD will be even better, for it deals with the 3 Egyptian God cards, and the end of the 3rd season, for it will also deal with the God cards and Marik."
2,really?,"I didnt buy this but i liked the show as a kid, however be smarter with your money people it costs way too much, if you buy them individually it dosnt even cost half than it would with this set. I hope they get smart and lower the price soon."
2,Caedmon's Call's Worst Album to date,"This is easily Caedmon's Call's worst album to date.Worship music has become the ""in"" thing these days. I wish Caedmon's Call didn't try to hop on the worship bandwagon. They should have stuck to what made their last few albums so great(Long Line of Leavers, 40 Acres, self-titled)--deep, honest, heartfelt songs about the things in life that Christians really struggle with (not just all the spiritual mumbo jumbo, but stuff like issues with dating and friendship; things that even people who aren't Christians can connect with).I'm looking forward to Caedmon's Call's next *real* CD."
5,they've done it again,"wow, this cd is awesome. i really really really really hope they will come to the east coast for a performance of this album. they've been so amazing at past concerts. even when their cds are excellent, their concerts blow you away. nevertheless, put on really good headphones and soak it up."
5,Awesome Worship,"I had one of these songs on here, Praise the God Who Saves, sung at Easter time last year its an awesome song and also Thy Mercy was sung as well."
3,Disappointing,"I love Caedmon's Call, but this CD doesn't cut it. Unlike previous efforts from Caedmon's Call, this CD comes off very popish, which is probably why it is getting so much radio play. There is not much on this CD that is new or inspiring. The fact that they chose to record yet another version of ""God of Wonders"" for this release makes me believe that they are simply running out of things to record.With that being said, the one exception is the song ""Thy Mercy"" which I found to be a good diversion from the dryness of this CD and a return to previous efforts from the band. I hope future efforts can return to the styles of 40 Acres and Intimate Protrait."
4,Awesome CD,"This is an awesome cd it may not seem that way at first but just listen closly to the lyrics and let the grace of the music flow. Third Day, Sonicflood, and Passion along with Caedmon's Call are the best christian groups I have found so get them and enjoy!"
4,Encouraging and rich worship,"Although not every song on this album has gripped my heart and kept it, the songs that have are incredibly effective and beautiful. I especially like the two songs sung each by Derek Webb and Danielle Young, (I was a little disapointed that there wasn't more of them) and also the songs written by Josh Moore. Sandra McCracken has written some unusually beautiful melodies. I definitely recommend this album."
4,A call to Worship: Pleasing album,"Caedmon's Group is a christian pop group of several people who have come together because they share a joint love and passion of God and his son Jesus. It is pleasing to see a band like this in today's contemporary world where alot of negativity is around and not alot of positivity. Lyrically, the songs are laden with messages of professed faith and hope, they blend this with easy listening pop tunes that any church choir could sing too. I also see many of Caedmon's Call becoming mainstays in Churches across the world."
4,Great new songs & revised classic hymns,"""In the Company of Angels"" is a great CD. These songs blend pop, traditional hymns andacoustic folk rock to develop a freshsound for worship. Pick it up."
2,the pole of the handel too long does not work properly,usng it but not operating properly i realy expected better have to keep top of toilet bowl to operate oh well
4,"If This is Nowhere, I Want In","#2,5,10 & 11 are my favorites. Read a tintsy review in Men's Health Best Life and just took a chance. A chance well rewarded with so many listens it borders on downright silly. Like your favorite item of clothing, you'll want to throw this on for just about any occasion."
1,Poorly Made Crap,"I purchased the Skullcandy Lowrider headphones about four months ago in October 2010. I was very careful with them because of the previous reviews. I figured if I treated them extra gently then maybe they wouldn't break. I was so wrong and I am so irritated at myself for not listening to what other people were saying. Last month (Jan 2011), the ear piece on the right side snapped. However, they were still usable. I just couldn't adjust them. Then today (Feb 28, 2011) the top band broke in the middle rendering them absolutely useless unless I find some duct tape and rig it up. Pay attention to the reviews people and save your money. These headphones are absolute crap. Also the sound quality is poor especially if you like bass."
4,Nice Headphones,These headphones are great if your looking for something cute or stylish with without the bulk of the big headphones. Sound quality is excellent.
2,Broke,"I bought these for my daughter for Christmas! Within 7 days they broke! She wasn't rough with them, the plastic must be very cheap with no give. I wish I had read to reviews on this one. $20 down the toilet. Very disapointed!"
5,Love love love these headphones!,I wasn't really expecting them to be as nice as they were.. For the price I paid I kinda expected them to feel cheap and sound dull. These headphones are amazing and super cute!
4,Shawns headphones,"My granddaughter was so excited when she opened them at Christmas, and I don't believe she has had them off since.They came very quickly which I appreciated.Great service, thank you"
3,Skullcandy Headphones,"I was pretty disappointed with these headphones (after being pleased with the first set I bought). After having them for only 2 weeks, my son took them off his head and BOTH plastic adjusters on each side of the headphones snapped. Useless. Fortunately, as I stated, we had another pair so replaced the broken head strap adjusters with those from the first pair. My son is very happy with the sound quality of these headphones, so if they were made more durable, it would make them a good product."
2,"Uncomfortable, broken in a few months","I bought these headphones a few months ago because I love the color and style of them. Unfortunately I noticed soon after wearing them for extended periods of times that they create a lot of pressure on your temple, making them very uncomfortable for people who are sensitive to that sort of thing. I suppose it is fine for children or petite people, but I am average size and I felt like they clamped onto my head much too tightly to be comfortable.Due to very poor construction the plastic part on the left side snapped in half when I went to put them on. I am always fairly gentle with then and haven't banged them around at all. It's much too late to return the product.So I do NOT recommend these at all. They look great, but feel terrible when you actually wear them and break easily."
2,Great Headphones-- 'Til They Broke 2 Months In,"I ordered these on 12/31/09 and on 02/08/10 they snapped when I was putting them on. I only use them at the office and I was not being particularly harsh with them, but they broke at the extender piece. VERY disappointing.Prior to that, they had offered me great sound (by my not-particularly-picky ears) and for the most part comfort, although I occasionally had them fitting a bit too tight after a couple of hours, which was easily fixed by the extender. Which is now broken.Bitter, bitter. This was my first time buying 'nicer' headphones, even if they were on sale. Maybe I should stick to my cheap drugstore headphones."
2,head piece snaped within one week of use,"the sound quality is excellent on this product, but the piece that is plastic on top that holds them together snaped the first week I used them."
5,Great Headphones!,"These are the best pair of headphones i have ever owned! They arrived with plenty of time left over from the shipping estimate and they are amazing to boot! The sound quality is great, they are very stylish, and I just love them completely! I highly recommend these for anyone who loves music!"
4,where's the 6.3mm stereo adaptor?,"The description on these says ""6.3mm stereo adaptor included"" but they weren't included. Can someone tell me if this is a typo or who I need to contact to get this adaptor? This was one of the main selling points for me..."
2,Severely Uncomfortable,"I had been looking at these headphones for a long time. I'm not usually one to go for flashy, let alone pink, but I took a chance and purchased them because of the price. I was planning on using these headphones purely for their functionality in the dorm room and for my MP3 player. I got them just in time for a 4 hour flight and when I slipped them on to ignore some chatty passengers behind me, I could barely keep them on for 20 minutes. They were not comfortable (perhaps because I have a larger head than most). The padding on the top of the head was minimal and quite hard considering the pressure that the arms create by my temples. The cushion on the ears was fine and the sound quality was good, but nothing spectacular. I wouldn't necessarily recommend these headphones who are sensitive to pressure on their head. These headphones made the rest of my flight excruciating."
3,"great sound, great look, crappy material...","I have to say I've wanted these headphones for a while. Voila my partner got them for me for Christmas. The sound was excellent and I'd say on par with his Bose headphones. The look was (obviously) awesome...and then crisis happened. Four days ago (so less than a month after owning them) I was taking them off my head like normal and they band just snapped. It broke in two. I didn't use force (I'm ridiculously gentle with them) nothing like that. My room mate attempted to fix them with krazy glue and apparently krazy glue melts plastic (how cheap are these?!?!) So needless to say... on a superficial level these are excellent, as for sound (bass and what not) they are very good... as for quality they arent up to par. Probably best for the younger crowd who are going to use them occasionally."
2,disappointment,"The headphones looked so cool and functional online but they snapped in half the first week I had them. They are not made for DJ'ing or heavy computer use, I was using them as MP3 headphones and that's when they snapped. Sad times."
3,not too thrilled!,"the thing I really hate about these headphones is that everyone around you can hear everything you are listening to! I don't like to bother people and I had it very low and everyone could hear all the lyrics and everything. I wanted these to listen to in the car and now I can't use them for that. Also the comfort level is not too great! The ear pieces are too small. I do like the sound quality but I really don't feel like I can really use them ever, so it was a big waste of money!"
4,So Far So Good,"I got this as a replacement for my 7 year old daughter. My husband has used them also. They sound great and so far has suffered the ""careful"" use of a typical 7 year old."
1,Boys Playing.,These young men are basically talking and driving through the whole 25 minutes. Thats it. Nothing else.
2,Handles are the weak spot,"This is a nice bag. However the handles are the weak point of this bag. Mine are fraying, and tearing, and have almost come apart. The bag itself is in great shape and I take care of it. The handles are a poor design from the get go. I am currently returning the bad to Targus for repair replacement. I am hoping they stand by their product. Again, I like the bag - but the handles are just not durable."
2,Incredibly Disappointing,"This is not the album to buy. Super Sista is the one. Super Sista was a fantastic album. This album was flat and an incredible disappointment. It has some tracks but net,net it's a flat album that doesn't rise to the occasion."
5,Excellent Product,The C20 scanning pen has far exceeded my expectations - if you are considering one I highly recomend this product.I am currently studying law and the ability to condense lenghty law books into readable notes is essential. The C 20 scanning pen has been of tremendous assistance and saved me a great deal of time.The product was easy to use out of the box and the accuracy rate is astounding. I had been using dragonspeech 10 to try to condense my reading but this product is far faster and much more accurate.The acccuracy is around 95 - 96 % and it is really a very impressive product.If you need to scan text to your P.C. this is the tool. This is my first review - I didn't buy the product on Amazon but the reviews here were key to my purchasing the product so I wanted to help other prospective purchasers who may be researching here.Again great product.
2,Doesn't Work On Vista 64 Bit!!!!!,"I ordered the Ectaco C- Pen 20 for school work, thought it was a great idea. But, after spending 2 days attempting to install it on my Vista 64 bit OS I found out that the c-pen, although physicaly is the same, when it is sold from different companies it works with their own software. So, the ECTACO brand pen does not work on Vista 64 bit and I could not get it to work properly with Vista 32 either, although the tech told me it would if I downloaded updated software: It didn't even with the new software. So I was forced to return the pen. But do not be fooled there are different software manufacturers that all sell the same product: be sure you know your operating system and then find a software that works for it, because the software is not interchangeable between manufacturers... I tried!"
1,Ectaco C-Pen 20 Handheld Scanner,"Overpriced and overrated, this company website sucks, they're more into selling their new products more so then having a proper support link. I guess once you buy the product they don't give a @### about you. I find this pen scanner to be very awkward and it doesn't ever scan without multiple errors characters. I bought it based on the high rating and in the review section, I don't know what these people find so fascinating about it. But I was very disappointed, for short one-liner scanning it is okay, but any extensive use is frustrating. I scan into Microsoft Word and find it very frustrating. I have had this pen for a while without using it. So is too late to return it now. But I would never buy any products from this company, that's for sure."
4,An invaluable tool for academics,"After becoming a college researcher, I purchased the Ectaco pen to assist in doing my literature reviews with books and articles. For years I would hand type paragraphs and sometimes even pages of material to use in my papers. After speaking with my professor, she suggested this item and trust me it was worth every penny. Sure, sometimes you need to run the pen over certain sentences for it to be accurate but I think that has a lot to do with the placement of the pen versus the pen's accuracy. Additionally, the only downfall is if you are using a book that you made any type of marks in IE: pen underlining or circling, etc. you may find that the pen doesn't pick the sentence correctly. Ultimately, the product is worth its weight in gold even with the flaws; it beats hand typing everything. I much rather go back and correct a few minor mistakes."
2,Company unapproachable,"Which one works with Windows 7, 64 bit? Good luck trying to figure that out before purchase. I strongly advise any prospective purchaser to approach the maker and just try get product info before purchases. I found it a total deal-killer. Impossible. Very frustrating."
1,Wouldn't reliably work,"Well below 50% accuracy when scanning a graduate text (more or less normal font type and size, etc.). Tried it on some magazines and on the package contents (quick start guide) and it was slightly better, the time and effort to manually correct what it had scanned makes it slower than simply typing it in yourself."
1,Hard to use,"The circumference of the pen, where it needs to be held, is so big that its very difficult to hold the pen AND keep pressing a button (right next to where you are holding the pen) every time one needs to scan. The non circular construction of the pen (its flat) makes it even more difficult to work with."
4,It is truly AMAZING!! I'm impressed!,"The pen works really well. The accuracy is right on. I mostly needed it to scan my textbook so it could essentially type my notes for me. it was highly accurate and easily used. I can insert a return when i need to by one simple push of the function button. if you need it to scan text and throw it on your computer with ease this is the pen for you. its worth a try and def worth the money. my one drawback for me is it is NOT compatible with a mac. i have a macbook aluminum running os x and i spent a good amount of time trying to get it up and running and it was a no go. so the good thing was i have parallels and it worked out fine, but since on my parallels i don't have word i have to put it in wordpad then trasnfer it to word.the pen stays connected to the computer.it's extremely easy to use. just point and scan. the button on the tip of one of the legs turns on the light letting you know its scanning.it is really accurate and does what it is supposed to."
2,Very Disappointed....,"If you have plenty of time to retype or edit your work, this item is for you.You have to scan the words from your book very slowly and patiently, and in a particular angle. If you scanned a little bit faster than you're suppose to, you have to retype most of the words on your computer, you can't hardly make up the words that you scanned!I was very frustrated."
3,Good but not great.,"I am a bit of a scanning pen fanatic. I write papers and use them to collect research data. That is why I was excited to see that C-Pen (the best scanning pen manufacturer) had come out with a new model (the first in several years). My expectation was that this model would be far better than the C10 (the previous USB scanner) given the advance in technology since its release. I was pretty disappointed overall. This model is no quicker than the C10 and no more accurate. The software does not do as good a job as the C10 and it is not uncommon to have the pen miss an entire line of text. This is particularly important since I am often scanning very rapidly and don't take time to look up at the screen to see that the text is entered correctly.Overall, not as good as the C10 (which I would give 4 stars), but better than the Iris Pen Executive (2 stars).Please also note that this pen does not work with Mac computers (the only USB pen that does is the Iris Pen)."
4,The Only Choice for Pen Scanners!,"I am a money manager in NYC. I probably read over 150 pages of research everyday. In order for me to track ideas and not forget things it is important for me to have some sort of method to organize this information overload. My first purchase was the IRIS Executive pen. It did a horrible job of converting written text into MS WORD, the error rate was over 50% and made the task of cleaning it up twice what it would of been if I just decided to type it. I returned it within 5 days. I went ahead and purchased the C-PEN (with a return policy). What a Difference! I can run through 100 pages of research and condense it into 2 pages with minimal errors. Not only does it create legible conversion (over 90%) but once you lift the pen it creates a space for you..(no need to hit a button on pen) This is probably the only one that should be invested in, they have the idea and technology down pat. C-PEN has made my life easier!"
3,good,"in a general sense, this c-pen seems OK, but:- there shouldn't be too much light (this is a problem especially at night time, i.e. under a bulb)- you shouldn't expect too much accuracy; i'm using it for Turkish texts and the overall accuracy is around 80%.- quality of the book also effects the result- tables and figures can't be scanned, of course- and finally, you've to be connected to your computer during operation.Yet, i'm happy with this thing. It reduces the labour necessary to extract large amounts of text. Could be useful especially for PhD students."
5,dream pen,"Got my C-pen recently, and already have transferred so much text from books into my computer. It's a wonderful device with very well worked out software to ensure seamless operation. I would never need my flatbed scanner and OCR for scanning texts anymore, which is quite an unwieldy operation most of the time. Hope this product doesn't get discontinued anytime soon. I hope to be using it for a long time."
1,Bad out of the box,I'm very disappointed that I could not get my C-Pen to work on any of three machines and two operating systems (Vista and W7). There isn't much of a support website if you have problems. The only option is to use email to someone in Sweden who essentially told me to do what was listed on the website. Maybe I just got a ban pen? I really wanted this to work. Now I've got to send it back.
1,Terrible waste of money,"I bought the cpen in preparation for graduate school. I used it about five times, then I took a break from the cpen for a couple of months. When I picked it up again it didn't work. My repeated attempts to contact the manufacturer were met without response. Poor product, poor customer service."
1,"Don't buy thing, it's piece of junk","This product doesn't scan accurately, and is a waste of time and money. I think that says it all."
5,The Best !!!!,This is the best technical instruction book for shooting skeet. (same goes for his trap book). This is why the currently published books quote him extensively. One current book even reproduces 10 of Missidines's pages in their book. Why read it second hand -- go to the source. Fred's book is usually available used for much less than a newer publication. I have purcjased 9 of these books and given them to my nephews and nieces that shoot and five of my best skeet shooting friends.
5,A Jazz Locamotive!,"This album is a full throttle, non-stop, get-out-of-the-way, steam engine barrelling at you full speed ahead! It's a powerhouse.I have long been a fan of Maynard Ferguson and his bands. This album made me re-evaluate Diane Schuur. The first time I heard her years ago, she must have been having a bad night. She seemed flat and off-key. I never gave her a second listen. When I saw this cd in the store I figured the combination of Ferguson and Schurr might be interesting so I picked it up. I have definately changed my opinion of Diane Schurr.Few singers sing with her power or range. I can think of only a few, male or female, (Eydie Gorme, Mel Torme) who come close.In addition, the arrangements are fascinating and unique (check out Besame Mucho), and the musicians are in top form.I see Diane Schurr has an album with the Basie band (my all time favorite band). After hearing her on this album, I am eager to add that one to my collection as well."
2,Schuur Makes Me Wince!,"Why did I buy this CD? How do I get my money back?I grew up loving Maynard's sound (Live at Jimmy's is a classic), but these charts with Ms. Schuur are overbearing and at times ridiculous (Besame Mucho & My Romance come to mind immediately). The arrangements are heavy handed and lack the aestheic/sensitive qualities that even with this kind of ""big band"" instrumentation can be accomplished successfully.I could go on but won't do to you what was done to my ears. Save your money on this one and instead rush to buy any Tierney Sutton CD. With ""Swingin For Schuur"" I purchased Sutton's ""Unsung Heros."" Now here's a lady who can deliver a song!"
3,It's OK,"I think every baby is different...ours just thinks this is OK. He doesn't immediately calm down with it...sometimes he likes it, sometimes he doesn't."
5,You Can Soar Like an Eagle,"Nell provides for any believer or achiever the ability to go higher with Christ. As the illustrates comparing an eagle to people, she reminds the reader that Greater is He, Jesus, who lives in us than how we percieve the world. The simpleness of the book provides a wealth of understanding as she challenges with scripture and illustrative word to further grasp understand. Essentially, she offers that those on the ground are missing an eagles veiw of what this life with Christ. I am so greatful that my friend and spiritual mother taught me to go higher and dig deeper. As the words of Mohney proves, ""Greater is he than is in me that he was in the Lord.Karen"
5,One of the Best Reasons to get into Anime,"Patlabor is one of the best examples of what can be achieved through animation ever to be produced. While the series (meaning movies 1 & 2) could technically fall under the category of 'mecha', you won't find dragged-out robot battles here. The stories are intelligent and intriguing, sometimes even frustrating... The viewer is drawn into a complex mystery where the solution is just out of reach. The visuals are equally stunning! Disney simply can't hold a candle to this.In my opinion, these two films are far better than most live action television or cinema made in recent years. If you're getting tired of Toonami's chopped and dubbed versions of overplayed series and you're itching to see something with brains, you must add Patlabor to your collection. (As with any Anime title, I recommend getting the DVD version so one has the option of watching the subtitled version. The original voice casts are always better than English dubs.)"
5,The rare sequel that's superior to the original.,"I was fortunate enough to first see this movie on the big screen (in an indie house in Los Angeles), and having seen it as such can safely say that this really a movie that is best enjoyed in a theater. This is certainly NOT to say that the home video versions don't do the film justice---they definitely do. Even the English-language dubbing is first-rate, which is something that unfortunately can be said of few English versions of anime. But the grand scope of the giant-robot dominated universe of Japanese animation can only be truly appreciated on the movie screen...because as the American ""Godzilla"" (of all films) said, ""Size DOES Matter""...just ask anyone who's seen ""Akira"" or ""Ghost In The Shell"" in the theater. Big or small screen, see or get this flick, and ""Patlabor 1"" while you're at it."
5,Better Than the First,"I thought that the first installment was the pinnacle of anime, then I saw Patlabor 2. The animation is as crisp, and the music is as stirring. The story takes place a few years after the first film, and finds the members of the team farmed out to new police units. However, a war is brewing, and it's up to the Labor team to avert it and save the day! If you enjoyed the first movie, you're sure to enjoy Patlabor 2."
2,The worst audio track i have ever found on DVD!!!,"This is a great movie (just read the others reviews!), but once again Manga Ent. release a poor DVD edition... the english surround track is just unlistenable, it sounds like a realaudio clip streaming on 28.8k modem (Yes it's that bad; 8bit PCM samples sound better!), so trust me and save some bucks... :("
2,A great mystery with Lots of slow moments within...,This would of been a great Anime movie if it wasn't attached to a story I loved where all the characters I liked got pigeonholed holed into bit players. And it would of helped had they edited it a little more tightly to get to the frigging point.And the creator has this weird~ WEIRD fetish about basset hounds. His history with the mutt: 'Ghost in the shell'~'StrayDog: Kerberos Panzer Cops'(where his camera is used to be viewed thru a mutts eyes)~ 'Patlabor'~'Patlabor 2'~'Innocence'~'Sky Crawlers' and who knows what else I didn't see!The dude needs to go with John Woo and his own problem with white pigeons into a rehab center to fix these problems!
3,Patlabor in decline?,"Pros: Robots, the animation, and less Noa screen-time.Cons: Too political, Shinobu is annoying as usual, needs more Ohta, constant talking, more talking, talk, talk, TALK! >:[Final Verdict: A real keeper...as long it's cheap."
1,Patlabor 2 is TERRIBLE,"I have seen good anime, and this is not one of them. I agree that pointless violence is not a good thing in a movie, but this movie doesn't even move. It might as well be a series of still frames with talking dubbed over it. There's a scene near the end where the captain is talking with an ex-terrorist, and he has his back to the camera the whole time so they didn't even have to animate that. I'm not saying that I expect destruction and gore, but they could at least move around a little. They could at least go for a walk or something while they talk, instead of just showing one frame of animation for ten minutes while two people talk about war. This was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. I must admit that it had more of a point than the first one though."
1,Drag of an anime movie....,"This is NOT your typical Cowboy Bebop action anime. Rather it's about political intrigue and dialogue after diagolue that it left like I was watching a radio-show. Absolutely boring. I didn't care much for the animation either or even the characters. The characters look japanese this time, unlike what we're used to. I guess they want to make the story a more realistic trying to deal with mordern day issues.There's barely any action. I must admit that I couldn't finish the movie because it was way too boring with all the cloak and dagger stuff going on. Likely, I was able to get this from the public library. I would have been upset if I rented this movie. This movie is recommended to hardcore anime fans. Those of you looking for action, humor etc go watch Cowboy Bebop or something like that. Not this movie!!!"
5,6 stars,"This was an amazing movie. I am not a not of patlabor the tv series & after a couple, will not be keen to pursue it. But you don't have to be a fan of patlabor to enjoy, what I think is the BEST of the 3 patlabor movies.Everyone said the first one was the best. I disagree. This is the best because the dialogue & ideas presented is so thought-provoking that it is still relevant today, like the first Matrix. And the action that occurs toward the end is amazing in terms of damage.I am a fan of Mamoru Oshii's work & I think this is the best of his work. THe visual palette & detail is beyond compare. It was breath-taking to watch. I would just turn off the sound & play it on TV like a screensaver.I highly recommend this movie, especially you like clever dialogue ala British tv Yes Minister & inferential/deductive reasoning.Enjoy a great film"
1,Waking Indeed,"I heard this guy read, and I must say it was one of the most boring things that's ever happened in my life. It made standing in line at the DMV seem like ""Burning Man."" No wonder the guy writes so much about heroin. He is heroin personified. One dose of his poetry and you're nodding off."
4,Quite good but not everyone's cup of tea....,"This novel may offend prurient interests, however, it's an entertaining and spicy read for those not easily offended and/or those who can separate fiction from reality - aka those who can admit (at least to themselves) that what mentally arouses them in a novel may not be legal, morally desirable, or even what they actually practice in their bedrooms. Women are more or less objectified in the novel, and there are a couple rape/ravishment scenes. If the idea of ravishment/submissiveness/powerlessness (female) doesn't get you going, this book is probably not for you.However, as a whole, the sexual activity described in the novel hardly puts it in the top tier of taboo erotica/pornography."
1,Too Far,"While it's one thing to write about violent sex between consenting adults, this book goes too far when, in the first chapter, a fourteen year old girl is raped. ... I would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,2 reasons,"I am a huge fan of the written works of the great H.P. Lovecraft. The only two reasons to see this film are:The gorgeous and sexy as hell Elsa Pataky,andThe outtake during the credits of the mouse and the amputated penis fighting each other.You have to see it to believe it.For a real Lovecraft adaptation, I recommend Evil Dead, Castle Freak, or even the Hellraiser movies."
4,better than the second.not as good as the first,"This is a movie you will either love or hate depending on your veiw of the other two films.the first one to me is a cult classic and loved by many fans.the second one,in my opinion was not as good.this one to me is a return to what i loved about the first movie.the pace is fast and dosent drag like the second movie.the blood and gore are all decent and the story isnt that bad.jeffery combs is back in top form as dr.herbert west and i for one hope they make a forth re-animator movie.worth checking out if your a fan of the series,you wont be disapointed."
4,Brings it a step farther,These movies remind me of the old frankenstein movies. And this movie of course brings it a step farther to keep people in suspence. I think all the old movies should be redone like this one. And it is better to make them a bit different at the same time. Like I said about re-animator. You wont be dissapointed.
3,"Pretty Good, but Nothing Extraordinary","Being a big Re-Animator fan, when I first found out about the movie I was rather excited. When I went over to my local best buy, I was able to locate this movie and got home right away so I could watch this movie. After viewing it, I thought it was ok, but was let down a little. It didn't have the same shock and atmosphere of the two earlier ones. Probably my biggest complaint was the character development. You didn't really care what happened to the characters (except West) because they didn't give you enough time to know them . Plus I'd like to have an unrated version available. Perhaps that would help fill in the holes."
3,"Good, but where's the gore?","In the making-of, Director Brian Yuzna tells us that there's less gore in that movie than the previous two and it shows. In fact, that (and the bad acting from most of the actors) keeps the movie from becoming truly great. Otherwise, it's a fun movie that never gets dull but never acheives greatness either.The DVD itself is of good quality for such a movie. Good picture quality, sound is ok, there are a short making-of, a director commentary and trailers, and the music video is so bad it's a laugh.Because of its low price, it's worth a try if you're a fan of the series."
4,Re-Animator Goes Beyond,"I'm quiet happy with the third entry into the Re-Animator series. Brian Yuzna did an amazing job with this film. Brian's direction in the film is interesting. The effects are good, especially an inmates chest exploding. It's exciting seeing Jeffrey Combs return as Herbert West. After viewing it the obvious opinion is to think it's not better than the original, but of course it's not going to be. Over all the fans should be happy,I know I am.By Justine Ryan"
2,i wish it was better,"I just bought and finished watching Beyond Reanimator. I was expecting to see a more quality movie when I bought this, with cooler deaths, funnier dialog, and a more interesting story. Beyond Reanimator had all the ingredients to make a fantastic movie, I think (it seems apparent) that alot was not planned through, aspects were rushed and not all involved were passionate about creating this movie. If you really love the reanimator series buy it maybe you won't be dissapointed it's only 13 dollars, if you only like the original reanimator you may want to skip even renting this movie. -I sold my copy for six bucks at Coconuts."
2,Dissapointing Sequel,Jeffrey Combs returns as the very mad Dr Herbet West is this lame sequel to the original classic. Combs is terrific as usual and deserves a better movie. This one just uses the plot of the original movie but changes the setting to a prison. Gore hounds might enjoy it- but the effect are just ok. The DVD includes a hysterical music video that you have to see to believe. The making of segment is mostly in Spanish ( the film was made in Barcelona) with out English subtitles!
3,Same ingredients for the same recipe ! A good sequel !,"It's back ! And if you liked the 2 first movies, go for this 3rd one, I don't think you will be disappointed. You know the ingedients..Funny and gore. The SFX are signed by Screaming Mad George as usual and Yuzna is the director for the Fantastic Factory(DAGON rules). I was not disappointed at all. Jeffrey Combs is still the same MAD DOCTOR and ready as ever to raise the dead. The spannish actors are quite bad and you don't know why Dr West is in a jail in Spain but who cares ! Or maybe they try to let us believe we are in USA but well, there is a Police car in a scene not very US style ;) Anyway It's a cool sequel."
2,A BOMB of a flick except for a few good gore effects,"This sequel to a horror classic started out ok, but by the middle, none of it mattered anymore, I even got a bit tired of the well done gore effects because I had to sit through scenes of a severed [...] and rat duking it out! The original ""ReAnimator"" is a great flick to see if you want excellent and original gore effects as well as a creepy storyline, but this sequel just stinks."
1,Beyond Redemption!!,Not only is this a horrible sequal but a horrible film. Jeffrey Combs is the ONLY thing that makes this film palatable. Any scene that he is not in is truly boring and contrived. This is like a bad episode of OZ crossed with a horrible straight to video quickie. Just awful...absolutely awful.
3,Good.. but.. where's the gore ?,"This is a good movie in the good old 80's horror style with some hilarious episodes. It fits well to the two earlier Re-animator movies. But there's a big disadvantage that got it to loose two stars in my opinion. Either it is cut (god damn, are they really still cutting humour horror movies ? Greater horror !) or the great Brian Yuzna just put in less gore this time. Either case, this type of movies demands both much humour and much gore ! Brain Dead / Dead Alive is released uncut without problems. What's the f----n problem in doing the same with this movie ? Anyway, if you like re-animator 1 & 2 you must buy Beyond Re-animator and I thank Brian Y for doing it, but I sincerely hope that it will be released uncut very soon. Brian, we're waiting for part 4 already !"
2,"Inferior, But Cool","The 3rd in the series, and not nearly as good as the first 2, this one still offers some nutty, over the top performances and most importantly, gore. Don't start with this one and don't expect too much, but if you dig the first two, and want a wee bit more Dr. West, pick this one up used, cheap, and enjoy."
1,Compass fell apart,"I'm Army Infantry, in the field a lot. I knew when it arrived it wasn't going to last long. The actual compass is just glued to the rubber piece that slides over your watchband. After a few days in the field, I looked down and noticed the compass piece was gone, only the rubber holder there. I've had other brands of wrist compass' last a lot longer than a week."
5,Just what I ordered,"This was a book I had wanted for some time, but it was available only at local bookstores at a much higher price.I was glad to receive it in just a couple of days, in great shape, and packaged in such a way that not even the postal service could have harmed it."
2,"Tales and tall tales, mixed together.","This book consists of a bunch of stories about life on the Olympic Peninsula over the last century or so. Some of those stories come first-hand, while others seem to be tall tales. Even on a quick read, I was able to spot various factual inaccuracies, concerning names, dates, and units of the park and forest.Some of the most astounding stories may be accurate but stretch credibility in my mind. Murray takes them all in, uncritically.It's written in a lively style, so if you just want to read a bunch of oldtimer stories and don't care about accuracy, it would be fine."
3,HAPPY ST. PATRICK'S DAY!!!,"Because today is St. Patrick's Day, I thought I'd spend time with the big pimpin' Leprechaun! When some homies steal Lep's gold, he goes on yet another rampage to get it back. I love when Watson is trying to beat up Leprechaun, and it doesn't hurt him. If you love Leprechauns & Gangsta's, you'll love LEPRECHAUN: BACK 2 THA HOOD!!!"
3,Where has the magic gone?,"The Leprechaun series started out strong with the first three movies. Four was silly and five had way too much transsexual stuff in it for my liking - come to think of it, four had a military guy wearing a dress too.Anyway, Back 2 Tha Hood was a good addition to the franchise. The Leprechaun's sense of humor came back with a vengenance in this one - and I loved the scene where the thug is trying to act tough while is girlfriend is yelling at him on his cell phone.In the early movies, the Leprechaun only killed after giving people an opportunity to return his gold. In this one, he starts killing everyone - even if they had nothing to do with stealing his gold. Although there is a witch in the movie who uses magic, I was disappointed that the Leprechaun didn't use any this time out. He was a much more physcial threat.If you enjoy this series, I'm sure you'll like this 6th installment. Go ahead and go Back 2 Tha Hood."
2,Where were the the Leps funny riddles?,"I am a huge fan of the Leprechaun series, but I must say, this was a pretty bad one. It had some pretty funny scenes, but the Leprechaun never said any funny riddles like he did in all of the others. The main reason I like the series as much as I did was because I thought the Leprechaun was hilarious, but I didnt think he was in this one. As long as you arent expecting a whole lot, this is a very enjoyable film and was still much better then ""In Space""."
3,Ghetto Leprechaun,"Good sequel to the Leprechaun In The Hood, and hits the right notes for a ghetto in the hood mac demon. Homies and their girlfriends stumble on a chest of gold that doesn't run out, and Leprechaun want it the F back, badly, doing his usual number on all who happen to be in his way.If you like the wee little demon, then he will not disappoint, and that's all you really need to know about escapades on the west side of town."
5,Peace my ninja!,"What a hoot! I laughed my way through this whole movie! The characters were the perfect fodder for our mad Leprechaun friend. A bunch of terrible actors try to act 'ghetto', and are as convincing as a midget in a Superman costume. I mean c'mon give me a break. They acted out every bad cliche from 'Juice' and 'Boys in da Hood'.Now the movie itself is great. Ghetto Queen finds the treasure and passes it around to her homies. They buy what you'd expect, cars, jewelry, weaves, gold teeth, and an ample supply of marijuana. Well our little green friend 'don't play dat'. He kills with a bong, rips your fillings out, takes an electric razor to the eye, kills the rival gang, burns in a furnace, is shot with hallow point rounds (filled with four leaf clovers ha ha ha!!!), but best of all he kills two cops and steals their car. How can a leprechaun drive you ask? Easy! He rips the leg off one of the cops and uses it because he can't reach the pedals. Classic."
2,Mediocre chapter could have been better,"Mediocre describes this laughable direct-to-video with the Leprechaun going back to the hood and starting a killing spree looking for his gold. Basically a remake to Leprechaun in the Hood with terrible special effects and bad acting but this movie is so inept and hilarious its almost as absurd as Leprechaun 4 and this funniest parts are when the Leprechaun jams a bong in a man's stomach and when he rips a cop's leg off while wanting to fight. Watch only once or twice but stick with parts 1,2,3."
2,"Doesn't Compare to ""In The Hood""","Leprachaun 5: In the hood, was a cult classic. Mostly because of its political incorectness and chemistry between the main characters. However, in this one, the sixth installment, they tried too hard to be goofy. The jokes were lame, or rather they weren't executed well (like when the police confiscate a whole garbage bag of weed from the guy's house and he responds, ""Oh, dat stuuf, dat's oregano, my momma is ""Eye-tal-ian"" and she like lottsa oregano in her lasagna""). And the leprachaun doesn't talk (or rap)or blurt out riddles like he used to. And where are my ""zombie fly girls""?! Oh well, <sigh> I guess good things like ""In the hood"" don't last forever, just leave it to some knucklehead to go out and ruin something that was already divine."
2,What a letdown,"I'm a really big fan of this series, and had high hopes for this one, but it just fell flat. Too much of the human characters (I don't really CARE if bike boy is trying to ""do the right thing""), the Leprechaun got his backside whipped most of the movie, the killings were neither imaginative nor graphic, and there wasn't anything that really surprised me. The only really funny part was the bong scene, which was pretty much done in the first ""Hood"".How you can botch a Leprechaun movie is beyond me, but maybe it's the curse of the evens (the odd numbered ones are MUCH better than the evens). The end was pretty lame, too, and didn't make a whole lot of sense. Extras on the DVD were pretty much non-existent. I'll still buy the box set when it comes out, though. If you like this series, check it out just so you've seen them all, but this movie was a waste."
1,Gimmie me gold back! This movie stinks!,The first visit to the hood was crazy but fun. This one is neither. There is only one funny scene and no scary scenes...so what's the point?
5,Outstanding!,"This video, along with regular use of the clubbell, will undoubtedly take your fitness and strength to new levels. Be prepared to work muscles you never knew you had. Scott's instruction is clear and concise and he never sacrifices safety for showing off. The beauty lies in the gradual involvement of more reps or exercises as you progress. In essence, it's tailor made for your current level of ability. I can't say enough good about the video."
3,Useful but annoying to watch,"This video is a necessity if you train with clubbells. It is not well produced but it is the only one on basic clubbell training so you need to get it.It is produced very amateurishly; like on a home video recorder. The coach's verbiage is also irritating. It appears he is trying to sound highly technical so he used a lot of ridiculous jargon. He ended up sounding silly. This video needs to be viewed many times, so these defects become annoying."
3,"Little Donkey, BIG heart","One of Don Bluth's (Secret of Nimh, All Dogs Go To Heaven)earlier films, THE SMALL ONE tells the story of a tiny donkey and his boy. When the donkey becomes too old to carry the heavy loads that pay for his feed, his young master is forced to find him a new home... the market place is filled with people who are perfectly willing to work the little donkey to death, but after several near escapes, and almost giving up hope, that someone special comes along...Small One's message is quiet, but is ably put across... Gentleness is a strength too... I've seen this movie several times, and each time I find tears on my cheeks as the credits roll."
4,It Really Works Well!,"We just returned from 3 weeks in Europe relying on Route 66 to get everywhere. It's GREAT! I almost didn't purchase the program based on the first negative reviewer. But his problem was that he wanted names in American rather than the native language (and the road signs are in the native language!). (And if he really tried, he could have found his destination by clicking down by country and region.) It was difficult adapting my Delorme GPS to work, but with the help of Customer Service from Route 66, I did and then everything worked superbly all the way. Very easy, intuitive interfaces. More information produced than you'll ever need. What blew everyone away was that we were driving and someone wanted a rest stop. Two clicks and all rest stops were displayed, with one in five miles. Similarly, we found a marvelous lakeside restaurant 4 miles off an autobahn to stop for lunch rather than relying on highway service food. All in all an invaluable purchase!"
4,Quirky but complete,"A fairly complete road atlas but with a few quirks. First, all the towns/locations are in the native language. For example, to use another review's complaints, instead of searching for Florence, you have to search for Firenze. Instead of Rome, use Roma. The second quirk is that the interface with my Belkin GPS was somewhat spotty. Sometimes it works, sometimes not and I have not been able to figure out why. All in all though, I was happy with it (have not found any better Europe road atlas databases out there yet)."
1,Utterly useless...,"Honestly if I hadn't spent the better part of eighty bucks on this thing, I'd be laughing. The search couldn't find the town in Italy I'm visiting. So I thought I'd widen the parameter and just put Florence (which it is near.) No luck--that just brought up a bunch of streets in the UK. So I tried Rome. Nope, can't find that. How about the country? Italy? No, that just brings up some hotels, etc.So I tried to zoom in on the area the town is in and did manage to find it, though I still can't find Florence (despite knowing exactly where it is geographically.)I am not a computer map neophyte here. I've been using MS Autoroute for years, but it won't run on my PowerBook. I bought this thinking 'how bad can it be?' The answer: Worse than I could have ever imagined--and I'm a pretty cynical guy.Buy a paper map or get Virtual PC and run the MS stuff. Honestly, this is bad enough that I feel ripped off. (...)"
5,Just what I was looking for...,"I was looking for a well-made and detailed costume for Halloween, and this performed admirably. It has solid construction, and many good details. I can't speak to how it serves practitioners of ninjitsu (I practice aikido, myself), but I was quite pleased."
4,Great Album,Mr. Heyert's got it right. Mississippi John knows what he's doing. The revisited CD was quite enjoyable and i would recommend it to any soul lover. He plays a great harmonica which you cant help but notice.
2,Ok for the money,It looks better than it is because it's pretty light plastic.Will be ok for light duty tasks
3,A tour book more than a rail book,"This was not what I expected. Rather than a thorough presentation of rail timetables, this book is a touring book. It gives all the usual hotel, sightseeing, etc. information, for selected cities and attractions. The small cities I care about - detailed route maps, connections, schedules, etc. - are not covered. Thomas Cook apparently publishes another book with complete European rail timetables.Also, the text in this book while readable (I'm 68 years old) is small, and slightly challenging. Information printed as city maps is much too small for me to read."
3,Show-and-Tell Surprise,"This silly story has such unrealistic show-and-tell items as a ship's anchor, a carved coral bust, and a Jamaican steel drum. Of course, Clifford is the best show-and-tell offering of all. Children who love Clilfford books may enjoy this one."
3,nice cables,well i must say hdmi cables are just what i needed nice & flat fits in tight spot when multable cables are used price of cables were great shipping was not happy with that im a first time buyer for amazon.comi the type of guy who just buys what he needs on the spot and thats it !!my girlfriend told to look on line found bought them oh well bad me next time maybe not next day or express ship
1,Very disappointing,"Similar to how ""Planets Of The Universe"" was for Stevie Nicks in 2001, this track was supposed to be somewhat of a dance/club breakthrough track for the Pretenders. Unfortunately, this single turned out to be a huge disappointment and has been all but forgotten at this point.Jr. Vasquez usually hits in his productions but sometimes he misses badly - this being one of those cases. Here you have 7 of his mixes to choose from, and none of them make the grade. Junior's Earth Anthem had a lot of potential, but the vocals are too underutilized and the track has a rather bland and choppy production.Not surprisingly, this track failed to catch on at U.S. dance clubs. It missed the top 20 of the Billboard dance/club chart, and may have missed the entire dance chart altogether (I'm not sure).I love Chrissie Hynde and she's had some great dance floor collaborations (most notably Tube & Berger from '04). But ""Time"" is not one of them."
5,Great book!,"For someone who has either started a business, is considering starting a business, or wants to be a great employer/employee is is a great option. No, it doesn't only talk about ""Firing someone today"". It is a book with business sense which when reading it makes common sense."
3,Table saw belts,I bought 3 of these belts to replace the old ones on my Powermatic 66 saw. Made in Mexico. Never would have bought them had I known that. Anyway they work but they are not all the same in length. They are 3 different lengths to tell the truth. Time will tell if the shorter ones will stretch with time and usages. They were a excellent price though.
5,Spice Cupboard,I ordered this just because I love the Pistoulet items. Arrived in perfect condition and I love the way it looks on self.
2,Left in the rain?,"Expected more from amazon, it looks like it was sitting out in the weather. But it works. It was missing one of the clips but manager to salvage from my old one. Ya get what you pay for."
1,Not new product,"The 70 amp breaker arrived in a nicely padded box. That's the end of the good review. The breaker trip bar cover was broken (the piece of plastic that overs both switches so they throw at the same time.) If the bottom side trips, the top will not get pulled along with it.On further inspection, this is not a new breaker. There are obvious signs of wear at the circuit connection, main bus connection which was also bent, and the J-hook ends. The sides are also scuffed where it rubbed up against other breakers.Very disappointed... being returned."
4,Great cajun music,"A few years ago, i had the opportunity to see Les Freres Michot play at Prejeans in Lafayette, LA when i was driving through Louisiana with my dad. What a great time! I bought this CD there, and i still listen to it frequently.There are plenty of great tunes on this disc... it always puts a smile on my face, and always makes me wish i could get back to Cajun Louisiana SOON.Cheers from Buffalo, NY! Highly recommended!"
4,It takes one to know one,"How to be a vampire is about Andrew and his friend T.J. They love monsters. But their favorites are vampires. But one day , Andrew slept upside down, was atracted to red,could'nt eat garlic, and could'nt cross rivers and dogs loved him. But T.J. thinks he's a vampire, but he denies.Then his vampire teacher comes. But is he prepared to suck blood and sleep in a coffin"
4,Hawaii's gift to the wor,"Nina Kealiiwahamana is one of the finest female vocalists I have heard and it is refreshing to hear Hawaiian music sung mostly in the Hawaiian language.Jack de Mello is a gifted arranger, but the score was over orchestrated in many places for this genre of music, however I don't regret the purchase."
5,The Lawyers--A Review after 36 Years as a Lawyer,"I started law school in 1971 and read The Lawyers in 1970. I believe Mayer meant, in some ways, for it to be an insult to the legal profession. But completely missed the mark with his comments about the name of the book, something to the effect of ""I call them lawyers instead of attorneys because that's what the phone book does."" My Father always wanted to be called a lawyer, not an attorney, he felt some kinship to the English Barrister system, HE went to court, attorneys had an office practice. Lawyers is not an offensive term. The book is a good review of law school at the time, it had not changed in 75 years and taught you only to be a law student, not a lawyer. Which I suspect is still the case. I would recommend the book to anyone, an inside peek at the life of a lawyer. I still think so after 36 years."
5,Nice and sick...,"Although this isn't a full-length CD, CROSS SPECIES TRANSMUTATION offers a taste of Malignancy's sound. Top-notch instrumentation and memorable riffs combine with the terrifying,Cronenbergian lyrics of Danny Nelson,who is one of the best vocalists in the genre."
1,Dead on arrival,"It just flat out didn't work when it arrived. Installed the software, then plugged it all in and nothing. Just one green light. I tried both wired and wireless. I sent it back after reading the number of folks experiencing similar problems. I tried calling support first, but just got to hear music before it hung up on me."
1,Completely Worthless,"This product is the largest waste of money ever. It dosen't do half of the things that it claims it does, it almost never plays DIVX or XVID files correctly, and its not even supported by prism anymore. Thats right, prism has stopped updating their software and pretty much left this product out to dry so they could work on new hardware. The hardware interface is horrible, the computer interface is horrible, and every time i turn of the player there is a 50/50 chance that it will freeze when starting up next time. If you want to waste your money, then this is the product for you."
3,Prismiq Wireful Media Player -- Not Wireless,"If you can get this to work with a Linksys WRT54G router and a Linksys WPC54G PCMCIA card, 50 feet away, through two walls, you're a better man than I am. I'm not so sure it'd work 5 feet away through no walls with any router or wireless card. BUT IT WORKS GREAT WITH 100 FEET OF CATEGORY 5 CABLE! Also, if you plan to try this wireless, make sure you read their list of supported wireless cards. It's a very short list. I think this unit is overpriced considering its wireless performance. Other than my disgust of having to run 100' of cable through my house, I like it."
1,PRISMIQ Has Poor Customer Service,"Written 4/2/04. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.I purchased the Prismiq Media Player before Christmas and was unable to get it working. After numerous emails to the Support Center, they stopped responding to my messages for two momths. I asked to return it and they said that they needed to get a ""RMA"" - return merchandise authorization to me, which they never did. When I finally got a reply (late March) they told me to return it to the retailer, who after all this time refused to accept it.I have written to PRISMIQ senior management team, bypassing the Support Center: the CEO, Vice President, Marketing; Vice President, Sales; and Vice President, Operations. Hopefully, I will get some results.There are other ways to get MP3 files to your home stereo - I would recommend the Pro HiFi-Link, which is cheaper, easier to set up, and works well."
2,"""Vapor"" Product? (still shows 2 available - I'm still waiting)","I infer no ill will here -- but why show ""2 available"" -- when my order has been delayed twice now? I ordered on Jan 2 2007 -- and now the latest Amazon message says maybe March 16th it might ship. I don't think I've been charged yet (haven't checked) -- and again I infer now ill will -- it's just a bit strange. I know this is a closeout product -- and no big profit margin for anybody -- but still... :("
1,Great idea -- poorly executed,"I was excited to receive my Prismiq Media Player with the hope that I could finally integrate my television, stereo, and computer-based music, video and photo collections.It was not to be.The Prismiq Media Player does not live up to its promise. I was able to browse the web, listen to nearly flawless internet radio (the best quality streaming media I have ever heard) but when it came to listening to my WMA files over a wired 100mbps network, the music skipped and popped worse than a scratched CD--worse than an old vinyl LP. Sadly, the unit does not appear to be defective. After a few calls & emails to Prismiq's rather sub-par tech support, I have given up.Save your money until this product is ready for prime time."
1,Support not as advertised,"I purchased the PRISMIQ Media Player based on the reviews both editorial and customer in December. Even though it was advertised to work with ""G"" wireless I was able to only get it to work via plugging cables into it, this defeated the purpose of the media player. I placed numerous calls for support and never received anything that made the device work properly. The PRISMIQ support finally sent me a 20 line patch for the software that I needed their keyboard in order to enter. After nearly a month of trying to get it work I returned the product and will wait on a product that performs as advertised."
2,A lot of promise but little follow-through,"I've had this product for almost a year now. It doesn't play what most would consider ""DVD quality"" although it very viewable. It does not play 5.1 audio, only 2 channel. These things could be lived with, but the customer service is abysmal. There seems to be only one person that knows what he is talking about. Unfortunately, to get to that one person, you have to run the gauntlet."
1,Not Ready for Prime Time - not even the Soaps.,I agree with many of the negative reviews here. I say ditto. After trying several adapter cards and being no closer to being set up I gave up and returned the unit and all the adapter cards I tried
1,Insecure,"Unfortunately, the Prismiq Media Player only works on insecure wireless networks. As of 07 January 2004, Prismiq does not support WPA.When asked about security, Prismiq support recommended that I disable WPA on my wireless network and rely on the very insecure WEP instead. They made no mention of additional steps that I might want to take to better secure a WEP encrypted network, such as not broadcasting the SSID. Is this an indication of how seriously Prismiq takes network security? Does the Prismiq media player pose a risk as an easy point of entry into a wireless network? I returned mine."
1,The most frustrating Xmas ever,"I have finally sent this back after a month of trying to get it to play more than one song before locking up. It simply does not work as advertised. It locks up constantly, the media server software is a CPU hog (I have a P4 3Ghz) and crashes all the time, the media manager software is amateurish, it constantly loses connection to the wireless network and when it does so you have to hard reset the unit. I mean losing the connection is one thing but having to pull the plug is ridiculous. The interface is very poor and slow. Tech support is laughable. They actually told me that they didn't know when they could help me because they were too busy working on their new DVR hard drive version!! Disappointed is a great understatement."
4,"Innovative and Smart, but A Bit Challenging","This device does a lot of things for an incredibly low price. I use it for listening to my music collection, streaming the Rhapsody music service and listening to Internet radio. Purchasers should DEFINITELY read through the Prismiq forums (at www.prismiq.org) and also make sure to get a SUPPORTED wireless card if planning to use for wireless. Some of these cards are hard to find and/or discontinued. Once I found one and installed it, the unit worked beautifully on my wireless g network. Sound quality is very good, the Rhapsody interface is really great and the ability to add any .pls or .m3u radio station is great (I've added about 50 stations from all over the world). Haven't tried phone support, but every email I've sent to Prismiq support has amazingly been answered in under 30 minutes. Recommended for those who've got a bit of basic networking knowledge to work the set-up properly. Once this thing gets going, it's really great."
1,"Unit was a failure out of box, No Support","I followed the directions and to my surprise the unit would do nothing but cycle over and over. I called the support number and was put in a que listening to the same 3 min track of piano music only to be transfered to a voicemail box afer about 10 min.Looks Like I will be returning it.days later and still no call back from support, I have returned the unit for a new one and it actually gives me the home screens etc. I hoped to get at least the ability to play music out of this device but find that even after firmware updates it gets more and more flaky.I can maybe squeeze a song or two out but expec to reboot the PC and this unit everytime you use it I am running a machine that is above specs for this unit and can get some use sometimes definatly wouldnt trust it at a party. I will be returning it for goodtrying the Linksys product next.dont waste your money unless you like the abuse and can return it fairly easily."
2,Thank god for XBMC!,"Thank god for XBMC, I dumped my prismiq device years ago, it was a pioneering product, but with not so great support. The company was trying to bite off more than it could chew and could not make the box work as described.The company was very helpful in giving me a refund for the purchase price, so I think they were very honest and that is not very common in today's cut-throat world. That is why I gave them 2 stars.Goodbye PRISMIQ, it was great using your product as I learned about watching personal videos on my TV! Kudos for being at the forefront of the tech wave.Hello XBMC!F."
2,Extraviada,"Es el 3er CD de Edith, antes de su fabuloso regreso con Quien te Cantara? pero extraviate se pierde en notas desalentadoras imitando a la Pantoja, la direccion en el genero ranchero es muy pobre y se torna el CD soso y aburrido. Es una pena la gran voz de Edith desperdiciada. Un par de canciones rescatables solamente."
2,Don't let the slick cover fool you.,"I should have done my research with this movie. It's extremely low-budget, unofficial documentary in the style of a VH1 special, but not as good. Therer's some kind odd stock footage of strip clubs and concert crowd footage used as something to look at whlie the narrator is talking. This superfluous footage is repeated something like 20 times. When the guy runs out of stuff to say, thry play generic metal riffs that aren't Ozzy or Black Sabbath.I gave this a second star, because there is a real interview with Ozzy Osbourne in there, and something we haven't seen before, an interview with the people that threw the bat on stage during that famous incident.Anyway, if you are a hardcore fan like me, I'd just rent it. It's not any kind of sanctioned release, and there is no Ozzy music of any kind. Most fans will know the basic Ozzy story, also. Don't let the awesome cover fool you."
2,frustrated,"Has anyone out there ever received, or found at a store, this rug with a blue border? If so please email me at FAnneHein@aol.com Unfortunately, I too received one with the burnt orange border and find it awful! This body of the rug is adorable, but the orange border detracts from the animals and the other nursery items. Frustrating is that when I contacted Target.com they assured me that they would send a replacement which would be correct, but it was not. They now tell me that they will look into the discrepency of what is pictured and what is being shipped, but that is all they can do. I think they need to update the picture or if both are available at some point, give customers the option of choosing the color they prefer. The rest of the Safari collection is wonderful, though tough to locate the accessories. If you have some of the small items for this collection, I'm interested! Email me!"
3,Not as pictured,When the item arrived it had a burnt orange border. At first I didn't really like how it looked but I found a perfect spot for it and it looks very nice. Still I would have preferred for it have arrived as pictured.....Oh wellAll in all I'm in love with this pattern! I searched everywhere for a pattern that my husband and both liked and this was the only one that we could agree on. Just had a hard time finding all the pieces to it.... But - I did it! :)
2,Item not as pictured,"Buyer beware! The rug that is pictured is not what will arrive. I received my rug yesterday and the border is not blue as described, it is burnt orange and doesn't really look right next to all the other bedding. I was disapointed with the quality as well. I am returning the whole safari collection and picking a new nursery theme."
2,Had to send back,I was a bit disappointed when I received the rug. It wasn't as soft as the picture on-line. It seemed more appropriate to hang on the wall rather than to have the baby playing on. I do like the other Safari items though.
4,Cute little rug,"The rug is cute, one thing I wanted to mention was the one I was sent had an orange rim around it instead of blue. Otherwise it's a good looking small nursery rug that goes great w/the collection."
4,Orange Border,"This rug is adorable, but I also received the orange border. I called twice to specify that I wanted the blue border, and was send the orange border both times. I decided to keep it because it is so cute, and the orange is the same as the orange in the lion and giraffe. But I am a little disappointed and would have preferred the blue. Still, I can't imagine the room without this rug!"
5,"Lots of fun, in ways you never thought of!","I heard Laura Corn on a Washington, DC radio station, and thought her book would be a great idea for a gift for my husband. However, I'm not sure who has gotten more out of that gift, him or me! We both look forward to a new seduction while smiling about that last one. Way to go Laura!"
5,Keeping dates alive and mysterious with the one you love,"This was purchased as a gift. An attempt to get romance back into a 21 year marriage relationship that has gone a little stale. The book was recommended by my niece in Canada. She and her husband absolutely love it! They have alot of fun with the romance and dates!!! A great gift for a new couple and a fabulous gift for a well seasoned, getting predictable couple."
4,Make Sure That You Do Not Have Dry Clean Only Clothes On,I have got to say this this book has brought me evercloser to haveing more time. Takeing my clothes on an off took me five mins now I save all of that time just make sure that you do not have on any dry clean only clothes on (my bills are in the thousands) and my drycleaner is starting to look at me weerd.
1,Too much is assumed,"There is one problem. Laura Corn seems to automatically assume that the woman stays at home all day. Well this is kinda hard for us, considering my husband and I both work the same hours, so anything that requires preperation while your husband is at work is out the window for us. What a waste of money."
3,8 Years later,"We've been married for 8 years and those who have been married or involved for any length of time know that romance gets lost after a couple of years, add a child or two and forget it. This book is an excellent aid for those who realize the romance has faded and want to do something about it and/or come up short in the imagination department. We've had a lot of fun with this but caution those who work shifts. I work midnights and that has put a damper on things. You really need to be in a situation where you spend your evenings together.As some of the others have mentioned there are some goofy things suggested. But if you put that aside and go with it you will have a good time and come up with ideas of your own. Some of the things I considered really stupid were the ones my wife really enjoyed. As I mentioned before this book will really benefit those who have the same schedule."
2,Stereotypical and cliche.,"If you get your idea of romance from movies and Harlequin novels, this is the book for you. My wife bought it for us and we were quickly disappointed. The book assumes an awful lot about men and women. First, it assumes the woman doesn't work full-time. My wife was not too happy about that assumption. Even worse, though, it assumes that romance is something that can be the same for everyone: conventional, prepackaged and cloned from couple to couple. The whole concept of the book is flawed. In reality, romance is spontaneous and unique to each couple. It can't come from the pages of a book written by a stranger. Our copy of this book (because of the tearaway pages) is now in the recycle bin."
5,Motown Magic,"Lionel Richie is best known for his ballad work and they show up quite liberally in this anthology of The Commodores. The band's only two number one hits, the sweet ""Three Times A Lady"" and the gorgeous ""Still"", both fall into that category, but the band could get down. Songs like ""Machine Gun"", ""Slippery When Wet"" and the ubiquitous ""Brick House"" are funk filled gems. ""Sweet Love"" is a beautiful, soaring song and ""Just To Be Close To You"" is another lush track. ""Oh No"" is one of the band's best songs and other strong tracks include ""Heroes"", ""Sail On"", the Marvin Gaye tribute ""Nightshift"" and ""Lady (You Bring Me Up)""."
5,Holistic - Deep ... Inspirational ... Soulful ... Spiritual !!!,"The Commodores' ""Anthology"" is indeed a masterpiece!With lyrics so deep and real, the musics touch the soul from the crown of the head way down to the soles of the feet!""Jesus Is Love"" [CD2:Track #10] is my anthem!In the late 70s, when I was a child, my daddy used to play, among other musics, the Anthology Album [LP]everyday and especially on Sundays. ""Jesus Is Love"" is so spiritual ... so inspirational ... so deep ... so touching ... so moving ... so profound ... so much so that each time I listen to the song I am so filled with goose bumps, that I am brought to tears - literally.I had to get this CD ... it's one of the best gifts that I have given myself!"
1,"A vile, bile book","If you want a cartoonish/Soap Opera-like history, with it's ready made villains and it's ready made hero's, then this book would certainly would be for you.However, if you want something more substantive and objective analysis then I recomed books by Armstrong, Bernard Lewis and Esposito...(I think it should be pointed out that Mr Trifkovic is well known for his views -which are incredibly right-wing and belligerant- he writes for an online website [which is more far-right then the NeoConservatives in the Bush admin.] and [political position?: You guessed it, ultra conservative] magazine, whose political position is slightly to the of left of Genghis Khan, he's one of those few proponents who think the atrocities of the crusades were insignificant and basing this stance of his on dubious evidence which many have disputed and challenged him on)"
1,Trifkovic: a Serb who hates Muslims,"Mr. Trifkovic, shame on you. I am really surprised how many people bought the book without checking on author's history, which was closely related with the biggest genocide in Europe after the second world war.Its enough to do a google search to find out who ""Mr"" Trifkovic is.Here is a good starting point:http://www.warandpiece.com/blogdirs/001081.html"
