3,Helps dry out wound,"When I get a wound healing seems to be delayed if I use the typical antibiotic creams that keeps it moist. I need something to dry out the wound, BFI does that. I like that it is an antiseptic. This purchase was a test to see if it is better than Dollar Tree body talc with salicylic acid that works fine even though salcylic acid is not supposed to be applied to an open wound. This seems to be a good product except for the price."
3,BFI Powder,The product is fine for what I bought it for-(to use for my dog who had an allergyissue) and cover up the loss of coat he had and blend in with his coloring-that's what I bought it for.BUT-the shipper shipped it to me too LATE so it was not helpful because I did not get it in TIME! :(
5,Best ever used for scabbing over.,My Mother used BFI powder on us when we were kids and it has always had a place in the medicine cabinet. Clean the open cut and then put the powder on and just let it take in the liquid and it will form a scab within an hour. I am still using it 65 years later. Better than the creams because it drys out the cut quickly. I have never had an infection using this.
5,Heals brushburns fast!,"After I fell and scrapted up my knee, I used an antibiotic ointment for about 2 weeks. The brushburn still looked like it was infected and not healing. I remembered my mother using this, and within a few days, the brushburn was healing nicely."
5,Simply The Best !!!,"This game is so adventurous and fell with hard core action nonestop . All your favourite weapons.Just the looks of the coverjust gives u this feeling. I've played all the Syphon Filter releases so far. Yes it is a bit hard at first when you've just started,but in the middle of the game when you have got the hang of it you would'nt wantto stop playing. And the graphisc was alright. So I gave it five stars."
4,A sequel to a awesome game!,"This game is awesome. I got it the day it came out and I'm empressed. Even though i thought it'd be hard but it wasnt it is extremly ez. you can play as many more charcters than syphon 2. Something that i was empressed with was the new mini games, you can play capture the briefcase and many more. SYPHON FILTER GAMES ARE THE BEST! I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS GAME."
3,Nothing Special,"I loved the first one, the second was not as good and now the third is really disappointing to me. After several missions the story line is really poor. The action is about the same but the controls seem a little different, everytime I go to peer around a corner or I bump the other analog stick Gabe jumps out and gets shot. The game does offer some unique new weapons. Maybe the game will improve later in the story but my suggestion would be to rent it before buying it. I wish I had rented it first."
3,Not Quite As Good As The Others,"After purchasing Syphon Filter 3, I was very dissapointed in what i waited 2 months to have. S.F.3 is no where near the first two.Its graphics are amazing,the story is fine,but the length and the difficulty is pitiful.I beat the game in 2 days-and no-I wasn't playing all day-maybe 2 hours each day.Is is very short compared to the first two-but the mini games and the better 2 player game does make it a little better.If you're looking for a challenging game that is worth the money-stick to the first to Syphon Filter's-but if you want a kinda short-""shoot em up"" game thats relatively easy-then this is the game for you.Oh yeah-sounds and graphics are AMAZING."
3,Is this truly a sequel?,"I reserved a copy of Syphon Filter 3 as soon as I heard that it was coming out. I could not wait for it, but with everything pushing back the release date, my anticipation grew. I picked up the game on the day it was released, and instantly was hooked. However, I found it to be nothing of a sequel. SF2 was more difficult than this one. The only good thing about SF3 was the story line. I hate to say it, but I truly think that the price is way too high for this game. If you beat SF and SF2 with some difficulty, then you will have no problem beating this one. I beat it in 4 days - AND I WORK OVER 50 HRS A WEEK!!! (...)"
5,Why isn't it rated 5 stars,"I can't believe some people didn't give this game 5 stars. You get to play as more than one person and more than two but three. The graphics are good and the graphics of the movies are almost perfect, plus the game is great. The game is very challenging. The levels are very long with as many as 16 objectives and many checkpoints. I am only on the fifth level but I still have fun losing. I also like the idea of the game trying to stop a virus and you are accused for crimes you didn't commit. The game has awesome weapons like the taser and the M-79 and the Mil-15. Isuggest you get this game. Syphon Filter 3 does have a share of violence though."
4,An Average Shoot Em Up Game,"This third installment of the Syphon Filter series does't at all disappoint. But it doesn't exactly meet expectations either. For their third time Gabe Logan and Lian Xing are going once again against the agency. This time they go back into the past to recount their previous missions including places like South Africa, Japan, and Ireland to stop the agency from using the virus. The plot isn't too different from the second part and has nothing new. Another thing I noticed was the length of it. I easily finished this much quicker than the second. The graphics are not all that much better, just the video clips, and you can only see their mouth move. It's a good game to play if you have both Syphon Filter 1 and 2 and you want to find out what happens to them and Mara Aramov. Other wise I would stick to the first or second part and get this with some extra money that you have laying around."
5,SF3- - - Awesome Game!,"This is one of the greatest games for PS! I just rented it last night, and I love it! It isn't your typical Shooter game. It has the most unique levels: In what game have you seen where you have to snipe people from another building and kill a terrorist leader? And at this point in the world, you would want to have the chance to kill a terrorist group leader, right. This game is Awesome and I highly recommend it. Buy SF3"
1,AWFUL JUST AWFUL!,"This game is [junk] the worse shooting game i ever saw. i put it in my ps1 and only played it for 10 minutes and i never played it again. ... but this game is [junk] if you want a good shooting game buy final doom for ps1. note* i never played syphon filter 1 and 2 before, but 3 is [junk]. i'm going to sell it ..."
3,Good...but not great,"If your a die-hard Syphon Filter fan, as I am, you will enjoy this game.The new levels and scenery are always a good thing but this game isnt as good as the first two. I almost get the feeling that these levels were the rejects for the first two series.It seems to be put together haphazardly. Lots of ""maze-like"" levels which Ive never liked a whole lot. The more I play it though, the better I like it."
4,good speakers...cheap price,well let's see...this was my first hugh purchase online...didn't know what to quite expect. speakers arrive after a gig i had...most importantly the 12'inch woofer unattached to speaker box. i guess the package wasn't good enought to hold the woofer in place...will have to reconsider if i will order a large pkg again from amazon..
1,Don't waste your time...,"I bought this product because it was free after rebate and thought it would work well with my new CD burner. Wrong, wasn't worth my time, and still no rebate received. You use all the labels that came with the software just trying to fiquire out how and what to print. The online portion of the program didn't work either."
4,Pretty Good,"This is a very good product. You can make a CD label from any art that you have on your computer or camera. The only drawback is that it is kind of difficult to understand in the beginning. Also, if you want to edit a picture, there is no way to copy a color from the picture in order to spray-paint out something you do not want on the label. Other than that, I highly recommend this. You can purchase other labels separately (any brand) and they will work with this."
5,My CDLabler,This is a great product!! It helps you make great CD labels! You can make them look really neat ...your kids will love this!!
3,No Diagrams,This would have received a 5 star if the diagrams were included. I feel like I've wasted my money and will have to look elsewhere for a decent digital copy
3,Loose connector problem's been fixed.,"Kensington technical support says the power tip (type N23 for Powerbooks) has been improved. Based on this, and good reviews by users who didn't have tip problems, I'm buying one. Here's Kensington's email response to me:Please note that we have a new improved N23 tip now; so please reply with your complete shipping address and daytime telephone number, with your area code so that we can send you one N23 tip for free. Be sure to include the apartment number, mailstop, or suite number, as well as your ZIP or Postal Code."
1,"great idea, poor execution","Don't buy this product if you'd like to recharge your PowerBook while driving. It doesn't put out sufficient voltage, the plug tip fits too loosely in the computer, and there's no lighted ring (as on Apple's AC adaptor) to indicate that it's made or lost a connection.My solution was to buy a Xantrex XPower Pocket Inverter 100 and a spare Apple AC adaptor. The two together are only slightly more expensive than the Kensington but work perfectly, put out the proper voltage, and let me glance at the light and immediately know if the battery's charging or fully charged."
1,Doesn't work,I purchased this product to charge my iPod video on a recent flight. The adapter fit into the flight power but the iPod kept blinking that this product was inoperable with my iPod and to disconnect. What a waste. I loathe taking the chance of its not working on my next trip when I take my Powerbook along.
2,falls off the wall,this phone is hard to place on the wall and falls off easy. I cannot clear the messages . However the id does work. also you have to dial slowly. the cord should be longer too.
3,Not what I was looking for.,"The major drawback of this book from my standpoint is that all of the Phoenician samples have been transliterated into the Hebrew alphabet. I'm not sure whether this was the original intent of the author or was a later cost-saving measure on the part of the publisher. Thus there is a peculiar section on ""The Alphabet"" which in fact never presents a single Phoenician character. Aside from this problem, the treatment appears to be straightforward and thorough, although I didn't keep the book long enough to find out just how clear the explanations are. You might find this book of use if you are interested strictly in comparative linguistics, or perhaps travelling back in time and conversing with some Phoenicians. But for reading Phoenician inscriptions, it is of quite limited utility."
3,Good way to start,"The book was pretty basic, and it made me curious to learn more. With the new background, I checked out a few more advanced books, and settled on ""Security Analysis on Wall Street,"" by Jeff Hooke. I trade a fair amount andf I'm starting to do more analysis before buying stocks."
2,Excellent Introductry book with too many errors,"Excellent introductry book. However, there are too many errors in this book -- all formulas need to be checked and corrected."
3,Missing Persons...,"I agree with Malixe, only about half the acts on this DVD qualify as glam. They are of the time period (except Tom Robinson, who is about four years later) but not of the genre.The nice thing about it is hearing a few live versions of favorite songs by favorite glam acts. That's why I've given it three stars.The thing that kills me is the acts that are missing. Undoubtedly this is because of rights issues or somesuch, but where are Slade, Gary Glitter, Alvin Stardust, Mott the Hoople, David Bowie, or even, uh, Chicory Tip?The DVD seems to have been made, not by a lover of Glam, but by someone trying to figure out how to package and sell a bunch of old TV clips of people in funny clothes they have lying around in their archives.Good for half of what it's got. Bad for what it's missing."
2,Ugh!,Half of these acts are not Glam.All the clips are ruined by cheezy graphics that ride over the first 10 seconds of each featured artist's performance and make the transitions look like they were edited together by somebody who'd only had an introductory course in community college.They butchered some fairly interesting footage here with worse than bad editing and filling it out with fluff like David Cassidy . Idiots.
4,Trey is Awesome,"While this can't compare to his work in Phish, it is a great effort and worth buying. Very cool album."
4,Great price and it is a manual umbrella,"- Great price- The material overall is good- It is manual so be careful when you open it, I hurt my finger when push it open, the little clip that holds the umbrella open up is sharp."
4,"Good, Inexpensive Umbrella","This umbrella is large, however you are immediately deceived by its weight. Because of body is made of something other than steel/aluminum/wood, it's very light, despite being the size of a golf umbrella. The weight feels like that of an umbrella half its size. The weight and strength is definitely a plus.The reason that I gave it only 4-stars is that it is not auto-open or auto-close. It is manual open and shut. Although I do not mind that I have to do this, since it is large, it can sometimes be cumbersome to open in a hurry.The umbrella is not perfect but it is very inexpensive. It looks stylish and I'm pleased to use it."
1,Broke in first ten minutes in the rain,"Took the umbrella out during a San Francisco storm. Medium wind. The upper part is connected to the lower part of the umbrella with STRING. The upper part separates from the lower part when wind comes in so that the full umbrella doesn't turn inside out. This was effective for about five minutes. Then, string by string, the strings connecting the upper and lower parts of the umbrella began to break - within 10 minutes the umbrella was useless and I walked home soaking wet. To make matters worse, the umbrella comes in a huge box, which I put in a recycling bin. Now to return it I will have to pay for another box and packaging, and I found no way of getting in contact - through amazon - directly with the manufacturing and must pay for the return of a defective product. Unimpressed!"
4,So far so good,"I've only used this umbrella a few times since purchasing, but it's been great so far. Very durable and surprisingly lightweight. Happy with my purchase!"
4,Intech Windcutter Windproof Umbrella,"I purchased two of these umbrellas and am satisfied with them. We got caught in a wind/rainstorm the other day at a soccer game and was very impressed with it's ability to not fold inside out like most of the other peoples umbrellas did. One of the Windcutters poles that hold the outside of the umbrella came undone but it was easily refastened in it's holder and was as good as new. You do need to have a good hold on the umbrella when the wind kicks up as it tends to want to try and fly away until the wind finds its way through the top flaps. The only thing that kept me from giving a full star rating is I was a little disappointed in its overall size. I figured it would be a little larger for a ""Golf"" umbrella but works good for a single persons use."
1,Great umbrella if you can open it!,"This is a great umbrella, but it is almost impossible to open! I came to work this morning and even my boss had trouble getting the button you push to open the umbrella. It closes really easy, I just left it unlatched and wrapped the velcro band around it. Hopefully I won't close it all of the way again! I am editing my previous review, after using the umbrella in a rain storm w/wind, it broke! I almost flew away like Mary Poppins (I certainly entertained the parking lot) One of the flaps off of the top canopy ripped, it wasn't like a hurricane, or even close, just a regular storm with wind. I would send it back, but it would cost as much as the umbrella to return it! I gave it one star because it really is a cool umbrella, just not to be used as advertised!"
1,Khansham Kanhai,This spoke and strut of this umbrella broke after only about 3 uses. Apparently it is not made of the proper strength materials and cross-section area/profile. It looks good and attractive but it is weak.
5,Great Umbrella Great Price,"I've been using this umbrella to commute from my apartment to the office which is a mile away, during that walk I need to pass in front of a golf drive practice field so the wind runs very fast and the umbrella has worked just perfectly, it is large so it covers me without a problem, and the price is excellent comparing to a $40 umbrella that will do the same as this one, fell confident to buy."
3,Can't use it if they don't deliver it right?,"I finally got a good hard rain to test this umbrella and man is it one well built umbrella it held up to gale force winds and lots and lots of heavy rain. I think this umbrella will last me many many years because it is well built. (oh by the way it kept me dry when everyone else got wet) But you should remember that if you buy from Intech, -to keep in mind that you should anticipate that the umbrella will take at least a month and 1/2 or more to get to you. But because of the excellent performance of this umbrella I am raising my rating of it from one star to three stars. Intech still loses two stars for extremely slow delivery.--------------------I order this Intech Windcutter Umbrella on 3/25/10 from amazon and Intech still hasn't shipped it. Amazon has reset the shipping estimate to 5/3/10 - 5/10/10. The original estimate was in the beginning of April by the time intech gets around to it the rainy session will be over."
2,Inferior quality,"First time I used this umbrella, in light rain and a little wind, the stitching pulled loose around one of the spokes. It was a fairly inexpensive umbrella, but it shouldn't start falling apart on the first use. The release button on the shaft also seems to be made of cheap materials and feels flimsy. I guess I'll be buying a new umbrella (again) pretty soon."
2,Decadence,"I am a passionate fan of Johnny Clegg and Savuka Music and I had great expectations about this cd that I bought about 3 years ago. Yet...listening to it turned into a bitter disillusion. Only the song ""Love is just a Dream"" and, maybe, ""Circle of Light"" too are worth 15 minutes of listening. Where is the powerful, mystic, capturing music created by Johnny Clegg and Savuka in the past years that made us dream when we listened and still listen to it in the albums ""Third World Child"", ""Shadowman"", ""Cruel Crazy Beautiful World"", ""Heat Dust and Dreams""? Those were the albums produced by Johnny Clegg and Savuka from 1988 to 1998 that made me fall in love with Johhny! Compared to that music, songs in the album ""Crocodile Love"" are but a pale shadow, a sort of decadence, in the music quality of such a superb Artist, towards ""banal"" and sometimes not even enjoyable rhythms. I hope that next Johny's albums will make us dream and dance as they did before."
5,Wind in the Willows,"I loved this adaptation, and so did the elderly folks I read it to. WONDERFUL ILLUSTRATIONS!"
3,"beware, this is no dvd",i purchase this item from the seller and based upon the description indicates 1 dvd disc. but when you receive the product it's a compact disc with 3 cuba's music. frankly i didn't file a complain neither give a negative review because i put it back on sale but indicating that's it is a 3 compact disc and it was sold. but just beware this item is no dvd.
5,mermaidvw,"I love this guy! Have sent him to several friends and relatives as a gift, and he has delighted them as well. His friend the snail also graces my garden."
2,Orbit 91130,"I bought this gauge to measure my home water pressure in order to set the pressure in an expansion tank. It initially read 29 psi. I increased the PRV until the gauge read 48 psi. Then I took a shower; the massage setting really worked well. Being suspicious, I bought another gauge. The new gauge read 60 psi. Then I checked both gauges against an air pressure gauge on my air system. The second Orbit was within 1 psi of the air gauge. The original was 12 psi lower. Which do I trust; the air gauge, or one or another of the Orbits?"
1,didnt work,I bought this when i got the xbox because i hated the huge controller. Took it out of the millitary issue plastic wrap and 20 minutes later pluged in in with Halo. It worked for 5 seconds and then shut off. I tried everything like changing the channels on the reciever and controller and it just quit. I do not recomend this.
2,"Decent, not worth the money though","I purchased this for my XBOX a few months ago, and I must say that this controller is unacceptable. Sometimes while I play the joystick won't let me walk backward on Halo. Sometimes it won't move at all on some games. It I could go back in time, I would have bought a Microsoft brand XBOX controller. Don't get me wrong, this controller is worth about ten dollars at the most."
1,Not Compatible with the Nokia 8260,Thanks to the 1st review I purchased this product for my Nokia 8260 phone - only to find out it is not compatible with this model - I should have purchased the M133 model which is compatible. I am sorry I listened to the review - now I have paid for shipping costs and do not have a cellular headset!
2,Broke in just over a month,"The sound quality of the headset was fine for both listening and speaking. The earpiece pivots on the ""ear hook"", which is made of very cheap plastic. The hook broke after just over a month of light to moderate use. Beware."
1,"BAD MIC, UNCOMFORTABLE: I'M RETURNING MINE","After much searching, I thought this headset might be the one. While the mute, volume and mic controls are nice, none of that matters when people can't hear me talk. Forget about trying to use it outside. In addition to having to turn up the volume quite high for the earpiece, the ear-hook piece/attachmet hurts my ear after lengthy use, definitely within an hour. Sigh, back to searching for a better headset..."
3,"Skip this one and buy ""Dying Just To Live"" separately","Lost and Gone was the first release from theMK IIlineup of Masterplan, which (at the time) included Roland Grapow, Mike Terrana and Mike DiMeo. Lost and Gone was a 4-track EP that previewed the MK II album. Here's what you get:1. Master's Voice - This is an instrumental introductory track that's exclusive to this EP. It helps set the mood, but it's not something you need to hear more than once.2. Lost and Gone - This song appears on the MKII album.3. Dying Just to Live - This is an all-new studio song that's exclusive to this EP. It's a fairly laid back song, but it's still really good. DiMeo does a terrific job on this one.4. Keeps Me Burning - This is also on MKII.With only one exclusive song (only one that matters at least), I can't recommend buying this pricey EP. Fortunately ""Dying Just To Live"" is available as a download, so you can get that song individually."
4,NOT Jorn Lande at the helm,"This is a good rock n' roll album and it certainly follows in the footsteps of Lande-fronted metal albums that Masterplan has done in the past. However, DO NOT go into this thinking Jorn Lande is still the front-man for the band. This time Mike DiMeo is singing, and he does a great job, but it's not Jorn. I really enjoyed it anyways, if you like the previous Masterplan stuff, it's worth a listen."
4,For a true Fan its nice to have,"The concert recording is not technically good, but its great to see them all in the early years of the Cars. The interview at the end was a nice addition but I find it difficult to view considering Bens physical decline captured here. The Cars will always be one of my favorite bands. They are just what I needed!"
1,Not Worth the Money,"Is there such thing as no stars? We just picked up this DVD while feeling nostalgic. The music quality was terrible. The songs were ok, but the live performance did nothing for us. The best part was watching Greg Hawkes trying to play all the little gadgets during ""I'm in Touch with your World"". This was a home movie for sure and feel you'd spend your money better on one of a Cars album instead."
2,Disappointing,Many great songs are missing. Not very well done - like a home movie done at small bar.
1,1 of favorite bands of all time but poor poor DVD,I cannot believe every1 else's rating on this. It gets a 1 cuz of who they are fanominal band... I have over 100 dvd's & had to sell this 1 since it DID NOT sound anything like the songs I sang growing up with 6 cd's. Would recommend this to any1. Again 1 of my top 10 bands out of 200 but there performance or sound on this DVD is terrible
3,It's All They Can Do...But It Could Have Been More,"I rented this DVD, and it's not bad, but it could have been better. The live concert sounds kinda grainy - couldn't they have released a show from their later tours like the Heartbeat City tour? The interview gives plenty of insight into a very unique and innovative band. I just wish there was more music. One suggestion - they should re-release their videos for songs like ""Drive"" and ""You Might Think"" and throw in any live performances that they can come up with. Rest In Peace, Ben Orr."
2,The Cars Live Review,"I purchased this live DVD but didn't realize that this DVD was only being sold on every format EXCEPT region 1. On the case it says it's compatible with region 2,3,4,5,6 which is crazy because they might as well made it ALL regions. So basically I couldn't play it on my DVD player. What a waste of money."
4,For the Cars-o-phile,"Seeing The Cars in an early small club setting was priceless.However, since the production quality of this release leaves quite a bit to be desired, I can only recommend it to fans of the band."
1,Waste of money,Who did the production for this? A High School video class? The lighting sucks. The video production sucks. The audio sucks!!! I've done better videos using my Panasonic VCR camera and Nero!! The video has text pop up on the screen with the song name and other things. The audio is WAAAAY over-modulated especially for the keyboards. I tried to watch it 3 times and finally decided to trash it. Was not worth my time OR my money!!!
3,Audio is lacking,"Let me first say, I'm not a huge Cars fan, but I did buy this DVD. The audio is 5.1 only and it doesn't sound that great. Rhino does not provide a stereo mix which automatically removes a star from the rating. Why did they do this? There was no 5.1 in 1978 so why didn't they give us a stereo mix in addition to the 5.1 mix?The video is not that great either. Some of the Musikladen shows filmed years before this (Yes and Roxy Music) look and sound better than this DVD.The band sounds ok, but because all their songs were over-produced, none of the songs sound like they do on the radio. If you want to hear a band play as well or better in concert than they do on record, check out some Yes or Utopia.The extras are the only exceptional features on this DVD. Over 46 minutes of new interviews with the band."
5,Worth it!,To see The Cars in their prime is fab. It is very sad to see what cancer had done to Ben Orr in the interview. A very sad day in Rock. He can NEVER be replaced!
4,"Cars fans, you gotta get this one!","This is a very rare and very old piece of concert footage from The Cars' one and only European tour in 1979. The concert takes place in a small club, showcasing the band at their best. Unfortunately, there is a down side to placing older video footage onto the DVD format. As noted on the package, there are ""technical anomalies inherent in historic footage."" What this translates to is intermittent horizontal lines that appear throughout the duration of the concert. If you can get past that, then it's a great show.Bonus material includes a CD sampler and lengthy interview with the band. The interview, while quite interesting, is somewhat tough to watch as Ben Orr is sadly in the advanced stages of cancer. Still, it's great to see the entire group reassembled after all this time for a really entertaining discussion of the band, their history, and their music. A thoroughly enjoyable DVD for a very reasonable price. A must have for all fans!"
5,the cars live musikladen,"I am a huge cars fan until they jumped the shark and went commercial in the early 80's. the early stuff is unparalled and i was very happy to get a live dvd of the early days. condition was excellent, arrived on time, woul order from again anytime."
2,"Historical, but not high quality...","The bands performance is typical of their music, but the quality of their performance and the era of the recording equipemnt do not make this a quality show. Pretty average in comparison of the many videos I have already collected. That being said, because it is historical and a snapshot of the band, it is worth a viewing or two...buy the used version to save a few bucks."
4,Worth the purchase.....,"I had been contemplating buying this DVD for some time & after purchasing it here at amazon, I'm glad I did. Honestly, I thought the sound quality could be better, but it's really not bad. It appears that they did this show right at the time they released their 2nd album (candy-o) in June 1979. It would have been nice if they did more tracks from their candy-o album, but I'd still recommend this DVD to any cars fan."
2,glue dries orange,from the standpoint of strength it has been great. I dries in 30 seconds to the point that further clamping can be done. The huge drawback is that on my wooden cars and trucks the glue residue dries a bright orange. It is hard to get our of the small cracks. I much prefer Titebond because it dries a very pale tan color.
5,Who cares about the color?,"Yes, it dries orange. But you cannot stain glue and anyone making high quality wood products will remove all glue before staining or oiling by planing or sanding. That said, I have actually run experiments with Probond. I have glued pieces together and then broke them with hammers. None of the pieces ever break along the glue. The glue is actually STONGER than the wood. I have some Titebond but have never used it because I have been so happy with the Probond. I guess if your application is color sensitive you might not want to use this. I have used it for both interior and exterior use and been thrilled."
3,Good Ol' Fashioned Wood Glue,This glue works quite well and I dont really have any complaints about the glue itself other than it dries quite yellow.However there are superior products when it comes to the container out there. Elmers is a good product however the hard plastic tip makes cleaning off old dry glue more difficult than others that have soft rubber tips.Still this is a good product.
3,Watery and dries orange,"As another reviewer has stated, the glue appears to hold very well and dries a bright orange. My largest problem with the glue is it is extremely watery. The glue application needs to be on a level surface or you will have orange glue on all surfaces of your project as gravity pulls it down. Think the old school glue, only about 50% more watery."
2,"Nice looks, poor design","I just received this phone and found that the caller ID is unreadable unless it faces you squarely...ok if mounted on a wall, but no good on the desktop. See the product picture? At that angle, all the LCD segments appear black. Phone also picks up severe hum at various locations in my house. Very disappointing."
1,Faulty Design,"This phone doesn't works properly, the audio level when speaking on the phone (i.e. the level that the caller hears) is much too low. I guess the amplifier design is faulty as you can hear the noise level increase at it vainly tires to compensate. I brought two models back to the shop for a refund. It is disapointing at it is the only phone I can find that has the all features I want."
1,DON'T BUY WHAT YOU CAN GET FOR FREE!! BEWARE!!,"BOSE offers replacement buds for free on their website. don't pay for them here when you can get a complimentary pack that includes 1 small, 1 medium, 1 large replacement. i almost made the mistake of buying them until i saw a review here that directed me to the appropriate place. these headphones are more of a hassle than i'm willing to admit to because i spent so much money on them. GL!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"Even if they dont give out complimentary tips on website anymore, call them at customer service and they will send it to you free of charge. DO NOT SPEND A PENNY FOR THE TIPS!!"
5,They worked,They worked. Nothing else to add so I am just filling space this time because you have to for reviews.
4,"the cop, the magician, and the brothel","in this film, Vincent Price plays a magician named Felix Manderville who uses his magic act as a cover for his side-job: abducting women and taking them to a brothel. the men who frequent the place in Tangiers get little dolls as tokens, sort of like a free pass to enter. a cop's friend turns up dead and he's on the lookout for anything strange. Manderville is actually harmless, his wife and the head of the brothel are the ones to be on the lookout for! scantily clad women abound in this drive-in flick. an x-rated version was ALSO filmed at the same time {different castmembers of course!}. i give the film 4 stars because i didn't like the attitude of the cop from America who seemed to think he owned the country simply because he was a cop. Vincent is great throughout. one of the memorable scenes is the mud-fights between the local women."
3,Short Changed,"The movie itself is an excellent movie if you are keen on this genre of movie.My main complaint is with the VHS version which omits some of the original movie. Having seen a more complete version on TV this is a big disappointment.One of my favourite scenes is a victim of this cut.Although I would recommend the movie, I would not recommend purchase of the VHS product. Hopefully, a full version release on DVD may one day occur."
3,This film is a weird one....,"Vincent Price plays a hypnotist/ nightclub magician in this fairly odd campy film. Price is hired by some very rich and powerful white slave traders that wan't young, beautiful white women to be hypnotized so they can then work as slaves at the house of 1000 dolls. There is also a vacationing couple that do the detective work in the movie by tracking down one of their friends missing girlfriends that was kidnapped by the slavers. I feel that Vicent Price does a good job, but he's kinda outta place in this one."
2,boo,"I bought this movie because I like Vincent Price. This is not a Vincent Price movie, it is a movie that Vincent Price is in, when we are lucky. He is not the star. His scenes are few & far between. I finally stopped watching it because it is really dump & I got tired of waiting to see Mr. Price."
2,MARISOL IS NOT IN THIS MOVIE!,"MARISOL (PEPA FLORES) IS NOT IN THIS VIDEO! I AM A FAN OF PEPA; WHEN I SAW THE MOVIE IN YOUR DATABASE AS ONE SHE PARTICIPATED OF, I BOUGHT THE VIDEO TO FIND OUT HOW IN THE WORLD SHE COULD BE IN IT. SHE IS A STAR. WELL,I SAW THE WHOLE MOVIE, BUT MARISOL WAS NOT THERE. AT THE END OF THE VIDEO I SAW THE NAME ""MARISOL"" WITH AN UNKNOWN LAST NAME. THIS IS A HORRIBLE MISTAKE AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
5,The poetic narrative of an African-American family,"Rita Dove's book ""Thomas and Beulah"" won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for poetry. I recently re-read the book (more than a decade after having first read it!) and I continue to be impressed by its artistry and quiet compassion. In a series of poems, this book tells the story of an African-American family in the 20th century.The book ends with a chronology that serves as a sort of ""skeleton"" for the story told in Dove's gentle free verse. Thomas and Beulah are an African-American couple who live in Akron, Ohio. They are ordinary people going through the daily trials and joys of life. From their lives Dove creates a low-key epic made up of intimate moments and flashes of insight. We accompany Thomas and Beulah through the World War II era; we see them raise a family; we see the evolution of African-American cultural identity. This is a rewarding book that, in my opinion, secures Dove's place as an essential 20th century American poet."
2,Not Enough,"I like Kurt Carr's style of gospel music, however, I spent 20 dollars on that video, and got nine songs. There are about 15 songs on the cd. Its a good album, but the video is not worth all the money."
2,okay.. sparse though.,"The new edition of the book (available online at crashandsurvive.com) is okay, but I'm not certain it's worth the price tag. The book is thin, and all the content is basically a PowerPoint presentation with notes. Heck, the last 20 pages or so aren't really related at all -- they're another PowerPoint on stress. (and advice like eat right, sleep enough, stay away from extra caffeine.. all stuff you already know)I would REALLY like to see an expanded version of this book that adds in more case studies, photos of crash sites.. just more detail all around. It's obvious from the text that the author has seen enough crashes to offer some good advice -- it's just that there isn't nearly enough info here (and hardly any ""and this is why..."") to justify the price tag."
3,I was expecting better,"I know Mick and he is a great guy with a great deal of experience and knowledge so I was kind of let down when I saw how little ""meat"" there is to this book. More illustrations and straightforward organization would have helped. Unfortunately this book was like an FAA briefing. Mick did not do enough to make this interesting subject more useful to me."
1,Worst possible product,"It doesn't get much worse than this. I wish the product would have not worked at all. Then at least I would have returned it. The phone works OK, but only after a while did we find out that the answering machine is only storing about 30 seconds of voice, before it states, Memory Full..."
2,Tinny sound quality and static,"I purchased this phone with high expectations and was disappointed by the tinny sound quality of both recorded and incoming messages. But the main problem is the HUGE amount of static on incoming messages. I've tried this phone in other outlets and other locations and it seems to be a problem within the phone. Needless to say, it's going back to the store ASAP."
2,machine frozen,"I purchased this product in January of this year, and was pretty pleased with it at first, except for the quality of the digital voice. However, recently, after a severe electrical storm, the machine keeps saying ""memory full"", even though I have deleted all messages. I followed the recorded instructions I received when I called the customer service number, but nothing has worked. I'm ready to retun it, and purchase a completely different machine."
4,speakerphone review,I like the phone very much. The only thing is the voice is very weak and garbled that tells you if you have messages.
2,Answerer quit working,"We have had this item for less than a year. The answerer stopped working. Trouble shooting tips says, ""Unplug power cord from the outlet and plug it back in"". Simply, that doesn't correct the problem. Calling the 1-800 number does not give satisfactory information. It gives you a regular phone number to call for additonal help. That could be expensive. Over all, without usable trouble shooting advice, it's unsatisfactory."
1,Where's the speakerphone,"When I purchased the 29893GE1 speakerphone I was impressed with all the features. Everything worked good, my wife liked our old AT&T., speakerphone more because the speaker had a clearer sound. After about a week the speakerphone volume would grow faint while we we're talking to someone. We were unable to adjust the volume and the trouble shooting guide offered no help. So, we are returning the unit and we will try the AT&T957."
1,Don't do it!,"This was the worst purchase I ever made! Although the phone had all the features that I was looking for, the caller id feature only works when it wants it. I thought I had a defective product so I exchanged it, only to find the next one did the same thing. Don't waste your money!"
2,am radio comes in loud and clear,"I have always had a GE phone and appreciated the quality and ease of use. This one has everything I wanted...digital answering machine, call waiting caller id, corded...and the am radio reception I didn't want. I can hear the local traffic and weather as well as the person on the other end. I exchanged it for the same brand thinking I had gotten a lemon...no luck. This one is exactly the same. So, it's back to searching for me. A few reviews mention the SW Bell, so I will try to locate one of those. Too bad GE lost a loyal customer:-("
1,SHOULD BE NO STARS!,"This thing Blows! I bought it thinking it would be an inexpensive answerer.Only problem is, it DOES NOT ANSWER THE CALLS!I returned it and got another, and the new one DID NOT ANSWER THE CALLS EITHER!Lets review; Someone calls--------it DOES NOT ANSWER!This phone BLOWS!"
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this phone about 4 months ago. It seems to have a mind of its own. It randomly does not record messages or caller ID. This happens at least once a day, but up to 3 times a day depending on call volume. It it weren't for my wall phone which also has caller ID, I would have no idea these people called.I have sat next to the machine and listened to an incoming message and noted that the machine did not list it on the caller ID and did not have any history/recording of the call. It also randomly cuts people off about 30 seconds into their message. Other times it records a 2 minute message just fine. Very undependable. It also does not list incoming calls from the day in any kind of order. I will press the key to go through the calls from the day and get several calls dated from a day or two earlier mixed in with the current days calls.Would not recommend purchasing this model."
3,Nice features but. . .,"If you decide not to pay for caller ID, you have to reset the clock et al every time there is an electric outage. The display would have been a lot better if lit. As is, you can only read it in perfect light and at the perfect angle."
5,This is a great book!,"This ia great book becuase the character Torak is on his own. Torak also finds a den and a wolf pack, but Torak see's two adult wolves dead and two cubs dead. Then torak see's one cub alive and takes the cub with him to the forset.This book was exciting so now IO am reading the second book which is called Spirit Walker."
2,2 and a half star for a very average book,"This book wasn't horrible in any way. It had enough good parts to keep me reading the whole series and enjoy it. If you're just looking for a very fast-paced adventure story with a slight touch of horror this might be for you. I liked the stone-age environment and the survival themes. The magic in this book is different from that in other book, which is a good thing as well. Less magic and more like some kind of superstition. If it had been possible I would have given this book 2,5 stars. It is a very average book. Except for the things mentioned I didn't really find much new in it. The characters aren't very interesting nor very original for children's books. The end of most books in the series is also rather disappointing. The main characters defeat the bad ones mostly thanks to luck and coincidences.Don't expect too much of this book but, as I said, it might still be worth reading."
5,Wolf Brother,"The book Wolf Brother by Paver is a great book about a boy named Torak, and his companions Wolf and Renn. Being lost without his father guiding hand, Torak has to find out how to vanquish the demon that killed his father's. I think that this book is very good and it is a really adventurous that will keep you on your toes. The dramatic event in this book is also a great quality to keep you interested, and I think you will enjoy it for that reason also. The book Wolf Brother is one of the best books I have read by far. People that like the book Hatchet will love Wolf Brother."
2,Very overhyped and stereotypical,"The last thing I ever wanted to do was give my child something from the blackface minstrel show/stage Oirish/Me Tonto school of bad Hollywood racial and cultural stereotypes. I had no idea that's what I would find in this much-hyped book, apparently the beginning of a series. I found the writing painful in its lack of depth and insight, which I suppose comes from the author's disconnect from the understanding of a real culture that may have prehistoric roots which could have informed her fantasy culture. While the story is not utterly awful, it does have a lot of 'oh, come ON!' moments. My daughter and her friends, all voracious readers in a mixed gender book club, roundly disliked this book and said they would not read any sequel. Some of them didn't even finish it.In short, I think this was much anticipated and not worth the wait."
4,Very Pleased,"I recently purchased this book for my 10 year old son, he hasen't read it yet but I have. I think the book was very detailed and interesting, it kept me from wanting to put it down, to see what would happen next. All the people with the bad reviews must keep in mind, this book was written for children, so if it wasen't intellectual enough for them, to bad, it wasen't supposed to be. And as for being realistic, who cares, everything doesn't have to be ""true"" to be tantalizing to young minds. In closing I would recommend this book to any child and I know my son will enjoy it just as much as I did."
4,A good quick read,"I found this to be an enjoyable, quick read. The wolf was very real & I enjoyed the interaction between him and the main character."
5,Clan of the Cave Bear for Kids!,"An excellent action and adventure book. Start now and begin your journey back in time. Back to the days of the clans. How do you survive in the great wilderness? Remember, all you have are your wits, a small wolf cub and the memories passed down by your father. Are you ready to fight the great beast that is not of this world? Will you win?"
3,Wolf brother,A fairly decent book. Recommend that you buy. It includes action emotion comedy and lots more. Its what it says on the cover.
3,Only for beginners and then quickly outgrown,"This is a workout that is really aimed for beginners. It will teach the moves because the pace is very very slow. If you are new to working out and have never done any karate or kickboxing style workouts, this will be a good choice to use to learn the moves. You will age out of it really quick so try to pick this up cheaply."
2,Blah-ish,"Reading ""Bluish,"" I kept feeling as though I was reading a bizarre abridgement - all the extraneous portions of a novel, with the actual plot and most of the character development removed. This is supposed to be a great novel about a developing friendship, but there's no explanation given for Dreenie's progression from a detached fascination with Bluish, to an active horror of her, to suddenly being best buddies. Bluish is the ""ailing friend"" stock character, passive and dull, with no personality or depth beyond her illness. And are we really supposed to believe that a girl with cancer could come to school for several weeks, or even months, before the teacher decides to go to the trouble of explaining the disease to the class and answering their questions?Unless you like unsympathetic characters, unrealistic conversations, and an undeveloped plot, steer clear of this one."
2,Too confusing in tone and message to really enjoy,"I'm sure this author's heart was open when she wrote this book, but I found the constant jumps in perspective and points of view jarring, and the theme muddied by a wish to try to do too much in a brief tome. There are some absolutely stirring passages that get lost amidst the thematic clutter."
2,Couldn't connect with the characters,"I was really looking forward to reading this novel after having met and heard speeches from Virginia Hamilton at both NCTE and IRA National conventions. I have to say I was disappointed. I couldn't connect to the characters and even had trouble telling their voices apart. I'm sure book will do well based on her reputation as an author, but I was not impressed. Not enough development of story to use with my students."
2,Bluish-06,"Bluish, is unknown to everyone. She sits alone in a corner like a ghost and watches. Everyone is scared of her because the her skin has a bluish tint. But Dreenie the most unlikely of all decides to befriend Bluish. At first when she tries to talk to bluish it doesn't work. But later on Bluish and dreenie form a strong, unlikely friendship. It turns out Bluish is blue because she has cancer and chemo tainted her skin. That's also why she has no hair only hats. And why she isn't at school much. Bluish gets sick a lot. Bluish finds her real name is Natalie. And through a rough series of events Dreenie brings bluish the most wonderful gift ever. Hope.This story has potential but it is confusing. It jumps around a lot and makes it hard for the reader to understand. However the storyline and the moral are equally beautiful. I recommend this book to anyone 12 and up."
4,Hamilton leaves me hopeful!,"Sometimes children can be unknowingly mean and brutal. Virginia Hamilton's characters seem real and natural. And how real and natural for children to tease and fear what they do not know. Hamilton's characters move smoothly from at first being fearful of Bluish to knowing her, understanding her illness, and becoming protective. Although not too many unexpected twists and turns, Bluish quickly draws you into a group of very likeable characters. ""Girlfren'"" Tuli is a hoot. Excellent reading for 5th or 6th grade."
5,Shadow Zone: The Undead Express,This is an awesome movie. this is a pretty good movie. i liked the story and the vampires were pretty cool. i liked how they did the make up effects and the special effects were pretty good to. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
1,Natanya Ross is in it,"Honestly, the only reason I bought this was to complete my collection of the works of Natanya Ross. Ms. Ross is a wonderful young actress."
4,Not Exactly Sure Why.....,This is the book you want to read if you want to hear about all of the blacks early adventures right up to the point when The Black boards The Drake. Great for adventure lovers and all who want to know the whole story. Yet something about it doesn't appeal to me maybe its because theres no Alec. You can judge fthis book yourself but I'd definetly try it.
4,Good read!,"Interesting and fun to read, says my twelve year old. At times she was confused, apparently because of references to other books, but in the end it all makes sense."
4,decent,"This book is definitly not as good as the Black Stallion but it is decent. Some parts get kind of exciting and a good portion of the book keeps you guessing even though sometimes it seems like Farley let a chapter get boring. Anyways though, it puts everything together between the Black Stallion and the Young Black Stallion and it's also nice because it gives you a little taste of a different culture"
4,A wonderful book for adventurous readers and people,"It's a wonderful book for people who like adventurous stories, very well written in my point of view. Yet it still had a few bad parts here and there. You should defently buy!"
2,Go solo,"Three's Company - Season OneThree's Company - Season TwoDon't get me wrong, the show is great and earns a five-star rating, it's the offer that is misleading. Hopefully giving it two stars will get fellow buyers to read further.Instead of dishing out $ 35 for season 2 and fall for the gimmick of getting season 1 for free, go for individual dvds and pay $ 6 for season 1, then set yourself back another $ 14 for season 2.Additional shipping cost per dvd will not cost you $15 (that is the price difference).The price reviews for the above dvds are done at the same time (during the time this review is posted) - hopefully amazon will review its pricing and consumer exercise awareness on similar offers."
2,"A couple of good cuts, most is not worth the time","I would take the other (5 star) review on this item with more than a grain of salt. I wonder if that reviewer has a financial interest in the sales of this disc.To rant on about how wonderful everything is on the disc, with nonsense like ""The Who rock out"" is clearly a shill. The Who are lip syncing to Magic Bus on this DVD.Nuff said. A few interesting tracks. JW is live and stellar with Johnny B. Goode.But definitely a grab bag, not a classic."
4,magnetic copper bracelet,bracelet needs to be bent to open and tighten otherwise it would be 5 out of 5 stars
5,Copper that not only looks good but really works,I recently bought this bracelet to help with a back problem. It was said that it could help the healing of muscle strain and so forth. It has helped a great deal and it also looks good. I highly recommend this product.
5,Blues with a twist!,"I was unsure what to expect from the former Slick Pelt Guitarist. This certainly exceeds my expectations. This is Blues with a little Rock and a little Roll. Strong Vocals and stunning guitar playing. There is a great choice of cover versions on this album such as 29 Ways and Walking the Dog. However it is Michael Louis' own compostions that really shine. 'What Comes Around', 'Again' and the stunning 'The Roll Up' really shine. Backed up by a great rhythm section, this album smokes. If you only purchase one album by an unknown guitarist with bags of talent this year, make it this one. You will not be disappointed."
5,A gorgeous book,"While I was reading this book, I couldn't wait to get home from work so I could fall back into the stories. Now I'm walking around with the characters in my head, like old friends. It's a beautiful book, the kind you want to recommend to everyone you know. Ryan Harty is a wonderful writer."
2,Not a Winner,"This popcorn came with the butter all leaking out along the sides of the bucket. It has almost no butter flavor when popped, possibly because it all leaked out. Duh! Not recommended."
4,"Inconsistent, wrong examples - Pay Attention!","I bought this book not knowing a lick of Win32 API programming, so I had to take a crash course in Win32 programming first, as the book starts off assuming you know the API. Thankfully, it leaves MFC and ATL to the last chapter and focuses solely on C and the API.One problem I had with the book is that the examples in the text are often quite wrong in terms of number/use of parameters, and leave out some details that can be misleading. Besides the examples, the text has frequent misleading information (p.44: ""First you can call the CommandBar_InsertButton() function..."" Later on the same page: ""The other function you can use to add buttons is the CommandBar_InsertButton() function..."" - the first quote should have said CommandBar_AddButton())If you are paying attention and following the book closely, you will weed out these inconsistencies, though, and should come out of it with respectable knowledge of CE."
4,Powerful book which delivers on its promise,"The book somewhat delivered on its promise back when it was still called WinCE (I'm pretty sure this book won't work for post 2.0 WinCE versions). Unfortunately, at the time I had to fork out $1k for a development platform which would allow me to compile some code for my WinCE machines. This is ridiculous. Why should I pay for the privilage of developing on Microsoft's platform? In the end, I came to the conclusion that Windows CE itself is pretty worthless. Too many drawbacks, and there isn't much point in it with out a better UI stuck on it. Presumably later versions have found a niche as background OS for PalmOS, and for fancy cell phones."
5,More than I'd expected,"After reading Path of Fate, I half expected Path of Honor to follow along the same lines... a good, fast read, but relatively light in mood. Was I wrong. This book is considerably darker with a lot of fascinating political intrigue. Francis is a master of the natural world and her skill in ""court"" is equally involving. Some of the names and titles are a bit confusing at first, but once you get into the book, it gets easier. I'd love for her publishers to include some extra world info in the back... I want to know more about Kodu Riik, Patverseme and this newly introduced land, Scallas. Overall a good read. I recommend this book to any fan of fantasy."
5,A pleasing followup!,"After reading ""Path of Fate,"" this book answered my need for more of Resil. I loved this book as much as I loved the first one.The continuation of the characters and their growth was exciting. The information about the sorcerers and Resil's struggle with evil was exciting! I would read this book again even if the author decided to put more information in it to make the pages twice as long. Usually the quality of detail is only necessary but it takes a GREAT author to write a both qualitative and quantitative, exciting novel.Each book is different but it all ties together to form a wonderfully written trilogy.This is a true Science Fiction/Fantasy novel and a series that I will re-read again."
4,Better than the first,"This one progressed well from the first and the sinister side of political intrigue reared it's ugly head. She has several unpleasant choices ahead of her and ultimately works it out. Great read and a good plot.**A book I would also recommend is The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. This, the first installment of The Morcyth Saga is a great beginning for a new author. Battles, magic, gods, secret passages and intrigue, all the elements of a classic epic fantasy! Any fantasy reader will enjoy it"
2,would be perfect if it only worked,"I really like this phone, the way it looks, and the fact it has an extention cordless phone with it that only requires an AC outlet. And it's so cheap! However, it doesn't work. The ringer doesn't ring and you can't play your messages. What bothers me the most is that the seller won't respond to my requests to return it. Bad business. I won't ever buy from him again!"
4,Excellent,"First of all this phone comes from a well renouned company, G.E. Secondly this phone has the feature that i havent seen in any other phone and that is the cordless handset and the base set with the corded handset. This allows you to hear and talk without disturbing others from the base set as well as handset also. The base has also dialpad for dialing from the base.Moreover it has all other features like, call waiting, cli, hold, intercom e.t.c (See technical details for more).And the price is well less then those other sets that are only handsets or are with a base that dosent have base pad for dialing."
2,OK Phone,"I wish I could find another phone like this by another manufacturer. It's an OK phone, but the little things are really beginning to bug me (after 4 months): can't read main display at night (backlight only comes on when phone is in use or phone is ringing); cordless charge doesn't last very long (a couple of days off the charger, without a lot of use, and it needs to be reacharged again); answering machine doesn't play the announcement so you can hear whether or not the announcement is working (also, other answering machines we've had stop the announcement if the caller hangs up); no good way to just view the caller-id's of the ""new"" calls; no way to delete ""old"" caller-id calls. Phone works fine, just the little things really beginning to bother me."
1,I'm SHOCKED by this awful telephone.,"This phone does not have the option of only playing new messages. Either remotely or at the base station. You've got to listen to or skip each one individually.There is a virtually unnoticeable ""message waiting"" light on both the handset and the base. It is miniscule and it doesn't blink.It takes a few seconds for the dial tone to appear on the handset.The phone will only answer your remote code when you've finished listening to your outgoing message, which is incredibly annoying. But not as annoying as the fact that it plays your outgoing message REALLY LOUD when the machine picks up at the base. Why does it play your message at all? And then, if someone leaves a message, you can't hear him/her AT ALL. The sound is practically nil at home or from a remote location.I would have liked this machine very much in the 1970s, but come on GE, the technology has advanced just a tad since then.I'm taking mine back today."
2,Lack of support for GE phone,"I have had this phone for less than a year and the remote unit stopped working. I replaced the batteries several times with no results. I tried to call the numbers listed in the User's Guide and found I will have to send the whole thing back to get it repaired, plus I could not talk to a technical person to see if there was another repair option.I would never buy a GE phone again."
1,Unreliable - poor quality,"(This review applies to the JVC 30-disc DVD-R spindle, Taiwan, 4.7GB, model no. VD-R47 GU 30, Version 2.1/16x)These JVC discs are manufactured in Taiwan and are of very poor quality. No fewer than twelve of the thirty discs ended up in my recycle bin because they were unusable, so my net cost per disc was no bargain at all. After going through this 30-count spindle very quickly due to the many duds, I drove to my local retailer and bought a 50-count spindle of Sony DVD-R discs (manufactured in Malaysia) for $19. The contrast couldn't be more dramatic: The Sony discs have burned error-free thus far. This JVC 30-ct spindle may seem like a good deal at first, but you're going to end up with many, many coasters. Buyers beware."
1,battery life is a joke,"I don't think the battery can last beyond a day. My AT&T phone can last up to a week. Other than the unsatisfactory battery life, the phone is fine."
3,Poor Battery Life,"Phone works as advertised. Unfortunately, I don't think the battery life was included in their advertising.- Average sound quality- Difficult to call people back from the phone's call history- Battery life way below my expectations- If the phone dies while you're talking on it, it doesn't automatically hang up. You have to hang the phone up and wait for the phone to grab enough charge to hang up before you can continue the phone conversation even if you've picked up the line on another phone (massive amounts of static).My phone will not last through the day if it wasn't charged the night before. But for the money, I'm satisfied."
1,Kensington 120 watt DC Notebook Power Supply for Laptops,This was a bad buy.The 120-watt supply does not provide adequate power to charge and run a Toshiba Satellite 1955 laptop from the 12-volt power outlet in the car.The laptop is rated at 90 watts.I contacted Kensington and they said they would send me a different connector.They did send a different connector and it did not work any better than the first one I used.I told them the new connector did not work. They told me that they did not have a connector for my computer and that was that.Communicating with Kensington by email in an attempt to fix this problem took over a month.They do not do refunds.
1,Pathetic availability of SmartTips,"Before buying one of these make sure Kensington makes a tip for your device, they still don't have one for the IBM Thinkpad T60, or a properly working one for the Motorola RAZR - and how long have they both been available!!!"
1,MTX HTS-28W,"Bad subwoofer, I hardly hear the bass from it,need to sit really close in order to hear the bass. Customer support isn't so helpful and the seller doesn't accept a return. All and all it's bad."
3,A Nice Book,"This book, albeit it small, was big in content. Lots of very nice pictures, as well as prose and poetry. A very nice gift for the bride-to-be."
1,I bought the wrong thing,It was in perfect condition but did not fit into my gameboy sp so i could not trade with my friend.
3,a descent into hell,Argentina's 1976-82 period must rate as one of the more horrible episodes of our dark century. The book gives short descriptions of what particular people went through although the combination of multiple authors and a committee production ultimately makes it read like a bureaaucratic document. What a book like this really needs is a focused narrative into the horrible stories of a few individuals with all the statistical stuff condensed into a few charts at the end. That way it would have more punch and be more interesting to read. An admirable attempt to understand some of the inhuman practices of the military repression which hopefully some other writer can expand on in the future.
1,A biased report of what really happened,"The book is nothing more than a biased report of what really happened in Argentina during the period 1976-1983. The best example of this is that the real number of ""desaparecidos"" was not 30,000 but 7,000. If you are going to write a serious report at least try to be accurate..."
4,Really good unit,"Okay, it's expensive, but in 20-30 minutes you can make a really nice gelato or sorbet. It doesn't spin fast enough to be an ice cream maker, but this also means you get a richer, denser product. If you're like me, you'll appreciate not having so much of the volume being air.The bowl does not come out which makes cleanup a little difficult, and the dasher does not have a silicone edge. The upside is that you don't get tiny pieces of silicone in your product (what do you think is happening when it wears out?), but the downside is that you should use the spatula to scrape the bowl at least once before you finish with the automation.I've been using this unit for months though with fantastic result. Vanilla Grand Marnier Sorbet, Rum Raisin and Baily's Gelatos, all come out beautifully. I mention these in particular because I did not skimp on the alcohol, and it still froze just fine. If you can afford it, I highly recommend one."
3,"I give an ""E"" for effort","This film was ambitious but ends up short of expectations. This is an ultra low budget slasher so keep that in mind while watching. There isn't anything in this film that hasn't been done bigger and better by someone else. I do have to give cool points for some of the kills, torture, and use of blood. All stereotypical teenagers are represented, and like most horror films in this category, some are annoying more than others and I gladly welcomed their demise. This is a worthy effort and I look forward to seeing more from the production team to see if they will make em bigger and better."
5,"A wonderful romp thru blood, guts, and gore galore!","I saw this bloody little flick at the New York City Horror Film Festival. It played once (I believe) to a completely packed theater with standing room only. From the first scene all the way to the last, I was amazed with how well it looked and how gory it was. Interesting story, pretty good actors (with a few stand out actors who blew me away with their performances), lots and lots of gore and torture (and if I remember correctly, some tatas!). I ordered my copy as soon as I saw it was coming out!"
5,Very helpful,So simple but so effective. I had both my hips replaced and used this product everyday. It is great. I wish I would of thought of it. :-)
3,Sock Dressing Aid,It worked great until the terrycloth covering started to fall apart that is on one side of the device. Fix that problem and this is a good product. Just needs something done about the type of cloth used.
3,Orbit irrigation riser,"Can't give a real review since I haven't used it yet. However, it looks like it will do the job for which it was intended."
2,"Toshiba 50"" HDTV",I purchased this TV from Best Buy...mistake number one. It broke after only 2 years. The quality of the picture is nice and clear. But I would not recommend the purchase of this TV.
3,poor shipping and delivery,"ordering was easy, but to get the product is a hassle. Eagle delivery did a very poor job. They deliver only on week days between 9am and 5pm. Very inconvenient and uncooperative. I donot recommend to any one who works during week days."
2,disappointed,"Although the written information in this book is pretty informative, especially about the company and it's history, I was disappointed that all the pictures in the book are in black & white and it is difficult to find specific pieces (owned) to see what they may be worth or what particular pattern they are. There is no definative catalog of glassware as I have found in various other books about depression glass and Jadite products. This book will probably stay on my bookshelf."
3,Heisey Glass Identification and Value Guide,"Difficult book to read, but the best of all the books I've found on Heisey glass. There is so much to learn about the beautiful glass."
2,Not Great,"If you are very near your wireless hub, you will likely be fine. I'd say 20 feet max and no walls or such to obscure the signal. Any more than that, buy a wireless N capable device. I ended up doing that."
2,No more Belkin for me!,"I purchased this item over a year ago and had good results while using Microsoft Vista, but as soon as I upgraded to Windows 7 I was left with a plastic piece of junk since Belkin does not have updated drivers for this network adapter. Their customer support wasn't any help. I will be staying away from Belkin from here on out!"
4,pretty good,"this product was very good for the price, 0 issues with it so far, have been using for 2 months now"
4,"No issues, XP & Win7 compatable",Availalbe Vista drivers will work for Win7. Slim usb plug for included optional stand doesn't hog up nearby usb ports. Can plug directly into usb port without the stand but may block other open usb ports. Functions properly. Good value.
4,Does what I need,"Purchased this to connect to a Belkin F5D9230 wireless router. I have this adapter connected to an XP machine and my router in connected to a cable modem. I was able to get connect almost immediately using the Belkin wireless software, however, I did not want to run their software, I wanted to use the built-in Windows wireless drivers and had issues connecting this adapter to my wireless router. I contacted the techinal support (which was very helpful, to my suprise). It turns out that you cannot use 128-bit WEP security mode with Windows and this adapter (which I would like to use so that I can connect my work PC to my network), but it does work fine using WPA security mode (which is actually more secure). It is now running fine and seems to be very quick."
3,32 bit capable only,It works in XP and on a Mac. Unfortunately there is no support for Vista 64-bit. This probably includes XP 64 as well. The device is not recognized.
1,It doesn't work with Windows 7,"This product doesn't have a driver for Windows 7, so if you are runnning Windows7, this is not the product for you."
3,Gets the job done but is cumbersome,"Although the network adapter works great, it is quite large.The wireless capability broke on my laptop and I got this as a workaround since the computer manufacterur wanted to wipe my laptop and take two weeks to do so as a ""potential"" fix.The actual wireless adapter is 3 1/2 inches long (not including the USB connector) and 1 3/4 inches wide.With that size, it sticks out of my laptop quite far and the metal USB connector has become bent so that the adapter doesn't stay in very well.I now have to use the adapter with mini docking station. I guess the good thing is that I can sit the adapter with the docking station further away from me (if the proximity to the radio waves causes cancer, it's a plus to keep it away - otherwise, it's just not convenient.)It does its job well as far as connectivity, but if you're purchasing this for a laptop that you take around with you quite a bit, you might want to look for a smaller adapter."
5,works on older computers with usb 1.0,"Fast and easy plug and play setup. Works great and online in less than 5 min. Great choice for older computers / laptops with USB 1.0 or 1.1 (also works with USB 2.0) if you want WAP2 security. (Most others that work with USB 1.* ports will not work with advanced security, like WPA2). This one works great, allowing an older laptop to network with newer computers using WPA2 security."
3,Find a spot and leave it there,"I bought this as a cheaper alternative to replacing my internal Wi-Fi card on my laptop after it crapped out.As a whole it pretty much does what it says except after about 100 feet the signal is about half as strong as fifty feet and so on and not the 1000 ft it advertised. For the best reception I need to make sure it faces the general direction of my router.I also picked this one because of its wired extension to keep the actual unit from sticking out of the side of the laptop and risk snapping it as the USB design and placement on my laptop doesn't seem well thought out, but what I didn't think about is when I move the laptop it was just another wire to tangle (solved that with some Velcro and a rubber band).Overall I wouldn't suggest this one for traveling laptops but I would recommend it for systems that always sit in the same spot."
3,"Mac users, be aware!","First of all, there was NO Macintosh software included with this product, even though the manual showed a Mac-compatible symbol. I had to download the so-called software from the Belkin website, but found out that the software for OS 10.4 was buggy at best. Everything works fine if you connect the product AFTER you boot up or reset your computer. Out of frustration, I downloaded the software for OS 10.3 and it worked as advertised! Belkin needs to either include the correct software on the install CD with the product, or at least indicate that Mac users need to download the software from their website."
5,It had satisfied my spectations,"It was a gift for my brother, and he was abble to install, so , thts why i said it is easy to install and use."
4,Easy to install and does the job!,"I installed this adapter in a corner bedroom in my house where I previously couldn't even pick up my signal from my wireless network. This adapter did pick it up, but it's still pretty low. I do think this adapter works really well, but my router is in a bad place and unfortunately it can't be moved. I'm glad that I am now able to receive a connection thanks to this adapter!The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it installs the ""Belkin Wireless Client Utility"" to manage your wireless connection and run every time you start Windows. I disabled this but still it is an inconvenience."
2,Far from ideal,"I got this to give an old (2002) G4 iMac wireless capabilities, and getting it set up wasn't too difficult. The problem is that it doesn't stay connected consistently. Anytime the computer is shut down or anything, we've had to go through the entire set-up process again, and it often requires many attempts to finally connect. Once it's connected, it works well and offers pretty good speed."
2,"Maybe for Vista/7/Linux, but NOT for XP","Intended to use this on an older Windows XP SP3 PC, and it would not sustain a consistent internet connection. While it intermittently maintained a connection to the wireless router, it would never load a web page when connected. I could ping externally to an IP address, but could not load any HTML pages requiring resolution (DNS). It looks like most reviewers are successful with a newer PC running Vista or 7. Perhaps it's the MIMO smart antenna, or the precoding/spatial multiplexing that comes with MIMO technology, but I would recommend against this adapter for Windows XP. I also tried, as suggested by another reviewer, to only load the driver (as opposed to the full application install), which was also unsuccessful."
1,don't believe it!,"I bought this product to connect a Mac wirelessly to my home network, because the room the Mac lives in doesn't have a phone jack. I bought this particular one because it touts itself as being Mac compatible. As for whether it is or not, who would know? In order for me to find out, I would need to be able to configure it. Alas, the CD that comes with it contains nothing my poor Mac can use. And when I called tech-support, they told me I would have to download the Mac data from their website, which, ahem, if I could do, I wouldn't need their adapter. I'm returning it. I had previously bought a Belkin router and been very satisfied with it, but now I will be thinking twice before buying anything from Belkin. So should you."
4,stand dont work,"the router works beautiful, i love this product very reliable. the only thing is the stand it comes with didnt work as well but i stopped using the stand and it works great. overall a great product."
4,works well,"This works fine, although my son says the one we previously owned was a bit faster. It was easy to install and seems durable/well-built."
2,Didn't work,"Only worked the first time I put this into my computer. Refused to work after I restarted my computer next day. Tried reinstalling drivers several times. May be I don't know how to make this work, but that's not how a good product should be."
4,Super easy to use!,I bought this product after reading reviews on here as to whether or not it was compatible with Linux Ubuntu! It is and it was really easy to install! Finally I found something that is compatible and easy to use!
2,Works ok,Seems like I had to reset this thing all the time. It was nice to hook up the desktop wirelessly but not worth the hassle of having to reset this thing all the time.
4,Good connection at an affordable price,This wireless internet connector works beautifully and will cover a pretty decent range as well. Highly recommended for any PC application.
5,Really pretty,"This is a really pretty mobile. Really well packaged so ready to hang straight from the box. It was difficult to tell the detail from the photos online, but it is much prettier in real life. The colors are quite subtle, pale pink, pale lime green, pale yellow and a stronger pink color. Each butterfly's body is made of beads, they have delicate wire feelers, and the fabric used has different patterns: plain, gingham checked/stripes, floral. I couldn't decide between several butterfly mobiles because it's so hard to see what they look like from online photos, but I am so pleased with this, it's really pretty."
4,Funny. Short. Not intended to be practical.,"Bresler tries a new approach in the effort to improve legal writing: mockery. This book is a long, alphabetical list of typical legal words, with suggestions for shorter, clearer, and less pompous ones. The list is sprinkled with humor and sarcasm that I liked.Turn the book over, and there is a clever reverse-dictionary. It lists simple, direct words and phrases, with suggestions for longer, denser, and more pompous ones. It's entertaining. Not terribly practical, but entertaining."
5,applies the theory,"This is an excellent little book written in non-technical terms showing how the various aspects of chaos theory work in the real world. The authors encourage readers to think in practical terms. The result for me was to understand the theory better as I saw how it applies to decisions about how NOT to ""run"" a company or the economy. There are far reaching implications here concerning social problems and their ""solutions"" using the vertical decision making model of top-down management."
5,Synopisis,"Here's the synopsis from www.amazon.com.uk - where the book is also cheaper...(though shipping, of course, would cost more. I tend to order from both the UK & USA sites, exploiting price differences; I also read reviews from both before purchasing, since they seem to have different reviews).Strange that the US site doesn't have a description of the book's contents ...A snobbish ad man has blown a huge advertising campaign for a chain of consumer warehouse stores. Punished by his boss, he is sent undercover to study the target consumer group: ... Politically incorrect and hilarious."
4,Time to dance with GipsyMenco....,"Gipsy menco's second album no boundries is great just like a first album perfection. Sal hanna who was part of the novamenco band until two years ago, created a new band, and he plays the lead guitar. No boundries will move your body and shake the spirit within you. Sal is a talented spanish guitarist. This album has some middle eastern percussion mixed with spanish guitar. The track sahara will live up to expectation. Sal has a talented band which they play in CA, san diego most of time. I recommend this cd to amazon's spanish guitar lover. Oh yeah, the track solo sin ti, sal, for first time, sings and it sounded as a beautiful song. check their web site.www.gipsymenco.com buy this album, and experience the Gipsymenco, check my reviews for more spanish music which you will like, thanks."
3,A case of mistaken indemnity,"I was just messing around looking at civil war stuff as I am, in fact a civil war reenactor. The title of this album intrigued me so I checked out a sound clip, wonder of wonders, metal music reaches my ears prepared for banjos and the fiddle. I'm not going to say it was at all unpleasent. I don't know if I will purchase this album or not, I think I would have to hear more full tracks before deciding."
2,My Horse Coloring Book,"Definitely not for younger children. Best for advanced readers and children with lots of years experience in coloring. However, by the time most readers would understand the text, those same readers would probably not be that interested in coloring, so I am not at all sure what interest bracket this book would fall into."
4,Overall Satisfaction,"The whole buying process was smooth. The product was shipped promptly,good packing, arriving in perfect condition. I had checked out the product in the jewelry stores and knew exactly what to expect in looks and price. No disappointment.At least the item had not been handled by many people as are the ones in the store.My wife is happy with the purchase and so am I."
2,Good read if you need a book in a pinch,"I ordered The Girl Next Door based on the description. While the book was a moderately good read, (I had no expectations of the book so to say i was dissapointed is not right because I was not.) it just didn't satisfy my reading need. Of course, all readers need to experience books for themselves and if they like thrillers (though this lacks a bit of thriller), you may wanna try this one. The story unfolds as most, with small speed bumps, and i can say i did not guess the bad guy. She did a good job with that one. I gave it two based on my reading standards."
3,Aaaaaaggggggghhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!,"Can you hear me scream from there? That is because there was NO picture when I bought this item and NOWHERE did it indicate that there was a price on it. When it arrived, all of the little packs are marked 30 cents! Now I have to stock my entire concession stand with nickels and dimes and all of a sudden the flunkies I have working for me are going to have to count out real change and do real math to sell the merchandise when I had everything in multiples of a quarter. I had actually planned to sell these for 50 cents, because people expect a certain markup, but they ARE very small. They are good, and my ballplayers literally demand them, but I can't wait until they sell out. Personally, I think if you sell pre-priced merchandise, you should so indicate."
1,No playback,"I have had this player for about 2 months. The player would load your disc selections very slowly. For instance, if you are advancing from one menu screen to another this player may take upto 15 seconds to load the next screen. Not only is the player very slow, but sometimes the player will refuse to load a disc. Best advice I can give is when buying a product such as a DVD player is to stick with the big boys. I have also have a Sony DVD player. I bought it about a year earlier. It is faster, has a better image quality, and always recognizes the DVDs."
5,"Good beats, nice flow to rap.","Lyrics understandable and spoken clearly. Without a doubt, the best album (HipHop) produced that year. (1989)"
3,some cool tracks,"Some tracks are super, some are so so. Probably not the best EB&R album. But the few tracks make it worth it."
5,Hollywood at its best,"I loved reading about Greta Garbo, Jeanette MacDonald, Judy Garland and the other MGM divas. The Golden Girls of MGM was very good reading. I would recommend it to all those who love movies made when Hollywood was the center of the earth."
4,VERY INTERESTING,"Why does most of the readers complain about this book? It is well written and very well described. All that the author says is true as she really made a lot of resarchs before exposing herself to bad critics. I was happy to read about Hedy Lamarr, Lana Turner, Greta Grabo and also, of those that I did'nt know that much like Norma Shearer and Jeanette MacDonald. I must say I was very pleased with this book full... of surprises!"
1,cut-and-paste rehash,"If you're wanting to read something fresh and original about these MGM women, you won't find it here. There's nothing new or revealing about any of them. Like her show-biz books, the author appears to rely solely on past bios, memoirs, movie books--without doing any original research. Since I'm a huge fan of all these MGM gals, I've read eveything I can find on them--and that's the data that appears in this book, which is filled with typos, errors, etc. You might check this book out at the library--but I'm going back to other much better written and researched books on Garbo, Crawford, Shearer, than what I found here."
1,Terrible,"Not worth the time it takes to read. She misquotes lines from movies, and as it's entirely possible to watch these and quote them accurately, you have to assume she spent as much time with these lines as she did with the rest of the material here. It's really laughably bad.Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
1,don't waste your $$,"I can't make head nor tail of this book as it does not include footnotes...are we meant to think that she could read the minds of all of these long-dead stars and knew exactly how much or how little one enjoyed sex with one man vs. another, etc...also it is written poorly, with many rather damning claims simply stated in a sentence and then no more about it. I am not sure who this woman is or was, but this is not among the sort of books one should use for any sort of research...i wonder if she has been sued by any of the estates of these stars...i did not know you could simply write things that he or she allegedly said (or thought) and not be required to list a source..."
4,Dragged Through the Mud? Some jumped in on their own!,"While we all know that these celebrity histories relate many falacies, some shocking tid-bits are true. For instance, it has been well known that Mickey Rooney, as baby-faced and non-sexual as he may seem, was quite the ladies' man. As a 16 year old he had an affair with a much older Norma Shearer (quickly broken up by Louis B. Mayer to avoid scandal). As for Hedy Lamarr, read about the admitted bi-sexuality and orgies in her own words... ""Ecstacy and Me,"" her autobiography, does not hide that she acutally is an arrogant nymphomaniac, and she seems to be rather quite proud of it! We all agree that there are false rumors that are attributed to these actors and actresses, but let's not forget that a lot of them brought sensationalism and scandal on their own. That is what makes their stories so fascinating, and that is why we read them."
5,First time buyer,"This TV is superb! I have spent the last 6 months trying to decide on which TV I wanted to buy (that wouldn't cost me an arm & a leg), and saw nothing that compared to the Toshiba. It has so many features, especially all the connections (for example 2 component video inputs). DVD movies on this are incredible. I can only imagine what it would be like to have a full surround sound system as well. The one thing I would like to point out is that if you have conventional cable (as I do), you will get a stretched picture (just the way things work out), but with the surge of HDTV and digital cable channels, it won't be long before every channel is HDTV. The other slight annoyance is the channel label option. Toshiba only allows you to input 32 channel labels...well who has just 32 channels anymore?? Like I said, more of an annoyance than a major downside. All in all, great TV!"
3,Great.... for a while,"We bought this TV back in 2003 when we first bought our house which has a large living room. Out little 27"" looked like a cell phone screen across the room. When shopping around for larger televisions, we noticed the crisp, vivid picture that the Toshiba had. I trusted the Toshiba name as well. After 5 or so years, we started getting red halos and distortion. The convergence board was shot. It costs about $300 or more to get this fixed.... more than what it is worth. I replaced it with a 52"" Samsung LCD, again, bought on name and picture quality. All in all, aren't all new TV's disposable consumer garbage meant for a few years and then to be trashed? Sad, but reality. Until consumers start demanding more for their hard-earned cash, I guess companies will just keep wasting resources and consumers will keep forking over for TV's, computers, and other electronics every few years."
2,Good tv but fades,"After a few months the picture would squiggle horizontally. It would take longer and longer for it to ""warm up"" and straighten out. I did some research and found this is a common problem with this type of TV. The board goes bad and can cost anywhere from $200-$500 to repair. The picture looks great, when it works."
2,not so good,"The book was very ordinary in all ways - writing was average, pictures similar to many other children's books, plot too preachy. Not much to recommend it."
2,"Repetition, repetition, repetition. Precious, perfect, pass on this.","Kevin Henkes is an incredible illustrator and has produced wonderful children's stories. However, this book is not one of them. My husband and I dread the nights when my child finds this book and asks us to read it. In short, the use of repetition in this book is unbearable. The story is okay, except that the parents' fixation of how ""perfect"" their daughter is, what a perfect name, and so on, is what the older generation thinks of as Gen X parents run amok with the preciousness of their progeny. (It's way too precious for this Gen X parent.) The ""mean girls in kindergarten"" story line is not handled in a very constructive way either. It's only through a fluke that Chrysanthemum avoids being bullied permanently by a group of 5-year-olds about her name. I look forward to better stories from this author in the future."
5,Beautifully written,This book is beautifully written! Keven Henkes tells a great story about appreciating our differences as individuals. I would highly recommend this book!
4,"Excellent,Excellent,Excellent!","What a precious book for little girls! Chrysanthemum experiences what many little girls do when they step outside their comfortable world, yet she is redeemed and her comfort zone is expanded and gives hope for all. I will read this to my baby girl when she is older, her and I both have ""different"" names. Like Chrysanthemum it may take a while to fully appreciate this blessing, and this book will be a valuable teaching tool."
3,Nice child's book,"Purchased for my niece - it was HUGE - 24"" X 30"" something to consider if you are carrying it on a plane (as I did!)"
5,Another Kevin Henkes Miracle!,"Adorable as ever :) I'm thinking I might use this for my children's lit paper, hey, why not? Love it just as much as I loved it when I read it years ago. The illustrations are still great (and snarky!), and the writing's just perfect, capturing the imaginations of both young and old. It's truly a tale of individuality for the ages."
3,Chrysanthemum,At first Chrysanthemum loved her name. Then when she got to school everyone made fun of her name.Until.....Mrs.Twinkle came.I like the book because I like Chrysanthemum. She is a funny mouse character!
5,The best picture book on earth!,"I am in Junior High and I still love this book! I read it for the first time in the 1st grade and enjoyed it very much. Its about a girl mouse who is teased about what an ugly, long name she has.. but finds out it isnt so bad after all."
2,is it a good message to send children?,"This is a sweet book but I question the message it sends to children. Chrysanthemum doesn't feel good about her name, hence herself, until a teacher gives C. her approval. I wonder how we can create a space in which children themselves know their own worth, limiting how this is determined by how others view them, whether positively or negatively. I try to model for and encourage my daughter that one's sense of worth comes from the inside. Because if we give up that power to someone else, in this case to the teacher who wants Chrysanthemum to feel better,are we not then opening ourselves up to others later taking our sense of worth away?"
5,School Worries. Bullying.,"She loves her name. But then she goes to school and someone makes fun of her. A classmate pokes fun, ""You're named after a flower!"" Chrysanthemum's self-confidence is shaken until she learns that her teacher's first name is Violet !!! Reminds us how you just never know."
5,Delightful,This book is wonderful. A great book for kids 3 to 7. Be happy with who you are is the message. Great ending and good use of descriptive adjectives. I'll be getting more books by this author. Jessica is quite good too.
5,The Great Tool,"For my particular application, I've utilized this product to remove rivets on an 84 Trans Am - if you ever have to replace the power window motors or door glass in an 80's GM car, this tool certainly makes the job possible for the DIYer. Without it, the task would have been destructive, with it, the job becomes pleasurable, as it enables to the user to neatly remove the necessary components attached to the door. After removing(cutting out) the rivet disc/head with the tool, you may have to run a drill bit to push out the remainder of the shaft. Excellent quality, excellent pricing and received in short time."
2,Didn't match description,"As other reviewers have attested, this is a small and portable charger. However, the European adapter was missing, even though it's in the photo and mentioned in the description. Being from Europe, this was a big disappointment for me."
4,works as advertised,"Charges camera batteries as advertised. Charges pretty quickly, no problems connecting/loading batteries. We've used it many times, holds up pretty well. The materials aren't the sturdiest, but it's a battery charger, not a hammer. Inexpensive, fast shipping, works as advertised. Definite recommend."
5,Compact - Does the job! Fast shipping,Works - car charger adapter nice touch. Did not need the foreign plug. Compact and worked well. OEM charger died on me.
5,battery charger,We recommend this product as it is compact and functional. Easy to store and easy to use. We like it and plan to buy several more.
1,It's a Crazy Life,"This so called video is nothing but a piece of garbage. I spent hardearned money on this to watch a bunch of [people] who don't even knowRicky Martin describe his career. If you want to see Ricky buy ""Ricky Martin, The Video Collection"" or Ricky Martin ""One night Only"" These are great Ricky videos. ... ... read the small print, only buy authorized Ricky Martin material ... This video doesn't even deserve to be rated with a star. NO STARS!"
1,Verrrrryyyy Bad,Several of us watched this video together and all HATED it. Don't waste your time and $$. I gave it 1 star because there was no negative key available. I was the one who invited my friends and family to watch it and was totally embarrassed by it.
1,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,THIS IS THE WORST VIDEO I HAVE EVEN SEEN IN MY LIFE TIME AND I HAVE SEEN MAY VIDEOS. CAN NOT BELIEVE THE PRODUCERS OF THIS HORRIABLE VIDEO WOULD DO THIS UNKIND JUSTICE TO RICKY MARTINS FAN'S.
1,Don't be mislead!,"If you are a Ricky Martin fan you'll be highly, highlydisappointed with this video. You never even hear Ricky's voice.They show the same pictures over and over and just keep flashing his name across the screen playing music that sounds ""similar"" to Ricky's music but is obviously not! It's horrible! I can't believe they got away with making such a lame video and the sad part is, Ricky fans buy it thinking it will have SOME footage of Ricky. Save your money everyone."
1,"If I had the option, I would give this tape NO STARS!!!!","What a waste of money. I wouldn't even reccomend this tape for die hard longtime fans. There are so many wrong facts of Ricky in this video. They barely show him. The people they interviewd didn't know what they were talking about. When they talk about Ricky growing up in Puerto Rico, instead of showing pictures of Ricky, they show footage of PR. Save your money. Don't buy this video."
1,total jumk,"Don't spend money on this ripoff. There is no music, and no Ricky Martin. Amazon.com ought to be embarrassed for offering this product. False and misleading advertising to the hilt."
1,"THIS VIDEO IS TERRIBLE, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!","This video is such a waste of time and money. It's 48 minutes of garbage. The information on Ricky is wrong and incomplete. The people who did this video did not do their research. This is just one example of the poor quality of this video. They claim that Ricky entered Menudo after Charlie or John left. Hello!!!!! Ricky entered Menudo when Ricky Melendez left, Charlie was still in the group and who the heck is John? There are interviews with radio DJ's about how Ricky has risen to fame and how popular he is, none of the information is new and it's mostly their own opinion. I was very disappointed when I saw the video, it is AWFUL. Please don't waste your time and money on this video, it sucks. It was obviously made for capitalistic purposes, don't do them any favors."
1,Please don't waste your money!!,"What a disapointment! Only 1 interview with Ricky. Just alot of people talking about him. Very, very disaponiting."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"Although I wanted another manufacturers equivalent phone, I was willing to accept this one. I have been quite happy with all of the quality aspects of it, but had one gripe. The phone comes with a headset jack and headset controls, but no specifications for the headset. It took several web seraches, a phone call, another web search and a trip to Radio Shack before I found out that the headset is a standard cellular phone headset. I finally bought a Plantronics M110 headset, and it works great. Why they couldn't mention it in the manual, I don't know. Great feature, no information."
1,I wouldn't based on my experience....,"I've had several problems with this phone. First is the speakerphone volume, turned all the way up, you still have trouble hearing. When the headset is plugged in and you try to use the handset, I pick up some radio talk show. So I have to plug and unplug the headset all the time. Lastly, after having to plug and unplug the headset. (I'd say 30 times) I now have to play with the connection to get it to switch back to handset or speakerphone use. Hard to explain. But I'm sure it's a loose connection in the phone. Wish I'd bought a different phone."
2,Okay phone but features wanting,"I found the same issue as Brian, with the unrelenting blinking of the voicemail and line buttons, only mine is on line 2 (Brian, what is ""power cycling?"". I found the same issues as another reviewer with the other callers on a 3-way conference call not being able to hear each other. The manual is completely insufficient, as is any other help available. There is no on-line help available, and the 1-800 number gives only a very limited number of pre-recorded answers. Over all, because of the lack of information about how to use the phone's feature, I find my experience with this phone more frustrating than satisfying."
1,"Basically, it's a piece of junk.","My brand new phone wouldn't even allow me to set up basic features. I tried many times to change the dialing from pulse to tone, to no avail. It would say ""ok"" and then just automatically go back to pulse. The phone rang while I was sitting in front of it and then stopped ringing ... but I could hear it still ringing unanswered in another part of my house. I could not answer it because the call was no longer available on this phone ... it simply said ""C4 Call Blocking"". Tech support didn't have any suggestions other than unplugging it for ten minutes to allow the phone to reset. I decided to unplug it for life and try another brand."
1,junk,Intermittent static feedback in my ear on every 4th or 5th word while talking no matter where it was plugged in. Tried it at 2 different friends' houses and got the same garbage. Whoever I was speaking to said I sounded like I was lisping. Exchanged it for another (same model)and got the same static. Tried swapping out phone cords to no avail. Evidently GE's quality control is non-existant. I'm returning this piece of junk and will not even consider another GE product!
2,Would not recommend.,The voice mail indicator light would not work. I purchased a headset and in addition to having static the volume was too low to use. I thought it may have been a defective phone so I exchanged it for a new phone and had the same issues. I eventually bought a panasonic and while it did not have the same features the quality was great.
1,GE 2 line phone,"The phone is a piece of junk.This company shipped me 2 phones and both were defective and it was not even the same problem. Each phone had a different problem.Company gave me a FULL Refund for the phone and the shipping, so I am happy with the service, but I would NEVER buy a GE Phone."
3,Lots of fluff,"This book has a couple of really good nuggets of information. However, like the other Reality series books, it's over crowded with talk about methodology, fake meetings, requirements gathering, and other stuff. That's fine for one book, but all three books have the same generic information over and over.If the book concentrated specifically on working with Java in ColdFusion, it would have been much better. The book is worthwhile for the small pieces of information it offers, but be realistic with your expectations."
4,Sof Feet,"The screens are fine. They are somewhat less fine than the prior screen I had, but they work. Service was excellent."
4,A great sloth,"The sloth is very soft and cute. My only complaint is that the felt toes are a bit too sharp, so the sloth cannot be cuddled with complete peace of mind. Otherwise a fantastic plush three toed sloth."
1,Do not buy!,"I bought this phone so that I would have a desk speakerphone with an independent cordless handset as well. Handset will not allow you to go mopre than 20 feet before static takes over (other 900 Mhz and 2.4 GHz phones do fine and I've tried in 2 houses), and now handset has started to fail altogether - buttons fail. It has turned into a speakerphone. Just bought AT&T 2230 which appear to be great so far to add needed cordless handsets."
5,Rot rod car guy rock!,"If you're a car nut and like fast hard ripping rock, you'll love this. Get your adrenaline rush with these guys. Don't let the name scare you off, its not devil music, its just fun, wild guitar and lyrics that will put a smile on your face and get you motivated. So fire up the hot rod, insert the tunes, twist the volume control to its stops, put it in gear and step on the freaking gas!"
3,Pantaloon - a joy from chlidhood,A wonderful colourful enchanting children's story I remember from my own chldhood. Just as delightful today. My grandson will adore it.Sadly there was damage to the last page of the book and a rather poor repair - where the vendor claimed all pages were intact. What a shame!But the book is wonderful nonetheless.
1,It doesn't work,"I can't get one single can open with this contraption. I too end up using my handheld can opener.The blade is off by millimeters so when you try to puncture the can, you can't. The blade ends up on the side and all it does is wurr. No can opening, nothing. This is not a good buy."
2,No so great,"I got this as a wedding gift and it is more of a hassle than anything else. The cans slip off more often than not, and I usually end of using a hand held can opener. This is just something cute for a red kitchen..."
2,Almost too awful for words,"In all my years of studying Norse Paganism and Shamanism I have never found anything so pitiful as this book. Norse lore and practices are conspicuous by their absence. The shamanic content is non-existent and her ""knowledge"" of the runes is total New Age clap-trap.Volumes and volumes of information on the Norse traditions, including seidr, are available but she can't even stick with the subject for half a book. Since when are crystals, chakras and psuedo-feminist whining part of Norse traditions? What's with all the Californian psycho-babble?Those looking for genuine information on Norse traditions would do far better looking for works by Freya Aswynn and Edred Thorson rather than this fluff-bunny bilge."
1,Bad Norse Dianic wicca with a pronounced female chauvenist.,"Incredibly disappointing work by DJ Conway, who normally can actually write. The bias in this book was so bad that I literally threw it across the room several times while reading it. Coming from someone who can easily stomach Z. Budapest and the ecofeminists, thats saying a lot. I was hoping to learn something about shamanism and spirtual growth from a woman's perspective. Instead, I got a hodgepodge of bad wymyn's hystory (owing entirely too much to The Chalice & the Blade) some divination techniques, some very odd meditations and a lot of anti-male propaganda. Despite the fact that she wrote another book on different belief systems, her knowledge of belief systems as used in this book is pitiful. Where is the woman who wrote _Moon Magick_? The writing was also disjointed and there were sections where it almost appeared that the polemics had been inserted after the text."
3,3 Stars! ~ I really enjoyed this lovestory,"If Winter Comes by Diana Palmer~ Harlequin Special Release ~ originally published in 1980Carla is a young reporter who is still learning the ropes. Her assignment is the city political scene and this puts her right into the Mayor's domaine. Bryan's a widower and since his wife and daughter's death has given all his attention to his job as mayor. There's something about the quirky new reporter on the beat that sparks his attention and he finds he's eager to be with her and does all he can to pursue a relationship. All is well, until Carla has to turn a story that could ruin Bryan's career. Though, I really enjoyed this lovestory, I found it didn't have the intensity I've come to expect from Ms. Palmer. A very good read though."
2,"Ok, but...","Gorgeous ring and reasonably priced, but should have read the reviews a little more closely. Noticed (after daily wear for less than two weeks) the band is all bent out of shape. The metal is soft enough to bend back into shape, but expect it will break soon with the repeated movement. And yes, the leaf points do catch on everything. I wouldn't recommend buying this."
3,"So cute, but I keep catching it on everything","It's a beautiful design and goes with my everyday clothes. It arrived in perfect condition and looks like the picture. (I've ordered things that end up looking cheaper than the picture) It was shipped quickly.My only problem is that I keep catching it on everything. If I catch something on the top leaf, guess where the bottom leaf is going... That's right! It keeps jabbing into the flesh on my finger. And after a while, it's sharp!I'll still wear it sometimes."
2,Decepcionado,Estoy un poco decepcionado con este producto en la foto se ve muy diferente a como es en realidad parece ser de un material de poca calidad muy delgado el anillo para el precio tampoco creo que se podia esperar más.
3,Pretty but cheap.,"I for sure didn't want to listen to the other reviews about this ring bending and breaking really easily so I bought it anyways. but it'strue. Its really pretty but i've had mine for several months and it bent badly in the first couple months i had it. never broke, but only because i wear it sparingly for special occasions. I wouldn't buy this again"
4,My favorite ring!,I absolutely love this ring. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the band is very thin and bends too easily. I've mis-shaped and bent it in all directions. Luckily it hasn't broken! The leaves sometimes get caught on things but it's still a cute ring and I've received many compliments.
3,Alright,"Nice pretty, feminine, but VERY delicate. Metal is thin and gets caught on stuff easily and bends easily. It is cute and I like it but I wish it was sturdier. Worth the money paid"
5,Too Cute!,Love this cute ring! Get TONS of compliments on it all the time. Adorable ring for the price! I wish I would have bought a few more to give as gifts!
2,Beautiful ring but bad quality,This ring basically snapped in half the 3rd day that I wore it. It has a really pretty design but the ring itself kept bending out and catching on my clothes. I wouldn't waste your time paying for a ring you get to wear for a week if you're lucky.
5,Sweet simple ring,I love this ring. I stepped on it and broke part of a leaf so now it's an adjustable ring and I can wear it on my little finger and it blends in well with other jewelry. It's simplicity and bright silver make it a ring that can be worn a lot without getting tired of it.
4,Beautiful ring however..,"When I saw this ring online I instantly loved it. So I bought it and the ring itself is beautiful and is really classy and eleant looking, but as other people have been saying this ring can become rather irritating when trying to put on clothes and such. The little pointed leaves at the end tend to snag onto things and when it does it sometimes hurts the one wearing too! The ring is also very thin thus (like everyone here has been saying) causes it to warp and whatnot. Although there are a few complications with this ring i still am able to wear it (even though its a little disfigured) and it looks normal, except when taken off.. but who cares! This ring is pretty and pretty ok so... yep."
2,disappointing :(,"the ring itself is beautiful and comfortable, it didnt tarnish or stain my finger. however, the leaves on the ring managed to snag on everything, from putting on my sweater in the morning to pulling the tv remote from between my couch cushions. due to the thinness of the band of the ring, after being bent so many times from snagging on just about everything, my ring snapped into two pieces... while i was sleeping!! i woke up to find the ring simply sticking out of my pillow. lovely ring, perhaps not the best quality. i enjoyed it while i had it."
1,Extremely Fragile,"I loved the way it looked, but it continually bent and after the second day of wearing it, the band actually snapped in half from me trying to curve the band back from it becoming disfigured around my finger. It is not worth the asking price. It looks much thicker and more sturdy in the picture, but when you get it, you will see how delicate it is and can easily break."
3,Cute ring... meh quality.,"I actually bought this ring at Kohl's but it was around the same price as here.I adore how the ring looks and feels, but it bends out of shape pretty easily. As long as you're careful you can make it last; I've had mine for about six months now without major problems. It does catch quite easily on pockets and threads and couch cushions.All in all, I like the ring for occasional wear but it's definitely not an every day piece."
4,get this ring,"Although a little crude in the execution of the design, for this price it is a great find."
3,Don't Be Fooled,"What a great Idea to sell an album, Name it Blind Faith, that way someone (Like Me)not knowing better will come along and say now thier's a Blind Faith Album I don't have. Thats the only reason I purchased this album, but after listening to it I'm not dissapointed as its not that bad of an album. The song I enjoyed the most was Hungry For Heaven. Uni Records, 1989, Unid 502.Track 1) Blind Faith (4:44)Track 2) Wastleands ( 4:40)Track 3) Crime of Loving (4:13)Track 4) Tell It Like It Is (4:14)Track 5) Caledonia (4:36)Track 6) Hearts Of Gold (5:03)Track 7) Hands of Time (4:52)Track 8) Hungry For Heaven (4:01)Track 9) Miracle of Life (4:45)Track 10) Close My Eyes ( 4:55)"
3,Laid Back AOR,"Walk on Fire released Blind Faith in 1990. Blind Faith is a pure AOR album from start to finish. Leaning more towards pop than rock, Walk on Fire's music recalls some of the lighter elements of Survivor, Alias, Loverboy, and perhaps even Jon Butcher. This is the kind of music you'd expect to hear on just about every 80's movie soundtrack.Despite the fact that it doesn't really rock, I enjoy this album quite a bit. It's laid back and puts me in an 80's frame of mind. AOR fans should try this album, especially since it is so inexpensive. If you like your music on the heavier side, you'll probably want to skip this one.Blind Faith was Walk on Fire's only album, since soon after its release the musical landscape became quite unfriendly towards this type of music."
4,Wrong Picture ... Item is Completely Different,"Please note that this Tetsubin pot has a muted raspberry color and the design is based on blossoms (so it is quite different from the black Tetsubin pot with waves that is shown in the picture).I just received this Testubin pot which I intend as a gift, and I will still use it as a gift, even though it looks quite different from what I thought I was buying. I have examined the pot carefully and it is indeed a very nice Tetsubin pot.The only issue I notice is that the edges of the lid are slightly uneven rather than perfectly round. This is a very slight blemish and it is clearly based on the original mold (i.e., it is not a defect with the specific pot that I received). This minor imperfection is probably not something that most people would even notice and some might even say it imparts character (but it was just enough to lower my review from 5 to 4 stars).PS: 12/10/'07 I see that they have now changed the picture. It now shows the correct pot."
2,Color does not match,Ordered this item based on the lovely pale pink color on the picture but it arrived today and is a dull rust-maroon. This is a gift for a friend and it's too late now to return and get something else. You know how you feel when you're not sold on the gift you are presenting? This is quite frustrating!Seems like this is the second time the image used misrepresented the product. They really should change it.
2,Disappointed..,"I ordered this as a gift for my tea-loving mother. I had Amazon ship directly to her house gift-wrapped for Xmas. When I visited her a week later, I looked at the tea pot and was shocked as to how small it was. It is partially my fault for not looking at the dimensions prior to purchase, but I had no idea it would be so small. IT IS NO LARGER THAN A SMALL TEA CUP! For $50+ dollors I expected a little more size. I must say that it is very well crafted...it's just so darn small. Make sure you check out dimensions prior to purchase."
5,When You Are Done Reading ORDER OF THE PHOENIX.....,"......read this book about the great writer, J. K. Rowling! I like how she played guitar and drew pictures, besides doing her writing. The author of this biography says that J. K. Rowling and Harry Potter are like the Beatles. From what my parents say about them, I think so, too. Then I heard on the webcast interview from London that J. K. Rowling's favorite group is the Beatles--so, it's like this author knew that already! You'll love this book if you like Harry Potter and J. K. Rowling. I love the names of the fungi in the Forest of Dean. If you grew up there, maybe you'd have J. K. Rowling's imagination, too! She read lots of books, too, which figures, doesn't it? This book tells more about the books she read than any other book I've seen about her. Over the summer, I'm going to write a letter to J. K. Rowling using her addresses in the back of this book. This book is packed with information! Buy it and read it!"
4,cant wait to read.,i love mr. rowlings books about harry potter. he is such an awesome writer. i want to know everything about him.
1,Nothing new in this book - very disappointing,"I bought this book and Sean Smith's biography of the same name as I love the Harry Potter books and wanted to find out more about the author, who seems to be quite private and doesn't reveal much about herself. There is no new material in Kirk's book - in fact she has taken a lot of the information from Smith's book which came out 2 years ago so you may as well just buy that one!If you buy this book thinking you'll read something new, don't bother."
4,It worked,"It worked as advertised. Glued firebox back together, and glued a broken up Chimera also.So far, so good. I would order it again."
5,Wow! What a great written book.,"This is not only one difficult subject to write about; but it also must have been difficult to get people to talk about. It was a black mark not only on the japanese army, but also the entire japanese way of fighting the second world war. Thanks to a great job of writing this sensitive issue, this author has done a fantastic job of writing this book. It is interesting, hard to put down and scary that this could have not only happened, but been officially condoned by the entire japanese military system. I thought this book was great, in every aspect."
2,Not the best author...,"This is a very important subject to learn about. However, I did not enjoy Hick's style of writing. He is over dramatic at times, ""Japan remains an international outcast, an economic superpower which comands respect but which has few, if any, friends in either East or West"" (p.275), and he does not cite any of his quotations or sources. I would have liked to read up more on his sources, but they are not there. I often wondered where he got his translations from too.Not that I am trying to downplay the comfort women issue. Hicks makes a good attempt at trying to cover it, but his writing is really convoluted and boring. The personal story clips were very revealing, but again, where did he get them from?Try a different author on the subject, one who is more professional about their writings."
3,Japanese Misdeeds,"It's interesting how different American's treated the Japanese and Germans after the war. Japanese atrocities against the Chinese were incredible, yet the Emperor remained in power, the war criminals lived long and productive lives, and to this day the Japanese have not admitted some of their crimes or apologized.This was a disturbing book, but this is the sort of thing you would expect in that era and with the war."
4,The Comfort Women: Japan's Brutal Regime of Enforced Prostitution in the Second World War,"Very good, well written book."
2,"Good picture quality but poor mechanical quality, service","I purchased the Toshiba 65H81 because it had an excellent picturefor the price. However after I received the TV (a story of itsown) I found that the screen is bowed inward quite a bit (over1/4"") which creates picture distortion and reflective distortion.My first mistake was calling a Toshiba service center who wantedto charge me to look at it even though it was still underwarranty. My second mistake was calling Toshiba who had nosympathy for my plight. Fortunately another Service Center usedsome of the built in adjustments to improve the picture, howeverdistortion still exists."
5,"Great deal, A+ picture","I researched ALOT. ... Doesn't have the dynamic pip, and other bells and whistles, but I don't miss that. To avoid screen burn do not view in 4:3 (reg tv mode) more than 20% of TV on time--and that's w/ ANY widescreen. But that's easy b/c TV has 4 ""modes"" of stretching regular TV to 16:9 (widesreen/dvd style)--easy to adapt/like the conversion. I LOVE this TV, find it hard to leave my basement sometimes!"
1,Toshiba will not own up to a MAJOR problem ...,"Guess what I learned after buying this TV little more than one year ago ..... a projection TV CAN be damaged from screen burn ......We usually watch all stations in the wide screen mode and I was more than dismayed to find the MSNBC logo burned into the bottom left corner of my TV even after only having this unit for slightly more than a year. Toshiba replied to my complaint saying that is was misuse of the TV ..... and they confirmed to me that projection TV's can suffer from burn in an issue that seems to have been omitted by the paperwork that I got with the unit ....Up to this point I have told everyone of how happy I am with this TV as being one of the best, crystal clear and bright TV's on the market hands down ...."
1,You've got to be kidding me,"I believe this book belongs in the teenage romance section of the bookstore. Through the course of one week, six different people fall in love with each other. A few other semi-interesting events are scattered around that general idea. But how many times must we read the line- ""She needed him badly.."" Somebody shoot me!"
1,It's a stink bomb,"I really hated Guilty as Sin & Night Sins. This book was a poorly disguised Harlequin romance. I never guess book endings, this one was so obvious that I knew it at about page 200. It was difficult to finish. It really stunk up the joint. It will be a long time before I attempt another Tami Hoag novel."
1,WHAT A MISTAKE!,"I picked this book up because the cover led me to believe this was a mystery - instead, I had to force my way through 'trembling bodies, heaving breasts' and the like. Even as a romance book, this one was *bad*! This really insults women - the lead character is the only woman in town without pink hair, penciled eyebrows and corns all over her feet. The 'mystery' part of the story wasn't all that believable either. Save yourself the $6 and leave this one on the shelf!"
3,"Heavy on ""traditional romance"", light on murder mystery","I thought this book was a very easy and fast read. As a person who reads a wide variety of books, I felt like this was a fair romance. It used the very dry, old romance theme of man and woman thrown together, hate each other, fall in love at the end, etc. But, I had checked it out thinking it was a good suspense/mystery novel. It would have been an excellent book if the romance had been played down just a bit and the suspense had been the main focus."
2,Slow From The Get Go!,I thought this book was too slow and had too much inner thought to the characters. Everytime suspense seems to be looming around the corner we have to get another life story from Elizabeth Stuart. I was disappointed mostly because I had heard the book was really good. Apparently the friend who told me this has not really read any really good books yet.
2,Gratifying but tough,"I've read several of Tami Hoag's novels and found this one to have the same potential harrowing effect ""Guilty as Sin"" and ""A Thin Dark Line"" built up, but it was drawn out and weighted down by the rather violent nature of the relationship between the primary characters (Elizabeth and Dane). The secondary relationships were well drawn, the characters evolving with Ms. Hoag's usual style; the plight of teenagers and the generation gap were well illustrated; and as a whole it was enjoyable. However, the disgust and malice often displayed between the two key protagonists truly began to disturb me. Domestic abuse and disrespect between people (especially lovers) was as chilling to me here as the murder theme central to ""Still Waters."" Ms. Hoag still remains on my short list of must-read authors, however; her latest works especially are well worth exploring."
5,Still Waters,"This was the first book I read of Tami Hoag's. I got it when it first came out, it is still the best thing that she has ever written. A great who-done it, single parents with teenaged children and a hot romance. Elizabeth and Dane are great. Dane even gets a mention in Guilty as Sin."
5,Absolutely excellent ...didn't want it to end.,"This book was wonderful. Just the right amount of romance and mystery. I loved both the main characters, Elizabeth & Dane. It grabbed my attention the very first page, and kept it through to the last. This book is a must read if you like broody, handsome, challenging, independent male leads. It will not disappoint!"
1,Deceptive Marketing - This is a Romance,"Written in the early days of Tami Hoag's career - and recently re-released in paperback - this is quite different from such recent works as Ashes to Ashes.The back cover prominently includes a press quote that compares Hoag to Patricia Cornwell, which completely fooled me. This is a romance populated by stock characters that is held together by a weak murder mystery."
1,disappointed,I was VERY disappointed. I had been told Tami Hoag was a great mystery writer. This was my first book by her and couldn't believe this garbage was appealing to anyone. I didn't even care who the killer was by the end. No surprises really either. I am afraid to read any of her other books in fear of more disappointment.
2,"""still"" is right","typical ""modern romance"" book... shallow characters, transparent plot, roll-your-eyes dialog... but all in all, a good read if you're in the mood for a ""quickie"" (bad pun intended), something that requires few brain cells to absorb."
5,Tami Hoag is brilliant!,"Tami Hoag's writing is exceptional. You can actually see in your mind what the narrator is saying. The person reading the book was perfect for it, using multiple voices and dialects. I have a 45 min ride to and from work and listening to books on CD makes it much more enjoyable."
2,"Slightly entertaining, but very cheezy.","This was my first book by Hoag, and probably my last. Even though the story was entertaining, I could tell exactly what was going to happen and who the murderer was. It seemed as if I was reading one of those cheezy Sunday 9:00 movies. (The ones with just a bit of sex and violence, so they come on just as the little ones are going to bed.)"
4,YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PUT THIS ONE DOWN!!!!!!!!,"Ms. Hoag certainly knows how to spin her tales with just the right combination of romance with a suspenseful murder on the side. I have never been disappointed with her work. The minute I finished this one I picked up ""Lucky's Lady"". I have also read ""Night Sins"", ""A Thin Dark Line"", and ""Guilty as Sin"". All are excellent and highly recommended."
5,"From the moment I opened this book, I couldn't put it down!","Determined to start her life over Elizabeth Stuart and her son moved to a new town. Writing for the local newspaper, just doing her job, when she makes a startling discovery.....A MURDER. The people are convinced that she or her son are involved, so does the very arrogant sheriff. Recovering from a divorce, he refuses to believe that a thing called LOVE exists......until he gets passed his own pain and sees Elizabeth for who she really is."
1,Garbage!,"I rarely write reviews - but always read them. I should have listened to the other reviewers here that said this book sucked. I'm actually pissed I wasted time reading this crap but I'm one of those people that once I've committed to start reading something, i HAVE to finish it! A previous reviewer mentioned how two dimensional all of the characters are - so true. Not only that - they just weren't likable characters - not one! Especially the main character who seemed very trashy and the male character lazy and a bit stupid for a cop. This book may have turned me off from this author permanently - hopefully it was just a beginning career pass for her!"
1,This was truly appalling,This was truly appalling! All the characters were two dimensional and the plot was completely transparent. This is in fact a cheap romance masquerading as a thriller. Very disappointing and I would not recommend that anyone buy this.
1,"Don't any of her men have ""normal"" names?","Before I start I should probably explain that I'm an editor, so I'm rather particular about what I read. I'd heard of Tami Hoag for years, but hadn't read anything she'd written. Then, yesterday, I decided to pick up this book and check it out. I want my money back. I detest romance novels, and this one is a romance novel trying to be a mystery. As a writer, I'd be embarrassed to present characters like this, and the names are straight from the stock romance name list. I've learned my lesson--no more Tami Hoag novels!"
1,Was this Mills & Boon?,This was truly appalling! All the characters were two dimensional and the plot was completely transparent. This is in fact a cheap romance masquerading as a thriller. Very disappointing and I would not recommend that anyone buy this.
4,Don't try if you are going to complain about the romance.,"I really enjoyed this book, but you have to be aware that is a cross over book between thriller and romance. Don't expect it to be like her most recent novels, and you will really enjoy this for what it is - an entertaining book with two very likable characters."
3,Finally a book of Tami Hoag's caliber,"I have loved Tami Hoag books for years. However, I was very disappointed in a Thin Line and Magic. This book actually is the awesome writing of Tami Hoag as found in Cry Wolf and Dark Paradise. It was a page turner! It was inevitable for the two characters to be in love, but the writing and thrills were riveting just like the titles mentioned above. Tami Hoag is miles ahead of Patricia Cornwell, who is a very predictable and boring author."
1,"Boring, predictable and mis-categorized as a mystery","This was the most disappointing book I've ever purchased!!! The story was so predictable and boring. I knew who the murderer was soon after the initial appearance, the motive was not worth waiting for. Tami Hoag reads like Rosemary Rogers or Danielle Steel. Not at all what I was expecting based on the comparison to Patricia Cornwell on the book's jacket."
2,Okay - More romance than mystery not my favorite,"This was the first book I read of Tami Hoag. I am a huge mystery fan and just could not get into this book. Like other reviews I found that there was to much ""romance"" and not enought mystery. To much time was spent on Dane and Elizabeth getting ""together"". It usually only takes me a couple of days to finish a book, but this book took forever to finish. In the end I didn't care what happened I just wanted the book to be over. It may be a good read for someone who likes a lot of romance and a little mystery."
2,Still Waters should be titled Polluted Waters,"I'm sorry, but the likelihood of the male romantic lead finding our heroine even remotely attractive after she opens her mouth is surely stretching fiction to the limit. She has no redeeming characteristics for the reader to latch onto (and I was trying). I couldn't summon up any sympathy for her past because she just seemed like a foul mouthed shrew and what was meant to pass for snappy repartee was just plain bitchiness."
3,Romance and Mystery! Good job!,"This novel is a good example of how romance and mystery/thrillers can be blended together. It is also a good example of how a novel can have more than one plot (romance and mystery). The story kept my interest and I thought that the ending was full of suspense. If you enjoy mystery/romance novels then another good book by Ms. Hoag is ""Cry Wolf""."
2,Didn't expect a romance novel,"This is the first book I have read by Tami Hoag. Somehow I didn't realize it would be such a romance-type work, with the leading lady getting sexually worked up every time she came within a foot of almost any male, including her son. Still, I kept reading it, and the plot wasn't bad."
2,Who wrote this book?,"I've read most of Tammy Hoag's books and this was like a Harlequin Romance! The story line was good but I got so tierd of the repetitive descriptions of who wore what and how ""his manhood stirred"". I now wish I had not read the book."
2,Predictable,"I am only going to finish this book because I need closure. This book is disappointing, predictable and insulting to women. After this I never want to read another book where the two main characters (who are highly attractive, of course) initially have deep dislike bordering on hate for eachother which eventually bursts into passionate love. Yuck...and enough of this garbage already."
3,Not as good as her others! But still a good read.,"I am a huge Hoag fan - but do not judge Tami Hoag by this book. Please read ""Night Sins"", ""Guilty as Sin"", ""Cry Wolfe"" and ""A Thin Red Line"" first! She is a great writer and this book doesn't quite measure up to the others. It's a little predictable and not as nerve wracking as the 4 above. However, it is a good book that held my interest. After reading the 4 above, then try ""Still Waters"" and ""Dark Paradise""."
1,Bad Lifetime movie,"I've read some of her other books, and I thought they were pretty good for the suspense genre. This was almost impossible to get through. It reminded me of a Lifetime movie, and a bad one at that!"
1,"How did this get published? (zero stars, actually)","...it's not that I mind romances per se, but the dialogue and the so-called ""building tension"" between the two main characters was so appallingly bad that I literally cannot believe that it got published, and with wide distribution yet. I've never read such awful prose. Tragically, I was stuck with nothing else to read. I would recommend to others in that situation to sit and just think deep thoughts rather than submit to the torture of this mess. I am actually embarrassed for Tami Hoag."
1,Previous Tami Hoag fan,"I have read several other books by Ms. Hoag, but this may be the last. I realize this is one of her early works, but it should have remained obscure. Far from a ""suspense thriller"" it is little more than a ""bodice-ripper"" with a predictable ending. The overworked verbal duels between the protangonists becomes repetitive banter after their second meeting."
1,"Corny, predictable, borrrrriinnggg","I have read several of Tami Hoag's books and liked them quite well. I had to force myself to finish this one, and couldn't believe it was the same author!! As other reviewers have mentioned, it's like reading a brainless, barbie-doll romance novel. I'll be reluctant to read another of hers..."
2,Read like someone other than Tami Hoag wrote the thing,"I have read a number of Tami Hoag mysteries, and was looking forward to enjoying another. Still Waters read like a warmed over Sidney Sheldon....not anything like what I expected from past novels of hers. Can't recommend this to anyone!"
3,IRON RANGER comments,"I just finished reading Still Waters. It was neat reading something that was based in Minnesota EXCEPT I would like to invite Tami Hoag to the Iron Range. I would like to comment that we have more than wolves and people on the dole in Northern MN. Although the taconite industry has had it's ups and downs, my husband and many others make a very decent living here working in the mines. Otherwise, the book was pretty interesting."
3,Still now complete...,I feel the information given on Edgar Cayce is still not fully portrayed in written text now. I know there has to be more accurate records that show the results of his work and the people he encountered.
2,Boring at times,Parts of the book are believable and very interesting. Author waste to much writing about families and all their mishaps. The Akashic Records are interesting and believable but the other stuff is just plain boring.
1,Academic indulgence,Somehow Craske has managed to find the most bland and lifeless art from this period in art history. He does love his caricatures and monkey paintings. Had I no experience of the subject other than this book I probably would not dig any deeper; thankfully that is not the case.
5,Could the five millenniums old art of Yoga be key to better understanding Christianity?,"Could the five millenniums old art of Yoga be key to better understanding Christianity? ""A Meeting of Mystic Paths: Christianity and Yoga"" is Justin O'Brien's desire to combine the two disciplines in creating a more complete spirituality. The two, although at first sight very different, there is much in common with them despite thousands of miles and thousands of years difference in origin. With the idea that Jesus himself may have heard some of the ideas of Yoga makes ""A Meeting of Mystic Paths"" a fresh set of ideas, sure to interest even those who don't follow Yoga or Christianity."
1,"Great toy, terrible camera","(...) We wanted a basic digital camera that our 8 year old could use to take pictures. What we got was a very high-tech looking toy that takes horrible pictures. As much as we tried to get a clear, crisp picture, it was not to be had. The slightest movement blurred the picture, and the flash simply washed out the entire picture in a wave of whiteness. Don't waste your money."
2,Maybe a good camera for kids...otherwise ?,"Not really a practical deal. Comes with no memory card and it is virtually impossible to get in touch with the manufacturer. When taking the picture, you cannot see it on the LCD screen, so your best guess is necessary when capturing a moment. If you can find a more reliable, popular brand for the same price or slightly more, go for it. I'm not at all impressed with its functionality."
1,a heart breaking disappointment and a sorry excuse for an instrument,"I'm a musician and let me tell you, this thing is a piece of junk! My wife and I were so excited for our little girl to have a real piano! We took it out of the packaging to put our cute bow on it for christmas morning and I played it... It sounded so bad my wife started crying because her vision of the perfect christmas present was ruined. please don't purchase this item, your child would be better off banging on a bucket with a broom stick."
1,Looks cute but sounds horrible,"This little red piano looked very cute. I thought a real mechanical piano would be a much nicer musical toy than an electronic keyboard for my 3 year old, so I ordered it. Boy, was I dissapointed when it arrived. First, it is very cheaply built, using the lowest grade particle-board for the case. And it was so out of tune that it was not even possible to play the simplest children's songs using this piano. I don't recommend this piano for anybody who actually wants to utilize it as a musical education toy."
3,Nice toy piano but completely out of tune.,I was really looking forward to a toy musical instrument that had nice non electronic sound. Well this little piano finally arrived and is completely out of tune.My daughter loves it though.
4,very durable,"My son loved this piano.He is 15 months and uses it everday. It is very safe also, once found him standing on it to look out the window. His friends who are older still enjoy playing on it too. It was a great buy. probably can use it till hes 5!"
1,Please do not buy this phone,We bought this phone a little less than a year ago and it is the worst we have ever owned.-- The main issue is the very short talk time. Even when we first bought the phone after a few hours off the base the battery would die while we were talking.-- The speaker volume is quite low.-- Caller ID does not work for call waiting.-- Easy to accidentally erase messages.
1,Major piece of junk!,"I bought this phone because it had all the features I wanted, such as caller ID on both the handset and the base, digital answering machine, etc. It has proven to be a piece of junk. When answering calls on the handset we get funny noises during which the caller can not hear you. Finally when the noise goes away you might be able to talk. More often than not though, it starts to ring again and then you are disconnected. The handset has proven to be almost worthless for receiving calls. Lately when calling out on the handset, you might get two beeps instead of one when you push a button. The phone is not intuitive at all and you have to keep referring to the manual to use some of the features. I would like to return this phone, but I have to box it up at my own expense and return it. In the meantime I will have to go buy a new phone to replace this one while it is being repaired, so what's the use of sending it back? My advice: Buy something other than a GE product!"
3,Everything we need...almost,"This phone is advertised as having every feature we wanted in a cordless: comfortable handset, speakerphone, answering machine, and memo function. Unfortunately, the so-called memo function is not designed for ease and functional use. The machine does not record the memo with the rest of the messages, so when someone comes home to check for messages, they never know if a memo from a family member is waiting for them because there is no indicator of one. On our old phone, we used the memo function all the time to record a quick note on where we were or when we'd be back. On this new GE phone, whatever is left on the memo is also heard by someone leaving a message on the answering machine. Aslo, the manual that comes with the phone gives no info on how the memo works or how to erase a memo."
1,Trouble getting caller id to show,"We cannot find a phone number to help us in the instruction book. There is a number in the back, but when we called it, it gave us another one that was no longer in service. We cannot get the caller id to show up. We have done all of the trouble-shooting, are signed up for caller id as we have had it for several years. We are to say the least very frustrated. Please give us info as to who to get a hold of. Thank you."
5,I used it as a study aid for Security+,"I used this book in its initial PDF format as well as beachfront quizzer.Even in its earlier stages of development it was adequate for passing Security+. Providing you meet the requirements set by comptia.Definately not for someone wanting to learn Security from scratch. But if you have some solid experience network/systems administration ""at least a year and a half"" then this is a good guide to the exam."
2,Warning! Book written before the Final Exam was out!,"This book is very informative. Unfortunately, It was written based on the Security+ beta exam and not the complete final exam. It is good for Security study in general. But, not a good focus for the complete final Security+ Exam."
1,Paul Blart: Mall Cop,I Immediately returned to Paul Rhimes because of scratches and not sealed. Mr Rimes did receive it over a month and still have not received a credit to my credit card account. Definitely not reputable Company. I have read other reviews for Rhimes and saw same explanation given. Where do I go next???

2,wanted it to be good,"I was really excited to see this film. Loved the trailer, but sadly as hard as Paul Blart commits to this role. The jokes leave you dry. The funny just didn't work here for me. Not sure if it was the editing, I felt the film was long. Had great ideas but it didn't flow funny."
2,"Funny, but nothing really special","I probably am going to rate this movie higher than it's worth because I have worked with many security guards in the past ten years as well as a stint as one myself so I can see the humor in the jokes of this movie, but for others I can't really say, and there was something annoying about that fake mustache on Kevin James I couldn't stop staring at it in half the scenes. Anyway I'm going to give this movie a 2 out of 5 I did get a few good laughs out of it so if your into comedy I'd say give it a rental probably not worth a buy."
2,Why did they even make this movie.,I love Kevin James but this movie was horrible. I would have rather did laundry that watch this movie. Maybe even watched the View. It maybe had two funny moments but the previews didnt portray the acutal feeling of the moments they showed as I didnt even laugh at some moments that I saw on the previews.Stay away even from renting it.
4,Enjoyable,"The trailer made me think that this movie would be more of the slapstick comedy. but like the movie he starred in with Adam Sandler (Chuck & Larry) Kevin James delivers a solid performance as a bumbling but good-hearted mall security guard. The ease with which he drove the Segway was a hilarious addition to the character, and the plot and lessons in here are good.It's surprisingly clean for what you'd expect, but that is what makes this a good movie for both kids and adults. A real treat in this movie was the acrobatic/gymnastic skills of the band of thieves, it was amazing and fun to watch them jump, slide, and leap along the mall. A solid 4 out of 5 stars."
3,"A bit tedious to watch, coulda been better, coulda been worse","Man, this looked kinda funny on the trailers, and we sat down as a family to watch it. Afterwards, I remember saying, when am I going to learn that these types of movies are never as funny as you expect. Plus, the story was a bit ridiculous, which I realize is what they were going for, but it still didn't make it very humorous. I think it only deserves 2.5 stars as it wasn't really funny, but at least Kevin James' character wasn't a jerk and he was likable. We also just watched Bedtime Stories, and that movie was worse as Sandler's character was rude and obnoxious. Basically, the movie was mildly entertaining, but you won't be laughing out loud. Just don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. We later put Shrek in, and now that has some funny jokes and twisted humor that will get you laughing."
3,Great movie but moronic copy protection,"I enjoyed the movie in the theatre and at home. A hilarious - and at times even heart-warming! - spoof on ""Die Hard"" with great characters and many fresh ideas for comedy. Kevin James is fantastic. However, it took me a while to get the DVD running on my PC. The copy protection is so good, it is actually a viewing protetcion. The DVD wouldn't start with any of my players. I had to check out some barely legal software to get it working. Shame on SONY/Columbia!!"
4,Paul Blart: Mall Cop,"Very funny movie, good laughs, good plot, and loved Paul blart acting. Good clean movie. No sex, nudes, or 4 letter words. A good family movie. All you need for this movie is Pop corn."
5,Worth the Money,"I generally avoid places like Wal-Mart and so when I found out I could get this movie almost as inexpensively as I could at Wal-Mart, I didn't think twice about buying it. It was a great gift for my wife on her birthday. Kevin James is hilarious and the movie is quite clean. The plot isn't anything crazy but it is still an entertaining comedy. Very pleased with the purchase overall."
2,"Rent this movie if you need to see it, save your Money$$$","Let me say this first of all, I love Kevin James, I think KING OF QUEENS is hilarious. So much more could have been done with this script! I expected so much more from this movie, I guess. The story was weak to begin with, what we saw in the trailer is the funniest parts of the movie. Don't expect much more."
4,movied skipped,awesome besides movie skipping it was a dang good movie will rewatch after it the sctraches off it will but more from thises
5,Great Movie on So Many Levels,"This movie was great on so many levels: It was fairly family-friendly; very funny; had a likable (and unlikely) good guy (Kevin James); additionally, it was both an action movie and a love story (of sorts). As a guy, it was very hard not to feel for James' character, who was lonely and lovelorn and wanted to feel a sense of significance about his life, and to feel attractive to an attractive member of the opposite sex. Additionally, his character, Paul Blart, messes up badly in the movie sometimes, to humorous effect. As for the action part of the story, it was sort of a humorous version of ""Die Hard"" in a shopping mall!"
4,"Pretty funny, a good watch - Paul Blart, Mall Cop","This movie was worth watching. It had good humor and kept me laughing mildly. It had a cute story line and good characters. The movie moved along nicely and had a sweet ending. Sappy romantic comedy? Yes, pretty much, but definately worth the watch! A good family movie, Kevin James does a great job in this role."
5,"Hilarious, warm, funny, great stunts","I have seen this at the Cinema and loved it!Paul Blart is a loveable Mall Cop wannabe Police Officer who lives with his mother and daughter and one day the mall is taken over by criminals.....Don't take any notice of the negative reviews, this is a real feel good movie and one that will make you smile!"
3,"funny, but predictable.","Kevin James is always funny, so I knew the movie would be fairly good. Knowing the genre of the film, I knew it would be predictable, so I wasn't dissappointed with it. If you're a Kevin James fan, I would say it's one for your collection."
1,poor,"I like Kevin James but he should have thought about doing this movie. It was stupid humor. I bought it because he was in it but, I am now sorry I purchased it. Could not wait till it ended. Sad to say it ""SUCKED""."
1,90 minutes of dreck...,It is becoming clear that Kevin James' humor does not translate to the big screen. I have every season of King of Queens and i think it is one of the top 10 tv shows of all time but i have a feeling i will be begging for this 90 minutes back at the end of my life. How on earth Nick Backay and Kevin James found this funny is beyond me. On a positive note i think that the 10 and under and the 70 and over crowd might enjoy this trainwreck. 0 stars.
1,Awful; couldn't even finish the movie,"After the actors in this film awkwardly stumble through countless banal dialogues, tiresome fat jokes, and humorless cliches, I had to turn this off about 30 minutes into the film, not because I was sick with laughter, but because I knew that I could immediately find a better use of the next 90 minutes of my life than continuing to watch this godawful movie."
1,WARNING!!!!,DO NOT ORDER MOVIES FROM AMAZON!!!!!! JUST OPENED THIS MOVIE AND GUESS WHAT DVD IS MISSING FROM PACKAGE!!!!
1,Very Awkward.,"It is a collection of awkward situations loosely connected by a thin-line story. It is not funny, I just do not know how to classify this movie."
1,Mall Cop is a terrible movie,"I was looking forward to this movie as some of the preview scenes looked promising.Once I started watching it, I had a very hard time not turning it off. The movie just isn't funny. It has some decent moments in it, but it's more about a very pathetic man who is a loser due to poor decisions in life than about someone who ""gets the girl"" due to his untapped potential. Where there is an attempt at humor, it comes off as pitiful and pathetic - not funny.There is no viable romance here either. The ""girl"" seems to be a fine young lady, but why she would want this goofball makes no sense other than her feeling sorry for this pitiful fool.Stay away from this disaster."
2,WASTE OF MONEY,"Don't waste your money! This movie was pretty stupid & not your typical Kevin James humor. The trailers on TV commercials made this movie sound like it was a side splitter, but is far from it. Kevin was much funnier in King of Queens. Invest your money on King of Queens instead of on this crap."
2,maybe good to leave on during a noisy party?,"Not much groundbreaking material here. Fat awkward guy gets flirty eyes from a hot skinny blonde , dic*head nemesis at work, umm.... hostages taken at an urban mall? Safe humor to watch w/ your younger kids or somethin to leave on at a party where the plot line doesn't matter. A few funny lines but mostly just absurdly delerious plot developments. There is a reason this was co-produced by Adam Sandler. It is certainly that type of turn-off-your-brain type of humor. Watch it when you are totally bored or have a free coupon to use up."
2,A great film...if you're twelve.,"This film about a loveable loser mall security guard made Seth Rogen's ""Observe & Report"" look like comedy genius. ""Blart's"" nonsensical plot (guys on skateboards and BMX bikes take over a mall) seems aimed at the 10-18 crowd who are meant marvel at the cool yet totally ridiculous stunts and to laugh at the different ways Kevin James can make fun of the fact he's obese. Plus there's an over abundance of bad late 70s/early 80s rock songs.File this mall cop malady one under: Avoid & Evade."
3,Ehh...,"Paul Blart: Mall Cop really isn't my kind of comedy. Had some moments where I was amused but not once did I ""laugh out loud."""
1,Couldn't Get Through It,"Despite hearing good things, I honestly thought this movie was unwatchable. It alternates campy Disney schmaltz with miles and miles of fat jokes that weren't funny to begin with. Ultimately, this movie reminded me of ""40 Year old Virgin"" but humorless and just sad. I felt really bad for the main character.. so bad I completely forgot to laugh."
2,As Bad As I Expected,"I like Kevin James. I knew this movie would suck, and I was right. Where was the humor? Not in this dud.Lets see, a group of skateboard and bike riding gymnasts/robbers take over a mall. Hmmm. The robbers sommersault over railings...gee, who thought this up? James' scenes are just boring.This just proves that actors only care about the money. Quality scripts just don't matter.Avoid this one."
4,A good movie for everyone,"The movie is good for anyone, a funny in a lot of ways. Also you will love the ending.But if you like a lot of blood the movie isn't for you."
1,Not close to funny,"Once again I've done it to myself, I listened to the previews on tv and fell for another lie. This movie is a complete joke. This movie was just a good way to kill an hour and 30 min of my time. All I heard on the reviews were "" critics agree that paul blart mall cop is the number one comedy of the summer"" oh please if this is what media brainwashes people into thinking whats funny than I feel sorry for you. Not once did I laugh at the dull humor portrayed in this garbage. There is no way an overwait mall cop could stop a gang of skilled ninja-like criminals and win the hot girl of his dreams after rescuing everyone from a hostage situation that even the SWAT team could not take care of. I will never listen to critics again. The next time the critics say a movie is good, I will know that 9 times out of 10 that the movie will probably suck."
1,"Aww, I hate to say it but this movie stinks on ice!","Well I think the Idea of this film was funny but that's about all. Somehow it all went terribly wrong. For me I thought that the movie was a cop out. It made Paul so weak and stupid that you did not want to even root for him. He's the hero? yeah right. He was annoying and that made the film annoying. Unlike his lovable character in Hitch, here Kevin James is just a moron with no likable qualities. He is not a symbol for what fat people can do nor is he a champion of security officers everywhere, he actually makes them look worse if that's even possible. I was embarrassed for him.Top it off with the fact that the dvd would not even work properly in my PC and you have yourself a dud. Catch this on cable or better yet wait for it to come on free regular tv; let the commercials pay for this one."
3,What a commercial for Segway scooters!,"3 of 5 stars for the shopping mall police story Paul Blart Mall Cop. Another way to look at this comedy movie is a 1.5 hour commercial for Segway scooter. OK, Kevin James plays Paul Blart Mall Cop. Of course, Paul has a crush on a girl working in the mall. Blart is shown to be training a new hire who later is part of a group who invade the Mall taking hostages and robbing the bank. With the parking lot full of SWAT teams, it is Blart to the rescue of the girl and saving the mall. This is a cutely dumb movie. A bit funny. Easy on the brain and worth the time to watch it."
5,Kevin James is amazingly funny in Paul Blart Mall Cop,This movie became a sleeper hit as a low budget film turned blockbuster with $176 million worldwide I like this movie when I first seen the TV spots for Paul Blart Mall Cop I really wanted to see this movie which I did. I want to see this movie about two more times I like this Die Hard in a mall idea as a family movie with Kevin James as the title role I can't tell you about the movie go buy this movie on Blu-ray or Dvd and you love this blockbuster hit.
4,i liked it,"my hopes for this movie were pretty low,so imagine my surprise when itshattered my expectations and it turned out to be a very a goodmovie.sure,there's a bit of corn and cheese and ham,and what's wrongwith that,in moderation.but there are also some good laughs,sometouching moments and a what i thought was fairly solid story with heartand depth..Kevin James is pretty easy to like.throw in a possibleromantic love interest and you can't help but root for the guy.all iknow is, my fiend and i had a great time with this movie.for me,PaulBlart:Mall Cop is an easy 4/5"
3,Yeah cheer mixes vol.3 -is okay.,This is an ok cheer mix cd. It has a pretty good selection.But it is not for you if you need longer mixes.the mixes range from 30sec. to 1-1/2min mixes and radio versions of the songs.
1,never had a seal,I got this as a present. I had used other cheaper modules of the same brand so I was very excited but the threads never matched up and it didnt seal enough to produce anything remotley like coffee let alone espresso. I was very disappointed that this one was so cheaply made that when I called the manufactures they said that becouse I had used it they wouldnt give me another one. I have had success with this manufacture in the past but beware they are hard to get a hold of and not very nice with there customer service.
1,poor performance,"I have an aluminum model and I have not had any problems for years. I merely wanted an upgrade. I was skeptical of this model based on others reviews, and I received one of the bad ones. For whatever reason it just didn't work. Odd as there are minimal parts, and I checked for obvious clogs, etc. and there did not appear to be any. Perhaps it was the over pressure valve, etc.I went with another option instead, and wouldn't recommend this product, as I had to pay shipping 2x (initial and return) and it isn't worth rolling the dice."
1,Dangerous product!!,"My 10 cup Venus almost killed me when the top blew off of the bottom tank just a second after I had checked if it was still brewing. I was about 3 feet from it when it exploded and sprayed coffee all over the kitchen. Had the range hood not been there it would have made a hole in the ceilings. It is more than obvious that the safety valve didn't do its job. And I put water for only about 2-3 espresso cups. Will definitely report the product as unsafe with CPSC.Update: I reported this with CPSC and to the local store when I returned it. Hopefully someone will do something about it. Was brave enough to keep the 4 cup Venus I purchased here and so far it has not tried to harm me! Actually I haven't had any probems with it so far, knock on wood. The problem with stove top espresso makers is the lack of crema, otherwise they make good espresso."
2,Will need to buy another espresso machine ...,"I bought this 4-cup Venus stainless steel Bialetti product after using a similar aluminum one that I loved in Italy. It does not perform as well.If you can wait 25 minutes for it to make you ONE cup of espresso (even though it says 4 cups, there's no way it would make that much), then this might be ok for you to buy it. I thought it would make at least 2 cups, but it doesn't. The water doesn't go all the way out of the bottom part, no matter how long you leave it for - after 25 minutes, you have one cup...I would take it back, but I can't be bothered. Will be buying another one for sure - maybe this time an automatic espresso maker."
1,"Poorly made, expensive for such inadequate quality.","This product is product is extremely overprice for such poor quality. The performance of this coffee maker is abysmal.The big issue is that wont seal properly even after applying good amount of force, about 30% the water gets release on joints instead of going up.I saw a bialleti made of aluminum original from Italy and they look at least 5 times better quality that this one that is made on India, just look the difference on the plastics, the finishing and side valve.Now I have to buy another coffee maker of this because does not work, and I'm unable to return this because a bought this from a amazon third party seller.Go a buy the aluminium version .. not this."
1,BIALETTI MUSA EXPRESSO POT: Threads are off set: POOR quality,You can tell this unit came off of a speedy assembly line. Cheap plastic handle which is held by a single screw that continually needs to be tightened & the machine threads of the two sections of the pot are offset so the coffee pot sits at angle & does not seal. From reading past posts I can see that about 60% of the units have this problem. Complete waste of money.
2,"OK, but there are better","I have been making stove top espresso for many years. When I couldn't replace my last pot, I gave this Bialetti a try. In its favor, it does make coffee, but there are in my view significant drawbacks to using this pot. The steel is thin, so thin that the insert came dented. The water does not all vaporize when making a pot. The design of spout and handle is such that steam regularly burns my hand when I'm pouring the last drops. I know Bialetti invented this kind of pot, but others have improved on its design! I recommend you buy another brand,"
3,Bialetti Venus 6-cup,Nice and elegant percolator makes excellent coffee. I'm a Bialetti fan but I purchased it and had it working great for about a year. One morning I was going to serve my coffee and the handle got out of the percolator and I was close to a huge skin burn. Despite this incident it's a nice coffee maker but its design should me modified.
4,6 cup,"good stove top but does not really give 6 cups, actually not much more than the 4 cups, maybe i need an 8 cup!"
4,Great little pot!,I originally bought the aluminum Bialetti which I totally loved but became anxious about the aluminum controversy. I returned it for this one which also works very well. It is difficult to tell sometimes exactly when all the water has been transferred from bottom to top but the little left in the bottom seldom makes a difference. Very easy to clean and makes excellent coffee after a bit of trial & error regarding precise amounts needed. Would highly recommend.
2,"No distortion, but needs multiple suction cups",The clarity of this mirror is good - but with only one suction cup it tilts and you have to bend your neck to use it. I've taped a post-it pad to the back to level the mirror.
4,Good quality mirror,The mirror it self is good quality and no distortion. But it tends to sag with just one suction cup.
4,The Complete Guide to Buddhist America,"This is an excellent and helpful book for anyone wishing to know the locations of sanghas, monasterys, and the like in North America. There is also interesting commentary from various North American practitioners of Buddhism included in the material. The overall layout of the book is good and the amount of information is massive. My only complaint is that the information is divided into the three schools of Buddhism and then it is put in geographic order by state and province. I would have preferred it to have been all geographic with the type of Buddhism practiced placed in the listing. Others may be perfectly happy with how the book is set up however. Regardless of this I would recommend this book for those who want a large directory of Buddhist groups in North America."
5,Reckless who?,"Do you ever addicted to a song? This 1984 original release date album from unknown group contain Heart Of Steel, an adrenalin pumping track. Listen to the drum's rhythm pattern with accompanying guitar! Give it a try, hair metal lovers will love this. 5 stars just for this track!The Reckless line up were:Steve Madden Vocals GuitarTodd Pelon BassDouglas Lang Adams Vocals GuitarSteven Wayne Lederman Drums"
5,Phenomenal,"This is a remarkable work, detailing the perceptions of Islam prevalent in the West since the birth of Islam in the 7th century. Daniel documents the medieval misconceptions and shows how they still exist in today's popular culture AND in modern scholarship. He displays his proofs in the context of discussing the particulars of Islam and how they were perceived by the West. I wish everyone would read this book. It would considerably aid Muslim-Christian relations in the world and especially this country."
3,3 Star Read,"Norman Daniel has done a fairly well job on ""How Islam was misinterpreted by Western Orientalists in history"". However, I wish he had used more Islamic references (works by Muslim scholars) rather than that of non-Muslims. There are sometimes things that are not correct in Islamic viewpoint and would contradict to religious techings of Islam, but I guess he has relied more on non-Muslim scholar's works in writing this book.So my suggestion would be don't just read this book alone if you want to know about West's viewpoint on Islam. You should read other books to know more on this topic, to get the real idea."
1,"Useless, not a study guide but a user guide",This is a the most useless book I've ever bought. It doesn't give me anything that I need to pass the exam. Only a text describing what dreamweaver mx 2004 really really is. Not a study guide how to meet the problem. Moreover it lacks of challenging questions.Very Dissapointing.
5,"Logical, thorough and easy to read","This book is a stand out as the best equine internal medicine text. Throughout the book the authors consistently review the pathophysiology involved, the evidence currently available and to a lesser degree their own personal experience. This is in stark contrast to many books which are written in the format of ""I do it therefore ..."". The emphasis on pathophysiology prompts understanding not just regurgitation while the presentation of evidence follows the direction of the profession towards evidence based medicine.The book is presented as a comprehensive resource and does not work so well as a quick look up text as it can be difficult to find specifics in a hurry. However, for the purpose of indepth study and understanding of equine medicine the book is an excellent resource."
2,Bad recording of a Great Book,"While the actor, Heathecote Williams, clearly can read, either he was a poor choice for this task, or the producers of this audio version had no experience with audio books. The production quality of this recording is terrible. I purchase a lot of audio books, but seldom have I had such a horrible listening experience.The actor speaks in a droning monitone and then starts to yell in a high-pitched and squeaky voice.I would suggest that you read this book rather than listen to this badly produced set of discs."
4,Informative,"I found this book to be very informative and highly recommend it to anyone concerned with how ""sad"" or withdrawn their child is."
5,Answer,hey dude!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Knight Cavalry belongs to Kain Macdonald. He's some guy in the super 5 thingy
4,so cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This b-daman is so cool looking!!!!!!!!! In the stores it's so rare....but I found it!!!!!!!!!! At first it's power was weak...even in down position!!!!!! But then I put the thing on it's button off and it ruled!!!!!!!!!!! The Knight Wing is excactly like the Cobalt Power Wing ............a little weaker though.-_-I hardly ever put it in up position 'cause who likes control.By the way.........................................................does anyone knnow what knight cavalry is????? Some say power and accuracy......................................then some say it's power and control and it says it's power and control on the box!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Someone tell me please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Knight Cavalry,"Knight Cavalry is one of the best B-Daman.He is powerful and also aims very well because of his great control. With the Knight Wing you can give him a boost of either power (in ""down"" mode) or extra aiming power (in ""up"" mode) for precision shots. He works really good with rapid fire stuff and I strongly suggest using a power buckle or an accurasy barrell.It is very durable if you don't screw around with him and the Knight Wing works really good with other B-Daman. ^-^"
4,The calculus of pleasure and pain is not enough,"This is John Stuart Mill's restatement and qualification of the philosophical doctrine of' Utilitarianism'- the doctrine that the aim of Society is to produce the ""greatest happiness for the greatest number"".The philosophy whose great inventor was Jeremy Bentham built itself upon the idea of a calculus of pleasures and pains, an almost mechanical measuring of feeling.However the complexity, contradictory quality of our inner life suggest that any calculation of this type has a certain shallowness and illegitimacy about it.In any case Mill's idea of utilitarianism does connect with his conception of Liberalism, and does have effect on his later thought even as he rejected most of it."
5,great widescreen for the price,"I did a lot of research before buying this widescreen tv. I chose this tv for its price point and features and was I pleasantly surprised at the picture quality. The picture is so sharp and the colors are really vivid. I especially like the 16:9 widescreen format. It is great for watching dvd's and future upgrade to high definition picture. The free shipping was also a plus to be considered, I had no difficulties with the delivery company. This is a great buy."
1,One problem after another,We bought an out of the box model in early December and the color was so bad (the repairman said it had a bad board of some sort) we decided to return it and bought a new one that was delivered 1/5/02 after 2 weeks the focus went bad and this TV needed a new convergence board which we are still waiting for! The store where we purchased the TV is replacing it(because we bought their warranty). I hope the 3rd set works -I can't recommend this product-I'm very disgusted.
4,black jewel popcorn,this popcorn is delicious and like the old fashion popcorn! I popped it without one kernal unpopped.. so it is easy to pop and so fresh tasting.
5,Legends Revisited,"I don't like fantasy novels. I have read far too many verbose tale of elves struggling to recover some musty old talisman. Pretty much swore off the whole genre. That was before I read the Athanor books. Instead of mystical ancient kingdoms we have New Mexico and Nigeria. Instead of a hokey sword wielding hero(ine) and their trusty sidekicks we have an astounding cast of characters ranging from computer-literate sasquatches to immortal farm animals. How refreshing! Ms Lindskold has developed a wonderful idea for a series. In each of the two books so far she has focused on different members of the Athanor community, at this rate it will be a long time before she runs out of fresh ideas. This is one fantasy series where I can't wait to see the next installment."
5,A thoroughly enjoyable read,"A thoroughly enjoyable read on many levels. I'm so happy to have ""discovered"" Jane Lindskold. Her characters are thoroughly believable and well-fleshed out. ""Legends Walking"" deserves a nod for having as its setting one of the most mysterious places in all of literature-- Africa. Lindskold, through her characters,treats the citizens of Nigeria with respect for their pre-European contact beliefs, and appreciation and concern for their efforts to modernize. The athanor are very much like the Greek gods that some of them have lived as -- capable of all the same moral and emotional highs and lows as any non-magically gifted being. I highly recommend Lindskold's books as a much-needed break from all the Tolkien clones that contribute to the needless deaths of millions of trees. I am eagerly awaiting the next sequel -- or even a prequel!"
1,Authentic Practice Exam for the Professional Engineers' Exam,"Confusing solutions are unclear. Exam is out of date (1996 publishing). Unfortunately, it is only available book of its kind (probably lack of demand)"
4,Good product - great views and music,Well: this is a partial review. So far I have just seen the Views from Space and Nature's Colors. Great music and HD shootage. Great for relaxing... I am planning for using the images and sounds with my baby when he (or she?) will be born.
2,"Acceptable, but barely","Phone does not indicate that charging is occurring while connected to unit. Only indication of charging activity is via LED on body of component. Charging does, in fact, occur, but you are left to your best guess as to when or if the phone is fully charged."
5,Easy to install,"I put this kit on my 08 Nissan Titan, it was easy to install, about 1 hour by myself. I have a leveling kit installed on the front and wanted to keep my truck level with/without a load. Before I put this kit on my truck it was about an inch lower in the rear, but with 20psi it leveled out. This kit on a Nissan Titan will lift the rear 2.5 inches with 80psi. I keep about 20-15psi with no load and 40-50psi with a 7000lb boat. I installed the air chucks on my top two license plate bolts, replacing the factory screws by drilling out the plastic mounts.The only problem I had was with a leak on one of the bags but with a little water and soap I found out that I needed to tighten the air bag fitting...leak fixed.Kit was installed a year ago...no problems works great."
4,Airliftt rear spring air kit.,"They advertise 1 hour installation, it took me four hours. It involved putting a jack between the frame and axel to make room to fit the bags without distorting them. One u-bolt was instlled upsidedown to avoid interference with brake line.Other than a little hassle with installation they're great. Only 15lbs pressure brings me back to level with my travel trailer.Amazon price beat all other advertised prices, and shipping was free."
3,A little disappointed,"I am a huge fan for anything that has to do with treasure hunting- Indiana Jones, Fools Gold, National Treasure, you get the idea. I was so excited to get this movie I could not wait. It is a good movie- just not what I thought it would be. The action is not fantastic and there are lags in the movie that make it hard to keep focused. That being said it wasn't terrible and I will definitely be watching it again but it was not the action packed treasure hunting movie I like to normally add to my collection."
5,good against ticks and other parasites,"I live in the heart of the deer tick region in the USA, and this product keeps ticks off my dog better than frontline plus, revolution or advantix II!!! I tried this for the whole food nutrient benefits, and got more than I expected - I love it and have used it almost daily for 2 years now. My dog has enjoyed the taste mixed with his food even though he doesn't like other garlic powders."
1,20% Success Rate,"Seriously. For every CD that burned successfully, 4 of them ended up in the recycling bin. Useless."
4,"Not one of Grable's best, but still enjoyable.","This film, although not one of Grable's best, is still enjoyable. The plot is rather contrived, but is still humorous. Some of the songs are corny, but, again, they are still enjoyable. Due to advancing pregnancy, producers didn't want to use the ""Song of the Very Merry Widow"" routine. Instead they substituted one that consisted of Grable leading girls in complicated military marches. Although the finale leaves much to be desired, the film is still enjoyable and was a top money-maker at its time."
5,Worth The Price To Watch The Ending,"This film's finale is a staged rifle drill by dancing girls -- and they perform as well as almost any military unit you will ever see, with Betty Grable calling cadence. It's worth watching the entire film just to see them march."
3,Comment on commentary...,"Listening to Richard Schickel's slow delivery will probaby put you to sleep although he does provide some interesting background information on some of the stars in the film. He states, correctly, that Joe E. Brown will probably be best remembered for his role in ""Some Like It Hot."" However, he mistakenly states that Tony Curtis was the ""girl"" for the Joe E Brown character when it was actually Jack Lemmon.Must also agree with the other reviewers that this is a rather forgettable musical with equally forgettable songs."
3,BETTY GRABLE THE PIN UP GIRL,"Betty was the most popular female star in movie history, ten years in the box office top ten , that puts her in the realms of todays mega grossing stars taking into consideration inflationbetty grable rules ok"
3,"A masterpiece, but only for the theatrical at heart...","I thought, myself, that this was a lovely movie... as the characters were played realistically by their actors... but they were not too stiff in their acting. considering the time frame in which this movie was created... the acting is unuaually free in it's content. This movie is a masterpiece for the lovers of both Shakespeare and theater."
4,B movie fans will appreciate this collection of hard to find items from 1946-1955.,"This collection contains the heretofore unattainable, super campy, high voltage (for its time) WOMEN'S PRISON and a good dose of a toned down Cleo Moore (who appeared to far better advantage in ON DANGEROUS GROUND with Robert Ryan, a film not included in this collection). The films in this volume are for those who enjoy well constructed B movies. They're hardly film noir, but we're given plot twists, we see injustices and things are snappy. Genre and era fans will hit the ground running & enjoy these productions. The rich doll we see in NIGHT EDITOR would've thrived in the days of Lucretia Borgia and kept up with the Marquis de Sade, and very much lives up to the title of this collection. The prints are crisp and fine, and the sound is good. I enjoy them and return to them often."
3,4 B-Quickies of minor interest,"I expected much and the greater was my disappointment, when I watched these 4 movies. I addition I am not a particular fan of Cleo Moore. To be honest I didn't even know her which may be due to the fact that this actress never was very popular in Germany. Even more because she quit film business in 1957 already to marry a millionaire.Anyway: My favourites are 'Night Editor' with a memorable Janis Carter and 'Woman's Prison' with some good acting by Ida Lupino and Phyllis Thaxter. Not to forget Howard Duff - Lupinos spouse - in a convincing role as the prison's medical adviser. Picture quality is excellent and so are the extras (all trailers and some picks from Columbias archive treasures).Summerizing the question is: Is this really film noir? The answer is: Partly..."
2,Pretty Bad,If you never heard of either of these movies well now we know why. Questionable whether one would consder themfilm noir but not questionable as to the content. No redeming features as far as I coutd see.
4,nice looking,you get what you see. Very nice locket. Might have some problem when i'll put some pictures in it since there is holes around the heart.
5,Love this album!,"An excellent CD with many rarely heard artists and songs. Original artists so this is the best version.You might not recognise the names or tunes when you read the list, but when you hear it.... it'll all come back."
1,"I didn't like the character ""father bear""","We really enjoyed the other little bear books. My 4 year old loved the original ""little bear"". But this one fell very short from what I expected. The story is not very pleasant, and father bear really rubs me the wrong way. In the story, father bear after being gone for a long time returns home, sits on his chair, and then yells at little bear when he's simply having fun with his friends (trying to rid himself of hiccups). Little bear gets so frightened by his father yelling at him, that his hiccups suddenly disappear. At first, I thought father bear would start laughing, thinking he scared little bear on purpose, but no, father bear is just a grump that couldn't be bothered with his little bear, and just wants to shout and be left alone to read the paper. Not the family message you want to share with your little ones. I say, stick with ""little bear"" and skip this one, as father bear is a mean character that you'd probably rather be gone."
1,Painful for my daughter and for us,"My daughter was assigned this book as reading homework in kindergarten. Honestly, we all love to read and have varied interests, but Father Human, Mother Human, and Daughter Human all wanted to scream with the boredom induced by this book. Yes, the words themselves are appropriate for the recommended ages, but that's about the best thing I can say. We didn't find it interesting or imaginative in the slightest."
4,What a terrific guide for any new commers,"Not the average tourist guide.Instead of pages wasted on Fisherman's Wharf (which is as much San Francisco as the Wax Museum), you are guided through small streets and crannies of the City.Because of the fire of 1906, the architecture is vastly different neighborhood by neighboorhood and this guide decribes them plainly and with grace.Reading the book a week before a trip out will educate you and create more excitement than any Fodor's or Mobile can do"
1,The wrong book.,"If you're looking for the equivilent to an AIA guide for San Francisco, this is not the one.Issues:It's full of typosThe building descriptions are bad.The authors give little or no context to the structures they highlight and no real reason why they selected them.This makes what is outlined look totally random.Many of the blurbs are pointess musings or anecdotal info.They appear to have very little to say and are unable to write a simple building description.As historicans and architects, you'd think they would have a firm grasp on historic preservation. they don't. A few descriptionsgive the impression that they see facadism as a perfectly legitimate form of historic preservation when in reality it is one of the most loathed ""last resorts"" preservationist's are forced to use."
2,Mediocre,"I can understand that certain students may want to get ahold of some basic concepts (especially if they are not up to speed yet on their higher level math skills) but this book does not make things all that clear. Sure the concepts themselves aren't all that difficult to grasp but the way in which the information is presented is sometimes confusing and distracting. There is a lot of useless information in this book, such as the authors random remarks on loving other cultures among other things. What place off topic subjexts such as those have in a physics book is beyond me. Take out the useless or obscure information and the book would probably be only 2/3 of it's current length. That extra space could be used to introduce the reader to more formulas and teach the reader how to set up problems. That would probably serve them better and give them more preparation for future physics courses."
4,Over America,The cinematography was great but the conversion to Blu-Ray was not there It was shot Pre-9/11 so I don't think the cameras were up to par for a conversion.
5,Excellent foot care for Diabetics,Excellent foot care for Diabetics. Unable to find any longer at our local pharmacy or health care provider in our local area.
5,The next best thing to prayers,"I have found Aura Healing Meditations to be a loving healing tool--the next best thing to prayers that I have found. I was very grateful to be able to give this wonderful CD as a gift to a relative who I had just learned was recouperating from surgery. Cynthia Sue Larson's voice is full of wisdom, her tone is gentle, encouraging, loving, and inspiring. I love the way her words float on an ocean of soothing music to fill me and the room with the energy of healing love. I smile so widely each time I see the photo on the inside of the case too--a real treat. I recommend this CD with all my heart!"
5,Energetic Pick-Me-Up,"Aura Healing Meditations is a wondrous inspiration that speaks to the whole being. Guided by the voice of Cynthia Sue Larson, whose compassionate voice cuts through all concerns and stimulates relaxation immediately, the listener is reminded of energetic essence. Richard Hiersch creates a soft musical backdrop for sinking in to healing. Each of the three meditations can be used alone with rejuvenating effects."
3,"64% cotton, 36% polyester - assembled in Mexico","Not all cotton - 64% cotton, 36% polyester - shrunk on first washing - keeps me warm here in Chicago - however still looking for %100 cotton thermals - good price for a quick fix until I can find the all cotton thermal underwear for jogging..."
2,Not very warm,"These thermals are made of waffle fabric, which makes them resemble other thermal pants, but the fabric is very thin. You can clearly see through them.The blend of the fabric is not included in the amazon listing, but it was in the packaging: 65% cotton, 35% polyester."
4,Thermal Underwear,"This item was as advertized, fit well and did not shrink when washed. I would buy again."
4,Good Basic Thermals,"These are the basic waffle or ""grid"" type thermals and are not heavy weight or ""super duty"" by any means. If you are planning a trip across the arctic tundra then ""buck up"" and buy a more expensive type. If however you are like me and just need something a little extra during the winter months to wear under your work pants, then these are just fine indeed. Just don't throw them in the dryer and cook em down a dozen sizes especially if you're kinda tall as they will shrink up to your knees."
2,Good basic product,Met all of its advertised info. I felt they were just average quality. You could probably buy the same item at your local store. The fit they recommended was right on.
2,Very Itchy and poor quality,"Bought the item and upon wearing the pants, it was very itchy. Washed it several time to get rid of it, but it won't goes away. Wouldn't buy it again"
2,.Misleading product info,The product info states that these are cotton. They are actually a cotton polyester blend. I would not have purchased them had I known.
4,Steeler hat,This hat was just perfect because I needed an adjustable hat. It is very durable and comfortable to wear.
2,Too Sweet For Me,"This perfume was too sweet and strong for my taste, and it is definitely not from over-application. My typical perfume application consists of spraying one good time in front of me and then walking through. I will say that the perfume finishes very nicely, but takes a few hours of wear. For reference, I typically wear perfumes that would be classified as light, romantic such as Tiffany."
4,I am so grateful for my sleeping Bag,"I will tell you real fast my story. I bought this because we were going camping for three weeks in sub zero conditions and tons of wind. My companion crew was laughing at my sleeping bag when they saw it because it is a little bulky. They were making all sorts of jokes. Of course joke was on them when they saw it perform.Because of a typo on my behalf I got 2 instead of 1, one of the guys bought it right away when he tried it.The sleep is so cozy. It just changes the entire sleeping under the stars event. I use it often and still very satisfied. Of course as soon as we got back two of my friends logged into amazon to get theirs. :) and they recommend it to everyone. It does get a little humid on the outside but that never penetrates to the inside and it dries fast I've been told that it is normal because of weather conditions and all sleeping bags get that. Hope this helps"
4,Big but warm,"Ok, this thing is giant. But if your car camping who cares. This thing is sooo comfortable and warm you don't even need a sleeping pad, unless you really want. NOT FOR BACKPACKERS. You won't hear your girlfreind complain about how cold it is anymore."
3,Slam Girls: An encore performance for Donna Christy!,"Once again, Pretty Slick Records has taken big talent, and forced it into a small, unworthy concept CD. First, Pretty Slick gave us Vice Girls 34, singing the praises of basketball and the Los Angeles Lakers. This time it's Slam Girls singing about football and the Green Bay Packers. The concept is hackneyed and weak, but the talent is strong. In an encore from Vice Girls 34, producer-engineer-lyricist Donna Christy, who seems to be the consistent talent of Pretty Slick Records, once again amuses us with satire, as the strong lead vocalists belt out her tunes. The vocals performed by Jesse ""Nastee"" Sorrentino, and Ungenita ""Mystery"" make this CD worth a listen."
5,PERFECT!,This is the most fabulous book ever! A CREATIVE friend of mine intimidated me with her incredible party ideas. She purchased this for me for my birthday 9 years ago! I have done almost every theme in the book and LOVE IT!!!!! Everyone has thought the ideas were great and fun. We expanded the ideas a little BUT boy did this jump start my imagination!
2,leaves a lot of questions,"My three-year old loves these kind of dvds. This one has very little explanation of things. For example, you watch a factory making potato chips. It doesn't tell you why they shake the potatoes before frying them (to get the dirt off??) or why they shake them after they fry them (to get the grease off??) or why they are spraying them (to put flavoring / salt on??). That is just one example, but there are questions hanging all through the dvd. If you have an inquisitive toddler like me or you want what your kids watch to have educational value, this dvd is probably not for you. I am not a farmer so I did not know how to answer a lot of the questions. My mom and husband work on a farm and they did not the reasons for why some of the stuff was done in this video. They would love to know the answers to some of my toddlers questions about the dvd."
3,Poor video quality,"I was disappointed with the quality of this video. I knew it was older, but it really did seem like I was watching a vhs tape on a dvd."
4,Another outstanding video from Little Hardhats,"Like the other two videos I own from Little Hardhats (Garbage and Road Construction), this one is excellent. Tons of action with just enough talking to know what's happening, this one is a new favorite for my 3 yr old son. Tilling the soil, planting corn, feeding and milking cows, and many more of the things that go into filling up your lunch bag are covered in fascinating detail.The only thing that keeps this outstanding tape from receiving a five-star rating is the addition of something new to the series of tapes: a five-minute commercial for their other products at the start of the tape. If you're adept at fast-forwarding through the marketing hype, your small children will love this video."
4,It might be just me but...,"My daughter absolutely loves these series and it has been a favorite pick of her selection for over 3 years now (she is now six). I like the ideas of bringing farm life, road construction (isnt that scene where they blow up the mountain great? uhmm what educational value is there in playing it backwards though??? :-), firefighters, house construction etc. to the kids in a format they can easily understand, and yet these video could accomplish so much more I think! For example, the farmer rides his big tractor in the field, and he is doing something obviously, but the narrator does not specify what. My daughter asks ""what is the farmer doing right now, mommy?"" and fortunately i have a vague idea. But in the movie, nobody tells the kid if he is seeding, fertilizing, harvesting grain or bailing straw, which would be a side product of harvesting grains... I'd like these videos to go just a little bit more into details, be instructive in their narrations as well as pictures."
2,A customer From USA was right.,"This book is not for beginners. The author uses terminology without first defining it. The entire first half of the book was extremely confusing. For instance, he author attempts to explain a ""market trend quantifier"" by assigning values to trendlines, exponential moving averages, rsi trix support and resistance areas, and interest rates. He forgot, however, to explain how or who assigns those values to come up with the desired result. Maybe he knows what he is talking about, but he is not a very good teacher or writer."
1,Couldn't help laughing,"Just got a chance for a quick browse. Later in the book, the author complained he offered everyone an ""once in a life time opportunity on a silver platter"": One on one personal training, 1 million dollar capitol, 90% of the profit. But throughout LA, only one person applied?!What's the catch? You have to finish 4 of his courses.Why not complain yourself not coming up with some better sales pitch ^_^"
4,One of the better day trading books,"This is a good book for someone who wants to know more than just the mechanics of electronic day trading. The last 3 chapters are great. The 3rd last chapter shows you tactics. In the 2nd last chapter, the author describes a biomechanical trader. In the last chapter, the author shows you how you should set up your trading work space."
1,do not buy that one,"do not buy that one,....I did not like it att all....very basic and superficial.....waste of time and money"
1,DID NOT RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT.,DID NOT RECEIVE THIS ITEM. RECEIVED A EMAIL FROM VENDOR STATING I WAS TO RECEIVE A CREDIT FOR THE ITEM. HE WAS OUT OF STOCK. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY REFUND OR CREDIT FOR THE ITEM PURCHASED. I AM VERY DISAPOINTED.
2,Okay,"I remember hearing a lot of good things about this game, but I put it in and it was slow even on a modern computer, I'm not sure if it had to do with installing full install or what. But the story is cool. Missions are a tad bit easy. overall a classic though, defiantly gave star craft a run for its money and that is what was around when this came out."
5,Short vowel video,My toddler daughter loves this video! It was recommended by a friend who is an early education teacher. She loves the song and I even heard her trying to sing it! She can identify certain letters now and it definitely keeps her interested. It is a great learning video and I hope there will be a long vowel video in the future.
5,EXCELLENT!! A Must Buy!!!,I recently graduated with a degree in elementary education. One of my professors introduced this DVD to our class. It is an excellent tool for teaching reading. I also used this video in my first grade classroom. The kids were entertained from beginning to end. The children walked away with fifty new sight words that are repeated throughout the video. The short vowel song is very catchy! The kids sing it throughout the day!! I highly recommend this video for beginning readers.
4,Lots of fun.,"Lots of fun. I was playing quickly, but I have some musical experience. The CD does help to learn the songs. All of the songs are simple and easy, but without any words. The wistle is well made for a tin wistle."
2,Imporoper teaching methods,"This DOES NOT teach proper methods for learning the whistle. You don't tongue the whistle like you do western instruments, it is for emphasis only. The songs in the book are not traditional. The whistle is only ok for someone beginning. The coating peels off in a messy way. I spent more and bought at proper book and a better flute. It's worth it in the end."
2,Misses the mark,"This item is somewhat pointless. The book, CD and whistle are all OK, but not the package. The songs on the CD are not labeled and the order does not match the book. If you are good at reading the music or tab in the book you do not need the CD. If you play by ear you do not need the book. I mostly play by ear ( flute, sax, recorder & whistle) but wanted some help with the very fast Irish whistle music. I was on holiday in Ireland at the time & didn't have good internet access.With the internet you can find you tube performances and google the sheet music & tabs."
4,D Day Then and Now,"Certainly not an historical document breaking new theories but extremely well organized, fully documented, and great labeled photos. Great organizational and detailed view on D Day.Detailed and accurate study."
3,Bigger shells better,This box is much more practical for .233 than it any other smaller caliber. I found that .17 and .22 cartridges sit well below the top lip of the container and are harder to pull out individually than a .223. I had to turn the box over to remove smaller cartridges and found that slightly annoying as I would typically get more than a handful.
4,Awesome,"This is a great CD, with some bloody good bands on it. buy it or there will be HELL TO PAY (The business)hahahaha. I AM GOD, WAHAHAHAHAHAHA, oh wellcyaMay the force be with you"
5,Awesome,This message of song will transform your spirit to come to realization that you are in the presence of the Lord. I have been truly inspired to understand my relationship with the Lord. It taps into your soul to want to glorify the Lord in a personal fashion. You will be truly blessed by each song.
3,Michelangelo video,"This is basically an overview, not great detail about the artist, which would take a lot more time than this. I already knew most of what was presented, but there is good video and I did learn a couple of things."
3,A good overview,"The study provides some interesting data from recent history as well as some forecasts on the future of the industry. The study appears well structured and presents well. However, some of the simplifying assumptions and limitations of study make it less useful than a more exhaustive analysis. The authors, to their credit, do make clear what these assumptions and limitations are. In short, it's a good, quick overview of the industry and could make for a useful primer."
3,the derek trucks band/ songlines,what a bunch of great talent on one stage. Derek trucks is just simply awesome.
1,POOREST SERVICE YET TO RECEIVE ORDER SINCE 8/17/09,I'm yet to receive my book. This is the worst service I've ever received. I can't get anybody to respond to me from Amazon. Please SEND my book or give me REFUND.
5,how do you rate a class text?,"this is required reading for a class that I am taking. Since it is required - the text could be considered perfect - without it I would be unable to complete the class.Other than that, the book is well organized, thorough, and dense with information. A good text."
4,A must read for the layman and the professional.,"Prof. Falvo has produced a book that clearly outlines not only the medical concerns, but the very real psychological aspects of chronic illness that are frequently misunderstood. Specific examples are used throughout the book and it is quite readable to someone who is not a medical professional like myself. The author shares her insights and experience to provide the groundwork for trying new approaches.The book also cites numerous references for someone who is interested in pursuing additional research. I can certainly recommend it for anyone interested in the topic."
3,Doesn't look as pretty with the set as the sheet,"That comes with the bedding set. I hope they start carrying the other verision back online soon, as now you can only get it in stores."
4,Good background music,We like it for background music while opening gifts or visiting with guests. It's good instrumental music and appropriate for entertaining.
3,Lego Set,"The plastic box was less than half filled with the legos, but it did contain the windows and doors, which was what I wanted. Probably it would have been less expensive if I could have just purchased the blocks I wanted without the box."
2,"Big Box, Little Fun","The over one hundred pieces it advertises sounds like a lot, and as big as the container is you would think it is a lot. My son was very disappointed when he opened the box and the legos barely covered the bottom of the blue bin. Fun to build small things, but that is about all you get out of it. Definately not worth the price."
1,Pieces missing,"Received order with pieces missing, grandson was very unhappy. I told my daughter to call into Lego's headquarters and let them know so they could send the pieces out to my grandson as soon as possible."
5,legos!,Who doesn't get excited about legos? It is the perfect gift for any boy - even the older ones. They play with these all the time!
5,Lego Fun,My 4 year old great-grandson has a great time figuring out what character or building to build.
1,Why don't I get it?,"It seems like most people understand this book, I cannot even begin to grasp it! I don't know why but for me it's seemingly written in another language. My professor makes sense in class but when I try to do the reading on my own it's the most frustrating experience I've ever had with a book. Clearly, it's not for everyone!"
3,just a standard ice tea mix,"This is an OK sugar free Ice Tea, but use it to 3/4 gallon per powder cup or it comes out too bland. If you prefer Splenda as a sweetener, try Arizona Beverage which taste the same as Crystal Light which uses controversial Nutrasweet sweetener. I drink a Gallon of water with sugar free drink mix per day. Crystal Light loses 1 star for using a cheap old sweetener, loses another star for being expensive."
2,"Disappointed with music. I heard an excerpt on the radio, but that was the only part I really liked","Music was alright, but somewhat routine. Not something I would keep in my collection. Music was ok, but nothing special"
3,fair product!,This video is obviously an older video...the gerenal conscepts are present and able to understand for the most part as long as you are already somewhat familiar with braiding. If you aren't familiar with how to braid this is probably not what you are looking for. I purchased this for my daughter so she could learn ADDITIONAL braiding techniques and for that purpose it does the trick. Fair-Good product.
5,A Must Buy,"This video is a must for any true fan of the incredibly unique talent of the tenors that ruled during the post WWII years;particularly DiStefano and Corelli.Although DiStefano is a bit past his prime,it is a marvel to actually see him sing.His unique style and that velvet voice are sorely missed today.I only wish there were more live video of this incredible tenor when he was truly in his vocal prime.Franco Corelli will never be replaced in the opera house.His voice is simply booming on this video.The ease with which he belts out endless ringing high notes is nothing short of spectacular.His physical appearance is unlike any other tenor and certainly commands respect;I would not want him mad at me!This video is a true treasure and just confirms how far we've sunk with our current ""talent"" Cura,Bocelli,etc."
3,Needed a rain gauge,This is a little flowery for me. It is just a rain gauge and it will surely do what it is suppose to do. It arrived in just a few days as promised. It is larger than I thought it would be and I am a little disappointed in the looks of it.
4,puzzled,"fun puzzle that my kindergartener sister likes as well as me, a 6th grader. Different shaped pieces that you put together to make the puzzle, like a do-able rubic cube."
5,Great for kids!!!,"This game was a great present for my nieces and nephews, it made them use their minds in an imaginative way, great for on the go or sitting inside on a cold day. And it got them away from their video games! They all really liked it and they had fun racing each other though the puzzles."
3,Hits Roll Down,"This is a really good album in which in its time before all the later ""Best Of"" releases made this obsolete. So really, it is a good record. There is a added CD to the special edition that contain remixes but really, not the big attraction here. check the album out but remember there are other releases with more of a selection of tracks on it. Still it is packed with real good songs. Check out my website sometime and google ""judemac Forever""."
4,it does work,"I have owned this for about 4 months now, has been used 2 or 3 times. So far it has withstood my kids (ages 3 and 7) playing with it (and yes, jumping on it some) just fine. They both enjoy sleeping on it, though it seems to inflate higher on the ends than in the middle, which makes it sort of have a ""dip"" in the middle. It looks uncomfortable to me, but the kids both say it's great.Foot pump is pretty puny and slow. It was quicker just to blow it up myself."
3,it's ok-- not practical for roling sleepers!,My 3 year old slept on it a few times and rolled rigt off of it-- ended up on the floor anyways. Design of item is nice. She liked it for that.
4,History of the Battleship Arizona,Nice detailed reference on the battleship Arizona. Detailed history. Very useful collection of pictures. Great reference for modelers.
2,"Poor Spice Mix, Disappointing","I tried Carroll Shelby's Chili Kit earlier this week, and it was excellent. I tried this one tonight using the same cuts of meat and was very disappointed. This one was peppery enough but seemed to lack cumin and garlic. Firey, but bland - thin tasting, not rich."
5,Hamilton Beach 47334 BREWSTATION PRO,"Been very happy with the coffee maker. Unlike other people said they had problems with it, so far so good after 2 months. Went and bought the hamilton beach filter basket again unlike other people fits the way it should have no problems, been very happy and would reccommend."
2,Makes a great cup of coffee for a few months,"We have had four Hamilton Beach Brewstations, all 12-cup capacity. We love the cup of coffee they make, the way it's kept warm without scortching, and most of all, the ease of using only one hand to fill our coffee cups. The frustrating thing is that these Brewstations, at least the four we've owned (all different 12-cup models, highest end) begin to leak like a sieve after about a year of use, if that. It's getting expensive and we're looking for another manufacturer."
3,LEAKS ARE NOT MY FAULT!,"After buying model 48465, I noticed leaking. Called the company, was supposed to get a new base for a nominal fee, but they sent the carafe part instead. I then had to call to get the base. So basically I got a whole new coffemaker, and guess what, that one leaked too. I think I called them yet again, but i can't remember now. I told my bf to research it cuz he drinks the most coffee, but I don't think he did so we just live with having to deal with it. I certainly did not put in in a dishwasher, nor did I immerse it or ""move it around."" It's quite obviously a manufacturer defect. I have model 48465. I was psyched when I bought this cuz I'm a klutz and would probably break a carafe, but the leaking is a pain. I'm pretty insulted that other reviewers would blame the consumer instead of Hamilton Beach, because it's obviously an ongoing thing. Would I buy another one? Despite it all, I would, especially since the older models couldn't accommodate a travel mug and mine can."
3,it is okay.,"One must be careful when filling a cup. Unless the cup is pushed hard against the coffee trigger, coffee will spill. Also, a small light that turns on when filling the cup so one can see how much coffee pours into the cup."
5,My second Hamilton Beach Pro,"This is my second Hamilton Beach Pro. the first one lasted me for more than 3 years ...it was fantastic.i drink a ton of coffee in the morning - it is super easy to set up the timer so that when i wake, the coffee has already been brewed. Plus it all stays inside the compartment - and stays warm for 2-3-4 hrs based on your setting.it makes upto 12 cups - so really useful when we have people over (which is quite often). needs occassional descaling - you can get the packets via amazon too."
2,"TOO SLOW, AND COFFEE DOESN'T STAY WARM","I've had this for one year. It doesn't keep the coffee warm for more than a couple of hours after brewing. As it has gotten older, it takes longer to make the coffee. I'm always waiting for it to get finished."
2,Just average,"I purchase a new maker about every two years. It brews good coffee. It is relatively easy to clean. However, it DOES leak. It will ruin your counter tops if you are not careful. I will definitely not purchase this maker again."
2,Ours was a Leaker,"It appears from the varying comments that some units leak and some do not... might be a quality control issue, or perhaps made in a different facility. This was our third Brew Station ... have loved them ! This newer unit seemed perfect now that everyone is using travel mugs and the taller dispenser seemed perfect.However, from the first time we turned it on (using only water and no coffee to first familiarize ourselves with the new programming options), it left a puddle... tired again ... again a puddle. Thinking we'd overfilled it, used half-a-tank ... still a puddle. I didn't equate it with the spout positioning, but question if the tank itself has a hidden leak .. but it's obviously a problem for many. Returning it... will try a different model.Has to be SOME reason Hamilton Beach is constantly revamping the model. The original model is still functioning in a vacation house, after years of no issues at all. Would have purchased another of those if still available!"
2,**It Leaks,"My husband bought this brew station 4 months ago to replace the older one that did not keep the cofffee hot. Just after 1 month it started leaking leaving coffee under the unit and on my counter tops. I got tired of putting paper towel in the front to catch the drips when getting a cup of coffee, and constantly checking for leaks under the unit. I went back to my 12 cup Farberware percolator and I know my cofee is made fast and stays real hot."
2,Disappointing,I was at first thoroughly in love with this coffee maker. That lasted for about 4 months until it started to leak. A slow drip at first and within a few days I could only make one cup of coffee at a time and had to keep a mug on the drip pan at all times. The entire amount of coffee brewed would leak out. Unfortunately I did not realize how bad it was at first and had quite a large mess to clean up. I ended up with almost 2 full cups of coffee on my counter and none to drink. Not a pleasant way to start the work day. I won't own another one.
1,THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN,"This movie looks like something a highschool kid made out of his home. Don't waste your money!! I was upset that I even spent the money to rent this!! The acting, plot, dialogue...everything is horrible about this movie!! I would have given it less stars if it was possible!!!"
1,Worst movie EVER,"I am a big fan of Troma and indie movies in general. I own close to 100 b-movies. I have seen countless low budget films.I consider this to be the WORST (not funny bad - UNWATCHABLE) movie I have ever seen.I can handle low / no production values. I handle porn-level acting. But, this story was so filled with plot canyons. To describe them as plot holes would be an injustice.Buy this movie for someone you despise and wish to harm."
5,Great heating pads.,I have a number of cats and a lot of cat beds. I've been volunteering at a cat shelter for 9 years so cats come and go in my house. But the one thing they all like are heated beds. I live in Seattle and they get used almost year round.Recently some of the heating elements in my pet beds have died. I purchased these to replace them. I also like the fact that with these heating pads I can turn any pet bed into a heated bed.I've been using these for a couple of weeks now and the beds they are in are always occupied so these are a success!I definitely recommend these heating pads.
4,Its small,Product is well made and looks good. It is quite small and Iwould get a larger one if possible. Also not real strong so thatthe cat needs to lay directly on it to feel the warmth.
3,works fine... but my dog does not like,"I bought this for my 15 year old short hair pointer. She is always cold in the winter. Now that she is so old, I thought she would love having a warm spot. But she has not sat on her bed since I put the warmer in it. I think the plastic smell that it gave off the first few days caused her to dislike it. It has now been plugged in for 2 weeks, and no longer smells, but still no use. I am about ready to call it a mistake and unplug it."
4,Petmate heat pad maybe too warm,The pad appears to be well made. A little warmer than it should be. We put it under a pretty thick layer. It's effective.
2,The Plug on the item is not as pictured,"One of the reasons that I purchased this pad is due to the type of plug that the picture indicates that it has on it. From appearance it would look to be some sort of safety or GFI-like plug that would ""pop off"" in the event of an overheat or electrical issue. When I opened the box the item actually has a simple two-pronged plug. As I look back at the fine print of the description, the item does indicate that it has a ""two prong plug"". The item in the picture is indeed two pronged, but it also has a pop on/off type switch in the picture. The item does not have this feature.My dog does like the heating pad (5.5lb chihuahua), however, I am a bit concerned about leaving it on while unattended. The GFI/Safety plug would have been a nice feature that would have justified the higher price. I can not recommend this as it is most assuredly not worth the price. A heating pad would be cheaper."
5,Great product,My 15 lb dog loves this in her bed! She loves getting in her bed & having the covers all warm. Once she is in & all curled up she does not want to get out.
3,heating pad for sick cat,Can't tell that it is working. It does not say which button turns it on! So I tried it different ways. Do not feel any heat.
2,Quality control issues,I have bought 4 of these pads in the past few years. 2 of them failed within 1 year. One of them became so hot that the rubber cover began to burn. Luckily the cat was not on it at the time. The other simply stopped heating. They have a 1-year warranty but the postage to mail them back makes this a losing proposition. This is now a Made in China item and the quality of the product reflects that. Better to find a more expensive replacement that will last longer.
3,OKAY,"My dogs uses it. Often find her in her crate just to get the heat during these colder winter months. However, it's not very hot.. Provide a very luke warm heat."
5,My cat loves this,The heating pad is a replacement for a cat bed heater. Solid cord protector - even for a kitten. Sasha loves the heater. Even likes it upside down.
3,Cats love it!,"Our cats love this bed heater! We put it in their small beds and cover it with a thin towel. All three of our cats LOVE this heater.We've had two of these heaters for about 9 months and they were both working fine until recently. About 1 month ago one of the bed heaters stopped working reliably. There must be a wiring issue, since if I jiggle the wire at both ends sometimes it will come back on. This is unfortunate, as the cats love the heater. We are going to order another and hope that it won't have this same problem.Rating for the product when it works -- 5 stars.Pricing - This price is currently way too expensive at $30. It's a heating element w a plug, why is it priced so high? When I got this 9 months ago it was $19 from Amazon. I don't know why the price has increased 50% ?? Definitely reduces the product rating due to price/value.Bottom line for me - I will buy another one when the price is more reasonable."
2,Worked well but did not last as long as I wanted,I really liked this heating pad but mine did not last very long only about 6 months before it stopped working! I would buy something else if I were you.
4,Nice small warmer,Great little pad for my hedgehog cage. Just enough heat to keep it warm.The device uses 10 watts and not the advertised 4.Also mine did NOT come with the GFCI (the kind with the reset right on the cord). It just has a regular two prong plug.
3,Changed a great product.,This is the second one of these we purchased because we really liked the first one. We use them in our cat condo/towers for our Burmese short hair cats to use in the winter. We liked the fact that the plug in the wall had a switch that turned the heater heater on or off if you weren't using it. When we got another one for our other cat they changed the unit and there is no turn-off switch. You have to unplug it from the wall. A real inconvenience since it's plugged in behind other furniture. Try to find another brand that has the on/off switch on the on cord.
2,lasted less than 6 mos.,"Had two of these. One lasted about 3 mos, the other almost 6 mos. My dogs are both small and older so there was no problems with them destroying or damaging them. I'm hoping that the next generation one is better - it has a hard backing that prevents it from bunching up."
3,The Mortal Hero,"I read the Iliad and thought that this book would be useful but it was not extremely useful and the book didn't come during the time it was supposed to come. The book was brand new and in perfect condition, which it should have been anyways."
5,Great book!,"This is a great book that everyone considering Wheaton should get their hands on! I am so glad to have found a guide book that brings student perspectives into play. I find that so often the reviews of schools only give information about academics and the like, but there is so much more involved in campus life, and you generally never get that information. It was great to know the student perspective on the drug scene, diversity, and even something as seemingly unimportant as weather. The thing is, all of these things ARE important because they make up the culture. College is not just about writing papers or doing experiments and it's good to know where you're really going before you get there!"
2,Dissapointment,"I thought for sure Kanye West would give this the same time and hard work that he gave Common's BE. I was wrong.The good the bad and the ugly has been out for 4 years already. Pay for the flight wasn't even on this CD. What a dissapointment! Grammy Family? Please! That was released last year already! Cons, do you think we are stupid? C'mon, man!"
5,Solid Album,"There are a few fillers here along with two re-released tracks, but all in all its a real GOOD, easy listen. People say Cons sounds like Kanye, but its actually the other way around, as Consequence is the artist who shaped and molded West into the rapper he is today.Amazing production on this album, and it is a real solid major label debut for the veteran Queens rapper."
4,Lived up to my hopes!,"Excellent blade! Does a very smooth cut when ripping.Glue line cut? Yes, with qualifications. Any rip cut is effected by type of wood, feed speed, wood density, grain direction, etc. If everything is right, the cut is as smooth as if it was planed. If anything is off then you can still see saw marks. Mind you there are less saw marks than when usinf a standard rip saw.Also, makes a smooth cross-cut saw - better that most combination saws. Quite a pleasant surprise, that.Highly recomended!"
5,Good and Entertaining,"I read this book when it was published under the title ""Fool's Gold"" (published 1983). I found his narrative gripping. I felt like I was there. I grew up in the Phoenix area, so It was even more of a intense feeling because I have been in the Supersititon mountains and can say that he is right. Those mountains are rugged, harsh, and you get a sense of it being a little creepy. The book is well written and well researched. I reccomend it strongly to anyone who is interested in the legends and tales of the West."
5,Factual look at one of the west enduring legends.,"Like another reviewer, I read this book when it was entitled Fools Gold. The book gives a detailed, factual account of the Lost Dutchman's Mine Legend. The author describes his personal experiences working with those that have searched for the mine. He also includes quite a bit of original historical research on the history of the legend and on Jacob Waltz (the Dutchman). He intersperses these perspectives throughout the book. It is a very interesting book to read even if you are marginally interested in this topic.The author does a good job of debunking the legend. If you have any doubts about whether the mine exists you probably won't after reading this book. The evidence clearly indicates that the Dutchman's Mine is fiction, not fact."
3,"Some things are better remembered, than relived.","The packaging is well done. Transcription to new media excellent. The end result is less than priceless.The music is as flat as it was on 78's or AM radio. As technology has evolved are tastes change. By the standards of fifty years ago the recordings are very good but we've come to expect more, ""The Duke"" is a disappointment. Most of my listening to music is done on a high end CD player in my car. The player brings out the ""tinny-ness"" of recording technology of the past. It's not pleasant listening and it soon will end up parked on a shelf and forgotten. The ""good old days"" really were not."
2,Commercial grade lights not LED,"I was looking for LED lights to purchace and thought that is what I had just bought . The comercial grade somehow got into the mix and that ia what I ordered. It is my fault, read and understand befor you buy. I would have returned them but didn't know what I had for a while."
3,Nice if they last.............,"GE lights are better quality than many of the ""cheapo"" brands. That said, I have bought MANY sets of ""Christmas"" or ""Holiday"" lights over the past 8 years. I have an outdoor hot-tub and I keep lights up year round because I enjoy the festive feel and the low light ambiance. I have purchased quite a few of the GE ""Professional"" line of holiday lights; most last less than a year before at least PART of the light strand goes out. I do not quite understand how it happens that part of the light strand will remain functional and part will be totally out (40-50 of the lights) ............. so definitely not a fuse issue. Anyway, I keep buying them (Amazon and KMart) because they are better than the ultra cheapo varieties that are so common. If you are using yours indoors only and only for a month or so at a time, maybe you will have better luck."
1,just finished putting these lights up,"I keep berry garland in my great room year round and just changed to new garland and so i bought these GE commercial grad extra large lights so that everything would be new. I bought these at Lowes because I needed them quickly and it said COMMERCIAL grade, thinking they will last forever. I bought two boxes with 150 lights in each box and as I am putting up the 2nd strand they keep blinking. Called my husband for support and he said there is a bad wire in the 2nd strand!!!! I just opened the box 2 hours ago. REALLY!!! I also have had walmart lights and didn't have this happen with them. SO DISAPPOINTED in this COMMERCIAL grade!!! Go to walmart!"
1,cool verus warm led lights,"GE s#cks on their labeling the led light boxes. Very easy to mix when buying ""Warm"" or ""Cool"" LED lights. The only indication is a VERY SMALL note on the box. The warm lights are yellow and the cool light are a blue tint. They do not mix.Big pain in A##. Had to take them down after the install because the two types don't match. Got my money back at Lowes."
4,Good introduction to family systems applied to congregations,"The latest book to apply family systems to the congregation is Healthy Congregations, by Peter Steinke, a student of the late Rabbi Edwin Friedman. Steinke approaches his subject positively - how do healthy congregations behave?Congregational health begins with mature, self-differentiated leaders. Leaders in an anxious system (as all systems are, from time to time) must avoid becoming overly concerned with solving others' problems or assuaging their anxiety. Anyone who has served in congregational leadership knows how difficult this can be. Steinke holds out the faith that leaders who model good immune functioning can in time be the ""salvation"" of their congregations.Steinke's account of congregational maladies ring true, and his prescriptions are pragmatic. Healthy Congregations is a worthy sequel to Steinke's previous Alban volume, How Your Congregational Family Works.Dan Hotchkiss, senior consultant for the Alban Institute"
3,Good overview of the way a church functions in terms of systems theory,"I have a masters (MS) in Systems Theory applied to computer systems and educational systems. The title of the book caught my eye since I had never seen the systems approach used to explain or predict or manipulate organizations as churches. Very good overview but a bit simplistic and subjective. I expected a bit more objectivity from the label ""a systems approach"". Definitely not written for those with expertise on systems theory."
3,Healthy Congregations: A systems Approach,"Unfortunately, the item arrived too late. I paid for a 2 day delivery and didn't receive it on time. Our church Council had a retreat at my home and we wanted to use this book as a reference. The book arrived days after the retreat."
2,average,The material contained in this book is redundant with so many others with the focus on increasing the health (spirit and activism) of the congregation.
2,A Poor Approach,"This book has a flawed approach, I assume from Steinke's credentials that he knows something about congregational conflict, but almost all his evidence for why and how things function come from the analogous relationship between a congregation and a humand body. Now the bible does make that analogy, but too think that the apostle Paul was thinking about viruses and cells and such when he was making that analogy is silly. There are some good things in this book, but nothing worth spending an hour or two to read this book. And people who are of a more Evangelical persuation will be annoyed with some aspects of this book."
3,Very Basic Introduction to Sytemic Health,"Steinke presents the reader with a very basic introduction to understanding and approaching congregational health from a systems approach. This work is by no means academic. However, for anyone not yet familiar with congregational systems dynamics this may very well be a good introduction.I do like the chart on page 11, venturing to suggest that it views a congregation's health from a systems perspective in a very postmodern manner. Congregations embracing and/or struggling with postmodernity would benefit from this visual regarding systemic health.The section about leaders being like the immune system of an organism (the congregation) certainly piqued my interest. However, likely due to the introductory nature of this work, I was disappointed in the depth to which Steinke explored this postulation."
4,Good and readable,A very interesting analysis of family systems theory that draws heavily on other organic systems and examples from biology to talk about relational dynamics within congregations.
4,Good for church study,"I ordered this book because my small Pres. church was studying theapplication of Family Systems theory to congregations, so this bookcovered the same ground as our meetings but in an accessible andwell written format. Our church leader was working on this subjectfor his D.Min. degree, so he was well informed about the field, butthis book enabled me to review our meetings and think through howits insights might apply locally."
5,Help for Anxious Churches and Church Leaders,"Steinke's Healthy Congregations begins where his first volume, ""How Your Church Family Works,"" left off. He presents ten principles of health, how to deal with corporate anxiety, and the role of spiritually and emotionally healthy leaders in influencing the church's emotional competence. Of particular value is his discussion of Infectious Anxiety (pp. 55-67), where problems such as murmuring, gossip, secrets, accusations, and triangulation are discussed."
3,"works fine, just as advertised",Installation was quick and easy. Was a bit of a challenge to understand how to set the range since there were no instructions so had to do it by try and retry.
2,What happened to this guidebook?,"Lonely Planet has taken an interesting turn with this edition: drastically cut the content and quality and increase the price! Because I spend a lot of time in the southwest, I buy every new edition when it comes out. I'll be looking for something else now. What happened, Lonely Planet??"
1,Great Lupe Music in Bad CD!,"...If you, like me, lived through La Lupe's era, you know that this album is one of her best... We were waiting a long time for the CD to come out so that we could enjoy this excellent work in all its ""digitally remastered"" glory... But not such a luck.The record company has released a product that is not even worthy of the worst bootleggers out there... Believe it or not this CD sounds like they took an old vinyl LP and transfered it to CD using home equipment... This was certainly NOT done from the original masters...So, if you are tempted to spend [money] on this my advice is ""save your money or give it to charity""...Continue playing your old LP which is probably in much better condition than the one they used for this horrible CD..."
2,A reminder for the rude,"Since you've been instructed by brainwashed fanboys not to read my long review, let me sum it up for you.- HARD TO PUT TOGETHER- WON'T EVEN STAY TOGETHER- BREAKS IN MINUTES FLAT- COMPLETELY NOT WORTH it.Again, the commercials and TV series make these toys seem awesome, but it's not the case. They're a good idea but are about as durable as tissue paper, and I've yet to buy a single one whose stickers didn't fall off seconds after I put them on.Know what? Go ahead and buy the product, since the advertising has done such a good job of burning the idea into kids' minds that these toys are fun, but IF YOU CAN THINK FOR YOURSELF you'll see that they're absolutely not worth your time and money."
1,B-Daman Battle Basic Figure,"When they say ""Ready, Set, B-da fire!"", they should really say: ""Load up your plastic tinker toy, and shoot a marble for two and a half feet!""All you can do with the B-Daman is shoot marbles. Your B-Daman will frequently fall apart. The accuracy cannon that only makes the shot less powerful, but doesn't increase the toy's accuracyI personally think the ad for B-Daman was photoshopped, because if you actually buy it, the marble never goes as fast as the ad says it will. The ad is just an exaggeration to get more people to buy the toy. But if you can manage to get it to shoot faster and not fall apart so frequently, then it might have some value. Definitely 1 star."
3,Decoying Big Game,"More about other item's than actually decoying deer, some useful information though. If I'd taken a look at it at a store I proibably would nbot have bought."
3,Decoying Big game,Good book-a little disappointing in content.Was looking forward to more ways to set up decoys and different methods to make decoying work better(small part of book).Had A lot of good adventure stories told by the Author from his personel hunts.Any good hunter nows about hunting with the wind and using it to their advantage.Best asset was the computer links to different sports/business contacts.Enjoyable-yet unfulfilling.
4,Nice Overview,A good systematic description of Tewa dances and performances. This work is a neat overview of the various dances as carried out in the Tewa villages of northern New Mexico. Sweet's analysis is informed by her working relations among Pueblo people. The recent edition includes contemporary testimonies of Pueblo people who continue to navigate and balance their culture within (and outside) the tourism and art industry.
3,"Interesting photos, but more tourist manual","I was looking for more insight into the dances of the Tewa people. You do get some insight here but it still feels like you are an outsider. There is alot of general information here like the outer reason for a dance, where it is, generally when, but that's about it. Yes there are a few nice photos. But I was looking for more insight into the mythology behind the origin of the dances and the specific elements on the costumes. That is not here. In the end it reads like a travel guide for the dances and not anything mystical (which is what I wanted)."
5,Litte,This book is easy to understand. No need to be an expert in letters.I would recommend this book for anyone who are interesting in reading a good book that talk and explains certain litterature art.
2,Not a good selection.,"Of all the English textbooks I've read, this has to be the worst. I had an assignment to pick any short story I wanted out of it to write an essay over and realized just what a terrible selection there was! All the authors chosen are very obscure and when I went to read their works, they were extremely mundane and I understood why I had never heard of them before."
5,A delicious way to cook a cake and share a story!,"This book is wonderful!! A friend showed me the book and I have ordered several copies since then. It makes great wedding presents, shower gifts and all occasion gift. I have met the ""cake lady"" and she is as funny as her book! I can't wait until her next book arrives. The cakes are simple to make and she shares entertaining hints with each cake. It is a wonderful read and cookbook!!"
3,The solution to the flops,"I have now made the coconut carrot cake, the carrot cake and the gem cake. They all turned out well and I have used adaptations of them for wedding cakes and special event cakes in my catering business.I have a tip for anyone who is making any cake from any recipe - do not use all-purpose flour - use cake flour for cakes. Using cake flour will make all the flops work out much better. I found the gem cake a bit on the eggy side (4 eggs will do that) but once I iced with a homemade whipped cream based icing and real strawberries it was fine.What I've noticed about this and many other cookbooks is that there is an assumption made by the author that people know what they are doing in the kitchen. Since often this is not the case I would recommend that folks read: The Cake Bible first and perhaps another book about cakes from scratch. Then read this book and only using real cake flour make the cakes that seem interesting to you."
5,The best cookbook for cakes I have ever seen.,"My best friend and I were in Charleston and saw this book at Hoppin John's (another great cook). She is from Chicago and told me that she had baked every cake in this book. The Milk Chocolate cake tastes just like a candy bar and the best part of all the recipes are very down-to-earth, just like grandma's instructions. The authors remarks about each recipe and her love of baking makes it a great addition to your collection. I am planning on giving several as gifts this Xmas."
2,"Beautiful book, but the recipes...","When this book arrived, I had trouble putting it down. It's such fun to read. I bake often, & my friends really enjoy my cakes. (I'm not a baking novice.) I tried 3 recipes from this book. Two were flops, & one was mediocre. The chocolate chip cake, & Charlston chews were gooey in the middle long after the suggested bake time. The buttermilk coffee cake was nothing special. I'd buy a different book."
1,How disappointing! She relies on mixes.,"If you are looking for special cake recipes for special occasions, I would not recommend this book. All of the recipes in one way or another rely on a variety of mixes. I was very disappointed! There are other cake books which are much more worthy."
3,Mother Gong - 'Wild Child' (Spalax) 3 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1991, 'Wild Child' looks to be Mother Gong's sixth effort. Not bad for a side project of Gong space whisper goddess Gilli Smyth, while having some help from from fellow Gong member Harry Williamson and sax player Robert Calvert (not the Hawkwind poet). Basically, just good free spirited hippie rock. Plus, Smyth's cosmic poetry doesn't hurt. Best cuts here are ""Between Us"", ""Child"", ""Room 1"" and the eleven-minute ""Balein"". Don't you love this CD's cover? Would possibly make a good wall painting."
1,Disappointing,I ordered this one but I got a way different one. I received its a BOY. It was to late to send it back for what I needed it for. I called and never got a response.
3,Bulkhead fitting,"If i had read a little more carefully i would have noticed that connections to this product are solvent weld not threads. If i were advertising this product i would make sure to specify that fact and to point out that the threads are NOT iron pipe (NPT). Service,product and delivery very good."
2,"delivered on time, but over charge for shipping.","the seller charged almost 4 times more for shipping. Sent the complaint to the seller, but there has been no response."
5,Over 100+ Execises That Help You Grow Spiritually,"This is an outstanding book for many different reasons. First, I have never seen a book like this that gives you so many tools to help you grow spiritually. The Exercise I like best is the HU. I have used it many times when in need of protection, for insight, advancing myself spiritually, etc... It is without a doubt the most useful spiriutal tool I have ever used. Not to mention, all the other terrific exercises the author gives. I called Eckankardirectly and bought the Hu/CD and play it all the time when I am driving or in my home. It will change your life and so will this incredible book full of wonderful exercises. A great value and indispenable resource. A must read!"
5,Assuages Your Spiritual Longing,"I cannot imagine, if you are a committed and sincere spiritual seeker, that you will not find some of these exercises extremely useful. Choose the ones most in tune with your intuition, and invite them into your consciousness like lifelong friends. There is a universality about these exercises that seems to touch the pristine heart of everyone I know who has seriously worked with them. If you have a thrist for spiritual adventure, come aboard. Bon voyage!"
2,GOOD STUFF,"This is good live stuff, but I would kiss a truck stop toilet seat to be able to purchase this bands first three studio releases."
1,"NOT THE ORIGINAL ""FAME"" !! THIS IS A REMAKE !!","I bought this for my wife's birthday. We discovered later, to her great disappointment, that this is a remake of the original ""Fame"" and not as good, not what she expected, not what I thought I had bought. So, note for you -THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL ""FAME"" !!"
2,I won't remember your names...,"This is a sad excuse for a movie. It was pretty edgy for a PG and I didn't really get caught up in the characters' lives. It didn't connect with me at all. If you are looking for any music from the original film here, just skip it. There are only TWO songs from the original FAME movie. Don't even think about watching this!"
1,Fame remake not worth the time,"I recently borrowed the film from my public library and didn't think much of it. I didn't find that you got to know anything about any of the characters in the film which is the complete opposite of the original film's plot. So, I can't recommend this film at all."
2,Poor imitation of original film,What a disappointment. The youger cast was untalented while the older cast was under utilized. The music was forgettable and the dancing was only so-so. There were no standout performances and no credible plot. Skip this film and get the original Fame instead...now that was a fun film!
4,My 12 year old prefers this version rather than the original,"Although my 12 year prefers this version and I prefer the original, we both love and prefer the TV version: seasons one and two overall. There are no bad words in the TV versions and the scripts are excellent with a lot of old style life lessons to be learned. So parents get the TV versions for your younger kids to watch now and later let them decide whether they want to watch the movie versions when they are in middle school or high school."
1,Just God-awful,"A terrible film. Rancid ""plot"" that doesn't even bother, full of cliches from twenty years ago. I'd give no stars if I could."
4,"good movie, but it's too cliche....","it's no where spectacular like the original and will most likely be forgettable in months to come. it's just like any other dance flick out there..honey, save the last dance, step up, etc. it brings nothing new to the table, but it was a nice little movie to watch."
4,Good buy!,"There was tiny bit of damage done to the cover, but other than that the disc was unharmed and the movie is great!"
2,"""Lame Fame""!",This film left me longing for the original 1980 film starring Irene Cara. High expectations with such a great cast...too bad the film didnt deliver!
3,"Great Technicality, poor character development",I suppose it might be difficult to have everything in this movie. The development of the characters was well underdone. You really did not get a sense of where they came from and who they really where. Once in school however the movie's energy changed to a high note. This showcased the development of the artist and the grueling atmosphere that they had to go through to improve their craft. My suggestion is to rent it unless you want to pair it with the original in your library.Rich
5,Russell Dri-Power shirt,These shirts are great. They are light weight and come out of the dryer looking perfect. They don't take up much space in the drawer and are cool on hot days. They don't wrinkle and the color does not fade. These are ideal easy care work out shirts.
3,Quick Dry Technology always top-notch,"The shirt utilizes the quick dry technology very well. It keeps you fairly cool; however, you can find packs of 2 or 3 for the same price. The medium is slightly larger than one may be expecting and I believe this will hold for other sizes as well."
5,As Noted & Requested,I enjoy the texture of the T and the coaching shorts; lighter and feeling of more preparation being done for workout than cotton T.
4,Great moisture wicking shirt for the price!,"This is a great shirt for the price. You can buy the same shirt from Nike, Adidas or Under Armor at Dicks or Sports Authority for $25 to $30. It may not have a swoosh or Adidas symbol on the chest, but the quality is just as good. I was just looking for a good light shirt to hit the gym in or jog in and this is perfect. I purchased 2 shirts and took advantage of the free Super Saver Shipping, $30 total. That's a good deal.I'm 6'-0"", 190 lbs and athletic. The large fits me just fine. If you have a belly you will want to go a size up. The torso length and sleeve length are dead on in my opinion.This is a good light weight shirt, perfect for exercising in hot weather."
2,Sizes have been changed!,"Sometimes the XXL were a little confining while exercising, so I tried these in XXL. They were HUGE!!! I washed them in hot water a few times and they are still way too big. I then ordered XXL which were the original size I wore and they too are way too big. I haven't lost enough weight to account for the size change. It seems Russell has once again started to screw with their sizing. It may get to the point that I quit buying their products, online anyway."
1,Not made like it used to be,"I bought several of these dry fit shirts last year and love them. They WERE high quality, very comfortable and a good value. Unfortunately, it appears that new ones are completely different and just like the Starter brand that is sold in Walmart. The quality is nowhere near what it was: the seams are not well sewn, there is a gray bead of material along the inside back of the collar that is NOT comfortable and the fit is not the same. Just not very well made.I won't buy Russell again unless I can confirm the quality first..."
3,Spotted when arrived,"This appeared to be a returned product.. It had a spot in the right front that was noticible before removing the packaging. It didn't appear to be folded correctly, it had no cardboard holding the shirt neatly folded inside the bag. Appeared just ""jumbled"" into a bag. I don't have time to return it, so will wash the spot out."
5,"Durable, shiny, and very green","Nice durable, comfy shirt. I'd recommend it, though a similar shirt could be found at any clothes store and save you on shipping."
2,Another cultural vampire,"Nothing much new here: some Minnesota ""nice""and a lot of cliches. Hey brother, don't you knowthat coyotes don't share their secrets with white boys?"
1,Don't waste your money!,"Boring and tasteless.These ""remixes"" have neither the charm of the originalperformances nor the fresh viewpoint and polish tomake them unique and/or appealing musical experiences.Many of the selections are all but indistinguishablefrom each other.Can you say ""cheap exploitation""?Even the packaging is second class."
4,Fallout Tactics,"Fallout Tactics is similar to xcom and jagged alliance games.Pros:+Characters are very customizable+great death animations+fallout universe+good number of different/interesting enemies+good looking graphics+Cool maps/terrain/settings+Lots of characters+Various species (Ghouls, Super mutants)+Tons of different weapons, explosives, guns w/various ammo+cool weapon effects( lasers and such)Cons-gameplay can be a bit difficult to get the hang of at first-linear story-annoying comments made by enemies during combat-music is kind of annoyoing-very little NPC interaction or ""side quests""-when characters are equiped with different guns the characters look like they carry something different,every smg is an MP-5, every rifle an M-16( a shotgun looks like an M-16, for example)"
3,Bugs! Bugs! Bugs!,"Don't get me wrong this game is awesome, and fun, but the amount of bugs in this game makes it unbearable to play at times and extremely easy, and what really stinks is that after two patches it is still filled with bugs. All I can say is save often becuase the game will crash on you multiple times."
5,STUNNING,"This Game is absolutely awesome. I haven't encountered a game of this difficulty since the days of Nintendo. I love the fact that the designers made this for hardcore gamers, not the mainstream gamers who only like flash and flare. One of its more unique qualities is that it is a violent game that INVOLVES thinking. Not just an array of button-mashing. Hardcore Gamers and Mainstream gamers who want to think will greatly adore this masterpiece."
1,What were they thinking . . .,"I got this game after playing Fallout 3, it had a lot of hype and a fair fan base. However the game is filled with bugs, bad game mechanics, tedious game play, wonkey patches, stupid AI,and no replay value. It is nothing more then a ""fan-boy"" game, designed to be a gauntlet of combat with very little story.This is the game that killed Fallout. (before the FPS format of fallout 3)"
2,Sucks if you are expect Fallout. Fun if you like RTS.,Its a RTS. Not a RPG. And a not very fun one at that. All you do is run and gun. It's bad.
3,"Not as fun as the other two, but still fun...","Well, I also was quite worried what this new fallout would be like when I heard about it. It definitely is not a true fallout sequel, but it is a nice little diversion in the fallout universe. There are many different settings that will appeal to either the turn-based or real-time players. Perks and skill points are also used when upgrading your character so fans of the first two will feel right at home here. If you enjoyed the first two fallout games, you should at least give this a chance. You may find that you will enjoy it more than you thought you would."
2,Not worth the price,"This dryer is not worth the price. The switches are always in the way when I hold the dryer. (I'm always accidentally switching them hot to cold or on to off)I don't know why the mfg. doesn't put the hot/cold and hi/lo switches on the side of the dryer.I have a Conair 'Grand Champion II' that is over 20 yrs old and it's superior to the BaByliss. With either dryer, the texture of my hair is no different after drying."
5,great gift to give others...and to give to yourself!,I found this book first in a store and wound up reading it page by page without wanting to stop. It's filled with funny but ever so true wisdom that makes great inspiration and motivation. It's very cool how the pages pull out and then you can stick them up places to remind you of its affirmational messages. I wound up buying one for me...and one to give a friend as a gift...who also LOVED it! I now just ordered another to give as a gift. I absolutely recommend it...A favorite quickie stickie was the one that said THE GOOD NEWS: ONLY YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF YOUR DESTINY. the bad news:ONLY YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF YOUR DESTINY....and the graphic was two newspapers with these two different headlines. Which reminds me to mention...the art in this book was really well done...graphic and attention getting and fun.
5,For the serious prayer warrior!,"This book is a must have for the spiritual warrior. In these last days The Spirit of god is pouring out fresh insight, wisdom, vision, strategy and anointing- a mantal which Ana Mendez certainly has. Shaking the Heavens has sufficient Word, testimonies and teaching clarity. I had been hoping this experienced prayer warrior would write a book for the Body to be better equipped, and here it is!"
3,A mixed bag,"The Underworld Trilogy is at once great and average. The first movie, Underworld, has become a bit of a classic for the genre, featuring an interesting premise, a decent plot, and a story that unwinds with purpose and method. The sequel is a full-blown disaster, with convoluted plots, poor script, and a lacking sense of closure. Finally, the prequel, ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" corrects almost every mistake made in the second movie. A focus on character development, real (not CGI) effects, and a story simple in scope and easy to relate to serve up a fitting end.The Blu-ray video and audio quality is excellent. The dark and somber coloration used by the director is clearly evident in the picture and is far superior to the DVD, which I also have. There is an excellent surround mix and the dialog sounds perfectly placed.Overall, a technically marvelous set of movies - but as movies, you may find the premise a little lacking overall."
5,Loved it!!,I love the Underworld movies and was glad to be able to get the set.I watched them all at once!!
4,It was only a matter of time.,"I loved these movies and wanted to wait for the blu-ray trilogy before buying them. The picture quality is outstanding and the sound quality is equally outstanding. My only gripe with the trilogy is that it does not contain the extended versions which I would have liked a lot. If you want the theatrical release, this is outstanding. If you want the extended versions, you will need to wait a while."
4,Blu-ray - no DTS,"Its probably the way I have my system set-up and I am no means an audiophile and profess some ignorance to all the acronyms and what they mean- but to my ear. on the box set it would have been nice if it had the DTS surround sound audio option on these discs(ala the Blu-ray Bourne Trilogy and X-men Trilogy)but like I say its probably me, but it would have been nice to have it included."
5,There Are Vampires In These Films?,"Not gonna lie... there's a part of me that watches these for the ""Kate Beckinsale"" factor. But these are, seriously, some awesome movies. I owned the first two on DVD but I'm really not a video- or audio-phile, so I can't really tell you what percentage better the picture or sound quality is. All three movies looked beautiful, though, and if you already own the movies on DVD, I'd say it's worth the upgrade. I got these as part of Amazon's weekly blu-ray deal-of-the-week, but they'd have been a welcome part of my collection at full price.I'm still not sure which movie I like best. I was a bit put off by ""Rise of the Lycans"" becuase of it's notable lack of Kate Beckinsale, but I do like it a lot. Like most people, I watched them in their release order the first time. But after getting the blu-rays, I watched them in chronological order. MUCH BETTER. Also, it doesn't feel like you're losing Kate Beckinsale... you GAINING her. :P"
4,Movies,"I ordered these for a Werewolf themed Halloween party I was throwing. All 3 movies are in blu-ray format. Decent enough movies, they do a good job tying the 3 different story lines together. There is a little over acting on behalf of some of the vampires, but that seems standard for vampire movies."
2,"Love the movies, UltraViolet needs to go","Folks, if you are buying this hoping that you will be able to import it into iTunes, stop right now. Sony has teamed up or created a make shift company called UltraViolet. This is thier version of iTunes. Yes, that means ANOTHER media player, ANOTHER user name and pass to keep up with, and NO native iOS support. Sure you can get the Flixter app and then watch it, but why do that when most of us use iTunes daily for the same function.Now there are many claims on the net about UV giving out redemption codes for iTunes for thier titles, well that isnt the case anymore. Sony wants to compete with Apple, regardless of how many customers are lost. I for one, will pass on any blue ray with the UV (maybe even Sony too) logo on it and I would recommend you readers do the same."
2,GREAT MOVIES BUT......,was seriously thinking about this set but then saw that the digital copy is the ultraviolet client install...NO BUY !
4,Underworld Trilogy Blu-Ray,arrived quickly and all was in order and in good condition and would buy from them again
4,Underworld without Kate,I probably would have given this box set a 5 if it werent for the fact that Kate is not in the third movie. Take them for what they are. These movies are not a blockbuster-realistic movie. Use your imagination to go into their world. Enjoy Three great movies at a great price
1,no no no,"i was appauled when i received this purchase. just like everybody was saying 3 dvds stacked on top of each other one clip. i wasnt able to get the dvd's off the clip. looked into the return policy , it wasnt worth the hassel. i would have only received half back because i open the dvd. so i trashed it instead. i shall purchase this dvd else where. i love the movies itself but dont understand why someone would sale a triology like this."
3,Very Disappointed,The set is just the previous releases put into new packaging. I gave the low review due to Amazon stating that the set came with 2 tickets to the upcoming movie at the time I preordered; that's the entire reason I bought it. Every store I've been to has it cheaper (BB has it for 29.99 with the two tickets) and yet Amazon is more expensive and has no tickets with it. Extremely disappointed that I'm going to have to go elsewhere to re buy it again.
2,Disappointed,"A few friends recommended this to me, and I had heard mixed reviews, so decided to give it a go myself. While watching, however, I must admit that I was disappointed. I was expecting more because of the hype and okay reviews--even the previews looked promising--but it was a let-down. It all seemed dark and dreary. I like dark, and dreary is okay, but the story or the characters have to be interesting too, and I just didn't find it here. I wanted to. I stuck with them, but lost interest overall. I will say that the attempt was great, the ambition was there, and all of the resources, but something still lacked. I'll have to stick with Bram Stoker's Dracula for my vampire film, and Wolf for my werewolf film. I wish the Underworld trilogy had been closer to either of them."
1,producto no entregado,aun no he recibido estos discos en mi domicilio y tienen mas de 2 meses de atraso necesito respuestas Underworld Trilogy (Underworld / Underworld: Evolution / Underworld: Rise of the Lycans) [Blu-ray]
3,ok,"disks were pretty scratched up and one looked like it was repaired with some kind of glue, it played ok not sure how long it will last."
2,just not a fan,"I had seen parts of the Underworld movies on TV and I kept hearing wonderful things about them. But, I guess it just is not my thing. I really did not like the story all that much and it was not a great Vampire film for me. (Dont be pissed, I didn't like twilight either)but I can see how other would enjoy it."
1,"Good Movies, Bad Packaging!",I love the Underworld movies! and i remember seeing this three pack at other stores and it had a cardboard cases with all 3 movies and they had their own indvidual cases. So when baught this i figured i was going to have the same thing BOY WAS I WRONG!! Now it's not Amazon.com's fault... not their fault at all. It is the manufacturer's fault because they are so cheap. The discs are just stacked up one each other and makes them get scratched up. I would rather pay the indvidual price then have scratched up movies!!!!!!!!
3,very good,"This was a very good purchase for the price,especially if you're an Underworld fan. I was not a fan,but am one now."
3,Bad DVD Case Packaging,"The 3 DVDs are stacked one on top of another and held by a single clip. I doubt it would have cost more than a cent or two to insert a plastic DVD separator page. The current packaging causes the DVDs to be easily scratched upon eachother during removal and replacement to the clip. The movies are great, but the packaging is cheaply done."
4,Great Movie Series for me,"I lot of people don't like ""Underworld"" but I love the characters in the series so if you like Vampire movies that don't make everyone out to be a good guy, this is a good series to consider. I grew up on Dark Shadows, this is my substitute or rather the next generation for it."
3,Not complete spanish support,"I buyed this trilogy because it says that it has spanish subtitles for the 3 movies. But, it has the subtitles just for the evolution and rise of the lycans movies. The first don't has it."
4,Great!,"i love these movies. great story lines. the CGI effects are great for the most part, but sometimes it looks like they could have used a little more work. i definitely would recommend you check them out."
3,underworld,For customer outside US just make sure the dvd you order is suitable for your player by looking the DVDs region
3,"Awesome movie, false advertising","Movies are awesome, blu-ray provides excellent quality. Amazon false advertises the ""digital copy"" however, as the ""copy"" they include is from 2 years ago and you cannot claim it."
2,DVD case provides terrible cheap packaging,"The 3 DVDs are placed on top of each other. I do not know why the items are not placed on separate plastic holders, but I am certain the DVDs are liable to become easily scratched. Plus it is irritating to have to remove all 3 to watch one movie. I would recommend getting these DVDs in different packaging."
4,Underworld trilogy,"nice bargain and addition to my collection. The shipping was fast and the price was right. The movies 1 and 2 are a great story, but #3 goes a bit off ."
1,Bad description,It was not what I ordered... The third disc does not have spanish subtitles as it says... I have to return them twice!
3,I didn't notice the high definition,"I rate the trilogy with 3 stars only because I'm a little disappointed with the video quality. I really didn't notice the high definition of a typical bluray movie. One more thing, first film comes with italian subtitles, why?? I think there's more people who speak spanish than italian here in america or am I wrong? Otherwise I still love the movies."
3,Perfectly fine until I hit the third movie...,"I was never a huge Underworld fan and never even bought the DVD, but when the trilogy set came out and went on sale I decided to get it for cheap.I found the first two movies of the series to be at least entertaining and look nice, but Rise of the Lycans looked atrocious on my TV. Over half the scenes were extremely grainy--so much so that I can't even blame the cinematography. It definitely impacted my viewing experience.I have contacted Sony to determine if this is a rare manufacturing issue, or if it looks that way on every disc, but in the meantime, beware."
5,Underworld Trilogy,I was glad to get my DVD's of the Trilogy and have seen them and have found the 3 DVD's to be in excellant shape...was glad to do business with Amazon.com....
1,"no no no to ultraviolet digital copy, no no no",if it doesnt have regular digital copy i will not buy it. im used to putting my digital copies in my iTunes and i have no use for something extra just because they wanna be childish about it trying to keep Apple out of the loop.no no no.
1,I still havn't recieved this item.,"I am very upset, because I trusted this site, to purchase from. Unfortantly that has been proven otherwise, because I have yet to recieve this item. So I will never order from Amazon ever again. I have yet to recieve any assistance."
1,Do not purchase this chair,I bought this chair and it broke after 3 months of use. Horribly made product.
5,GREAT SLAVE NOVEL,Garnder F. Fox originally published this novel under the pen name of Clement Purvis.
3,so-so,"I wanted a locking pocket knife with a sharp point and this was 1 of 3 I was looking at. Got this one because it's stainless. It requires frequent sharpening, but I like to know that it's sturdy. The point punches very nicely. It has a pocket clip, and I never know it's there whether clipped or sitting in my pocket. The handle is very comfortable.Here are my gripes: The thumb stud is only on one side. The useful blade (top of choil to tip) is 2.0"", not 2.33"". It should not be priced more than $10. The clip is kind of big.It comes with a wrench for the body and clip, which is nice, but the pivot bolt is different. It's not the best, but it works fine for me."
4,superior work interest level high,this work is verygood and interest level very high especially the language factor well worth the read hig school APclasses could use it
4,Correction!!!,"According to Naxos.com, track 10 on this CD is the (extremely short) second movement of Brandenburg's 3rd Concerto, which does in fact only last 11 seconds. Therefore nothing is missing on this CD. I was one of the twenty cellos on it, so I should know!! I give it four stars because I am not a huge fan of the Brubeck pieces, but I think the cello playing is great of course!"
3,50/50 Chance It Will Work,"I recently purchased two of these sprinkler heads. They do APPEAR to be well-constructed and made of good-quality materials. Unfortunately, one of them does not work. The sprinkler moves in one direction, but it will not return in the other direction. There is sufficient water pressure because the other sprinkler head from the same shipment works well.However, I have decided not to return this product. I have already returned two other items out of the same shipment because they were damaged or defective, and I'm tired of dealing with returns. I also feel like I should be able to fix this thing on my own. It's not a complicated piece of machinery. I hope that my male ego isn't just getting in the way.I've rated it as 3 stars because I can't rate it 2.5 stars to indicate it has a 50/50 chance of working."
5,The best of the best.,"I have three (3) of the Orbit tripod (three legged) sprinklers that operate 4-6 hrs. a day, 4-5 days a week. Recently one of my sprinkler head springs broke, can you imagine that. So I ordered a replacement head and a spare. They are so versatile in how and where you can place the water. Thank GOD I live in the country and have my own water well. freddie mack"
2,disappointed..... very expensive to have so many problems,I paid $25 for the sprinkler head and the base. Very disappointing as the nut that secures is constanly getting loose causing the adusting spring to spin. I have found it watering my windows more than once. The base is rusty on the inside (only bought last month) and sprays rusty water when turned on for the first couple of seconds and it doesn't drain after hose is turned off. $25 is way to much to spend for something that has so many problems. Wish I had tried the Melnor 3900H Heavy Duty Metal Pulsating Sprinkler which has lots more postive reviews.
5,Good product/,"I got tired of using plastic ones. They kept breaking, so I decided to switch to brass. Jury still out. It does need good water pressure to perform as required. I have a well and the water pressure is not as high as city provided water pressure, so this item is not performing as well as I would like it to, not the mfg. problem though. So, if your water pressure is around 35 psi or less, this sprinkler head may not work well for you."
3,Play-time gone bad,Interesting play about two brothers in South Africa. These brothers are the only characters in the play other than the mentioned absent ones. Disturbing ideas of family values and loyalty. Particularly eerie ending.
1,Don't Bother On This One...,"I downloaded this to my Kindle, and like the other reviewer you get the cover and one page--no content whatsoever."
2,Echhh...,"Had mine for a couple of years. Used it for walking the pups at night. But now it is broken. Not sure why, I think it's got something to do with the now black bulb. First, that bulb should be fine for the number of hours that I have used it. Second, the end button is kind of hard to activate. It will push, but not with just one finger. You need to secure the light with one hand and press the end cap button with the other. If the idea of a head lamp is ""hands-free"" there must be a better way to turn it on and off than using both hands... Especially when one hand has a leash in it and the other a plastic bag full of, well, dog..."
1,Go Video DDV2001,Worst VCR I ever bought. Customer service is impossible to get in touch with ( if a customer service actually exists )Sound quality and picture quality are extremely poor.Go Video is a total waste of money and set up time in my opinion.
1,vcr dies fast,"I bought this vcr""GO VIDEO"" product and it's only a year old and both decks have decided to not play a picture.It has been cleaned and it was rarely used.I contacted customer service through email and I was told it had to be sent in to be repaired.WARRANTLY IS UP!Now most vcrs I have ever had last for years with no trouble.I definetly love the dual deck but not from GO VIDEO!!"
2,WEAK PLOTS. WEAKER SCORES. WHEN'S THE NEXT SHIP OUT?,"In the Golden Age of Hollywood, each studio usually took a stab all various genres, but excelled in only one. Warner Brothers cornered gangster films, with forays into musicals (Busby Berkeley) and noir (Bogart). Universal dabbled in lots of B-films, but succeeded big-time with horror. MGM, of course, produced the best musicals. Fox did melodramas --- especially noir --- with an occasional romp on MGM's musical turf. And usually those romps hit some really bad notes. Witness the first three flicks in their Marquee Musicals series. Daddy Long Legs has Astaire and Caron, Pin-Up Girl has Betty Grable, Week-End in Havana has Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda, The memory of these films, for the most part, is a lot better than the films themselves. The pleasant but fairly pedestrian scores, thin plots and busy character actors scurrying around propping up the story make for rough going. And make one yearn for Mickey and Judy."
4,"Great fun, for what it's worth","This is a great showcase film for Cesar Romero and Carmen Miranda. Both have great comedic roles and they do a great job. Alice Faye and John Payne play their usual stock characters in a story full of cliches, but that's okay because they are both lovable eye candy. Alice is wonderful, singing Tropical Magic in her velvety 1940s alto voice. Carmen is still close enough to her Brazilian origins at this point in 1941 to add authenticity to her performance, especially in numbers like the Parrot song. For me the standout was Cesar Romero with his pitch perfect characterization and comedic timing. Of course, this was all done during a time when studios could still get away with ridiculously unrealistic plots, cardboard sets and offensive ethnic stereotypes, but as long as you can cut them a little slack in this regard, you will enjoy this film."
2,Not that good.,"The basic plot of this movie is a good one, except that they draw it out longer than necessary. Alice Faye is a shopgirl who has saved up her money for a cruise and is devastated when an accident happens and it can't be completed. John Payne portrays the shipping magnate's future son-in-law who is sent to convince Alice Faye to sign a waiver of liability. She refuses as she knows that the Captain was not fulfilling his duties that night. So she ends up with a free trip to Havana. Carmen Miranda has quite a few cameos, the reason for her fame being lost on today's audiences. And Caesar Romero plays the ne'er do well Latin lover who woos Alice Faye for her supposed wealth. It could have been a good film, but it just was too drawn out and then the important parts done too quickly to be a good movie."
4,Weekend in Havana,"For those of us who enjoy Alice Faye musicals, it was a pleasant and enjoyable movie."
2,barely enjoyable,"This is another silly sub-par musical from Twentieth Century Fox, restored in gorgeous color to DVD. The plot is on a high school level, the acting is little better, the comedy is virtually non-existent, and the music is entirely forgettable. Still, two stars for Carmen Miranda and Alice Faye's rhumba. John Payne belonged at Monogram."
5,Hard as hell to find and Amazon really took the pain out of it,"This cd was for a woman who means the world to me. She wanted it and I knew I had to get it for her. I spent days looking elsewhere and had almost given up hope. When I came to Amazon, there it was. GJ Amazon! Thank you for this one!While the music isn't all up to my taste... the song, Come Dance With Me, is a wonderful groovy song!"
4,Typical for the Genre,"First, these were a gift for my wife, and she liked them very much. On that alone, I should perhaps have given them 5 stars. But having watched most of them with her, it is hard to rate anything less than a classic that high. They are what they are, Film Noir. Pretty simple stories; short and to the point. The acting and plots are typical to the genre. The condition of the transfers was fine. Era excepted, nothing particularly racy about these. A lot of pleasant viewing for an old movie fan. I will add that ""The Killer That Stalked New York"" has a slight twist; not quite the plot subject you would expect, but it follows the noir form just fine."
2,Barely Worth Watching,"I always like to see the automobiles in old films, but they were about the only attraction ini these four films. ""Two of a Kind"" was the best of the four movies, and would have rated another star if reviewed by itself. Most of its attraction was Lisabeth Scott, who also appears in ""Bad for Each Other,"" but couldn't salvage the latter from its unconvincing plot and bad acting from the rest of the cast. ""The Killer that Stalked New York"" seemed like a movie that might be shown in Middle School health class -- definitely not a film noir. The fourth film, ""The Glass Wall,"" had an improbable but nonetheless predictable plot not worthy of the actors. I thought calling these films ""Bad Girls of Film Noir"" was misleading. I think the three actresses did appear in film noirs, but those were other movies, not these. I won't be purchasing the other set of movies in this release."
3,film noir?,"In my opinion most of these films were not true film noir and thus somewhat disappointing. The girls were not all that bad (the type to stick a knife in your back and make you love it not so). Most had a soft side but the stories were worth seeing. Heston vastly over rated. His grimace wears thin after you`ve seen several of his movies. Love Lizabeth Scott. If not for her, the series wouldn`t have been worthwhile."
4,"Review of Bad Girls of Film Noir, Vol. 1","Three of the four films are surprisingly very good. Only two of the films, however, I would classify as film noir, as they have happy endings. We enjoyed ""The Killer That Stalked New York"" less than the others. Overall, this is a very good value for the money."
2,Film Noir ?,"None of the movies in this package are worthy of serious consideration either as film noir or outstanding ""B"" movies. Vol II is no better."
2,Didn't close,"This locket looked very nice for the price. That is why it got 2 stars, but it didn't close and didn't appear to have any mechanism for closing. It was useless and unwearable so I returned it."
4,Good - wife loved it,Locket was a little hard to open at first: but my nails suck. Wife has no problem with it. She loves having a locket with a picture of her baby and cat in it. prodcut came quickly too.
3,Trite video visions set to a great soundtrack,"I have the audio CD of the first Enigma album, and it's one of my favorites; I've played it at least 25 times. This video version, however, is a disappointment. Overall, I have to agree with the reviewer (below) who gave it one star... although I think his judgment is a bit harsh.Basically, there's about 10-15 minutes worth of visuals, which are recycled over and over. Much of the imagery is self-consciously symbolic, and the supposedly erotic portions get tiring after a while; how many shots of women caressing swords can you take?So, five stars for the music, two stars for the visuals, 3.5 stars overall."
2,didn't work for me,"My first time trying a homeopathic pain relief, and it didn't do anything for me. I've avoided medications for years, so I'm hoping to find something natural that works. There's a lot out there, and supposedly you just have to find one that works with your body. I have no doubt this one may very well work for others chemistry--just not me."
5,Smallville Curse,"Excellent read! Could easily be used as an episode. Everyone is in character, fast paced with lots of action. Most enjoyable!"
4,GREAT MOVIE!,When I saw Madhouse I thought is was great!I mean that Elizibeth Peters girl was HOT!I got the hole body count:Ellen-Decapitated with knifeElizibeth Peters-Pitchfork in the neckParty Girl-Strangled and hungDirector-Crushed by top of bedElizibeths Aunt and Uncle-Both impaled with a swordJulia-Knife in the neckKiller-Stabbed to death
3,Helmet a little off,"Was as advertised and I didn't even try to have them replace it. But, mine had the helmet squished a bit, where it was unattractive."
4,I liked the Gold Bond Medicated Lotion very ...,I liked the Gold Bond Medicated Lotion very much. I have very dry skin and it was very soothing. It even seemed to help a rash I'd developed on my legs. It has a clean smell and doesn't stain your clothing. It also relieves itchy skin. I liked the plastic squeeze bottle -- very easy to use. I plan on buying more of this lotion when this bottle is empty. Great stuff! You won't be disappointed with this product.
4,Gold Bold Medicated Body Lotion is a great ...,"Gold Bold Medicated Body Lotion is a great body lotion. It's the only lotion that I've found that takes care of itchy, dry skin without being heavy or greasy. It healed the dry skin on my hands and arms. The only problems that I had with the lotion were the slight stinging sensation from the medication in the lotion, and the medicinal smell. Overall, the product was effective in taking care of the problem for which it was used."
4,Very Good Album!,"Don't hesitate to buy this album! A truly great band whose talent was overlooked and underappreciated as a result of bad breaks, mostly caused by the record companies that they were signed to!"
5,Great music that stands the test of time,"I have had the original Epitaph LP'S for about 20 years. This german band mirrors the early works of Wishbone Ash with it's supberb melodies,harmonies and guitar interplay. Makes for great headphone listening. Definitely one of the great import bands of all time. The first time I heard their music was over a stereo system in a record store back in 1974. It was such powerful music I had to ask the clerk whom they were playing. I bought the record and an Epitaph fan was born. This selection ranges from the rockin' ""Moving to the country"" to the harmonic guitar jam of ""Little Maggie"". I was suprised to see this CD even listed. Buy it and enjoy."
1,This product was rather disappointing. The nail brush ...,"This product was rather disappointing. The nail brush didn't seem like it was designed to handle pedicures (okay for fingernails, not toenails). The pumice stone didn't provide any value. This is one item that will be left out of my already crammed bathtub."
2,I didn't like this nailbrush much. The pumice ...,"I didn't like this nailbrush much. The pumice stone isn't very good quality and it's much too hard for my feet. I got scratches on my feet from using the stone. Also, the nailbrush is very near to the stone, so you can't clean your nails with this brush. I won't recommend this product to anyone."
3,Amusing soufflé dished out in 'Truffled Feathers',"The premise is fine. ...Part of the story is told from Carolyn's point of view and part from Jason's. Both character's put their own spin on what has transpired, with very different results.Nancy Fairbanks likes her characters and makes this a fun read. The finish may leave you shaking your head in wonder, as it did me, but I would like to check out Carolyn's other adventure (in New Orleans) and see what's cooking at the Blue's.As for 'Truffled Feathers', it was a nifty way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon. I give it three stars: Five stars for interesting, likable characters and two stars for the slightly muddled ending."
4,Three times the scares,"This film is a trilogy of tales related by deathrow inmate Debbie Rochon to her executioner Gunnar Hansen (the original LeatherFace. All three stories are excellent, but I especially liked the last one involving a bizarre biker ritual to revive their dead protector played silently by J.J. North. Someone who looks as good as J.J. does not have to speak! The real star is Debbie Rochon. Her character drips violence and the ending will make you say wow. This film was originally shot in 1997. Troma was smart to pick it up. This pic went over big at the annual Chiller Theatre convention in NJ. Joe Bob Briggs loved it, and it will pave the way for Debbie Rochon to climb to the top of the scream queen list."
3,Dr. Lecter's younger sister needs a few lessons.,"A proud serial killer (Debbie Rochon) tells her executioner three gory tales. A mother having nightmares about her missing kids. A southern belle plotting to bump off her hubby with occult help. And a biker gang raising cane, unexpectedly. I'd rather watch Silence Of The Lambs a few hunderd more times!"
3,SO SO,"There were some parts I liked, the info was ok but the quality of the DVD itself was not that great I like Mike Dooley and have read his books but I just am not so sure about this program. Overall it wasnt great but it wasnt bad either."
3,A little disappointed...,"I have followed Mike Dooley for years and have most of his materials. He is warm, funny, down to earth and a great teacher. However, in this video he was being spontaneously translated into Spanish and his speech seemed slow and ponderous.The lighting was not very good, with Mike standing in front of a dark curtain and looking like someone holding a flashlight under their chin. He's terrific, but I was disappointed in the quality of the visual presentation. Next time, I'll find out if he's been filmed in another country before I purchase the video. I purchased this one from Amazon and I don't believe you can return videos after they have been viewed."
2,Mostly padding,Mike Dooley seems like a very nice gentleman so I hate to give a negative review - but the entire 72 minute video could have been condensed into five minutes. Focus on the end result- let the universe handle the details.
1,"Mike Dooley is on a roll , save your money !!",Mike Dooley is on roll to attract wealth using your wealth. I did not find any of his book or advise useful or even practical. `
3,"More, yes. Better, no.","More Signs of Life definitely has the same feel as it's predecessor, Signs of Life. It is a somewhat laid-back, trippy, dubby-in-parts compilation. There are quite a few strange and interesting samples throughout.It just doesn't measure up to the first one, however. This disc is a pleasant listening experience, easily worth the buy but if you were amazed by the tracks on Signs of Life, do not expect to necessarily be amazed by this disc, simply because it is the second in the series."
4,Catchy Swedish rock,"This has been one of my favorite CDs over the last year. The songs are pop-like and catchy, with lead singer Niklas Hillbom's vocals boyish, nasalized and often pleasantly jaded. If you like Third Eye Blind's first album, then you will like Jumper. All the lyrics are Swedish, but don't be scared off. I even have had non-Swedish speakers beginning to hum along. My favorite track is #5 ""Tofflor och skor"" (Slippers and Shoes)."
5,Buried my head in the sand..thanks for rescuing me!,"All too often, I've lamented about the current trend of morally decadent offerings. So much so, at regular intervals, I buried my head in the sand and refused to view another disappointing book, television show or movie.Thank goodness I tilted my head long enough to read The Bristle Path. Refreshing as an unexpected shower on a warm Summer night. Satisfying as pie a la mode after a wonderful meal and warm as a hug from someone you love.If more authors concentrated on moral values instead of raking their readers over hot coals of wanton sex, violence and crime, I would take chances more often. Nita and her family experienced a multitude of problems, but they also tried to hold onto a sense of pride and dignity leading to hope for a better tomorrow. I'm sure I'm not the only ostrich out there. It would behoove others like myself to read this book that re-affirms a sense of well being sorely needed in these trying times. Kudos, Mikki!!"
4,The Bristle Path,"I enjoyed the Bristle Path it kept my intrest from the begin to the end . Nita, the main character the book was about shows hopes and dreams being shattered and later when you go through turning into good when you least expect. This book made me cry ,laugh be angry, and have hope and joy knowing things can get better. I did not put it down until I was finished."
2,Nonstick Pancakes,"I was disappointed in this pan because it didn't make cooking pancakes easier. It does have a great nonstick coating, but my food still stuck. The pan gets super hot, and so does the handle which makes it hard to cook. The pan is very heavy and hard to move."
5,Does what it is made to do!,"If you have purchased this item and you can't get it to work, then you are not using it properly. This item works great! You have to hammer this onto the socket that you are trying to remove. A heavy hammer does the trick. Use an extension with the socket so you can get it on properly."
2,"poor battery, no support","The unit looses all battery power after sitting TURNED OFF for 3 or so days. Griffin first told me it should hold a charge like my cell phone; well that lasts weeks if its turned off. Then they said the following - not comforting! ""From our testing, this is just how the Journi acts. We wish that it would last longer than that, but this is what is to be expected from the Journi. Unfortunately the product has been discontinued and the issue will not be addressed."""
2,Portable Speaker,"I was quite disappointed in this. The hissing irritates me. Unless you have it really loud you hear constant hissing. I ordered another speaker/docking station because this will not do. Buy the Cyber Acoustics Portable Digital Docking Speaker. It's cheaper, smaller and there's no hissing."
4,nice little speaker system for iPod,"This Griffin Journi speaker system is worth every penny. It's a nice little system, worthy of fillin any small room with good quality sounding music. It's not an ultra powerful system (i cannot really hear it above the sounds in my hot tub while using it outdoors), yet I wasn't trying to pump up the volume and disturb the neighbors anyway. It's probably the most handy and portable speaker system for iPods, and even has a nice remote control which stores into the case. The case flips open and becomes the ""stand"" for the speakers, but it doesn't lock down tightly. It seems to do the trick though. I find it's a great way to keep the iPod charged."
4,"Great sound for a portable, love it in my office","Received this griffin portable speaker for a Christmas gift. The sound is great. Love that it holds a charge for days. It also charges the ipod at the same time so if you took it on vacation you would only need one charger. My only complaint is the stand is a little flimsy, but once it is upright it does stay standing."
5,good,"I'm glad to have found this on Amazon, a friend has it & it is great, a good gift for my daughter"
5,Great Toy,"My husband does a lot of woodworking and other construction projects. My 3 year old loves to watch and always wants to steal daddy's tools. Little tools are cute, the wood pieces are great for little guy imaginations and seems to hold up to all the punishment that a toddler can dish out. Great buy at a much cheaper price than many of the other brands names of construction sets."
1,Big Letdown,Don't waste your money on this toy. I knew it was basically a plastic storage rack for foam pieces but was still excited about the drill and bolts. The drill is too weak to even work. My son (3 yrs old) has barely touched it since Christmas. It's just collecting dust in a corner.
2,"It's ok, help required","We had this bench from the time my son was 2 until he was 4. The tools, nuts, and bolts were fun, but the foam wood pieces were hard to stick together and not as much fun as the melissa and doug tool box pieces. Wanted it to be a winner, but it wasn't."
3,Great but drill stopped working the first day,Wish the drill would have been better. Once that stopped working my daughter stopped playing with it. Other than that the fake wood pieces were cool but a definitely a little difficult for a 3 year old to put together.
4,Family play time,"My 3.5 year old son loves building things and using tools and being my little handy man. This toy is not perfect, the draw is a bit hard to open, and you can't make all the things at once, you have to take some apart to make others. But that's the point; you can take things apart and remake them over and over again. I do wish the little paper that has the instructions was made to last or in a small plastic book format, but over all its great. This is not a video or a computer game that you can sit your child down in front of and expect them to be entertained for hours, this is a toy that you sit down and play with them. I love this interactive learning toy and all the fun my whole family has playing with it"
4,Grown-ups Love It!,"My 3.5 yr old graddaughter asked for a workbench for Christmas 2012 so after reading many reviews, I bought her this one. She was thrilled with the drill and hammer and, I think, with some help she'll enjoy making things with the soft building pieces. Actually, the grown-ups spent a fair amount of time testing their construction skills. The unit is sturdy and everything fits her little hands. It's also just the right height for her and doesn't take up a lot of space in her play area. The only downside is that the drawer is difficult to open and close even for an adult.She needs some direction and explanation about all the bells & whistles and I'm hoping her dad or mom will find the time to help her. If not, her little brother will inherit it! I feel some help is required to understand the features to make it a learning experience, especially for younger children. But, overall, I recommend this toy."
3,Not As Good As I Had Hoped,"Bought this for my 5 year old grandson for Christmas. What upsets me is that the ""electric"" screw driver doesn't have much power. If you are trying to build something using the ""wood"" pieces, you will need to use the regular screw driver. The vice also doesn't tighten very well plus the drawer that holds the tools is very hard to pull out. I had read that on other reviews, but I thought I could run a bar of soap over it to make it glide better. Didn't work because everything is plastic. I am also wondering what the saw is for. Evidently just pretend. Overall, I am disappointed."
5,LOVE!,"This toy is great! Definitely a Step2 product! We made all the different items with the ""wood"" blocks. My 3 year old son loved seeing it on Christmas. My 5 year old daughter loves working at the tool bench as well. Great product and very durable!"
4,workbench,"Great for my g-son who loves to build things, but there are a lot of pieces. Some of which should probably be put up until he is older."
5,One of this year's favorite Christmas presents,"We bought this for our 3 1/2 year-old grandson for Christmas. He loves it--especially the ability to make things from the foam ""wood"" pieces. Within a couple of weeks, he had already completed several ""projects."" It now holds all of his ""tool"" collection, and I believe it will prove to be one of those toys that ""grow"" with the child for several years to come."
5,Completely cute and fun.,"I am the Auntie - so not able to report the long term durability & value. I did help assemble & play with it for several hours on the day it arrived. So very cute and fun. It was a huge hit. Assembled easily and seemed sturdy and durable. The toy tools worked - the driver/drill was able to screw the bolts into the work bench and back them out. Kiddos and Grandpa were assembling the projects - mostly bird houses - from the foam ""wood"" like 3-D puzzles right away.The battery in the drill didn't last very long, but I'm not sure if it was a brand new battery. It may have come out of another toy. Lesson for me - include batteries with a gift that requires them!"
3,kids work bench,I was disappointed. This bench was much smaller than I expected. Not sure it is was worth the money yet.
3,Just Right,"My 2+ year old grandson had a great time with this item. He and his sister spent hours putting the projects together. Replacing the pieces of ""wood"" in their forms gave them an extra treat-they saw it as a puzzle.On the other hand, construction of the unit was a slight problem. The instruction concerning attaching the ""vise"" were not clear. We received the four screws to attach the top to the base, but there were no holes in the base to screw them into although there were holes provided on the top.All in all my grandson was delighted and that's what counts."
4,wonderful and creative tool bench,This was my son first tool bench at about 3 1/2. I saw it and immediately loved it! I loved being able to make real projects with him! He amazingly was able to do many by himself. He played with it for hours and it was a nice toy. His dad did upgrade this one with the Little tykes one with the car but I have nbothing but good things to say about this tool bench!
2,Beware: this is shipped in original box with the label slapped on it...,"I can't say how this product is yet, but I need to warn everyone that if this is for a gift, it comes shipped in the original box, so your gift recipient will know what it is when it arrives. Good thing we intercepted it before my son could see it! At this time of year, there should be an outer box for shipping so the inside is hidden!"
2,"Workshop not so ""real""","I got this for my son's 4th birthday present and I was disappointed to find out it is foam and not wood. I thought the projects were ""real"" projects. If we make a bird house out of foam it will be destroyed in the rain or by the birds themselves. Very disappointing."
2,Dud Battery,When i received the battery I placed it in the charger. It indicated full charge. Removed from Charger and placed in camera. Camera would not power up. I charged battery per instructions included and it would not revive. I contacted Seller and they gave full refund no questions asked. I gave a 2 star rating because the battery was not good and caused me to have to contact the seller in order to get a refund. If I could give a Customer Service Rating it would be a 5.
4,I would recommend Gold Bond Medicated Body Powder ...,"I would recommend Gold Bond Medicated Body Powder to someone who suffers from pain or itching. Unfortunately (or fortunately), I wasn't suffering from this during my trial usage of this product. I did however, have my son try it on his feet ... which tend to be ... now how can I put this nicely ... STINKY!!!! It worked. The powder absorbed the excess moisture and odor from his lovely little teenage jock feet! The powder is on the gritty side and has a medicinal smell to it. Much better than stinky feet, though!"
1,Pretty bad,"I hate to diss these low-budget efforts, which are usually a labor of love for the filmmakers. Some things in this movie were ok and it could have been entertaining, but... it fails the laugh-out-loud test.The vampires look like they got their choppers at a Wal-Mart on Halloween. (The graphic on Amazon is quite misleading.) The victims just kind of stand there in a stupor while the vampires gnaw on them and rip off body parts. Any witnesses to this mayhem behave exactly like the victims; they just stand and stare. God forbid anyone should run away!There is some nudity, but not particulary vampiric. Once they attack, there's no seduction, it's strictly dinner time.Even if you are on a quest to see every vampire movie ever made, try to put this one off as long as possible."
4,Surreal Cityscape,"I was lucky enough to catch this feature at a local film festival (twice!), and i have to say it's an impressive piece of cinema.""Tokyo!"" has three foreign directors (Michel Gondry,Leos Carax, Bong Joon Ho) exploring three different stories that play out within the urban landscape of Tokyo. A foreign language film, each of these vignettes manages to explore vastly different themes concerning life, love, and the human condition.Honestly the best thing about the film for me was how you can interpret these different stories in so many ways, each viewing triggering a different perspective you might not have originally thought of. There's also plenty of variety to be had, with the magical fancy of ""Interior Design"", godzilla-esque destruction in ""Merde"" and the quirky humor of ""Shaking Tokyo"".A difficult movie to pigeonhole, and to some extent describe, i am nonetheless very excited to hear that ""Tokyo!"" is coming to DVD and Bluray. Cannot wait to add this to my collection."
2,Not intresting,"Sorry this is boring, looks like short movies done by students with a budget. I was hoping to get some eye candy of Tokyo out of it but it's not the case."
5,Michele,"This set is just adorable. Not only is it cute, it is very useful and well made. Great gift item!"
5,"Great Album, Really Catchy","Husband and wife duo fusing rock, rap and folk very smoothly. Eminemesque vocals and themes with great storytelling vocals. Very catchy songs with choruses to sing along too. For Fans of G Love and The Whitestripes."
1,It's just a rip-off!,"What a waste of money! The seller of this phone does not support his product in any way, not even from a customer service point of view. The driver does not work with Windows Vista. To make matters worse, the seller substituted a the Titanium Grey grey phone for the slightly more expensive red phone ordered, without a word of explanation. Further attempts at communication over the purchase were completely ignored. I don't think Amazon.com has done its homework on that one. It's a rip-off.My advice: Don't buy it!Top Rated Skype Certified USB Ip Skype Phone Voip Ip-700m in Titanium Grey"
4,essential scorpions,"uli john roths last recording with the scorps ! you must also own in trance and virgin killer their 70s albums are all classic hard rock,spacey,moody pieces of art as the 80s came in and guitarist uli jon roth left they became more commercial sounding ,though i also recommend animal magnetism !"
5,My Fav Scorpion Album!,"I am a huge fan of Uli-era scorpions and this album has all my favorites. The best track is sails of charon, and we'll burn the sky. Must listen!"
3,Good but not great,"I see some people here saying that Roth ""has nothing on Blackmore"" etc etc or that he's better than Malmsteen and Van Halen..you've got to be kidding me! Uli Roth is good, but to compare him to Malmsteen and EVH is just plain ignorant and stupid."
3,A all round good album but...,"...BLACKOUT rapes this blindfolded. I know uli is god and i love him but,jabbs is just a more *pure* metal guitarist then roth is. Anyway, i thought it was good but it had a lot of filler in it to go with the good songs. the best songs were STEAMROCK FEVER, WELL'BURN THE SKY, SAILS OF CHARON, HE'S A WOMAN SHE'S A MAN and the rest were just o.k. i guess. not a bad choice if you are getting into this band but it does get a little repetative after awhile."
5,Excellent treatment of basic stagecraft techniques,"Planning, shop management, tools, set pieces, painting, strike--they're all here. Welker set out to write not an encyclopedia of stagecraft but a guidebook of best techniques. He succeeded admirably. Useful for high school, college, and community theatres"
2,Disapointed,"Instructions were ""ok"" but 2 of the pens did not work and the black marker was dried up."
2,Amerzone Review,"This game had beautiful graphics and scenery,but the story was so lame and the ending a total let down.The puzzles were too easy and the game interface prehistoric.Dreamcatcher games are all very similar in their disappointing story lines and poor game interaction,so I recommend buying them only when they are really cheap.I have played many many adventure games and this one is definitely not for the player who likes myst,gabriel knight,monkey island etc..It is way too simple and short.This would be a good game for grandma and junior only."
3,Fun but not memorable,"The graphics were ok, the story was ok, and if you like journey games with lots of weird animals this is definitly up your alley. But the game itself was rather short and abrupt, taking you to the next phase in the game before you quite understood what you had done in the first. The gameplay was shamelessly easy. (I'm one of those who had to cheat my way through Myst) Well, you won't need to cheat your way through this one! Combine all this up and you have a game that I at least didn't mind wasting five hours on. (It was so easy it only took 5 hours to play.)..."
3,great music and graphics,"This game has really good graphics and great music.The animal noises such as the bees,the frogs and jungle birds are awesome.I rate it about average compared to other games.It is not as hard as necronomicon and several others.It is still fairly challenging however."
3,"Fun, but short and morbid","Amerzone was a very fun game- don't get me wrong. It has beautiful graphics and puzzles that aren't easy enough to offend you and not so hard you scream. Really, though, it was short, only a couple hours at best, and their are too many irrelevent bits of information and places that you could spend hours wandering even though there isn't anything important there. The voice acting isn't too great- I could only identify two different voice types for the whole thing- foreign and old. People also have a very annoying tendency to die right after you finish talking to them- 3 out of 4 people that you talk to do. The conversations are totally one sided- you yourself never get to talk. It's worth what you pay for it, but nothing special."
2,As linear as a yard stick,"This game's packaging made it look promising, but while the graphics are beautiful, the linearity of the ""puzzle"" solving astounded me (I have NEVER played a game before that required such an absolutely linear progression) and the puzzles were far, far too simple for experienced gamers. I had my pad of paper and pencil all ready, and only ONCE did I actually record any information there.My husband and I (we always play games as a team) were also amused by the fact that while you retrace this man's steps from his journey in the 1930s, at each step of the way, you pick up a computer disk to help you to the next stage. Marvelous 1930s technology, those computer disks.Even for one of the mass-produced games coming out of Dreamcatcher, this one was disappointing."
3,"Kinda short, rather predictable","Nice graphics, puzzles in the easily workable and nicely challenging area, kind of short and a little predictable."
3,Disapointed,"Yes, it's spooky, but the game is so old that the actual game size on my screen is about 3 x 4 inches. Yuck. Don't bother with this one."
3,Mixed review:,"I'm on a new game kick right now, so you might notice my page has many game reviews crunched together. I am trying to find that ""just right"" game. If you have a 12 yr. old, or are an adventure game ""beginner"" ...this game is sure to delight. It's literally a junior version of ""Myst"". It is riddled with beautiful graphics, rich color, and has a great mystical story line. Unfortunately, for all of us average gamers (who did solved the fantiscally frustrating Myst a while ago) this is not for us. The game's puzzles are too simple, many times, unrelated to the plot, and frankly, I just can't see it holding an advanced gamer's attention for more than an hour. It's just too easy. I give it 3 stars for a junior player, but 1 for young/average adults. Don't waste your money. Since I am ""test-driving"" a few others after this, please feel free to check my page here at Amazon for the others I try out (you know, for that perfect ""game fit""):)"
4,Truly enjoyable game,Not on par with Myst but still a very enjoyable game with some really nice graphics. The puzzles weren't overly challenging and some were downright too easy but all fit in well with the story line. This is the type of game to play when you just want to sit quietly and do a quiet activity. The ambient music and the settings within the game tended to be very soothing. I know that I will probably be playing it again as soon as I have forgotten enough of the solutions or I may just play it through to look at the graphics and experience the technology...
5,Masterpiece !,I have been a fan for a long time. just by accident I missed this one. I bought it recently and I have to say it is just amazing. it is a must have JMJ album. absoulute pure electronic joy.
5,This one is different,"JMJ does it again! This very interesting and versatile work was a long-awaited product that was largely influenced by transition that JMJ music underwent in the late 90s. Metamorphoses demonstrates a somewhat different approach to creating subtle electronic textures permeated by wittily designed and sequenced melodic grooves. You will not hear JMJ from late 80 and 90, instead, you will be submerged into an undemanding world of groovy chill out, ambient soundscapes, and memorable melodies. In my opinion, this album draws a line under the years of artistic development and constant exploration of electronic sound. Not too much modular synthesis here, usually heard on the previous works, but there is no artistic compromise either. The author fully explores the capabilities on new music production technologies and shows his true skill that sets him apart from many electronic musicians of the present day."
1,"Take my advice, pass this one by.","I am a mechanical engineer with 4+ years experience. I have been using Pro for about 3 years. I'm trying to gain experience with FEA using Pro Mechanica so I bought this book.First I must say that this book was very hastily put together. There are countless spelling and typographical errors. There are numerous pictures of dialog boxes that don't have good descriptions of many of the item picks. The examples are very elementary and not much detail is discussed. For example most of the constraints are fixed in all directions. In my opinion, anyone can set up a problem in Pro Mechanica with all the directions fixed, apply a load and material. I expected more for this book especially given the price. I would not recommend this book unless you are a total beginner with Pro Mechanica and can find a used one for about 5 bucks."
3,"Good points: One, I was a little taller. ...","Good points: One, I was a little taller. Two, at first, it's similar to putting on a new pair of running shoes. Bad points: One, it gave me back problems with extended wear. This is similar to the lifts that may be provided by a chiropractor. The theory is that although one type of pain may be relieved with use, the body must compensate for the physical shift. This shift often causes pain in another part of the body. Overall, this probably isn't a product I would purchase, especially not at the price."
3,My feet used to hurt all the time. ...,"My feet used to hurt all the time. Now that I put the DynaStep inserts in my shoes, my feet don't hurt as much at the end of the day. However, I don't feel that they lived up to my expectations. I'd like to find a pair that would work in my work boots, because I stand on cement all day. I'd recommend these for someone who spends more time in tennis shoes than I do."
2,I just didn't like the sport insert. They ...,"I just didn't like the sport insert. They were the right size, but they hurt the arches of my feet as I walked. I wouldn't recommend them to a friend. I like the regular inserts far better."
2,Same Story Different Author,"I'll not repeat the story outline that has been given by the previous reviewer.However, I'll comment that I only gave this two stars, due to the fact that we have had the financially poor pregnant or single parent female that was jilted or abandon by the ""rich irresponsible"" brother to only be rescued or fall in love with the ""responsible rich"" brother/cousin etc. This is the new millennium and we still have books written and published that would work well in an OLD pre-1990's regency romance (and I still think they do it better!)I can then understand the frustration of the previous reviewer with the attitude of the Heroine, it's just not consistant with the modern era.In fact to be trueful with the exception of the Jerry Springer and Rikki Lake shows, there is no one I know that has gone from one sibling to another!!! But hey (what do I know) this seams to sell well in today's romances or they (the brother/cousing/twins etc) share the heroine."
4,"consistent w/other Planet Earth, mostly favorable","if you like the Planet Earth approach to written guides, then you should find this very helpful. For me, the goal was getting much more info on 2 towns, Moshi & Arusha. This was definitely helpful, albeit still coming up a bit short on these cities' information & details. But overall info is, as always, quite sufficient."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this book from Amazon Marketplace on 8/24; it was still not here by 9/19, when I left for Africa. Frustrating!"
4,zanzibar,We are a couple of divers and we decided to go to Zanzibar for diving holidays. We took the book with us and the only thing we can say is - it's a bible for budget travelers. There are some excellent recommendations about the overnights and good restaurants. The prices in the book were fairly accurate. Important thing was that it gave us a good start in bargening. The only thing this book was lacking was some more info on island pemba.
4,Lonely Planet vs. Rough Guide,"I was traveling with friends in Tanzania. I had the Lonely Planet and one of my friends had the Rough Guide. Lonely Planet is a good book but when it came down to the book that we REALLY found indespensible and would stay up at night reading -- the Rough Guide Tanzania won. Lonely planet is good, yes, but Rough Guide contained much more cultural information. It depends on what you are looking for. We are students and we were working in Tanzania. Rough Guide was better for the daily living and budget stuff. If you're just a tourist, Lonely Planet is perfectly acceptable.The Rough Guide to Tanzania, Edition Two (Rough Guide Travel Guides)"
1,Terrible,"I gave away our Rough Guide midway through our trip to a guide that really liked it figuring I could just replace it with a digital version. Since I had already read through ,uh of the Tanzania Rough guide I thought I would give Lonely Planet a try although it cost twice as much. I have to say that their Zanzibar coverage is terrible or mostly non-existent. I had to rely on memory from the Rough guide and another friend that was with me.I would definitely recommend the Rough guide over this."
1,a difficult read for the class,"Overall, the class which I took (Roman History) did not like this book at all. Very confusing and a mess to read we had about 20 students who complained it was to detailed information, the author is NOT concise. Felt like a roller coaster reading this book. I wouldn't recommend this book at all. Poorly written as a text."
4,Good substitute,"Given that the bottom drawers are false, this armoire is the perfect size to hang American Girl doll clothes, and is MUCH cheaper than what you can buy from American Girl. Saying that, you get what you pay for, and this is not well made. It arrived with chipped paint, (inconspicuous enough but still..) and we discourage our daughter from moving it around due to fears that it may fall apart. However, she loves it, and it serves its purpose of protecting the doll's clothing."
1,You get what you pay for this,"Don't be tempted by the price ... you get what you pay for. It is very cheap construction and the photo of the product looks much better than what it really is. For example, the pretend drawers do not pull out, it is wasted space down below the clothes. The doors swing too far in which makes it look even more cheap. Once you put clothes on the hangers, the doors don't completely close either."
2,"Somewhat cheaply made, but it does the job","Like other reviews I read about it...the same thing happened to us. The piece that has the velcro that the doors are supposed to attach to was broken off when we received it. I tried, several times, with wood glue...to glue it back on. You have to line up the tiny holes to the sharp metal nails/tacks...and the thing just wouldn't work. So now we're using it with the thing broken off. I should probably send it back because now the sharp nails are exposed if you stick your hand in and up. Or I may just tape some foam on the inside. My daughter loves the toy...and I wasn't about to spend a penny more on a closet for dolls (can't believe other people have so much extra money they could afford to buy the American Doll brand). But buyer beware!"
4,Daughter so excited!!,"Our daughter got this for her american girl doll clothes. She loves it! The only problem I have with it is the doors don't always stick (magnets). But the doors look as if they are closed though and don't just stay swung open. I actually ordered generic hangers for american girl clothes, but they are too wide to fit in armoire. So double check measurements before buying extra hangers!"
3,Put together nightmare!,Putting this together was not easy. It took me over 2 hours to put it together. All the parts did not fit together right and it was a pain!!! Once it was together it looks okay and it functions.
4,Daughter loved it!,Perfect size for her American Girl Doll Clothes. Looks great and fits well with her other doll items. Would recommend.
2,"Girls loved it, but it didn't last.","It just isn't very rugged. Seems it isn't built for the right age group. It would probably last fine for older girls, who are more able to treat things delicately, but... those girls don't play with dolls anymore. Little girls that play with dolls need this kind of thing to be able to handle less nimble hands and fingers that may get a little rougher sometimes. The design is really cute and made it very popular... while it lasted."
2,POOR DESIGN,"Gave it 2 stars because it wasn't a total piece of crap, just a partial piece. Basically, it's not worth anywhere near the money I paid for it. Biggest problem was the assembly. This is not the first time we've put something together, we've assembled plenty of wood pieces for gifts over the last 5 years from various manufacturers. Several of the screws would not line up properly. Some were fine, went in with no stripping or problems. About 1/3 of the screws were misaligned & impossible to insert without stripping them & ruining the piece. Long story short...no time for return, so we ended up filling the holes with super glue to create a substance that would hold the screws to keep the wardrobe walls in place."
2,Cute...but,"It was super easy to put together and amazingly cute. BUT, my daughter broke it on the first day. The doors close and ""latch"" with velcro. The wooden piece that it closes against broke off. It was held on by little tiny nails. It popped right off and now the doors swing all the way inside the armoire. Wood Glue, here we come!"
4,Battery compartment difficult to open,Bought this for my 77 year old mother and she loves it. The only downside is the battery compartment was difficult to open. She loves the larger screen and keys and spends a lot of time playing with it in front of the TV.
3,poker game,I would have liked a light on the screen and I also would have been able to play for higher stakes. It is ok but not one of my favorite purchases.
2,Not a very good game,"This draw poker game is so-so. I have another one that is much better, so I was disappointed when I received this one. The keys are very small and the screen is dark. You have to hold it to play. I like a game that you can put on a counter or table and play without having to hold it. The screen can't be seen unless you hold it up in front of you. It is hard to win any points on this game. It takes a lot of playing just to accumulate a few points. Most of the time I lose all my points continuously, and I know how to play the game. Not recommended."
1,this is one of the worst,this game is boring. it has very limited choice of what you can do . the betting is very limited. i would like to have my money back for this crap.
2,meak attempt at comedy,"I kept waiting for the laughs to come with this movie, and they were so far and few between. And what was up with the dog and Billy Crystal? That was disgusting. just completely unneccesary and unrelated to the topic at hand. That part alone really brought this film down. This film tries to hard to be funny, and fails miserably. It also tries to be a romantic comedy with Julia Roberts, who was very good in the supporting role of Kiki.I thought Zeta Jones character was so evil, and she was great. You really wanted to see her end up badly.It was also a predictable movie, as most romantic comedies are.Although if you want to see a funny romantic comedy, watch ""When Harry met Sally"" ...Amer. Sweethearts is a total let down."
1,Runny and ineffective,"Didn't work at all! Ran all over my project and failed to hold anything together. Followed directions, but wasn't ever able to get it to do what it claims to do."
3,Ordered for personal use,"Ordered this product to repair a teapot lid. The glue held for only a few days and then came apart. It may be that the steam from the tea steeping loosened the glue. But, it did not work as we had hoped."
2,Did not work for me,"I couldn't get the pieces of the plate to stick. I even let it sit like a number of reviews had suggested. In all fairness, not sure what the plate is made out of so I might have been using the wrong glue to the type of paint that I got."
2,Not what it promises to be...,The package claims to set in 1 minute. This is far from the truth! I followed all directions and it took much longer. It took me at least 15 minutes of firmly holding 2 pieces together before it was finally set enough to let go. Some pieces didn't set the first time around and I would have to clean them and repeat. This is a VERY slow drying glue. One piece of advice I can give is it use very little glue. I found it dried much quicker when less was applied. Good luck.
1,useless,"I have been searching desperately for a glue to mend a Lenox candlestick which dropped and broke -- cleanly and in one place. The Elmer's China and Glass Cement -- well, folks, it doesn't work, i.e., it doesn't even pretend to hold the pieces together; they just do not adhere. I was sooo disappointed."
5,Wonderful stuff!,"When my dad was in hospital, I let my 16 y/o daughter cook dinner. The result was two dime size chunks broken on either side of my Bennington Pottery casserole dish. At nearly $80 to replace, I thought I'd give glue a try first. On arrival, the glue clearly states that it is not for high temperature applications. Bummer -- but what's the harm in trying. To my surprise, the glue works great, dries clear and even survived a 350 degree oven. The spot I glued was not a high-stress area, so perhaps that's a contributing factor to note. For my particular application, this glue couldn't be better!"
1,just doesn't work,"I bought it to repair broken teapot handle. Unfortunately, it completely doesn't work: it couldn't paste together both paths even for 1 sec"
3,"Fantastic blending, but not durable","We've had this blender for a couple years now. In the first 6 months, the rubber gasket got sliced up and needed to be replaced ($2) and 2 months ago, the blender jar got cracked to the point where it's leaking ($15). Even though it has a 3 year warranty, it wasn't covered by either of these problems.Overall, great at making smoothies, as long as you add enough liquid to get it going. You may have to shake/stir the chunks at first, but after that, it works great, and the ""wave-action"" really does work.I probably would've given it 4+ stars if it was more durable, or if the replacement parts were covered under warranty."
1,That sux,"This blender sucks so bad that it sprayed milkshake everywhere after it's 10th use. I make about 4 milkshakes per week, and the plastic jar is a joke. the threading at the base of the jar that locks into the base with the motor cracked and now it is a piece of trash. . . I will never own another plastic jar blender nor will I ever own another hamilton piece of beach blender. JUNK."
2,Try finding new gasket,"To replace this gasket, where the clear top attaches to the base unit, is a pain and/or expensive. I've been to three small appliance repair places... no gasket fits. I've been to the large national home repair places... nothing but generic replacement parts.As a blender, It's GREAT! To me though, it's not worth the hassel of trying to find replacement parts."
5,Love :),"Love it! Best blender I've used, shakes come out great and not watery. Haven't used the spout though."
5,This has worked great for me,"If you are like me, and like to take a lot of your pictures looking through the eyepiece on your camera instead of the live view on your Sony Alpha, then I recommend this product. Just make sure the diopter is the correct one for your vision needs. The Sony FDAECN30 Eyepiece Corrector Diopter -3 for Sony Alpha DSLR Cameras has worked out great. I can do a photo shoot without my glasses, and I love that. Installation is a breeze. The only problem someone might have is if you share your camera with others who don't have the same vision acuity that you do. If any of my family ever use the camera, I just have them use the live view feature on the Sony Alpha."
1,Not what it used to be!,"This product is definitely not the same as I have remembered it in the past. Very watery, and did not feel like it exfoliated at all!!"
3,Not the same formula,"I ordered 3 of these, silly me. I think they have changed the formula. It doesn't seem to get the dry skin off like it did years ago."
4,Pretty Feet and Hands Rouch Skin Remover.,"I used to use this product when it was in a blue bottle. It was awesome. I have been looking for it for years and considered buying the patent and selling it myself. Found it by accident when a staff person at Metropolis Spa and Salon in Princeton heard of it. I do not find it to be as good as the former formula, disappointed. However, it does still work. Unlike the blue bottle, which worked great on dry, I find it is better to take a shower, dry off thoroughly, and then use this and the dead skin comes right off. Still a great product,just not as good as it was. Bought 6 bottles and sharing with family."
3,"Good, but not as good as it used to be","My husband really liked this product, but could no longer find it in the stores. Saw it on Amazon and ordered it for him. It works well for him, but not as good as it used to be."
3,My opinion,"I am going to order more of this product because it does work. I liked the old blue bottle, what on earth made them change to this idiotic ""foot""A guest used my bathroom and then asked me if this was a sex toy. Whoever in the company suggested this, then he or she is stupid, you do not judge a book by it's cover the old package was fineThis is my reason for only giving it a 3 star"
2,My hands and feet were softer after using ...,"My hands and feet were softer after using this product, but I don't think they were any softer than they would have been if I had rubbed in a good moisturizer. The product was very messy. The packaging claims that mess is a result of rough skin rolling off, but it looked more like the paraffin in the product itself. I would not recommend buying the product."
1,I do not think that the Pretty Hands ...,"I do not think that the Pretty Hands and Feet Rough Skin Remover lived up to its promises. I have rough heels and skin on the sides of my feet, and I have tried numerous scrubs, lotions, and files to soften my feet. First of all, it took a long time to massage the liquid into my skin and wait for any skin to begin to """"roll off"""". It worked fairly well on the sides of my feet where the skin is less rough than on my heels. This product only made my heels more rough, as it could not remove all of the dead skin. It also made my hands sore. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,met my expectations,"So pleased to have finally found Pretty Feet again. Kept looking for it at Wal-Mart but was told it was discontinued. Thanks Amazon. I'm mostly a DIY kind of gal and pedicares I do for myself at home. Pretty Feet is the essential part of my pedicare routine. I love this product. Until something better becomes available, I'm a loyal customer."
2,"The first time I used this product, it ...","The first time I used this product, it looked as if four or five layers of skin were removed. It was really messy. However, after I rinsed off my feet, they didn't feel any smoother. The mess was mostly product, I think. I used it daily for the first four days, and then every other day after that. Eventually, my feet did feel smoother, but it did nothing to relieve rough spots or calluses. I would stick to a pumice stone or a lotion with alpha hydroxy. This product didn't seem to do a whole lot for me."
4,My go to hand saver,"I have been using this for 25 years and I love it. I think they might have changed the formula, because it is much thinner than before. It still sloughs away dry skin from my hands, and makes them feel soft.To be fair, I think it is a bit harder to use than before."
5,This stuff is amazing,This stuff is amazing...why isn't it available in stores anymore?I just ordered the three pack and it was exactly the same as I remembered from the blue bottles.
3,Pretty feet & hands---kind of disappointing...,After countless physical searches at numerous stores I finally googled this product I used to buy for years. Found it at Amazon (of course) I read one review of someone who said they did not think it was as good as it was a few years ago. I thought why would they change formulas??? Well--I did order a 3-pack and after a long anticipated wait I have to agree---it does seem to NOT get the great results as before!! The formula seems diluted-like....before the results were instantly dramatic---now so-so.
5,one of my favorite products,"This has been one of my favorite products for many years. Yes, it can be messy, that's because it works. Exfoliating dead skin is a messy business. I recently went in search of Pretty Hands Pretty feet at the drug store where I usually find it and found a product in a look alike bottle with similar ingredients called Peel Out, which did not work nearly as well. I was delighted to find my favorite on Amazon."
2,The product is questionable,"I first looked for reviews because I wasn't entirely sure what to think of this product. It appeared that the dead skin just crumbled off of my heels, something that looked too good to be true, and while my skin did feel softer, I wasn't sure that it was from the removal of dead skin. I think that the stuff that looked like dead skin was really the product itself after it dried, which would make sense to use it on dry feet. On wet skin, the product would never dry out to crumble.I think for the callouses on my heels to come off, I'd have to soak in something for a long time for the moisture to penetrate, not just something to be applied for a minute or two.I truly hoped that this product would work, too."
2,GOOD LUCK!,The Band Is Swingin & Bill Chase Sounds Great!......BUT... The Recording Is Very Bad! Buy It Only If Your A Chase Era Herman Fan & Can Put Up With The Boombox In The Audience Recording Technique.
4,The Moon: Myth and Image,"The book I saw elsewhere before I bought this book was (as it turns out) the Cassell's edition, which has colour illustration. This 4 Walls 8 Windows version only has black and white illustrations, though well printed. I would have preferred the colour."
2,Not much new,Identical to Heid's regular (and pretty good) iLife book with a bit of additional material added. Not what I was expecting in a separate new volume - was expecting much more of a teaching orientation that this book provides.
2,Where's the teacher?,"First, much as I admire Jim Heid, this is just a reprint of his Macintosh iLife 04 book with a chapter on teaching. The lesson plans are not really pedagogically effective since there's no opportunity for skills development, cross subject connections, or even assessment. There's no instructional purpose given--or even suggestions about fitting them into a standard curricula. I'd much rather read a book written by someone who actually used iLife as part of their instructional arsenal."
2,CANDY CANE..........BLOODY CANE!,Coeds at the exclusive Calvin Finishing School(where theyreally do finish you)are finished by a Santa-suited psycho outto avenge the accidental death of a hazing victim. This unimaginativebut presentable Christmas carnage was directed by non other thanDavid(LAST HOUSE-EDGE OF PARK)Hess and scripted by The IncredibleMelting Man star Alex Rebar. Worth a look if you got a laundrygoing.p.s.How many HORROR films are there with Santa or X-mas themesto them I like to know???
5,Hugely impactful.,"Taught me a lot about feelings, and trusting in feelings and in a relationship.I have read about 15 self help relationship books. This, and ""Conscious Loving"" are my two favorites.Buy them, for yourself or anyone you know in need of real/fundamental help and perspective."
2,"I Don't Trust An Author Who Lauds Herself As ""A Gifted Seminar Leader"" On The Book Jacket","This book is a great start for people wanting to explore this subject.However, if you have serious trust issues, the book may come across as trite and trivializing. Ms. Wall's feel-good platitudes may not apply across the board. Survivors of severe abuse and betrayal might want to look elsewhere."
2,book review,Not very helpful reading. I was not very impressed. Not recommended if you are looking for some serious infromation. The topics were very generic and did not offer solutions or clear explanations of the information.
4,Learning to be trustworthy,I recently had someone come back into my life that I lied to by omission. Our second time around he was having trouble trusting me. I told a white lie and he blew up. I was sitting there scratching my head thinking what's his problem. I decided to order some books about trust to get a handle on my issue with lying. This book has shown me why I choose to not be truthfull all the time. I am trying to protect myself from how I think the person will react by knowing the truth. I'm not trustfull or trustworthy. I this book is really helping me see a better way to be.
1,Worst product ever,The sounds are stupid and sound nothing like what they're supposed too. The quality is terrible and the product is generally bad.
4,Great machine,"I bought this sound machine for my boyfriend who has trouble getting to sleep. He used it the first night he opened it and slept all night. He slept through his cellphone ringing and everything. I even enjoy this product, and I usually fall asleep with the TV on. The sounds are all fantastic and we love the variety of choices. The rain option really sounds like rain. I woke up listening to it thinking it was real rain once. Our only issue with this product is if you keep your cell phone too close, you get noise interference coming through the sound machine, which is not soothing for going to sleep... which is what this is supposed to do."
4,"Good Product, Does the Job","It's true that as some other reviewers have noted, you can hear some of the sounds ""loop,"" but for our purposes -- we use it as a travel white noise machine for our baby -- it is quite perfect. The machine can either be plugged in using the AC adapter or used with batteries and its lightweight, relatively small size makes it great for travel. Even when the loop is noticeable, it is not jarring to me in any way. The regularity of it becomes soothing. We purchased it for around ten dollars through Amazon, which we thought was a steal."
5,Nice Machine,"I bougght this sound machine to get my son to sleep in his own bed. and it worked! my son loves his sound machine, he said it helps him fall asleep alot faster."
3,It's okay...,"The sound quality on this thing isn't very great. The built in speaker is cheap quality, so I opened it up and removed it and wired in an external speaker that sits outside of the unit. It sounds a bit better, but it seems that the quality of the recorded sounds is not very good. Too much compression or something. Anyways, I leave it on the rain setting and it does help me fall and stay asleep, since I need background noise because I work overnight and sleep during the day."
3,Good but...,"I got this for my 8 week old son because it plays white noise and ocean waves and other relaxing sounds to help him sleep, and it wasnt very expensive. It has the worst sound quality i have ever heard. Every sound option is staticky and not clear at all. I didnt pay for static and crappy sound, i paid for clear sound to help my son sleep but it was never clear! It would be great if they made the sound quality better. I would NOT reccomend this! Get a more expensive version!"
5,Good night's sleep,"Has adjustable volume and plays all night. I especially like the thunderstorm sounds, ocean waves crashing, and even the ""white noise"" feature. Great value and excellent price."
1,Didn't work after 3 days.,"Bought this because we had a similar Conair model (SU7) that worked very well for over 2 years. It was the only thing that would get our daughter to sleep through the entire night. We ordered this model because we needed the same sounds, minus the alarm clock.Should have expected problems when my first impression was how cheap and flimsy it felt out of the box (not solid like our SU7). Sure enough, after 3 days of use the sound started randomly going in and out. It isn't an issue with the auto shutoff feature or the volume control. Sometimes it works for 5 minutes, sometimes several hours. But never through the night. When it does shut down, we have to power it off and on several times before the sound kicks back in.I realize for $13 you aren't going to get the greatest quality. But you do expect it to work for more than 3 days. My advice, spend a little extra and get something better."
2,Defective?,"Worked great for about a week, then it started getting sketchy. The sound would go down on its own, or cut in and out at random times. The volume control is touchy - if it's TOO loud it stops working. Maybe mine is defective? Very disappointed."
5,Simple to use and very effective in helping a baby sleep,We bought this white noise machine for our 3 month old baby. It works perfectly. I like the big button for turning the noise on and off. This is a simple white noise machine to use and the sounds are nice to listen to.
4,Now I can sleep,"I have resorted to sleeping in the lounge next to the aquarium when I can't sleep! With the purchase of this item I find the soothing sounds eliminate the need ror a tv, fan or aquarium bubbles to help me drift off. The sound can be a bit repetitive if you listen hard enough, but so far it has been an excellent item. Price is reasonable, just need to see how long it will last now :)"
3,unit works but sound quality poor,"I've had this machine for about a year. It has held up to wear and tear in a toddler room as well as multiple cross-country flights. Unlike the Homedics SoundSpa (I've had 3 and all have a loose button that cause it to turn off/on randomly), this machine works consistently. We only use the white noise and at first I loved it but after sleeping with it myself, I realized that if you have the volume turned above a whisper, the sound quality is pretty poor. There is an audible loop and there's also a funny buzz that comes through, which I found more annoying than the loop. When I needed to turn up the volume to block out sound, I found the white noise almost worse to sleep with than the outside noise I was trying to cover.Instead of buying 3 Honedics and now this Conair, I should have bought the more expensive Marpac travel sound conditioner to begin with."
3,Looping sound is annoying,"I bought this for background noise to read and sleep at home to drown out other noises. I was disappointed with the looping sound and on nights I have trouble sleeping, this just compounds the issue. I do find it relaxing and good for reading but not as much for sleeping. If you're looking for a good sound machine, pay a few extra bucks and get the Dohm sound machine."
2,Not tested by its designers,"Most of the sound loops are very harsh-sounding and give me a headache instead of helping me sleep.The mode I got it for, white noise, is one of the worst. Other samples seem to be as long as 20 seconds, the white noise sample is about 2 seconds long. The brain is very good about picking out patterns - especially when it is such a short sample. Imagine hearing a pattern looping over and over all night long... not fun. It's sad, too, because it would be so easy to design something to generate true white noise. Maybe add some options to adjust the frequency range and you're done.My wife got one of the noise generators that is a fan with some adjustments to control the air flow. This works much better, but could be made into an electronic device that would cost less than 1/4 what that thing costs."
3,Conair review,Reasonable product for the price....background noises - ticks - if you run the same sound for overnight.....
5,Now we sleep sweetly!,"before this my wife hated me falling asleep before her, now we can sleep together cause this little dream machine covers my snoring and sends her to sleep. Awesome, great sounds!"
3,conair SU1W sound therapy silver,"I was happy with the product, I got it fast, and the packing was great. The sounds are really authentic in sound. The mother to be was very happy to recieve it as a baby shower gift."
3,"Conair SU1W Sound Therapy,Silver","OK for the price,sounds a bit hollow and short sound tracks.Simple on off button that returns to sound played last,this unit will play all night which is a feature that i wanted."
3,Battery operation,"I bought this since it could be battery operated for traveling in Europe. It had a tendency to turn itself off, and I had the auto timer turned off. I took an entire package of 8 batteries for the week since I had read that it would burn through them. I replaced the first four batteries after five nights and the machine worked find the next three nights. However, it accomplished what I needed it to do except when it turned itself off."
3,Too much repetition,"I was really looking forward to the thunder storm & rain, but it repeats too often & becomes monotonous--which doesn't help sleep. It needs more variation. I can listen to the stream successfully, however. Maybe I need less variety in sounds & longer playing time before repetion."
5,Gift for my Daughter,My daughter is a surgeon and she gets awakened a lot so noises bother her...she requested a sound therapy machine...so this was my choice...excellent choice it was...The product had many choices and is well designed and quite reasonably priced...
4,Love it!,I really love this sound machine. I have no problems with it at all. The only negative thing I have to say about it is some of the sounds sound very similar. I love the 60 minute time off button and that it is compact so I can take it with me. Great product for the price.
4,Works Better Than I Thought,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, who kept complaining that he couldn't get to sleep sometimes because the house was too quiet. I looked at a much more expensive sound therapy machine at the mall, but it didn't have white noise, which is what he said he wanted. I thought this one was awfully cheap, but figured I'd try it before investing in a more expensive one.We tried it the first night, and we weren't happy with the white noise sound, but love the falling rain and the running stream. A few days later, I ended up stealing it from his side of the bed and putting it on mine, and I love the thing! Within 5 minutes, I am sound asleep. I love the volume control too, which some machines don't have. I'm probably going to buy one for everyone I know for Xmas next year - I'm that happy with it! Great value for the price too. Goes to show you don't always have to spend more to get a great product."
2,Not inexpensive; cheap,"Other reviews on this site said that this inexpensive item, was a bargain, so I bought it. The sounds it produces are very low quality. The white noise sounds like low quality TV static. Each of the other 9 options repeat their sound within a few seconds and are of equally low quality. I have heard white noise machines that produce a much more pleasurable and substantial sound that will put you to sleep in minutes. Unfortunately, from my experience this seeming bargain was not worth the money."
1,Interference Creates Loud Screeching Noises,"The sounds it makes are fine and in fact are soothing but if you put it in a room with other electronic devices, there is a LOUD interference sound (similar to when you put a cell phone next to speakers) that occurs intermittently.We've moved it everywhere but can't figure out what is causing the interference. Because it only happens every few hours, if we go to sleep with it, we get woken up in the middle of the night with loud screeches.Unless you have a room with NO electronics whatsoever, I wouldn't recommend to anyone."
5,If you need to block out external noise,"Nice sound machine. Lots of options, including white noise which is sometimes hard to find on these machines. Love the volume control. That is a big plus. It's also fairly small so it doesn't take up a huge amount of room on my son's dresser."
3,White Noise,"While the Conair SU1W Sound Therapy functions as it is supposed to, I purchased it primarily to use when traveling and it is much bigger than I anticipated and takes up more room in my luggage than I had hoped. However, as already mentioned, it functions very well."
1,"OK, but not great","This product has a great selection of sounds, however, the sound quality is a bit fuzzy."
2,you get what you pay for,I purchased 2 conair SU sound therapy machines. Had to return one because the volume dial was defective. Sound quality not very good ... there is a definite annoying clicking sound where the tape is spliced. Was impressed how fast Amazon refunded my money for the defective item.
4,great,"I needed a sound machine for Peru, different voltage, so i got one that could use batteries, great machine, helped me with my husbands snoring. Batteries lasted the whole two weeks, a bit bulky but light enough, i carried it my hand luggage"
1,BUYER BEWARE! Defective Product.,"I bought this item during a move from one apartment to another. Therefore, I wanted something easy and portable just in case the new neighbors were loud.I got the item - IT DOES NOT WORK. I first went with plugging it in, the light turned on for about two minutes and then dimmed. I tried batteries - it wouldn't turn on at all. When reviewers said it was cheap, I didn't mind because I was looking for something just to block out some noise - but instead I'm left with a piece of plastic and a waste of space. I threw away the packaging during the move, shame on me.Don't waste your money or time on a defective product!"
1,Trash,"This product is a complete disaster. As many others have said, there is a static noise that is quite loud no matter which sound profile you choose. It happened the first time i plugged it in.Don't buy this item!"
2,"Nice try, but annoying","Features that I like:45 Minute Timer Feature but also works without a timer, running until you manually turn it off.Loud volumeMultiple soundsFeatures I hate:The bad repeat and sound choice! The white noise has an annoying squeak like a turning fan in the background, the rainforest they have an annoying coo coo bird and the rain has a very annoying loop with a background noise as well. The sounds are supposed to be comforting, but they were created out of such small loops that the little annoyances begin to out way the soothing sounds! I actually cannot use this sound machine at all, it is too annoying and ends up keeping me awake."
1,disappointed,"Read the reviews with the strange noise that will sound every so often - thought I'd give it a try, and my luck - it does make that noise every so often! I tried it with the electrical, but was even worse with the batteries! Sending it back today!!!"
2,poor sound quality,Like the other review on this product... I picked this up at Walmart for under $20. But that is all it is worth really. The sound of the waterfall / rain sound almost exactly the same. The quality of the sounds are horrible. There is some odd back ground noise on the thunder storm sound. I am still on the hunt for one of these machines that actually has a 'RAIN' selection that sounds like RAIN!! But don't bother putting any money into this brand... the sound quality is very poor.
4,Excellent sleep aid for kids,"We bought this unit for our second child; the first still uses a previous model. One of the most useful tools in the arsenal of gear for kids. Noise from the device drowns out ambient noise and helps kids sleep. Audio quality is low, but sufficient for white noise, which does the trick, and different settings provide a little variety. Can be stored on the floor and operated with a foot--nice not to have to bend holding a baby--although the volume is tougher to adjust with your toes than the power and noise selection. Don't be afraid to crank it up."
4,Great little machine,Used it to go to sleep myself and it worked great. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it seems flimsy and plasticky-we'll see how long it lasts.
2,on/off button malfunctioning,"The only sounds that are halfway decent and not grating are the ""summer sounds"" and ""white noise"" which help my baby sleep through household noises.Also, about 2-3 months after using this product, the on/off button started malfunctioning. I think the button, made of cheap plastic, is sort of stuck in its setting..."
1,Waste of money..,"I love the idea..but it was very poorly executed in this product. Everything sounds like its coming from a poorly tuned radio- very fuzzy. The sounds are not very authentic, and repeat too frequently. I don't like to sleep to the sound of the tv, but that is much more appealing than this unit. If I were to keep it, it would just take up space."
3,You get what you pay for,"The sound isn't high quality and the recordings loop frequently, but it is acceptable for the $10 I paid for it."
5,Great ocean sound,I have used this device in the past. It has the best ocean sound of the other sound devices that I have tried.
2,Thrown for a loop,"I purchased this item after reading several good reviews and also after watching a you-tube video portraying the sounds that the machine makes. After doing so, I chose this sound therapy machine to finally purchase. I was excited for it's arrival and was eager to plug it in to use to sleep that night on the ""white noise"" setting. After about 10 minutes, I had enough and turned it off. The sounds are played on a 5, maybe 10 second loop which is VERY noticeable. I plan on boxing it back up and finding out how to return it and get my money back. TERRIBLE!"
1,Didn't like this product,I bought this product to help my baby sleep at night. The sound quality was terrible and wasn't soothing at all!!
2,Not impressed,I had read several reviews before purchasing this item..was not impressed with the quality of the sounds..they all sounded alike except for the heartbeat which is the only good one. Unless you like crickets and bird chirping pick another sound maker!
3,Just one problem... no earphone jack,"I'll use this since I'm desperate, but will have to continue searching for one with an earphone jack. (I must funnel the noise directly into my ear. Otherwise I can still hear my husband's snoring over the sound machine.)"
3,Big and Ugly,"We only use this for the white noise. It was cheap and we have the same model with clock. We decided to get this one without the clock because the back light on the clock renders it useless at most angles even with the highest contrast. It is also too bright in my opinion, once your eyes adjust you'll be able to see the entire room clearly."
4,Hooray for loud enough sound machine!,"Finally found a sound machine with decent noise options that you can turn loud enough to drown out other noises at home! Those two features are what I cared most about so I really like it and use it EVERYDAY. I don't love it, however, because the quality of the different noises aren't the best, each sound like something is in the background and sometimes I think it is my baby crying. Not too bad though because those background noises are also rhythmic, so you can ignore them as long as you know that is what you are hearing.Overall GREAT purchase and I would DEFINITELY buy again, great price for so many sound options, even if they aren't the highest quality."
2,Not too great,There is only one setting on here that I could use that doesn't have the obvious repeating sound pattern that others complained about.
2,Doesn't work half the time...,"I bought this for my 11 month old daughter who needs ambient sound in order to fall asleep. I've had it for about 2 weeks now. I like the fact that it is portable because it has a place for batteries or a wall plug in, but it DOES NOT WORK HALF THE TIME! Sometimes it will turn on, and sometimes it won't. I have to keep pushing the button and adjusting the volume until finally it turns on. It has actually even shut off in the middle of the night and work my daughter up! I was running it using the plug in the wall, so it's not like the batteries went dead or anything. I do like the sounds that it has though. I only use the white noise, but the others are nice. I just wish it would actually work when I needed it to. I guess you get what you pay for, and I wouldn't doubt if I have to replace it with a new sound machine within a couple of months. Next time I will buy the more expensive one."
5,"Great product, great price","This product is great and for a great price. 8 different sounds, wide volume range."
1,conair su1w sound therapy,This item is the perfect size for a night stand. However they need to use a higher quality speaker. We only used it for 1 week before the speaker started crackling and being staticy. I refuse to use it as when it starts this noise I am unable to get back to sleep.
5,LOVE IT FOR BABY!!,"This sound machine was given to us as a gift and we can NOT live without out. We use it inour 6 month old's room when he sleeps and it is amazing. The sound of running water lulls him to sleep and he can't hear a thing because it blocks all of the outside noise. So we can pretty much be as loud as we want while he sleeps. Also, we live on a busy road and it even blocks out sirens and car horns. LOVE IT!!!"
2,Homedics vs conair,"This product is Ok. I have used the homedics brand for years but when I saw this one, it looked like it may have more options. It does has more sound options but the quality is not as good. The machine just feels cheap. It sounds poorly. I would recommend getting the homedics one instead. This conair one is definitely not worth the money!"
1,Complete Junk,The sound quality on this unit is junk. I have heard better sound from watches. Do not even think about getting this unit.
5,Great device,"As I write this, I can hear the machine making wave sounds from our son's bedroom. We bought this to replace another brand sound machine that lasted a couple of years, but broke. What I love about this device: 1) It's plenty loud; 2) It's large frontal volume wheel is easy to turn, even with a toe (weird, I know, but you never know what situations you may face); 3) The volume stays constant after turning power off and on again, which is superior to those mechanisms that are power and volume in one knob; and 4) The price; 5) It does what it's supposed to - help my infant son sleep."
5,Good Value,"This product works great. It provides several sound settings, has an easy to use volume control, and is priced fairly."
1,Cheap Trick,"My Norelco sound machine died after 16 years and can't find a repair shop. Bought this Conair hoping to hear comparable sounds but was very disappointed by the less than authentic, cheap, tinny, thin sound. Big footprint - small quality! I'll probably never use it but too much trouble to return it. You get what you pay for...or in this case, much less!"
2,"repeating sound clips, irritating, useless","This product probably works fine for babies and is quite affordable, however, the (poor quality) sound clips are only a few seconds long, which creates an annoying pattern. It's just as irritating as the noises one is trying to mask, rendering the machine useless."
5,Wow!,What a life-saver! This product does exactly what it says (for such a low price!). It is just perfect for colicky babies and anyone else who needs to drown out the world to go to sleep. The volume control and capacity is fabulous and the machine is so small and portable. I love that it plugs in or takes batteries. What a bargain!
5,obus sound machine,This is a very well made and dependable sound machine. I would rate it a 5 star item.Lulls you to sleep fast and helps you to sleep soundly.
4,good for the price,"This product is very helpful to me. I have a lot of sounds going on around me which makes it hard to sleep (i'm a really light sleeper). The first night i got this i slept through the night without waking up once. The sound quality is about what you'd expect for a cheaper product, but i haven't noticed where the sound ""loops"" yet, so it's very subtle when it does. One of the cons, it does pick up cell phone interference really easily, causing a loud buzzing noise to come through the speakers, but if you just leave the cell phone in another room it's not a problem. For the price, i'd definitely recommend it!"
3,plug,"Machine works well on batteries. The electric plug would not work. Luckly, I had an extra plug that I could use."
2,Not as good as promised,"I was really excited for this product because it had such good reviews. I love having white noise in the back ground when I am studying or reading and I got this product to use for sleeping. It is okay, but the volume control is not sensitive enough. It is either too soft of too loud even though I barely move it. Perhaps I am just to picky, but when the white noise is on I can hear a slight warble tone in the back ground which drives me nuts when I am trying to get to sleep. I still use the other sound functions such as raindrops and thunder for nice background noise to block out the noise apartment I live in."
2,"Loud, but stopped working within 6 months.","I bought this white noise machine for our baby's nursery. This white noise machine was very loud; which we needed. However, periodically it would get VERY loud, as if there was external interference. It then completely stopped working after about six months. I guess I got what I paid for, not much. I invested in a more expensive Marpac machine and it's great!"
4,"Great for drowning out noises in hotels, etc",I always set mine on white noise and take on holidays when I am sleeping somewhere new. No more hearing doors close in hotels or noises at the cottage. If you buy a noise maker make sure it has white noise - this one does. Lightweight - easy to pack.
2,doesn't always work,"We bought three of these for all our children. One worked for only two nights before the heavy static (and nothing else) started. The other ones seem to be working still, but I don't know if they'll last. I sure hope they do or else we wasted our money."
2,Cheap price cheap product,The volume is loud and that is what I was looking for since the sleep sheep I bought was to soft but the quality of the sound is really bad. It might be because of my superwoman ears but I hear clicking and beeping sounds behind the rain option and if like a tape was rolling behind the stream option. It is especially bothering me when I go to nurse in the middle of the night. It doesn't seem to bother my son however.
4,Good product for the price,Sounds are a little electronic but the selection is nice and the product is worth the price.
5,Exactly as it was described.,This is a great product for the money. You can choose from several sounds and it has a timer so you don't have to worry about turning it off.
4,Helps Sleep,"Most of the sound are very relaxing, I work nights and this helps with my sleeping. Well worth the money."
4,sleep machine,These machines are so soothing. I have to have one to be able to sleep. Have these in every bedroom.
2,poor sound quality,The sound was very low quality and not soothing at all. I returned this item and bought a sound machine in the baby section at Target that was much better quality!
1,eh,didnt get a good one and the company will not email me back if they are resending me an other one!
3,Ok...,"The sounds are this are very nice. I purchased it because I work nights and have to sleep during the day. I live off of a busy street and wanted something to hear besides the traffic. If you want the volume to remain low...it sounds really good. However, the louder you turn the volume up, the worse the ""sounds"" sound. Overall, the product is okay."
1,Conair Sound Therapy,"One of the two machines I ordered does not work properly. It produces static to start, static goes away, static comes back erratically. Since I have no idea how to return this product or contact the manufacturer, I am just keeping it and living unhappily with it."
1,Cheap product,"This product worked for TWO nights then I carefully packed it for a road trip, we got there and it was broken. Now my 9 mos old is going to have trouble sleeping in a strange environment. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Week in the sound department,"I bought this to replace a broken Brookstone sound machine.The electronic sounds do not seem as real to me as the Brookstone one did. Wave cycles too fast, etc. For the cost of RAM these days you would think they could have a sound loop longer than a second or so. The Brookstone one was about 7 seconds for a sound loop and you had to listen carefully to hear the replete. Not bad considering I purchased the Brookstone unit in 1996. No so with this unit."
1,Not good!,"Unfortunately, the loop of the sound (especially in the White Noise setting) is audible...meaning, if you are lying down and trying to relax, you will notice the end and then beginning of the loop and, instead of relaxing, you'll key in on it and end up pissed off. I'm usually more sensitive about noise issues but, when my wife noticed it, I knew there was a problem. If anyone remembers playing LPs, it is like a more subtle version of the needle getting to the end of the record. We need to get a different device soon or we'll go nuts."
1,Disappointed,"Okay. I was nervous to buy this because of the bad reviews. But there were more good than bad, so I took the risk. Big mistake. The thing is a piece of crap. The speakers are horrible. It sounds so fuzzy. Bad bad bad. It's getting sent back."
1,Terrible!!! Did not even work!,"This was a gift for my son. He opened it and was excited, but that excited quickly turned to disappointment when the darn thing would not work. We tried everything, batteries, plugging it in the wall, and it still did not work. Dont waste your money.. Avoid this cheaply made product."
3,"Decent bang for buck, can hear looping on white noise though.","I like this item, have had it a few years and it seems like a good value. We enjoy the birdsong and waterfalls, rain, and especially the crickets for that summer night feeling. However, the white noise is somewhat annoying in that I can discern where the audio loops so it creates a distracting awareness of hearing a recording, looping endlessly. I have really good hearing, though. On the other hand, when you occasionally need the kids to sleep through a movie you are watching downstairs that they might otherwise be disturbed by, or something for a snoring visiting relative, it does the job. Nothing special, but it works. I would really like a Marpac for the pure, smooth, endless (not looped) high quality white noise, but those are pricey, and on this one, other settings that are already rhythmic, like ocean waves, being looped doesn't matter."
4,Worth the money,"We've been sleeping with sound machines for years, falling asleep to the white noise. I bought two of these for my two girls and they perform as advertised. They've used them for over a month now with little complaint. My older daughter says that hers has a repeating pattern that she picks up on sometimes. I think all of the electronic ones do if you listen for them and try to pick a sound pattern out. The only way to avoid that is to buy one of the $50+ mechanical sound machines which can also have problems as they are prone to sucking in dirt and hair."
4,"For the price, it is great",This is our second Conair sound therapy. The first had a radio and clock which we never used. This has good sound without paying for frills that we did not need. We liked that it can be operated by battery for when we travel. I would purchase it again.
1,Very Disappointed,This noise maker added more sounds than what it is supposed to. I tried all sound options and the same thing happened throughout the night. My husband and I tested it in the daytime to see if sounds were not as they stated. Sent it back. Very disappointed.
1,you get what you pay for...,"Sound quality is not very good. You can hear the ""loop"" on the white noise track. It is very muffled sounding and not crisp and clear as white noise should be, actually sounds more like brown noise. Variety is nice, but tracks of water sound clunky or tinny, like something metal is rolling around in the waterfall or brook being recorded. After using a white noise app on my iPad, this is pretty disappointing."
3,"Functional, basically","It works, it was cheap. I appreciate the 60-minute auto shut-off feature. Everything is very easy to use, volume goes up higher than I'd have expected. Overall, it was worth the price I paid. My only problem with it are the recordings themselves. Several of the water sounds (waterfall, rain, stream) sound exactly alike. And these sound like simply white noise, not really water. The thunderstorm is pretty useless, doesn't give you the sense of a t-storm, heartbeat is just creepy, and the ocean waves sound like distant cars driving by. If you want something that provides a very basic white noise, you can't go wrong here. If you are easily distracted and kept awake by nuances in sounds, pick a higher quality product."
3,not quite what i wanted,i needed this sound machine to also have some background relaxing music with the sounds. It doesnt so it doesnt relax my daughter enough to fall asleep. sounds are ok but they are not really relaxing without the music background. will need to purchase something else....
3,Works as a secondary sound machine,"I bought this sound machine to keep at my babysitter's house for naptime. At home I have nicer one that plays soothing rain sounds that my baby can't sleep without. But for my sitter's house, I bought a cheaper one thinking that at $18 it would still be decent....it's not. The sounds are so muffled you can't tell what they are. Just sounds like static. But for naptime at the sitter's house, it's working OK for now."
1,Functionally fine but the sounds need help,"We've had a noise machine for Brookstone for about 10 years and love it. We bought this one to use for traveling because it is a little more compact and can use batteries. The first night when turned on it sounded fine. We usually use the white noise setting and that is what we used for this one. In the middle of the night after waking up, I was listening to the noise and it sounded like it had a chant in the background. You could hear the white noise but there were definitely other sounds behind the basic noise. At times it almost sounded as if it was talking to me. I would not buy this machine."
3,Poor sound quality,"Pros: shipment arrived on time and i liked the variety of sound optionsCon: i know you usually get what you pay for, but ive actually paid the same price for another sound machine and been much happier with the siund quality... It just seemed too muffled or something.. Less relaxing than a Homedics model we had before. :("
3,Sleep sounds,It was ok. The sound quality isn't what I expected from Conair.My daughter still likes it but I wasn't too happy with the sound.
5,Great for white noise,"Stays on the entire night and helps my seven month old stay asleep. It has several sound options, but we use the white noise option. Great for the price!"
1,the sound loops are like Chinese Water Torture,"While it does play various ""relaxing"" sounds, the relaxation is disrupted by very audible loops in the sounds. Its like Chinese Water Torture."
5,Love it for the price!,"We just purchased an expensive sound cancelling machine for my mom for Christmas and all it makes it white noise. I found this for my 2 year olds room to cancel out road noise during naps. It works great, turns up loader than I was expecting. Has a turn off timer that can be set or turned off so you can let it run for as long as you want. It also has all the other sounds that he likes to listen to, he loves the heart beat sound the most but I run the white noise for him to sleep."
2,"cheap, the sounds aren't distinct, defective","It has light and flimsy construction. Also, the sounds are not very distinct (eg. Waterfall, rainfall,stream all sound alike). The volume control was defective on my unit. I am returning it."
3,Good for value for the price,This model works well. The sounds are a bit muddy but it was tough to beat the price. Other higher priced models have a treble/ base control.
3,"Just so, so.",I replaced an older sound machine that finally quit with this one. Do not really care much for the sounds. They are just OK. The only two I use now are white noise and rain. Would not purchase again.
5,Great machine for a low price,"Has a wide range of sounds to help my husband sleep. Also is compact, so fits near alarm clock. Highly recommended."
3,"Has a few tolerable choices, but...","Needed to replace the HomeMedics sound machine that is plagued with the volume switch issues. Not a lot of options in the sub-$25 price range leaving this as the only other option. For $10 I can't complain about it, but the 'tinny' sound leaves a bit to be desired. Many sound options, but the quality of the sound makes only a few choices tolerable. The HomeMedics has far better sound but is likely to experience issues with the volume knob (crackling and cutting out) within a few months of owning."
3,cheap quality noise,it sounds horribly cheap like something I would purchase from a dollar tree... the sounds repeat every 3 seconds the storm sounds horrible... however it does its job at putting my baby to sleep so cant really complain too much
2,Sounds,Sounds doesn't sound like the real things !If I could have listen to it before I bought it I would not have wasted my money!!!
4,Continuous Play!,"Needed something that would play all night. Baby wakes up, and when other products shut off in the middle of her sleep, she wakes up to silence. Perfect for us. Does have timer option, but we don't use it.I like the volume and multiple sounds, but wish there was a ""desk fan"" option. It is a soothing sound that makes our baby sleep well."
3,Better as a child,"I remember lying down on my Memaw's bed and just listening to her sound machine. It's not what I remember, at all..which is very saddening for me. The noise on all the different profiles are annoying. White noise is the only one that's decent, but I wouldn't buy this again. My husband is ok with it, but I rather sleep in the quiet than listen to this."
2,decent machine,"I really dun know if i was expecting too much out of this machine...but its not really that great...there are just one or two sounds that u may like..like the running stream,heartbeat, tropical forest etc..the rest of them like the ocean waves, rainfall...thunderstorm...white noice...etc pretty much dont let u sleep...Also someone complained here about the alarm...What Alarm????? thats a different model which is about $20...this one is just the sounds....which sound artificial...if u are expecting a more natural sound...move on...this one is more like a radio with too much static!!"
3,Why is this now $95+,"I purchased two of these 2 years ago and need a replacement unit as one has started to turn itself off. In 1997 I paid $18.00. Although the machine is excellent, it is not worth over $95. I will shop around for a cheaper price. We use them every day in our children's bedrooms and they really do make a difference. Such a shame that the price on Amazon has increased so dramatically."
4,Adequate sound machine,"It is a well made, sturdy device. It runs on AC power with the supplied transformer, but can also run on a pair of AA batteries (not supplied). The sounds this machine produces are just adequate. I have trouble distinguishing the difference between some sounds. Others just seem useless. The volume control dial is large and prominent, and very easy to use. All in all, a good value for the price."
4,great white noise to put baby to sleep,this works great putting our newborn twins to bed or calming them down. sound quality is good and so is choice of sounds. no complaints so far.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,None of the sounds are relaxing. They all sound pretty much the same & it is nothing I want to listen to.
4,Noise Machine,"Great purchase for the price. We have one of these for both of our daughters, and they work great. Love the sounds!"
3,Not Exactly Toddler Proof,"We live in an apartment building and we use a fan during the summer to drone out the comings and goings of the other occupants. This winter however we needed another alternative. This was cheap and seemed to have decent reviews so I decided to give it a try. It was prob my own fault but my son decided to knock it on the floor a few times, it seemed to be fine until he somehow managed to get ahold of it again. I think he may have just knocked a wire loose or something of the sort but all it did was emit a high whistle. Up until then it worked fine.To sum up: good product, decent price, but keep away from children."
4,Great Value,"Great Value. Does what I need it do. No crazy lights. Its a little flimsy but for $10..I'm Happy, Happy, Happy"
4,love the variety of sounds,Many sounds to choose from.. Not crystal clear sound though.. Gets a little fuzzy as the volume goes up. I think this Is going to be good for our baby though
3,"Conair SU1 W Sound Therapy , Silver","Purchased for my husband and it seems to work for him. I find.. if he turns it up too loud, it tends to keep me awake. But maybe I just need to get use to it. We used it a couple of nights then stopped, but we are thinking about giving it another try! If you don't turn it up too loud, it doesn't seem so bad. When the sounds are kept on low, they seem to be more authentic. I find the white noise seems to be more irritating than relaxing to me though."
3,Noise machine,"At first I was very impressed with the machine for the price, but after a while on the white noise setting it began to softly pulse as though the heartbeat setting was leaking over. I still use it for travel because it is lightweight and relatively small, but wish it would give a more steady white noise."
5,Awesome,"Works, looks and sounds just like described. My daughter really likes it and it soothes her to sleep really well."
2,Not worth the money,"We have only had this thing for about 6 months and it worked fine when we got it, but soon after, the cord has a short in it or something and now I have had to throw it out. The previous one I had gotten I can no longer find but that one lasted 6 years."
5,great for grandbaby,My granddaughter has had trouble getting to sleep. This machine helps her get to sleep and stay asleep. She loves the ocean waves sound.
4,Love it!,This works perfectly for us. We use it for our baby. It is great to travel with and the white noise is great for blocking out other noises that might otherwise wake her up.
2,Broken record player...,Pretty dissappointed with this product. It plays the same few seconds over and over and over again...Kind of like a broken record player...
1,Tians Fan,Conair SU1W malfunctioned and quit working properly and effectively the very first time it was placed in service. Very disappointed. Will not purchace another conair product.
1,hand waving,and thats what i did to the trashman as he picked the product up on the curve and shouted MERRY CHRISTMAS to him !!!! and it wasnt even the holiday. thumbs down to you and your generic product
2,I don't know,"I tested it before the trip I was going on and it seemed great. The noises, the volume control...all good. I went to Europe and put the adapter on the device and it blew out. I have to honestly say that I do not know whether that was because of my adapter, the hotel room, or the device. I was just pissed that I traveled to Europe with this heavy decive and it blew. Just sharing."
2,Blahhhh,Blahhhh is the best I can say. I was not impressed at all. There is nothing more to add. Sorry
5,Just bought my second one!,"I have no complaints! This has been the perfect solution to helping my 1-year-old and 3-year-old (who is a VERY light sleeper) share a room and not wake each other up. We use the white noise setting and they love it! We live in a very small condo and don't have to worry so much about making noise throughout the house while they are sleeping because the noise machine drowns it all out. It is very lightweight and easily portable. We take it to hotels, grandma's house, and anywhere we put the kids to sleep. This is an amazing deal for the price!"
4,Great for the price,"We bought this instead of the expensive sleep sound machines for our babies room. The quality of the sound isn't near as good as the White Noise for Babies album we bought on iTunes, but it does he job just fine (and we don't need to leave our phones in the room to play the white noise). There are several sounds to choose from, but since the nature ones sound weird on this, we just use he basic white noise option. Sounds just fine!"
2,get what you pay for,"I paid 20 dollars for this thing... and then Amazon dropped it to $10, not going to fool with returning.. I need some kind of noise to sleep, and for many years used a similar product, same price...but, it bit the dust recently... So I bought the Conair...the sounds are terrible and repeat ever 4 to 5 seconds, even the ""white noise"" loop is about 4 seconds on the one I received, and it has a ""clapping"" sound at the beginning of the loop..... may be worth $10... but I going for the Marpac this time...."
4,Pretty good for the price,"We had to get a second noise machine for our nanny share. I primarily use the Graco Sweet Slumber sound machine for my baby room and it's great. I love it, it has great sound quality, but it is more expensive ($40) so if you need a good option for less money, the Conair Sound Therapy sound machine is pretty good. It has a nice selection of sounds, including white noise, as well as a timer function (which I haven't used) but it can also stay on indefinitely and runs on either batteries or can be plugged in. The sounds are a little tin-y when you turn the volume up, but again, you get what you pay for. If you have the money, get the Graco sound machine. But the Conair does a fine job as a secondary noise machine for our nanny share and travel."
3,pretty good for price,Its a decent/average noise machine. Good enough I'm buying another for my 2nd kiddo. If you're on the fence its worth the chance for the price.
3,Good when it works!,We are on #2...the first one lasted maybe 3-4 months with heavy use which is really ridiculous if you ask me. We'll see how #2 works out...big fan of the ocean waves and I can even hear them when we have doors opened at night - it's like staying at the beach! HA
1,Died in 8 hours,"Wow. Some of the other reviews were right. I used this product for the first time last night. I chose the ""white noise"" setting. In addition to white noise, intermittently I also heard two varieties of rhythmic clicking sounds, not too bad, but I did tend to wake up when the sound shifted. In the morning, the unit died. It wasn't on a timer, I checked the cords and tried a different outlet, but the thing is dead as a doornail. This is the first item I've ever returned to Amazon. My last sound machine, which is a few dollars more, lasted over ten years. Disappointing."
4,GREAT SLEEP THERAPY,"I have just undergone breast cancer and a mastectomy. I saw this conair sound therapy machine in another magazine for $20.00 more and almost ordered it. But, I checked on Amazon.com. For a little over $15.00 I cherish it. When I am in emotional, physical, and mental pain, this machine is very soothing. I am in chemotherapy and taking lots of meds right now. I read my bible after my treatments and select the sound therapy of my choice and it helps me to relax and really escape what I am going through right at that time. This was the greatest little investment I made for a time like this. I have another surgery coming up in November and I will take it to the hospital with me this time."
4,Conair SU1W Sound Therapy - works great in my son's nursery,"I bought the Conair SU1W Sound Therapy machine to replace:The First Years Sounds for Silence Nursery Premium Sound Machine. The First Year's machine was a waste of money and total JUNK. Currently we use the Conair Sound Therapy machine in our son's nursery.Here is why I like this machine better:- Better sound options (we like probably 8/10 options vs. only 1/6 options on the First Year's. machine)- MORE sound options- Quality of sounds are better (admittedly not as good as they could be, but still far superior to the First Year's sound quality)- It is currently about $10 cheaper than the F.Y. machine- My husband and I are now jealous and want to get one for our own bedroom! :)I'm sure there are better machines out there that cost more money, but for those of us who are on a tight budget, the Conair Su1W Sound Therapy machine does just fine. I would definitely recommend."
1,Flimsy piece of junk,"This unit sounded okay, at least, good enough to help me fall asleep. But the second night, when I went to turn it on, it had stopped working. Broken after one night! Spend a bit more and get something with better sound that will last."
3,Good enough...,"The product was good enough. It's not bulky and has a good number of sounds to choose from. The problem I have with it is the volume. When I adjust the volume knob slightly, there is a dramatic increase/decrease in the volume which does not correspond to the volume change that I want."
2,"If sleep is important, spend more than this costs.","Pro:Lots of SoundsCons:Sound Quality is PoorTerrible Hum When Using the AC AdapterSound Sample Is To Short Which Makes the Repetition AnnoyingThis is my first sound machine, but I have quickly learned I need to spend more to get something worth having. I read much of the same with all the sound machines under $100 but figured I would take a chance."
3,Sleep Sounds,"I bought this for my girlfriend who wanted something to break the silence. The only one that actually sounds decent is the one that sounds like crickets. She loves it, I hate it. It would probably be best for little kids or babys."
3,Glitch in the programming,"All of the noise options on this machine are nice and block sound very well. However, after about 1 hour of soothing sound, our machine makes a horrible noise and wakes us up out of a deep sleep. I thought I was going CRAZY until I read the reviews on amazon.com. Someone else said their machine made the same kind of noise--a loud buzzing sound. I'm going to try to take mine back to Target."
2,"Only 1 alarm clock ""sound therapy"" setting available.","I was disappointed to find that when using the alarm in [SOUND] mode, the only possible sound setting is ""Running Stream"". The other 9 sounds can be used only in sleep or sound therapy mode.Some of the product advertising is false or inaccurate. One cannot ""wake to the sensation of birds harmoniously singing"", but rather only the default ""Running Stream"" setting."
3,Subtle repeating sound,"My husband uses the white noise to help him sleep. Unfortunately, I hear a subtle repeating sound behind the white noise that my mind focuses on. I find it a bit of a nuisance, but if he sleeps well, that's enough for me!"
4,Good,It soes not stay on all night it starts beeting after 5 hours. However the 60 minute shut off works great!
5,Brings togetherness,We love this music CD - the songs are so great. My older son is 4 1/2 and he LOVES the I Love Yoy Trains dvds. I thought how awesome to bring those wonderful songs into the car and enjoy them all the time. It makes us happy to sing along w/ such wonderful songs and music. The boys just love it.
4,Choo Choo Music,"I ordered this CD for my three year old son after seeing how much he loved the I Love Toy Trains DVD's.I Love Toy Trains DVD Parts (1-3)He was so excited when I gave it to him, and he wanted to listen to it right away. He loves to listen to it when we are in the car. Track number one has a great train bell sound effect that he loves, and ""Choo Choo Blues"" is one that he loves to sing along to. I plan to look into more James Coffey music for my son."
5,Our son adores this engaging and happy music!,"Come Ride Along with Me is a wonderful collection of music for children. I purchased it a month ago, and our four-year old son asks to hear it constantly. He sits on our kitchen counter and sings along at the top of his lungs. It is a sight to see. I believe that James Coffee is one of the most talented artists of children's music I have heard in a long time. Our son keeps asking if he can meet him, and we're waiting for another CD to come out. We highly recommend this music as part of your child's collection!"
3,Enjoyable but nothing stunning,"This album is fine but there is no one song on it that really catches my attention. Whereas some of the songs on ""10"" I can listen to over and over again, there is nothing like this here. Maybe it will grow on me."
5,Mushmouth plays with pashion,"Mushmouth plays with more energy and meaning than any band I have heard, except for Hatebreed. Buy this CD, the music is great and the lyrics are fantastic."
4,BRUTAL P.A. HARDCORE,THIS IS WHAT HARDCORE IS ALL ABOUT.INTENSE!YOU HAVE TO CHECK THEIR LIVE SHOW. P.A. HARDCORE AT ITS ABSOLUTE BEST.LONG LIVE MUSHMOUTH.
3,I'm still trying to get used to these ...,"I'm still trying to get used to these shoe inserts. My legs still ache after wearing them, so I'm gradually increasing the time I wear them."
3,I used the sport inserts in my running ...,"I used the sport inserts in my running shoes. I liked the extra cushion they provided during my runs. However, when I wore my running shoes for everyday walking, the inserts made my heels sore in certain spots. I'll continue to use these inserts for running only. I'd recommend them to my family members who are runners."
4,I used these while walking on the treadmill ...,"I used these while walking on the treadmill and while taking an aerobics class at my gym. I had never used a shoe insert before, but I really liked these. They were comfortable after the first few minutes of getting used to them. I felt I had an extra bounce in my step as I exercised, and had no foot or leg pain when I was finished. I'll continue to use this product."
3,Review of Yukon Cable Crossover,"This was the cheapest cable crossover machine I could find with all the features I wanted.The quality is average. Residential quality. What I expected. However, the quality of the paint and finish was poor. A lot of paint chips and areas of surface rust. Not what I expected from a new unit."
4,MP101 not bad,"It works. Have to reboot a couple of times for it to get IP address from my DHCP server (router). Tried Twoky server first, but it's really flakey and has a bad UI. The Netgear server works fine, connection stays on for hours. However, when a connection breaks to a radio station, the box gets into a state (skipping a song), which can be gotten out of only by rebooting. The sound is good on a high end stereo (Krell). I am thinking that the idea of a remote with a display is better, however."
3,not too bad ...,"When I first saw this book is seemed very interesting. It's not too bad, but if you want alot of dragon magick, rituals, and spells, you are in for a disapointment.This book is alot of history, a chapter on basic rituals and the normal stuff found in magick books about stones, herbs, and such. I was a bit bummed out after I read through the book. I did expect a bit more in terms of ritals, not the same stuff I can read in other books."
2,Feel cheated,"After reading books 1-4 I began to get the feeling that this series was going nowhere, one book being very like the next and by the time I finished Dancing With Dragons (gullible me) I realized I had been had. Lots of guts and gore but no real plot or even a point that would engage a reader and static characters. I suspect the only place Mr. Martin is going with this series is to the bank. He won't get the chance to fool me again, however."
1,"Good grief, another Hack writer cashing in on Wicca!","If I had the option to, I would permanently ban Conway from ever writing another book. She gleefully displays her lack of knowledge on a plethora of topics, from basic Wicca to Ceremonial Magick, to history and mythology, and the list goes on and on. If this book were shelved under fiction, it would be better, but it purports to knowledge that is obviously made up on the spot, with no historical references cited.In short, buy the book for a chuckle. Serious practitioners of the Craft and the Art should look elsewhere for instruction."
3,Good for a guideline but nothing authentic.,"I have read quite a few 'Craft' books but this one ranks up in a term used locally as ""Crystal Weenie"". The book gives great imagery for using Dragons in Ritual but to make such claims as 'Dragon Language'(which just happens to have the same number of letters as in the english language) is a little much. The charts for incense and gems have nothing to do with the book and the same charts(or the like) have been in many other books, mainly the ones about incense. I would suggest using the book for ideas about Rituals but never as a 'branch' of Craft in itself."
4,"Good, but it's not a tradition!","I grew up talking with dragons, unicorns and such things. Actually, I didn't realize that others didn't. If you want information on working with dragons, this is a great book for ideas. But I want you to remember to relate to them and all in your own way. Nevertheless, read this book!"
4,Great For A Dragon Magick Beginner,"I found this book to be very useful when I was first starting out with Dragon magick to get a feel for this unique individual craft, (I would also recommended her follow up book, Mystical Dragon Magick.)Although the experienced might find this book to only cover the basics and be disappointed."
2,Auther is somewhat contradictive,This Book is ok But before warned the auther is someone contradictive First she state's one should never cast a spell on someone with out there concent. (which to me is has alway's a bunch of Bull anyway) then she turn's right around and state's she would not hesatate to cast spell's on thief's law breaker's etc Did she get there permission ???!
2,Conway at his hmmm shall we say SELF,"One thing I will never understand. if you are the way you are becasue you eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and pretty much devulge that as you talk in text and smash your computer chair. for thoes of you in the glutton range go out to pasture please... for those of you reaching and just starting this might b a starting point ""IF"" you are you. if you are not you then please post hast go away. and say MOOOOOOO like most ok the other people posting here.... :P and MM and that would be merry meet not merry meat like the bovine people here eat and eat and eat all day along with the other pasteries : )"
3,well......3 1/2,"its alright at best. The information on dragons as far as history goes is all well and good but the ritual is a bit elementary and basic. Almost everything rhymes which kind of gets old. The thing which really irritated me however was the over abundance of tools the author claims one needs to work with the dragons. Among them are two patens(altar pentacles)not just one......I dont think a dragon is going to care if you are holding on this paten or that paten or any at all. Tools just arent necessary. If you want to work with dragon magic then go out in nature and commune with them. I also find the authors claim that dragins only exist on the astral level to be odd. Dragons are here, on earth, in the physical body, in the flesh, in this time and plane. The only reason I say 3 1/2 stars is the history and illustrations, both of which ar well written."
1,Needs to be in a different category,"I would have less of a problem with this book if it was just a breakdown of all the dragon lore and history, etc. Honestly the magic element felt contrived to me, like someone said ""Hey, dragons are in...Let's make a dragon magic book-after we finish these two on ninja and pirate magic.""I know part of what makes anything metaphysical work is the power of belief and just putting good energy into things buuut...this makes my bullhonky detector go BEEP BEEEEP BEEEEEP! I guarantee you these cantrips were engineered by the publisher/author, and not 'real' spells passed down from parent to child, master to apprentice over the eons."
2,Weak Wicca with Dragon Imagery,"Take basic baby Wicca. Add dragon images. Stir it all together like paint or a bad mocha. End of book.Dungeons & Dragons literally has a better draconic cosmology. Any skilled practitioner of an established occult system could cast better spells with a D&D; book and their pre-existing discipline.Avoid this book, unless you simply wish to add to your established collection of ""all books that include dragons"". The second star is because it does have some cute pictures, and details that could be added to a fantasy roleplaying game."
5,"How true , How true !","In an attempt to search out the ""mysteries"" and challenges of this thing we call LIFE and the mysteries surrounding it,I happened upon this book in my first attempt at""the other side""..and found that D.J. has done an excellent job.At 53 years old,I FINALLY had contact with my first Dragon! Thank you D J !"
1,"Late, late, late",As the title states the product arrived too late for its intended purpose despite being ordered in plenty of time . The company did not even apologize or offer a lame excuse.
5,spike talks agene,i love the caricter mr thick nose and like i said before sike talks agene.ps.....i love to eat pizza wall i wach this movie
2,Umm....,"Okay then. This is one freaky episode. Doesn't anybody know what SNOW is? Littlefoot has getting really annoying, Cera seems more like a pre-school nerd, Petrie is having some issues with trees, and this dumb charactor named Mr. Thicknose is really living up to his name. All in all, this is one stupid episode."
3,BEWARE OF THE ADOPTION ISSUES!,"This title can be very disturbing for adopted kids because of the subplot involving Spike leaving his adoptive family and going ""where he belongs"" (with other spike-tails). Be sensitive to these issues and be prepared to address them if you are showing this film to adopted children. PLEASE!!!"
4,The Land Before Time the Big freeze,Good stuff my son (2 years old loved it). It was brand new and in perfect condition.
3,Finally a good Epsiode!,"This epsiode was mildly amusing with good songs, and a nice story plot. The introduction of snow was a perfect idea to do and this got the story going. ""Family"" was a great song about your family and finally gave Ducky's Mom her singing debut and I give a huge thank you to ""Tress Macneille"" for her job well done. ""The Mad Song"" was a complete waste of time. So the subplot involved Ducky getting really angry at Spike for kinda being really dumb and with Cera teaching Ducky this ddn't really work at all. The best was saved for last :The Lesson"" gave the new charactor Mr.Thicknose his singing debut even though he can't sing at all. Finally, the plot was mildly amusing with a little humor. All in All, this episode was pretty good."
1,"Nope, bad sequil.","Sorry, but this is not a good one, I say it's just a repeated verson of the 7th one. Nothing can replace the 7th one. Nothing!"
2,Too Short,"This movie felt as if it were way too short, it felt like there was no time to get to know or get attached to the people. And did anyone else think that Dustfinger would have made a much more interesting main character? Told from his point of view the movie might not have felt so scattered. The story was never really fleshed out and the characters weren't given time to develop. Great premise but badly handled, presumably by the editors. Maybe the first book should have been broken into two movies? All in all, yet another disappointment produced by the movie industry based on a really really good book. Why do I keep watching them?"
1,bah! so disappointing,"I have to wonder what the author thinks when they watch a movie like this, which to my husband and I was just butchered! There were so many things that were completely different than the book, and the characters were cast horribly. I just wouldn't bother!"
2,"Interesting concept, but lame story","The concept was interesting, especially the idea of flawed readings, but the story became lame really fast, the chief symptom being the villain's lame name. Actually, many names were lame - Capricorn, Dustfinger, etc. Bad harbinger of things to come.The movie itself was surprisingly tedious and unexciting. The climactic battle was no exception, and the scene of Elinor riding out on a unicorn was far from awe-inspiring; it looked silly. And a plot point there didn't make sense - Meggie starts reading something that's not in the book, then forgets that she could do that and has to actually write on her arm.I appreciate the author's intent of making books attractive and interesting, but if this is the kind of movie that comes from books, it's a lost cause."
2,twaddle,"Another pathetic attempt to get kids interested in reading. Although beautifully photographed, it's simply impossible to get past the central premise."
4,"Not Bad, worth watching",This was a pretty good movie. The whole idea about that you could read characters out of the book was a great idea...Something no one has ever created a movie about before.
3,Inkheart,"Not a bad movie, great if you're looking for something you don't have to think too hard about."
4,A Fun Fantasy,"I am a fantasy movie lover and this one does not disappoint. It is fairly predictable, but I don't usually mind that. I love Brenden Fraser in just about anything. This movie has a storyline I have not seen before and I highly recommend it."
1,Don't Bother !,"I only borrowed this from our local public library. Apart from the cost of gas to get there, watching this movie was free for my family. I wish I hadn't bothered.Absolutely the worst movie that I've even seen Brendan Fraser in. Badly written, badly acted (Fraser and Helen Mirren phone-in their performances) and full of plot holes and inconsistencies. I lost count of the number of times my youngest child asked ""why would he/she/they do/say that ?"" I couldn't answer, because it just didn't make any sense.So a note to the stars of this movie: if you didn't just take the roles for the money or as a favor to the director/producer, you might want to seriously consider firing your agents."
1,disappointing,"I had just finished reading inkheart the book and I thought I would love the movie ! I was very sadly mistaken this movie was not much like the book pivital points and scenes where missing ,mixed up,changed, or altered ! it was sooooo different that it was ridiculous i was so upset! don't waste your time"
1,Very disappointing,"I am a big fan of the Inkheart series, so I was very excited when I learned that this movie was coming out. I was EXTREMELY disappointed! The movie is VERY unlike the book, for one thing. And it's SO hard to follow!! Don't bother watching this!"

2,Not the worst but I've seen better.,"This movie was alright, but nothing to feature on the 6:00 news. One of the biggest red flags is that it changed the story a lot, and that's never good in a movie. Another thing is I found the soundtrack a bit lacking, and sometimes the plot's tough to follow.On the plus side, it has an amazing cast (Brendan Fraser, Helen Mirren and Jim Broadbent come to mind) and it does have it's humorous moments.If you read the book and loved it, Id say don't see it. If you read the story and hated it, maybe you'll see something better in this movie. If you haven't read the book, go for it.Hope this helped."
3,An OK Movie,"Of course, the books are always better and I would definately have to agree about this movie. The book, Inkheart, is way more detailed. The movie is to rushed and doesn't expain the book to clearly. I would recommend you reading the book before seeing the movie."
5,Extremely entertaining family film!,"I highly recommend for anyone looking for a wonderful, imaginative family film. The concept is enough to get any book lover excited, and this book lover was thrilled! I have not read the book(s) yet, but plan on it soon. I hear the movie was ""Americanized"" and not sure what the reviewer meant by that, however, if it was altered slightly or not, I loved it as did my entire family. The ending was a bit scary (maybe for any child under 5) but other than that, it was a minor short scene and shouldn't cause too much of a fuss. Our 6 year old didn't seem upset in the least...it was a favorite part, to be sure. Give this fun film a try!"
4,Inkheart Heartfelt,"I liked this better than the book (I disliked the way the lead book character came across). this was immaginative and interesting as a movie. the acting was OK but overcome by special effects. Still, overall well worth the veiwing."
4,"Good film, though with some flaws","For a family film, this is one of the better ones that I've seen recently--it allows for imagination and scariness without bloodshed or overt violence, and the characters are pretty well drawn. There are some continuity issues (one character is two miles from the castle after running a couple of minutes, for example), and it's a bit too heavy on cliches for me to give it five stars, but all in all it's well worth watching. We enjoyed it, and I think that if you just suspend disbelief and watch it for fun, it will be an entertaining film. It won't be one that will hold up to heavy analysis, though!"
4,Quick and exactly as described,I love this movie. The movie was exactly as described and it was received quickly. A very happy customer.
3,Inkheart,This is an escape film that draws you into the storyline. Those who like Brendan Fraser will really like this film.
2,"Good actors and actresses, but nothing else...","Although this film has a lot of good actors (Jim Broadbent, Paul Bettany) and actresses (Helen Mirren, Jennifer Connelly), and that the plot may appear interesting (a man who has the ability of making the stories that he reads, as well as its characters, come to real life), it really isn't.After the first 30 or 40 minutes of the film's beginning, it becomes truly boring, and that feeling doesn't leave the movie until the end of it."
1,Technical Difficulties,"This is not a review of the movie, but of the streaming experience.In a word, horrible. There was constant pausing and pixellation. On the other hand I callled customer service and got my money back. Was able to rent the DVD from a local brick and morter Blockbusters."
3,The Light Darkly,"Like many Frasier films this one seems to fall into 'the very good, but could be so much better' category. Almost exceptional writing with excellent and near empathic acting which should work so well, and does to a degree, yet...One enthusiasticly ambiguous thumb up."
4,Inkheart DVD,"This movie is a lot of fun! There is plenty of action and the plot I found to be quite clever. I like movies that entertain, hold my interest, and have a good ending. This movie fit the bill for me."
3,Good FX,"I like Brendan Fraser as an actor so I rented Inkheart. The story is unique and well played with beautiful CG effects. The supporting cast is good and work well into the story and with each other. I'm not sure how the daughter came to have an British accent, especially since she grew you with her American father after mother dissappeared when she was very young. Still, it's a nice fantasy film with a splash of adventure and magic."
3,movies,"This movie came as billed and is a good movie. I normally don't do reviews because of the volume of movies I see but this movie is great because I'm a big Helen Mirren fan. Good movies, good business, Thx's Amazon.."
4,I loved the books,"So I had read the first two books in this series and thought they were wonderful. Why directors/movie writers butcher the books when they make them into movies...I will never know. I saw Brendon Fraser on a talk show when he was promoting this film and thought it sounded interesting. Had the movie been as good as the book, maybe there would have been 3 movies. It is worth seeing if you liked the Inkheart book."
5,Great movie!,"I love Brendan Frasier! Anything he does is great! The movie is awesome, encouraging others to read knowing that you can make the book come alive for yourself."
2,"Totally different from the book, and not as good.",The book is wonderful and unfortunetly the DVD is very different. Not even similar. Don't waste your time with the movie but be sure to enjoy the book.
2,Works well until it breaks...easily,"Spend $5 more at the depot store and get one with a metal screw. The plastic ones break very easily. That is all, friends."
3,"Worked for a season, then broke","I'm a pretty serious amateur gardener and I just replaced this sprayer. It worked with frequent use for about a year, then over the winter, all the metal parts seized the trigger broke when I tried to use it this spring. On the positive side, it is comfortable to use and the selection of different spray types is great. If, however, you want something that will last, I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Didn't last a month!,"This was great while it worked, but broke within a month of purchase. I'll stick to metal for the next one."
2,Not Good,Bought it in May of 2010. Did not use it from November to April. That gave it a life span of 7 months before it became uusable. Spend a few dollars more for a one more sturdy.
4,great water pressure,"i bought this sprayer specifically to spray down my car between washes and it works great! i just use the jet spray and all the gross bird poop disappears. i also tested out the other patterns and they are also really useful. the spray nozzle itself has a good weight to it, the grip is not too uncomfortable and it feels natural to trigger. since it is plastic though, i think i will take another reviewer's advice and bring the nozzle inside next winter to keep it safe."
1,fine until it broke,"I used this in my laundry room for a year or two, when the head came away from the handle. Very poorly manufactured."
1,Broke after a year or two.,"Worked fine for a season or so, then broke. I took it apart, the inside was completely corroded and unfixable. I've had similar experiences with other Orbit brand garden products. They're cheaply priced and cheaply made. I would highly, highly recommend the Bon-Aire Original Ultimate Hose Adapter instead of this. I just bought one and it's built rock solid.Bon-Aire Original Ultimate Hose Nozzle (Aluminum)"
2,Leaked,I really liked the features but this guy leaked. Perhaps another washer would have done the trick but I didn't have one.
3,Decent product,"This is a decent product... it works, has some nice nozzle selections and was priced accordingly.As far as build quality... it's not the greatest, and the front nozzle drips about once every 6 seconds, not a big deal, but enough to get it 3 stars."
3,I got what I paid for,"I bought this nozzle at the beginning of last summer (May 2011). I was very pleased with it last year: it had all the settings I needed and seemed well-made. Unfortunately, it broke at the beginning of this season. Granted, it was under $10, so I should have perhaps expected that it wouldn't last very long, but given that I use it infrequently, I didn't expect to need to replace it already."
5,Has the feel of something twice the price,"I mostly use the shower and mist function, the Jet for some cleaning.Overall awesome."
4,Spray nozzle for hose,This worked fine for a couple months and then the metal part that allowed me to not have to squeeze the trigger broke. I still use it but it is not the best.
5,Great product value,"This is exactly what I was looking for. Ease of use, great variety of settings, and my kids and I love the Mist setting to cool ourselves off. It completely suits all of my garden watering needs."
3,You get what you pay for,"The quality is average. I would be surprised if it lasts more than a summer.But I paid less than $10 for it and it is still working. If you want something that lasts longer, this isn't a good choice."
5,"So far, so good","Seems to work well. As with other products of this type, only time will tell if it is durrable enough to hold up long-term."
2,Great until it breaks,"I loved this sprayer when I first received it. The variety of spray choices filled every one of my requirements. It two months of daily use for me to change my mind. The plastic parts that form the spray handle completely broke away from the nozzle. I sigh. I wish I had spent more money to buy a sturdier model. I toss this one into the trash. ""They"" just don't make things like they used to!"
2,Wasteful,Don't bother with this one! Get the Dramm. I have purchased several of the wimpy sprayer listed here and all have broken within a very shsort time.
2,Not well made,"I purchased this in May 2011. One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months, so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types. The nozzle worked well in the beginning, though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years. After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop. Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
1,Poorly made,"This item worked fine when I received it, but after 2 weeks of light use, the screw that connects the handle to the valve became stripped and the nozzle wouldn't work. I'd return it, but it's not worth the effort and shipping cost..."
1,BROKEN ON ARRIVAL,"This nozzle arrived broken ... whether you are squeezing the handle or not, the water runs through as if you are all the time. It wasn't dropped or anything like that - I removed it from the packaging and took it out to water my flowers only to discover it wouldn't stop the flow of water."
2,"Great, then a close range sprinkler!","This nozzle was fantastic for about two weeks! No leaks anywhere, settings worked perfectly.Then the leaks kicked in. Around the gasket at the bottom, where the handle meets the head, around the turret. For $6, it's pretty much what I should've expected. Maybe some have had better luck?"
3,Better than others,"To compare with other plastic pistol, this unit is better. After all it's cheap and it's light plastic and don't expect to last forever."
3,Great for entry level jobs - NOT for management positions,"This book seems particularly well suited for applicants in the service and hospitality industry, sales, trades, and entry-level corporate positions.However, I would NOT recommend this book as a resource for people seeking corporate jobs at above entry level. Though this book offers several examples of resumes for middle and senior level management, they are very outdated and pretty uninspiring - definetly NOT what you should model your resume after if you are seeking a management postion or working with a headhunter."
5,Really good reference guide for beginners.,"This was the book my teacher had us buy for an Intro to Painting class. Gives you all the basics, i.e. what materials to buy and how to start. Thank you to my teacher for finding a reasonably priced book that did the job."
3,Same as above.,"Same as above. Didn't really begin this hobby as stated above, but intend to give it another shot come spring."
5,It's okay.,"I order three books Acrylics for dummies, The Acrylics Book by Barclay Sheaks and this one.I bought three different books because i figured they would all have something the other one doesn't have or something different.I was very attached to the other 2 but this one not so much.It did go over everything and a little more. I would recommend this book,It's still a good read."
2,"Pretty book, not instructive","This book would be good for someone to read through if they wanted to learn what acrylic painting was about, but there are no real projects in the book. Pretty pictures though."
4,"Nice Intro to Acrylic, but...","Not a whole lot of additional information about painting in general. Is great as a broad overview, lots of examples. It just didn't go into too much detail about anything, and technique was hardly covered."
1,It looks like very little info on only 72 pages,It shows big pictures of paint with very little information. If you are starting out in acrylics Acrylic Revolution is way better. Don't waste your time.
3,pros and cons,"The pan is solidly constructed, and looks attractive. It heats up quickly also, and washing is easy. The only problem and annoyance is that the handle for the glass lid gets very hot, as does the main handle after a while. Having a glass lid is convenient, not being able to open and close it without getting a potholder or kitchen towel is very interruptive."
5,it's a saucepan,"It works, it cleans. I use the it almost every day and it stays in excellent condition. What more could you want from a 1 qt. saucepan? People complain that the cover gets hot. I've never had a saucepan cover that didn't. Gotta invest in a potholder. I do like the glass lid - can see in without taking off the cover - saves wear and tear on the potholder! And it fits well."
5,Great product,I purchased this when it was on sale the firat time. I was glad to see it return to the sale price and snatched it up. Great pot for the full price. But for this price it is a steal.
4,Adequate for two,"A one quart saucepan is just right for simmering or reheating two servings. I use it for vegetables, canned soup and left-overs. It heats evenly and has a nice design. Quick to wash and takes less storage room. Good for ""empty-nesters"" who don't need to cook large quantities. If you cook for a crowd you probably don't need a one quart."
3,Glass lid not tight,"The glass cover, which is quite attractive, could be better constructed. It is not tight enough on the saucepan and allows spurts which mess the stove top and, I believe, adds to cooking time; steam escapes. I love the saucepan's construction and ease of cleaning/handling."
3,don't buy,I generally love caphalon butthe stainless steel collection is rather poor. Not easy to clean everything sticks to it.. Only good for liquids. And this pot is the smallest ever! and really heavy to lift!!
2,Very disappointed!,"My 3 year old daughter received this doll from Santa for Christmas. She loves baby dolls and stuffed animals, but does NOT like this doll. She has had it 10 days and has yet to play with it. Last night I asked if she wanted it on her bed with her other ""babies"", and she replied ""No! I don't like that doll. I want to give it back to Santa!"" I have to say that I don't like the looks of her either. She is somewhat cute with her thumb in her mouth, but with it out, her mouth is wide open and deep, and with her wide open eyes she has somewhat of a haunting/scary look not evident on web site photos. She is very heavy with a huge tummy, and her head droops and wobbles around when you sit her up. Hair is an unnatural platinum with choppy layers that will just end up getting all frizzy. Jaden is not what I had expected, and absolutely not worth the money. (FYI, We do have 2 older, smaller Middleton dolls my other girls are happy with.)"
1,Definately police only,I actually bought this book because one of the descriptions I saw said something about military and spec ops trainers as well. The author apparently was in the military but the book has little if any application for our needs. So if you are looking for somthing to suppliment your MOUT training this book is not it.
3,I had hoped it would be perfect... But....,"It only takes the paper Dixie cups and they can only be loaded from the top, which is a pain... They fit so tightly that by the time you put enough pressure on the cups to pull them out, you squeeze them shut...So... Since, I like the shape/quality of the holder, and the idea of it, I left the Dixie cups in place, and simply stacked others (slightly larger plastic cups) on top of them... It works, is not unattractive, and it's easier to get the cups...However, had I played with one first, up close and personal, I would have passed...;0))PK"
2,Cups to fit please,"It's really a nice small cup dispenser, but unfortunately i could not find cups to fit in it.Dixie cups do not fitCvs bathroom cups do not fit"
2,Not as advertised,"I ordered this cup dispenser because the one I had on the wall no longer would hold. This dispenser bragged of holding two sizes of cups, 3 oz. and 5 oz. When I received it, it would not hold the 5 oz. cups at all so I returned it. You should have received it by now."
1,Cup's Won't Fit,The 3 oz Dixie type cups will not fit in the unit. I had to shove them in one at a time and some were torn in the process. I ended up throwing out the unit. What a waste.
1,paper cup dispenser,"The dispenser looks great, but it only holds 3 ounce cups which are softer. It is hard to get the cups in and out of the dispenser, making it somewhat worthless to use."
5,"The absolute BEST historical,romantic series I've ever read!","I began with Bond of BLOOD and Knight's Honor and quickly whizzed through the Roslynde Chronicles.It is wonderful to see a strong sexy woman in a position of power in an interesting age.I wonder if anyone picked up that Ranulf of Sleaford and the Lady Catherine were the grandparents of Alinor of Roselynde. I've been haunting the bookstores for another set, hard bound preferably but even paperback as my copies are falling apart. Roberta, keep on writing!!!!"
4,Alinor,"ALINOR ( Roselynde Chronicle, Book Two is a gripping sequel to Roselynde following the life of the chief character . It has adventure, romance, and above all, gives a vivid picture of life in the reign of King John."
4,I enjoyed the writing style of Roberta Gellis!,I enjoyed the writing style of Roberta Gellis. When it comes to historical romance novels it is hard to win me over--so many have tried but most writers fall short in winning me over. I don't exactly know what I am trying to say but I found this writer had what it took to snag me as a fan! I will look for more books by this fun writer!
4,The deadly Dj combination.,"Dj Shadow and Chief Xcel are some of the well known Dj's of the 90's. They have been through many Dj battles and have used their extrem skills to defeat their oponent. The two Dj'S come togeather on one tabel turning, fast scratchin, amazing album. This album could be one of the best Dj albums out. It takes two great Dj's and makes them combin their talents into one great Dj. This album is definitly one of the good Dj albums of the year. It is a must get."
5,Worked great for wiring my sat dish actuator,I used this wire as an easy way to run power to the actuator motor of my satellite dish. Worked great.
