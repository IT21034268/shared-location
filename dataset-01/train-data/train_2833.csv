4,We keep checking it out of the library...,"My 4.5-year-old likes this book a lot, and has asked to check it out of the library over and over again. We like the story of the cat and Miss Perkins growing gradually fonder of each other, until Miss Perkins finally adopts the cat. The illustrations are sweet and the cat's hiding places are cute, and the repetitive language makes it easy for young kids and young readers to follow along or read for themselves.I've give this book five stars, but I have to agree with other reviews that the language is a bit flat. I'm good at reading aloud, but even I have to work hard to breathe life into the dialogue in this book."
5,Impressive Book on Black People,I was impressed by this book and found the professor's writing on black people and their experience interesting. It makes a lot of sense that slavery which was an important part of the black experience becomes internalized in the psyche and exhibits itself in literary expression. I would recommend this book to all who have interest in black experience.
5,An Important Work on Ethnic Studies,This is a very important work on ethnic studies. The groundbreaking element is in the author's use of genre studies -- particularly relating to the study of fantasy and horror literature -- for explaining the experience of the black people in America. This book will give much intellectual stimulation for academics who can build on the research. There is ample stuff for academic laity to appreciate as well.
1,Racist and anti-Semitic,"This book is Christian Dim's latest gem! He focuses on how the Jews are responsible for holding back the progress of African-Americans. Most people will know that this is utter nonsense. It is important to note that this material was written by a man who believes Jews were responsible for 9/11 and a world Jewish conspiracy. Christian's arguments are based on invented or distorted evidence and even then they are very unconvincing. This book should be tossed into the bin where it belongs. I'm a Christian socialist, who believes in tolerance of different races and religions. It is disgraceful that anti-Semitic racists such as Christian Kim are given the 'oxygen' of the press to vent their evil views."
3,Eh...,"No substitute for a good text book, but respectable to say the least. Has accurate accounts of Arizona great history, but a short book dedicated to a subject matter that really deserves VOLUMES!"
3,Pretty Good,"I haven't used the cookie cutters yet, but they were a bit smaller than I had anticipated. If you're going to make tiny cookies, then these are perfect. Also, the shapes aren't as distictive as the picture would have you believe. The edges of the leaves are very rounded and one doesn't even look like a leaf."
2,Leaf cookie cutters,the cutters are awesone - my only complaint is they were smaller that I has expected and not the size that I needed -
2,Cookie Cutters are too SMALL!!!,"The cookie cutters are too small. The cookies are too small and tiny. For some shapes, I could not even get the cookies out without them falling apart."
1,Not what I thought they would be.,"These cookie cutters are not the 3.5"" - 5.0"" size I was anxiously expecting, as the website described them to be - they are miniatures! I can give them as a gift, but I will now have to search another website and make another purchase! I think I was shipped the wrong item, but since I know someone who can use this item I plan to keep them. Please double and triple check your order before hitting the ""proceed with checkout"" button!"
4,"Mostly nice, with some small crevaces","They are small yes, but that is in the description. I found that they're better for things other then cookie dough, or that the dough has to be somewhat stiff since some of the leaves break aparpt easily, but some come out wonderfully."
2,uninformative,I bought this book today and was done with it this evening. It is totally uninformative and absolutely uninteresting. it is nothing more than a psuedo-intellectual trying to to show off all the big words he's learned and be philisophical. Yawn! Do not waste your time. Plus there are no photos!
1,"El Sid, Saint Vicious","The folks at Kirkus are full of it and so isthe jerk that wrote this book. I take no exceptionto anything written; I take execption to the fact that EVERTHING in this book was ripped off of previously published books,(Ie; No Irish,No Blacks,No Dogs, Enland is Dreaming & 12 Days on the Road), strung together with a few outlandish metaphores and similes, then passed off as his own work. It isn't. There is nothing new in this book; no new pictures, no new facts, nada. David Whatever is a fraud just out to make a few $$$. The really insulting part is that he didn't even had the decency to acknowledge the theft with a refence table or a single footnote. Save your money."
1,zero,"Sorry for those who liked it, but I hated it. I've read a lot of books (about Sid or the Pistols) that were much better. This one does SID no good. The writer thinks he talked to Sid like a medium, pitty.... Furthermore there is NO NEWS in this book. Everything is copied from Savage's book and Lydon's book. Again, nothing new...."
1,Terribly,"Terrible book. The author of this book had pages filled of ""Sid's Diary"" which were in fact as he stated in the beginning of the book just a bunch of BS. This book was not even really about Sid and more about how punk got started. I have never been so dissapointed in a book. Don't even waste your two dollars! Trust me this book is not worth it. I'm going to buy another book about him soon, because I learned absolutley nothing frm this one."
4,Neo-Natal Vocabulary,"It's not so much that the words in Word Fugitives are in flight, but rather they are waiting to be created. Ms. Wallraff has captured a moment in a highly fertile time for neologisms. Since publication of this slim volume, many new words have entered our language, but the real value of this book is the author's establishment of a perspective in which to view the birth of a new vocabulary.Having (barely) survived a period in which so many new words were added to our language not from necessity, but from ignorance (e.g. :incentivize"" where motivate has long served us well), it's exciting to think we are at the beginning of an era in which linguistic creativity serves a real need.I recommend Word Fugitives to anyone who revels in the vitality of the English language and the inventiveness of the Anglophones."
1,Nothing New Here,"This book was a total disappointment. The information provided was very basic and contained information most people should already be aware of. I would have returned the book had the price not been so low. I imagine the author simply sat down one afternoon, for an hour, and wrote it when he nothing else to do. I read it in less time and threw it in the trash."
3,It's okay,"This book is really good at explaining the illustrations in SoS. But the author does make some pretty bold and out-dated accusations to feminity, such as getting dressed up to go grocery shopping so your husband doesn't look at other women....that part was really frustrating. But other than that I really enjoyed the thorough explanation verse by verse of what Shulamith was thinking, feeling, and desiring from her husband. Who knew God's Word could be so dirty??"
4,"Nice scent, works well, and the Ms really likes it","Not going to lie: she loves it and I used it to give her a nightly foot massage. The nice thing is that it does not form that rubbery residue on the skin which some water-based lotions have a tendency of doing. The scent is very ""authentic mango,"" which is a great plus. It's not sweet but well-balanced and pleasant. I can't really tell if it moisturizes well but it seems to do the trick as my significant other is happy with it and this is the one product she uses.I can recommend the Mango lotion without reservation. The subscription with amazon.com is really worth it, also."
1,Made in China crap,"These shipped fast and are true to size. Wanted to use for special occasions and holidays. But, rusted really bad after first wash before first use. Made in China crap!"
4,"popular shape for classes, nest nicely","The gradated shapes are exactly what I needed for craft classes. We used them for needle felting shapes for accessories and the sharp side was still ok for flipping over to felt the other side safely. I also plan to use them as templates, drawing, and maybe even cookies. The accompanying tin is perfect for storage (although a clear lid would have been nice to see at a glance what was inside), and they nest nicely, making it easy to identify any missing pieces."
4,Cookie-cutter quality,"What can I say? They're cookie cutters. I wanted them for brownies, though, and although a little tricky to use on brownies, they do work. I'm happpy with them. As cookie cutters, they'd be top notch!"
2,Heart Cookie Cutters missed the mark,"I reviewed the photos that were attached to show what these cookie cutters looked like, and didn't notice until after I purchased them that the photos were different. I wanted the cutters with the frilled edges, and from the first photo, assumed that's what I was getting. I opened the package to find that it was not the set from the first photo, but a set with completely straight edges - I went online and saw I received the set in the second photo. Very disappointed, and haven't used them - trying to decide if I will send them back."
5,Great set,"I didn't get to use them as planned, but they look like a very well made set and come in a cute tin. I think they will be perfect when I make cookies. : )"
3,Doesn't live up to its promise.,"A ridiculously ambitious project, director Moretti here attempts a commentary on life in the New Left by way of a water polo film. Adding to the challenge, the film is also an amnesia comedy. I can't knock him for the effort, but ""Pamobella Rossa"" doesn't pull it all together near as well as I'd hoped it would.Moretti certainly succeeds in mixing pride, anger, and melancholy in his portrait of a personal involvement with Italian Communism. Making it a personal portrait is a smart decision; it prevents the film from becoming overly didactic or just plain boring. Mixing it with water polo is also a smart move I think. But the amnesia angle is just too much. Plausability is thrown totally out the window and the plot quickly begins to irritate. This is not to say that the films is without value. Quite the contrary, there are a number of moments of fine, fine film-making. But on the whole, I can't commend the film beyond the three-, maybe three-and-a-half-, star mark."
2,A very expensive dribble glass,"I bought this mug about three weeks ago, despite the reviews I'd read which mentioned that it leaked. I decided to buy it anyway, because of the size and that every review mentioned how it kept cofee and food hot or cold, as desired. The latter is true: I used it every morning and on my 45 minute commute, the coffee stayed as hot as if I had just poured it. It also did not fit well in my car cup holder, a complaint I had also read in other reviews.The reason I will no longer be using this mug for coffee is because on two different mornings I arrived at work with large brown coffee stains on my white shirt! Embarrassing to go out in public like that, and really inconvenient to return home to change clothes. I would hope that someone at Nissan is reading these reviews and will change the apparent design flaws in this otherwise great mug. I'm only going to be using it for baby food from now on."
4,Replacement Lids,My wife and I have had a pair of the JMF-500 mugs for several years and like many others the sipper lids eventually began dribbling. Last weekend I became fed-up with the dribbling and went online to find a customer service number for Thermos Nissan (1-800-831-0745). I ordered two replacement sipper lids for $8.00 shipped and this weekend I'm sitting here sipping from the new lid with no more dribbling. SWEET!
3,Worked great for six years!,"Unfortunately, I've had it seven. For the past year it's been dribbling into my lap. I wish I could fix it, cause I really liked this mug 'til it started leakin'. It fits the large cupholder in my truck, it's fairly splashproof, and I can even put on the solid lid and carry it in my motorcycle saddlebag. Sip-lid leakage seems to be a common problem, so I'll probably shop for an alternative."
5,Best mug ever,"AARRRGH! I lost my Nissin mug after thirteen years of perfect service. Dents and dings new O-ring and all, it's gone. I wish I had a picture of it to show the abuse that it withstood, and it kept coffee warm for hours. Now I have to get a new one. For those of us that like things to serve their purpose and don't care about fancy flashy lights and gizmos, this is the best mug ever."
3,Spend a coupla bucks more: Get The Ultimate Collection,"As usual with the Millennium Collection, Universal hasn't even attempted to make a career retrospective of artists. Some of Vannelli's best work, like the huge Canadian hits ""Black Cars"" and ""Wild Horses"" were recorded for Arista.The Gino Vannelli Ultimate Collection (search Amazon for ""Ultimate Gino"" & you'll get it) included those tracks and a total of 18 songs, including virtually everything on this quickie CD. Spend 3 bucks more and get the far superior collection.Oooh, you gotta move."
3,there are some Jams here,"Gino Vannelli use to have some cool Jams.especially ""Living Inside MySelf""&""I Just wanna stop"" those were my Jams.when he hit He really hit.He had some cool Arrangements&Vibes."
5,I remember all those nights....,"Smooth and sexy. He's still singing around the world, but there's nothing like his ""Living inside Myself"". I don't know who's hair I loved more, his or Steven Perry of Journey."
4,Great experience,My second purchase..GREAT !!! Timely and as described !!!! I'll do it again !!!! But...If I purchased 2 CD's on the same order.....why should I be charged for single items S&H twice ????
3,I'm in thrall to Lumley,"Volume Two of The Lost Years doesn't maintain the suspense or wonder of Volume One over its 550 or so pages. The trio of vampire families were much more gripping in *getting* to know them, as opposed to the realization of their devious plans which falls somewhat flat. It has its moments, especially in the further history of Radu,incorporating factual dates in history along the way. A chilling cameo by Faethor Ferenczy was a terrific touch of continuity by Mr. Lumley. Infusing an actual Quatrain from Nostradamus into the story was very eerie as well. Obviously if you are on the journey reading all of The Necroscope books, you will not want to skip this. I was genuinely moved at the ending, and was overall satisfied with the book."
4,Now its time for the werewolves tale!,"This is a great read. Lumley once again uses his amazing talent to telling the story of the origin of the werewolf plus so much more. Both of these books are worth every penny and then some, but in my opinion, the trilogy of the vampire world is just a tad better. But this is pulse-pounding reading just the same! Turn out the lights - I dare you!"
3,Tastes good but,"With imaginative ingredients like Stilton cheese and port wine, I expected this Baxters' soup (for which my standards are high) to be something special. Somehow, it missed the boat. And it's among their most expensive. If it runs through my kitchen again, I'll add a bit of pepper."
2,Bathroom Reader,"...I was expecting a comprehensive book about vince, little did I know that it was little more than a bathroom book. It was only a couple of pages long, it was more of a leaflet than a book. If you aren't expecting much from a book, this is the book for you. I could have compiled this same book in a couple of hours."
5,Review for Lobob,"My husband has been using Lobob hard lens cleaner for years and he finds it does a better job than other cleaners he has dried. It's hard to find in stores, so we order online."
2,"Helpful, boring, weird.","I'm 12 and I'm using this book in my summer school. It's okay if you really want to learn how to study, but other than that, it's a waste of money."
4,Great book to review simple mechanical devices in an ever more complicated world,"As a mechanical engineer, it's always good to review the basic mechanical contraptions invented over the millenia. This book has gadgets both familiar and unfamiliar that can be used to improve your mechanical designs. I also use it to teach my children about simple mechanical movements."
4,Nice TV for the money,I've had this TV for quite a while now and haven't had an issue.The only complaint I have is the black frame around the screen hides part of the picture and close captions on the bottom.Otherwise it's a very nice quality unit...
1,Still available,"I ordered this set and waited four months. Amazon sent me an email saying ""Sorry, it's no longer available."" Why is it still advertised?"
3,some colors hard to see,"These balls travel very well, great distance and perfect for someone like me with a slowish swing. The green and blue ones however are very difficult to see. I have lost quite a few balls as they were unspottable. The pink orange and silver are very good though"
3,Useful tool but with critical mistakes,"I used the GPS and the software for 3 weeks. It is very useful when you are planning a journey, estimating driving time. The driving direction is especially important to me. However, during a trip to Washington D.C., it misled us to a very wrong location, which wasted us 3 hours to go back to the correct place. It was really disappointing at that time."
4,Streets Review,"The locator worked very well. The locator icon was right on target when you had the map 3 spots from the lowest setting. The speed reading was very accurate with my car. I took it on a trip, which included Plane, Train and ship. Worked very well in all locations except had a little problem in Washington and Canada on the train. It was hard to get a signal from the train window. Train in Calif. had no problem. Would highly recommend buying this item."
3,It is great when the GPS receiver works...,"I bought this item at the end of last year from Amazon.com. About half a year later, the GPS receiver started to malfunction: all the sudden the GPS receiver would stop working and Windows XP would not be able to find it even if I restarted the computer!! It happened so many times in our trips, and my wife would be quite panic when that happened (can't blame her for it because it happened too often on a high way, when we were moving at 70 miles/hour!)My comment on the product is: it is great when it works; if it doesn't, get your other maps ready. I wonder if I can still get a replacement for the receiver, since it is still less than a year..."
3,GPS works well,"The GPS works well (i.e. it tells you where you are on the map). As far as the routing, there are no voice prompts (helpful when driving alone), there is no distance countdown to the next turn (a great feature on other software), the zoom on the map resets itself when moving to the next turn instruction (zooms way out, quite annoying), the software does not automatically move to the next turn instruction (it really should when using GPS), and the software does not automatically recalculate a route when deviating from the recommended route (you have to push a ""go"" button which can be tough while driving). All in all, this software works better if you plan on traveling with another person to operate the laptop."
2,Address Errors,"Having used ""03 and ""04 Streets and Trips, I was disappointed that this ""USB GPS"" version still used serial port drivers to allow USB operation instead of direct USB.The most disturbing problem, however, is that some how they have screwed up the data base where a large percentage of the addresses I have tried to find are wrong or not on the maps.The search feature accurately found these addresses on previous versions and no support to S&T; '05 is currently provided by Microsoft.Except for a slightly better GPS interface, not much new is offered by the `05 consequently, I would avoid `05 Streets and trips and go with the '04 version."
3,"GPS works, but map data is older than 2003 and 2004 version","The GPS worked great, but the software could be better. One of the nice features is that the software rotates the map for you as you travel. One thing that I did notice is that the map data is old. I did a side by side comparison of streets 2004 and 2005; 2004 had more information. Streets and Trips 2005 description say it has information for 5.4 million miles of routable local, city, state, and highway roads in the United States and Canada; Streets and Trips 2003/2004 has 6.7 million miles of streets and highways. Read booth product descriptions on Amazon. Also some the gas station, restaurants, etc information is out of date."
4,Good product but some improvements are needed,I am very satisfied with this product. However following feature are missing:1. Automatic rerouting2. Turn by turn instruction via voice3. Should calculate and show distance and time to destination.
2,Microsoft Streets & Directions,"I bought this software to aid with navigation in the car (or motorhome) and while I'm pleased with the ability of the USB GPS unit to receive a signal, I'm less than pleased with the functionality of the software. You can get detailed turn by turn directions after entering a begining and an end address - but I can do that for free on the internet. What dissapointed me most was that the GPS functionality is nothing more than placing a blip on a map where you are and telling you how fast you are going (like I needed that). There's no active trip calculation - no ETA to next turn, no indicator where you are on your current list of directions, and heaven forbid if the thing actually told you there's a turn approaching (boy, we're spoiled aren't we?). It's a nice and user friendly interface but the GPS functionality was obviously an afterthought that didn't get much effort."
3,"Good product, but...","Nice product from Microsoft, but it is not intuitive. Icons are not smart at all in identifying the process that they perform when clicked. Map updates are not available, there are just construction updates available. Hope that the PocketPC version of the program have strong search capabilities as the PC version. It doesn't have talk directions, as version 2006, and 2007. Use this product as reference, nothing else."
3,"Not fancy, but it'll get you there...","This is a great product that delivers what it promesses. Lacks features like 3D views or voice prompts (seen in other Microsoft products)but it works really nice. The GPS locator works well too. If you just want directions without the blows and whistles, this is the product to get."
5,MS Streets & Trips 2005,"Great product for multiple trips, easy to use. Great export feature for a PDA. PDA maps easy to use."
3,There is no GPS to calculated route software connection,"Software doesn't translate position from GPS to the position in the calculated route. So, there is no coming turns notifications, current miles/estimated time to destination or automatic route recalculations. Also, sometimes you have to restart application after system standby because it stops recognizing GPS receiver."
4,"Would have got 5 stars, But!!!","I bought this so i wouldn't have to go online all the time to get directions. It has proven to be extremely accurate in this mode.However with the GPS antenna attached to my laptop, and this attached to a mounting i knocked together for the mini-van, the wife and i were off and running.I am used to using GPS devices from my time in the Army, but the wife was thrilled, no more having to use a map, and no more having to back track after missing a turn!!The system has proved to be very robust, especially now i have upgraded to window 2000.My kids love using the system when we go out, however, and this is why it only got 4 stars from me, why oh why didn't MS put in a voice prompt??As other reviewers have said, i suspect that they will add this feature to their 2006 issue, however i think it would be nice if they offered an online patch with this option, come on microsoft?A great product spoilt by not fully taking advantage of the GPS capability."
2,Very dissatisfied with Opteka Telephoto for Kodak Z740 camera,"I purchased the Opteka 3.2 x AF Telephoto lens for my Kodak Z740 camera and I should have saved the money. No matter how I played with the autofocus on the camera with the Opteka lens in place the final photographs even using a tripod were too blurry to be satisfactory. What good is a telephoto lens if the end result is is an fuzzy photo? After being frustrated with the results, I went on line only to discover that I was not alone in having problems with this lens with the Kodak Z740 camera. Save the money and accept the telephoto lens that is an integral part of the Z740 camera."
2,Another useless lens,I bought this lens for my Kodak Z650 as well. And it's just as useless as the 10X MACRO lens. I can't get anything to focus with this lense installed. But can with the 2.2 HD2 Telephoto??? Again I've written the company and am hoping they know of tip that will make this work. This lens was the primary lens that I wanted!UPDATE: After calling 47stphoto I was advised that I could return or exchange it but that I might want to try using the lens at a longer distance to subject. I went home and tried exactly that and it does focus and lock in. BUT only about 50-60% of the time because I'm not real sure yet how far away from teh subject item I have to be. I'm on the fence with this item now and am still thinking of returning it and then purchase the real KODAK Telephoto lens. It has to work better....
5,Beautiful,Product was purchased as a gift. The item arrived in great condition and packed well. I have one of my own and it work great. The lid is so much easier than the old method of tieing paper around the top to cover and no more need of worry of water or steam seeping into the pudding.
1,Rusted after one use,"It worked great, but after one use I found it had rust marks all over, couldn't use again. Returned unhappy with product"
4,Pot for Plum Pudding,"I had been looking for a pot to make Plum Pudding. While I was on Amazon, I saw the pot & ordered it. When I received this item, it was great. Well I made the Plum Pudding & it came out great. I can not wait until I can order another one. Next time I make this, I will make it sooner then I did this past year. This pot works great for making Plum Pudding."
4,Never thought I'd find one!,"Christmas is coming and I was desperately looking for a pudding mold to make ""Rolly Polly"" for my family and friends. This is the perfect size and works wonderfully. I'd recommend it for those of you who still make homemade puddings."
4,Christmas pudding pan,"My son and I decided to make a traditional English Christmas pudding for Christmas. This pan made it very easy. One tidbit of info I will give, put a piece of parchment paper over the top of pan and then put on lid. This helps so no steam will escape. Our pudding turned out great."
2,Penn-Plax 5 Step Ladder - Assorted Colros - Small Bird,"The picture featured online shows a cockatiel on the ladder, which leads me to believe that it was made for a larger bird other than a parakeet. I called and discussed this with a telephone rep. and they sent me a larger ladder and a label to send the smaller ladder back. The rep. was awesome! He could not have been more friendlier or helpful!!"
3,More B-sides To Satisfy Your R.A. Addiction,"The second single from Ryan Adams and the Cardinals May 2005 release Cold Roses show cases 2 B-sides that have been featured in the Secret Garden area of the bands recent website. ""Tonight"" (track 2), which has also been refered to as ""Impossbile Dream"" on some fan web sites, is a recent live favorite. It's Cookie Monster voiced lyrics are clever (You're love is an impossible dream, these cocktails give me ESP) and build to a soaring chorus and Ryan's trade mark croon. The song could be a single, but doesn't fit into either the thematic or melodic structure of Cold Roses. Track 3, ""Learn to Love"", is a mellow alt-country out take that just isn't as strong as the body of Cold Roses. ""Learn to Love"" is a fan only track. However, ""Tonight"" is worth dropping your hard earned cash on in itself."
4,odd choice,"I don't think this was the best choice for the second single from Cold Roses, but it features two fine b-sides (Learn to Love is especially great, a long and rambling profession of uneasy love) that are unlikely to see inclusion on either of the albums coming out later this year."
2,Danco Brushed nickel Swivel Aerator,"Got this for my goose neck brushed nickel faucet....it matches BUT....to fit on the faucet the threads show on the outside connection, thus it looks like its missing something and unfinished. So sad about that as I had to settle for a chrome one. ITs a little smaller so the difference in the finish isnt as obvious as having the threads show on this one."
3,Needs Updating,"The BRS Series is great for its comprehensive outline-type review. BRS psych is good, but is in desparate need of updating. At this point, I wouldn't recommend ANYone buy it because some of the information is actually now incorrect. The pharmacology section is hopelessly out-of-date."
2,Out of date,"This book was very helpful for my psychiatry clerkship in my 3rd year of medical school (5 years ago). I picked it up for the first time in several years today (as a PGY-3 psychiatry resident), and see that the information is very outdated. The information presented on bipolar depression, for example, would now be considered incorrect. I recommend no one use this edition of the book."
4,I would recommend,"Excellent saw for the money. I don't have any issues with the quick chain adjuster, as long as you tighten the nuts properly. Kinda difficult to start right out of the box, I was about to decide that it wasn't gonna start, but it did finally did and started every time there after. Good saw for the money.However you can buy the saw at Lowe's for about 50 bucks less."
4,"CHAIN SAW GAS 20 "" 48CC",Well writen instructions for assemably of saw chain and operation of saw. it ran great and cut through large trees and limbs like butter. this chain saw is well worth the money!
2,Music for elevator,"Jimmy Webb never shunned commercial success. He knew how to butter his bread, writing enthusiastically for Madison Avenue. He might have written for Broadway, as well--many of the songs on this album would've made good showtunes.The first cut is ""Up, Up And Away""--jaunty fluff well-suited for an elevator, as the title suggests. It's creditably sung by Southern, who is at her best where Webb is at his worst. She delivers smooth, upbeat renditions of ""Which Way To Nowhere"", ""Carpet Man"", ""Everybody Goes To The Moon"" and ""Magic Garden"". But her monotonously insouciant style undercuts the poignancy of ""By The Time I Get To Phoenix"", ""Honey"", ""Wichita Lineman"", and ""The Worst That Could Happen"", resulting in simpering bathos. The finale, ""Didn't We"", is nicely done, however, and somewhat redeeming.All in all, this is not the worst that could happen to Webb's music, but I certainly wouldn't rush out and buy this album."
1,He did; she didn't.,"With due respect to Ms. Southern, the fire sale price tells the tale: In the firmament of Webb covers, this album was a lesser light, and in the wake of ""Ten Easy Pieces"" it's now beside the point. Want Webb? Get it from the horses mouth.James Fanuzzi"
1,terrible beyond comprehension,sheila's singing style and the arrangements are straight out ta welk show. schmaltz with no redeeming quality...webb's 10 easy pieces or the reissued glen campbell 'reunion' cds show how it's 'sposed to be done....
2,brody plays both sides,and it shows. Awful traipse through boredom up to a dull non-ending. Good camera work though. I watched it waiting for a twist; Giallo was Inspector's long lost brother - anything - even the ridiculous would have been more than was offered. Giallo (the villain) was painfully brody; and what was the sense in him playing a dual role with no connection to the story; couldn't they afford to hire someone else? Two stars only because I hate to admit I watched the full version of a one-star movie.
2,Wow! Someone gave this a good review?,"I love Italian ""giallo"" films and when Argento was returning to the genre with GIALLO, I thought it would be great. I thought wrong!!! Boring boring boring!!!! Adrian Brody should NOT have been in this film. He ruins it!!! Well, Argento ruined it too!!! He's lost his touch. ""Mother of Tears"" was not good either. Maybe it's time for him to retire. Check out some of his better works: The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Tenebre, Suspiria, Four Flies on Grey Velvet, Cat O'Nine Tails, Nonhosonno (aka Sleepless), and Deep Red."
2,I wonder if Mr. Brody finally got paid for double time?,"Dario Argento movies have always been a mixed bag, but he is genuinely tiresome with GIALLO. The blatantly obvious connection between cop and killer is the essential element of this particular exercise in Italian pulp; sadly, it is handled so sloppily that everyone involved has good reason to be embarrassed. The bad press only hints at the ineptness."
3,Mat is slippery,"I received this kit as a Christmas present. I already know a little yoga, so instead of popping in the DVD, I decided to do one of my old routines. I found the mat to be extremely slippery and very disappointing - slid right out of downward dog! Still haven't tried the DVD, so can't comment on that."
4,Good starter kit,When I was starting out / trying yoga I bought this set two years ago. It is a durable and easy to use set. It is inexpensive and worth the buy to try.
3,Actually a Gaiam product,"This kit is not made by SPRI. If I'd wanted a mat with ""GAIAM"" printed on it in big letters, I could have picked one up at the grocery store (or gotten the Gaiam kit here on Amazon for ten dollars cheaper, and at least has a Rodney Yee dvd included). Everything seems like OK quality, but I'm not pleased with the logos printed on everything... it's actually stamped into the blocks. They are not plain, as shown in the pictures. Meh."
3,Didn't like the Q&A,"I read part of this around the time I was into Joanna and didn't know much about her. Upon reading it I was frustrated by the Q&A; style so much, I didn't read it like a book, but instead just flicking through pages and whatever caught my eye. The interviewer was really annoying and intruding, I did not like that. Especially when the interviwer asked some questions that were personal, like how many men she has had.I did enjoy what I read, especially the ghost story. Having it set in her house was really interesting and intimate. I just wish it wasn't set up like it was and I might've really enjoyed it.I would never try to read this again like a book, it's just too annoying, but rather like the way I had done by flicking through. Joanna's audio book of this is so much better from the few minutes I've heard of it. She doesn't include the questions from the interviewer, but just says her story."
4,Thermo Sensor,Depend on this every day to supplement local weather reports--not always available in stores. When we moved we took it with us to new home
1,save your money.....unless you want to invest in the Post Ofc.,I put together of pie maker gift package for a friend including this product. I had order all through Amazon and was so disappointed that the shipping charges cost more than the items themselves. I say if you can't find it locally (Target or whatever) then skip it.... cause it/they are not worth double the Amazon price...and this is not that special of an item. Save your money and bad feelings.
2,Ateco Pastry Cloth,This was a grave disappointment and I felt like digging a grave and burying the cloth and cover. The pastry cloth is too stiff (something like a stiff in a grave) and the rolling pin cover is way to long and doesn't fit the rolling pin. What's the problem here? Aren't rolling pins pretty standard in size? I would not recommend this product to anyone.
5,Works as advertised,"After buying (and returning) more expensive items such as a nonstick rolling pin, we purchased the pastry cloth and rolling pin cover. We are most pleased at how well they work in rolling out pastry to make a pie."
4,Ateco Pastry Cloth,"The Ateco Pastry cloth is a perfect gift for the Baker in your life. A simple and inexpensive tool to make the rolling of pastry dough easy and fast.The included roller cover is a little on the small side if you use a large roller, but will Stretch if you are determined."
5,"Great, Inexpensive Set that works as well as Grandma's does.","It's not always convenient to borrow my Great-Grandmother's heavy flannel pastry cloth and rolling pin cover, so I bought this inexpensive set for myself. The cloth is a thick, stiff canvas that holds the flour and releases the dough nicely. The knit rolling-pin cover is long and stretchy enough to easily cover any of my large rolling pins. I used this set to roll out and cut an entire batch of refrigerated sugar cookie dough and even the warmer, re-rolled dough did not stick. The pastry cloth did scoot around on my table cloth more than I'm used to, but overall I was very impressed with this set. I was surprised and thrilled that it worked just as well as my Great-Grandmother's. I bought a second set for my Mom."
5,I LOVE MY PASTRY CLOTH AND ROLLING PIN COVER,"MY HUSBAND FOUND THE PASTRY CLOTH FOR ME.MY MOTHER USED A pASTRY CLOTH FOR ALL THE YEARS I WAS GROWING UP AND SEEMS LIKE SHE WAS FOREVER BAKING SOME TYE OF 'GOODIE' I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN MY HUSBAND FOUND THIS ONE AND HAVE BEEN ON A ""COOKIE MARATHON"" THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO FOR YEARS,SO THANK YOU FOR HAVING JUST WHAT I NEEDED AND IT MAKES BAKING ANYTHING MUCH EASIER TO ROLL...BE IT COOKIE DOUGH OR PIE CRUST. ELAINE HAWKINS"
5,Great Little Car,My newphew absolutely loves this car! He likes to make us stand and pretend we are tunnels so he can send the car through our legs and then we have to send the car back through his. It's a great little car and goes a lot further then I thought it would.
1,Don't Bother,"You can shake these cars till your arm falls off and they still only go a few feet. I got these for my boys ( 3 and 4 ) for Christmas and we were all disappointed in how short a distance they go no matter how much you shake them. Also within a couple of months they stopped going at all, they would still make the engine noise but would not move. I thought is might be just the ones i got so i got a couple more but they did the same thing."
3,Battery drain,"My son gets aggravated when playing with his Shake n Go cars. They lose strength quite quickly. At first they are quick, but after a few uses they do not go very far. The batteries do not last very long and they require 3 AA batteries."
3,OUTRAGIOUS!!!!,I Can't believe they're charging this much for these shake and go cars. They're around $11 everywhere else!!!Crazy!!!
1,Not Happy!,I already had this info for free. I thought there would be something more ..... Not even worth $1.00. I will probably never get another e doc article.
5,well written look at our impact on ecosystems,Stein is an excellent science writer who makes the major concepts of ecology come alive in this work. She uses her personal story as a homeowner to illustrate how the suburbs have devastated our natural ecosystems and what we can do to help restore some sort of natural balance with the native wildlife in our area.
5,"Absolutely the best ""how-to"" greeting card book out there!","If you're going to get only one, this is it! I spent 20 at Hallmark in the Creative Writing and Editing departments, so I feel I know whereof I speak. The book is very user-friendly; the writing is fun, friendly and concise. While it covers all types of greeting card writing, it gives a special emphasis in the new humor and alternative styles of writing. And for those of you who want to start your own button or bumpersticker or t-shirt company in your garage, there is an excellent section on this type of writing, we call ""Self-Expression."" With the hundreds of Electronic Greetings sites now out there, the opportunity for personal creativity is greater than ever. Armed with this book, you'll become a true professional."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I was quite disappointed with this book in that it was extremely limited in its topics. It was very thorough in its explanation of different writing styles and formats, but it barely discussed the marketing side of it...payment standards, format for submissions. I would have liked this section to be more than just a few pages(out of almost 200), and also for them to have included a little bit on basic overall card design (many of us do both the writing and illustrating).This book is not an end-all resource on breaking into the greeting card industry, but it is a good place to go if having trouble coming up with ideas."
4,Nice for drinking hot drinks at home.,"I like this insulated mug because of its black rubber grips along its middle (easy to grip in your hand) and along its base (easy to set down steadily). I don't use the screw-on top because as people have said you're likely to get a drop of drink floating around the lid from the small drink hole/latch system. As with all insulated mugs, it's recommended that you don't put it in the dishwasher. I just rinse mine out in the sink, let it dry upside down, and it's ready for tea again. Keeps tea and cocoa good and hot."
3,it leaks,"This works fine to keep drinks warm for extended periods of time, but in my opinion a travel cup should not leak, and this one spills copious amounts of liquid as soon as it is not in an upright position. A much better design is the oxo (also available from Amazon), which I had but lost it."
1,Doesn't leak? Whatever!,"I bought this mug because it got such great reviews for its non-leakiness. Well, either I got a defective product or Thermos is planting these reviews, because you can pour coffee out of it when the lid is closed. Returned this sucker after one day."
3,It's OK,"I was expecting more for the money I paid. First of all, hot liquids don't stay hot nearly the amount of time they're supposed to. Then, if you angle it, it will spill all over. I was hoping to put it in my bag and forget about it, but it's impossible, you have to carry it around, and hold it or put it on some horizontal surface. Then the rubber in the middle started wearing off after 2 weeks, and so did the tag that says Thermos Nissan. It's annoying..."
4,Great Insulation,"This thermos nissan tumbler has fantastic insulation, and can keep my coffee very hot for up to 3 hours as advertised. My only problem with it is the lid, as it is certainly not leak-proof. even tipping it slightly on it side will cause some leakage. other than that, its great."
3,"Good, but...","Overall, this is a passable insulated coffee-mug. True that the lid latch isn't spill proof (more like ""slosh-proof""), and it sometimes leaves a drop on your nose if you're not paying attention. My biggest complaint about this travel mug is that there's a rubber seal inside that's impossible to clean: Unscrew the lid, and look down inside the mug. Just underneath the black plastic rim there's a thick translucent-white rubber seal. After using this mug for several weeks, I discovered that some of my coffee (with cream & sugar please) gets trapped up underneath this seal and the funky cheese starts to grow. Nissan replaced my mug under warranty, and sure 'nuff, the new one did this too. It's pretty gross. Now I use a cheap plastic travel mug without any seals inside -- it's a whole lot easier to clean!"
4,Keeps It Hot,"Excellent beverage carrier and it does not leak. Also, the flip top says up when you're drinking. When pre-warmed, it will keep coffee hot for approx. 4 hours. Only surprise was a small air vent in the rubber base. If you immerse the bottom in water to wash it, the base fills up with water and you'll wonder ""where the leak is""."
2,Spills,"I do like this mug, but the flip piece does not seal even slightly, it will spill, althought the high sides on the lid does keep the spilled liquid slightly contained & the liquid does not keep hot as long as the Starbucks stainless steal mug."
5,works very well,"I bought this thermos for my husband, and he loves it. It fits into the car's cup holder, holds a lot of coffee, keeps it hot for quite a while, and seems pretty indestructible. My husband once put it on the roof of the car while doing something else and then drove off. He realized what he'd done and went back to rescue it from the street--and it was in fine condition, with the coffee mostly still inside."
5,ordering another one,"I've had this mug for several years and it's by far the best travel mug i've had. It's narrow enough to fit in my wife's terrible cupholders on her VW, and heavy enough to not tip easily. It absolutely has never spilled a drop in the many years I have been carrying it. I'm getting a spare because my wife is jealous. :)"
1,Confirmation of previous reviews,"This Thermos Nissan 14 Ounce Stainless-Steel Insulated Travel Tumbler was as previous reviews have noted a spiller/slosher.Whether setting down into car holder, drinking from, hitting an unexpected pot hold or many of the daily activities this cup is sold for you will need one item: a cloth to wipe the spills on yourself and the car.This is a slosher.Builder0524"
1,Fails the most basic test: It leaks.,"With the lid in the closed position, this travel mug will still leak if tipped or inverted. In my mind, this is an abject FAIL for any mobile beverage container. Even a plastic soda bottle does not leak when closed. Yes, it's pretty. Yes, it keeps your coffee hot. Yes, it'll fit in your cupholder. Still: 1 star"
5,"Great mug, keeps warm for hours","I have gone through quite a few ""travel mugs"" in the past few years and this is by far the best one yet. It keeps my drinks warm for hours. Not only that, but it is very easy to clean, doesn't seem to pick up smells the way plastic does and is extremely sturdy."
3,"It is o.k., not great","If you preheat the tumbler with hot water, then it keeps the liquid pretty hot for a good amount of time, but that is a hassle unless you have a hot water boiler standing by. The top is certainly troublesome since the liquid splashes out when you try to drink it when it is not very full. There is also no way to prevent spills unlike some other design"
5,Durable & Keeps Coffee Hot,"I travel frequently, and wanted a thermal travel tumbler that would keep my coffee hot, allowing me to enjoy it for an extended period of time. I have owned two 14-Ounce Nissan travel tumblers identical to this one since 1997, and my wife and I have used them almost daily for the past 15-years. None of the other thermal travel tumblers I've been given, or have tried, came close to comparing with the Nissan tumblers for quality and long lasting thermal capability. I lost one on a road trip this week, so I immediately ordered a replacement from Amazon. I added the 18-Ounce version to my order, as well. I was pleasantly surprised and relieved to see these travel tumblers are still being sold."
5,Repeat Buyer!,This is my third 14-ounce Nissan Thermos. It is the only thermos that keeps my coffee drinkable into the late afternoon.
2,Why is it so hard to find a good mug?,"First of all, let me quickly dispel the notion that this mug is spillproof. It will indeed contain coffee from splashing out when things get bumpy. But if it gets turned over onto its side or upside down, coffee will quickly pour out. Second, there's an annoying depression on the cap that allows liquid to pool in it so that when you take a drink, it inevitably drips onto your nose. That could have been easily fixed. Sometimes I wonder if anyone actually tests these things out before selling them."
2,hard to clean/starts to smell badly if you use it for milk based drinks.,"If you only use this thermos for tea it might work well but if you use it for milk based drinks like lattes, don't buy it. The milk gets caught in the seal and it's so hard to clean and then like other reviewers have mentioned it starts to smell and washing doesn't help. I wish the manufacturers had designed it so that the seal part would atleast be removable so that you can wash it."
2,Not close to leak proof,"Yes keeps coffee hot...if you can keep coffee in it. Tipping it even slightly causes the coffee to leak out, and not at a drip-by-drip pace but at a faucet-one-quarter-turned-on flow. Not what I was expecting. Tried Contigo which leaked after 5 months, then Oxo which also leaked, now Nissan, will have to find another."
3,"""I expected more!""","I guess my expectations were greater than the reality. It's a nice travel mug. I don't think it's worth the price being charged. I got warm coffee at about 2 hours (That is a long way from the 3 to 5 I have seen in various claims.) As long as you don't expect too much you'll probably be satisfied but I'm not. Yes, my lid leaks as well."
2,insulating but LAME,"The first morning I drank out of my cup, I bragged on it to my wife. She said ""yeah, I was looking at it and it doesn't look very spill proof."" I thought ""of course it's spill proof, this cup got great reviews and how hard is it to make a cup spill proof? I mean, really!"" So....I turned it over and got a lap full of coffee. Since then, it's been knocked over in the car when only about a quarter full....again spillage....I love the looks of this cup-it does an excellent job keeping my coffee warm but.....the closure is more of a suggestion than actually having any sort of closing/sealing function. I had a starbucks mug like this a while back and it was by no means perfect, but it didn't spill when turned upside down."
1,Complete IDIOT'S guide for REAL IDIOTS,"This is a Real Idiot's Guide for idiot's.This is a very confused book confused author,can make heads or tails of what he wants to convey it seems to me that he's making fun of Buddhism.I do not like this book at all.I have been studying Buddhism for more than 20yrs and I bought the book for my grandaughter to start reading,What a mistake and so glad that I looked at it first she would be very confused by now."
4,Works well on RV toilet,"What can you say about this? It holds water, and allows it to overflow back into toilet. Size is approximately 14 3/4 X 14 1/4 inch oval at rim, with a bowl of 10 3/4 X 9 1/2 inches, and 4 1/2 inches deep. Fits in a standard Thetford RV commode."
4,stiz review,The sitz bath is a perfect tool for the job it was created to do. I would recommend it to anyone with my health condition.
5,a sweet slice of americana to warm you to your toes,"After a stressful day at work, this is a book to curl up with on the sofa. It warms you like a cup of tea and a cozy quilt; little snipets of neighbors and friends and their every day but important events that may change how you view those around you. A real treat! I enjoyed every word."
3,Life in a small town,I picked up this book because I liked other books by this author. The stories were short so it was a quick read. I found the life experiences of each person to be interesting and found that we are all alike in so many ways. Would recommend if you want something quick to read while you wait.
4,Almost Perfect,"The star of this amazing show is Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds. I loved this video very much, the only problem is, it gets bogged down a little in the middle. Guest stars include Eric Clapton, Stevie Wonder, K-Ci & JoJo and Mr.Edmonds two brothers, Melvin & Kevon. Babyface joins both Stevie & Eric for two songs apiece. On the version of ""Change The World"", I was really suprised to see how good a guitar player Mr. Edmonds is. On the two songs performed with Stevie Wonder, It's pure R&B. It's just the middle three or so songs that drag the performance down, to make this an almost perfect video."
5,Babyface has always been one of my fave's @}->---,"I still love Babyface. I have all of his cd's and I still listen to them all.I don't normally like watching live performances on dvd (I'd rather be at the performance persoally), but this is great. Almost all of my favourites are here and he does some great duets. Breathe Again was performed with Shanice (who does a great job), Change The World with Eric Clapton and I Care About You (that was done by Milestone in Soul Food). Also here is Whip Appeal which is one of my all time favourite songs from him from Tender Lover cd.This dvd is probably as close as I'll ever come to seeing this master in concert. I really enjoyed this and even though I've had it for years, I still watch it a couple of times a year and enjoy it each time as if it were the first time around."
5,"Challenges the status quo, inspiring and definitely a winner","Women For Hire job held a job fair in Dallas, TX which I attended and provided free copies of CEO Tory Johnson's latest book to all participants in the breakfast seminar.I would recommend ""Women For Hire's Get-Ahead Guide to Career Success"" to any career woman looking to succeed in today's competitive job market. The book is a winner in changing one's mindset critical to any major change in life and serves beyond just the table of valuable content and advise but is also a valuable reference guide in the many phases of a woman's career path.Above all the book empowers women to to strive to succeed and find joy in their work and still maintain work-life balance. In short it encourages one to evaluate one's current situation and challenge the status quo and map your vision for career success.A very genuine and sincere effort by Tory Johnson,Robyn Freedman Spizman and the countless women interviewed in the book."
4,Two good books in a single pack!,"In my opinion its a great deal to be able to get the first two books of the inheritance cycle by the price of one. In my opinion both books are very good, especially considering it came from a very young mind. I like how the first book starts the story with good detail and how the second one continues it with greater complexity in the plot that draws readers in. Recommend these books to anyone especially this two-in-one book."
4,It's no Harry Potter but it is a fun read...,"Just like some popular adult fiction titles, this book isn't perfect but is simply enjoyable to read. As an adult who reads most books via audio book during my daily commute, I thoroughly enjoyed Eragon and look forward to Eldest. I bought the book for my 11 yr old nephew to read, thinking it is a wonderfully fun story for KIDS... people get too caught up in the hype... there are certainly many more well written books out there but this was simply fun to read, which is well worth the money in my opinion. And if it gets a kid away from the Play Station, KUDOS!"
5,Don't be fooled . . .,". . . by the entertaining, though perhaps lite & juvenile nature of the film ""Eragon"". Don't be fooled by the classification of this series for ""young readers"". Don't be fooled by the youth of the author or the comparisons of his works to ""Harry Potter"". There is depth here.Paolini has absorbed a comprehensive library of fantasy lore, mixed in his own perspective, and managed to generate characters that are unique and mature beyond his own years.Those characters have taken control of his story and as you delve deeper into the Inheritance Cylce, you can't help but wonder where they might take the author and ourselves. This is one of those rare stories in which the journey is as enjoyable as the destination - one you may even wish to read again.Enjoy."
1,Rip off of JRR Tolkien,"Tons of hype, NYT best seller and a movie; boy did I expect more! Its nothing more than a rip off of Lord of the Rings, without the cute little hobbits. Dwarves live underground, make elaborate cities in mountains, bond with stone. Graceful Elves have pointy ears, live a long time, are aloof and above mere mortals. Protagonist is a young male-on-a-mission. Long trek with protagonist at center, elf and dwarf in-tow ensues. Sound familiar? It should. Its a re-invention of the characters and even sub plots of the LofR trilogy, only not nearly as well written or clever. Tired, familiar, and predictable, I'd like a refund. Time better spent rereading the original Tolkien. Pass on this."
4,"Great read, looking forward to #3, but...","It a great read, but it's not from the mind of a 16 year old. It's the dad, there is a little pompous prose that comes on a regular basis that 16 year old can't produce. Also, the dragon from day one talks like a father with a master's degree. SO, just overlook the genius dragon with the wit of a poet and the highbrow prose, and what is left is the general storyline of the sixteen year old, and that is good. (You want proof, the boy said he dad was the editor!) Dear Daddy editor, if you read this, stop stroking it! Again, I look forward to #3"
1,The fix is in,Clearly there's a few fans who think it is funny to drown out the reviews from real people who paid good money then were extremely disappointed. It is not funny in any way to say these are great books so people get ripped off. In no way shape or form are these good books. I've never been so bored reading in my life.
2,"THe first was good, but...","The first book was good, but I just could not get into the second book. It took a hundred pages to get no where... A wast of my money..."
1,Don't believe the hype,"I read both books in this series, expecting them to improve based on the glowing reviews of Eragon. However, the stories have paper thin plots and card board cut out characters. This is a paint by numbers story and possibly the worst I've ever read in my life. I don't usually write unfavorable reviews, but if I can encourage one person to save themselves from this, then it was worth it. Shame on you Knopf!"
2,I - BE - GONE,"My 14-year old niece didn't care for this book and I should have listened to her before buying it. I'm halfway through the first book and have already lost interest. This is just my opinion and I don't mean to be harsh, but I feel that if I were to take transcripts of ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" and shuffle them both together, I'd get ""Eragon"". I do believe that with proper schooling, this young author will have a bright career and I hope he'll consider a re-write of this novel. I'm sure that I would have enjoyed this attempt more if the characters spoke in traditional old-english OR new-modern dialect, as I found that blending the speaking styles was distracting. I also would have preferred less repetitive conversation and more action. The first 2 chapters were good, but after that became tedious. So, I think that the book is too wordy for kids under the age of 13 and not sophisticated enough for those who are older. Sorry."
3,LOTR wanna' be,"I liked the books. It is interesting how similar the concept is to LOTR. He created different languages, elves, dwarves... It has been done before, yet it is still fun to read. And to think this book was written by a teenager? That in itself is an accomplishment!Way to go home schoolers!!"
4,Quality of the books.,I received my books quickly and they were as perfect as if I had bought them in the store.
3,Young Paolini,It is interesting to watch the young author improve his abilities through the first two texts. He has a wonderful career ahead.
4,A Value Purchase of a Fantastic Fantasy Series,"This is an excellent way to purchase the initial two books in the ongoing Inheritance series by Christopher Paolini.My only quibble is the boxed set has no additional features to entice a reader who has previously purchased the books separately. Though it seemingly eliminates one market of readers/collectors, the avenue is open for those wishing to explore the books at a nice price."
4,Awsome!!!,This book were very good I just wished that the begining of the movie was close to the books beginning. other then thet it was awsome!!!
5,Eragon,The was a wonderful story. I never imagined being so involved in the storyline. This is a must read!!!!
2,A decent start with no heart,"Technically speaking, Eragon was an excellent book but I could only go roughly one hundred pages in before I gave up. Characters died and I couldn't care less. Paolini wrote with his head, not with his heart. As cheesy as that might sound, that's how I felt.The ideas were not wholly original, and I was reminded of Tolkien, McCaffrey and a mess of other authors and it detracted from the book as a whole. The characters weren't believable and while it was easy to see exactly what was happening (with the images, anyway) it was far too predictable.Good for children, but a more mature audience might be daunted."
4,Better than the movie...,These two books really show off the author's talent a a writer. I was glued to the pages until I finished and then wanted more.
3,Not too shabby,"For the price, the book set isn't bad. I've finished Eragon and am working on Eldest, and I've found the books to be entertaining (certainly much better than the movie). Still, they aren't on quite the same level of fantasy writing as some of the more popular authors. Despite this, the books are very understandable and easy to read for younger readers."
5,loved it,Been wanting to read. This series for a long time. Finally broke down and it was so worth it. I would highly recomend thi recomend this series its fun original amd full of action.
5,Awesome 5*,"Very nice book set. I loved how it came within 2 days, and now, I am currently reading the first. Great value and great quality book."
5,My husband loved the books!!!,"I purchased the books for my husband's birthday, and he can't put them down. I got the books so fast, I let him open them early. They were in great condition."
3,Trilogies!,"This is a great set of books, but why not finish a book and then publish it? Trilogies are my worst nightmare! I want to sit and read and FINISH a good book - is that too much to ask? Let me know when the third one is finished and I will buy it then.And now WHERE is the 4th book with the REAL ending??? Enough said."
1,"Originally self-published, and it shows.","An avid reader, I've read 80 books already this year. I've been a fantasy reader for 40 years, and I've read almost every fantasy book ever written. I can't believe I was suckered into buying this by the glowing reviews. Originally this was self-published, and there's a reason for it. ""Eragon"" is the worst book ever written, even if you count ""Eldest"" which brings fantasy to a new low. This book is filled with awkword phrases, bad dialogue, and muddled plots. Avoid this series; avoid this author. Paolini got the last dime he'll ever get from me."
5,Eragon Rocks!,I bought the Eragon set for my son's birthday and he has just eaten it up. He is reading it everyday and has started writing his own stories becuase he was so inspired that a kid wrote it. It is a great story--more detailed than the movie. Great read for kids 11-18 also adults-
4,Insightful,"I can't say this is a hilarious collection because much of the material is from Pryor's early days and therefore not very funny. (He bombs on CD1 - no one in the audience is laughing! I wasn't either.)However things get really funny on Disc 2 (material from ""Craps"") where he expands his routine and becomes comfortable enough with his own stage persona to experiment and create his own method (instead of being what the back cover describes as a ""Cosby imitator).Overall this is an essential collection for any Pryor enthusiast, however if you're new to Pryor's material I recommend purchasing his later albums which are funnier and will likely entertain you more. For collectors, however, this is great stuff."
5,The Amazing Richard Pryor,"EVEN when he was alive, THERE was NO competetion . . .This man was so far ahead of most people --- and certainlymost comics . . .As far as I'm concerned, as long as thereis sound recording, Richard Pryor will never be dead."
4,Interesting version of I Need You,"The track listing notes Leean Rimes' ""I Need You"" as being a radio edit, but it's more than that. It's also a remix, making it more of a country song from the original. A pedal steel guitar is brought in as well as a banjo and acoustic guitar, and the background vocals are different as well. Leean's vocals are the same as is some of the instrumentation. Makes for an interesting comparison to the first release. Also nice seeing the song treated as an inspirational song, the way it was meant to be."
3,He had so many more hits than this,"Do not get me wrong the music that actually made it on to this cd is really good and that is not the problem. But like another reviewer said how can a George Strait collection like this be missing one of his best songs ever Amarillo by Morning! I think most George Strait fans have these songs already I have these on Strait out of the box, the original albums, and on greatest hit packages. 20th Century Masters sure left out alot of good songs like Ocean Front Property and so many more and what about after 1993 it seems on this collection that's the year George Strait stopped singing because nothing later than 1993 is on this cd. If own everything by George you do not need this because you just wasting your money."
5,The Best of the Old Strait,"I actually heard this album for the first time when it was featured on a long flight and I bought it as soon as I landed. Like other CDs in the Millenium Collection, this is essentially a sampling of George Strait's body of work through about the mid-1990s. As a result, it contains many of the songs that made him country music's biggest name (if you follow country music, that is) such as Ace in the Hole, Love Without End Amen, and All My Exes Live in Texas.This is basically country music in as raw a form as you can get it - if you range towards the Shania Twain/Tim McGraw end of the country music spectrum there's a good chance you may not like this CD. If you are someone who is a total Strait addict and you own every major recording he's ever done, this CD will be a disappointment. But if you really like his new stuff (which was compiles in Latest Greatest Straitest Hits) and you want to get a feel for why he became famous, this is the CD for you."
2,You gotta be kidding me with this!,"Last tuesday when I saw this in the paper I thought not another 20th century masters low budget sellout greatest hits package. George strait isn't one of todays few hit wonders. This guy has a ton of good songs. This doesn't even have all ""Amarillo by morning,"" I highly recommend ethier and or both greatest hits 1 and 2 and latest straitest greatest hits. Atleast there not doing it to Willie Nelson! Bottom line don't waste your hard earned dollar!"
3,A few flaws but works great.,"I have been using this for over a month. works good in all areas except under the nose. As the other review put it, you can notice the hair longer there than everywhere else. The vacumn action works well better than without that's for sure.Only solution for under the nose shaving is to remove the clip and use a comb? Just takes extra time and caution not to shave it all off."
2,Faulty trimmer,"After a brief search for a beard trimmer, I chose the Norelco based on product reputation and model features. This trimmer does a decent job and has some nice features. What ruined it for me (literally) was the difficulty removing and re-inserting the trimmer adjuster. I had to tug and cajole to take it off and had even a worse time putting it back on (which relies on an exact line-up of the plastic tabs). The thing finally broke and I pitched the trimmer in disgust.I next bought a Remington model 200 trimmer which is much simpler to use and up this point have been happy with it."
2,Long time Norelco user,"I've been using Norelco products for over 15 years (still have my first 700Series electric razor) and I never thought they could get something so wrong.I read every review I could find on this product and found some pretty mixed comments. Throwing caution to the wind, I made the leap. Today, I returned the unit for a full refund (glad they still have that 60 day satisfaction guarantee).Those who have written about the Accu-Vac's shoddy construction and cheap feel are absolutely right. In fact, mine literally fell apart in my hand (and into the sink) on only my second use.I know I'll find another Norelco beard trimmer that WILL work and feel better. They're still the best and you can't beat their guarantee or value. They just got this one wrong.Stay clear of this one. Purchase a simpler unit. One that ISN'T rechargeable or has a (useless) vacuum or too many adjustable and removable pieces. You'll be a lot happier."
2,Not at all what I hoped for,"This device has serious functional and aesthetic flaws. On a functional level, the vacuum is virtually useless so that at least 2/3 of the hair winds up on the counter or in the sink. I could have stayed with my non-vacuum trimmer! Also, the blades clog and everything comes apart to clean with a flimsy, I hope I don't break this, kind of plasticity.On an aesthetic level, this is very noisy and the noise is extremely unpleasant, sort of a sick screeching sound that I do not associate with quality. As soon as I turn it on, I want to turn it off as soon as possible. This just does not feel like a quality product. It is within a hair of it being worth the trouble to return it."
3,"Big shear, little suck","I really can't fully endorse this product. It works well enough as a beard clipper although it is pretty big for its intended purpose; almost as large as a full size barber shear. I thought my wife would appreciate the mess reduction but the anemic vacuum collects only about half of the beard clippings. The course nature of beards really makes this impossible without a shear that connects to your shop vac. It is kind of flimsey too. I haven't dropped mine but I doubt is would survive a single blow to the cutting head. My advice....look for the smallest, cheapest beard trimmer and use it in the bath tub or outdoors."
2,vs T-2000,"I purchased this to replace a several-year old T-2000. I found the 2000 very handy for use touching up my hair, sideburns, etc. The T970 is totally unsuitable for this purpose. The floating guard overhands the blade, unlike the 2000. Removing the guard still leaves the vacuum inlet in the way of the blade. The vacuum feature cannot be disabled and clogs the inlet with longer hairs with each pass, necessitating removing the hair before the next pass.The T970 may work fine for beard and mustache trimming (it's stated purpose), but is nearly useless for trimming hair. Just be aware.A plus is the battery charges much faster than the T-2000, although it uses a wall wart for power instead of a simple cord as on the 2000. You can also use the 970 by simply plugging it in, rather than waiting for it to charge. It's also noisier and less powerful than the 2000."
4,good product,"potental durability seems the only question- the product does exactly as described; wish it had NiH battery, though"
3,OK,"I bought this product 9 months ago and haven't had any problems with it. it is a good trimmer and the two attachments come in very handy. Although the vacuum collects some of the trimmed hair, it doesn't seem to be much different from trimmers without the facility. I am still having to wipe out the sink and everywhere near where i trim."
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","Works well, just not as easy to handle as the models that don't have a built-in vacuum."
1,Huge Disappointment,"This is my third Norelco beard trimmer and it's a huge disappointment. I'd send it back today if I could.Shoddy construction, imprecise cut, hard to assemble and reassemble. Other posters with negative comments are on target with this product.I would happily go back to one of their older products without all the ""new and improved"" junk in this model.Consider yourself warned."
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","I have used beard trimmers for over a decade. Most of that time I have used Norelco trimmers. For me their current ""latest greatest"" is a mixed bag. The vacuum feature has helped bring matrimonial harmony to the bathroom. When used per the directions the vacuum does a nice job of scooping up errand beard trimmings (good but not perfect.) If reducing beard scraps from your sink is a priority it's an excellent choice. It's a chunk nosier than it's non-vacuum predecessor. If you are looking for peace and quiet, I'd sharpen your scissors, or buy a trimmer without a vacuum. My only concern about the product is the increase 1/4 inch pace between the leading edge and the cutting blades that is caused by the addition of a vacuum. If you are looking for exact cuts, choose another trimmer and put a towel over your sink. All in, not bad, not great. I look forward to the evolution of vacuum models in the years ahead.Sharply yours,Jeff"
3,"Not bad, but not great, either","I liked the accuvac in the beginning; the hair reservoir is quite functional, even if it doesn't catch everything. I would have given the accuvac 4 stars were it not for the deafening noise it has started to emit after not even 1 year's use. It is a high-pitched screeching sound of exactly the kind you want to avoid at 6.30 AM, which is unfortunately the time I most often shave or trim. It may have been bad luck, but next time I am getting a Braun or a Philips."
2,"Works great, died young","I really did like how it worked, the vacuum was probably not that useful, but it did a good job of trimming.The biggest complaint I had was that after about a year of use, something burned out on it's circuit board and it stopped charging the battery. I popped the cover, unattached and re-attached the batteries, it worked fine (normal battery life time) for a couple charges and then reverted back to its broken way. And while in its broken state, it would do nothing more than get real hot along w/the wall outlet converter."
2,The old T7500 was better,"The moustache trimmer on the old T7500 was built-in and extremely convenient to use. On this one, you have to pull off the guide, then the cutter head, then stick on the moustache cutter. There's no place to even store the trimmer, so it's either rattling around in your drawer or the bottom of your toilet kit.Also, I found it a lot harder to get a consistent length cut with the ""Accu Control"" flexing comb guide than with the fixed guide of the older unit. I keep my beard pretty short -- this might not be a problem with a longer beard.So I returned the T970, and went back to my old T7500, even tho the battery no longer holds a charge and I have to run it off wall power."
2,buy a chain saw first,"The person who complained of the packaging is right. You need a chain saw to get into this thing. I used a boxcutter razor blade but when I was trying to get everything out, the 'precision mini trimmer' piece went sailing across my table. Now it's in 3 pieces and I have no idea how to put it back together. The thing hasn't even been plugged in yet, and I'm already screwed. I'm tempted to just box all the pieces up and send it back. Do the ""packaging engineers"" that design this type of packaging realize that somebody might actually try to remove the contents some day? This really is ridiculous!"
2,not close enough,This product does not allow you to get close enough to keep your beard or mustache closely trimmed.
3,No pop up trimmer,"This is my 3rd Norelco beard trimmer, and although I am very satisfied with the vacuum, the lack of an easily accessible small trimmer is very disappointing. If I want to trim above my lip, I have to take off the guard, and blade unit and replace with another. Pretty sad compared to the pop up under lip trimmer in models past."
3,From 1st time user,"I went for this for the ""vaccum"" it boasts of. I'm not completely satisfied with the vaccum performance. It works better with the cap on it but without cap vaccum manages to collect just 60-70% of hair.The head of the second trimmer is very small. I should say it is convenient only for side-locks.I'm okay with the trim but I'm, a little, disappointed with the ""accuvac"". I would suggest this only for those who want to use it with the cap."
3,norelco T970,"The beard trimmer is good but I don't care for the moustache trimmer,it was a lot better on my old one."
1,Died on me after 10 months,"Although the vacuum wasnt that great, it did its job well - but only while it lasted. The trimmer stopped working after only 10 months of service. Unacceptable!"
4,Satisfied so far,"I've had this trimmer for about a week and I'm very happy so far. I wanted to address 2 things that I was curious about before I made my purchase:1) This trimmer, while far from silent, is the quietest of the 3 that I've owned.2) The vacuum seems to get about 1/2 the hair so don't expect it to eliminate all of the mess. I think that it's pretty much impossible to get 100% of the hair clippings, but I'm happy for whatever help I can get.Finally, I also really like the battery indicator and the adjusting blade guide."
1,keystone cops,"As my title says this trimmer is the keystone cops of beard trimmers. The people who call this trimmer good must have peach fuzz for beards. The vacuum is a waste of money, it keeps getting clogged so you have to take it apart two or three times during trimming to keep it working. DON'T take apart the vacuum too much to clean as the spring inside is loose and it ended up in the trap of my sink. And finally forget the settings. I start off with a three setting for example and notice some of my beard is shorter than other parts and look at the settings and somehow the thing has slipped to #2. So then you do a 2 only to find out it has slipped again to 1. If you want a laugh buy this thing but if you want a trim dont buy it. Where is my old definition sixty which was battery operated but was better than this. Go back to the drawing board and do away with all the gadgetry and come out with something that trims beards properly and maintains the settings. Is that too much to ask??"
2,Zoom dial broken,"I agree with the reviewer that stated that this clipper has some design flaws that make it a poor choice for trimming. The zoom dial adjusts by itself even with the slightest pressure while trimming giving an uneven cut and closer trim than was desired. It needs to have a setting lock or the dial in a different location than right where you hold it. The vaccum function is so-so, I could live without it. Noise level is unusually high, but that's least of my concerns."
1,Piece of garbage,"First time I tried to re-attach length guage after using trimmer, gauge broke. Save yor money."
1,worthless waste of money,"A complete waste of money, the vacuum feature doesn't work, it cuts poorly and the first time I took the cutter off to clean it, it came apart needing twenty minutes to put back together. The beard height adjustment never worked correctly after that and I had to throw it away within 6 months.JUNK!Must be made in China"
1,"Trimmer, yes; vacuum definitely no","This trimmer works just fine as a trimmer, but any suggestion that you won't have a major clean-up job afterwards is just wrong.The ""vac"" part of the ""accu-vac"" is a complete farce."
1,The worst trimmer I have ever used!,"This item worked okay for the first month. I haven't been able to get an even trim since using this product. After that, the vac quit working and the blade guard split in three pieces. This is a total piece of junk!"
5,Excellent Product for current Technology,I purchased the Norelco to maintain my stubble beard and it has maintained it perfectly. It is easy to clean and battery life is excellent so far.you have to keep a slower speed so the vacuum can grab all the little hairs but most of the time I just do it over the sink so I can perform my cut quicker.Eventually they could produce a stronger vacuum but then you will have a leaf blower by your ears.The Length adjustment is easy and the flexi-head allows for simplicity to getting an even cut while maintaing a strong quality feeling product.I would recommend this item to another person to purchase. Excellent Investment.
2,An hour stuggle resulted in finally breaking the trimmer,"I braved the many poor reviews and bought this trimmer. Although it didn't seem to first trim closely enough (stubble) at first, it got better as I learned to use it.But after removing the top comb attachment to use the precision mini-trimmer, it was absolutely impossible to put it back on. I could how it was supposed to go back on but it simply wouldn't work. I spent forever and finally decided maybe it actually did need a bit of force. I was wrong. I'm sending it back tomorrow, and I expect a full refund."
2,Quality problems led to me returning 2 of them,"The product seemed to work well -- the vaccum feature worked as advertised, and I was pleased. But, as other reviewers complained, it was very difficult to place the guide back on the unit. Within a week, I managed to break the unit where the guide could not be adjusted anymore. After returning the unit, the 2nd trimmer I received worked fine, but was much much louder than the first. Something must have been wrong with the motor because when I pressed it to my face, the motor would slow down.I bought a Wahl vaccum trimmer instead and have been much happier (plus I saved $10)."
4,Great Trimmer,I find the trimmer works very well and is easy to use. The only disadvantage (and it's slight) is that you have to switch attachments when using the fine trimmer. This is the first trimmer I have ever bought. I was referred to Norelco by a neighbor who loved his (different model). I have no complaints.
2,"Works decent, but issues","The blades cut nice, but battery life could be better. The vacuum does actually work well, I was surprised. However the curved long design at the end makes an even shave under the nose impossible. Hair directly under the nose is noticably longer than at the lip. Frustrating!"
5,Sookie Stackhouse series by Charlaine Harris,"Fabulously funny. These are delightful, light-hearted read. You've heard the saying ""Don't take life serious, you won't get out of it alive anyway""?Well, these books may test that theory. These vampires are just so alive. Sookie is so funny, even when faced with danger, she comes up with a good quip.I read everyone of these books once and some that I read several years ago, I read again and still found them enjoyable.These are not your Anne Rice Vampires--these have real character."
4,Dead to the World,"Love the Southern Vampire series. I want to be Sookie Stackhouse! Started with ""Dead Until Dark"" Labor Day weekend. I am now awaiting the arrival of ""Defenitly Dead"" and it is not even Memorial Day! Try the first book and you too will be hooked."
4,Love This Series,"I just finished reading Dead to the World and it may be my favorite in the series so far. I just started reading the series after becoming a fan of True Blood. I really liked seeing a different side to Eric and seeing him as a romantic. One thing I was curious about was Eric knows that he was never a Christian, but he has memory loss and can't remember his past. Well time to start book 5."
3,Not my favorite,"I am a huge fan of True Blood on HBO and when I discovered the Sookie series I was beyond thrilled! I read the first 3 books in 3 days. Could not put them down. I have to say this book was not my favorite. I enjoyed seeing the Sookie/Eric relationship build but I wish it happened when he wasn't under a spell. I was kinda hoping it was an act just to get in her bed while Bill was away. I also have to say that while I find Eric sexy and entertaining, I really do love Bill. I am hoping to read more of Sookie and Bill and less of Sookie and every other male supe that wants to bed her! Just my opinion. On to the next."
3,"The ""Real"" Eric is Better.","This is the fourth book in the Sookie Stackhouse series, the series on which the HBO show True Blood is based. This book develops further the relationship between Sookie and Eric, with Bill largely absent in Peru for the entire book. Essentially, Sookie is drawn into helping Eric when she finds him at the beginning of the book naked by the side of the road with his memory wiped. Because I really liked the ""original"" Eric with memory intact, I had some problems with this premise. But the book does a good job continuing to advance the plot line of Sookie's involvement with so-called ""Supes"" (supernatural creatures), bringing in witches, Wiccans and fairies to round out the group with the vampires, shifters and werewolves we've met in previous books. If you liked the first three books, you should enjoy this one as well although it was not my favorite of the series so far."
3,Kind of boring.,I found this book a bit boring and it seemed to drag on. Sookie appears to be attracted to every guy in the friggen book series. Harris doesn't pay much attention to detail (Sookie seems to jump from one thing to another in seconds) and there's too much dialogue for my liking. It was okay but I don't think I'll buy another one of her books.
4,Dead to the World,"This book was great. Fun to read and fast paced. I had read a couple of this series in the past, but it was years ago. It was easy to pick up the story line and I didn't feel lost at all while reading this. Vampire Bill is gone for most of the book, vampire Eric has lost his memory, and brother Jason is missing. There is resolution to the Debbie/Alcide storyline. The arrival of a fairy, and interesting developments for Jason. Lots going on in this book.Sookie is a likable character and it is easy to get caught up in her story. Reading this made me remember how much I enjoyed this series, and I am going to make an effort to get caught up with it."
3,Hmmm...,"I am one of the world's largest vampire fans. There isn't a whole lot of vampire films (even bad ones) or books I haven't read. As being from the south, I really enjoyed this series. The first two books were beyond excellent. I found myself as a mother of two staying up to all hours of the night to finish them, but with these last two books I have been slightly disappointed in how the book has been led to almost make Bill non-existant. I found him the strongest lead man in the first two books and now I am finding myself missing him. Although Eric is very appealing, I want Bill back!! I like the monogomy in the first two books and I find Sookie being kinda handed around in the last two. All in all, the book has some high points to its appeal. I just miss my vamp man!!"
4,Can't wait for the next one!,"This was another great read about Sookie and her off-beat world. I so enjoy the fact that she's such a normal girl despite (or because of) her mind-reading abilities. The only aspect of this book that didn't work for me was the Eeevil Witch coven storyline which wasn't very well developed and seemed very haphazardly put together and, in the end, didn't make very much sense because I never really understood their motives all that well. What did work was the unexpected romantic interlude. I think it was just what Sookie needed to get her mind off of all of troubles ;)I'm looking forward to the next Sookie/Bill/Eric/Sam adventure."
4,Sookie just keeps getting better!,"I'm loving this series by Charlaine Harris. Her characters are involving and vividly drawn and her stories have interesting twists and turns. What's aggravating is the change to hardcover and the corresponding raise in price . . . not that Ms. Harris doesn't deserve it! I just don't see the rationale for light, fun, fast reads being put into hardcover."
1,Just another cover on a old book,They are making me so angry that they do not tell me I have already bought this book. It just has a different cover on it.
1,I Miss Bill the Vampire -- a lead character just disappears,"In Book 3 Bill the Vampire is kidnapped and out of action for virtually the entire book. In Book 4 (Dead to the World) he has gone (inexplicably) to Peru. I kept reading and reading, expecting him to return, because he is a complex and high-quality character. The characters that replaced him in the story line are one-dimenional, and there are too many of them. The whole series seems to spin out of control. I finally gave up on the book about 2/3 through and didn`t finish it."
3,She's got me hooked,"Sookie Stackhouse #4. It's a new year in Bon Temps, and Sookie makes a Resolution: ""I just hope to not be beaten up...I don't want to go to the hospital. I don't want to see a doctor...so my resolution is to stay out of trouble."" Yes, I actually chuckled out loud.All along, Sookie has been telling us, once the vampires came out into the open, who knows what other supernatural creatures were lurking in the shadows? We find out about some other supernatural creatures, alright. Bill is out of the country, so we don't see much of him at all; Eric had his memory wiped out, so we get to see a vulnerable side of him, along with his perfect backside; the witches are out in full force; the weres have more family members than we expected; and we are introduced to one character whose existence still has me scratching my head.Like the other books in this series, there was a lot of action, a lot of blood, and Sookie is growing into one tough cookie.[..]"
4,Bloody Sexy!,"Dead to the World is yet another fun installment in the Sookie Stackhouse series. More characters are introduced and more supernatural drama unfolds. For those that love a creative twist to a southern mystery, this book will not disappoint. HOWEVER, in this 4th book, Sookie's romantic exploits are taken up about 50 notches. I have no idea what Charlaine Harris's love life is like but she was definitely at a hormonal apex when she wrote Dead to the World. HOLY SEX SCENES. I read the majority of the book on an over-booked plane. There's nothing like reading about ""trembling fingers"" and ""throbbing members"" whilst surrounded by 200 men, women and children. AWKWARD.In any case, there is plenty of suspense and magical intrigue to keep the story entertaining!Rating: 4 out of 5 starsSuggested With: Solitude ;)"
4,"Too Many ""Supe's""","I am really enjoying reading this series for the first time. However, my brain is getting bogged down with the ever evolving new supernatural player's that become involved in each book. First there is a telepath, a shape-shifter, etc. etc. etc. It is kind of taxing to keep track of who is what and their connections. I love Eric, and he has a large part in this book. I really miss Vampire Bill. Sookie kind of just tosses her relationship with him in the dumpster after the last book. No hard feelings, no ""yearning"", etc. They need couples counseling."
5,Sookie ROCKS!!!,"I won't recap the story since so many other folks have done a great job with it already. I just wanted to say that THESE BOOKS ARE SUPER!!! They are funny and exciting. The characters are just like folks in a small Southern town. I so very HIGHLY RECOMMEND them to everyone! Charlaine Harris has the brightest clearest voice..You'll love it and all the folks both normal and not so normal in Bon Temps, LA!!!"
5,I love this series,"Each time I finish another book in this series, I wish they were longer. Unfortunately, this book is the latest in the series, so I'll have to wait a while for Ms. Harris' next installment. I've also read Laurel K. Hamilton's vampire series and I like them as well, but Sookie is a little easier to stomach; not as bloody as Anita, but she is getting tougher. It's been a neat and believable evolution of her character. I loved Eric in this book and wasn't too broken up about Bill. Can't wait to see what happens next!"
3,"Excellent writing, weird places for chracters","The writing in this book is really well done, the author seems to have hit their stride. That's the good news...The bad, for me, was a few things. I didn't buy the Eric thing and I missed Bill. He was a sidelined character. The odd part is that I liked the plot, overall, I just don't like where the author took the characters.Not really sure how else to explain it. Good book, just didn't fit in. I dunno, hopefully Bill will play a more prominent role in future books."
3,"3.5 out of 5 rating...Review from So Many Books, So Little Time","Another installment into the life of Sookie Stackhouse. I have been finding all of these books pretty average. Not bad, but nothing great either. This book was a little better than the first three. I liked this Eric, who didn't remember who he was. I liked that he was humble and I liked his relationship and interactions with Sookie. I also liked the action in this story. I'm on to the next book in the series, Dead as a Doornail."
2,Romantic and full of intrigue,"I don't like that Sookie is the narrator, because we as the audience miss very much of the action and the story. There are also, things that are irrelevant to the story, like for example. "" I woke up this morning, was 4 o'clock in the afternoon, then I took a bath, and it felt so good, then I made some coffee, and someone pound at the door. I didn't know who it was,when I opened it, it was _______"" It's always the same thing, if she goes out in the car , she goes to the left, then to the right, then to the left again.... It's annoying!"
2,Nice book,"Dead to the world is a nice read, it's nothing special and fits in the middle of the book. I had the feeling it was an introduction of the next book. Sookie enters a new relationship *SPOILER* it's not Bill/Alcide :( and she matures a bit more.It's nice to see Sookie develope and explore the world. I still prefer the earlier books but book 4 takes the story to a new level. What I didn't like were the inconsistences in this book and the new characters who I think were quickly created to get the story going. The plots seem rushed and quickly over before the reader comprehends what it's about. One of the treats this book offered were funny scenes with Pam and Jason, which I love. Unfortunately, it isn't as captivating as the earlier and following books but like I say above, it is a nice read and explains the mysterious world of the Sookieverse with the various creatures surrounding the heroine."
5,Love Love Love,"This is by far my favorite Sookie Stackhouse book yet. Given I was already Team Eric due to the show, but Eric losing his memory shows another side of him that you wouldn't expect he has. Even though it's a temporary thing I loved Eric and Sookie's lust becoming love story. Throw in a witch war and Debbie finally getting what was coming to her and it was hard to put this book down."
5,The best book & my favorite from the series so far!,I love this book its the best and my favorite from the series so far and I haven't even finished it yet...I won't ruin it for the ones who haven't read it yet but damn I wish I could find a man like Eric who wouldn't hesitate to take a bullet for me. ohh and not to mention the sex scene wow ;)
4,Less Bill is fine with me!,"I think I enjoyed this book a little more than the last couple because I've watched the True Blood HBO series and now have a voice and picture in my head for different characters. Also, there's very little Bill in this book, which suits me fine because in this series, I'm more of a were/shifter fan -- Alcide or Sam, anyone? Instead, we get a lot of Eric, though in a form we've never seen before. I enjoyed Sookie testing out her independence a bit, even if she's not entirely happy with some of the choices she makes. I liked how there are some events that happen here that will definitely change Sookie's future -- I can't wait to see where the story's going!"
5,One of My favorites in the series,"This is one of my favorite books in the sookie stackhouse series. I really enjoyed the eric/sookie interaction. I also loved that bill is gone for most of the book, cause without him being gone he would be over at sookie's all the time making sure eric was behaving."
3,Fun and suspenseful,"This is my first Charlaine Harris book, and I must say I enjoyed it mightily. Harris handles her heroine's ""disability"" sensitively and in an interesting, fresh manner. The plot zips along suspensefully, and the characters are all pretty well fleshed out.Only real negative, I'd say, would be that the threat posed by the witches never really materializes all that well. They never seem to truly go into high gear as active threats to the heroine and her friends."
4,Bring back Bill!,"The fourth book in the Sookie Stackhouse series has a better story and more action than book 3, but my favorite vamp, Bill Compton has maybe 5 pages in the whole book? Eric is the romantic interest in this installment and for me, that just fell flat. What saved this one for me was the introduction of the community of Hotshot and the supernatural residents."
5,Definitely Dead,"The book was great. For anyone who hasn't read about Sookie's adventures, your really missing out. Charlaine Harris writes about vampires as people. The stories are interesting,funny,and sometimes sad. I own them all to date. It's hard to put them down once you start reading. I hope Sookie has a long wonderful life, I look forward to reading about it."
5,Great book,This is awesome book collection. I am a huge Fan of good Vampire Stories.(Real Vampire tales not that Twilight crap) Charlaine Harris's books take you on a wild southern vampire ride. This book if to adults. if you love the show True Blood you will love the books
4,Reading with Tequila,"Dead to the World had all of the key elements (less Bill, more Alcide, more Bubba and a lot more Eric) that made me love Club Dead, but it just wasn't as stunning. I've come to realize I am very much a part of ""Team Eric."" His personality is such a force of its own, I can imagine how anyone could not love reading the character. Dead to the World has a massive amount of Eric, but we really don't get to experience his personality. While key to the storyline, it made me feel his presence was wasted and was kind of a letdown. If you can get past the lack of true Eric-ness, Dead to the World is another fantastic Southern Vampire novel."
5,Charlaine Harris Book Review,"This is a great series of books! I enjoy reading then, but wish they would have had the TV series follow the books. There are main characters in the TV series that are not portrayed in the books like the TV series at all! Overall good reading though!"
3,At least I finished it...,"This was a good book. Unfortunately, I got sidetracked while reading it, and it took me over two weeks to read it, unlike the previous three, which took me a day or less a piece. I wish I could have given it a better score, but it just wasn't as suspenseful as the previous installments, which is why it took so long to read. I absolutely didn't like Eric in this book, and the Were-animal/people are just a little too fantastical. Also, when an author starts talking about witches and spells, I automatically lose interest. I am not afraid of them, I don't think they are interesting... I really hope there aren't anymore of them in the series. This is the first negative review I have written for Charlaine Harris, and I honestly do apologize. I so loved all the previous volumes in this series. I just started book 5 this morning, and it is starting out wonderfully."
3,Guilty pleasure,"** spoiler alert ** Eric loses his memory, prompting some very Twilight-esque moments and badly-written love scenes between him and Sookie. Lots of scoffing and eye-rolling on my part, but I can't say I wasn't entertained."
4,Kevin Max,Great addition to my growing Christmas music cd collection.. They have such a good sound. All ages would like it.
3,the right formula but the wrong presentation,"I saw these guys open up for soulfly a while back and they tore up the place. They have an impressive live show and lots of energy...they just couldn't put it on tape. The music hits all the right notes but it seems like its missing something. The album sounds like it was recorded in some kids basement and is mixed terribly. This is a shame because these guys have real potential. Go see them live if you are able to. The album, however, is only good for a couple of spins."
1,Horrible,"Think about how much thought went into the name ""Shuvel"" and then think about how much could have been left over for the actual music. Then walk away."
5,Sweet,"First off, if you give this cd a bad review, you'll let others know that you have no good taste in music, and that's a given fact. It's [stinks] that not a whole lot of people know about Shuvel, because they happen to be a very talented band. Honestly though, I don't think they are as good as Limp Bizkit's music (Btw, by saying LB's music, I'm leaving Fred Durst out of it because he is the main reason why LB is hated, when he should be the only one who is hated, not the entire band) but I enjoy how they get their messages across with songs such as ""Set It Off."" It has no metaphors or whatnot behind it so when you hear it (the video helps too) you'll know that it's not only about the Columbine shootings, but it's also about those other high school shootings as well. Anyways, when you get a chance buy this cd, and don't listen to people from Turner cuz they don't know anything."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I saw these guys at Ozzfest and was pretty optimistic about them. The CD just doesn't do much for me. There is not anything special about this CD that you can't find on a ton of other CD's. Either Shuvel needs to do a better job of capturing their live show and put it on the next album, or else they aren't going to make it very far. The potential is there, but this CD doesn't show it. If you like basic rap metal that is more on the rap side, pick up this CD. Otherwise, keep on looking."
2,jtrei,"This album doesn't do Shuvel justice. I saw them live at Ozzfest and was ecstatic about their performance. Everyone I knew was. We all went out and bought the CD when it came out and spent the next week bitching about how bad the CD was. Live=Awesome. CD=Terrible. I can only hope that the show we saw exhibited some kind of ""maturing"" process. From the difference in the CD to the live show, I say it happened. I really expect their second CD to be much, much better. By the way, if you're interested in this kind of sound, check out Mr. Plow. They've got it down. Hard to find, but definitely worth it."
3,Some colors better than others,"I am an avid macaron baker (the French macarons not the American ones.) I've had some problems with the yellow messing up my shell batter. I feel like the color is not as intense, therefore I have to use more of it to get the desired color. I'd been using the limited range of powdered colors that I have, and thought that switching over to the gel stuff would be okay but it has been troublesome for me. Regardless, the colors (save yellow) are bright and vibrant."
2,Not what I expected!,"I ordered this to try because of all the great reviews, but was not pleased with the outcome. The color didn't seem to be any different than what I could get using Wilton icing coloring. Also my icing started to separate in the bag while I was trying to decorate the cake which also made it darker than the icing I had already put on the cake. I guess it was separating from the heat of my hands holding the bag. I have never had this problem with the Wilton colors. I guess I will continue to look for a coloring that can make my icing brighter and darker shades."
5,Food coloring made easy!,"Colors were brilliant. After my gel colors in the little jars had dried up, I was looking for another type of food coloring and these have met my needs. Love having just to squeeze drops out of the bottles rather than messing with toothpicks. This is the clean and easy way to use food coloring. Would highly recommend it. Haven't used all the colors yet but by Easter, they will be used."
2,No better than Wilton,"I bought this set mainly for the red. I bake and decorate with frosting/icing quite a bit, so I was excited to get so many colors that were supposed to be of better quality than Wilton. I used an entire bottle of red in 3 cups of buttercream frosting. The darkest it would get was a watermelon color. By the time I got to that point, my frosting had broken and looked terrible. The royal blue wasn't much better. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because I haven't used all of the colors yet, just red and blue. I will stick with store bought red frosting and Wilton gel colors for everything else."
5,Ateco12 - Food Coloring,Very vibrant colors....the box makes it easy to store...I wish the coloring was a little bit thicker tho...you have to be careful not to use too much...would definately recommend this item overall!!
3,Lacked depth of colour,I purchased these for Bath bombs the consistency was good but he depth of color that I was expecting wasn't there.
1,"Loved the concept, but the product was poor quality!","These earrings, though difficult to put on, were so comfortable to wear. I just loved the option of reversability, but in less than two weeks the screw came through the ""gold"" stud side. Hope to return them if I can find the dealers name."
2,The Best??? Not Really,"First of all, the picture of Jimmy on the cover is clearly NOT from the ""Early Years"". Secondly, this set is very deceptively titled. These are not the best songs from Jimmy's early days, but instead the leftovers that hadn't already been released for his record label (Barnaby Records) in the early '70s. Basically, this is folk music with the silly early '70s social conscience you'd expect and some ever so slightly more refined numbers with backing strings. Even at the price, this is not a bargain...unless you're one of those weird completists who's had too many margaritas."
1,Save your money and time,"This book is nothing more than a piece of self-promotional fluff --a marketing tool for the author's seminars and speaking gigs.It offers little of substance either in the way of managing your finances or handling the emotional reactions to a windfall. It has all the depth of a sound bite. My sense is that Bradley is the type of person who believes her own PR.If the author does as poor a job managing her clients' money as she did in writing this book, I suspect they'll experience 'sudden poverty'."
1,Logitech-Speed-Force-Accessory-Pack,"Beware - The KNEE pad in this accessory pack, does not FIT a PS3, Driving Force GT Wheel - Works on the old PS2 wheels only - Beware!"
4,Work Better Than I Thought,It works very well with my LogiTech GameCube wheel. Originally I thought using my knees to hold the wheel may be very awkward. Turn out it works just fine. The paddels also works fine. It didn't slide around on the floor; the fact that my floor is carpeted probably helps minimizing the chance that it will slide around.Jay Chan
3,backstage secrets: on the road w/rush,the content of the dvd is fabulous.its the quality of the data and the manufacturing/ burning of the disc that leaves alot to be desired. thru-out the entire 2 disc set the bottom portion of the television screen appears blurry and wavey. granted i dont have the highest tier equipment but none of my other rush disc's does this--in fact none of my other stuff does it all.
2,Behind the Rush without the Rush,"This is a behind the scenes look at setting up for Rush concerts. I had done this kind of work for one summer, so i knew a lot about what they were talking about. I am a huge Rush fan, but this is one item that I could do without. Seeing there stage set-up is not as cool as seeing them perform on stage. Love Rush, and I know that the crew works hard for the shows, but I do not need a chronicle of their work. I say pass on this DVD."
1,It's all the daughter-in-law's fault!,"I was really hoping that I'd be able to get some true insights from this book. I love my husband dearly, and I wanted to have a good happy relationship with his mother. But we've always been distant, and I haven't known how to get through it.Unfortunately, I didn't get any help from this book! Its focus is on presenting a set of stories in which the daughters-in-law are completely nasty, and it doesn't provide any information at all on how to work through a slightly strained relationship where nothing 'bad' has actually happened. As well, the strong religious focus turned me off. This book was most definitely a disappointment."
1,This author doesn't get it...,It is clear that this author is extremely one-sided and does not get the complexities of the issues at hand. ALL relationships are two-sided and these relationships only present one side of the coin.If the author really believes what she has written then it will be obvious to all readers why she does not get along with her daughter-in-law. She is an EXPERT in how not to get along!
1,Only get this if you're a mother in law,"I got this book to help with my strained relationship with my mother in law and all the book did was tell stories about how terrible daughter in laws are and how the daugher in laws should basically worship the ground the mother in law walks.After each story about the wicked daughter in law in had questions to ponder and no answers. I was hoping for some tips on how to better deal with my mother in law. The only tip I got was not to recommed this book to any of my friends who have strained relations with her in laws.The author who wrote it has a very antiquated look on the relationship between mother and daughter in law and didn't tackle any of the issues - juggling work, family and in laws that I think we can all use some help on. Pass on this book"
4,Great information,It was great to read and realize that I wasn't the ONLY MIL having the same issues and the solutions for some of the problems have helped me tremedously.....thank you!
1,SANTANA GREATEST HITS,"I AM VERY DISAPOINTED WITH THE C.D ,YOU DID NOT DISPLAY THE SONGS THAT WERE ON IT OR SHOW THE LABEL ,IT WAS NOT WHAT I WANTED .IN FUTERE ORDERS I WILL WATCH MY ORDERS AND I HOPE YOU WILL MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT I ORDER. SINCERY YOURS AL VANDERBEEK."
4,For NY Dolls fans,"The Doll's new live CD ""Pre-Crash Condition - Live From The Royal Festival Hall"" is everything a Dolls fan could ask for, except the rising from of the ashes of one guitar God named Johnny Thunders. Oh well, we can't have everything. They roll through their set as if they had been doing this for years, even though it had been 29 years since their last gig.As much fun as this CD is, I'm not sure this should be anybody's introduction to the New York Dolls. Get the studio albums ""The New York Dolls"" and the aptly named ""Too Much Too Soon"". That's the Dolls at their finest, if that was ever possible.""Pre-Crash Condition - Live From The Royal Festival Hall"" is the happy reunion of the surviving members and a trip back in time for long-time fans. I'm loving it."
5,Leak free and keeps coffee piping hot!,My husband uses this every day. The coffee stays hot for hours. Sometimes he returns home with coffee in his thermos and it's still hot! He throws it in his bag and it never ever leaks. The cap doubles as a cup on the go. Awesome purchase!
5,Great Thermos,I've had this Thermos for over 3 years and it still amazes me how long it keeps my tea and coffee hot.
5,A Great Investment!,I don't know why I didn't buy this insulated thermos/bottle sooner. I was skeptical when I read other reviews about it not containing heat for more than several hours but it does. When I opened the container a day later the fluid that I'd poured in the morning before was still warm. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Highly recommended.
4,Good Thermos,"This was a good thermos. It worked as advertised, and kept the temperatures stable. Very durable, did not break, or leak."
4,Great thermos!,This is a very good thermos. It doesn't leak. The only problem is it is bigger than I planned and doesn't fit inside my briefcase very well.
4,Good deal for the money.,This is a good deal for the money. It keeps the water warm for a long time. The only downside is the size of the bottle does not fit into most diaper bags.
1,High Priced - Low Quality,Very disappointing! Spend your money somewhere else. I threw away a perfectly good but old made in the USA Thermos bottle and bought this made in China Nissan 0.79-Quart Stainless-Steel INSULATED Bottle back in June of 2005. Ten Months later this bottle stopped keeping anything warm and would feel warm to the touch after you poured warm liquids in it - evidence of the loss of its insulating function. I think it lost the vacuum in the cavity which I think is the method used to insulate the liquid inside. When you spend $25 one would think it's a good quality product - Think again!
2,no better than any other thermos,"I'm giving this 2 stars just for its looks. It is a nice-looking thermos but so far has not proven any better at keeping things hot than any other one on the market. I poured boiling water into the thermos, sealed it and let it sit for 20 minutes or so. I emptied the water, put a filter cone filled with coffee on top and poured boiling water through that into the thermos. Sealed it up, took it to work, had a small cup of coffee. About 5 hours later, mid-afternoon, I poured what was not really hot coffee for a 2nd small cup and when I went to freshen that it was totally luke warm. I suppose I could buy a little coffee maker, brew the coffee in that and pour that straight into the thermos, but doing it the way I am, which may inherently result in less hot coffee, is simpler and how I want to prepare it. Seems like, even brewing it the way I am, should stay much hotter, much longer."
5,Excellent hot/cool beverage holder,"I purchased this bottle for tennis and am quite happy with it. The mouth is easily wide enough to fit ice cubes. You can drink from it with the cup removed but the stopper in place and only slightly unscrewed- prevents spills.The interior does not appear to be lined so there shouldn't be problems with it leaching toxins, which is the main reason I bought it."
2,Short-lived joy,"My husband got this in October 2009 (9 months ago). We live where it is very cold in the winter), and he gets to work at 6 AM. He was thrilled with this thermos, because it kept his tea HOT well into the afternoon. A few weeks ago, he noticed that it isn't keeping his tea hot, even 3 hours. I think the vacuum seal let go, as there is no glass to break. Very disappointing. Yes, its under warranty, but you have to send it back, which is a hassle."
4,"excellent product, keeps my smoothies frozen","works well, by keeping my smoothies frozen when I taken it for lunch. I have opened it after 3 hours at room temp to 80 deg, with the smoothie still frozen. Size is good also, not too big, about the size of a fifth of liquor, without the neck.Only wish the opening was a bit bigger/wider. Would buy again or as a gift."
4,Nissan 26 oz. Traval Thermos,We really like it. It keeps coffee hot for a long time. We suggest warming the bottle prior to putting the hot coffee in. No leaks here.
5,Keeps hot for a very long time,"Generally I leave home in the morning and come back at late evening. I don't like the coffee sold at my work place. I bought this thermos bottle so that I can drink the coffee that I made at home in the morning throughout the whole day. I thought that my coffee will be warm (rather than hot) at the end of the day, but I was amazed when I found that my coffee is still very hot even at the evening."
5,excellent product,"I bought this in April 2009, three year now, and i must say that im completely satisfy with this thermos.on average, this lil guy keep my drink hot for at least 8 hrs, i have never try to put cold drink in it so i cannot say anything on that aspect. another plus is that it is very easy to clean.only minor suggestion is that i think it could be better if the inside lid wasn't make out of plastic"
5,"It keeps things COLD, too","Something I learned in college, from my paleontology professor - keep a vacuum insulated bottle of ice water in the vehicle. After a long, hot, dusty day of fossil hunting or other geological exertions...COLD water is a delightful, sensual pleasure."
4,Great for overnight use,"My husband and I use this to keep our water warm for our overnight feedings for our infant son. It takes a while for our faucet water to heat up, so having warm water all night is great!"
5,Love it.,"Great for holding just enough coffee to get me through the day. Easily packed on my bicycle, it's become my little friend."
4,no leaks,"Seems to work fine. I haven't used it a lot, but it does not leak. Some of the reviews seemed to say that, but mine seems fine. The plastic drinking cap tastes like plastic."
2,"Leaks sometimes, good otherwise","It keeps coffee warm for hours, but it also leaks unless you screw on the top in a very particular way. You have to meticulously to make sure it wont. Kind of a hassle."
4,Good thermos - good value,"This thermos easily holds 750ml of liquid (little more that 3 cups). Primed with hot tap water, the liquid inside (if hot) stays hot into the afternoon (if put in there in morning). Cleans easily and is slender enough not to take up a ton of room in my laptop backpack. Have not used with cold beverages yet. Would recommend this thermos to anyone looking for 3 cup capacity."
3,"Works okay, I guess.","I use it to hold coffee during the day. It looks good and does keep the coffee reasonably hot all day. There is an almost immediate drop in temperature, though, compared to coffee left on the hot plate, even when the thermos is preheated with hot water. Perhaps I just expected too much, I had hoped that for the first hour the coffee would stay as hot as when it was first brewed."
5,Small but durable,"Small but big enough for what we were looking for. Keeps the hot items (coffee, tea) hot and the cold items (juice, water) cold. Able to put in backpack without a problem. Also very durable as we took it through its paces during a recent camping trip. Got dropped down a hill and other than some scratch marks everything was great.."
1,Very Disappointing,"I owned a small Nissan in the past and it was wonderful, this model however is far from that! Beverages only stay hot two or so hours."
5,Learn how to use it and will have hot water for many many hours,"This bottle is a perfect devise for storing hot water-hot coffe, etc. Because of its size, it can be stored at your bag, carry on your hands, everything. Makes almost 800mL, daily dose of coffee. I use it for store hot water for drink my ""Chimarro"" (Brasilian mate tea).How to obtain excellent results: Fill the bottle with hot water and leave it for some minutes...5min until you wait the water you are going to use gets hot or boiled...or when you are waiting the coffee machine. Then save the hot water of the ""pre-warming step""(for not loose water, greener thought of the day) and put your boiled water, hot tea or coffee, etc. I have prepare today at 7am the bottle with almost 80 Celcius water. Now is 12.30pm and the water is still very hot.Conclusion: Buy it."
2,Only hot for 8-10 hours,"I give a very high expectation for the 26-ounce Stainless-Steel Insulated Bottle. However, it can only keep my water for 8-10 hours. Far less than the manufacture promised 24 hours."
3,Everything great except the rubber gasket in the stopper,"I agree with the positive reviewers, except the rubber gasket in the stopper - it transmits a terrible plastic-rubbery taste to hot coffee. It gets worse as the gasket ages. I bought additional stoppers with gaskets and I have to rotate them to keep the terrible taste to a tolerable level. (The gaskets only come with the stoppers, available from the Thermos 800 number.) Has anyone come across a product (Thermos, gasket) or technique that doesn't make your coffee taste so bad?"
3,Very good thermos but....,Pros: It does the main job of keeping the liquid inside hot very well. The longest I have kept any liquid inside it is 8 hrs and it came out hot (with steam).Bought it over a year ago...no damages.Steel finish is good.Quantity of liquid it packs is sufficient for three persons.Cons: The inside material has a odor of it's own and it gets into the liquid and it's conspicuous(..but not off-putting).
3,"great bottle, poor cup","The insulated bottle is excellent--keeps coffee piping hot, and there is no glass to break, seals to leak, etc. Unfortunately, the cup is not at all insulated, so you can't pick it up for a few minutes after you pour the hot coffee into it. For a $35 thermos, I expected better."
3,"Good, but not as good as I expected.","I bought this thermos to keep my coffee hot. I pre-heat the thermos with hot water while brewing my coffee at 5am. I usually pour my first cup around 8am. The coffee is still very warm (almost hot), but not hot enough for my preference after I add my half and half. Others on here claim their coffee remains piping hot well into the afternoon. I was disappointed that I didn't have the same experience."
4,"5 capfuls, no leaks, keeps it hot","Pretty easy review. It keeps liquids very hot, if not scalding. It has enough for 5 cap-fuls, which is nothing for a coffee addict like me, but enough for about 2 hours of sipping. I've been impressed thus far with the pouring and with the lack of leaking."
3,A useful summary,"This product is only a summary of the well-known book. Though I would have liked a deeper detail, it is enough to understand the basic ideas that Mr. Covey expresses in his book. Good enough if you do not have enough time to read..."
4,Varios principios utiles para mejorar la vida,"Covey de veras da unos principios utiles y faciles de comprender para mejorar la vida. Por ejemplo, sugiere el siguiente ejercicio para ayudarte a comprender lo que realmente quieres de la vida. Imaginate que estas en tus propios funerales de aqui a tres anos (no es para deprimirte; sigue leyendo). Ahora imagina que hay cuatro personas discursando en los funerales: alguien de tu familia, un amigo, un companero de trabajo, y una persona de tu iglesia o otra organizacion de servicio a que perteneces. ?Que te gustaria oir que estas personas digan de ti? Al meditar en eso, me dio unas ideas en como podria reenfocar mi vida.Tambien ofrece unas ideas nuevas en la manera de lograr las metas verdaderas. En final, escuchar estas ideas vale la pena, pero da poco beneficio si no las utilizas en la vida poco despues de escucharlas. (!Tengo que hacerlo yo!)"
1,Only worth the price you pay for the cd. Not much.,"This Cd does contain songs that are not frequently heard on the radio, (On The Dark Side, When The Going Get Tough, Im' Free (Heaven Helps The Man) but, if you are looking for the original artist who performed these songs, you may want to look else where. All of the songs done on this cd are by a 80's cover band. Did not like this cd. The group sounded awful. Your money is better spent on other cds. All Songs on cd are performed by Flavor."
1,Even Symantec is giving up on this one!,"Symantec had tons of problems with Norton Utilities 8, which is part of Systemwroks 3. It isn't compatible with OS X 10.3 and has many problems with earlier systems. See Macfixit, Macintouch, or other news sources for evidence. Now Symantec announced that they are discontinuing development of everything but antivirus and network security products for the Mac. Don't buy broken software from a company who refuses to fix it. Buy DiskWarrior instead."
1,Symanted has the WORST IN SERVICE OUT THERE!!!!,I was not able to boot my G4 Laptop from my Norton System Works 3.0. According to the company website I had to get a new disk. I called for the first time this past Wednesday. After better than 30 minutes on hold I finally got a customer service person who told me I needed permission from TECH SUPPORT and that they were closing early sorry. On Thursday I called Tech Support and after 3 rude Tech People finally someone gave me an order number to give to the Customer Service people. Tech doesn't accept orders. It is now Friday and I have yet to get a Customer Service person on again.There is no prompt for people who need a disk shipped. There isnt a Mac area promt so I have to go through the General Help menu. NO ONE COMES TO THE PHONE! I pity those that have to deal with this company.They should turn their anti-virus scan on themselves and eliminate the management structure of this company.
1,This software is useless,"I have a Macintosh G5 running OSX Panther. This software does not work with my machine. You cannot boot from the CD. None of the features are usable, optimization, wipe, etc. It was a complete waste of money.Please Note: Norton is no longer supporting the Macintosh OS and has gotten out of the Macintosh utilities software business."
5,the best,"This is the best antivirus and all-around computer maintainence software that I have ever used. It updates itself automatically, scans everything that goes into my computer and warns me when it finds something dangerous. I use this to keep my Mac safe. You should too."
4,Unscrambling Bosnian History,"To me this book, which focuses mostly on Medieval and Ottoman Bosnia, is a brilliant scholarly introduction to the rise and fall of Bosnia.The scope of the book includes Bosnia's interaction with Croatia, Serbia, and Slovenia and other countries of the Balkans, the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, including the rolls of Islam and Muslims.The Author's task was complicated by the fact that there are three versions of the history - the Bosnian version, the Croatian version, and the Serbian version - and all three are colored to some degree by oral traditions of Christian and Muslin experiences.It appears that the Author has gone to extraordinary efforts to assure an unbiased account of events and this will have to do until the potential facts can be viewed from 30,000 feet."
4,Arguably best popular history of Bosnia and Hercegovina,"Although by no means without bias, this is arguably the best popular history of Bosnia and Hercegovina on the market. It covers developments from the earliest times up to 1993. Malcom blames especially forces outside of Bosnia and Hercegovina for that country's destruction-in particular Serbia's leadership and the ""fatal interference of the leaders of the West."""
4,Good historical account,"Althought the author is not Bosnian the book tends to lean a little in favor of Muslims. I have yet to find a book that is completely unbiased on the matter though (every book seems to be pro Croats, Muslims or Serbs). However, it is a fairly clear account of how Bosnia came to be."
2,Uncomfortable Boots,"I don't like them, they are not comfortable. They are nice looking and I would wear them if it was only for a short time."
5,Very nice!!,"I read this whilst waiting for some Destroyer books I had ordered, and I found the book very entertaining, and yes, the villian is really, really creepy!!I liked it!"
3,Super Reader,"The Forever King is about the conflict over the Grail between the opposing forces of Arthur and Saladin. While that is all very well in the past, in the present setting of the book, Arthur has been reincarnated as a young boy and Saladin is a loony bin type of resident.Merlin is a constant, and the character of the ingenue, Nimue is here represented as being on the side of Arthur and the Grail."
3,"As another reviewer put it, ""Entertaining... fluff.""","Overall, a fun read--a bit on the predictable side but the characters were engaging. Good airport reading."
5,I waited for this one....,"I waited for this one to be available for my Kindle. This is easily my favorite Aurthurian series ( particularly the first two books ). My only disappointment is that the next two aren't out yet. Please hurry with the next one, Amazon. It is by far the best and I cannot wait to read it again since I lost my paperback copy...it was falling apart anyway."
1,Forverrrr Kingicus,"This book was an outrage! The letters were angry at me.....I tried to read them, but the people in my head wouldnt let me conentrate. I was so angry......I yelled at the voices once I got the chance. DARN THOSE VOICES. They wont stop talking to me! If they tell me one more water scuba diving story about the fish people, I will be extremely angry with the little munchkins. The VOICES THE VOICES THE VOICES THE VOICES THE VOICES! The angry voices. The world whe it ended two weeks ago, we happened to see the lights.....red blue green purple......Nobody knows how many people Ive seen since the end of the water.....nobody swims anymore."
2,Engaging take on Arthurian ledgend,"I read this series when it came out in paperback, and I purchased this before realizing the entire trilogy wasn't released in Kindle format. I would hold off purchasing this, and instead locate the series at your local used book store, or library.Why publish a single book in a completed trilogy, and why charge MORE then available paperback versions of it. It needs no distribution, no physical media, and publishing and editing costs were covered in the original run(s)."
2,dont know what to say,"Could not seem to get into reading this book, it really drug out so I put it aside! good luck getting started!"
3,Nice twist on the Camelot story,This book is part II of the King Arthur story. Taking place in present time. I'm still reading it but so far so good.
3,A little pricey,"I purchased this bottle to go with a 13"" water baby and it is the perfect size for that doll, including the fact that it fit perfectly in the baby's mouth. But...I found an almost identical bottle at a popular ""always a dollar"" store and they also had bottles with apple and orange juices in them. It is durable. I dropped it from about 4' onto a hardwood floor and it survived :)"
1,Don't Waste your Money,If Carlos Santana heard thess CD's he would probably sue for defamation of character.They sound absolutely nothing like Santana and his great band. DON'T waste your money.Too bad they can't be returned.
1,soooo disappointed,"This jacket is cut very small, so when ordering, keep in mind that large and extra large will still be small. There is no forgiveness in this jacket. Good luck. I was so disappointed with the results."
1,"Define ""mystery"" . . .","This book is not only rather dull, it's also mis-named. The disappearance of Amelia Earhart, the fate of Martin Bormann and the LADY BE GOOD, and the German motivation in shooting down Leslie Howard's plane are almost the only ""mysteries"" investigated. ""How close was Hitler to perfecting the atomic bomb?"" is an interesting sidelight on the war, but it's not a mystery, nor is the self-sinking of the submarine TANG in 1944. Many of the illustrations included are pure padding and have little or nothing to do with the subject under discussion, and because the author is a Brit, he stretches to include details of British involvement in events in which they were very peripheral."
1,Don't waste your time,"I found this book unreadable and in need of professional editing. The author continually references ""Your workbook"" which is not included. I found it annoying and of no value whatsoever. Save your money."
5,Fantastic Mounting Platform,"This is not the first Ram Mount product I own, and I can say that I've never been disappointed. The mounts are simple in design resulting in ease of operation, yet they are very sturdy. I really like how quickly the arm and platform attach and detach from the base. This lets me get my GPS / Fishfinder on and off of the Kayak quickly, saving time at the ramp / dock. If I had to suggest an improvement for the mount, then I'd wish for an integrated way to pass electrical wiring through the fixed mounting base. This would make for a cleaner looking installation on my kayak. I imagine that would make the base quite a lot larger though, and less universally applicable.Ram Mounts are one of only a few products / brands in which I will go out of my way to recommend to people."
2,ram-111 graph gps mount,this mount works ok the 2in base is really to small i got a hummming bird 998si graph and the whole mount wobbles real bad. base needs to be about 4 or more inches. the arm is made of cast aluminum mine broke while trying to tighten it other than that it worked ok.
2,Great While It Lasted,"We bought our camcorder in April '99 to take on our Alaskan cruise vacation. It makes wonderful recordings, but playback was initially a problem. I thought a syncronization problem was something I was doing. It became apparent when, 54 weeks after purchasing it, an SP and an LP recording we made couldn't be played back. The SP had no sound and intermittent video. The LP played back in SP.We sent it to JVC for repair and the estimate came back at 1/2 the original purchase price. I'm going to buy something else because they now cost about as much as the repair cost."
5,Worth it,"I purchased this camcorder shortly before our baby was born, and absolutely love it. It's a bit expensive, but so easy to use and handy that it was easily worth it for us. I used the accompanying software to capture the best frames as still photos, and then simply chose the ""save as HTML album"", and VOILA--I had a web site for the baby! There are plenty of more advanced features that I haven't had the time to experiment with yet, but it's good to know that they're there when I do get around to it. I couldn't be happier with my choice!"
1,A bootleg at half the price?,"This ""Greatest Hits"" compilation is currently being offered by two different distributors under separate titles, one ""44 Greatest Hits"" and the other ""Some Enchanted Evening"", but with one selling at almost half the price of the other and both albums exactly the same! All tracks appear to be bootleg versions not sourced from original recordings. The credibility of everyone is at stake with this apparent contradiction and Qualiton ( the higher priced distributor ) refuses comment! I wonder why?"
2,Leaky lid,"I was duped into buying this mug, thinking it had a leak-proof, or at least mostly non-leak lid. In fact, there are better lids on cheap plastic mugs I have used. Make sure you purchase the Nissan mug that specifically states that it is leak-proof, and has a 6-hour capacity (this one will keep beverages hot or cold for only 1-hour). One more thing... it smells funny."
3,Leaky lid,"I bought this mug as a gift. The person I gave it to was unhappy with it because it leaked when he carried it in his backpack. It is a nice looking, good quality mug, but for the price it really should have a better lid. The lid will probably work fine if you only intend to carry it in your hand or car cup holder."
4,"Sturdy, handy tumbler","I've had this cup for at least 5 years.Good points: Well balanced handle which feels go in my hand and allows me to carry empty by sticking the handle in my pocket. Easy to open and close to fill and to drink. You can peel the label off so you don't go around advertising.Weaknesses: Smell seemed to accumulate, particularly after I used it for chai tea. There's an internal gasket on the inside near the top which harbors gunk and smells. Top threads starting to strip, but I've had it for eons.I haven't found better yet, but I'm looking."
3,"Could be great, but ends up just OK","Pros: it will keep your drinks warm for hours even without preheating; will also keep your drinks inside the mug as long as you don't turn it horizontal. This mug is not totally leakproof so don't expect it to be. It really isn't too hard to clean, but I wouldn't put it in the dishwasher.Cons: It retains smells like crazy and they won't come out. Coffee flavored tea anyone? The white gasket inside does collect gunk and is responsable for the smell. The cap, while ok, could be designed a lot better and feels cheap and plasticy.If you want a mug that keeps your drink warm for a few hours and aren't afraid of cleaning it out by hand every time you use it, then this should work fine. Don't expect much else though."
2,Not WARM at all (even with preheating!),"I have always heard GREAT things about Nissan products (or maybe I assumed they were great because they are more expensive than even Starbucks products). However, I am very disappointed with this products. It doesn't keep the liquids hot, even after I preheat it with HOT water. Sad, but true. Also, the lid leaks. Save your money and buy any other kind of insulated mug. This is not worth the money."
3,Pretty Good Product,"Pro: I bought this for my wife because she wanted a mug to keep her coffee warm for hours and because it looked more heavy-duty than the cheap one I have. This product does this well. The stainless shell is fine and should last.Con: The lid is flimsy and a little awkward to drink around. As far as cleaning, it could be a better design - make it a welded all-stainless cup with no sealing ring! But I agree with another who said that a tiny amount of dishwasher detergent and some hot water will go a long way toward keeping it clean.Summary: A little pricey, could be a better design, but my wife loves it!"
5,Excellant cutters,Great set of star cutters with a nice range in sizes. I used the cutters to make American Girl stars for a cake order. They are sturdy and a nice addition to my Ateco cutter collection.
4,"fun stars, nest nicely","The gradated shapes are exactly what I needed for craft classes. We used them for needle felting shapes for accessories and the sharp side was still ok for flipping over to felt the other side safely. I also plan to use them as templates, drawing, and maybe even cookies. The accompanying tin is perfect for storage (although a clear lid would have been nice to see at a glance what was inside), and they nest nicely, making it easy to identify any missing pieces."
5,Star Cookie Cutter,I used this for making pastry hors d'oeuvres for the Christmas holiday. It was the perfect shape for the season.
4,Useful book,"This was a good addition to my collection with a number of patterns from different eras. I would have liked a value, though."
4,"Good, but not what I expected.","The book is in great condition! The problem was my mistake. I thought it was going to give me actual prices for evaluating some pieces I have. It's a great book, just not exactly what I was looking for."
3,Florence's Glassware Pattern Identification Guide ValumeII,"This book shows the detail of the items well, the only thing about it that i did not like was that it did not give an estimated value of the pieces shown, I am researching items left to me by my mother and need to know approximately what they are worth before I sell them."
4,"Good, though not Great","I bought this Cars toy for my 22-month old son at a regular toy store a couple of months ago (he is big into Cars and so are we), though, surprisingly, he never really took as much a liking to it as the smaller, regular, Cars. I've come to think that I like it more than he does... 3.5 Stars"
4,This book is very useful and entertaining.,"This book is very useful for any project that has to do with Greek mythology. It is wonderfully illistrated, and has good information."
1,very bad experience,I bought this product and found that it is defective very quickly. It has 2 band of FM transmission frequencies but only the low band frequency working. I tried to email the frOObi Customer Support twice about the problem but there is no response at all until today after amost 2 weeks.Keep away from this product and from frOObi.
5,World class jazz played by all time greats,"What an incredible concert this is! Every musician that was involved in this concert is a virtuoso on his chosen instrument. Talk about an all star lineup. Being a tremendous admirer of the music produced by Creed Taylor on his CTI/Kudu label, I'll admit that I'm biased. But if you're a CTI/Kudu fan, this is an absolute must. There are so many highlights on here that it's hard to choose among so many great moments. But for me, the tracks that really stand out are ""Red Clay,"" ""It's Too Late,"" ""Leaving West"" and ""Straight Life."" The emcee for this concert sounds like a complete idiot. There are times when he actually starts yelling into his microphone as the musicians are playing! Despite that annoying flaw, this is truly great jazz played by incredible musicians. Very highly recommended!"
5,Absolutely recommend,"This book has guided myself and my loved ones to a healthier and more meaningful life. Dr. Servan-Schreiber provides hope, information and sound research to help one manage their own 'terrain' for a more meaningful and healthier life. Many thanks to Dr. Servan- Schreiber for sharing his story and research with the world."
3,Simple and easy,For the price- this is a great item for the amateur baker who wants to make that baked good a little extra special. My only complaint: it is recommended that the plastic pastry bags be cut 1 1/2 inches from the bottom to fit the metal piping pieces. This is too much-- the icing leaked out of the bottom. Otherwise- it is simple and easy to use. If one is feeling very environmentally conscious-- you can wash and re-use the plastic bags.
2,Only a companion to baroque organs and uneven.,"Those who are used to the Oxford series of ""Companions"" will be surprised to find this Cambridge Companion is not an encyclopedic reference book. It is a collection of articles on a broad range of topics--construction, esthetics, performance technique and the repertoire--with a very uneven level. Some articles address the basics (sit up straight while you are playing) while others assume that you know everything already (off hand references to organs you should know about.) Almost all the organs discussed in any depth are the German-Dutch baroque instruments and their modern replicas, with just a few words on large romantic instruments. In sum, it may be an interesting ""read"" for the connoisseur, but it isn't very useful as a reference for the interested amateur."
5,Best Wolfe book - no bull,"Put Nero Wolfe in the cornfield and watch the comedy and mystery erupt. Wisecracking Archie flirts with the girls while Nero uses his wits to solve two murders and the mystery of a prize winning bull. I loved this book - one of the best and most intriguing mysteries ever! And it also had excellent comedy value. The ending was just, and Nero came up with several impressive conclusions along the way. You must read this classic!"
1,Style over substance..........,"Very pretty to look at, but, boring to watch. The choreography lacked variety and was repetitive. There was little diversity in the ages of the dancers or of body type. Even the tribal bellydancers, who are usually very distinct, blended into the general melee.I only recommend it if you can catch it on PBS for free."
5,Enchanting!,"Bellydance Superstars: Live From Shanghai is a live performance DVD featuring the world's greatest bellydancers. Accompanying by master percussionist Issam Houshan, the bellydancers put on a show like no other. My personal favourites was the Ballet D'Orient and the South Pacific Bellynesian segments of the DVD. Sonia, Sabah, Colleen and the rest of the bellydancers spared no effort in entertaining the audience in this installment of the BDSS collection. I enjoy this DVD as much I enjoyed the other BDSS editions. I'll look forward to more exciting Bellydance Superstars DVD titles in the near future."
3,not their best,"I have few of their Performance DVD's, this one was not that great. It had a very student show feel to it. The movements though lovely as always seem mechanical and very few of the dancers seem to be there in anything other then body, over all it's boring and disappointing.Live from Pairs and Babelesque are much better."
1,disappointment,With any kind of wind this cover lifts off the car. Don't waste your money and put out alittle extra for a custom cover.
2,Hyundai Accent,"Does not completely fit our 2009 Accent its a little short in the front end,only comes down to the middle of the front bumper,everwhere else it fits like a glove.."
5,"Very, Very Funny","this book is funny, I couldn't stop laughing ALL DAY one joke said ""Carl: What's that you have in your buttonhole? Earl:Why that's a chrysanthemum. Carl: It looks like a rose to me. Earl: Nope, your wrong it's a chrysanthemum. Carl spell it. Earl:K-r-i-s... by golly, that is a rose."" over all i recommend this book."
5,Excellent; too bad it's apparently hard to get in the States,"This is the second book on Zope 3 to be published, and where Stephan Richter's book is designed to be more of a cookbook, this is a polished and impressive presentation of the Zope 3 software that will suit many better as a first text. The index leaves a bit to be desired, but it is otherwise an excellent effort.Springer, the publisher, is a very well respected German publisher; it's really too bad for us Americans that the high price and slow delivery times for this book associated with overseas shipping may deter purchase: it should be a first choice for an introduction."
3,No Documentation,"I am very disappointed in the packaging and the lack of documentation. They should have included the track listings and any documentation that has been included in the individual DVD packaging. I was especially disappointed that on the Royal Albert Hall performances where there is no listing of the songs, which show they are from and who is performing them. I was hoping to find a track listing here at Amazon but I have not found one yet."
3,Very poor sound quality for Joseph,"My kids (and I) like Joseph and Technicolor Dreamcoat. It's very visually stimulating/captivating (bright vivid bold colors), lots of dancing, lots of singing and catchy tunes. However we turn the sound up when the brothers are singing; Joseph and the narrator lady come across loud and clear - just the brothers seem too low/soft."
4,Only the Best,My wife and I disagree over Webber's work. I find most of his songs mediocre but agree every show has a couple of outstanding songs. This CD allows us to only listen to the songs we like best.
4,Good set,Good headset for the price. Nice range and it come with batteries. Rechargeable ones at that! Just danced the night away under the aurora 500 feet from the base and never so much as a crackle or hiss.Only negative I've seen so far is the headset is a little tight.Not unusual for me with a size 8 head!You're gonna love this well made outfit.
3,Drawback When Used With A PC,"Good sound, excellent battery system, and outstanding range with minimal interference. All solid positives when used for music broadcast. However, when using these headphones with a computer, I find they go out of tune during periods where the computer is not putting out any sound signal. So, unless you keep a steady soundtrack playing, you will get an unpleasant ""whoooosh"" of static, and have to recalibrate the tuning wheel following a period of silence. Not good for games without an omnipresent soundtrack. I now use an IR headset with the computer, and save this set for roaming the house while listening to music."
2,Might be worthwhile if you can get a good deal.,"I chose this model because of the good reviews of it here on Amazon.com. I do not think so highly of this model as others. There is a constant hissing sound that I could not ignore. The music was always louder out of one ear than the other. I only used the phones once and I was only two feet from the stereo. I could not stand them any longer.These faults may not bother some people as much as it does me. Even though I paid only $11 for the set, I'd rather crank up my stereo and bother the neighbors than try to listen to music with these things."
2,Poorly remastered music,When I purchased this CD I mistakenly thought this was going to be BB and Santana TOGETHER. It turned out there are two seperate CDs. No problem. Unfortunately the extremely poor quality of remastered recordings made this purchase a bust. A shame considering the obvious talent of the two ledgendary artists. Live and learn.
4,Smashing,"An attempt to describe this disc would be; abstract dissonant prog-metal played by some clever blokes who create unique songs that have varied moods and intricate changes. Anti-Depressive Delivery have their own sound and groove that is refreshing. The first time I heard this I was a little surprised, elated and amused all at once. After repeated listens, it just gets better. Hard to believe this is a debut release and with any luck, they will be around for a while."
1,Not worth the price and not what I remembered!,"This was a big disappointment for me. I had long wanted to once again enjoy the ""energy sticks"" I remembered from my childhood, so I added one of these on to an order. Not only was it not the same format I had as a child (we had something about the diameter of a regular tootsie roll, and about 6"" long, whereas this was about 3 to 4 times that diameter and could be broken into 4 sections), but it did NOT have the same taste at all. I know we sometimes inflate the wonderfulness of things in our memories, but this was definitely not the same thing we had as children. I'm not sure if this is just a different thing altogether, or if this is a poor remake of that, but I was very disappointed. It didn't taste horrible, but it sort of tasted like it had had itself been around since the 70s and was similar to any high-protein bar around -- definitely NOT worth the price!"
1,Not happy with my space stickS,I was under the impression that STICKS was plural. I would not have paid $12 for one space STICK.Thank You Very Much
2,Smaller than,I purchased these thinking they were going to be a bit larger in size but alas they were not. now to figure out what to do with them. :-(
3,nissan coffee mug,"keeps coffee warm. nice size container. one problem, when washing the cap peels off something. unable to figure iout what it is. I wash it thoroughly to no results."
4,Cleaning Secret,"I've been using two of these for 5 years. Like others, I've noticed that the main seal on the body and the rim seal in the screw-on lid collect germs that start to smell.The secret to removing the rim and exposing the main body seal:Unscrew the top.Place the bottom corner of the rim against a sharp corner, insert a hammer handle (the wooden part only!) into the cup and tap sharply down. Turn it 180 and tap again. This should pop off the rim, revealing the silicone seal.I soak both the rim and lid seals in hot water with some bleach and scrub them with a toothbrush.To reassemble, wipe a little vaseline on the bump formed into the tumbler body, Reassemble the rim and seal, and set it upside down on the counter. A couple of taps from the side of the hammer handle should pop it all back together.Now they stay nice and fresh.Regards"
5,Love the lid mechanism!,"Simply the best mug I've ever had! The lid mechanism is only open when you push it, so your beverage will always be warm, unlike many other tumblers that lose heat rapidly. Definitely a must have!"
5,BEST MUG EVER,"This mug is the best I've ever found. It has the longest heat retention. The no spill lever is great and keeps more heat in. When was the last time you remembered to close the lid on other mug types before you knocked it over? Worried about bacteria!!- well wash it in soap for 30 seconds. I use the lever to hook into my belt loop or fanny pack strap, when I need a free hand; and it won't spill because the action of hanging by the lever keeps it tightly closed. it does'nt need a handle. I was racking my brain when I lost it, couldn't find it anywhere in retail stores. Hail the all powerfull search engines.I'm buying 2 more. PS fitting the lid to the 18oz version is a great idea."
5,Great Coffee Cup!,"This cup was purchased for my husband who is a full time coffee drinker. He has used Nissan Thermos Travel Tumblers for years and was devastated when he lost the one like this with the handle. He likes the ease of drinking coffee with it while on the move, and that he can hook it on the back of his belt and keep both hands free. It maintains HOT coffee for hours, is very sturdy and won't break when dropped. It is hard to find this particular design in local stores, so we were delighted to find it on Amazon.com"
3,Not terrible/Not great,"- Not spill proof, but did not leak around sides.- Keeps drink hot/cold for about an hour, then declines.- Difficult to clean around lip at top, noticeable smell after a while.Overall:If it is heat/cold retention you are looking for, you could probably do better with a thermos. If it is a coffee mug, I would want something a little easier to handle."
5,"Incredible, Indestructible Mug","I work for a small town municipal authority as a water system operator and spend most of my days outdoors where the quality of this tumbler has really shined. I used to buy cheap tumblers that would only keep coffee hot for an hour or so, not the four hours I usually get from this one, and the others were constantly drenching me when the 'no spill' lid would pop off. I bought my first Nissan four years ago and still have never found anything better. My original mug has been dropped off of trucks, run over, frozen solid, banged, dented etc. etc. and it still works as well as the day I bought it. Granted after four years the handle broke and I have to push the button but the money I paid for this tumbler would have been spent many times over on replacing inferior models. This product is a lifesaver when I'm working in cold conditions and worth every penny!"
3,"The Good, and the Ugly","I'm a big fan of Nissan thermos products. I've owned a plethora of mugs and canisters over the years and all of them can really keep your drinks hot for hours which I love. This travel tumbler works as advertised and if you are in the market for one I'll give it a thumbs up.The buyer beware side of this, and it really extends with a lot of mugs, is to beware the funk. The funk is what can develop if you are not good about cleaning your tumbler. The funk will develop in little hidden crevices in the details. Underneath the lid where the mechanics work can develop some very scary alien slime. It's all easily avoidable by knowing it can happen. Take care of your tumbler and you'll never be scared. Don't and I guarantee the first time you see what I'm talking about you might just freak out."
5,My fourth one! I love this thing.,"This is my fourth purchase of this mug.I'm buying it for my wife, as she keeps losing them.I have my original, still, and its the best one I've ever owned. It keeps coffee drinkable-hot for over 3 hours. The dual valve feature keeps your drink incredibly hot.My only caution would be to keep the top clean, as with use of real cream there are some nooks and crannys in the lid mechanism that can get pretty nasty if you use real cream... I'm still alive, though, and I usually just rinse my cup out each morning...Highly recommended."
5,Can't say enough good things about this mug.,"Like I said - I can't say enough good things about this mug. Keeps thintgs hot for hours through the commute into the mid morning at my desk. While the lever cover will not prevent a leak should you turn it over, the seal does prevent wholesale coffee over everything. Yes, you've got to wash it and use a brush occationally. But, this is likely the last mug you'll ever need. Cheers - Eric Steinmetz"
1,Bacteria grow in the rim,"This mug is great... for one week only. My first mug lasted for a month, then it got so stinky, I had to send it back to The Thermos Company. They sent me another one, which I was *extremely* careful to clean and dry after use. Even so, in three weeks I gave up on it too. The Thermos Company won't return money, but I just want them to smell the mug they made. I think they should recall this lousy product because its design is flawed and the stuff that grows in the rim may poison you.P.S. It also leaks like crazy when tilted."
5,Nissan Thermos,This is the third Nissan for my husband. He will drink his coffee out of nothing else. It keeps the coffee hot for hours!! the handle makes is easy to use and keeps anything from spilling if knocked over. It you are looking for a sturdy thermos to keep your coffee hot this is the one!
5,Replacement mug,"I had the same Nissan tumbler for years but needed a replacement due to an 'accident' with the old one. Excellent tumbler, glad to get the new one - looks just the same."
2,not worth the money,"The only reason I rate this item so low, is because of the value, or lack thereof. It is a nice coffee cup, fits well in the car, comfortable to hold and the top is secure. It's just not worth $... I poured my cup an hour ago, and it is luke warm right now. Also, it is not spill proof."
5,Thermos Nissan,"This thermos is excellent. It keeps things hot and cold for many hours. it is a nicely designed thermos. I think it is a little ""pricey""."
2,Don't waste your money,"This mug is not worth $5 much less the current price listed. It insulates well, but not noticeably better than more commonly available mugs. I was expecting the mug's lever to make a leak-free seal. However, I've found that it only resists leaks when *slightly* jostled. If you hold it upside-down, a steady-stream of liquid emerges for several seconds-it does stop, but the stream will return after righting the mug and re-tipping. Coffee leaves a distinct smell even after hand-washing. So, if you are looking for a mug that doesn't leak and can be washed in the dishwasher, continue looking!"
2,They forgot to insulate the lid!,"Although the sides are well-insulated with vacuum/mirror technology, that doesn't help much when the lid is plain plastic...and not very thick at that. (It's like having the best quality insulation in the walls of your home, but leaving the front door wide open!) This fault is clearly evident by just feeling the exterior of the tumbler when it is filled with hot liquid (coffee): the sides are cool to the touch, but the top third of the tumbler gets hot. I returned mine because of this design flaw. On the positive side: it is an attractive tumbler, its size is perfect for auto travel, and I liked the feature to open a convenient drinking port with a lever. However, my nose hit the lid with every sip. Thermos/Nissan needs to realize there is a HUGE market for a decent vacuum tumbler, and stop cutting corners. Do some market research, guys!"
2,Spills Constantly!,"This thermos keeps drinks hot for a long time, as promised. However, I am getting really tired of cleaning up spills from the item--maybe I have a deffective cap, but everytime it merely tilts it spills something else. I got the thermos because I am tired of coffee mugs that spill when I am on the go, and I was enticed by the ""spill-proof"" nature of the thermos. But it's worse than my old, ten dollar thermos form Coffee Bean in terms of spills."
5,Great Mug,"Simple, Sleek, Easy to Clean, No Spill Worries, and keeps my beverage warm for 4-5 hours (cold for about 8).It does dribble a bit out of the hole in the top if it is completely upside down, but I mean, come on, really. . . it's pretty much perfect."
4,Great travel mug.,"This is the best travel mug i have ever used, its stainless on the inside, there is a rubber ""o"" ring that seals very well on the lid.Also it fits perfectly in a Colman 5272 cooler right in a recess in the lid.The lever is nice because it only opens while you are drinking, so if some dirt falls on the lid you can just wash of the top of the cup and continue with your hot coffee. I only gave it 4 stars becaue i generally dont read 5 star reviews."
5,Nissan Travel thermos,This travel thermos is the best. It keeps coffee hot for hours. It's easy to use while driving and doesn't leak. I wouldn't have any other brand.
4,traditional production of the Swan Lake from the Kirov,"First class dancers, costumes and settings from the Kirov Company. Prima Ballerina Galina Mezentseva is very good in showing the contrast of the characters in the dual role Odile/Odette. I rather recommend ""Giselle"" from the same couple in which she excells in the dramatic interpretation of the role. She gives the best Giselle performance (both dramatically and technically) and one can even see the tears in her eyes in the Mad Scene. (I don't know whether this video is available from amazon.com)."
3,Daley's review in a wrong place,"The review by Aleta M. Daley (dated Jan. 9, 2003) is misplaced.It is for a different version of Kirov's Swan Lake."
5,Fresh new artist finds himself and you along the way...,"The songs in this collection come straight from the heart. Marcus has walked the road many of us have walked, though we might have not known how to express the deep feelings we had at that time in our lives. He is the voice of the everyday ... man. We can all identify with his joys and sorrows. Heavenly Love is one song that really speaks to me; I can tell Marcus has known the feelings I've felt. To me, this CD is a wonderful collection of joy, pain, laughter, fond memories, and hope for the future. A great effort for his first release...I look forward to hearing more from him!"
5,Duro -Med urinal,"This urinal is well worth the price. $10.25 Very durable Has large opening, unlike other urinals which has a very narrow openings."
3,better fhan the last one,"...but still won't prevent spills if upset when fully closed. Also the closed bottle takes a lot of strength and dexterity to open. Also challenging to close it. If you didn't hear two distinct ""snap""s it ain""t."
5,Home health products,"I purchased a Urinal from my local medical suppliar for close to three times the price Amazon's cost. Amazon's is truly high quality, and, it's made in America! The one from the medical suppliar is real-junk, made in China! I returned it and showed them Amazon's. I think they might buy from Amazon now. yuk-yuk.....I promptly ordered another one. I never considered Amazon would sell Urinals. The more we search, the more we find!"
2,Leaks,Lid does not seal it closed tightly.Bought it for my father in law and he has a hard time trying to get lid snapped on all the way and even when he does it still leaks if it falls over.
1,They switched models !,"I ordered an Urinal from these guys about two weeks ago and it was just right. So I ordered another one but they sent a different, poorly designed model.I liked the first one not the second. Be careful with these people.The second one I received is not the one shown. A rip off. It has a hollow handle which is opened so that urine gets it to the handle and stinks. I real mess."
3,Haven't Faded Away Just Yet.,"I'm suprised, I never would have thought that out of all songs on METEORA, this would be the newest single. I'm suprised that it actually works for me. It's great.Anyways, this cds okay but in my opinion to late. This would have really boosted the album if it was released in earlier promoting.As for the live recording and video:Runaway's a fun song but the live version could of been better. I watched them play this live on there last tour date with Metallica in San Francisco.The video of Faint is a huge build with an explosion at the end but not much to look at. In order to really enjoy it you need it big and loud. Wait for the DVD."
5,The poems of The Ardors are stunning,"Line upon line, gorgeous. Masterfully employing an extended metaphor of pearls, Peirce honors the intensity, mystery, and beauty of earth, and of experience. She observes worlds mindfully, so that her poems move between large and small, under and over, internal and external. This movement complements her brilliant and measured phrasing. The poems accumulate, like pearls, to form an exquisite book of American poetry."
1,Snooze Fest,"Mr. Bicheno seems rather impressed with his collection of facts and tidbits which he manages to jumble together in the most incoherent fashion.I did not expect this work to be a running screed against Catholicism and Western Civilization in general. As an Ottoman apologist supreme, Mr. Bicheno continuously points out the shortcomings of Christendom, while ignoring the entire point of the necessity for this great Battle - Islamic Jihad!Is it really too much to ask what the Ottomans/Muslims were doing penetrating into Greece and Europe in the first place? For a much better discussion of this topic, please see ""The Legacy of Jihad"" by Andrew Bostom."
4,Is white a color?,"I was taught in art class that red, blue, yellow, for example were colors, but white and black weren't. Well, I guess with that in mind, I was surprised that over 50% of the mixed colored golf balls were white. I was hoping for a lot more colored balls.They are good quality, just wanted more color."
2,too many white,"got for colored balls to hand out as prizes to young folks. Over half of ""colored"" balls were white and not usable as prizes"
4,Crystal Mixed Colors Recycled Golf Balls,"I love the crystals and they are in great shape for recycled balls. I'm getting great distance with them. My only complaint....too many white, off white golf balls. Really love the colors."
3,A highly restricted and narrow view of probability,"The title of this book is somewhat misleading.A more appropriate title would have been""The Probabilistic Foundations of Modern Physics:A Historical,Mathematical and Philosophical Perspective (with an appendix on Bruno de Finetti)"".von Plato takes a very narrow view of what ""Modern"" probability is.Essentially,it is the approach of some one like R. von Mises's place selection criteria supplemented and/or replaced by de Finetti's exchangeability criteria for dealing with a series or sequence of events.J M Keynes is mentioned three times in throwaway sentences.R Carnap gets a couple of throwaway sentences.Interval estimates and/or indeterminate or imprecise probabilities are not covered in this book.In conclusion,the title is a misnomer."
2,Not what I remember,"This animal sound maker is a lot smaller than I remember from when I was a child. The reason could be that I'm bigger, but I don't think so. The sound it makes is very tiny and doesn't really sound like a cow. I bought it for my 2 1/2 year old grandson and he has no interest in it. Even though it wasn't an expensive item, I feel it was a waste of money."
2,another trendy very very lite book on networking,"I did not buy into the authors concept of NetWorlding. I was looking for a book that was more practical - their approach is very administrative full of trendy verbiage, like the title -'NetWorlding'. To really understand networking you need to understand politics - the best networkers are usually politically astute. Check out 'The Secret Handshake' by Kathleen Kelley Reardon. It has a much deeper and useful treatment of how to build and manage usable connections.That's my take - loopster - Chicago, IL"
4,Interesting ideas. . .,"There are a lot of networking books out there, and many of them focus on the idea ""You should network, because then you can meet people and maybe eventually they can do something for you."" This is a bit different. The ""Networlding"" concept is that by building relationships with people with whom you share values and interests, eventually you can build that into a quality business relationship, but you have to be patient and realize that trust does not come overnight. Overall, this is a very interesting spin on taking the old-school style of networking and building it into something that can be values-based and modern."
2,"Lots of talk, very little actionable ideas","This book is full of grand stories, but I didn't find a lot of actionable ideas for my own life. I found it a struggle to finish reading the book. I would not recommend it to anyone."
5,A rewarding approach to relationships,"The authors have penned an approach to networking that is both systematic and powerful. Built on a base of shared values, Networlding is an exceptional guide for getting the most out of relationships. For everyone looking to succeed by doing good, this is a must read."
4,It's not what you know...,"Networlding is an entertaining read and a great place to start in thinking about building your network. If you want more than a list of 10,000 Twitter followers talking about what they had for breakfast, it's going to take some work in finding the right ones, establishing your common interests and building trust. Melissa and Jocelyn have done a nice job of making this into a structured plan while keeping it fun."
3,Connection problem,It's only a week old when it couldn't make a connection to other tamagotchi anymore. Hope the company make a better quality of it since this isn't cheap to only last a week or couple months.
2,Poor book quality but the seller response to the complaint,"I ordered a used book marked with ""acceptable condition"", but when I received it, the book is broken in the middle along the join and taped together with plastic tape. I was disppointed with this surprise and send a complaint to the seller. They offered to return the book and get refund, but I have no time to order another one, so I accept discount and keep the book.Another hurdle is the delivery time, I was informed (after paid) that the book will arrive in 6 weeks. I asked for quicker delivery, but they just say sorry. Actually, the book arrived after 10 working days from the ordering."
4,"Fun, in that weird sort of way","First of all, this is NOT a soundtrack, as far as I can tell, it's just the name of the album. Baleen draws from millions of inspirations, and their songs are very varied and eclectic. They even do a spacey, tripped out version of the Moonlight Sonata! Some rock, some funk, some electronics/ambient, etc. If you like crazy, hard-to-categorize music, try out Baleen."
4,Worth Checking Out,Good cd. Got copy in mail the other day and have been playing it non-stop. Worth the buy! Check these guys out!
1,forget this!!,"Uncomfortable to wear. The band that holds it on your face is clearly visible no matter how much you try to hide it. It was suppose to be black like the pic, but I got a red beard instead. Dont waste your time."
4,Be prepared to spend time figuring out stuff on your own,"First of all, the book will take novices like me, to another level. It will show you some really cool shadowing and effects etc... But...., be prepared to really get mad and look through Photoshop's help section to figure out what the author just said and how to do it. I had read one book before this on Photoshop, but when I started reading Jeff's book, I HAD to learn to figure out how to find the info I didn't understand. Saying that, I would recommend this book to anyone that loves to create art and that HAS patience. I completed this book, understanding about 98% of it all. But not with out alot of headaches=/. Though, when I did get done, what a feeling! You WILL get alot of confidence in Photoshop if you do finish the book."
1,Wrong item sent,"I would not know about my last purchase because I was sent the wrong item. The purchase order in the box was correct but, the item was wrong. Then, my hausband threw out the box, not knowing I got the wrong thing. So, I am stuck with the cast iron preseasoned 14"" Joyce Chen Wok of which I had never even seen until I opened my box. The whole point was that I wanted the lid and wood handles. Didn't get either one. I looked up sending it back but, it really seemed too much trouble and then of course, my husband had tossed the box without me knowing. So, not real happy. I ordered the wok in the picture with the clear lid and wooden handles. I don't know why I got the cast iron wok. The picture that came along with your message asking me to do this review is what I ordered, not what you sent me. Don't know if I will be doing anymore shopping with results like this."
1,Personal Map Set Review,"I was very disappointed in what I got-only 3 usable transparencies in the whole ""set"". I wouldn't recommend buying it and I hesitate in purchasing the 22 map set."
4,WONDERUL FILM!,"I saw this film on HBO, or Showtime...one of those channels and thought it was just the sweetest film.Alex Linz is just too adorable and is a wonderful actor. He plays a young boy who wears dresses, but to him they are ""holy vestments"". His mother, a flamboyant 450 pound woman nursing a broken heart, is loving and understanding. His grandmother, played by a VERY manly Shirley Maclaine,who also directed this film, thinks both son and mother are crazy. She soon falls under the boys charms and encourages him the way she never did with her own son, the boys wayward father, played by Sinese, in a very small but important role.I love the performances in this movie. It seems that the actors are having a wonderful time and it comes across in their acting. The characters are very real and genuine. It is a bit ""Afterschool Special""ish, but the strong cast and performances carry it home."
2,"Positive message, but...","I would like to make it clear that I approve of this film's message. Children should be encouraged, or at least allowed, to express themselves in unconventional ways. I agree with Robert Bly's observation that those parts of ourselves that we suppress by ""putting them in a bag"" will become more primitive and dangerous. If we don't allow the boy to wear a dress when he's eight, he might grow up to become the ""Buffalo Bill"" character in ""Silence of the Lambs.""Unfortunately, the other characters, almost without exception, embody the crassest stereotypes. Especially galling is the character of the boy's mother, who on at least three occasions, is shown ordering or eating enormous amounts of food, and at one point, actually has a heart attack. It would have been far more interesting had Joey Lauren Adams played the boy's mother, with Gary Sinise abandoning her for the other actress. But that would have required real unconventional thinking."
4,A Small Charmer,"This film was a very pleasant surprise. Not having seen it, I purchased it on the strength of its cast. The film's success rests on the small shoulders of its lead character. Alex D. Linz proves, as he did in HOME ALONE 3, to be an absolutely charming presence. The scene in which he explains his lack of fear of dying to his grandmother is a gem. The film itself is a little unsteady at the beginning and, at 108 minutes, is a bit overlong, but, once it gets going, the story is filled with wonderful, quirky characters. It bears a passing resemblence to the Belgian film MA VIE EN ROSE (""My Life in Pink""), which is also recommended viewing."
4,A great movie to watch for people who have weight issues,I really enjoyed this one because it dealt with weight issues and how it effects child rearing and marriages. I really felt for the leading lady and also for the child caught up in it all.
1,Why would anyone sell a printer like this!!!,"It's advertised speed is a scam...This thing is slooooow. Worst yet, after about three months I get the infamous Error 41. Please save your money and invest in an all-in-one with a better reputation. This thing will interrupt your business."
2,Good but not without some annoying quirks,"I purchased this machine to serve as a fax and color printer. The fax capabilities are first rate, and if only used as a fax it gets 5 stars. The scanning is good, ackward, but good, and I used it a little for my kid's stuff, so that was ok.The printing is fast and looks good. The quality is very good even on draft! My issues with this thing starts here. I replaced all the cartridges early November. If it says its out of ink, it won't print, or fax, or scan, or anything! Now it is January, and again it says all the colored ink is low, all at once! One (1) (uno) page of color was printed from this thing the whole time with these cartridges. Everything else was fax printout (black). How could it be empty! And when it says it is totally empty, it is nothing but a paper weight then.My recommendation...look elsewhere, this is the 2nd brother I have owned, and it is my last!"
1,Horrible Investment,"Dont buy this printer, thats the bottom line. You will spend a huge amount of money on Ink even though you dont use the thing and futher more there is ""Machine Error 41"", just google that phrase to see how many people have the same problem.STAY WELL AWAY!"
3,It was a good AIO,"I actually was enjoying this printer when I first got it, as it did everything that I needed just fine, but then I began to notice things.This thing would test the print head at all kinds of time, which caused the machine to use the ink. After going through a number of ink carts., I asked a guy in an ink store about using refill kits. He said that the brother ink carts become very unreliable with them. I picked one up elsewhere for a cheap price that said that it would work, and sure enough I found the refill kit to be a waste of time and money.After going through I number of carts., I put one in one day and got an error 41. Did a little research on the internet, and it turns out to be a very common problem for this model.I am now in the process of looking for a new printer, but before I buy one, I am going to do my research.If you really want to get this model, try and find a refurb., and maybe it will be one that has had the error 41 fixed."
1,The worst printer EVER,I have had 3 replacements on this printer and now it is in the shop for an error 41. I saw 8 other printers just like mine in the shop when I dropped it off. Every other printer Brother sent out ended up in an error 41. This is a common problem for this model. I'll never buy another Brother Printer. Plus you spend 60.00 on ink DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER
1,Worthless don't purchase,"This is the second machine in one year the first one quit feeding paper after 2 months and now its a year later on a second machine and it has the same issue. Even worse it is an inkaholic. This thing drinks ink and we hardly use it, its bacause it cleans it self habitually weather u use it or not. I will never buy another brother product, they design thier machines to be a ink cash cow for them."
1,Don't buy it!,"This is a pile of junk. It uses more ink in cleaning itself than it uses printing. The print quality is poor. It jams paper. The only way to stop it from cleaning itself is to uplug it. The LCD display defies logic. I am donating it to charity so I can get a tax deduction so I can purchase another brand of copier. ""O Brother"" did I ever make a mistake in buying this MFC."
1,Very bad All in One,"My machine started giving me the Error 41 message last week and I've had the machine for 6 months. I agree with everyone about the self cleaning, eating up tons of ink and the flimsy unit."
1,Huge disappointment,"I own(ed) this printer, and have had problems from the beginning. I wish that I had taken it back right after I brought it home. The paper jams regularly. It sucks up ink, which is very very expensive to replace. It beeps around giving me commands to open and close the cover for no apparent reason. Most recently, it gave me the fatal error 41. Other than the fact that I just replenished it's ink supply, I am more than happy to replace it. My advice...don't buy Brother."
1,"Printer works ok, but it is a scam.","This unit prints with ok quality, has a decent scanner, and of course, can send and receive faxes. However, it will consume ink at a rate that will make you replace it almost monthly (even if you don't use it), and hold you hostage until you do. This is all do to a cleaning process that uses more ink than printing.The worst part is, even if a color, say blue, is out. You cannot print in any color, not even black, until the color is replaced.This thing is designed to consume ink and force you to buy it. As most people know these days, where companies make their money is in the ink (which is upwards of $[...] per cartridge).Go figure."
1,Frustrated out-of-ink user,"We have an MFC-3820 like 3420 which may be junked soon.Got mislead by the first few happy customers. But it is not reallytheir fault since you would not know how fast this printerdrinks up ink when you first bought it. I wish we would have waiteda little longer but thought we got a good deal. The money and timespent on the ink is definitely much more than getting one from HPor Canon. We could not believe a brand name like Brother willcontinue making junks like this (apparently 3420 and 3820 andwho knows some other models). This will be our last Brother, too."
1,total piece of monkey crap!!!!,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP. At first the stupid thing would clean the ribbons on me at 2am in the morning EVERY MORNING!! the on/off buttons dont work for squat. a few weeks later after barely a few usues, it stops working telling me my ink is out! i replaced the ink and it still aint working telling me a message to please open the cover endlessly!!!i tried to contact Brother customer service and was on hold for 30 minutes with no live person in sight---THIS PRODUCT IS THE WORST SCAM GARBAGE PIECE OF CRAP ON THE MARKET AND BROTHER SUPPORT IS NON EXISTENT------"
2,Won't stand the test of Time.,"I purchased my Brother MFC 3420c 3 years ago. First let me say that I'm not a heavy user I run about 5000 pages through the machine per year and for the first year or 2 ; I was pleased with its ease of setup and its functions. Initially I had very few problems not with standing the occasional pager jam. . After this initial break in period my 3420C found it way to the shop, fortunately Brother had extended the warranty for the parts that were broken until the 3420C hit its 3 year. When Error 41 appeared on the screen (unplug and call Brother). From my understanding from the repair shop, Error 41 means the printer head needs to be replaced, which now is NOT under warranty. Labor $60.00, part $69.00 plus tax. I suspect some will feel 3 years for a reality inexpensive multifunction machine is okay but not me I expected to get a lot more use from this machine. I didn't purchase another Brother to replace it."
1,A Money Machine for Brother,"Do not buy this machine. We have had our machine for about 6 months and have had nothing but problems. The setup instructions are terrible. There are lots of ""capabilities"", but it takes hours of calls to get them to work. The printer cartridges run out, even when you do not use them. They are expensive, and Brother service does not acknowledge the problem--They refuse to give you an estimate of number of copies. Bottom line, save your money. You will lose a fortune on cartridges--If one color runs out- which it will in several weeks, even if it's not used, you can not use the machine at all."
1,The scam is in the $INK$,"I have had this machine for six months. I haven't had a problem until all of the sudden, it said all the ink is empty and it won't work at all. Now I have to spend another $50 to replace all the ink cartridges even though the color cartridges still seem to have plenty of ink in them. If you want to buy this machine, figure on spending $100 per year on ink. After calling customer service, they suggest using the color print option at least once a week so that the unit won't need to self-clean as much, which uses up the ink. I personally believe the self-cleaning feature has been beefed up to do it's thing more often than needed in order to help out Brothers ""INK REVENUE"" line item."
1,An ink sucking piece of junk,"This printer uses more ink cleaning itself... at all hours of day and night ... than I use printing documents. If one cartridge goes empty, the machine shuts down and won't do ANYTHING! Won't even SCAN!Had an error code xxxx??? that required a factory phone call. Ended up driving forty miles each way to a hole-in-the-wall ""dealer"" who had stacks of them in his ""showroom"" waiting for new print-heads. Had to go back in a week to pick it up. Right.... 40 miles each way.By the way, the Smart UI OCR is almost impossible to disable and it takes a lifetime to load into background on each startup. Ditto for the image manipulator, which is otherwise pretty handy.I figure it will be cheaper to junk this thing and buy a new HP or something ....right....LASER !!!!...I don't care how much the machine costs, I'll never have another ink-jet or Brother."
1,Ditto everyone else,"I dealt with it when the printer burnt through its extremely expensive ink cartridges like there was no tomorrow. I accepted that it was going to ""self-clean"" at any hour of the day, wasting more ink the process. But when I ended up with ""Machine Error 41"" and learned that tons of other Brother MFC consumers get the same message, leaving them with completely useless machines, I had had it. My printer is less than 2 years old, which means, apparently, that Brother would fix the machine if I get it to a service center, but at this point, I'm not sure it's even worth it."
2,ANOTHER ERROR 41 DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER,"Make sure you do a Google check on Brother and Machine Error 41... these machines are notorious for print head problems and Brother will NOT replace the unit... they will only give you a refurbished unit which will also give you ""error 41"" in a short time... DO NOT BUY A BROTHER PRINTER... ONLY IF WE BOYCOTT THIS POOR-CUSTOMER SERVICE COMPANY will we get them to improve their quality and customer response practices!"
1,Poor Customer service,"This product was received on time, but still not operating as customer service representatives are most unhelpful. Sunanda Gupta (Phone number 312-355-7219)has contacted customer service several times in writing and on phone. After waiting for long period, the customer service representave says that arrange for one additional phone as he cannot help otherwise. I do not know how many phones they need and Why? They do not give any reason for it. Moreover, I do not understand why They need another phone when problem is with printer and in any case internet connection is with DSL.i THINK IT IS A BLUNDER TO DEAL WITH SUCH MANUFACTURERES"
3,Quaint performance of a masterpiece opera.,"This is a quaint performance, the sparse stage does not detract from the nice performances. My only real quibble is the sound quality. For a DVD released in 2001, I was surpised that it only had 2.0 stereo. Add to that the fact that I had to turn the volume way up on the stereo just to get normal output.Overall good, but could be better sound-wise."
4,Uniformly well done!,"I had only seen one other performance of ""Le Nozze"" and that was live in San Francisco. That performance was perhaps perfect in every way! Unfortunately for the DVD production, it thus was viewed against rather high expectations.The other reviewers do not slight the singing and I agree that it is superb. Similarly, the acting is quite good, especially for an opera. In two ways I was a bit disappointed: the sets were somewhat unimaginative and the overall spirit of the performance was slightly lacking -- the San Francisco performance had me smiling broadly throughout the performance and its stunning aliveness is not often found in opera (of course, it featured the incomparable Sylvia McNair, who has it all!)I can therefore imagine that this may not be the definitive ""Le Nozze."" But watch it anyway!"
2,a flat performance,"I was quite suprised to read the very positive reviews of this video. I have 6 versions of Le Nozze and this comes a distant last in that pile. In my opinion, the performance lacks charisma, subtlety and musical beauty. Furlanetto is certainly a great singer but he fell flat here in every scene for me. Perhaps this was the artistic direction or the transfer from the stage to the small screen but the affect was a uniform disappointment.For a contrast, in my collection, the Glyndebourne production with Finley, Hagley and Fleming reigns supreme not only amongst Le Nozze but over all comers..."
5,Great for the Professional Coffee Drinker,"If you are the type of person that gets a cup of coffee as soon as you you get to the office... then this is the mug for you. Coffee stays hot for hours, great for those who like to sip coffee all moring. Large capacity... no need to run back and forth to the coffee maker. Cleaning is easy! Very professional and hi-tech appearance! The wide bottom keeps the mug from tipping over, especially handy if you work with important documents around. I enjoy having a hot cup of coffee in the morning at work. I can fill the mug at 8am, leave it at my desk and go to a meeting, and come back to my desk with the coffee still hot. Wonderful Mug!... now if I could just do something about the quality of coffee in the office... hmmmm. (smile)"
4,"Good, but not the best","After reviewing the other reviews and seeing the price, I expected this to be the greatest mug of all time. While it is a good mug, (that's why it got 4 out 5) I am not so sure if it is the worth the steep price.I'll start with the good points: Large capacity is good. It is very easy to clean, and you can take apart the stopper to wash it all out. It does keep a ""full"" (see complaints) mug of coffee hot for about two and a half hours, which is pretty good. The shape is very easy to handle for a big mug. Plus Thermos will replace it for five years. Last is that It just looks cool.I do have a few complaints. First off is that if you don't fill it up all the way it doesn't keep the drink very hot or cold for very long. 20 oz of coffee is a lot to drink or throw out. The only other complaint I have found is that it tends to trap water where the plastic meets the metal. So you have to be careful after you wash it and use it again. Coffee water will drip out a bit."
3,Leaks and IS breakable,"The mug is a great, wide bottom, mug with an easy to hold handle. It keep coffee hot a good three hours or more, better than any I've ever used.... and I've used a lot BUT; after a while it starts to leak, you have to play with putting the top on just right to get it to work. I've stained more shirts because of the faulty seal. And it advertises as being unbreakable... well, I dropped the mug from about 2 feet and the top broke into several pieces. I called the company, and they will SELL me a new top, but not replace it (it's warrantied for 5 years in normal use) I'd think it quite normal to drop a steel mug or knock it off a desk or table, but that's just me. Bottom line, great for keeping coffee hot, but too expensive for the length of time you can use it trouble free."
5,Fantastic Travel Mug,"I am a Truck Driver, usually driving 300 miles or so per day on route delivery. Lots of stops and starts with lots of bumps and speed breakers. In the approx. year I have owned this I haven't had one spill or leak from it.Coffee is usually good for a few hours 2-3. After that it is still warm but just not what I think of as hot. Cold is even better. If you aren't finished in 2 hours you should be looking for a thermos anyway."
4,Great for people who drink coffee all day,I own this mug and I have coffee in it from the time I wake up till I go to bed and it very rarely gets cool (only when I leave it sitting for hours when it's near empty) The insulating qualities of this mug are great and it's very handy. Be careful not to drop it though because of the vacuum insulation it is easy to dent. Mine has a couple of small dents because I have dropped it in the sailboat a couple of times but the dents add character and give me stories to tell. Overall it is the best coffee mug I own.
3,Ok mug but not worth $$$$,After reading all the glowing reviews I was convinced this was the mug for me. I was disappointed after gettting it.My main complaint is heat loss. An hour or two after filling and the coffee is luke warm. Add to this that it can't go in the microwave to reheat since it is metal and you are stuck with cool coffee.On the plus side the container is very stable and I havent tipped it over yet.I would keep looking...
3,So So,"The build quality is pretty poor. One of the 2 that I received was broken. The spring was not attached so I had to take it apart and fix the rivet. However, it does function, and the push release works surprisingly well. So it does serve its purpose, but I'm not sure how long it will last. Tough to find anything else with the quick release function."
3,It's OK,It is steel but very light steel. I read a review stating some problems with the drawer. If the factory had spent $1.00 more on heavier duty components it would have received a 5 star rating. Here's my easy fix: for the push button release-spray a light shot of dry lubricant-works like a charm; for the drawer not opening easily and a sloppy fit: cut a six inch long 2x4 and put it behind the spring mount in the rear-perfect! Works like my other more expensive cash drawer.
1,crap,"Product was built very cheaply. Drawer did not open by pushbutton, so I removed the drawer and I discovered the opening spring mount was bent which had the spring positioned so it was too short to push the drawer. (????) I pushed the spring mount forward to align the spring and the extremely poor rivets let go. It is insanely frustrating to repair and item you just took out of the box - especially for a store opening!Drawer slides / mechanism very cheap too - the drawer sits at an angle to the right when opened, further showing its poor design.Stay away - this should retail for $40 max for what you get...A cheap stamped lightweight sheet metal drawer with an injection molded plastic removable cash tray."
2,"Overpriced, too thin and lacking in depth","This is an excellent book for introductory JavaScript...right up to the point where some depth is required (event handling and the DOM). WHile there are many script provided, which virtually all work, they become convoluted and suffer from a lack of clarification and purpose. Often times, the author places something into a script- to show a different way of doing it, which is great- however an explanation is required. As is a much greater explanation of the DOM.I was disappointed with this book because of the price and the content. No CD means lots of typing!Altogether a shallow book with admirable traits but not enough execution where it counts: at the business end of things. As for the word 'design' in the title, there is little of that, in the true sence of the word. Next edition??"
5,Excellent book,"In my experience, it is one of the best books for JavaScript. Clearly written with exceptional handling of concepts and examples. Obviously written by a person with a great deal of experience in today's technologies as well as communicating technical subjects."
5,The Best Italian Langage DVD,"My primary reason for the purchase of this product was to have an Italian DVD to use while walking on my treadmill. Before making the purchase, I reviewed all the Italian DVDs at my local library. Of the six DVDs that I was able to obtain this was by far the best. The package consists of one instructional DVD (very useful) one travel DVD (of little value) an instructional CD (very useful) and a music CD (of little value).The instructional DVD and CD contain the basics of Italian which will be useful to anyone traveling in Italy. I have given the product a five star rating because it is the best of the Italian language DVDs on a comparison basis. Please note, I use this product solely as an adjunct to my Italian language CDs which are much more comprehensive."
4,"Good fit, alright coverage","I was looking for something to help cover my face while on the water to keep from getting burned. This hat works well, the fit is great. I am used to wearing normal length billed caps, so this took a little to get used to, but so far has worked well. Fits good - had high winds last weekend after Hurricane Earl & it stayed on with no worries about being blown off.Love the charcoal color"
3,Cap peak is way too long!,"Cap peak is way too long! It's an inch longer than the longest cap I have and all I have are low profile ones with relatively long cap peaks. Fabric and whole outlook are just fine. But the cap spoils it all. However, I will leave it for picnics etc because it would protect my face from sun perfectly. I don't consider it to be wearing on a daily basis - I was laughing at my own reflection with this hat on, my wife also laughed at me when I put it on and showed to her. Well, may be this is another reason I'm gonna keep it, positive emotions are priceless lol."
3,- 2 star for Amazon not checking returns,"great product and i love the case that they come in.however, amazon needs to do a better job inspecting returns. the 1st set i received had packaging tape wrapped around the case which was difficult to remove and left the case very sticky. then when i opened the case, i saw 3 very small tips taped together and taped to the case to prevent them from rattling around. i thought it looked suspicious and doublechecked the reviews here where someone had listed the tip #s. of course, there were 3 large tips missing, and the small ones didn't even have Ateco brand on it! someone must've returned the item and kept the 3 tips they wanted and replaced them with some off-the-shelf tips.customer service was very good and sent me a replacement promptly, this time the case was shrink wraped properly & nothing was missing.glad to have my set now, but -2 stars for having me drive to UPS and me having to buy a large tip while waiting for replacement to arrive."
4,"Ateco does well, once again, but Warehouse Deals leaves something to be desired.","The tips are what one might expect. Keep in mind they are really quite large - most of these aren't meant for intricate detail work. As a result, they are great for things like cream puffs, eclairs, or swirls on cupcakes. Ateco makes good quality tips. The tips themselves are 5-star worthy, I knocked my rating down a star not because of the item itself, but because I bought through Amazon Warehouse Deals (which I've done many times) and one tip was missing, and another tip was duplicated. To me, this indicates mediocre quality control of some of the Warehouse Deals, especially when the discount wasn't very much."
3,Too large,"These are very large tubes, none would work for writing or normal decorating. They are not for all-purpose or general use. I will have to find another set for cookies; these large tubes will be OK for some cakes. Be sure you really want large tips before ordering.Otherwise, they are well made and come in a convenient round storage container."
3,Poor picture quality due to PAL conversion and BBC taping,"Of course, the performance is phenomenal, and the 5.1 sound mix is the best treatment that Bjork has ever gotten. Of particular note regarding the 5.1 sound mix is that bass redirection is appropriately conservative -- a rare occurrence.The problem with this release is a set of twin factors: (1) the BBC filmed the production, which is a state-subsidized British agency that can never be accused of being state-of-the-art (or, for that matter, using HDTV gear); and (2) I presume that it was filmed in PAL video format. Accordingly, the quality is poor though I see frequent artifacts of remastering and I don't doubt that the mastering engineers did the absolute best that they could with the source material.For the sound mix alone, together with Bjork's virtuosity, however, it is a wonderful addition to your library. (I shall, however, continue to skip past ""Possibly Maybe,"" a song that Bjork unfortunately seems to lug out at every show.)"
2,Dissatisfied,I love this song and video so I ordered two (one for a friend). One had an England sticker on it the other has a Germany sticker. I cannot get either one to play the video. I am totally disappointed in this marketing ploy. I realize some people are luckier than I am and I wish I knew what they did to get the video to play.
2,"Pleasant enough, but lacks comprehensive detail","Great pictures, but like all books of this type, it could have used more, particularly some updated shots of what the sites look like today. I would have been more interested in building details like fly systems, layouts, dressing rooms, stage sound and lighting, marquee setups, rehersal spaces. The stories of the people involved were just teasers, forcing the reader to look to outside sources for details. The book includes the addresses of the theaters, but did not include a map, which would have enhanced our visualization of the theater district. All in all, unsatisfying to read... it felt incomplete."
2,Confuse,"Please forget my English if is not correct. I'm praying for the restoration of my marriage someone recommend this book because they dont believe God can change my husband heart but the only thing that kind confuse me about this book is God hates divorce Mal 2: 16 Ruth Baker was divorced (Mark 10:12) . What happen why she didn't pray for her first husband? (see I cor 7:16 (explain why is so important to pray for you spouse.)Your spouse and the courts say your marriage is dead, but God said in Ez. 37 I am going to breathe new life into it. God wants to show the world His mighty power for God to get all the glory, honor and praise when your marriage is raised back to life again. Please never give up in your marriage even if is dead. Many are the plans in a man's heart, but it is the Lord's purpose that prevails.' Proverbs 19:21"
1,Hmmmm ...,"Many women in churches are single and this is a source of unhappiness and frustration. Derek Prince was married at 30 for 30 years. He was then single for a whole 3 years before meeting his second wife (Ruth) and, after her death was single for 5 years before his own death at the age of 88.Fine if he wants to offer advice to married people because he has shedloads of experience of marriage. But his experience of singleness is pretty sketchy, as far as I can see.And as for Ruth Prince's suggestions about a teapot ..."
5,Great Book for every couple.,"The Book was amazing, shared great scriptures from the bible, about marriage, and always supported this.Both authors mentioned that marriage is the best lifestyle for living. That it was great for them and mentioned great points it would be great for you.I suggest every single, who is a christian or not, to read this book."
3,Interesting life story - may not apply to everyone,Definitely an interesting life story and take on whether God does or does not choose a husband/wife for each person but still not sure if I agree with the idea of one specific person being out there for me.
3,Interesting book with Scriptural benefits for to be couples,"This is my first book from Derek Prince. One of my friend recommended me to buy this book. So, i purchased 2 books one for and for my girlfriend. The narration starts slow and interestingly but somehow drifts away to other side of the story how the Author puts his story that leads him to marry again and from there on. I somehow don't agree with a few things which has nothing to with Scripture but with personal belief system. Over all, a good book that truly describes the importance of Marriage between "" a man and a woman"" which started in the Garden of Eden and how sacred it is to keep it going."
1,"Cheap, but worthless.","Even with the settings cranked up to maximum, this microphone simply did not work unless held less than an inch from my mouth, and I am hardly quiet. Even 3-4 inches away, it produced a barely audible, very muffled whisper. If clipped to the collar, it picks up nothing at all but a background hiss. It is simply not worth buying, at any price."
1,Disappointed,Transmision is of poor quality. Have to hold the mic up to your mouth to be able to be heard. Disappointed in this product.
1,not so hot,"this mic is cheap, but has serious limitations. you need to be quite close to it for effective voice capture, no more than a few inches away. i tried playing with all my audio settings, plugging into different jacks, using and not using mic boost, etc. to no avail. it works up close, and has decent fidelity, but nothing amazing. i don't see the point of the lapel-holder as it is too far away from your mouth to pick up your voice (if it's on your shirt). though it's a cheap deal, i wouldn't recommend it unless you don't mind holding a mic to your mouth for an extended period."
1,A toy would work better,"I paid $7.88 for this last week & it's definitely going back to the store. I used (or tried to use) it for Skype and unless I held it right up to my mouth, I couldn't be heard. There was also a terrible echo on the other end. By the end of a one hour coversation, it had quit working completely. I had a Skype microphone that worked fine until my daughter decided to play Hannah Montana with it and broke it. I wouldn't recommend even bothering this this thing, when it works, it works poorly and sporadically."
3,Didn't meet my expectations,I needed a microphone for recording and this microphone had a lot of static which was difficult to remove even with Adobe Audition. This microphone should probably be or non-professional use. I went onto purchasing the LG USB headset for around $20 and getting the result I expected.
3,Above Average,"It will not be the best buy you ever made,but it works well.Nothing fancy just practical, it does what it says it should."
2,Not convenient to use,"I thought it has a clamp and thus is easy to move from one laptop/monitor to another. However, it does not have a clamp. I feel a kind of disappointment."
2,Poor Sound Reception,"The microphone did not pick up my voice very well,to the point where it was absolutely uselesswhen on my collar, as a lapel. Not worth the cheap price."
4,Prophecy of rock!,"This is only the beginning! The Act is New Yorks apocalyptic party band. This album is amazing. The songs tell the story of a young man sent to Earth to save us with his rock music! But, their new stuff is even better. Watch out for this band, they're going to be big. But be warned, they have foretold the coming of the the end. So why not dance the night away with The Act once last time before your judgement!?"
5,only complaint is the trigger,"only complaint is the trigger,,, butt-- an easy fix! use a air die grinder and a carbide burr and in no time it is a custom fit! It uses very little air at 10 psi.I just went through 2 cases of caulking for a lap siding house. It is easy to control the flow and when you let off the trigger the caulking stops. My only regret is I shold have bought it a long time ago."
4,Campbell Hausfeld PL1558 air caulk gun,"Most people have complained about the poorly designed trigger. As someone pointed out, it was easy to reshape it with my Dremel. Another complaint was it not having enough ""push"" for thick adhesives. The box AND instructions clearly state that the tool can handle up to 90 psi. This is WAY more than needed for any type of job. I'm using this gun to dispense very thick urethane adhesive for windshield replacement and haven't had any trouble, even on cold days. If you have a decent compressor it should have a air regulator to adjust the pressure. This product works great and doesn't feel cheap in your hands. I was looking at an electric rechargeable caulk gun for $259.00, this one was at my door for under $30.00!"
2,Too messy,"It's perfect for caulking outdoors. Indoors, not so much. I'd rather stick with the manual gun for that. I like how I can hook it up with a regulator to regulate the flow, but the trigger almost seems like it's either an on or off position. When you let the trigger go, it doesn't stop the flow immediately. You have to wait for a little trickle to come out. Too messy for me. It sure can burn through a tube of caulk in less than 30 seconds if you turn up the regulator.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone really. There are better products out there."
4,A Hand Saver,"Did a big project with this and it works great. Trigger is a little uncomfortable, but functional. Better than squeezing a hand caulk tool anyday."
4,Almost perfect,"I hate caulking. I always make a mess. I found a way to caulk like a pro for cheap. It lets you lay an almost perfect bead of caulk for as long as you can keep up with the seam your caulking. My arm got tired before the caulking ever changes density, flow, consistency, or anything. Only problem is the trigger was design by someone who hates fingers. The trigger is very awkward and it pinches your finger as you press the trigger. However, I'd still buy it and use it. I'd like them to redesign the simple trigger and make it comfortable for human beings.Mike"
3,As others have said...,"I started out of the box with modifying the trigger as others have indicated. Once that was done - took about 3 minutes, it worked pretty well. A few reviewers stated that it did not leak, but it probably depends on what you are caulking with - I did have a small amount of leakage. All in all, a decent purchase."
3,Real time and hand saver,"Had a ton of caulking to do that was a very narrow crack - like a mile. Because I had to make the hole in the end of the tube so small, it was extremely hard to caulk by hand due to the back pressure. Got this and it did it like a dream. Only set it for about 25# of pressure and my wife actually did the whole thing while I did another project. One thing - the trigger ergonomics are terrible. It kills your finger. I don't know what empty headed engineer designed that... Also, mine arrived with a damaged seal in the output end. It still worked, albeit with leaking air, but I had to get things done. It looks like I can fashion a new one out of gasket material from the auto store. Still like the gun."
5,Calligrapher approved!,"I am a calligrapher, and this paper works great for what I do. Does well with gouache inks. I approve it!"
3,Not good for Easter egg coloring,"I bought this set because my niece was obsessed with having a black Easter egg (kids!) long story short, even though I used an entire bottle the coloring of the eggs were not vibrant. Not sure how they would work for baking so that's why they are still getting 3 stars."
4,Vibrant colors...,"The colors are very true to what is presented with only a few drops of coloring. Of course, red still requires a little more effort in order to not be pink...but at least you can get there with these gels!"
1,NOT Organic,These ARE NOT ORGANIC or even natural. Do not buy them if that is what you are looking to buy!!
1,Horrible,It's didn't work like proper food coloring at all. It ruined my red velvet cake and it is also a very messy product.
4,"small, but condensed color","I made brightly-colored cupcakes with these, using only a couple of drops - you don't need to use a lot to achieve a bright color. My only complaint is that they don't come with a guide laying out how many drops of what color combination are needed to achieve a specific new color. Other than that, they are definitely worth it and much better than the cheap ones you find at the grocery store."
4,A Great Opera Sung by a Great Bass,"This is a truly Grand Opera with a huge chorus and perhaps the greatest bass of his time, Samuel Ramey, singing he lead. This production is great, but taken from video tape, so the visuals are not hi-definition quality. But it sounds good on my home theater system. I've only seen this opera twice, since it is not performed very often, but I've never forgotten the majestic and beautiful music. I love this opera, and I really loved Samuel Ramey. It is a treat just to hear this really amazing voice."
3,"""Mefistofele""","This is a dissappointing and sometimes silly version of an opera that deserves better. The Prologue in heaven lacks grandure, the camera stays parked on a prop as if left there by mistake, and the costumes are uncertain. Ramey performed the role around the world, and he must have been tired. The singing by Dennis O'Neill and Gabriela Benackova is adequate but does not compensate for such staging as a Walpurgis Night that looks like a drunken party in pajamas. The San Francisco chorus and orchestra lack precision, and no one seems to believe in the work at all. (Yes, the composer, Arrigo Boito, was Verdi's librettist for Otello.)"
4,Wondrous,"In voice, physique, and bearing, Ramey is simply the perfect Mefistofele. After him, it's the chorus that stars, and when Ramey and the chorus get together in the amazing Witches' Sabbath, with the devil in a tailcoat furiously conducting the revellers, it's unforgettable. This is simply a beautiful production, well worth owning even if some of Boito's music is not first-rate. I subtract a star for an unconvincing Faust and a mediocre image with an unacceptable level of motion blur."
3,Brother Print Head LK0935001,I have a MFC3420-C that uses the same print head as the MFC-3820C It also does frequent self cleans. Not once did I let the ink go totaly empty yet the Red ink stopped printing. The cause is the tray (print head) the ink plugges in to. part number LK0935001. Sells for about $35 on ebay. $10 to ship. That is more than you can find a used printer for. As long as it has a good print head the brother printer is a great all in one. However Trash it once it stops printing or acts up.
1,Not a good long term solution,"The good news: This printer does work as a network printer/scanner/fax with your Windows XP computers.The bad news: It is prone to long, very noisy sessions of head cleaning, which seem to eat up a lot of the tiny ink carts.And like so many others, one day it will show ""Error 41 - Call Brother"". At that point it is toast.I regret buying this printer and will never buy another Brother product."
2,"Great Features, Poor QC","I did lots of research before plucking this one out. I wanted to replace my ageing thermal paper fax, an ink-eating Epson 830 printer and a Canon Parallel Port scanner. It was difficult because all of them still work!I chose this one because of the features. They all worked for a short while until the machine blew up. Guess that can happen to any tech thing these days but I lost all faith in it and changed to a Canon MP730. The difference in build quality is astonishing.Make sure you get a good one!"
1,Too expensive,"I purchased the 3820cn several years ago to use as my primary machine. I have used the fax only 3 times. The copy function is good, but I have been unable to get the enclosed scan program to work at all.The worst thing is that printer runs out of ink even if I havent used it for several weeks. Tonight i tried printing a very important document to only discover it is out of ink AGAIN. The ink cartridges (four of them) are priced at ~$18 locally and they all have to be replaced about every three months. I would give this thing a minus number and recomend to my freinds to go another brand."
1,Piece of Junk!!!!!!!,"MFC 3820 Slightly over 1 year old, extremely light use. It stopped functioning and displays ""Machine Error 41, Call Brother Service"". I Unplugged unit, waited, plugged it back in. Same error message. Google searched ""Brother MFC Machine Error 41"" and discovered thousands of people have had this problem more than once. In addition, this MFC uses Ink like mad, frequent cleaning cycles consuming ink, MFC says ink is out when you can clearly see ink remaining in the cartridge. I'm going to take this MFC into my garage and smash it senseless with an 8-pound sledgehammer. I will then drive over the bits & pieces several times with my 6000 pound SUV. For good measure, I will then torch all that remains with a blowtorch. Finally, I will go buy an HP!"
1,Completely unsuitable for business use...,"We use 2 of these units at the resort where I work. They worked fine for about 2 months, then they started failing. They DEVOUR ink, due to the fact that the ink cartridges are friggin' TINY. We are currently using 2 black cartridges and 1 of each of the 3 color cartridges per week, per machine. Also, the printer is horribly slow compared to other brands. Printing a check-in sheet for a guest takes longer than it should. The cartridges leak over time causing the machine to get gunked up and sticky inside, which makes the printing sound terrible. We are currently replacing both these units with something better..."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MACHINE,"As with the other reviews...this thing uses ink like it's going out of style. It cleans itself like 30 times a day. What finally happened is the magenta stopped printing. Apparently it happens to EVERYONE who has this machine. Do yourself and favor and buy a different brand. Brother DOES NOT care about the consumer. No matter how many times you call, they just tell you to take it to the repair center where you will spend about the same amount to fix it as it would cost for a new printer. BUYER BEWARE!"
1,JUNK!,"Do not waste your money on this printer! We had an Error 41 while it was still under warranty and had to send it in (which means we were without a printer/copier/fax for about a week and a half). After it got ""fixed"", we got another Error 41 (Imagine that!!) right after our warranty expired! Save your money. Buying this piece of junk means constantly buying expensive ink (the print head uses a lot of ink while cleaning), having to send the printer in to be repaired, and then ultimately trashing it after the warranty expires."
1,nice way to treat your customers brother,"when every single person posts about this error 41 and yet the company continues to sell defective products, well, that shows you what they think of their customers.never never never again brother."
1,bad printer,I never owned a printer that I came to hate so quickly as this. We have had this machine less than a year with fair results at best. Now I have the dreaded error 41 message. That's how I got here...I find that means throw it away or hassle with the company and still own a bad machine. Don't buy this!
2,"Wonderful Machine, Horrible Software","The Brother MFC-3820CN is a wonderful device; it is very fast and easy to use. However, the software is horrible. I will set the software on Monday, shut down my computer and it will revert to default. the interface is confusing, and the max resolution though Windows XP's* interface i2 only 1200 DPI compared to the 4800 DPI achievable through the software. Overall, if you only want a stand alone Copier / Fax I would recommend the brother. If you are looking for a scanner, than I would keep looking.*Windows is a registered trademark of the Microsoft Corporation"
1,The Brother MFC-3820CN,"I purchased the Brother MFC-3820CN (...), my first one after 6 months died, after getting an ERROR 41 on its screen, the second one, well works, but its a pain to find ink thats cheap and it won't work well with Compatibles, so don't buy them, second, when you print out a picture, the picture quality stinks, everytime I printed out a picture after the first time, the pictures always had horizontal lines through it, It just stinks, I can't believe I purchased it. DON""T BUY IT... By an EPSON OR OTHER KIND..be sure that you've tested the Picture Print quality so that you don't get Lines through your pictures like I do with this one. The only thing good about it is that, you can make copies...and thats about it."
1,Network is useless,"I have owned this unit for almost 2 years and have yet to actually have the printer/scanner on my home network. According to the user's manual, Menu/Set 5 should give me LAN settings. All I get is a beeping noise. Machine powers up, states the LAN is active, but never appears on the network. I have contacted Brother several times regarding the issue and I still have no access to my printer/scanner on the computer. I now own one of the most expensive FAX/COPY machines available on the market today. I would not recommend this unit and I would not recommend Brother Multi-Function devices."
1,good printer for 3 months,This is a very good printer for 3 months until you get an error 41 and have to call the company. We own 8 brother mfc's and all 8 have failed some replaced 2 and 3 times.
4,new contact user,"I just started wearing contacts and my doctor recommended using Supra Clens and I think it works. I didn't use it at first, then I noticed a difference when I did. It doesn't take any more time to use than my regular cleaner and it last awhile."
3,It didn't work as well as my weekly ...,It didn't work as well as my weekly enzymatic cleaner but it was more convenient.
3,Poor advertisement,"Just so everyone knows, the two controllers are linked to one USB input. This is not advertised any where on the page, so be warned.Overall these controllers aren't that bad, work well (so far) and they don't feel foreign like so many other PC controllers.And not to mention, they're only 20 bucks."
2,2 in 1 No bargain. Has no support & easily breaks,"Stick with Logitech and other known brands... this comes from some shop in Hong Kong... takes weeks to get to you then, has no drivers, or configuring software to install... Suck.. 1 joystick worked okay the second connected one was always screwing up.. Had to use x-padder to get any function out the damn thing ..finally threw it away.. &%&^!!#78.."
2,Came fast but it didn't play,"The movie came surprisingly fast, a few weeks before the estimated arrival. However, I wasn't even able to play the movie. The disc came scratched and won't play past the main menu."
3,Not the right price!!!!!,"I have seen April Fools Day and like it very much, but I have not seen My Bloody Valentine, but thats not the reason I write this. Amazon has this movie priced to high, I bought this movie set at Walmart in Moore, Oklahoma for $7.50. Thats quite a bit of price difference especially when you add in shipping."
1,JVC HAW300RF 900mhz Wireless Headphones,"Following the initial battery charge the phones were immediately functional without tuning and with good volumn and sound and with excellent range. But upon further attempted usage the tunning had apparently drifted as tunning became very critical and somewhat difficult. I suspect that the difficulty was simply the result of a ""learning curve."" Overall I am pleased with the earphones."
1,Consider yourself warned,"These are complete junk. No wonder they're not sold for $120 or whatever the supposed list price was initially. I unpacked these chaged them, tuned them, and listened for about 3 minutes before I packed them back up and hit the ""Return"" button. Three feet from the transmitter in line-of-sight and these were noisy. Music sounds like a tinny AM radio from 1951. Might be usable for talk radio. If you return them - YOU have to pay the shipping! You've been warned."
4,GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE!,"You might be interested in buying these headphones and don't worry it's not a waste of money. If you compare to other you may see that the other main thing is a much highter price. If you are looking for something inexpensive then this is the product. I have owned mine for about a month and I can't say it's been a 100% OK. Sometimes the tone goes down and sometimes statics comes on because I walking too far. It's say you can be over 300 feet away but I can never do it. The beiggest problem that I had with mine was that when I put it in the chager the charging light never came on and when it did it use turn off and I had to ajust it again and again. But over all I think they are a great value for price you may get. I don't think you will be disappointed. After all under ($) wireless headohones ....it's a steal. So, think carefuly and see if they are righ for you! THANK!"
1,"nice design, but don't recomend","Rechargeable batteries not replaceable without sending unit back to manufacture. No automatic mute when signal is lost from base unit. Signal cuts off and on from base unit and sound is damaging to ears. Cannot put in regular batteries while Nicads are recharging. Can't use at all while recharging, period. I took mine back for refund. Bought Sony's for replacement."
5,Excellent Headphones,The stereo pickup is great. Better quality than my previous (RCA) headphones.Electronic Fan is wrong about sending the set back to the manufacture to change the battery. It is not difficult to change the battery. Changing the battery is similar to other electronic devices that require an exhausted battery change.For the price I recommend purchasing it.RJR
4,Pretty good value,"Had mine for a little over a week. Overall I really like them, the only thing I wish they had done a little better is the ""tuning"". Occasionally, in order to eliminate static, you have to adjust the tuning knob on the base or on the headset. It would have been nice if this feature was more ""automatic"". I love the fact that the headset automatically charges when put on the base (no need to buy batteries). I also like the ""Voice Call"" feature which lets someone talk to the headphones user without having to scream.Its audio output is also flexible (allows for either headphone jack or A/V input.)"
1,Very Poor,"These worked off and on for a couple of weeks, and then eventually would not tune into our TV signal at all. They were only 15 ft from the base. I found that after you tune them at the base, once you walked away you would lose the signal. Very difficult to find a clear signal. I'm just going to throw these away. I already picked up a pair of Sennheiser RS 130 Wireless Surround Sound Headphones and absolutely love them. In this case, I guess you really do get what you pay for?"
1,Piece of junk,"I definitely would not recommend these. ""Tuning"" the headphones with that little dial on the side is so annoying, especially in an apartment or place where there is going to be a normal amount of interference. I could only stand it for about two weeks and ended up throwing them away out of frustration. The benefit of wireless is worthless if you cannot even hear anything. No wonder they were 90 dollars off. Had to be a reason they had all the extra inventory."
2,JVC HAW300RF 900mhz Wireless Headphones Evaluation,Major problem with these headphones is the extremely narrow tuning band. In order to listen you have to adjust the headset frequency to the base frequency perfectly. They are both easily adjusted but the tuning goes out quite readily and you either lose sound quality or just get static. I wouldn't buy them again.
5,Perfect for the treadmill!!,I purchased this product because I could never hear the TV over the noise of my treadmill. Now I can catch up on the news and exercise at the same time. I love it.
2,Nice Headphones but .....,"I bought this unit a couple of months ago. It works fine, sound is ok but not as good as I expected. Now the battery doesn't last as long when I charge it so I tried to find replacement part. Well the JVC P/N is J46691-001, and it is $19.95 + shipping + tax. That makes it at about $28, almost half the price the whole unit!!!! forget it."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE THEY ARE USELESS,"There is no reason that these wireless headphones should be purchased by anyone. I intended to use these to replace a set of IR wireless headphones that I use while on a treadmill attached to a TV because as the old IR unit is prone to static if not directly in line of sight of the transmitter.I could not get the JVC headphones to work at less than 8 feet from the transmitter. I adjusted the analog tuner both on the base and on the headset to maximum signal. The fact that there are two places one needs to adjust with a small thumb wheel is a bad sign, but even when properly adjusted the signal drifts and I still hear lot of static. Remember, I am listening to TV not music and on a treadmill so sound quality is not at all critcal here.I am returning these, but I will have to pay shipping."
1,Wireless Headphones from JVC,"I was excited to finally get a decent pair of headphones, but then I realized that after about the first time I used them, they were completely static and I couldn't even adjust the tuning to hear my music clearly even sitting three feet from the unit. Sometimes I can even hear random phone conversations from people beyond the headphones' range. The headphones pick up a lot of outside ""garbage noise"" and not too much of my own music. I might recommend them for use in an area where there will not be as much interference because my only experience with them is using them in a dormitory."
1,NFG,"I tried every possible way to get these to work properly, but could not. This product is completely useless."
2,Too much rawk extravaganza,"The songs are classics you love, but this live collection doesn't add anything to them. The four extra tracks, including the awful cover of ""Reach Out (I'll Be There)"" are throwaways.Stick to your copy of ""Desolation Boulevard""."
2,Don't like the plastic top,"I really dislike the plastic tops. In my opinion the plastic leeches into my hot drinks, giving it a nasty taste. Also the silicone around the cap leaves a nasty taste on the rim of the lid."
4,Works great for teas but only OK for Rooibos,"This is a perfectly sized bottle for brewing up some tea while working at your desk all day. It keeps it very hot as expected. My only complaint is that the mesh of the tea basket could be of a finer weave. When brewing Rooibos, some of the tea gets into the cup. So leave that last half an ounce in the cup or you'll be drinking tea leaves."
1,poorly designed and doesn't hold tea well,I bought this after having another mug from Teavana. I thought I would try the cheaper version but this was a waste of money. The tea infuser is not tightly woven so tons of tea gets into the water - to the point you can't even drink it. Also there is no drip tray for the infuser when your done. There are two different tops so you have to unscrew the infuser part to twist on the drinking lid. Really poor design and useless for tea. May be better for traveling with coffee if you throw away the infuser.
4,Love this Product,"I use this mug every day. I don't drink while going into work, just put my tea leaves of the day in the infuser. I use high quality loose leaf teas from tudorhousetea.com. When I get to work, I can use the infuser 3 times during the day. The tea stays hot, it doesn't leak (unless I forget to screw it on tightly) and it brews a lovely cup of tea. Besides that this mug is tough. Before I added elastic straps to the pockets of my Zero Degrees InnerCool 12 Can Folding Cooler which I use as my lunch bag, my mug hit the driveway and parking lot several times. It never broke and still works great. The only thing I would change on this is the capacity. I wish it would hold 16 ounces."
4,Nice product but deceptive advertising. Holds only 10-11 Oz. Sipper no fit with tea infuser,"OK, this product is so nice that even after this criticism I can give no less than 4 stars :-) This holds only 10 OZ to the safest level when infusing tea. It is not 12 Oz. Also the sipper does not fit with tea infuser in place."
5,Great workmanship,It may not be stunning but it is pretty well made. Easy to wash and works as it is intended to. Fits most office settings I reckon.
3,Thermos Nissan 12-Ounce Stainless-Steel Tea Tumbler with Infuser,"It's kind of a pain having to swap the tea basket out for the drinking piece. I don't like having to carry the drinking piece in my bag on my way to work while my tea is brewing in the basket piece, then having to swap them before I can drink anything."
5,Love it very much,It's everything I've looked for. Its size togather with tea infuser and coffee cap made this thermos perfect for both tea and coffee. Love it so much so I use it every day.
3,Hard to clean......,"This thermos is long and narrow for you not being able to clean the bottom surface with hand. Otherwise, it serves the purpose."
5,A great purchase for a tea lover,"The separated top and tea strainer sections make this the perfect tumbler to take out and about. I purchased this as a gift for a tea lover, he uses it daily and has had no issues so far!"
5,Tea drinkers,"slim, easy to use, and ideal for travel for any tea drinker. It keeps the tea hot for a long time."
1,Infuser basket mesh is too large for loose leaf tea,"My husband bought me two tea mug infusers, from Amazon, this week. The first one to arrive was the clear sided one made by Aladdin, that has the drop down infuser basket (made out of fine mesh) in the lid. I absolutely LOVE that one and have used it nonstop at work all week. This one I am going to try to return on my day off tomorrow, I've had it less than a week so I'm hoping that won't be a problem. I haven't used this one because I can see that the infuser mesh is WAY too large to keep some of the loose leaf teas that I brew from falling through the mesh and into my tea. If you're a diehard, loose leaf tea drinker and want a mug like this then I highly recommend the Aladdin. I am planning on purchasing a couple more of the Aladdins so that I don't have to keep washing the same one over and over throughout my work week."
2,???,"I used this to make smaller amount of tea than what I make in my teapot for a few times and poured the ready tea into a cup. The first time I actually used it to drink out of I realized it doesn't seal and poured all over myself in the car. I'm not sure if they are all this way or mine is just defective, but I'm thinking and hoping its the later because I read good reviews of this product before ordering."
5,Best travel mug ever -- hot or cold,"I love this mug! It keeps my tea hot for literally hours, for those times when I drive off with it in the car, leave it for a yoga class, and return -- still hot. And it keeps things just as well cold. In fact, I often have to remember to take the lid off so it cools just a little. And if I need to pop it in my purse, the cover keeps it sealed tight."
4,"Nice, good quality, but lazy to replace the cover everytime!","Nice, good quality, but lazy to replace the cover everytime!it's smaller then avg other liqued container hot/cold, but i think perferct size, not too big and not too small!alos, well fit your car perfectly, as other mentioned, I hoped next verion will have a handle.Steps:1. add the filter, close it.2. add tea leafs3. pour water4. clsoe lid5. flip upside down, ONLY ONCE!5. remove filer, throw out tea.6. place drinking cover, and enjoy! :)don't flip it twic after you put the tea, as some tea are really good, it will be too much and truns out sore YUK!"
4,Good until the vacuum seal goes,"I loved this mug - it lasted me for maybe 3 years, and it was great, until the vacuum seal popped off, one day. Then it was still a great mug to sip from at work (kept hot liquids hot to warm for 2 - 3 hours) but was not good to carry around in a bag. Though I was able to put the seal back on, and the lid still screws on, liquid dribbles out and onto my books and things. The tea infuser could have been a bit finer (was good for larger, coarser tea leaves, but smaller finer ones would get through). So it's a great mug - I just wish it lasted longer (but then I guess people would stop buying new ones:-)."
4,Keeps hot or cold as promised.,I really do like this traveler but felt that it was too small. I had also lost the top cover. I have the 18 ounce on order. I know I will be pleased. It stays chilled overnight and coffee stays hot all morning.
1,Hot tea with plastic after taste,"This little tea tumbler keeps the tea very very hot. Kept the tea steaming hot for 2 hours. I eventually had to put cold water in to cool off the tea so I would stop burning my tongue.Once the tea was cool enough to drink, the problem was the awful plastic taste I got with the tea. I purchased this product because it was stainless steel. I didn't think about the plastic drinking piece. I used it once, tasted the plastic, and couldn't even finish the tea. Unfortunately the entire thing is headed for the garbage."
4,"Keeps tea hot for hours, but I can't brew tea in it.","I like this mug/tumbler. Keeps my tea hot for hours. I was carrying it around while shopping with my wife. It stayed hot the whole time. Really impressed with the mug.The infuser screen is too course for the tea that I brew, so I have to use another infuser to make tea. Having the infuser work properly would be great. I could let the tea steep while driving to work, then have a hot mug of tea when I get there.I would have given it a 3 for the infuser problem, but the mug works so well that I bumped it up to 4."
4,Perfect mug for commuters,"I used to have one of these before and lost it at a party. Since then I had been looking for a similar one, but could never find a mug with a spill-proof lid. This mug has a screw on lid that allows it to be tucked away in a bag while traveling. Once sealed, this mug will keep a hot beverage hot for well over an hour. It has one lid for coffee or cold beverages and another for tea. Highly recommended for commuters who travel on a train or bus to go to work/school."
2,Overated,"Got one yesterday, not so impressed.It did keep hot water warm after a night, better than Contigo I got from Costco at half price.But it is inconvenient: When I want to drink from it, I have to unscrew the cap. This makes it useless while driving; and after removing the cap, it is same as any other mug or cup, can spill easily.So it is an overpriced, overrated product just like BOSE. I am thinking whether to keep it."
4,Totally leakproof!,"When trying to keep liquids hot or cold when on the go, spillage or leakage is always an issue. This Stainless Tumbler solves the problem beautifully. Once the hot/cold liquid is placed into the tumbler, simply screw the sipping lid on and then add the sealing screw cap. To use, unscrew and remove the screw cap and sip from the sipping lid. The screw cap + sipping lid when screwed on correctly, make this totally leak-proof. And it will keep coffee hot for up to 6 hours!Jim"
1,leakage,"This is the worst online shopping I have ever made!!! There is small hole in one of the twist tops, with a stainless steel strainer, for tea. Water will leak through the crack. The other one for coffee, when you turn the cup upside down, it is not leak-proof at all!!! I was very unhappy about this thermos."
5,Great tumbler,This tumbler is great! My tea stays warm for 5 - 6 hours a day. I even used it in science with my students to explain the difference between an insulator and conductor. They were just as excited as I was to see how long my tea stays warm.
5,Best Thermos I've Owned,"If you're like me, you've lost count as to how many insulated tea/coffee mugs you've bought. This item is like a personal sized thermos and I love how you can put your tea in then dash out the door. I've turned it over in the car - no leaks, I wouldn't hesitate to tuck this thermos down in my briefcase or purse! I've washed in the dishwasher and by hand, both ways were easy. You'll love it."
5,11 years & still going strong!,"I've had this mug/thermos for 11 years (yes, really). It is bombproof. On a whim I just searched for it to see if I could buy another one--not to replace the first one, mind you, but to finally admit that all my other mugs are pathetic in comparison, and I should just buy a second one. I'm a tea drinker, but I don't use it to brew tea. I put brewed tea in it then hit the road. Only thing I don't love about it (?!?!) is that it keeps things hot so well, that I used to scald my poor mouth a lot. So, now I've learned to let things cool a bit before I put them in the thermos, or just run really cold water into it & let it sit for a bit (then empty) before putting freshly brewed tea into it. Ridiculously superior product."
5,"Exactly what I was looking for, and more","I was looking for a stainless steel tumbler with a leak proof lid. This one even came with a tea strainer attachment/inner lid which is a big plus for me! Rather than putting loose tea into the strainer and discarding the tea leaves once brewed, I put the loose tea leaves on the bottom of the cup, attach the strainer lid, pour hot water, place the leak proof lid and out I go. I keep adding hot water to brew the tea more than once -- especially if it's a good quality green tea, you can definitely brew it more than once. It is absolutely leak proof so that I can just throw it in a bag and I don't have to worry about it leaking. I bought one for myself, one for my son and two to give as birthday presents to tea loving friends. They are all loving it. A great product."
3,almost perfect,"I adore this thermos mug, but beware: it is not perfectly leak-proof. The other reviews on this site are absolutely right--it keeps things hot for a wonderfully long time, the tea strainer is fantastically easy to use, and it is in most respects great.HOWEVER, you have to be really careful when you screw the lids on that you do it correctly, or the damn thing will leak all over you. Also, it can be screwed on really well, but after a while, you can still get leaks, and you have to unscrew the tops and put them back on.This is a minor pain, but it still really is a pretty good mug. It keeps things really hot while the outside always remains cool to the touch. But it is not perfectly leak-proof."
4,Excellent,Ideal tool for taking hot water on the go for brewing tea later in the day. Water remains hot for several hours. Highly recommended.
4,Really spill-proof!,"Keeps drinks hot for hours, and the seal is really tight. Wish it was a bit bigger, but otherwise great."
4,Make sure you check drink cap EACH time,Love the way it keeps drinks hot or cold. Be careful that each time you check to make sure that the drinking cap is on just right or it will leak. (Don't wait til you're ready to walk out the door to check or you just might be changing your shirt)
5,Ummm...Good,"I wanted a coffee cup that I could put into my briefcase and take to work that wouldn't leak and would be hot when I got to my destination.This is perfect. It doesn't leak when tossed into a shoulder bag, and keeps the liquid hot for hours.I bought the 12 oz cup because I don't drink that much coffee at one time. It's good for one cup of coffee upon arrival or while traveling to work or wherever.The bottle is very well made. Nice to hold. Cool to the touch eveh after the hot coffee has been in it for serveral hours. Slim enough to fit into my briefcase and I can lay it on its side without a drop spilling.I don't drink tea so I can't say anything about the tea infuser. But from the look of it, it will probably work just fine.It is a great product and I would buy another in a heartbeat if needed.Steve"
2,Started Leaking after 3 Months,"Great product, kept things warm and brewed tea well, until the seal stopped working 3 months later. Coffee leaks every time I sip it now, slipping between the container and the first lid. I will look for another product."
2,Broke after 3 months of use.,"This travel mug works well. It keeps my coffee hot and doesn't leak all over my bag during my bike commute. I pay attention when I wash it and don't have trouble with residual spoiled milk.However, the lid broke after just under 3 months of not-quite-every-day use. The flat, topmost part of the lid completely sheared off from the rest of the lid assembly. Now I have a nice stainless steel flower vase.I don't expect my travel mugs to last forever. But, I do expect them to last for more than 12 weeks."
4,Great Product,I like green tea and this tumbler will do the job just fine... The advantage being that I can take it with me where ever I goI will certainly recommend it to others especially my brotherI would look at getting one for him
3,Just OKAY,"If you are USING the twist top / sip-hole / infuser with the Thermos Nissan 12-ounce Stainless Steel Tea Tumbler with Infuser, it ONLY has a capacity of 10 ounces - there is a fill / mark line on the inside.If you are USING it WITHOUT the twist top / sip-hole / infuser this product WILL hold 12 ounces.FYI: The leak preventative (outer) cap ONLY fits onto the twist top."
3,good mug but a few reservations,"I've had this Tea Tumbler about a month and like it pretty well overall. It keeps drinks hotter for longer, fits my car drink holders, isn't overly ornamented with rubber or other crap, and seals well when you put on the top cap. 12 oz is smaller than many travel mugs but is still a decent quantity. A few reservations though: the mesh is too big on the tea strainer--I make yerba mate every morning and a lot of the leaves slip through. Fooling around with multiple caps is a bit of a pain while driving; why not a drink cap that seals (well) instead of two different caps? Also, maybe some kind of visual indication of where the sipping hole is or maybe something you could feel with your mouth would be helpful."
3,Nissan Mug-bad choice for ME,"This was not a good choice for me, because it has too many parts. I really want a mug that has an infuser built in and that stays in place throughout my cup of tea. I have already misplaced the infuser basket and lid (have had the cup less than 3 weeks) because you have to remove the basket and replace it with another lid to drink. This is messy (where do you set the basket full of wet leaves while you are replacing the lid? Do you carry another item like a plastic container to hold it?) If you make your cup and change lids before leaving home then you'll be all set, but I want to carry leaves and make another cup later (I work 12 hours shifts). It does keep tea warm for hours, so that is a very good feature; it also doesn't spill through the sealing lid made for carrying it in your bag, and this lid will fit over the drinking lid or the leaf basket."
4,Great Cup,"This togo cup doesn't leak. Don't fill it up past the gasket line, screw the lid on and throw it into your bag. Prime it beforehand with hot water and the contents will stay hot for hours.Could hold a bit more liquid for my liking."
2,Leaks; Flawed designs,"This cup leaks between the strainer and the cup. I've spilled tea on myself many times even though I had tightened the seals.Second, this cup is not designed for rebrews or leaving the tea leaves in the cup. You're supposed to brew the tea leaves in the strainer, and throw away the leaves before drinking. ANY REAL TEA ENTHUSIAST KNOW THAT'S NOT THE PROPER WAY TO DRINK TEA. A proper design should keep the tea leaves inside the cup as you drink.Unfortunately since I started using it, I feel obligated not to return it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE SLIGHTLY SERIOUS ABOUT TEA"
2,cup leaks,"when i first bought this cup i loved it. unfortunately i lost it and had to buy another one twice. when i got the new one, it leaked. i sent it back and the next one leaked as well. never gonna get again."
1,Bad return policy,"The product came badly damaged,It was ordered as a gift and so was not opened immediatly, when the product was found to be severly dented I requested their RMA number, it took several days to get that and they only give ten days to return. With the holidays this was impossible and they refused to accept it after those ten days expired. Would not recommend to anyone who wants a quality product and service!"
5,Excellent Thermos,My daughter love this thermos and used it the very day she got it. She said that it was convient and it was easy to use.
5,I LOVE IT!,This is my favorite travel tumbler! I absolutely love it! Keeps my coffee/tea hot for hours and I love the no spill lid.
4,Great Thermos,"I was looking for a replacement to my typical mug and drop in tea infuser as it was getting pretty bad. This thermos definitely fit the bill nicely. It keeps my tea hot while keeping the outside nice and cool to the touch (which can lead to a burnt tongue if you are not careful). It cleans well and provides a decent amount of room for tea leaves (it could be slightly bigger though). Cleaning is a snap. My only two gripes are that it does take quite a few steps to brew the tea. You have to actually change the top and take the lid and move it from one top to the other. Providing a second lid would have made it a little better. Also trying to tell when to stop filling the thermos with the tea infuser still on is a bit of a pain, but you get the hang of it. All in all I am pretty happy with this purchase.PS - As an added bonus the thermos works very well as a bell:)"
5,Great thermos!,"I've had one of these for almost a year and think it's great. Keeps stuff hot or cold for hours ... easy to keep clean (stainless steel) ... doesn't hold flavor from drink to drink. The sipping lid is well-designed and just plain works! It can be transported in any position when fully capped - I'm a bike commuter and I just toss it into my backpack - it never has spilled or leaked. For me, the amount is just right - 12 ounces - keeps me from being a glutton :-) I don't use the tea infuser, so I can't say anything about that."
4,Nice,Great infuser and keeps drinks hot all day! Only one problem is small pieces of tea leaves get through the strainer peice. Other then that great!
5,Play this LOUD!,"Those West Country thrash merchants deliver another slice of bowel-loosening rawk in this, their finest album to date.There's a solid grunge undercurrent, a hint of melodic death metal (occasional growls and whimpers) and an overall country bumpkin aesthetic (black waistcoats and red neckerchiefs).The songs themselves are an unusual mix of high-octane, head-banging numbers and synth-licked ballads, which deal with everything from the joy of stamp collecting to the dangers of Estonia's current monetary policy.However, the real strength of the Wurzels is singer and lead axe-man, Phil (pictured on the right), with his earthy, operatic voice he delivers stirring, anthemic tones that will make your ears bleed - brilliant!"
1,A video which will satisfy nobody...,"Although there are some good scenes of the Kirov production, I was disappointed with this video. It is not a good introduction, and anyone who knows anything about Parsifal will wince frequently. The video includes far too many extracts from other movies, especially Palmer's 'Wagner'. Palmer mixes in music from 'The Ring' which might confuse someone new to the topic. Domingo looks simply awful as Parsifal. There are a couple of scenes with nude swimmers, which appear completely out of place with the style of the Kirov production, and also are totally uninteresting as pornography. It made me realise how good Syberberg's Parsifal is."
2,Pretty disapointing,"I rented this thinking I would be viewing the opera and that was a big disappointment. I did learn a little about how the Grail figures in religious history, which was interesting, but a lot of the commentary by both Placido Domingo, of whom I am a big fan, and also by a few other completely unbalanced people, were a bit ridiculous. Domingo seemed to be saying that the opera could bring world peace and another commentator seemed to think the opera alone was entirely responsible for the holocaust. All a bit simplistic thinking, really."
1,"good performance, worthless commentary","As others have noted, this is not a complete performance. In fact, the scenes from what appear to be an excellent Kirov performance are all too brief. What predominates this otherwise waste of 90 min is a self-serving attempt at commentary by some ""experts"" (who are not) who lack any understanding of the work or even of Wagner. If you want to get to know PARSIFAL, arguably Wagner's masterpiece, leave this alone as there are several books, such as the ENO guide, that do a far better job. If the complete Kirov performance ever does become available, that can be recommended. This cannot."
5,Very fancy glasses...,"They are extremely nice and i love them. Match all my different models of glasses. They are very delicate but gives you a nice style when you have guests. Normally they ask me were i bought them and the answer is always by internet. Where i live you cannot find this kind of items.Best regards,Gaby"
3,less than more,"I bought the book thinking there'd be a whole lot more on La Harpe and his ""adventures"" and his interaction with the Wichita bands of the sourthern plains, but it turned into a book about one dig, what was found there, and speculation about it being the Indian camp La Harpe visited at the end of his trek west into the souther plains.Interesting nontheless, just light on the info I was looking for."
4,Three previous Red Green ditties plus one new one - for the first time on DVD!,"Nobody can anlyze men like the boys atOpossum Lodge, espically Red Green. Niceto see 'specials' like Of Cars and Menon DVD! Pick Up On It!"
2,Don't waste your time...,"Gotta agree with Wookalia's review... terribly written, I even found 3-4 grammar/spelling issues. Hello? who edited this? The story jumped around way too much, character development was awful, and the ending was really anti-climatic. I gave it 2 stars only because the centerpiece of the story is a favorite hobby topic of mine dealing with EBE's and national security."
1,"Great concept, HORRIBLY written","Not going to waste alot of time with long review. Horribly written. Never got to see what brilliance might be in concept because it is long winded, sloppy, POV shifts, excessive adjectives, etc. Just terrible. There is actually a craft to writing, if you aren't going to take the time to learn rudimentary basics of the craft, don't write."
4,Great for The Price,"These are very nice rustic outdoor candle holders. The look stunning on low hanging sturdy tree branches, and I have also hung them as a set of three on a tiered obelisk. The glass hurricanes are of good quality, and they even survived the shipping. The hoops are quite heavy. I bought them for $9.00 each on a Friday sale day, so I was especially pleased."
1,unsatisfied,"I recieved the plant, (not much bigger than a seedling) in a fair amount of time. It was very small. The shipping was nearly the cost of the plant. It was to be a gift whose birthday wasn't for another 10 day's. Within a day or two it already started looking sickly. I wrote the sender and told them about it and requested a new plant. After my sending them a picture at their request and several e-mails I was refunded for the plant. I stated I wanted a new plant not a refund. (My sister wanted this plant and I know anyone can have a plant die, doesnt' mean they all will) I was told I got a refund and I could order it again. I explained it hardly seemed fair for me to have to pay shipping on it again when I only asked for an exchange. It didn't matter to them. I'm not happy with their response and am surprised at amazon. Maybe they need to know how this company responds to problems. I asked for an exchange not a refund. Should have been no problem.Sue Norman"
1,Do not buy this mouse,"It is overpriced for Amazon. You can get a cheaper mouse at Staples, ect...It is very jumpy and I've abandoned use of it altogether."
2,A little disappointed,"Although this was an interesting read, it wasn't what I expected. I thought it would have something about the recent rediscovery of the ivory-bill, but it did not. In this book, the part about the bird in the United States basically ends when the woods were cut in Louisiana in the 1940s. It has some information about later sightings in Cuba in the 1980s, but that's it. I wanted to hear about more recent sightings and of course the rediscovery in Arkansas. That said, this is a good kid's book, and I intend to pass it along to my 13-year-old nephew."
1,A ripoff,"This book is basically a ripoff of ""Hope is the Thing with Feathers,"" by Christopher Cokinos (written four or five years earlier than this one). All the material about the fight to save the Singer Tract in the 1940s (which is the best part of ""Lord God Bird"") appeared in Cokinos' book, and that book was written for adults. This book is for sixth graders."
4,What I expected for the price,"These were exactly what I expected. The reviews are accurate -The holes are not always spot on, but my shelves are put together with some struggle, there was A LOT to put together :) some of the boards were a little warped too, but not at all warped enough to return or give a horrible review, like I said, it's what you should expect for the money and if you've shopped around, it's a pretty good deal if you don't need a ""formal"" shelf."
2,"If you have a power drill, you'll be fine.","So I went ahead with the product understanding fully what to expect with it. I have a power drill, so I was able to get the thing together, but the holes didn't line up at all, I don't know why they even bother to drill them in for you. If you're an expert wood cutter save yourself the money and just cut the pieces yourself. I have no experience with wood cutting however and had to fork out the money for the sake of convenience. If you know what you're doing, don't spend the money. For everyone else, it's probably worth it for a cheap bookshelf."
1,"Dismal, you'll need a power drill","Dismal! The ""predrilled holes"" to attach the shelves are completely askewed to one another, it is impossible to actually use more than half of those holes, forcing you to go get (buy) a power drill to drill other holes that are actually lined up useably."
1,MAX TOOL SHIPPED INCORRECT ITEM,"Ordered 100ft. extension, received 50ft. extension. VERY DISSAPOINTED in that I needed the product in a specific time frame and MAX TOOL was not willing to express ship the correct item. Requested a refund. A dissatisfied customer. Would rate the deal zero stars if that was possible."
4,"Pure ""Grain""","Tidewater Grain comes at you straight ahead with ""no frills"" rock n' roll. Obviously influenced by the masters (Van Halen, Aerosmith, Ramones) with a twist of Faith No More, they present an interesting sound. Lead singer Kevin McNamara sounds at times uncanilly like David Lee Roth. The rhythm section keeps the ""thick sound"" going! Standout tracks include ""Rocket Ship"", ""Here On The outside"" and ""Annie Helicopter"". These guys are in for some BIG things to come."
5,Noticeably better,"Power increase? Well i can not prove that these plugs actually get me better horse/torque I definatly noticed an increase is throttle response and all over power. This is an all original 1983 Datsun 280zx I am talking about, not a state of the art engine here, I imagine that a newer engine would be less sensitive to spark plug design, but hey, if it's noticeable, it's noticeable! I replaced a set of standard NGK plugs with 8k miles with these platinum IR plugs, don't get me wrong, NGK makes a good plug, but these are noticeably better.My prior experience with Bosch plugs tells me that these will be very reliable."
4,"Good, but only really holds one sponge.","This holder attaches to the wall well and looks nice, but only really holds one sponge. It looks a bit bigger in the picture"
1,won't stick,"I should have listened to others.... no, this thing won't stick, trust me. I bought it coz it was cheap... yea... but if you are looking for something that sticks, don't buy this one."
1,Picture is deceptive,"I bought this caddy based on the picture showing the scrub brush fitting in it - while the one in the picture fit, the one I have and the ones you can find at the store don't, and I've looked in multiple places including kitchen stores."
5,Love it!,Does exactly what it's supposed to. I don't have to worry about it rusting. It's easy to clean. It does come un-stuck once in awhile but no biggie.
4,Great way to store your dish sponge,I put this on the inside of my sink to hold my dish sponge. It allows me to avoid putting a wet sponge on my counter and the holes in the holder allow for air to circulate to dry out the sponge when not in use. It is also small enough not to be in the way in my double sink. The suction holds up well too.
4,yeahh,no more stinky sponges from not drying out all the wayjust wish they send a couple of extra suction cups since they fail often
3,So...So...,"Wouldn't buy this product again, instead would buy one from my local retail store so that I could see and touch the product before purchasing. Added this to my cart cause I needed to spend a few extra dollars to get free shipping. Didn't work in my sink, but that's my fault for not looking at its dimensions. Just a note: stupid me thought it came with the scrub brush. Not sure I would have bought it if I had read the description closer!"
3,Does what I need,This product does what I need. My only complaint is that it was smaller than I had anticipated so I needed to get another for the amount of things I needed to put in it.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this because of it's relatively low price. I've had similar products in the past and if you wet the suction cups they stuck to pretty much anything clean, flat and dry. I tried this on a variety of different surfaces around my sink such as metal, porcelain and counter top. I could not get this to stick to anything no matter what I did. I tried the suction cups both dry and moistened and it just doesn't stick. Not worth the money."
3,No Soul,"Listening to this c.d. kind of reminded me of earlier days at the roller and skating rinks and you know the merry go round. No liner notes to tell us any- thing about the artist. Some of the tunes (many) are kindda dated and best left in the vaults. It is kind of in the Earl Grant vein, minus Earl's nice pipes."
4,Wisdom,"Short book, with few passages, makes us think quite a bit to understand. It's a gate to start studying The Zohar; not too deep but also not too easy as the subject itself is far from light."
5,Amazing,"I have a very energetic lab, who is not yet two. She is very gentle and well mannered but when it came to walking on a leash, all rules went out the window. I had no control, she pulled so hard she constantly threw me off balance and would gag herself on the collar. I bought this harness after reading other positive reviews and I agree completely. It is very quick and easy to put on which is a BIG plus. My puppy doesn't even bother it. It instantly had her walkling without pulling her or myself. She still needs a little work b/c there is no slack between her and I, but there is also no physical pain for either of us. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!"
4,GOOD DANCE TRANCE MUSIC!,"If you like trance, you'll love this CD. This is also a great weight lifting workout CD."
4,"""always a standout among his fellow piers""","Can anyone on this planet not recall ""PERFECT COMBINATION"" (1984), the perfect duoStacy Lattisaw & Johnny Gill, still gives me chills when I hear it...ten five years later with""WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE"" (1989), another duet with perfection in mind, and youknow it still works...but the one that works for me is ""WRAP MY BODY TIGHT"" (1991), ispure funk with sexuality written in stone...another duet surfaced with ""SILENT PRAYER""(1992), this time with Shanice serves up a beautiful ballad sent from heaven.Total Time: 79:28 on 17 Tracks ~ Universal/Hip-O Records 314-584-274-2 ~ (2002)"
4,Not All By Himself Anymore,"Where in the world has Eric been for so long? It's nice to have him back, and this collection is a solid effort. The ballads, as always, are his strongest point and he offers some nice ones here: ""I Was Born to Love You,"" ""Someone That You Loved Before,"" ""Almost Paradise,"" and ""I Wanna Take Forever Tonight."" The uptempo tunes range from fun and inventive: ""Top Down Summer"" to contrived (""Cartoon World""). But the whole effect is nostalgically pleasant and conjures up memories of his great songs like ""Change of Heart,"" ""All By Myself,"" ""Never Gonna Fall in Love Again,"" and ""Boats Against the Current."" Don't stay away so long next time, Eric."
3,"NICE, BUT SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING","Anyone looking for a return to the power pop sound of the Raspberries will be disappointed. I might have preferred at least a return to the sound of his excellent ""Tonight Your Mine"" solo record. But, if your looking for ballads, this record certainly has it. Most are good. Some sound a bit repetitive. I am most surprised at how laid back the whole record is. By the time it reaches the end, a remake of ""Walk Away Rene"" is striking in its high energy level. A little more tempo and energy would have served nicely. In conclusion, this is truly the Eric Carmen record for the fans of the big ballad."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with the CD. Not the quality of the CD itself but Eddy Arnold's vocals. I guess I thought he would sound the same as he had to me years ago and, of course, he's aged and so has his voice. After first being exposed to his voice in my teens (showing my age) by listening and enjoying his original version of ""Cattle Call"", this version turned out to be a very big disappointment. I would try again and order another Eddy Arnold CD but I am a little nervous about trying to find a CD that recaptures Eddy's voice in its glory, especially after reading a glowing review on this CD and being so upset with it once I heard it."
1,Very Disappointed,"I have been an Eddy Arnold fan for 40 years. When I received this CD and played it, I became depressed. I, Eddy and Eddy's vocals have aged and none of us are as good as we once were. Extremely disappointed in Cattle Call. LeAnn did a good rendition but, I wanted to hear Eddy and his fantastic voice from years gone by. Sadly, you heard Eddy's age in his vocals. This isn't the only song that showed Eddy's vocals have deteriorated, most of the songs do. Eddy Arnold will always be one of my favorite singers but, not on this cd."
2,Eddie Arnold,"This album is awful. It's all the old Eddie Arnold hits you remember, but it was recorded by Eddie when he was old and the quality of the voice is just not there. It would be better to remember him like he used to be. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who really loves Eddie Arnold."
2,Seven Decades of Hits,"I really like Eddie Arnold but, very disapointed in this collection of songs......His version of ""Shenandoah"" (Across the Wide Missouri) is without a doubt, the worst I've ever heard."
3,Missing files,"The ""Live In-class Problems"" that are halfway done are only available to instructors. This book can be fully utilized if it is used by a instructor in the class, otherwise, a self learner would not have an access to the required files needed to do the end of chapter exercises."
3,Basic Excel Modeling Workbook,I purchased this workbook as part of my Corporate Finance MBA course. It was helpful for homework assignments and Excel shortcuts when analyzing financial calculations.
1,excel modeling,"I have returned this book more than 2 weeks ago but I have not seen credit on my credit card yet and sent an email while ago, and ask when I will get refunded but nobody really gave me any clear answer."
5,Concise but detailed book,"This book is fantastic to read and see pictures when you don't have time to read a huge chapter in the comprehensive text books. Love it, nice size that you can take anywhere."
2,Not for dancing!,"I was on the hunt for a great drum solo, with 2:00 time limit, and when I found heard the iTunes samples, I thought I hit a gold mine! I thought with 43 songs it was a great deal! Only to find out that each and every track fades into different songs after 15 seconds. I didn't understand what the purpose of it was, so I logged on to read reviews. Luckily, these drummers know the value of good belly dance music...and apparently I, like a past reviewer, need to start collecting the Jalilah full length cd's! I will be able to use this cd, but not as I hoped...wish iTunes posted a description or something. :)"
4,A great listen,This is a great listen for those who are into meditation or want something relaxing. I heard Autumn on XM radio and I love that song so much I went ahead and downloaded the whole album here. A great recommend.
2,Big book of old knife catalogs,"I bought this book based on another customer review. About the only pictures are on the front cover. This book is NOTHING more than various knive ads and catalogs from long past. There is no related history or collector insights. Indeed there is very little original writing in this book at all. Major modern manufacturers are not covered (Buck for instance) and like I said, there is very little additional information other than the catalog reprints. Knife values are kind of strange. My recent sales are as much as 4 times what is listed. Most are 2-3 times what is listed. I have noticed that other knife books are a little low also. There is no real help with identification in this book either. The only thing I liked about this book was the cover."
2,seriously lacking,"This book is seriously lacking, and incomplete. I can't imagine that the author spent a lot of time putting this together. Received the book today and returning it tomorrow. There are many books out there that are a lot more informative with more detailed complete information than this one"
5,John A Henderson MD,"Was the Trojan War a religious crusade against heretics and infidels? William Harwood portrays his narrator, Agamemnon, as believing that it was, although the economic factors that most historians see as the probable cause of the war are also shown as significant contrbutors. And while Agamemnon is depicted as a devout Zeus worshipper, one gets the impression that the author's view of religion is somewhat less than favorable. According to Haywood, the book is a demythologizing of legends, not an attempt to reconstruct what really happened. Probably his willingness to give free reign to his imagination prouced a more readable and entertaining book than if he had attempted to reconstruct actual history."
5,Sweet deal!,Great the used issue was a less then cm tear on the back cover let's just say it was kn better condition then new books I ordered anyways came super fast and was perfect I had never ordered a used book before and will now check to see what they have (I think it was under almost new conidition or whatever the highest option was) - super happy with the product and service
3,"I suffer from major allergies, so I really ...","I suffer from major allergies, so I really wanted to see what this product could do. The first time I used it, my eyes burned a little -- I think it may've been that I was out in the car and my eyes were already bothering me -- but after using it for a few days, I did see an improvement in the amount of burning and itching. I'd recommend these drops, even though I hate putting things in my eyes. I'd tried Visine years ago, and it did really nothing for me. But this, I'll use."
4,"Allergy season just started in my area, so ...","Allergy season just started in my area, so I welcomed the chance to Test Drive Naphcon Allergy Relief Eye Drops. They definitely helped to alleviate my itching, allergy eyes. I'll definitely recommend this product to my family and friends."
5,Airex AR-BB Balance Pad-Buy this product,"This is a great product and the price is the best I could find online. I received it within 2-3 days of placing my order, and it was not a special shipment. I recommend it-have used this product in physical therapy and it is great for balance."
5,Interesting product - simple but effective,"Found out about airex balance pads via my gym. this is a pricey item, but something so simple and effective. Couch potatoes can purchase and when you are watching TV just practice standing on it for balance. Then stand on one foot for balance. lift weights while standing on the pad. Use it to do lunges. I gave one to my exercise buddy and she and her husband fight over sitting on it while watching TV. lol they also use to kneel on when giving their grand daughter a bath. I like it!"
1,don't you hate,"People who write commercials and not reviews? I am glad the manufacturer is so assiduous in getting people to write 'customer' reviews.It's a decent pizza stone - people who have never used a pizza stone will like it, it does make a difference.But please, please, please can some tell these people that if they are gonna have their employees write in, at least vary the ""cookies, fish sticks....blah, blah, blah"" list of other foods you can cook with the thing? geez!!"
3,They keep breaking!,"I've been making pizzas for about thirty years and have yet to have a Sassafras stone last for more than a few months. They work fine at 350 degrees but pizza is better baked at higher temps. Seems to me that Sassafras stones must be fired at too low a temp or something. Anyone know where to get one that doesn't break at, say, 500 degrees?"
1,"And ""crack"" it broke","I loved the super stone. I raved to all my friends how perfect it cooked pizza. And then one day, when having friends over, I finally got to show them the true way to make pizza and the stone broke in 3 pieces. I couldn't believe it. I had only used it 10-15 times. And I thought I had something really good."
1,2 broken!,"We ordered one, it arrived in pieces. Ordered a replacement, and it broke down the middle after one use. Don't waste your money on this product."
1,Most disappointing,"Worked like a charm till it broke down the middle after only about half a dozen uses: The pizza made from scratch was almost done, and we heard a loud busting noise from the oven ... I am back to using my double-fired tiles lining the rack in the oven. Save your money!Zero star is a more appropriate rating. The rack went into the trash, the cheapo + flimsy pizza wheel is still around + keeps reminding me of this disappointing purchase."
1,"This one breaks, too!","I ordered this as a gift for my sister. It arrived in shards. Considering how thin it is, it's a wonder there haven't been more reports of breaking, like with Sassafras' other pizza stones. We will not exchange this for a new one. We will get a refund and try a thicker, sturdier stone. (Our 1/2"" stone has given reliable service for about 5 years.)"
1,Watch for the crack,"It works beautifully.Upon the 3rd use, I heard a terrible snap.The stone broke in half.Of course, I followed the directions.Perhaps it is just too thin for real world usage."
1,1. . .2. . .3 uses your out of a baking stone,We had a RECTANGULAR baking stone form Sassafras and loved it. It did not break under normal use. We had to replace it only after it was dropped on the edge of the sink. We thought the ROUND one would provide the same durability. WRONG!!! On the third use we suddenly had 3 baking stones but not a one we could use. I have never been more dissapointed in a kitchen product.
1,Sassafras baking stone 15 inch,"We have had our Sassafras baking stones for at least 7 years. We now have two of them, a 13 inch and a 15 inch. We just love them. We have never had the break on us. The SECRET is DO NOT CUT ON THE STONE!!!!!!!! The pizza should be slid off onto a pizza palet or something else and THEN cut into pieces. When you cut on the stone, you are scoring the stone, thus leading to its breakage."
1,"It breaks, you buy...again","We loved our pizza stone. We used it for rolls and tortillas and, of course, pizzas. That was, till it broke.We swear we read the instructions, and it didn't mention fragility anywhere - only that we shouldn't wash with soap in order to season the stone. Imagine our surprise when, crack!, it broke after fewer than 20 uses.I guess we'll buy a different one. But, man, we wished they'd said something before spending a year on this one."
2,I should have read more reviews before buying..,"I received my stone last week and made a wonderful recipe of baguettes and was very satisfied - until I tried to use the stone again. I followed all the recommended precautions, but the stone cracked right down the middle during the second use. I have sent it back for a replacement, but based on the reviews I just read, I don't know if I should have spent the money on returning it. If I have problems with the second one, I'll get a refund and call Pampered Chef and buy one of theirs!"
3,It's okay,"It's an okay training video. Good sections on dealing with dogs with aggression, but I didn't find the general training as helpful. I also bought Train Your Dog-The Positive and Gentle Method. That worked much better for us. The dvd is a little cheesy, but the dog picked up on the training immediately!"
3,It is average,"This is an ok video, it didn't address the problem I was trying to fix, but would make a good basic training video."
3,"""Big band"" polka music?","If you listen on headphones on a system with good bass, the effect here is a bit startling. Technically, there seems to be little stereo effect, as all the instruments seem to come from dead center. But there is plenty of reverb added, and the bass seems to come from everywhere, so the sound is spacious. One might call it a ""big band"" sound. On speakers, however, the effect is lost; the come-from-everywhere bass now seems tinny. This CD is OK, but there are better."
4,Revolutionary for my young self!,"I got this book when I was leaving girlhood, and entering womanhood. I had no idea of how to dress properly, and no clue about how my body type could affect what looked most flattering on me. I covers basics for all body types, such as tight fitting clothing makes you look larger, not skinnier, which was highly educational for me at the time. This book helped me a lot, because I new nothing about clothing or fashion, and I would recommend it highly for those just getting their foot in the door of better dressing. For those more attuned and experienced in fashion, there may be some information in there for you, but maybe not. If you have a daughter who refuses to see that wearing clothing that is too tight is unappealing, she may be convinced, as I was, by this book!"
2,Disappointing,"I had hoped that this would be an interesting book providing a new perspective on dressing if you have a ""Rubenesque"" figure, but it was just the same old bull about how you need to wear enormous shapeless clothing to create a ""flattering, slim"" silhouette. Note to the world: enormous, shapeless clothes do not make you look slim, they make you look enormous and shapeless. In addition, even though this book was published in 1999, all of the suggested outfits look like they're from the 80s. No wonder it's out of print. I am giving the book 2 stars rather than 1, however, because it does have some nice appreciative descriptions of body types that aren't anorexic models. At least it was a cheap book..."
5,Opti-Clean II,"Alcon - Opti-Clean II Daily Cleaner is the best cleaner for soft contact lenses. Nothing else works for me,and I have tried many. Most of them just cause my contact lenses to burn my eyes or else they just make my lenses foggy and I can't see out of them. Opti-Clean II is truly the best there is, and I haven't been able to get it at any stores anymore. Since I discovered that I can get it on-line, I am a happy contact wearer once again!Alcon- Opti-Clean II Daily Cleaner Performance Guarantee 2/3 FL OZ (20mL)"
5,One of Veloso's best albums...,"This live album perfectly captures the suave cosmopolitan charm and urbanity that Caetano Veloso brings to the world stage. In this largely-acoustic album, he sings old songs and new favorites, in Portuguese, English, Spanish and Italian (the disc is a tribute to Federico Fellini, recorded in Italy...) It's great stuff -- the music hits the perfect mood all the way through and Caetano, well... Caetano is a marvel. I think this is one of his best records ever... and I've heard them all. Highly recommended."
4,fantastico caetano,"I'm an italian fan of Caetano and i was surprised and moved when i discovered his passion for italian filmakers and for F. Fellini, whom I adore. This album is completely worth the great artist to which it is dedicated and it's incredible how artists who come from so different cultural background end by rejoining through poetry. Caetano's italian is lovely, but his neapolitan (Luna rossa) is absolutely delightful! Maybe it's not my favorite album by Caetano, but it's subtle melancholy, it's refinement and directness make it necessary to all the fans of Caetano (and of Federico)."
3,New batteries - maybe??,"I bought two ""new"" batteries - well maybe? One works like it should holds a charge for as long as the store bought batteries the other well not the case; really short charge life like 15 min maybe. I would say odds are in favor of at least one of these being rebuilt and not with the highest quality batteries. I have no yet had time to return the bad one so I can't comment on the return policy but I will be testing it."
2,too cheap-looking,"I bought this for my husband, and he wouldn't even wear it--he went and pieced together a more authentic looking costume. He did use the cape, which was the best part of the whole thing."
1,What a mess!,"Dear Amazon,the seller is good. No problems with delivery, punctuality and so on. I put only one star because the translation was brought very badly. The text is full of errors, computing errors. The edition isn't serious. They took a sort of ugly translation and printed a monstrous text without any practice and care. I repeat: the seller is professional. The mess is editor's fault.Bye. Alessandro Mussini"
5,Very informative book,"This is a very comprehensive book on peanut allergies. It is written for children, teens and adults who have peanut allergies. I was made aware of things I had not even thought about before. I also became more relaxed as I learned how to handle allergic reactions such as these. I highly recommend this book if you have a person who has peanut allergies in your home or not. This is an allergy that is becoming more prevalent and we should all be aware of how to protect and help those of all ages that have this allergy. If you yourself have this allergy it will provide much needed enlightenment as to what all the tests are for, what to be careful of, and what to do should you ingest peanut."
1,Not at all a helpful resource for herb gardeners,"Planning an herb garden, or just thinking about it? Do yourself a favor and get yourself ""Taylor's Guide to Herbs"" or another herb-gardening resource. This book has photos and rambling descriptions of different kinds of herb gardens, but there is very little defining information on herbs themselves. If you are looking for color photos or illustrations of different herb plants, medicinal/cosmetic/culinary uses of herbs, or even suggestions as to which herbs to plant next to each other, this is NOT the book for you. If you're a professional gardener, this is still not the book for you. However, if you are looking for a coffee-table book that suggests you are a gardener, then go ahead and buy this book. I'd give it a negative star if I could."
3,"""...Olivah, Dahling...""...[From Green Acres with love - unless you're a cop who pulls them over!","'Slap!', How dare you! Pity the poor Holly-weird cops who have to stop the Zsa-ZsaGabor(s) and Mel Gibson(s) of the world.Seriously, the story of three velumptioushungarian babes who escaped the Nutziesand Commies to come to America and make itin the world of film. Magda married one ofEva's ex-s! Good job by Biography exceptthat they left the best parts out.Once again, well filmed and packaged bynot complete. But I loved Green Acres!"
3,Okay...Not the best...,"This book was okay. It wasn't what I expected it to be. I liked the series a whole lot bette when Conner and Liz were going out. I don't get this whole Conner-Alana thing, it's as if it's not the Conner we've seen earlier in the series. It's actually irritating me how he turned mushy gushy all of a sudden (no thanks to Alana,who in my opinion is *blah*). My suggestion don't bother buying the book, just borrow it or something."
3,Good/disapointing,this book (like all of them ) was good. but i thought it was kinda dissapointing witht the whole conner n'Liz thing. I think that a lot of ppl would like to see them get back together . enough of this alanna [junk] anyway and who is jeff? really does anyone ACTUALLY care?
2,Not one of his best!,The movies here were not all that good. I was disappointed in them both and I am a die-hard Steve Martin Fan.
2,Essential? I don't think so...,"Odd little book with author Jones concluding that adding every porno ""Horror"" movie knock-off as ""essential"". The categorizing is totally random (listing A&C meet Frankenstin under ""Meet Frankenstein""??!) Strangely includes many sequels but omits the originals. On the bright side, there is some good info on actors of the genre, but all in all, skip this book! Dissapointing."
2,Hardly comprehensive,"Besides the fact that Stephen Jones sounds like he is not a big fan of the genre, his ""comprehensive"" volume excludes a large number of horror movies for the sake of including way too many ""erotic"" horror movies and horror cartoons. The fact that he has a low opinion of some of the most popular horror movies of all time is annoying, but I realize everyone is entitled to their opinion. There are instances, too, where I have read his synopsis of a movie and it appears, to me, that he clearly hadn't seen the movie. Even though this is one of the very few horror movie guides available, I can't recommend it."
2,not quite,"i did a fast skimming through this book and noticed that for an Essential Monster Movie Guide, it certainly doesn't praise or hype the genre that well. this book comes across like it was written by an elitist who's too good for horror. nearly every movie/special gets a low rating and i can't understand why a book like this that could've been a good companion to the horror fan would be so anti-horror as a whole. horror fans, in general, want to be be entertained and or scared...i for one don't want logical stories and things that make sense IF it detracts from the entertainment factor because typically what makes sense and uses logic in horror is BORING. it gets 2 stars from me because it offers a diverse selection of films and includes mini biographies of horror legends like Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Lon Chaney, Boris Karloff, etc. But for a horror movie book, the writers certainly didn't help their genre by bad-mouthing it so much in this book."
1,Essential? Pfffft!,"The only thing essential about this book is to avoid it.To begin with, the lion's share of entries contain little or no critical commentary, and what little there is, is banal.The book is preposterously inclusive in some areas...while ignoring many substantial films. Hokum and camp are generally the order of the day. Maybe that's the intent of the book, but it's not for me.It's a flip-through book rather than a good read, and one that will rarely be glanced at again... The book's attractive, clean format and reasonable cost (for a book of its breadth) are about the only things to recommend it."
2,The Essential Monster Guide to Porn...,"What's missing from this book?Well, Rosemary's Baby, Evil Dead, The Shining, Suspiria, the Godizilla films and countless other classics.What will you find?Well, Nude Nasty Dripping Wet Vampires, Cleopatra Queen of Bondage, the Rocky Porno Video Show, and the ever popular horror film: The Sexual Life of Frankenstein. At one point, a review even laments the fact that a movie doesn't have any sex in it! Perhaps, he should write a porn guide since that seems to be his main interest. He certainly doesn't like horror all that much.Oh and he includes such other popular 'horror' classics as: Three Men and a Little Lady, 21 Jump Street, Porky's II, and The Monkees (?!)The sad part is, Mr. Jones went more into detailed descriptions with the hardcore and the 'nothing to do with horror' movies and tv shows, than with the real horror movies. Get this from the library for a hoot, but don't spend money on it."
1,Extreme disappointment,Couldn't keep food hot for even two hours. The only time I've been disappointed by a Thermos.
2,not worth the money,"may be okay if you take it to a climate controlled office, but not much good as an outdoors job food jar."
2,Nissan lunch tote,"I was disappointed that the only contanier which has a seal is too small to hold much soup. If the bigger container sealed, it would work. The spoon is huge and in the way. If the thermos top sealed , it could double as a wide mouth thermos, alas it does not. It may work for Asian cuisine, but not so well for basic American fare."
1,Just not good enough,"Very disappointed with this product,48oz sounds like a lot,but most of the space is taken up with quite small containers (4).Only one of them is insulated and seals tight,one,the largest,has a lid that barely stays on,the other 2 are snap on plastic lids.Food,which was put in scalding hot,after preheating the whole unit,is only warm 4 hours later.I am looking for another thermos.For the price,a huge let down."
4,Good with a few faults,"Most of the other reviewers have covered the big issues with this lunch tote. Pre-warming it with hot water is a key step in obtaining satisfying performance. It is a mild inconvenience but I accept it; even thermoses must obey physics.The only disappointment for me is the leaky top containers. You will be tempted to put liquids such as soy sauce or salad dressing in the top containers because they don't tend to stay as warm. I was, even after I read the reviews warning against it. This is a mistake, as the lids are not water-tight. I guess I am spoiled by Tupperware, but I had anticipated that they would not leak.Other than that, the product keeps food warm very well, and is a cool piece of anachronistic lunch kit."
2,"A ""lunch tote"" is not a Thermos","A ""lunch tote"" is not a Thermos. I get that now. But I bought this thinking it was a 48-oz wide mouth thermos. It isn't. It's a cylindrical insulated lunchbox with little containers that fit inside. With a strange giant spoon. You absolutely cannot use the thing as a 48-oz thermos because it doesn't seal -- it leaks all over the place.It deserves one star as a thermos. But it is my fault for not reading closely. It doesn't say you can use the main container as a thermos, I just assumed that. So I give it two stars because I don't like it. If you actually want a lunch tote with fussy little containers, it may be a perfectly good product."
5,Great book-Great Guy,"Not only was I impressed with Coach GP when he spoke at our marathon (Quad Cities Marathon), but I was equally impressed with the book. It is written in ""his"" style and not the editors style. It only enhances what I learned from his speaking engagement. A definite plus for any level of runner.Hearing him speak was fantastic, but having the book at my fingertips to back it up is excellent."
5,great first book about wine,"This was my perfect first book on wine, after this one I can now chose and read the others. In particular guided tastings are what I will be looking for when I will dig deeper into any given continent, country or region. Main chapters of this book are the 4 or 5 most known varietals for white and red. This way at your own pace you get to know the basics. This book will also help ""red wine only"" drinkers to discover the world of whites and, why not, vice-versa. I also liked the fact the author gave excellent suggestions to save money where possible. There is also information on different styles (like sparklings or porto for example), accessories and basic notions (one getting closer to this world would need to know something about how wine is produced). Great hints on organizing guided tastings, purchasing at the stores or reading wine lists at the restaurants."
3,"Good, But Somewhat Too...","Good book, but somewhat too technical and detailed for a beginning ""Idiot"". However, the word complete, as in ""The Complete Idiot's Guide..."" is accurate. I bought this for a couple of novices, but they found it to be confusing and too much to learn in the beginning, so after a few chapters, they lost interest, due to ""overload"" and stopped reading. It was much more than the ""basics"". I would recommend this book for someone with a somewhat fair amount of wine knowledge, looking to add more detailed info to their personal data base. Good reference book on wine."
4,wine dummy,just a wine lover trying to learn more - was looking for temperatures of red vs white and the difference between each kind
4,Is that lipstick on my glass?,Best read with a soft long legged Merlot. It covers the basics and has added to my pleasure and thirst for the subject matter.
5,Greek Party-- A CD With Music You Would At A Greek Event,"I have the original record from which the CD was taken as well as the CD. This is a good example with all the strengths and the flaws of what you would hear at a authentic Greek Party in the United States whether it was 10 years ago or 10 days ago. While this is not cutting edge or classical Greek Music, it gives much of the joy and liveliness of popular music and is a nice addition to more heavy and more typical album initially made from cuts from more original artists."
1,Agonizing!!,"The Good""Tales of Ordinary Sadness"" is commanded by a fuzzy bend-heavy lick. From there the electronic percussion takes over. The up-tempo guitar heavy ""Shag Ball"" and drum effects heavy ""Pop It"" employ lots of sexual innuendo to try and draw you in. Surf guitar licks run rampant on ""Jet Set Boy"". ""Car Bomb Derby"" is a wild ride with its frantic pacing.The BadIn my opinion there are two major problems here. One problem is that despite the guitar laden tracks, the songs are more dance oriented due to programming effects (similar to your old Atari 2600). The second is that that the vocals are very whiney and annoying at times. Picture Kelly Osbourne meets Courtney Love. I still don't know if this duo is serious or trying to be comical.The VerdictAlthough pleasing to the eye, Electrocute is agonizing to the ears. There are a few decent songs, but after about half the album, you'll be ready to throw it out the window."
1,Trouble sleeping? This film will help.,"This one is a real yawner. A happily married man leaves his loving wife and young son for a business trip in Paris. There where every woman in town works as a prostitute, he repeatedly picks up the same one night after night. The movie is filled with long pauses where nobody says or does anthing except sit there and mill about. The sex scenes between Joe Dallesandro and Sylvia Kristel are good; but the director's lack of character development chips away at the film's ""tragic"" intention."
3,I think I am a bit to old for them,I am 10 years old. For younger kids it's all 5's. But get Legos not dubloes for your older kids. It is abousulty great for kindergartens. Even though I am 10 a still sometimes play with them.Lydiaage 10
5,Good for anyone age 3 to 103!,We have buckets full of Duplos and my children 5 and 8 have lots of fun building with them. They love to see how big of a building that they can build. We all get involved as a family! Hours and hours of fun!
1,Buy with Caution,"I purchased this product about 5 months ago, and followed all the company directions, for use and care, as provided by the supplier. Well, after just 5 short months of use the stone cracked while baking a pizza. I expected this product to last a lot longer. So don't say I didn't tell you so."
3,Great for cooking pizzas but hard to clean!,"I've had this pizza stone for some months now and I've used it a number of times. This stone is muhc more suited for a ready made pizza from the grocery store rather than a pizza you make from scratch. Also it's a bit small (but just the right size for frozen grocery store pizzas) and can be hard to clean, you have to clean it right away after the pizza is done. In any event, it's way better than a metal tray!"
5,This product is a winner!,"We have had our pizza stone since Christmas '00 and love it. We use it about once a week. The crust on a pizza cooked on the stone has a much firmer and flakier crust. We have had no problems with cracking. We store our stone in our oven. We preheat the oven with the stone inside, place the pizza on aluminum foil, open the oven and lower the assembly onto the hot stone. Pizzas cook evenly on the stone. With a foil barrier the stone needs no cleaning. It is easy to cut the pizza on the stone, too."
4,Getting Started on eBay,"This book focuses almost entirely on eBay. The truly authoritative Internet auction book would cover at least the top three open auctions (eBay, Yahoo! and Amazon) and the top three store auctions (egghead, onsale and ubid). That said, although this is more of a ""how to use eBay"" book than anything, it does offer great advice on online auctions, including the ins and outs of ""professional"" auction selling, and Elliot clearly knows his stuff."
5,haunted music,"How do you top albums like ""The Lion Is Loose"" and ""Sublime Illusion?"" For Eliades Ochoa, who has to be on the very shortest of short lists of the world's greatest guitarists (who's better?), you do it by digging even deeper into the rich soil of your roots: the sons of the Santiguerras. His ""tribute"" echoes with music generations old and yet as fresh as tomorrow. This album is different than any of his others: It has ghosts in it and a deep tug of ancient voices that brings it to another level. It is subtle, powerful, ineluctable. Buy this one. You won't be able to stop listening to it."
4,men robe,i think it is sooo pretty and my boyfriend loved it.. he wears it all the time.. i just think its a little too heavy
2,Lighted Peppermill,"The peppermill is great...performs as specified, and the light is fantastic for monitoring the amount of pepper dispensed, especially in low light levels. However, the attachment of the housing to the batteries is not up to par with the rest of the unit. I have had two of these and both have failed in that area. I have had the unit drop out of the housing onto my food. It would be better if the unit were made of metal instead of plastic."
4,Lovin Carnival Love,"Thank you Amazon for including this on your ""Best of the Year"" list. I certainly would have never been exposed to this wonderous CD on the stale playlists of radio or the repetitive videos' on VH1. This CD is for us who are 30+ and hunger for something intelligent and melodious. The life afirming ""Life is Beautiful"" is what the world needs more of. In a slump, just sing along to ""The Bike"". Each song is beautifully arranged with a variety of instrumentaion and the vocals and harmonies are A+. This is what music is suppose to be--transcendant and inspiring. Lets band together and support artists like Amy Correia to send a message to record companies and radio stations that we need more!!!!! (It worked for Dido!). Enjoy."
5,Album of the year,"Simply the best thing I've heard since Dylan's ""Time Out of Mind."" Discovered Amy when she opened for Richard Thompson in Atlanta; fully expect her to be headlining soon. Space does not allow a full review all of the outstanding compositions here, but ""Blind River Boy"" and ""Chinatown"" rank among my all-time favorites. But how can I leave out the instantly addictive ""He Drives It?"" Ms. Correia is a gifted a song writer and a blessing for an increasingly blighted pop culture; I await her next offering with eager anticipation."
5,Life is Beautiful!,"Amy Correia's debut album is a CD that everyone should experience. Amy's unique vocal and instrumental style is something I've never heard before from the standard female artists...she easily stands out on her own. Each song on this cd is either heartbreakingly beautiful (""Fallen Out of Love"" and ""Angels Collide"") or catchy and fun (""Daydream Car"" and ""The Bike"")...then you have the out and out masterpieces ""Gin"" and ""Blind River Boy"". Amy's voice is amazing and you should DEFINATLY catch her live if you have the chance!"
4,Amy on Conan?,"Ok, i think this was Amy i heard on Conan, what song did she preform...if anyone caught it??? Let me know"
5,"GORGEOUS SOUNDS, STORIES!","This is simply the BEST CD I've heard in years. This woman has amazing talent -- hauntingly beautiful voice and hot guitar. The song, the BIKE, is a fabulous song, with shining life force and complexity. Can't wait for Amy's next."
5,"Amazing, unique, and beautiful","Amy Correia is the singer/songwriter you always hope to stumble upon. Her voice is both unique and familiar. Her lyrics are honest and off-kilter, but in a good way. ""Life Is Beautiful"" and ""Starfishin'"" are two of the most beautiful songs I've come across in a while. And who doesn't like a woman with a ukelele? Though nothing can beat seeing Correia perform live, this amazing album is easily the next best thing."
2,Very Disappointing...,"This book is a real setback for lesbian fiction. The author fails to develop the characters. The story line is inconsistent and bland. The editing is pathetic.Xepher, the dark cop, seems too dense to ever solve a crime. Bri, the young medical examiner, can't get her mind off her libido. I would be incredibly frightened if the cops in this book reflected the capabilities of those who watch over my little part of the world. It's obvious the author did no research regarding crime investigation.I've read and enjoyed a great deal of Larisa's fan fiction on the web, but I must say this published book is very disappointing."
5,Susan Hayward and John Gavin great together in this movie.,"Susan Hayward is my favorite actress. This is one of my favorite movies she played in as well as ""I Want To Live"" for which she received an academy award in 1958. Would loved to have seen her get the role of Scarlett O''Hara, although Vivien Leigh did a great job as Scarlett. Definitely a chick flick! So if you like chick flicks you will like this one. So happy to finally find a DVD of Backstreet. Have no interest in the earlier version as Susan Hayward and John Gavin were perfect for these characters."
4,Warrior,This book was filled with two amazing stories. In the first story the hero was hot and the heroine knew what she wanted. This was a sensual adventure and a keeper.The second story has a hero that leavea you wanting more of him and the heroine is a strong willed woman who is not intimated by an alpha male. It's a keeper.
1,AMAZON LOST ON THIS ONE.,"lRECEIVED THE BOOK IN GOOD TIME BUT WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS SO CALLED HARDCOVER? IT WAS THE SAME SIZE AS A PAPERBACK , THE PAPER WAS POOR QUALITY AND SMALL PRINT. HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SATISFIED WITH AMAZON, BUT NOT THIS TIME."
5,Hoora;y for a story that was not full of drugs and oral sex,"The writing , especially the descriptions was exquisite. The characters all seemed very real and the story developed very well."
2,Disappointed,I was dissapointed with this C.D. I like 16 greatest hits better. I think people will not consider this a favorite. Sometimes A different recording of a particular song is put on an album which doesn't hold up to the original.
2,more like programming pre-DPMI,"If you are looking for LDT's, GDT's VDM's and all kinds of 386 protected mode goodies look elsewhere. This book is circa 1991, a better title would be interfacing 32bit C via Dos Extenders (ie Watcom386 8.0 & Pharlap)."
3,hmmm...,"This CD doesn't really do much for me. I love what hatebreed stands for and have the utmost respect for them however I just can't seem to get into their music much. There are some great tracks on this album but i just can't listen to this Album all the way through without getting bored. They are much better live. I prefer Throwdown to Hatebreed, however I hold nothing but respect for Hatebreed."
1,Poor Excuse For Music,"Hatebreed and all of these scream around bands are talentless and useless. Just playing instruments doesn't make you talented, and screaming around like a four year old having a temper tantrum sure doesn't make you gifted either. I had the unpleasurable experience of listening to this pathetic creation one day and I received a headache and thought that my ears were going to start bleeding. If I pressed play on a tape recorder, turned on a loud lawnmower and started screaming random words I would get the same result as this Hatebreed album. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Hatebreed, Mushroomhead, Slipknot and all of the other losers that are destroying rock music and spreading all of the goth..."
1,Please save your money,"This is nothing more than nu-metal trash. This isn't at all hardcore. First off Jamey Jasta is a fake. I seen these guys at ozzfest awhile back and I thought they were high school kids on stage. Second, Jamey has no self pride at all, hence yelling about hating everyone because he mainly hates himself. This man hasn't even been through much, unlike real hardcore singers like Freddy from Madball or even his brother Roger Miret who r both for REAL. Hatebreed is not what hardcore's about or atleast Real hardcore. Save your money and buy some real, truthful music from the streets like Sick Of It All, Madball,h20, cro mags ( real hardcore)"
1,no talent,"this band doesnt even deserve 1 star. i like 1 song, thats it. hatebreed has no talent whatsoever. the 'singer' cant even sing, all he does is yell. i mean, i know hard metal is usually yelling, but there is no variety here. everything sounds the same! i had to shut this cd off b-cuz it was giving me a headache. how can u call this music? i cant tell 1 song from the next, and this guys yelling is the same raspy tone throughout the whole cd. no variation, no substance. if u wanna hear GOOD music, listen to nirvana, koRn, system of a down, adema, disturbed, drowning pool, smashing pumpkins, stp, and i could name many more. hatebreed doesnt know the definition of talent, and neither do their fans!"
4,hardcore at it's best.,"this is my first hatebreed album. i'm just getting into the band. this is a good CD for the most part. it's relentlessly heavy and it will kick your [rear] the first time you hear it. 16 tracks of straight hardcore. my only beef with this band is the repetition. every song sounds the same. and the album as a whole is a bit too short. 16 tracks clocking in at less than 39 minutes. i wish the vocalist would have done more with his voice cos i'm sure he can. just a little bit of unexpected singing in the choruses or something. the lyrics are very angry and brutal. especially ""a call for blood"" which is my current favorite. a great CD to blast in your car or stereo but it would have been better had it been more diverse."
4,good album!,I think this album is realy good!!!Brutal METALCORE as it should be!!...also check Hatebreed - The Rise of Brutality!!!!
4,Haebreed's Best,"This ain't like the majority of the metalcore crappola. This stuff is definately worth it!It's true that many of Jamey's lyrics sound like he spent too much time watching corny afterschool specials while writing the material for this album, but while much of it is somewhat goofy a lot of the lyrical content is genuinely uplifitng and energizing. The music is as heavy as can be and is the audio equivalent to getting the tar beaten out of you. Definately recommended. This is some hardcore I can actually dig!"
3,"Solid, but not original","Hatebreed is doing what they do best, straight up brutal hardcore veering closely to metal. There are no big surprises here, no changes in style, no exploration of the genre, no pushing of limits. It's quite simply...Hatebreed. Everything you'd expect is here, crushing riffs, pit opening hooks, and catchy scream along chorus lines which have absolutely no tonal variation. One might wonder where Hatebreed is going with this. Hopefully they're not slowly digging into a ditch with lyrics that don't veer far from topics familiar on past albums and an unvarying singing style. Not that anyone is complaining, but the band may be repeating themselves a bit here and there. Maybe since they just signed a major label, they're doing what's safe to solidify themselves and then they'll start injecting a little creativity next time. Let's hope."
1,I'll say it loud and proud...,"Hatebreed SUCK. I'm just happy to see that others agree with me on this. It amazes me that some people prefer this crap to other very talented bands like Ministry, Cradle of Filth, Tool, and yes, even Korn. These and many other bands have a thing I like to call ""VARIETY"". Hatebreed have none, that is FACT, nothing anyone says can change that, they suck, that is final!"
1,Ummm...No f_death_metal from New York you're just a poseur!,"Hatebreed continues the trend of all mainstream hot topic kids who think they're oh so hardcore. The bands we named aren't recognized but that doesn't mean they aren't as good, or in most cases, better than your lame brained, wanna be heavy, bands. Hatebreed is one of those bands who wished they were heavy and well they really aren't. So f_death_metal from New York instead of telling us what you think we're doing f_death_metal from New York, why don't you take our advice and actually look into the band that the previous reviewers have suggested and you'll see that you truly are mistaken mr./or mrs. in this case, f_death_metal from New York. Never listen to that poseur, and certainly never listen to this poseur music. There are far better and heavier bands than this."
1,i wish i could give less than one star,"this band is the worst. you kids these dont know anything. i dont get you i beat the cum out of the dude that recommended this to me. this is not metal, is isnt hardcore. its baby stuff. and i dont care how many people i piss off. some one has to tell you. i got more talent in my lawn mower that all the members of this band combined. Jamie the babie jasta is lame. i would see joey gladstone and jesse and the rippers host headbahgers ball. he should be shot in his chubby chin strap."
2,comment,"No...Let me put this another way since it's obvious that most people here would think their taste in music is great when they appear to only listen to metal and at least one other genre (most likely jazz and least likely rap). If you are a hardcore fan then you will probably love ""Perserverence"". It has intense guitar-riffs and throaty vocals. The songs shift from one to another quickly and it gets old very fast.This is strictly for hardcore and metal fans. If you are anything else, don't bother.And please: don't say that you would like to think you taste in music is great when all you listen to is heavy metal. Not to say these are bad tastes in music but it annoys me to hear narrow-minded folk profess themselves as open-minded.Rating: n/a"
1,This [stinks].,"I bought this album because I was told that Hatebreed was an essential member of any hardcore fan's collection. Now, I may be wrong.. but doesn't a band have to be good to be considered essential? The songs all sound the same, the lyrics are terrible, the music is simplistic, but not in a good Sick Of It All way.I Hate It.Buy something else."
4,a little sludgy but great,"I picked this album up a few days ago and after a few listens Im very impressed. I wouldnt consider Hatebreed nu-metal even though I can tell they are heavily influenced by it. The screamer sounds almost identical to Corey Taylor of Slipknot. This album gets a little repetitive just like any nu-metal band with sludgy bar chords over and over but this one has something else. I think this is a good step up if your looking for more talent then slipknot, mudvayne, etc"
1,"Ultra-generic, ultra-cliché nu metal.","I know there are people out there who happily buy releases from a hundred different bands who all sound exactly the same, with no interest in innovation or originality or creativity. This one's for you, enjoy."
4,Solid Follow Up,"Hatebreed blew the hardcore audiances away back in the late 90's with their short but to the point debut Under the Knife. They showed their faces again with their strong Satisfaction is the Death of Desire. Now their third (or second however you see it) record was released about 5 years since Satisfaction. It is a very solid record. Good music, great lyrics, good vocals. It is musically sound. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because of a satisfactory mixing job. The bass is weak. When the bass drum is beat it is hard to distinguish its sound. Other then that, a great hardcore album"
5,Love this album and love this band,Every song on this album rocks hard. Probably my second favorite album of theirs. Buy it! You'll f'ing like it!
4,Best selling hardcore cd of all time.....,"Id like to start this review by saying if ur reviewing this cd from a ""metal"" viewpoint you miss the fact that this is a Hardcore cd through and through. Hatebreed our defiantly influenced by metal, but there sound i can better describe as a modern Earth Crisis who im saue had a definitive influence on these guys along with bands like Biohazard,sick of it all, and Madball.That being said ""perseverance"" delivers 16 tracks of metallic hardcore, each song thrashing up to a massive breakdown/pile-on sure to get fans stage diving/Dancing and shouting along every word. Jamey Jasta writes simple yet effectivily honest lyrics about life in general. compared to your average metal lyrics, yea u might not be used to this, but if you've been into hardcore this is nothing new, the lyrics are half the reason why we love the hardcore scenePerseverance i recommend to any music fan.....metal head , punk rocker, hardcore kid, hip-hop fan"
3,lyrically laughable,"Maybe two worthwhile songs on the album. The music is great - very heavy and intense. The lyrical delivery gets repetitive but is tolerable. However, the lyrical content is a joke. Imagine hardcore with lyrics that sound like they were ripped off from some cheesy 1970's after-school special, and you have an idea. If you like your metal evil (the way it was meant to be), steer clear of this band."
1,Dont Bother,"Dont waste your time with this album, wheres the art in this. They try so hard to be different than any band by screaming loud and hard as they can, if u want to listen to something from the new york hardcore scene go listen to Glassjaw, there's [some]talent."
5,Nothing less than PERFECT!!!!,"Of all the ""Hardcore"" bands out there, no one, and I mean NO ONE, is better than Hatebreed. And this I can say with great confidence. The production, musicianship, and all out aggressive ""Iron Chain"" of metal. I've listened to this CD 3 times already and I keep coming back to it. The vocals are just what hardcore metal needs: Aggressive and Raw. It has opened up my ideas as a guitarist. If you are a big fan of hardcore metal or are just beginning to listen to hardcore, you absolutely have to buy this album. It is, in my mind, the highest point in hardcore."
3,Good music but quit hogging the MiC,"Jamey Jasta should learn to shut his mouth and allow his band to play a rythem solo at the very least...otherwise the lyrics are good, the rythem of the vocals with the grinding guitars are good but, as I said, the band hardly has chance to play with out Jamey Jasta screaming over them.."
4,Hatebreed is still Solid,"Although in my opinion this is not as good as their very first album it is still pretty sweet. Jamey Jasta is one of the most talented singers in all of Metal music. The person who called Jamy Jasta a baby, and called Hatebreed a baby band is an idiot that probably listens to Maroon 5. my favortie songs on the album are, I will Be Heard, a Final Prayer, Hollow Ground, Smash Your Enemies, A Call For Blood, and Remain Nameless. By the way Hatebreed is not Hardcore music, Hardcore music sucks, all it is a bunch of emo crap with heavier guitars. If you are into bands like SlipKnoT, Mudvayne, Six Feet Under, Cannibal Corpse, Gwar, and Lamb of God get this."
5,What a gem of information!,"We were ready to buy a piece of land but were not exactly sure how to proceed. Country Properties showed us step by step how to make the right selection, hire a manager, maintain and establish the pastures for our cattle and horses and enjoy the rural setting with peace of mind! Everyone should read this reference book before they venture into the world of rural living and also buy a copy for your manager. He will really appreciate, use and understand these helpful hints! You will end up buying more copies for friends and family. This book is truly one of a kind!"
2,nice to know,"Nice to know Jesus died with the purpose to take everyone to heaven,especially for those that were in hell at the time He died.Unfortunately that stupendous truth isn't working out to well."
2,ben - 12 yrs old,"I read this book for a school report. It wasn't the best book I ever read, but the ending was pretty good. I would not recommend it to my friends. I think I was too young to understand it fully, I am in 7th grade."
4,If You Like Mysteries Then You'll Like This Book,"Teddy Camden and Ian Slater are best friends. One day Teddy doesn't come home and no one knows where hre is. Ian thinks Teddy left him a message but doesn't know who to tell, or who to trust because it seems like everyone he trusts is dissappearing. Teddy needs Ian to find him, but Ian doesn't know where to look. Also they think that Ian had something to do with Teddy dissappearing. I liked this book because it left you wondering so you had to read more. The thing I didn't like was that some of it was confusing."
4,A compelling and Important Read,"Treason & Triumph is fascinating slice of WW II history. It follows the lives of four people wrapped up in Churchill's effort to keep Nazi Germany off-balance vis-a-vis developing atomic weapons.Bonnie Toews has done her research and it comes through on every page. As she develops both characters and story, she takes us from the Spanish Civil War, Kristallnacht and the Battle of Britain into the center of the Third Reich.There are portions of the story that are difficult to read and digest, but they accurately portray the absolute bankruptcy of Nazi society.I truly appreciate authors who take the time to do their research and get their facts straight. Treason & Triumph also gave me a historical perspective on the entire race for the Atomic bomb that I had rarely considered--that being Great Britain's role in the entire matter.An enjoyable and interesting read. Don't pass this one up."
1,Self-Published Soap Opera of WWII,"In chapter two Winston Churchill talks about ""the atomic bomb"" in 1937 and the book runs downhill from there.The book is instructive to fiction writers because it contains multiple examples of clumsy and obvious exposition that books of writing instruction suggest you avoid. That no publisher was willing to buy this ms. is a caveat worth heeding."
2,Why is this rated so highly? Are only teens reviewing it?,"I admit that I'm only about 80 pages into the book so far, but it reminds me of a Harlequin Bodice Ripper, at least it's written with simpering metaphors like one (I read those when I was 9, but then I grew up).I've found two glaring spelling and punctuation errors so far, terrible in so few pages. (rings a sparkling on his hands?) a sparkling?? Geez.I'm tempted to just put it down and go on to another book, but the reviews have been so glowing that I'm wondering if this writer improves later in the book.I've read many great novels about the Holocaust/WWI era..this definitely isn't going to be one of them."
3,Interesting story,"The story started out a bit slow, but once it got going, it really got going! This story will definitely take you on a ride of wide-ranging emotions. The descriptions of life in war-torn Europe are very good; it's clear that Toews has done extensive research. In addition to the wonderful descriptions and emotions there is a well crafted mystery - there are plenty of twists and surprises. This novel will stay with you long after you've finished it."
2,Waste of Money,"This person may have a good idea for a novel but she should have found a real author to write it.I am amazed at the reviews here , are they all friends? did they actually read this book? I found this book so poorly written I couldn't get past the second chapter. Books like this one keep the vanity press biz going."
5,Riveting - a great read,"This book is a great read. It's a sleeper most would overlook, but once into the pages, it grabs you and holds you until the end. The dialogue moves the action and the action is a roller-coaster of surprises that will keep you turning pages as the plot rips along with murder, intrigue, double-crosses, and even a sex slave-something for every reader. This book is a riveting story incorporating historical detail of World War II. Well done, Bonnie Toews. It has my five-star recommendation.CAPT David E. Meadows, U.S. Navy"
5,Realistic and Riveting Classic,"There are books and there are books. There are authors and there are authors, but in our estimation, Bonnie Toews has authored a book that is and will remain a classic. She has truly created material for the movies. From start to finish, Bonnie takes her reader to adjective-filled literary composition that places the reader in the locale of the story. 'You are there,' only begins to explain the fascination of this novel. The only problem I had with the book, was that it came to an end leaving me hungry for more, more, more. Satisfy your hunger and whet your appetite with Bonnie's stellar word performance. I GUARANTEE THE SUGGESTION.. Treason & Triumph is a must, especially for those readers who experienced WWII.."
5,My son's favorite Mack!,"Apparently this was released during the last holiday season; I don't know how I missed that. Mack is my son's absolute favorite character and we have anything ""Mack.""This building set does not disappoint. My son is 3-1/2 and after I showed him one time, he could put Mack together by himself and even hunt for the right pieces among the other two Megabloks Cars sets which are all in the same bin.Once assembled, McQueen and Mack are both sturdy enough for normal play. It is obvious that Megabloks worked hard to design and produce these Cars sets to be as authentic as possible.Highly recommended -- if you know a Mack enthusiast, don't think twice to get this, it is excellent."
4,Lots of Options with this toy,"This was a gift for my son's 4th birthday. He loves it. He is able to take it apart and put it back together without the instructions and without help. Of course it's not exactly put back together as it was originally but hey that's all the more fun for him. He loves trying different construction ideas. He likes Mack's ""storage"" for whatever he's in the mood to transport. I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 becuase the it would be a bit easier to handle if the pieces fit together a little tighter. Still a great toy and a wonderful birthday present for a Cars fan."
3,My son loved this toy,"When he had all the pieces that is. Keep the instructions, you will need them to rebuild this guy over and over again. This was a great toy to give my son but soon all the pieces were hard to keep track of and that is sad because it was really cool when it was put together. The pieces are very durable, there are quite a few chocking hazard pieces in there though."
4,Kid Loves It!,"I got this for my 3 year old son. He's a huge ""Cars"" fan! I think it's actually showed him why Legos are cool because those Duplos he hasn't touched for months are one of his favorites! ;-)Not too difficult to build, easy instructions and a multiple play favorite!"
2,more of the same,"A surprisingly perceptive Amazon.com review gets it right: Andrew Weatherall's ""Nine O'Clock Drop"" is a far superior compilation of cutting edge late 70s/early 80s music. ""Machine Soul"" is a bunch of tracks, many individually good, with too many previously released on innumerable other compilations; as an ""odyssey"" it's a dud."
3,"Good, but could have been better",This is a hit and miss compilation of music. My only complaint is that there are two very important electronica influences missing here: The Crystal Method and Devo.
2,ludicrous,"It's difficult discerning just who this collection is aimed at. Covering 25 years, ""Machine Soul"" regurgitates a heap of old, vaguely electronica-related commercial tunes. Anyone with even a passing interest in the pop-electronica genre would have collected these tracks years ago. As for any others, there's nothing here that would remotely interest. It's a tragic title, too: there's no flow, nor relationship, between the tracks, suggesting Rhino thinks ""Machine Soul"" is some clanking, grinding monstrosity. With this release, they're right."
3,Puzzle?,This item is a model puzzle did not know that when I bought it for my six year old. After we put it together it fell apart lol.. Just my luck..
1,Disappointed,This model was small and cheap looking. It was intended as a gift for my grandson but I was embarrassed to give it.
2,cheap,"it is cheap stuff, does not look a bit alike as the picture. just a few plastic that already include the flags and all that."
3,Smaal and cheap model,"I wasn't really satisfied with this model. It was extremely small, so the pieces were even smaller. The hull didn't perfectly match, so that had to be fixed. The water-based decals were difficult to put on as well. Overall, it's a nice model to look at, but I wouldn't make another like it."
1,way too hard to put together,ok so I thought i was getting a simple model to put together....well was I in for a suprise.It has way too many litle pieces to glue to other tiny pieces....example...why is the mast in 4 pieces ..it is like glueing 4 toothpics end to end to end........why not one very sturdy mast...i gues i thought moderate skill level meant simple .....if it was a kid doing this alone ....i see big problems with all the little pieces.......maybe code the pieces on the plastic molds with paint colors so one could just paint everything on the handy molds before taking it all apart......
5,Prewarm the jar,"I have used 2 of these containers for the last year, and they have worked well. Things are kept plenty hot for atlesast 4hrs..(This is when my kids have lunch.) I am not sure if the poor reviews of this product reflect the users not following directions given in the owner's manual. You must heat the container before use by filling it with hot water. I think this is true for most containers of this type."
4,Kid perfect,I am very happy with the thermos. Now my kids will be able to eat hot lunch from now on. I spent too much money on other brands that would just keep the food cold no matter how much I followed instructions on the product. I followed the same instructions with this nissan product and the results are hot lunches for my kids. It is easy to use and very compact that it fits perfectly in any lunchbox. I highly recommend this product.
4,"But Dada is the whole point, isn't it?","David Mitchell is correct, in that this book reads like a dadaist assault on the very performance of literary criticism, but he misses St. Pierre's point.By consciously playing with derridean play, while attempting to address the importance of Barry Humphries' literary work, St Pierre manages to drag the whole piece over into burlesque and present himself as a consummate fan of Barry Humphries. In other words, the author clearly gets what Humphries was on about and carries it off in lit. crit. form.As for the book itself, I found it to be a reasonable read that presented me with insights into Humphries' work that I otherwise wouldn't have been exposed to. After all, one only really knows of Dame Edna on this continent, no?"
2,A Dada Trick,"With this exhaustive reflection on Barry Humphries' literary output, the author plays the ultimate Dada trick on his readers. It's absolute nonsense from beginning to end wrapped in pretentiousness and far-fetched and ludicrous hypotheses. Along the way he seems tho miss the point of almost every brilliant Humphries joke or utterance. Crazy, nutty and hypnotically wrong-footed. Roll up, suckers! The joke's on you!"
4,One Person's Journey,"First, the IMDB review offers a view that may be helpful to look at before watching the movie if you're the type who's not into abstract interpretative paintings. Thus said, the movie starts out with a young woman giving away all of the household and personal stuff in a garage style giveaway and then sadly taking off her wedding ring. Did she kill her husband; did he just die; did he leave? Who knows. Next she leaves her home in Amsterdam to hitchhike through Ireland. The movie shows the beauty of the country in counterpoint to her anger, sadness and loneliness as she walks, hitchhikes and camps as a solitary figure in that vast landscape. Midway through she finds an isolated widower farmer who tries to, in a patiently intelligent manner, bring her back to life. I say no more except in the end does she end up as she started?"
3,Somewhat helpful,"More Help!, another so-called indispensable guide to life for girls, really isn't all it's hyped up to be. Though it does have some good advice for girls, I found that the situations in the book were not ones that girls face on an everyday basis. Some of the advice, particularly on sibilings, friends, and homework, is quite helpful for certain situations. But some, like the ones on freckles, teddy bears, and roller coasters, are quite unnecessary. This book is a take-it-or-leave-it, definitly not an indipensable book."
2,A Lovely Book But.....,"I buy just about every Beaded Flower book that comes along and have some rare older ones. Also I have been beading florals in tiny beads for about 4 years. While this is a beautifully photographed book and the diagrams for instructions are very well done, I find that the recommendations for wire gauges for these compositions is to light to provide long enduring work. If you want to use this book, substitute her recommended 30 gauge wire for 26 gauge wire and 28 gauge wire depending on the weight and placement of your components. If you are going to spend hours of time creating beautiful beaded work, it should be of a construction that will provide you and your loved ones with many years if not a life time of enjoyment. 30 gauge wire will not do the job."
5,Fantastic Book !!,"I recommend this book to people who are passionate about making bead flowers. Clear instructions and illustrations to follow. Minako Shimonagase, please come out with more books, your work is Out of the World."
4,"Finally, a book about Phish for the rest of us","This book took a huge hit in the newsgroup, but the people who hang out there tend to focus on the specifics. This book covers the context Phish emerged out of better than the other books on the market. Plus, it's good Rock N Roll journalism, which means it most likely written on a tight deadline by a non-expert.Also, this is the first explanation I've heard of what ""David Bowie"" is really about. Recommended for anyone who doesn't have 200 hours, and wonders why anyone else would."
1,Farce,"This book is a farce. It is full of factual errors, from the careless to the utterly ridiculous. Mr. Thompson clearly does not know Phish. It seems that he was either hired by someone to write this piece of trash, or at least someone convinced him he could capitalize on the Phish phenomenon. Whatever you do, don't buy this book. Buy the Phishing Manual (Budnick), or wait for the Mockingbird Project!"
1,This book is terrible.,"Thanks to Dave Thompson for being another mediocre writer who was counting on the loyalty of phans to make a few bucks. SELL OUT. Do not buy this book. If you truly love the music and the history of this band, by The Phish Book which is co-authored with the band. If you are a fan from way back, or just getting into the band, open your eyes."
1,I can't believe this is still for sale!,"Go Phish has been ridiculed, to the point of absurdity, by scores of fans everywhere, including half a dozen on this page alone. For more accurate information, just make it up yourself -- since that's what Dave Thompson did here. It is more than inaccurate -- it is misguided and even delerious. There are other books about Phish - skip this one."
1,This book is a joke.,It is a crying shame that people are able to publish things they know absolutely nothing about. This book is not only a farce but poorly written as well. Not even worthy of bathroom reading.
1,Inaccurate fact-based writing? Go figure...,"Yes, I guess it's interesting to read, but this book is the perfect example of what's wrong with all the media's coverage of Phish- you have to be a true fan to get it; to know everything about them you have to immerse yourself in them. Buy Dean's ""Phishing Manual"", get yourself a Pharmer's Almanac, just don't buy this one thinking you'll get the whole story."
4,Fine introduction to the psychic Edgar Cayce,I highly recommend this video to anyone wanting to learn more about the psychic Edgar Cayce -- a truly amazing man.
4,I wish I could tell you,My son has all the other speed stars tracks but he has wanted this item since last Christmas and it is still out of stock here. I wish I knew how great I'm sure it is. -Angela
2,Night Shadow,"Alex returns home for some rest and relaxation, only to find that her small town has fallen victim to a series of brutal slayings at the hands of a mysterious stranger... Randolph Cohlan's first and only film is as horribly made as it is unintentionally hilarious. What little plotting that exists sets the film up as a murder mystery, but there is little suspense when the killer is revealed in the opening scenes. The audience also knows from the start that the killer is a werewolf, yet we are dragged along as the police fumble through each murder scene only to come to the same conclusion an hour later. NIGHT SHADOW is poorly scripted, and reads like a endless string of awful one-liners spouted out by a young Kato Kaelin and Stuart Quan. The creature effects and gore are satisfactory for the budget, but no excuse can be found for the jokey performances or talentless production.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
1,Very bad worth 1 Mic,Norfeest review was accurate the good beats have wack lyrics and the bad beats have okay rhymes. There are really no good melodies the Lyrics are lame and the beats are Indie.Only a couple of non sub par songs but by in large they were bad. It's a shame such a good group could come out with poop.Lyrics 5 Production 2 Replay 0 Entertainment 1
4,Airborn flyin' yo!!!!,"I just heard this album, and man, who woulda thought they'd get over on Beans! So, this LP packs heat - all that ill casio s**t is here on the beats, also some totally out-of-leftfield ish on some interlude instros! I thought I was contemplatin' buying lunar land at one point! I wonder if they can get any moer sci fi than this. My favourite cut is ""Monday Through Sunday"", heavy, heavy wordplay here by M Sayyid!!!! I hope they release some more singels..."
2,Crippled on beats?,With a mixture of incredible production and mindbending wordplay Anti-Pop Consortium has been one of my favorite hip-hop groups for years. While the deft lyricism makes the transition to Airborn Audio it sounds like the duo from Anti-Pop have taken two steps back with regard to beats. Plodding drum sequences and repetitive choppped-up syths limit this album from being noteworthy.
4,Free Hip Hop?,When I first got this CD I hated it. I would have compared it to a mainstream Cd like 50cent or Mike JOnes. I thought that I would never like it. Here I am listening to it. This CD is for a true Hip Hop fan. This Cd is as experimental as it gets. This Cd can be compared to Free Jazz. It is so out there that it will take a couple of listens to like but if you appreciate Hip Hop as an Art and not as just entertainment then you should listen to this CD with an open Mind.
1,Still....a broken wire,"Since the reviews about broken wires were both written well over 1-2 years ago, I thought surely the problem had been corrected. Why would a company continue to sell a broken product? Well, apparently this company is perfectly fine doing just that! Like previous posters, the wire on my board arrived broken. There is no damage to the packing, so it is not a shipping issue. I ordered this product for a Superbowl party in a few days. Obviously I cannot use it. I haven't been able to find a number, just an address, so I can't even complain about it today. DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!Amazon...wake up and quit allowing your customers to buy this item. It reflects poorly on you."
4,Cheese Tray,"I had a cheese tray, but it didn't have room for crackers. I had to put the crackers on a separate plate. This tray was just what I was looking for. In some reviews, people mentioned that the cheese cutter did not arrive aligned correctly. Mine was fine when it arrived and I have not had any problems."
4,Snacker CHeese SLicer,"Fantastic for having your cheese and crackers, at the same time while watching television, and/or playing games, like me! Great deal. Great for cheese and cracker lovers. Buy one, you'll love it. And your couch potato will love it, too!"
5,"Nice cheese tray, arrived in good condition","Arrived in good condition, no broken wires. I have enjoyed my previous Prodyne cheese slicer, this adds the cracker well. Recommended, and at a good price."
4,Great gift,The person who received this as a gift appreciated the separate section for crackers and the cheese slicer. Great gift for anyone.
4,Pretty nice,"I have only used this a couple of times. It is nice and looks like the picture. I bought three for presents and had to adjust the cutting wire on all three. Sometimes it needs adjusting while using it. This part I don't like, but it does do the job."
4,Why has everyone forgot about this incredible band?,"I was as floored as anyone once I gave ""Where Have All The Merrymakers Gone?"" a listen past ""Flagpole Sitta."" When your only popular single can easily be among the worst songs on your debut, the public as a whole seems to be missing out. ""King James Version"" hasn't even got that much respect. Nelson's lyrics come out as strong as ever in one of the best rock albums released that year, and if any band deserves more recognition its Harvey Danger. Unfortunately, this has to go in to that infamous category ""Best Band You've Never Heard."""
3,"Not as good, too bad","We waited too long for this album and unfortunately it isn't as good as the first one. Perhaps if it had come out first with nothing to compair it to it would be better. My favorite is ""Pike St/Park Slope"" which is absolutely beautiful. But there are no songs that compair with ""Carlotta Valdez,"" ""Wolly Muffler,"" and ""Problems and Bigger Ones."" It's not a bad album and for the true Harvey Danger fan, I would say - go ahead and buy it, but don't expect too much. If you liked ""Sad Sweetheart of the Rodeo,"" go buy the first album!"
3,Aw...,"I was taking a risk when I bought ""Where have all the merrymakers gone?"" but I was pleasantly surprised by one of the best CDs I own with his somewhat nervous, small, and nerdy voice, but backed up by beautifully contrasting hard rock that beautifully accompanies the feeling of the songs, while squeezing in some sarcastic humor. So, I continued to buy King James Version and no matter how many times I force myself to listen and love the album, it just doesn't work. Harvey Danger sounds like somebody who would call himself Harvey Danger, suddenly bold and swingin' but I can't see in these songs the band that I saw live nearly collapsing in effort to create some great sounds while smashing the mic stand into the ground. I think my mom would like it."
4,Niiiiiiiiice,I loved it . Youll love it too. Got a dash of country in there I think. The second half of the cd is the best
2,Harvey Danger Lets Me Down,"I can honestly say I was looking for huge things from this album. I loved the first album and thought it was incredibly witty. This one's witty too, but the music behind the lyrics can be considered boring at many times. The radio single sad sweetheart harkens back to the good ol' harvey days, and it's one of the album's best. Authenticity rocks as well, it is funny and catchy. the loyalty bldg. is ok, and the pike st. song is an unexpected turn from the band and has grown to be one of my favorites on the album. The rest cannot be distinguished from each other. Save your money, buy a Weezer album or check out caviar or roger clyne and the peacemakers. This album has 4 or 5 good songs, tops."
5,Awesome!,This album has everything that the first album has but more! I love this band and this album is more than I would have ever expected from anyone else. In one word...awesome!
4,Great Sophmore Record,"HARVEY DANGER is back, with a feistier, wittier, and better alum than their enjoyable debut WHERE HAVE ALL THE MERRYMAKERS GONE? KING JAMES VERSION starts off with the near-perfect SHOW ME THE HERO, in which they channel the Pixies, and which is my personal favorite of theirs. Other top tracks are HUMILITY ON PARADE, SAD SWEETHEART OF THE RADIO, the current radio single, ATHENTICITY, PIKESTREET/PARKSLOPE, THIS IS THE THRILLING CONVERSATION YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR, LOYALTY BLDG., and UNDERGROUND."
2,Same whiny sub-pop try to be Blink 182 crap!,"This band is just like every other band out there. They say they're punk rock, but they don't know what punk rock is. I'm getting tired of this band, I used to like them, now I don't. I'm starting to like real bands, such as the Dead Kennedys, the Melvins, the Meat Puppets, Sonic Youth, Nirvana, the Beatles, and the Butthole Surfers. This music is a waste of your time and you should pick a better band immediately!"
4,Danger by name...,"A long time coming by today's standard of strike while the iron is hot remixes and 2nd rate follow ups, Harvey Danger brings together another mix of not-sure-why-but-I-really-like-it. Their first album seemed a possible one hit wonder, but that was mostly because there was no sound alike to the first to follow up with. I fell for them with the charming ""Carlotta Valdez"" opener to ""Where Have All The Merrymakers Gone"" that made me go out and rent ""Vertigo"" again.These guys are good, the songs stick in your head, and you'll be sorry if you don't buy it soon."
4,It's pretty good.,Amazon won't like me be quite as concise as I'd like.The category most people probably put this in is 'collage' (I guess ...). I doubt most like it as much as R.E.M but I think I might and it usually makes it to the playlist when I'm in an 'REM' mood.
5,Too deliciously clever for its own good.,"""Pike St./Park Slope"" is the real masterpiece here, so it figures that the song would be panned as deadweight on the album. Sean Nelson is arguably the sharpest, most intellectual songwriter alive today, at a time when irony and wit are viewed as carcinogenic. Nevertheless, he and his bandmates put together a superb album and as their reward were ignored by shoppers from sea to shining sea. ""Meetings with Remarkable Men (Show Me the Hero)"" is the would-be hit that never reached the airwaves, while ""Why I'm Lonely"" is uncommercial and beautiful. Most of the songs here speak to the everyman who remembers such arcane details of growing up as waiting for his mother to finish with her business in a carpet store. All right, so the everyman holds minority status in the world today. Accordingly, he should find ""King James Version"" all the more comforting."
1,Makes a good paper weight,"Fellows must be having quality control issues. As other reviewers have experienced my shredder showed up dead on arrival. No lights, no sound, wouldn't turn on....nada."
2,Not what I thought.,Does not work as expected. Shredder is slow and jams. I do not recommend this product.
3,It's just ok.,"When my old Fellowes shredder broke after 2 years (because I tried to shred some adhesive shipping tags and they wrapped around the axle), I decided to buy this model, especially since it appears to have a hole in front for regular garbage. Now I don't need a shredder and a trash can in my office, right? Wrong. The picture is misleading since that space in front is actually blocked by a clear plastic plate.Finally, this motor seems very noisy and underpowered. Shredding just one sheet changes the pitch of the noise, and shredding more than 3-4 sheets at once makes it sound like it's about to fail (though it hasn't).I would rate it even lower than 3 stars, but it looks good, has a nice safety feature (stops if touched, great because I have pets), and compared to the models I saw at OfficeMax, it was the best choice."
4,Good shredder,This is a good shredder. It can shred up to 5 pages at a time. Definitely good for personal items but might not work for a home office. It also makes a lot of noise.
3,Fellows Shredder,"Fellowes 32057 Powershred P-57Cs ShredderI have only had this product for a short time therefore I can not rate it because I have not learned it personal performance status. However, it appears to be working fine at this time."
1,Fellowes 32057 Shredder,"Great home shredder works well , If you have a larger amount of shredding to do you would be better off with a little bigger one."
4,Works great but...,"Great paper shredder but I thought it was going to shred stuff into smaller pieces, shredder is great but it cuts paper into strips. shreds credit cards and paper 8 at a time no problem. good product i just want smaller clippings"
3,Not as powerful as stated by the manufacture,"I've used the shredder to get rid of a few thousand documents, and have found it to be reliable, but not as powerful as stated. My shredder won't shred more than four sheets at a time, and if I try to shred more than a few sheets consecutively, it won't handle more than two sheets at a time without becoming overloaded."
3,Just Okay,"This machine is for 1-2 pieces of paper at once. So if you have a business or alot of things to shred, this is not the way. It's good if you want to shred your junk mail on a daily basis...but I wouldn't let it all build up or it will take FOREVER to shred."
3,ok shredder,"This shredder is just an ok machine! Nothing really stands out to me.I doubt that it will do 10 sheets of paper as advertised. Works for general purpose, but dont try more than three or four pieces of paper.Anymore than that and it seems to drag. Will keep but no what i thought it would be."
4,Fellowes Shredder,"The only reason I did not rate this product a 5 is because it claims to shred up to 8 pages and it struggled shredding 6 at a time. Other than that, it is very sturdy and shreds well."
4,"Good product, still going strong after 2 years!","This is the 3rd or 4th shredder I've owned; they all seem to break around the 1-year mark. I bought this shredder after considerable research, and am very happy with it! I've used it 4-6 times per week for about 2.5 years now, and it's still working great. However, I only shred 1-4 pages at a time. It makes an unpleasant noise if I try to shred more pages than that at a single time, and I'm afraid it may break/jam. I think a major reason this shredder is still going strong in my house is that I oil the blades each time I empty the container. I just take a sheet of paper and drip some regular vegetable oil from the kitchen onto it, then feed into the shredder. Turn on the reverse function for a few seconds, then run a dry sheet of paper through to remove excess oil. Simple enough - and I think it makes a big difference in performance. I would definitely recommend this shredder."
2,Not as good as adverstied,"This shredder does not do well with more than five sheets. It advertises 8 sheets. It jammed the second time I used it. I was able to get it unjammed after 10 mins of work. It's is better than some of the 30 and 40 dollars shredders you might find at a discount store, but not suited for a home office. You can't shred your credit card soliciations unless you open them up and feed each item separately. I say go with a more robust model if you shred more than 20 pages a month."
2,Not for people who get a lot of spam mail,"This is a good product. No doubt about it. But is it good for people who want to just get rid of their spam mail as-is without even opening the envelope? I don't think so.I think the 8 sheet rating applies only when you insert 8 unfolded sheets of paper. I tried with 2 sheets of paper folded twice (8 layers) and the shredder choked on it. That is why I say that it won't be useful for people who want to shred their spam mail fast. Even though the REVERSE function gets rid of the Jam, what is the use of buying an automatic shredder if it cannot handle what it is advertised to do?I have returned the product and am planning to go to the local Fry's or Office Depot to see shredders in action. It is too painful to order something this big online only to return it within few hours."
2,Doesn't perform as advertised,"I don't understand the high reviews. This shredder will work fine only if you are nice to it. While the advertisement claims it can shred eight pieces of paper at a time, this is completely false. I can only shred two or three pages; all junk mail must be opened and unfolded to be properly shredded. There's no way I'll attempt to run a credit card through this thing. The shredder is way underpowered, yet it still manages to be incredibly loud. It also weighs around twenty pounds. The power cord is ridiculously short. So far it's still working, but I'm not happy with this purchase."
4,It shreds,"it works.shreds you average daily delivery of junk mail quite nicely.the sensor is a nice feature.the top is a pain in the rear to remove from the bucket... which blows given the piddly micro-safety switch they buried in there.otherwise, it's OK. runs on 110/120V and not a plug in transformer, so it pulls some current.nice soft start and soft slow down (makes sure it shreds to the very end).like it."
1,Disappointing,I chose this shredder based on the reviews here. I don't know if I just got a lemon but I am very disappointed and want my baby shredder back! It constantly stops in the middle of use and I mean with only 1-3 pieces of paper. I have to wait until it stops completely to put in more. My old one you could continue to add more while it was going. It stops in the middle and you have to reverse it to get it going again. I thought I was upgrading but think it is a downgrade. If it weren't for the cost of shipping I would return it.
5,"I shredded 2,000 pages in 1 week!!","Went paperless with this product and the Fujitsu ScanSnap 510 (Awesome product too!). Scanned everything I had double sided into searchable PDFs, then shredded them with this Fellows P-57Cs shredder!I'm not sure if you're supposed to do this, but just to give you an idea of how rugged this thing is I shredded about 2,000 pages in a week. I kept it well oiled every time I emptied the bucket. I would shred 4-5 pages at a time, and fill a bucket with 75-100 pages. I then let the shredder cool down (couple hours) and repeat.Notes:- Seems to do best with 4-5 pages- It's somewhat noisy. Not real loud, but not quiet either. I kept it up on a chair (off the floor) so I wouldn't disturb the neighbors living below me. The noise/vibrations seem like they can go through the floor.- I recommend buying the oil for it too, and use it every time you empty the bucket- Sensor is cool and works well. My fingers are too big to go through the slot anyway though."
4,A good shredder for a good price,"For light home use, this is a great shredder. You have to stick to the page limit, but other than that it is very appropriate for home use."
4,Plastic gears are a problem,"This is a great little shredder for the money. I had mine for 8 months before it broke -- truth be told, I was trying to cram way too much stuff in there when it broke. I took off the top and saw that I had sheared off the main gear, which was made of plastic (which makes sense given the price).This would be a real easy fix -- just swap in a new gear -- but in contacting Fellowes, and in doing a number of Interent searches, replacement gears are not available. Fellowes replaced the shredder because it was still within its one-year warranty, which is great (and Fellowes customer service was great), except that now I have a broken shredder that will wind up in the landfill, when it would be such an easy fix. And that's not so eco-friendly.Anyway, the short of it is, great personal shredder, but with the caveat that it's made with plastic gears for which Fellowes has no replacement parts available."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this shredder. It did not turn the sheets into confetti. It is only one step above the old strip shredders. I gave it away, and went to Staples and purchased a shredder that cut the sheets into confetti. The cost was only a few dollars more. If I sent it back, I would have had to pay the shipping. (both way, because shipping to me was free) I would have net of $20.00 refund."
1,EXPLOSION ... FIRE!!!,"AS TITLE STATES ... WHILE SHREDDING MOTOR EXPLODED AND CAUGHT FIRE!!! Fortunatly quickly unpluging doused the flame and kept the waste basket from catching fire. From day one, never have been able to shred more than one sheet of paper at a time. The unit is noisy, jams continuously, runs when it's not supposed to ... It's not like I'm a high volume shredder. Used very little at home to shred PAPER ONLY! DO NOT BUY!!!"
2,Highly Rated? Not in my book..,"This unit was highly rated in it's class(inexpensive). I would hate to try the other ones! Of course for home office use, I can't justify a unit in the $100/$200 range.Advantages:1) Does a very good job of shredding the documents.2) I am trying to think of something else but it hasn't materialized yet.Disadvantages:1) This unit is way too loud. You almost need hearing protection.2) My old shredder had an opening so I could throw in things I didn't want to shred, this one doesn't. Now I keep a wastebasket under my desk, as well as the shredder.3) No way this unit shreds 8 sheets at a time, 4 at best.Note: I haven't tested the safety mechanism so I can't comment on it."
4,Pretty darn good!!,"First off...this item showed up two days after I ordered it. Two days!! I certainly expected it to take much longer than that...WOW!! Secondly...it's a really good shredder. I don't know about the whole eight pages at a time thing - it struggled quite a bit with three pages. BUT...I had a laundry basket (literally, a laundry basket) FULL of items needing shredding. I worked this machine for at least an hour and a half...without rest. It never overheated or slowed down on me. That's way more than I can say about other shredders I've used. I do recommend it for sure...it's a great price for a great item."
3,Not bad for the price...,"I love the way it chops the paper (crosscut)...but it isn't very powerful. It bogs way down with 3 to 5 pages...almost to a jam. Has a tough time with Credit Cards. I would recommend for very light office shredding but the way mine runs, I don't anticipate it lasting very long."
5,Fellowes Shredder,Since my purchase this shredder has been very easy to use and has far exceded my expectations.
1,not so good,It jammed with the plastic credit card that came in the mail with credit application. Since I don't have any paperwork on it - I'm screwed! I might buy it again though since it seems to handle multiple pieces of paper pretty well. I would have liked to have known whether or not it took plastic cards before I tried it! Had to junk it!
4,Great shredder,"I got this for my husband, he put it to work right away...great shredder for the price"
4,Not true confetti,"This is overall a great shredder if you can get it on sale at a deep discount. The reason? I was looking for a confetti shredder because that is the most secure you can buy. When I got it I had to check the box before I understood what their ""confetti"" style really was and was very sorry that I didn't look at another reviewer who stated the same. This is not the type of confetti you can expect to throw up in the air, not the same small box style pieces. Do not buy this if your looking for true confetti. I gave it a four though because it seems of great quality and great safety features."
3,not a bad shredder,"Works pretty well. Would have liked the pieces to shred a little finer, but overall, not bad"
4,IT'S GREAT!!!,THIS PRODUCT WAS GREAT AND I LIKE IT. THIS PRODUCT WAS PERFECT FOR EVERYONE. ALSO IT SHREDDING PAPER AND PLASTIC CARDS FAST. THIS PRODUCT WAS EASY TO HANDLE TO USE. BUT IT'S HEAVY WHEN I CARRY. ANYWAY IT'S GREAT.
4,It shred's,"Works fine fine for light to medium work. Didn't seem messy light the other comments suggested.I thought I was buying a confetti shredder. It doesn't. But thats my fault for not reading throughly.If you need to do some heavy work, then look for the next model."
4,Fellows P- 57Cs,I have had the shredder for approx one month. When I first set it up it did not work but Fellows promptly sent me a new cannister which corrected the problem with the safety switch. From that time it has been working correctly with no problems. Note you will need the oil which is needed for the cutting knives for regular maintenance.Peter
3,A Fair shredder,"This shredder maxes out at about 4 or 5 pages a time. It is a little sluggish. I think the the strips are too wide for identity theft protection. If I could afford it, I would have bought a higher end model. I paid $50 for this one, but I think it is worth $35."
3,Does the Job-Medium Duty,"I am pleased with this shredder. It would be nice if I could drop unopened envelopes into it...but for the money I am OK with what it does.I suppose the worst thing about it is its NOISY. However I can live with that. Also it will overheat if you use it for more than 7 minutes straight. No problem for me. The bin fills quickly but I can put the shredder onto other trash cans. It shreds into confetti pieces, it is very fast and it takes 4 pages easily. It sounds like its struggling with 6 but it does get through. It says it does CD's and credit cards...I wont try a CD but the credit card went through. As long as you have time to feed it little piles, I would say you would be happy."
2,underwhelmed,"Unable to shred more than 3 thin sheets at one time, despite claims of up to 8. Serviceable enough if one doesn't have a large amount of docs. to process. Good for the occasional home shred of old bills, envelopes and mailing labels, and the unwanted cards sent."
1,Disappointed in Performance,"I have had this Fellowes P-57Cs shredder for about two months now.It indicates it handles eight sheets at a time.I do not agree. It handles about one letter-sizedpaper at a time; and if you want to shred two sheets, itis wise to rip them in half before shredding.Overall, it is an OK product, but not great.No, I would not recommend the product for medium use."
2,Not very good,"After using the product several times, the electric motors starts to drag as if there is not enough power or torque to shread the paper. I had bought this item before I visited Sam's Club they had larger shreadder for $100."
3,You get what you pay for,I think this product is not bad but also not as good as other reviews make it sound. The 7 page max cut claim is pushing it very hard (more like 3 maybe 4)unless you want to strain the unite. Dont get me wrong the unit did cut 7 pages at once but now it works very much slower than it did before that cut. The credit card cut process has become very much a strain on unit since I tried 7 page cut. Overall you get what you pay for I just wish it was promoted as 5 page max cut not 7.
4,decent for the money,"It's a pretty strong device for the money. I shred oodles of stuff each day.I was only hoping it would take the the whole enchilada at once, you know those danged credit card offers? Well, you have to remove the paper from the envelope and give that it's individual shredding.On the whole, I'm pleased for what I spent."
3,Great home office shredder,"This shredder is top quality and just perfect for the home office. When emptying the shredder it can get a bit messy till you figure out just how to remove the top part from the shredder. Perfect for the home office, I now have 1 bag for recyling of paper and not 3 garbage cans full. Plus my identity if now safe."
2,Marginal shredder,"The Fellows P-57 Cs Power Shredder doesn't have the power I expected. It does a good job of making large confetti, but can't handle more than 3 or 4 sheets at a time - it stalls, gets hot, and stops functioning when grinding a batch of more than 15 sheets, even doing 2 sheets at a time. It's barely okay and I would not buy another - get one with more power and capacity."
5,Excellent Shredder for the $$,"We had 2 other paper shredders that frustrated us to no end, when my daughter recommended this Fellows. My husband is in his glory with this new gadget. It shreds a lot more at one time than our other two shredders combined and we the the sensor to be a great feature as well.No complaints; recommend"
4,It shreds,"It's a shredder and it shreds. There is some hesitation when you stick more than 2 sheets in such as when shredding junk mail without opening in. That would be my only complaint. I hate having to open the junk in order to just shred my name and address but other than that, it is a shredder that shreds."
4,so far so good,"In terms of size, I didn't realize how large the shredder was until I received it. It's the size of an 8 gallon garbage can. I was used to a smaller shredder. As for performance, I liked that the shredder was quiet. It struggles to shred the maximum number of pages. Like the others, I'd recommend shredding just a few sheets at a time. Overall I'm happy with the purchase and hope to see this one last at least a few years."
1,Total Failure,Item was returned due to the fact it could not even shred one sheet without over working motor.
4,Shredder Review,"The Fellowes P-57C shredder works very well in my home office. My only complaint would be the machine does not like more than two, perhaps three pages at a time. While this is less than advertised capacity, it is not a major problem, since I seldom shred large volumes at one time. The machine is much quieter than my previous shredder."
3,"Good, but...",The item arrived quickly and works fine. My only complaint is that when I received it the box looked like it had been kicked to my door from the warehouse rather than driven. The box really made the item look trashy and it was a christmas gift.
5,very good,This shredder is a real good buy. The shredder works great and I am satisfied with the quality and the price.
3,And go light on the vegetable oil,"I used 6 - #20 pieces of printer paper and it jammed. My shredder will do 3 pieces, but I put in 2 and it works fine. Good for someone that needs to shred mail and other very light tasks. Don't shred sticky stuff and go light on the vegetable oil. Next time I'll go heavy duty."
5,"Great shredder, but you must use a little common sense","I purchased this shredder a couple of months ago. I did quite a bit of research before deciding on this one. I think it is the best you can buy for the money. The description says it will shred 8 sheets at a time. The most I have done is 4. I would not try to run 8 sheets through any shredder. I have also used it continually for 5 minutes , without a problem. Great shredder for home use but ,as with anything, you need to use a little common sense when operating it."
2,Disappointed,"I chose this item because it was a Consumer's Reports best buy. It is supposed to shred 8 sheets at a time, but will jam with 2 or 3 sheets if they don't go through straight. It can't be run more than 5-7 minutes at a time. It will over heat and cut off if run longer. It requires expensive oil. In addition, it is very difficult to get the shredder head just right on the basket and it won't run unless it's in perfect position. It also is not to be used with self-adhesive labels such as those on charity solicitations. It does have a safety feature that will cut it off if a hand comes too close to the intake slot. Over all, while it does shred safely, I am disappointed in the limitations of this shredder."
3,Simply Adequate,"This unit performs adequately in its intended job (shredding paper). I have two caveats with this unit. One, it does not shred the left corner of the paper, instead leaving a straight strip of paper. Two, the shred particles are too big. For example, I shred a bank statement and looked at a random shred and was able to read my entire account number. My best advice is this, safety is one thing, quality shredding is another. Look elsewhere."
3,Probably good enough but not great,"I wish it shredded more finely. Often you can read 3 or 4 letters on a line of print. I will concede that it would be very difficult to reconstruct a line of type, especially after several sheets of paper had been shredded into the same pile. All the same, it makes me a little nervous when I am sometimes able to read an entire 3 to 4 letter word on a shredded strip."
3,"OK, but light duty","This is an OK shredder for LIGHT use. Its power is MUCH less than its bigger brothers (one of which I also have). It says it can shed 5 sheets at once, but I find it begins to labor with more than two!"
4,Wash Cloth Fellowes 32057 Powershred P-57Cs Shredder,"Works well. Kinda top heavy, but I had no problem. Had to let it cool off once."
3,"Not a cross cut shredder. Underpowered, but chews through power cables just fine.","I wish this shredder had more power. It works fine for single document shredding. Well, as long as it's not doubled up. And also as long as the document isn't near the edge where it will wad up as it enters the shredder. Ugh. If you buy this, make sure that you purchase some needle nose pliers too. The safety feature seems to work well. It protects little fingers, but does nothing to stop your wife from dropping your DS power cable in the slot.This is NOT a crosscut shredder. That was another disappointment for me. It says confetti cut, which I guess means the same as strips of paper that are easily reassembled."
4,Very good shreader,"This shreader really makes confetti. I have not tried as many pieces at the same time as the instructions say you can, because the shreaderdoes not seem to be able to handle more than two at a time but it is stillworth the money."
4,So far so good,"I replaced a lighter duty model Fellowes shredder (not cross cut) with this model. I use it for home office work so it doesn't get heavy duty use. So far this seems ideal for home use. It handles credit cards easily, which is nice. I limit the input to about 4 sheets max because it starts to work much harder when you go beyond that and I don't want to overtax it. So far I'm happy with the purchase."
3,Extremely Light Duty Shredder,"I purchased this shredder a couple of weeks ago. Have been using it for a week now. Its OK, but it is much more of a light duty shredder than I realized. I had read all the reviews but hadn't figured that out. I am writing this as informational only. Its rated at 8 sheets, but almost struggles with 2 sheets, 3 pretty much makes me think I will need to disasemble it. Just putting in an envelope makes the machine sound like its struggling. I just tried to shred a credit card and I was sure it was jamming, but it did go through. It is very loud. I finally burned out my last shredder of 12 years, it had cost quite a bit more at that time (around $100) but it was quiet and could easily take 6 sheets. Since this thing is so cheap, $50 its probably worth it. Sort of wish I bought a better one now, but its to much of a hassle to send it back. In the future I will purchase shredders in local stores. Hope this info helps someone. PS. I am using this for home, not a business."
2,Less than reliable,I purchase my Fellows 57C about a year ago. The claims of handling 8 sheets ata time is false advertising. It can handle maybe 3-4 sheets at a time withoutjamming. Last week it just up and died. I am not happy with this product.
5,"Strong shredder, great for the price","I've tried several shredders and have ended up sticking with this one. The tub is large enough, it has a ""shred"" / ""off"" / ""reverse"" switch. Also, it has an auto-protect feature that turns off the shredder when skin touches the silver metal around the top, but you can turn off this feature. Several points:It is durable: my first lasted several years, and my second is going strong.It's strong: it takes 4-5 pieces of paper with no problem, and 7-8 alright. It also shreds credit cards, CD's, and full envelopes (junk mail) with no problem.It's loud: on the down side, it makes a decent amount of noise. It's not unbearable and to be expected, but it's a little louder than the other ones I had.It's cheap: for the price, I think it's an excellent deal.All in all, I recommend it."
2,Failed after about a year,"I bought my machine based on all the favorable reviews here. However, as in another poor review on here, mine started acting up after about a year. Paper started to get jammed between two blades. As I looked closer, I saw that there are blades between other blades designed to clean out this paper with each revolution. In one row, the blade was missing and that was where packed paper was building up. It's possible that the blade fell out and was discarded with the shredded paper. I sure can't find it. I'm surprised that anything would dislodge that blade since I usually don't put in more than 2-3 sheets at a time and the heaviest thing I insert would be an occasional credit card. My machine gets fairly light office use, so I'm disappointed that it didn't last longer. I think I'm going to try a brand other than Fellowes for the next one."
3,"Not bad, but certainly not heavy duty","This shredder isn't bad, but it seems a bit underpowered. It absolutely slows down even if shredding 3 pages at once. It has difficulty handling any more than that at one time. The downside of this is that you often can't just shred an entire junkmail envelope at once, you have to open it up and shred the contents in two passes. I like the safety features, though."
4,Shredder great; Amazon stinks!,Good shredder; a bit noisy. Amazon reduced the list & sales price by 25% AS my order was being processed. NO OPTIONS OFFERED - POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!
2,Jams all the time,This shredder lasted about year for me....it now just jams all the time. I do not recommend.
3,Must Press on edge,"This shredder does take more pages than my old one (it said it would) and staples don't even make a sound as they go through, but there is a safety switch of some sort on the right upper edge under the top of the box that must be depressed before it will shred. So we must PRESS on that part of the lid for every use. Since it is under a desk, that is a bit awkward although not particularly difficult to push down."
1,Poor construction prevents product from functioning,"When the shredder is placed on the bin, it does not fit correctly. As a result, the safety is not deactivated once the unit is put in place unless the user applies downward pressure. Not only did the first one I returned have this issue, but the replacement had the exact same problem. I did read one other similar review of the product. While I'm not sure why others haven't experienced this, I'd be surprised if these were completely isolated incidents! Even though it seems to work fine when pressure is applied, I would seriously consider buying a different product."
3,"Good product, but sometimes annoying to operate","Works great, but annoying to get started. The top part needs to be pushed against the basket to turn on. I wish it snapped on.Shipping and ordering were great and very easy."
5,works great,"I have had this shredder for a month now, and it works great. It handles paper easily, although it says it can do 8 sheets at a time, I usually stick to five sheets because I don't want any problems. I have shredded credit cards with no problems also. I reccomend this product."
1,Stopped working after a few months,"We've had this shredder for a few months now and do a moderate amount of shredding. We noticed it really wasn't taking the paper anymore and working VERY slowly when it did. Forget doing multiple sheets. It's now pretty much useless. It looks like a good and solid machine, but it didn't work out for us."
3,pretty good but . . .,"it doesn't shred anything too ""thick,"" which means it won't shred those credit card junk mail offers we all get unless you open the junk mail, separate it into parts, and then shred (and who wants to do that?). oh well."
3,more power please,Fellowes 32057 Powershred P-57Cs ShredderTHIS PRODUCT IS VERY LOUD AND LACKS POWER. IT BOGGS DOWN WITH 3 OR 4 SHEETS OF PAPER.
3,Fellowes Shredder,Well i am disappointed with the performance of this product it is so slow and noisy. It's supposed to shred 8 sheets at a time but when I tried 5 sheets it was hard pressed already in shredding the paper. It lacks the power to shred forcefully.
5,Great Home Shredder,"Works great for light use. If your looking to get rid of sensitive mail, or items printed from your computer, confetti cutting is the way to go.The automatic on/off feature is real nice, along with the large basket. If this is going to be your first shredder, you can't go wrong by purchasing this one."
2,While it worked it was pretty good...,Broke within the first month for no reason...I called Fellowes CS and they are going to send me a new one...I was only using it for junk mail...I guess you have to put one page at a time...
4,powershredder P-57cs,"purchased the fellowes 32057 Powershedder for my home personal use. It will probably only be used once a year around tax season to shred old papers from previous years, very gental use. Upon using it this year it was great. It states it takes up to eight papers at once which it groned through but did shred. I then gave it less at a time and it managed well. I have yet to try credit cards. The paper was nicely shedded, and all the mess was contained. It suggessed that you oil it after each full basket which happens quickly. For my use, the product is exactly what I needed."
4,Decent Shredder for Home Use,"This shredder is decent for the home office if you don't have to shred a lot of documents or you have plenty of time to spend shredding. The description says it will accept up to eight (8) pages at a time but I'm afraid that is a big exaggeration. I'd say you can do up to three (3) safely without distressing the motor too much. I have a much more powerful shredder at my work, the Fellows DM-6, so I have something heavy duty to compare to. However, there are some nice features on the P-57Cs listed in the item description, so I do recommend with the caveats noted above."
3,Fellowes 32057 Powershred P-57C,"This is a well built heavy duty shredder. It does a great job of shredding. My only complaint is that the shredderhead is heavy for me to lift off and isvery messy to empty into the trash bag. I have shredded paper all over thefloor to clean up. There is a 3 year warranty on the shredder head which most of them only have a year. It does a great job, staples and all but Iam just somewhat disappointed it is so heavy to lift and so messy to empty."
4,so far; so good,Works fine so far. I've had it for about a month. Ate up the initial stack of paper easily but I fed it only 3 or 4 sheets each time and let it rest after 10 passes or so. Seems much more powerful than my old Staples brand shredder.
4,NIce Shredder!,"It is a great home office shredder. I am glad i bought this. It has a feature that won't let it shred if you are touching anywhere near the opening where you put the papers in for shredding. Its pretty quiet when its shredding, so no complaints there. I am happy with my purchase!"
5,Worked as anticipated without problems.,"Swing-up top for emptying is quite convenient and probably the main attraction for me.Everything seems to work as described. Does not get heavy use, and cannot, as of now, commenton longevity.Satisfied with purchase."
1,Horrible,"I thought that by purchasing a more expensive shredder, I would get a better one. Not true. I have NEVER heard such a loud shredder in my life. In fact, it was so bad that I returned it. To date, Amazon.com has not refunded my money."
4,Works well if treated right,"This shredder has been working well for me now that I have worked out how to treat it. I give it just one sheet at a time (any more and it struggles), and when I hear it starting to slow down I know its getting full and its time to pop the lid off and stamp on the shredded paper a few times to tamp it down.Whatever you do, don't hit the reverse button when it starts to slow down without checking first to see whether its getting full. If you hit reverse when the bin is full it will suck up the shredded paper from the bin and cause a real jam."
1,Not very powerful,"Purchased this shredder in February, 2008.After reading other reviews, treated it carefully and did not abuse it, but it stopped working after only a month. Be careful about this product - it is a bulldog without teeth!"
2,8 sheets? yeah right,"Maybe I had too high an expectation, but I've yet to see this go through 8 sheets of paper. Constantly jams. Nearly worthless for shredding all the credit card junk mail offers I get. Have to open each one and feed them through at most 3 sheets at a time.Maybe it can cut 8 sheets of TP, but even cheap glossy paper causes issues. And god forbid if you try and shred an envelope. Other shredders I've used work fine, just drop a piece of junkmail, envelope and all and your done. Not so here. An standard size envelope with 2 sheets inside results in 8 sheets thick to cut through. I have tested it and found that a single piece of paper in a standard tri-fold envelope typically jams. That's only 6 sheets thick. If you want a practical device, go bigger and better. This thing does not work as advertised."
5,Works well!,"The Shredder works as advertised, and is not too noisy. You have to be some what careful not to jam it, but it will shred the listed 8 pages at a time. Overall I am quite satisfied."
2,Not great but works OK,"This shredder is OK but definitely not great. I have been disappointed in how frequently it jams, especially since I use it relatively little.Pros: Looks nice, shredder motor swivels up to allow you to look in the can to see how full it is. Touch sensor works well and activates only when appropriate.Cons: Frequently jams. If you put more than 3-4 pieces of paper in at a time you can really hear it struggle, and 6-8 will definitely jam it. One problem is that it can't handle junk mail - if you put an unopened junk mail envelope in its slot you have a guaranteed jam on your hands.In retrospect, I would have paid more for a more powerful shredder that could handle junk mail, even though I'm not even running a home office or anything. This shredder is barely functional for even regular home use."
1,Broken when it arrived,"The shredder was broken when it arrived, but Amazon replaced it immediately with no questions asked and arranged for the return and replacement."
2,Poor construction,This shredder works for awhile but is delicate and must be handled with care. I could not shred the amount of paper at a time as claimed. I had lots of shredding to do and it could not handle it making it very irritating to wait for it to rest. Then it broke completely. When I looked at it it had plastic gears which is cheap construction and not made for the long haul. Very disappointed.
4,Fellowes Powershred P-57Cs,"The shredder works very well though the the crosscut pieces are not as small as others I have used. The power head is very heavy and does not easily reinsert on top of the basket. However, the thing that upset me is that the guide underneath where the shredded paper comes out just dropped off. Of course the little plastic protrusions that hinged it to the undercarriage are broken off and there is no way to put it back on. That could have been more studily constructed. I cannot see where that has hurt the shredding of paper, but watch the level in the basket closely, so it will not back up into the shredder."
2,Fellowes 32057 Power Shredder,Motor on shredder overloads with more than 2 sheets of paper. Jams consistently.I have a concern that this will not function as advertised
3,Makes a lot of noisy,"When this machine is in operation, there is a lot of unruly noise. I don't think it's a manufacture defect but simply caused by a loud motor. Other shredders do not make half as much noise as the P-57c. Unless you do not mind have a loud shredder, everything works as adverstised."
1,Dead on arrival,"I received my package from Amazon and the inner package seemed fine. I opened the box and assembled the unit and it wouldn't work. After some time I realized that the safety switch engages with a tab on the plastic bin, and the molding is of such poor quality that the switch and the tab will not align unless you manually push down on the right side of the unit. They claim that the test each unit before shipping, guess someone was asleep while they tested this one."
1,Didn't work!,"This item was meant to be a gift for my father. So I simply wrapped the box without first testing it (I didn't want it to look pre-opened). It was quite embarrassing when he opens it and tries to plug it in but nothing happens. No light, no noise, no nothing. It simply had no power running through it. When purchasing this item, I had read some other reviews about this happening and figure: ""It won't happen to me!"" But it did, so it can. I was able to return it to Amazon for a full refund. So if you purchase this shredder, know it might come with a little extra hassle."
1,Died after 7 minutes,"This died on me after about 7 minutes of shredding the very first time. I didn't put too many sheets through at once. There were supposed to be some safeguards that would keep it from overheating, but they apparently didn't work. I read the instructions, reset it, unplugged & plugged it back in, waited overnight, but nothing could get it to start working again. Shipped back to Amazon..."
1,Problem with shredder design/activation,"I've only used the shredder a couple of times. It works, but not without a problem. The top (with the motor and blades) doesn't fit so the trigger switch (in the bottom basket) will activate the shredder, unless you exert pressure on the top. So, you must hold down the top with one hand while you are feeding paper into the shredder with the other, or it doesn't work. I believe this is a significant design imperfection in this shredder. Very inconvenient. I bought this shredder because of the Fellowes name, but I guess every manufacturer makes units ""cheaply"" today. This could have been easily averted, if Fellowes had run quality tests, I believe. I would not buy again based on the manufacturer name."
5,great home shredder,"I read some people who bought this machine who wasn't too happy. However I think this machine is quality built and will last if used on a regular basis, meaning giving it some break when the machine is put under heavy use. My son-2 years old likes to shred with it and thank God there is a safety feature. I leave it turned off when not in use just in case he decides to shred with it unattended. So far we have shred papers, envelopes, and thick heavy duty papers and it did not give us any problems. Getting it to sit correctly on the bin is a bit cumbersome but no big deal. For the price I paid for here at Amazon, It's a great buy. You will not be dissapointed."
1,Didn't work out of the box - returned,I guess I just got a bad one but was very disappointed that it did not work. I had to send it back which is always a pain. The product felt kinda cheap so I decided to go with another brand of shredder.
5,Great Product,"Does a great job.I do not insert more than two or three sheets at once, slows way down."
4,Fellows shredder,This Fellows shredder was much heavier than expected and is quite loud. It appears to do a very good job of shredding in the short time I have owned it. It is also quite bulky and takes some effort to seat the unit onto the provided basket. You have to jiggle it to get it just right so it will work.
4,"Fellowes shredder, so far so good","I replaced an inexpensive moderate-use modelfrom Office Max with this Fellowes P-57Cswhen the original crapped out after 4.5 years.A tech at Office Max said I was lucky to get 4.5 yearsout of that model.So far, I prefer the Fellowes. It's quieter,or at least a much less grating sound. However,I will only feed it 1-2 sheets at a time based on theway it loads the motor. That suits our use prettywell anyway. Safety shut-off works well (not too sensitiveon my unit).At first I didn't like the ""tilting"" housing over the basket.Now I think it's fine (tilt up, observe paper level, shove paper down a bit).Take top off to empty bin. I don't have any issue with the lightweightbin. So far, anyway.Pros: Quieter, good opening size, robust feel,side on-off switch, black color is neutral and unobtrusiveCons: Consider it a 1-2 sheet capacityIf it lasts a few years, I'd get another Fellowes.We'll see."
4,Nice Shredder--works 4 years later,"For the price it works real well. It really only does about 3 pages, 4 pages tops, and seems like its straining sometimes, but it never stops working or never overheats since I have bought it. I have had it work for about 4 baskets full on more than one occasion and no issues, and I previously had used over 4 other machines over the last year. This one is here to stay!-----Updated 12/7/12...still going strong 4.5 years later. I make sure to use shredder oil on it and it's been literally working like a well oiled machine. BTW I shred 100s of papers at the same time and once I use oil after every basket dump it keeps going.Great purchase!"
4,A Good Lightweight Shredder,"This unit is a good shredder if you don't have a great deal of things to shred. It will handle two to three 8.5X11 sheets without much fuss. According to the manual (yes I did read the manual) it should only be run five minutes at a time with a cool down period of a couple of minutes. The unit shuts down after each sheet wich doies not give very much time to clear the shredded paper from the gears. The unit also will shut off if you touch (even so slightly) the metal rim around the paper feed. It took me a whie to get used to that. Over all though, I would purchase this model again."
1,TWO DUDS IN A ROW,"I had a miserable experience with these. The first one was a dud. I sent it back. The second one was a dud, too. Neither would even start. Amazon is giving me a refund."
4,Fellowes 32057 Powershred P-57Cs Shredder (Purchased on 08/10/2008),Good:Easy to set up.Works fine.Strong motor.Bad:Ribbon shredder is not as compact as diamond cut.The basket size is somehow small for frequent user and fill up quickly.
1,Fellowes 32057 Powershred P-57Cs Shredder,Terrible product. It did not work out of the box. Something was wrong with the plug so it would not function. The only positive thing to say is that Amazon paid for the return shipping and refunded my account.
4,"good capacity, works great","I even let my 6 year old shred what needs to be shredded. She is happy as a clam, and I know her little fingers are safe with the safety function, and she loves the shreds. It works great, even when you have a few sheets together. Maybe 6 are a bit too much, but 3 is just fine."
2,Looks can be deceiving....,"This is the second one of these shredders I have purchased. The first one only worked the first time. I used it very carefully by only shredding 2-3 sheets of paper at a time, only ran it 3-4 minutes and cleaned the paper shreds from the blades (you do have to take these measures to keep any shredder working for a long time). I sent it back thinking it must be defective. I have always purchased this brand of shredders and been completely satisfied. So, I bought a second one. This one won't even turn on! Another defective unit or maybe this company has lowered their standards and is manufacturing cheaply and poorly built shredders. This shredder does look very sturdy and is heavy too, but don't let it's appearance fool you, it's a wimp!!!"
4,Just the right Price,We needed a personal shredder and this was the right size and price. Works great. We are very happy with this product.
4,Good For The Price,"This is not an industrial shredder and barely handles the five pages. It's good for the price and what it is. Good safety features, simple operation, and tolerable noise volume makes this Fellowes a good purchase."
1,Just buy the official Nintendo Wii bar!,"I thought I could save a little money by buying a third-party replacement for my original Wii sensor bar, but this was awful! Not only did the batteries not fit correctly in the compartment (it called for five AA batteries, but once you put all five in, there was still about an inch of loose space left!), but it stopped working after about two months. In those two months of use, I was always frustrated at its lack of sensitivity. Just pay a little more and get the official Wii sensor bar. It's worth it."
2,An accident!,"As a fan of idm, this is the hardest music i listen in years. Its very experimental and chaotic. It takes too much time to get used to listening. My first 4 tries of listening the album was a disaster and i couldn't even stand to 5th song. If you planing to buy this album, go and search the group or download mp3 etc... This music is not for everybody.Two stars just becouse they are really experimental."
5,must have,"if you want to bake awesome bread you MUST try on of these. Had mine for about 4 years just cracked it tonite..you have to use either parchment paper or corn meal so the bread doesnt stick and be careful w/ the steam/spray bottle, it may crack....but its worth it, about to buy another one!"
2,La Cloche Brick Oven,Very disappointed with this product. The base platter cracker during the second use of the oven. Evidently the product cannot handle even minimal handling.
2,The bottom pan arrived broken,"This is a good product - BUT it was packed in a foolishly light box with the bell's handle directly touching the base pan without any protection, so the base arrived broken in half by the cloche's handle!I have a friend who is on his second Cloche, both have broken bottoms - tho' he still uses them for baking superb bread. I used my clay romertopf baker, perhaps a little more ungainly, but the bread was equally superb, and beautifully golden with a great crust. I've had it for decades and it's still intact.I cannot understand how they could have boxed it so foolishly and there is no excuse for it breaking so easily after use by my friend.I think the Sassafras is shoddy"
2,Delivers a Detrimental Bread Sauna in the Wrong Baking Cycle,"Commercial bakers actually open the vents of their oven during the final cycle to remove the moisture, producing a thin, crunchy crust typical of a good artisan loaf.A Sassafras baker completely reverses this steam protocol and delivers its steamy death-punch at the end of the cooking cycle when crust has already developed, sealed the loaf, and commercial ovens designed to remove the moisture that is a detrimental factor to good volume and a quality crust.A cold loaf, inside a room temperature clay baker is incapable of producing the environment demanded for optimum bread-baking chemistry. Steam will not begin in a clay baker until well beyond the first third of the baking cycle when it benefits the loaf.Moreover, Sassafras bakers do not withstand normal home thermal demands and they break easily without any provocation."
1,Made in Mexico - They Break Just Looking at Them!,"I do not think Sassafras is safe. Sassafras bakers do not withstand normal home thermal demands and they break easily without any provocation. Since they break without warning, I am concerned they will crack when hot and harm our small pets that hover around our feet. I have had two separate bakers break. It is not worth the risk, especially because they do not make any appreciable difference than a cheap squirt bottle.Moreover, functionally, a cold loaf, inside a room temperature clay baker is incapable of producing the environment demanded for optimum bread-baking chemistry. Steam will not begin in a clay baker until well beyond the first third of the baking cycle when it benefits the loaf."
2,Breaking Bread,"First I must say I use Amazon whenever I possibly can because of their customer service. I bought this Sassafras La Cloche to help me improve my sourdough bread making process. The first round loaf I made under the bell was beautiful. The second time I used the la cloche, warming the entire unit in the oven from 0-425 degrees caused the bottom of the la cloche to crack at about 375 degrees. I notified Amazon who within two days replaced the entire unit, no questions asked. Having read other reviews of this product, I see quite a few people have had the same problem with the bottom plate. I am afraid to use the bottom plate again, so I use it to store the finished product. It is a great crumb catcher. I substituted the bottom portion with a ceramic pizza pan and set the La cloche lid on top. Works great and the bread is outstanding. Thanks Amazon!"
1,Broken,I have the longer version of this baker I bought in Chicago and love it. I have know received 6 yes 6 of these brick oven's that are all broken. The bottom is in 10 pieces each. They replace it and the new one comes broken. I wish I could find this in a store. I give up.
4,Cloche,The cloche was just what I had expected. I just felt that it was a bit pricey. Tried the bread recipe that came with it and it turned out delicious.
1,The Base Has a Crack/seam Baked Into It -- Poor Quality,"After using the product a few times, I decided inspect it and make sure it was holding up to my standards. Unfortunately, I noticed a 3 inch crack/seam that looks like it happened during the fabrication of my La Cloche. The seam is baked into the clay (and was not caused by my three uses of it), but I'm concerned that it will become a problem one day after several uses."
4,Thick crust and excellent texture,The Sassafras Las Cloche Brick oven is a little larger than I had thought it would be but it bakes an incredible loaf of sourdough bread. I have been trying to get a thick crust like this for years and had never succeeded until I started using the La Cloche. The interior of the loaf has lots of air bubbles and the bread is moist without being wet. It's as good as a loaf of bread baked in an industrial brick oven --- and I never thought I'd be able to bake bread that good in my own oven.
1,Some brick,I would not bother to purchase this very fragile oven until they fix the packaging - the original cloche I ordered and a replacement one arrived broken.
1,Poor shipping methods,"After reading good reviews of the Cloche, I was excited to try one. Amazon shipped two of them to me on separate occasions, and both arrived in pieces because of the haphazard packaging methods that the warehouse employed: a couple of balloon strips in the box is simply not enough protective material to prevent an item this heavy and fragile from breaking in transit. I finally gave up because I was told the Cloche was on backorder and I was annoyed with having to make trips to the post office to send it back. Until Amazon greatly improves their packaging methods, I don't recommend buying this item."
5,This will help you make even greater bread,"I got this on the recommendation of the people who wrote ""Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day"". They had it featured on their blog. Wow. What a wonderful addition to my oven. I've been making breads from that cookbook and they have been very good. By adding the bell of this to the pizza stone already in the oven, I have been able to achieve crusts that are as good as anything you will ever get from an artisanal bakery. My husband makes biscuits and he uses the base of this brick oven for the biscuits and covers them with the bell for the first 10 or 15 minutes then takes it off and lets them brown. Those have been the best biscuits, ever.Anyone who wants to make really good bread at home should have this brick oven."
3,good but not great,"The oven works very well. However, even though I examined it thoroughly before use and preheated it gently as I preheated the oven - it appears to have formed cracks in the bottom. Too expensive an item for that to happen. Too heavy to return. Enjoying it but concerned it will break entirely before long."
1,"broken, and broken again","after reading the reviews, i decided to take a chance and order the baker because i have used sassafras cookware before and i love it. i had not been able to find the brick oven. i thought the breakage issue would have been addressed, since so many customers received broken brick ovens. my first one -- broken. amazon customer service was fantastic, sent out another one overnight, and it arrived -- BROKEN.i think you can order the deep dish pizza pan and have a bottom that will work with the top, but of course that is a waste of money.any other ideas?"
5,Love It !,"When I read all the reviews on the La Cloche, it made me uneasy making the purchase. The item arrive in great condition, the breads i have baked in it are amazing and getting better. The packing of the item could be better, but over all a great item to own with great baking results."
1,Still waiting!!!,We have not yet received our order after nearly three months...the first two orders were broken and sent back. You have shipped them in the worst shipping methods I have ever seen...someone does not know what they are doing. We expect to receive this item as soon as you can figure out how to hire someone who knows how to ship fragile items...the box did not inform the post office that the item was fragile...that is ridiculous.I hope that you will settle this issue because we will never order another product from you again. We are very disappointed in Amazon.Please put someone on this case immediately.
5,excellent bread baker,I am very happy with this product. It fits into my portable convection oven and bakes a loaf of bread just as pictured on the box. I use the recipes from the breadtopia website.
1,Still arriving broken,"I'd love to be able to rate the performance of this item but it arrived broken. I had read many reviews and saw several complaining about the fact that this product often arrives broken. However, since many of those reviews date back to 2007, I foolishly assumed that surely by now that problem would be resolved. When I opened the box and saw the terrible packing job and that the bottom was broken in three pieces, I couldn't believe it. All I can assume is that the manufacturing must make a killing on this product and it is overpriced since they seem willing to tolerate a high rate of returned products. Hopefully the replacement will arrive in one piece. If not, I'll order a Romertopf. I have one of those in the french bread loaf shape and the packaging was sturdy and it arrived perfectly fine. What a shame that the makers of La Cloche aren't more concerned about satisfying their customers."
4,Great for Camping,"Got this for camping. Not a huge fan of instant coffee, and didn't want to get the Coleman coffee maker that you put over your camp stove because of the glass pot. No doubt I would break it. And I suck at making perk coffee. Always full of grounds and taste terrible. So this seemed like a great alternative. It has been. No complaints. Does what it is supposed to and does it well."
2,This press makes sludgey coffee,I got this press hoping to replace a broken glass french press. I have bought and broken so many glass French Presses that my husband named them Kenny (after the South Park character). I had minimal expections and this only met one of them -it hasn't broken yet. The filter seems to be pretty ineffective. It let's both the finest AND some of the larger bits of coffee grinds through. The coffee turns out almost black. When I add milk it is easy to see just how many broken beans end up in the cup. If you really love french press coffee I would pass on this one
4,Nissan Thermal Coffee Press,"We love pressed coffee and when our glass press broke, we decided to try a thermal one instead to keep it hot longer. This one works well. The coffee stays hot and fresh for a long time. If you just press the coffee without stirring the grounds and letting them settle first, you get a lot of grounds in your cup of coffee. We now stir it when it is done brewing and wait a few minutes before we press it down. We still get some grounds which seems to be common in presses. The amount is very small though. I pour it through a small tea strainer. The rest of the family just takes it with the grounds. My only real complaint is that you can't see inside the press to check brewing progress or to see how much coffee is left. That is pretty minor though."
4,Works great!,"This press works well, at a price much less than other insulated models. The screen fits nice and tight. The only reason that I gave it four stars is because the lid is not insulated. With an insulated lid, this press would keep the coffee hot for much longer."
3,"Great Coffee, but the lid leaks!","The Nissan Thermos French Press makes great coffee!There is a problem with the lid, however! The rim of the lid is not deep enough and does not form a complete seal when in the thermos. Coffee will leak out no matter in which direction the pour spout ""hole"" is pointed (whether it is lined up with the pour spout or whether it is against the body of the thermos and coffee should technically NOT be going out).If the lid had a longer rim that depentrated deeper into the thermos that might help prevent leaks.Also, there is a ring depression in the thermos, just below the rim. If the lid had a ""O""-ring designed to fit into that ring depression (along with the longer rim on the lid mentioned above), then the thermos would probably not leak.Perhaps the company might consider a redesign along these lines?"
1,Good if you like to chew your coffee,"Good price, keeps coffee warmer than a glass press. I have been using the press for a couple weeks now and still cannot get coffee without grounds in it. The screen has gaps along the edge so when you press the coffee some grounds pass through to what you pour in your cup. I would not recommend this press to anyone. Buck up and get something with some quality."
2,Nissan French Press,"nice concept, bad execution.i much prefer stainless steel (rather than glass), but the filter mesh assembly is not well designed on this model, unfortunately. the mesh doesn't wrap all the way around the spring that pushes it against the walls, so looks like there are some gaps where grinds can sneak through, resulting in more sediment in the cup.still usable, but wouldn't buy a new one if it goes.edit: can buy bodum replacement mesh, which works slightly better, but still not perfect."
3,Americanized press.,"Not a true french press in that it just presses most of the grounds to the bottom of the pot and leaves the brew standing on the grounds. For a fast couple of cups, it is good."
4,Works well,"I have no experience with other makes. This is my first press. The construction is very good. The ability to keep coffee hot is fair. The only negative would be the amount of fine grounds which by-pass the screen. All in all, I would buy another one if I lost this one."
1,"Screen Does Not Fit, Grounds in Coffee","I bought this for my husband to use while camping, and unfortunately the first outing was a week after the return ""window"" expired. The screen is too large, and makes 2 triangle-shaped folds when pressed down, allowing coffee grounds to get into the coffee. Needless to say, he doesn't like it."
4,Makes for great coffee!,"The unit was delivered promptly and has been used daily since. It is light, easy to clean, is well constructed and has an excellent appearance. We will enjoy it for years to come. I also will be sending one to my cousin in Florida whom I'll be visiting shortly as I don't want to miss my excellent cup of coffee while there."
3,Faulty screen design,I purchased this press because it is a stainless steel thermos. Should be great quality right? I have owned many different brands and styles of presses in the last 10 years. This has the worst of all of them. The screen's diameter is too large and folds are created allowing grounds above the press. I have looked back at past review and this has been a problem for years and for some reason it has not been corrected. Very disappointed.
4,Great Product,"Good product does what it claims. Nice looking and easy to use. It has replaced our regular drip coffee pot. Pouring is a bit slow because of the small spout, but a very minor issue. Keeps coffee hot for over an hour without preheating. Metal mesh plunger and filter seems to hold up."
3,Unbreakable! but mesh needs improvement,"I bought this press after my children broke my third glass coffee press. I was tired of replacing glass beakers and cleaning up the mess!Makes good coffee, and of course, won't break with normal handling. But right out of the box, the mesh filter would crease in a couple spots where it was supposed to seal against the inside of the container. This always let some of the grounds through when pressing. I don't mind some fines in the bottom of the cup, but I am not into chunky coffee. I still had the mesh filters from my two previous Bodum presses, so I adapted one of those to use with the new Thermos press. Problem solved. No more chunky coffee."
4,Nissan Coffee press,"This was my first coffee press, so temper my evaluation accordingly.I found the Nissan press well made, and after several weeks ofuse once or twice a day, it has only required a rinse to bequite clean inside. The screen press portion can be easilydisassembled for cleaning.It does not hold the coffee hot for hours as the product brochureindicates, but rather for 1.5 hours.At no fault of the product, I find that it requires more work toclean up than a normal brewer, and that 8 cup capacity is notenough.I believe the screen will need replacing, for I see some bends(mild kinks) on the edge, even though I have been very gentlewith it.Obviously, the taste of the coffee is much fuller than with anormal coffee brewer. It took a few tries to get it to whereI found the best taste. For me, using Folgers or Maxwell housecoffee, 6 tablespoons per 8 cup batch."
3,Mostly Good,"I purchased this coffee press for my husband. By and large, he's been happy with it. It certainly keeps the coffee warm. But the screen is a tad too big, which causes it to buckle at the edges when you push the plunger, thereby letting coffee grounds through to the ""drinkable"" part of the container."
4,Life time coffee press,"After breaking my glass swiss made coffee press,I looked to Amazon for a larger selection than the local stores,{without wasting gas} this stainless lined press is very well made and eazy to clean. My reason for only four stars is that our fellow Americans did not particapate in it's production. [ASIN:B00004S1DB Thermos Nissan 34-Ounce Vacuum Insulated Stainless-Steel Gourmet Coffee Press]"
5,Great alternative to glass press!,"I ordered this press several months ago for my husband, who is a bona fide coffee snob. We have used a glass (Bodum) press for many years, but when our carafe broke, I started looking for an alternative. We also travel a lot, and this press met my needs for both problems. The thermos keeps the coffee warm for at least an hour, but probably more. The stainless steel outer has been knocked over at least twice, and there's not so much as a scratch on it. It packs well for trips, camping and otherwise. If you like a coffee press, but don't like the breakable glass carafe, or how quickly it loses heat, this is the press for you! And the price is very affordable! Even coffee-snob-husband loves it!"
3,Good idea,"This is my first use of a coffee press, so maybe I am not doing it correctly. So far I am unable to brew a cup of coffee without the grounds seeping into it. The screen filter arrived slightly bent in several spots which I tried to smooth out with little success. I was really looking forward to using this at my work desk, but have set it aside for now until I can get a clear brew. A good idea anyway."
4,Coffee press is o.k.,"I like the fact that it is unbreakable.I don't like that there are always grounds in my coffee. The mesh doesn't hold them all in.It doesn't hold very much more than the Bodum glass presses.While it doesn't keep coffee hot much over an hour, I usually drink it all by then, so it's not a problem.Except for the grounds issue, I'm fairly satisfied with this product."
4,Filter frustrations,"I have owned one of these buggers for about 7 years now. Basically it rocks, but my filter is all torn up now for many years. I have searched high and low for a replacement filter and although this product boasts having replacements, I have found none!!! I have to hand filter any coffee with a strainer per cup which is a mess! So now I drink tea in the thermos! Go figure!"
2,Screen Leaks,The screen has numerous bends in the screen alowing the coffee grinds to escape past into your cup.This keeps the coffee hot for extended period of time if needed but after pressed we fill 2 cups up and drink it.
3,"Use carefully, ground do slip through the screen","I was dis appointed the first several tries with making coffee with this press because the coffee grounds seemed to make its way past the screen into the coffee. The thermos is not great at keeping the coffee hot for long. After a while I was able to make coffee (Less grounds in coffee) with this press by slowly and carefully plunging the press. If you want a good press and can due without the thermos go with Bodum. If your really counting on the idea of your coffee staying hot with the thermos style, you might be disappointed a little."
3,Same issue as others,"This lets too many grinds through. But other than gritty coffee, its a great product for my office. So I'll keep it."
1,Nissan thermos french press coffee maker,the mesh screen became bent and does not keep the grounds at the bottom. There is bitter dregs in the bottom also.
4,Excellent French Press,"Works great, I love that it's insulated. Wish there were some type of markings so you could see how much water to add to the coffee though."
4,Just what the roaster ordered.,"This is just what I have been wanting. Glass presses lose a lot of the heat while they steep, this doesn't. Only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star is that the screen let bit of coffee through. Really not that big of a problem, but always room for improvement."
3,Good for travel,"This is the second Nissan coffee press/vacuum pot I have purchased. I take them overseas, especially when I have an extended stay with access to boiling water. They do not keep the coffee completely free of grounds, nor does the coffee remain hot beyond a few hours. However, they do not break and, if one has access to a microwave or other heating device, one can enjoy an afternoon cup of the coffee easily. The quality of the coffee is superior to that made by in-room Mr. Coffee-type machines or by any travel-perks I have tried. The pot makes enough for four people."
4,"Should be 5 stars, but the screen sucks!","This french press was purchased to replace me and my wife's broken glass french press. I love the way it keeps the coffee hot, but the screen on the press is to large or something. Every time I pour a cup off coffee I get grounds in each cup.. I actually switched out the screen from my broken one and it works better. So now it works perfectly, but that's why I gave it a 4 star rating."
4,it changed my life !,Before - grind coffee ... boil water ... work press pot ... chase kids around house for an hour ... drink cool coffee (sadness).After - grind coffee ... boil water ... work press pot ... chase kids around house for an hour ... drink steaming hot coffee coffee (happiness).Need I say more.
1,I wish it was a great review,"Wow. I fell in love with a french press. It was one of the great conversions of my life. Then my french press broke. So I purchased another one. And then I planned a camping trip. Afraid of another broken heart, I mean carafe, I decided to take the plunge and buy an unbreakable french press.The screen didn't fit rightly! I got grit in my coffee! Oh no!Then I got an idea, an epiphany. I tried it, and it worked! I used an old screen on my new press. AAAHHH. Good coffee. Bad situation turned out okay, this time. But not everyone has extra french press parts just lying around. I wish it could be a great review, but it is NOT."
5,Great product,I have had this press for a few weeks now. Great value for the price and works well. This time I do not have to worry about breaking glass. An insulated stainless steel carafe without the press would cost this much.
3,excessive coffee grounds,"The main gripe I have about this coffee press is that it allows a lot of coffee grounds to escape into the brewed coffee when depressing the press. Not sure why this happens. The two nice things about it are that the coffee stays hot longer than with a glass press, and it does not break. (I broke my Bodum.) Not sure if the these benefits outweigh the annoyance of the escaping grounds."
4,Coffee grind leaks,"Very nice insulated coffee press as it keep the coffee still hot/warm after 4 hours. But taking one star away because as other reviewer reported, some of the coffee grind do get pass the filter. This is due to the screen is slightly too large that it folds/crimples leaving few gaps between it and the canister. I also tried, as another reviewer suggested, with my old Bodum press with this, and it fit perfectly (not gap). I also notice that the coil on the Bodum is stiffer, that may also help. Overall, still happy with this purchase based on the price/value."
2,Eh,"There is no way the coffee will stay hot for the claimed 6 hours. Its hardly warm after about one. (Even after preheating the press.) The screen is also designed poorly, and does not seal against the spring and wall. I've used it 3 times and if had more and more grounds in it each time. I'll be returning it for something else."
3,Thermos Insulated Coffee Press,"I purchased this press because my glass press is not insulated. My glass Bodem press is awesome, this one was sort of a disappointment, because the screen that keeps the coffee grounds contained under the press lets grounds creep up and over the sides, resulting in a mouthful of grounds with the first cup from the press! Yuk! Also, because this press is stainless and you can't see how the press parts are aligned, you can't know if the alignment is correct or not.It shouldn't be that problematic to keep the grounds under the press where they belong!A slighter problem is that you have to really pre-heat the press in order to ""retain"" the heat in the coffee. I have ended up using hot water from the tap, then boiling water for 6-10 minutes, before actually brewing my coffee, just to get the press heated up to retain hot coffee for an hour or so...however, it does keep it hotter longer than my glass press!"
3,Ain't the same!,"Love good, french pressed coffee and have aways used the glass canister. When, in a klutz moment, the carafe wound up in pieces in my sink, I ordered this product. It just ain't the same...simply not as classy and poorly designed. The carafe doesn't hold as much heat as it claims to and the design is poor: when you remove the plunger the strainer screen ""catches"" on the lip, leading to strainer damage VERY quickly. Guess I am a ""purest""...there's just something about watching the coffee brew in the glass carafe (not to mention easier to clean!), so if that's ""you,"" stick with glass."
3,Vacuum?,"This is an OK product, but description is plainly false. It makes good coffee, but where is the ""vacuum"" described? The top fits very loosely and only keeps the coffee warm for an hour, not ""two or three hours."" When I think of ""vacuum"" I think of a vacuum-sealed thermos bottle, for example, and I don't think I'm alone. I wouldn't mind this if they would just not say it's something that it is plainly NOT. That's why I bought it (for the ""vacuum""), so I guess I really should return it, but at this price, why bother? Do you think they know this? I guess it's worth the price, but someome should change the advertisement--it's plainly not a ""vacuum"" anything! Truth in advertising is certainly dead."
1,Beware! Bad design,Coffee grounds in your coffee every time...wobbly press..terible design...does not even keep the horrible coffee hot...beware this product no good man
2,No One SPEAK for At Least 6 Minutes!!,"I'm busy digging the coffee grounds out of my cup because my Thermos Nissan Coffee Press strainer lets them through after just over 1/2 a year of owning it!!!! This irritating routine began, I don't know, a couple of months ago.I'm using a spoon to get them out and I have to take it outside so I don't make a mess of the sink.Sometimes, I get really mad about it and I just swirl the coffee around in the cup and the grounds come to the edge and I pour them out of the cup. Then, I end up with a half a cup of coffee and a splattered mess on the outside of my cup!Please tell me there is a solution to a french press that doesn't give me carpel tunnel because it's too tight or a zillion grounds in my cup because it's too loose!Pardon me while I go scream!"
1,Do not buy--leaks like a sieve,"Top does not screw on, and because of this, the contain will leak if you turn it on the side or accidentally knock it over. I do not know how it could ever be insulated with this poor a connection at the top. All of the heat would bypass the insulation and go straight out the lid. Do not ever buy. You will be wasting your money."
4,A great (& durable!) press,"We've had ours for over a month and have really enjoyed the ease of use & cleaning (body is one piece instead of two with glass ones.) This was a replacement for a broken glass one (one of many) and it's nice to know that this will last for a long time. We've already taken it camping and away for the weekend with out worrying about it getting broken. I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 because we've noticed that when you get to the last cup, some of the coffee grains seep through (but this is probably because we like to use it with very fine grinds instead of the courser ones recommended).Enjoy - a great press!"
3,"thick, hot coffee",I enjoy the temperature that this coffee press affords but I dislike having to use an additional strainer to ensure that I don't get a mouthful of coffee grounds.
2,mediocre,"This seemed like the ideal coffee maker for work, since it is a French press and thermal carafe, all at once. So far, I am not so sure. It does not keep the coffee as hot as a traditional thermos, but I think that is inherent in the cylindrical shape needed to make the French press work. Also, a lot of grounds are making it past the screen. I am going to try a courser grind - that may help. I have been using auto-drip grind."
2,Like Grounds in Your Coffee...? Then This is the Thermos for You.,"Got this because the cat has broken two glass coffeemakers, thought it would be cat-proof. So far, it is, but for whatever reason, a LOT of grounds get into the coffee after you've pressed it. Not sure if ours is defective. I even purchased an additional screen sieve which I pour the coffee through, but still getting grounds. I guess it was too good to be true."
5,Great for taking to work,"I have had this for almost ten years and it is holding up well. I put ground coffee in it, take it to work, and fill it with hot water from the Bunn coffee pot that we have in the break room. Bazinga!"
1,Like coffee grounds in your coffee?,"I've used a lot of different french presses over the years. This Thermos model has a fatal flaw: A channel on the inside that's wider than the screen. So if you fill it up to maximize your coffee volume, then the grounds fill the channel and bypass the screen when you plunge. Voila! Crunchy coffee. To avoid this issue you have to under fill, and stir carefully so as not to get coffee grounds in the channel. And be careful how you put the grounds into this puppy as well. If it's wet they'll stick to the channel. There are just so many ways to mess up your coffee with this thing.Bottom line is this thing is a real pain to use. I'd suggest you get something else. RECOMMENDATION: The Boden stainless insulated french press is the GOLD standard in my mind. It's spendy but man, it is just about perfect."
5,I will never break a glass one again,"This is by far my favorite way to make coffee. The flavor for my husband and self is unbeatable. When guest come in they always ask for coffee from this system and a couple of them purchased their own. Probably due more to clumsiness my 1st,2nd,3rd,4th and 5th pot was glass they just kept breaking in the 2 years I have been using this brewing system I never went looking for a stainless steel one as I thought they would be too expensive. Boy was I wrong. This pot will last me forever (relatively) and the price is up to 70% cheaper than stainless I have seen in the gourmet shops. I love the vacuum you experience I have never seen in any of the glass ones,as well as the insulation it has in keeping the coffee warmer longer. Also this pot holds another cup and 1/2 more than the largest glass one I could find. I like the style of this also. If this is your 1st time trying this brewing system, go right to this pot and skip the glass."
3,"Functional, decent value","Concur with review that says it keeps coffee ""drinkable for about an hour."" NOT as insulated as 2 other plastic presses I picked up in London [Selfridges & John Lewis]. Easy to clean.Annoying that so many coffee grounds escape the cheapo filter. Also annoying that the lid is so loose -- a tighter fit would keep the coffee hot longer, making this a better pot.In a way, surprising that Nissan didn't re-engineer, re-QC this pot to improve Thermos' sound design.In summary, it's stainless, keeps coffee warmer than the glass presses, durable, easy to clean [but must be pre-heated], so not a bad value."
5,Awesome!,"This is exactly what I was looking for. The coffee comes out perfectly brewed at the perfect temperature for me. I let the carafe sit on my counter for about an hour before drinking the rest, and it was still at the perfect temperature. I wish I could find a bigger one, but this is perfect for me!"
5,PERFECT coffee maker,"my son gave this to me as a gift 4 years ago. It is a delight. Simple, minimum of moving parts, excellent coffee that doesn't get cold if i want seconds, a cinch to clean...and nothing to break."
1,Also disappointed,"I too find that this pot, despite its great looks and good insulation, lets an unacceptable amount of grounds through while plunging. I have heard this complaint from others as well. I am also at a loss as to why others give it 5 stars."
1,Screen does not fit,Totally disappointed with this coffee press! The screen did not fit and there were a lot of grounds in my coffee. See the other reviews; this seems to be a common problem.
2,Grounds leak,"I was disappointed in this french press. I've had Bodum presses for years that worked perfectly. When I decided to buy a thermal press, I was hoping to save money by purchasing this one, instead of the more expensive Bodum thermal press. However, this press consistently leaked a small but significant amount of coffee grounds into the coffee, due to creases at the edge of the screen which I could not flatten out. I don't like drinking coffee grounds!"
4,Tops In My Book!!,"I absolutely love my Nissan 34-oz. French Press Coffee thermos/maker. I had more problems unpacking it than anything else as it was so well packed for shipping!After a quick wash-up - I put it up for my first cup. Oh my, what a treat! It has operated with out a hitch for close to a month now and I anticipate no problems.I recommend this unit to all that appreciate that special cup of coffee every time. I also purchased a Proctor Silex, K2070 Electric Kettle - My Coffee Bar is complete and I am a happy camper :)"
1,bad screen,Screen allows large amount of grounds to get by. The lid is also a poor design since it cannot be closed all the way. Otherwise it is of good quality. Keeps coffee very hot for hours.
2,Should have heeded the poor reviews,"I read every review on this pot before ordering it. I was put off by all the reviews stating that the screen was not the right size, and that, as a result, an unacceptable volume of grounds made their way into the resulting coffee. But then there were all these positive reviews. Someone mentioned that she just had to be a bit careful in removing the screen from the pot, and she had no problem with refugee grounds. So I bought it.Upon its arrival, I had only to open the top of the pot to see the problem everyone else had mentioned. The screen is indeed too big for the circumference of the carafe, so it bunched, leaving a gap of about 3/4 of a square centimeter. This was before I even touched the screen. The rest of the assembly looked sturdy enough, but the screen was a major problem, so back the carafe went to Amazon. I'm very disappointed. Would it be that hard to make a screen the right size?"
3,Screen too large,The mesh screen is just a fraction too large for this item. The screen folds up and allows coffee grounds to pass. I fixed this problem by using a screen from a glass unit I had on hand but should not have had to do so. I would not buy again.Ed
4,French Press,Good product and keeps beverage warm. The only bad thing is that you can't see how much is in there!
3,"Good thermos, bad press","The thermos container does a great job at keeping the coffee hot/warm. Generally, the coffee stays warm for 4 hours.But, the stainless steel screen and press itself are sized incorrectly. The screen bends unevenly, forming ridges that pull away from the sides of the carafe. This allows coffee grounds to come through to the coffee side. I can live with it, but certainly not what I would expect from a coffee press.The press is easy to clean."
4,Perfect Thermos Man Mug/Press! :),Brews a smooth cup of joe - makes 4 to 6 good size cups; keeps coffee warm for a good while (more than 1 hour). Easy clean. Can disassemble top of the press for deeper cleaning. Only suggestion for perfecting this further is to make the lid a bit tighter and sturdier. I got this for my husband for Christmas who is a coffee snob and likes his high-end home brew. He was very pleased with the product. Product is made in Malaysia - well made.
4,Very Handy,"This is a very handy coffee plunger. The coffee stays hot for ages. Also great for camping as there is no breakable parts. This is also a good price, I saw the same item at a coffee shop that was $20 dearer. They should make a bigger one too!Thermos Nissan 34-Ounce Vacuum Insulated Stainless-Steel Gourmet Coffee Press"
2,Not a functional product,"So I was looking for a product that would travel well and be functional.The wire mesh did not actually trap the grounds properly so there would be excessive amounts of ground in the coffee. I'm an experienced user of the french press so it's definitely not a lack of knowledge on my part. This is the main reason I returned it.Just as a side note, I also expected the lid to be screw on and somewhat leak proof. That's my impression of the Thermos brand. Was hoping for a travel-well press.Would not suggest this product."
4,I've got three of these,"Been making coffee with a press for 30 years, and have broken many a bodum gass carafe. Got one of these first for camping trips (kayak camping lets you take a few amenities) and quickly got another for home, and a spare (they were on sale). This is bulletproof, makes great coffee, and keeps it warm long enough for a top up. It is NOT a travel mug, or an all day carafe, or a boat bailer - one star only for those who bought it for those purposes. I give it 4 stars only because the screen does wear down around the edges - perhaps stainless steel is rougher than glass, and I can't find a source of replacements. Thanks to the reviewer who pointed out that bodum filters fit - we've got a few of those laying around, and they are available separately right here at amazon."
4,great hot coffee,"The coffee stays hot long enough to drink it all; even with a busy day at work. One drawback is that the screen wrinkles around the edges and lets some grounds through, but not enough to ruin the cup of coffee."
2,Insulated? On what planet?,"My glass press keeps coffee warm longer than this thing. ""Keeps it warm"" is a total misnomer. It immediately starts to get cold. I brew ithe coffee for 5 minutes and the coffee is already cool. BAH!You have to be careful when pressing the filter down because you can't see (duh!) so press slowly or it will come out the spout. Also, the filter doesn't work as well as my Bodum. There are always grounds in my coffee. I'm bummed. I thought this would be perfect for work. Once you start drinking coffee from a press, you just can't drink the stuff at work no matter how good the starting product is."
5,Great Product,"Great product. I have two aboard my boat. The stainless is good quality -- no parts (including screen or other small parts) have rusted despite regular salt water rinses. Of course, does not break like glass ones. And, keeps coffee warm for a surprisingly long time."
1,"don""t buy this one","nothing but coffee grinds in the fresh coffee...i have tried to adjust the filter, but nothing seems to work....oh well...back to a better brand."
3,"great press, poor customer service","It's a great press, does what I want it to. However, I've needed replacement screens for several months now, and everytime I call customer service, I'm told there is a backorder, call back in 6 weeks. So you can't put your name on a list, and they are always out of stock! By the way, the number is 800-831-9242. Call them repeatedly and bug their grouchy customer service reps!"
1,very poor design,"I purchased this item, and had trouble from day 1. The screen that filters the grounds got a little bend on it (along the edge), and allowed lots of grounds to escape into the top part of the carafe after I plunged the coffee.I called Thermos, and the sent me a replacement screen (in a week). The replacement screen did the same thing.I called AGAIN to thermos, and they said that I must have defective unit, and they asked me to send the entire until to them. I did so, and after not hearing from them for about 3 weeks, I called them back, and said that they had received the until, but had not done anything with it yet. The person with who I spoke said that it can take 8 - 10 weeks.Fortunately, it only took another week or so to receive my new coffee press.UNFORTUNATELY, it has the same ding dang problem. Brand new ... out of the box, there is a kink in the screen There is a flaw in the design -- either the carafe is too narrow, or the plunger mechanism is too wide."
2,Less than expected,"Bummer, I was hoping for a nice press pot that would hold my coffee hot while I drank it slowly throughout the morning. It holds heat ok, but the screen on the darn thing doesn't work at all. Grounds all up in my coffee. I like the fact that it is unbreakable and is insulted enough to find a different screen and replace it.Other than the screen it gets a good recommendation from me"
3,Great except for the screen,Everything about it works great except the screen gets kinks on the edges very easily. Thermos gladly replaced the screen once for me already. However a few days after installing the new one is has two kinks in it. It appears that the design of the top of the carafe causes the screen to be caught unless the press is removed by tilting it as it is removed.
3,Grinds,This press does indeed keep the coffee warmer than the traditional glass Bodem presses. It is easy to clean. My only issue is that many grinds escape the screen in the pressing process. I have incrementally changed from a medium-fine grind to a coarse grind and have added a second screen to the press plunger and still get grinds in the brew when I pour a cup. Is anyone else experiencing this and have you found a solution?
3,Nice LITTLE coffee pot!,"This is a great LITTLE coffee pot - wish it was bigger. It actually holds 4.5 cups of coffee and I could use at least an 8 cup, but, we make it work!"
5,Better than Bodum,"I would highly recommend this product. After breaking three of the beakers from the Bodum french press, I decided to look for something stronger. Thank you, Stainless-Steel! I think the coffee is just as good if not better."
2,Good idea poor execution,"I'm being generous giving this product two stars. First, it keeps coffee warm for an hour only if completely full. If it's less then full you have maybe 20 minutes. Second, an more importantly is the problem with the screen. The product was almost unusable from the start. After an hour with needle nose pliers I finally got the screen straight enough to make it usable. You know when the screen is kinked again when you get a mouth full of grounds. Seriously for then price of this item; skip it."
5,Great Coffee Press,"This is my first French/Coffee Press, but it has been impressive. It makes two large mugs of coffee, which is perfect for me, one to wake up on and one for the ride to work. Unbreakable insulated steel keeps the coffee warm until I need it. Clean up is quick and the materials are very high quality. I can't think of a way to improve it."
4,Just what i wanted,works great keeps coffee hot long enough for me let stand for an hour and it was still hot. filter works ok but will un screw if you mess with it left coffee in it for a few days to season the stainless and get rid of the metallic flavor from the first pot
2,Coffee pot leaks!,"My husband and I purchased this item in February after breaking the class in our old french press coffee pot--again. We thought this product would avoid breakage, but now we have a pot that leaks (below the spout) when the coffee or tea is poured into a cup. Needless to say, we are not as please as we hoped we would be with this item, and there is no way for us to know if this can be fixed under the warranty. Up until now, we've been happy with our purchases through Amazon, but this has soured our experience."
3,"Adequate, but not revolutionary.","We purchased this French press to replace one that had started letting too many grounds through. As we looked at possible replacements, we thought this was a chance to solve the problem of the coffee going cold too fast (before you're ready for the next cup). This model does a better job of keeping the coffee warm, but it still cools faster than one would wish. Given how well Thermos flasks work, it's surprising that this product doesn't do a better job of keeping the coffee hot. Presumably it has something to do with the lid, and the size of the neck (but that's just a guess). We'll keep using it (and it should be great when camping), but it's not the final answer to the problem of cold coffee."
3,"Not bad, not great.","Before I purchased this item I reviewed several comments from others as well as comments concerning like items. While there were not nearly as many reviews for the Thermos coffee press I felt, all things considered, I should take a chance on this one. While it does make a very good cup of coffee it is nothing to brag about. As I am sure is true with all the others, as well. Mostly typical fad hype which will wear away with time and tide. GOOD: It does make as good coffee as my Black & Decker four-cupper and keeps it hot much longer than the B&D without electricity. BAD: The silly effort it takes requires 'way too much time, there are grounds in the poured beveage,it drips and it is a bear to clean properly. I suspect people tire of using a frog press pretty soon after the novelty wears off but at least with the Thermos I can use it AS a thermos to keep coffee, tea, cocoa, soup & I-don't-know-whatall hot for a reasonably long period. So, in retrospect, it's OK but nothing special."
2,Coounter-intuitive?,"the initial idea one gets with this pot is...finally, a way to keep my coffee hot.........but wait....what about the brew's additional steeping time? just because the grounds have been separated from the brew does not mean that there isn't additional extraction. Solving the French press dilemma involves getting a separate insulated carafe. I use acarafe that was left from a broken drip coffee maker. It holds 10 cups and is fine for the french press brew.The initial Nissan brew was quite good...the pot is also extremely well built and it does keep the brew warm for long periods...the over-steeping was my problem. Nice idea...flawed in use"
2,Does not keep hot for very long,"I was hoping this would keep my tea hot for the morning, but just Luke warm after an hour. I use it for loose leaf tea. A lot of the leaves go thru the sides of the mesh. I also have problems with the cover leaking when pouring."
2,great idea bad design,"I read the reviews about the filter not being great and letting grounds past and disreguarded them as being overly picky people who aren't used to french press silt in the bottom of every cup. This is in reality a really badly designed pot. I've already written to Thermos to recomend a redisign. The basic problem is that the sides of the pot are not even and straight they have this big space that is wider than the filter screen at the top so if it is at all close to a full pot as much as 1/3 of the grounds leak around when you push down the plunger. Also the screen filter gets creases so even if you don't make a full pot the grounds come through. Also I kind of expected it to be spill proof or vacumed sealed, it is not. I expected a lot more from it being a Thermos. If you buy one buy yourself a tea strainer and don't plan on taking it in the car."
1,Thermos Nissan 34 oz. French Press,"I wish I hadn't spent my money on this press. We could have opted for a little more expensive one, uninsulated, and done better for sure. We get a lot of grounds in our coffee- more than with other presses I've owned. I am back to using the one cup cones to brew my coffee rather than mess with the press in the mornings. The main issue is that there are all these little creases in the filter that recur every time we use the press even if I reshape it afterward. Grounds slip through where it poorly seals against the sides of the press. In addition we don't really need the insulation because we drink the coffee fast enough that it doesn't matter. Anyway-- wish I'd bought something else."
2,"Great concept, poor execution",Seemed like a great idea so I ordered one which is now on the way back to Amazon. The plunger screen allows grounds to get around the side and ultimately into your mug.
4,Coffee delight,"PROS: very well made, keeps coffee warm, and makes great coffee.CONS: coffee grounds get around metal mesh filter."
4,Very happy with this item,"I really like this coffee press. I end up zapping my coffee in the microwave anyway, so wasn't looking for something to keep it warm for hours, just long enough to pour into my cup! I love the fact that I can't break any more glass parts! It's really easy to clean too. My only niggles are that it lets more coffee grinds through, so I use a tea strainer when I pour the coffee, and you can't see how much is left in the pot (because there is no glass which I would otherwise break!)."

5,The truth behind the criticisms :-),"The REAL reason a lot of the people here are 'criticizing' PS2 is to spread bad feeling about it, to drive down the feeding-frenzy. This way THEY hope to have an easier time getting one when it comes out. HAH!!! We're on to you man!! ;-)Either that, or they don't want their precious DreamCasts to be made extinct by a superior platform (in terms of support and extensibility).I, for one, CAN'T WAIT to get my hands on GT2000!!!!But when it comes down to it, you really can't tell the future with these things until you've actually seen it, and it's already been in the market for a while. Now I gave it a 5, but to be honest that's just a gut feeling. NONE of us can really rate the American version of the PS2, cuz NONE of us have even SEEN it.-Good things come to those who wait-"
2,Hmm..,"Well...I keep seeing something in all these reviews of the ps2. Basically, the power of it and the DVD player. Who cares about these things? SNES was an inferior machine to the Genesis and it still went out on top eventually. The Gameboy has been around forever with stoneage hardware and its still popular as hell. I guess my point is that the specs don't really matter, and its really all about the games. Look at the PS2 launch list. Virtually all of them are sequels or blatant rip offs of already made games. Dreamcast has no quality games? Where have you been?Under a rock? Here are just a few off the top of my head: Soul Calibur, Resident Evil Code Veronica, Marvel Vs Capcom 2, Sega GT, Nfl2k1, NBA2k, UFC, etc. I do have to admit though, there are some games which look impressive on the PS2. But the main fact is, the Dreamcast will still be a contender and the PS2 will fight too, the winner? Who knows."
1,IT STINKS BAD!!!!!!!!!!!,"I WAS ON A RECENT TRIP TO JAPAN ON BUSINESS, THIS GAME SYSTEM IS GARBAGE!!MORE VIOLENCE IN THE MINDS OF MORE CHILDREN.DON'T BUY IT SAVE YOUR MONEY"
1,Not nearly as good as a Dreamcast.,"I have played the PS2 and it has graphics that appear to be better than the dreamcast. It does this by using more polygons to show detail. The main problem with the system is that it has so little memory. It cannot handle alot of the stuff the Dreamcast can. For instance Jet Grind Radio could never work on the PS2 because of how large the textures and how detailed the shadowing is. The Dreamcast can show just as much Detail as the PS2 buy using larger more vivid textures. But more than that it can handle alot that the PS2 cannot. There is also hardly any decent looking games that are coming out for the PS2. Metal Gear Solid will be good sure. But name another decent title. It's pretty hard. Combine that with the lack of decent third party support for RPG's (squaresoft, what a joke.) Not to mention that the way it plays DVD movies is horrible. There is now way that this system will outlast the Dreamcast."
2,DC is way better,"Before I start I just wanna say that I am not biased towards Sony b'cuz I own the original PSX and still love it. However my hopes for the PS2 are very dim. Sony just seems to be working so hard on the DVD movie compatability and not the actual games. The PS2 just lacks the game quality that the DC has. Most of the them are just rehashes of PSX games. DC has way more value even at a price 1/2 of PS2's $300 tag. The PS2 also has only 2 controller ports and no VMUs. The DC has 4 controller ports and VMUs that can be used to secretly call plays in football games. The last thing that makes DC a way better system is that it comes w/ a 56K modem and plans for broadband are already underway. PS2 has nothing of that sort. So are you gonna pass up internet games like NFL2K1, NBA2K1, Unreal: Tournament, Quake 3: Arena to play Tekken Tag and Ridge Racer 5? I hope not."
1,Evil Over-Hyped DVD Player,Sony is a big electronics glutton who knows nothing about true video games. I urge you to please resist all this crazy hype and get yourself a real game console like the Dreamcast or GAMECUBE. PLAYSTATION(2) IS EVIL!!!
4,Playstation 2 not a Sega Dreamcast Killer,"Some of the games for the playstation 2 will be incredible. But people are underestimating the power of the playstation 2. People are saying that the playstation 2 will destroy Dreamcasts' graphic engine. The playstation has a good graphic engine because i own one. I bought at an import video game store. The games are awesome but they don't show the power sony and the public promised. They promised a gaming experience like no other but it has not. The Dreamcast and Playstation 2 are two excellent systems, but it's not what people expected because some of the games for Dreamcasts have awesome graphics and i've yet to see a game PS2 outdo a Sega Game."
5,This is best System in this generation,"When chosing a system you have 4 choices: PS2, Dreamcast, Dolphin, or X-Box.Well you can quickly eliminate the dreamcast because the day PS2 is launced, it's down the drain.The dolphin is undesired by me and many other gamers because, the details about it are so few and far between. I mean we havent even seen it's spec's yet, and they say it will be launched by christmas. (yeh dream on!)Now getting to the respectable X-Box. It's spec's are better than the PS2's but... In microsoft's current situation and, the limited company's that have confirmed they accutally will make games for it does not seem something I'd invest my hard earned cash on.Finally the PS2. After seeing the screens form the launch titles and doing a little research this the system I will buy. With the PS2 you get a DVD player, backward compatibility, and some of the best games made by my favorite software company's like: Bungie, Acclaim, and Electronic Arts. Enough said!"
4,ps2 is not the best toy in the world,ps2 needs better games and graphics. If you're getting a game system get xbox or gamecube
4,Playstation 2,"I havn't buy the Playstation 2 yet I am thinking about getting one, But all my friends has one. So that's all I have to say for now.Timika,"
3,Correction to the Correction,"1. First off Dreamcast games arent on Cd-Roms, they are on GD-Roms which can hold a gig of info...2. Have you ever heard of VCD...yes thats right, you cat put an entire movie on 2 CD's....and no a average DVD is 2.8 gigs....3. Ive played PS2, and let me tell you...the graphics are still kinda choppy...and the dvd players is software based so it will never be as good as a true DVD player....4. Ive heard rumors of sega coming out with a DVD player that is not software based to accompany the dreamcast console....if this happens dreamcast will once again reign supreme as it should the greatest game console ever....that is until x box comes out...THANK YOU"
1,who cares,"It might be the best game in town but who cares you cant get one for x-mass. I say shame on sony for making a limited supply and disapointing all those little kids out there. I may have to go with the gas powered scooter for x-mass and pass on sony altogether. This stuff happenes every year with some stupid toy and we as parents go nuts looking for it. well I am over it I say who cares, Nntendo will out do it by the time they hit the market anyway."
2,Why buy a unit with out a remote,My girl and i wanted a DVD player and a Sony Playstation and so we Felt that the PS2 would solve all our problems. Not true. the PS2 has some Neat Qualities But yet is very limited in its user friendlyness. You will find yourself almost getting devorced over who is going to press the play button on the DVD player. At this time until Sony comes out with something Better I would buy 2 seperate units. Its not all its cracked up to be especially in our Lazy society today where we need a remote for everything. Heck if sony realy wants to impress me they will make a remote flusher for my Toilet.
3,Will be waiting...,"Personally, I think that waiting until after x-mas 2000 will be well worth it because the overload of PS2's will force Sony to drop prices for the US market. $199 anyone??? I am always disappointed when I buy a platform for the initial price (bought a Dreamcast last X-mas for my son) only to find out the price goes way-way down after the new year.I have always been impressed with the quality of the games that are published for the PS1 and the reverse compatability feature without having to modify my system or mess with boot disks is very handy as I think my PS1 is on its last legs from HEAVY usage.My advice- wait until the price is below $200 before you buy- and the more people that wait, the sooner the price will come down."
3,"Good, but I've played better","I've played a Jap import PS2, and I've got to admit; I was impressed. The graphics kicked butt, and I enjoyed using the analog controllerss, which seem really cool. But go a bit deeper into the system, and a few flaws satrt to appear. First, no FSAA, which makes the diagonal lines, such as on a stairway, seem jagged. Second, I experianced some problems with the DVD-ROM drive, the loading times for my system were much longer that I had believed them to be. And last but certinly not least, the selection of games avible at the moment. Allmost everything is a PSX game with better graphics. I have no doubt that some time next years, better and more original games will start coming out, but for now, I'd stick with the good old relible dreamcast."
2,WAIT,"Before rushing out and buying this over hyped DVD player/games machine save your money.The machine is not all it seems, it is very difficult to program and many developers are struddling to produce games that match the visual quality of the Dreamcast although I'm sure they will improve. Sony has lost sight of what makes a good console and its lack of inovative software is worrying.The companies attitude towards Retailers and its consumer base is also poor with the badly handled ordering system and the cut in quantities available. The price seems very high at $299 considering that both X-Box and Gamecube are promising to undercut and the Dreamcast is at a very resonable $149 with internet access. I for one will wait and see if it can live up to the hype or get buried by it."
1,Wait for X-Box,"Just a message for those consumers that were hoping to get a PS2 before Christmas until they cut the release number in half. I am one of those people and if I don't get it by January 1, 2001, I will simply wait for the far superior X-Box release in October 2001. Anyone with any common sense will do the same. The X-Box will make the PS2 look like an Atari, trust me. This marketing blunder by Sony will certainly cost them a large chunk of the market, and may end up leading to their demise, with more powerful systems like the Dolphin and X-Box just months away."
2,VERY OVER-RATED!,"Now, don't get me wrong. The Playstation 2 has some pretty nice graphics...128 bits to be exact. The Dreamcast came out over a year ago with equally impressive garphics. Looks like Sony is running a liitle behind. The main reason that I gave it such a low rating is due to the [price] tag on it. I realize that this extremely steep price is due to it having a built-in DVD player. I, however, refuse to pay such a price for a game system paralleled with my Dreamcast, and a DVD player that I already have! Sony didn't think about pricing very well. I'll be sure to raise my rating when the price drops [down] (probably within 6 mos. knowing the video game industry). Bottom line...save some money...buy a Dreamcast (with a few choice games such as Soul Calibur, Shenmue, and Sega GT)."
5,"correction,","Dreamcast games are on gd-roms, which can hold more than conventinal cd's but, the playstation 2 dvds can also hold over 17Gb on 1 disc (you could acctually put a whole ff series 1-8 on 2 discs if you wanted to) so the dvd holds more"
1,way too over-rated.,It ain't even out yet and people are already giving it 5 stars. Give me a break. Enthusiasm is not a proper way to rate it.
5,the playstation only better,"First of all, the playstation was the best system ever made, the N64 uses cartridges, and that means no movies and limited graphics quality, and no real rpgs. and then the dreamcast hasn't put out and impressive games, just the same old thing, and also that controller of theirs, bad, very bad, i cant stand that system. and its sega! haha, how long is that gonna last, haha. so basically, playstation was the best. and now the playstation two is a better playstation, so its gonna be the best, not only does it have better everything hardware wise than dreamcast, but it has more games, better games, and upgrade ability. this system will never die. and for the x-box, can you say microsoft? i have spoken"
3,FUN NOT POWER,"The ps2 looks good, but i hoped much moore, just remember the important are the games not the power of a console"
1,Megahype!,"The PS2 is just a hype. I played Tekken Tag at a store. To tell you the truth, I walked out thinking it was great. Then, I played Tekken 3 on PSX. You know what-it was better. Tekken Tag had MORE glitches, graphics that were only a little improved, and the ""tag"" feature just confused me. Even though it was one of the first batch of Japanese systems it wasn't that great. Also, I played with a normal dual shock controller, so there's no reason to buy another. That's probably the only good part."
