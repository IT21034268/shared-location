1,good girl's do-it-yourself guide,"This book is awful and a waste of time and money. It's also incredibly shallow, focusing mostly on clearing out your closet and performing the ""fun"" exercises she describes on yourself. The author also makes such a point of being a surrogate partner for a sex therapist. Isn't that basically a prostitute??? Don't waste any energy on this book."
3,HOT SEX,"I'm hoping to wed a woman I love who's been trapped in a marriage with a guy light years below her intellect. She considers herself ""straight-laced"" and in the interests of better orgasms, I bought her a copy of The Good Girl's Guide which, of course, I read before sending it to her. This is not a prurient narrative intended to tittelate but rather a useful and at times amusing work aimed at enhancing the perhaps socially conservative woman's sexual experiences. It's not Hugh Hefner, Masters & Johnson, or that Indian Indian classic with all the positions. It's a pragmatic look at human sexuality with suggestions about how to improve one's sexual encounters. Recommended."
1,maybe I'm too much of a bad girl already...,"...but there was nothing particularly new in this book, or anything particularly surprising. This book MAY be helpful to some as a first step, but it most likely isn't a crucial read for those of us who are already satisfied with our sex lives and just looking to add a little extra spice."
4,it's helpful for younger girls,it's helpfuli see many reviews saying it's teaching them stuff they already know but it's like what the title said THE GOOD GIRL'S GUIDE like maybe for younger girls who's fairly new to sex.
1,Horrible,Would never recommend. Waste of time and money. Would learn more from my mother and she's a nun! (not really but that's how I feel) very disappointing.
3,Decent read with some very good advice,"This book contains a great deal of good advice about how to feel good about yourself and therefore be more attractive to others. However, it is written for a very specific kind of woman - Keesling even says that outright - and that type seems to be suburban soccer mom. Though I am very aware that I do not fit into this demographic, I still found many of her exercises and insights to be helpful, physically and psychologically.On a completely separate note, I really didn't like her writing style. The use of exclamation points and leading questions is rather overwhelming and distracting. If it weren't for my aversion to her style, I would have given it a higher rating."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!,"Perhaps if you've never had sex before this book might have some value, but if you have - forget it. I would provide some quotes if I could, but I already threw the book out. Unbelievably lame - so sorry I spent the money. If I could choose zero stars instead of one - I would."
3,fun,"fun read, very practical (and practicable), good tips, bad girls are not trashy, think about leading from your hip bones when you walk"
1,Not useful,"Don't even bother. I was hoping for some tips to liven things up and ended up with a primer for basics that well, if you don't know them are helpful. This is not a guide for ""bad girl sex"" at all. It's just your basic sex guide that could be helpful to anyone just starting out, not looking to add to their bag of tricks."
4,Guide to being Sexy and Flirty,"This is the book I was looking for. I looked for books on flirting to try and find out how to communicate desire wordlessly. This has been a problem for me as I have never been the girl who acts sexy. When I was in my 20s I had the advantage of a killer body, but now I want to have the whole package.This is not about how to meet men, though it will certainly help. This is about how to act in a way that creates heat without being trashy. Also has a lot of good advice for the sexually inhibited."
3,OK,"Okay as a confidence booster, good ways to get you back into ""sexy mode"" but definitely has some weird exercises."
4,Great Scent,"I purchased this product because I heard so much about it. I have used it twice and love the scent. I am still not sure about how well it works with my hair type. I have very tightly curled hair with various textures (varying between 4a and 4b type). It does soften it some but I can not use it alone. I need a Hair oil or butter for my hair to retain the moisture. Since, I am transitioning from a relaxer, it would have been nice to know how to use this product with other Carol's daughter products for transitioning."
1,Don't know what the hype is about Carol's Daughter,"I bought this product in a set and couldn't wait to use it once I got home. Shampooed my hair with the black vanilla shampoo and then tried out the black vanilla leave in conditioner. this product seemed to dry my hair out and did not help detangle it at all. I wear a short hairstyle and rarely have to worry about detangling my hair. I would not recommend this product to a friend, hell I wouldn't recommend this to a enemy. Carol's Daughter is just a phase that everyone is trying out."
3,spray hair perfume,"I bought this product because an easy to use, nice smelling leave-in conditioner. This product fulfills my needs, except I have one concern: usually products that have a strong (yet pleasant!) scent are drying. Therefore, use sparingly just before blow drying, and don't expect your dead ends to heal from use of this product. You'll have a nice smelling head though! FYI, product scent does not stink up the room, as far as I can tell. Scent will stay close to your head."
4,Revived Curls,"I received my Black Vanilla Leave-In Conditioner yesterday. Considering I ordered this product on New Year's Eve, it was an incredibly LONG wait to receive this product. Nonetheless, I tried it out on my 3c/4a hair last night. The smell is tolerable (kinda earthy) and my bottle leaks if it's laying on it's side. I sprayed this on sections of hair before I dry flat twisted. It doesn't leave a build up and the spray concentrates the product exactly where I want it. This morning, I took out my twists and I must say, they had more ""spring to them"" and they were soft too. I may have found a great leave in...."
4,Works wonders!,"My daughter has curly thick hair. After washing and towel drying, all I have to do is spray this on a section of her hair and volia....I can COMB through her hair with no problems!! This is a life saver. Love the smell...vanilla but not overly sweet. I will definately be purchasing more!"
1,save your money!,"this stuff is awful and dried my (natural 4a) hair out! a crunchy dried mess it was. save your cash, people!"
3,Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Leave-In Conditioner,"I had bought this conditioner before and loved it. So i purchased a second bottle and something happened with its smell. It was a very nice vanilla smell , strong at first but vanished quickly into a soft smell. Now it smells not like vanilla, but all plastic-artificial like. I will not buy this product any more."
2,Not as good as it sounds,"I purchased this in a set and must say was disappointed in the results. It was packaged beautifully and could not wait to use it so I shampooed that night and conditioned my hair. I sprayed in the CD Leave in and my hair only felt wet with a strong smell of vanilla. It did not detangle all that well and I did not feel as though my hair was moisturized after using it. It was like spritzing vanilla scented water in my hair more than conditioning. After blow drying, my hair felt stripped and looked rather dry. Not a fan of CD and will not purchase again."
1,A disappoinment,"I have relaxed hair, and was thoroughly disappointed with this CD product. My hair was left tangled and the scent is overwhelming. I have had better results with the Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner. Unlike the results from the black vanilla leave-in conditioner, my hair was no more thangled than ususal and I was not overwhelmed by the scent. I enjoyed the herbaceous, floral, and refreshing scent. This is my hair ritual: deep cleasing shampoo, Khoret Amen shampoo, Pantene relaxed and natural breakage defense hair mask, Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner, KA hair oil, and Carol's Daughter hair milk. The results were smooth, soft, manageable, and great smelling hair."
1,It ruins my hair!!!!,"Oh my goodness, i dont know what's the buzz with Carol's Daughter products but I've tried their body scrub and body shouffle. They didn't smell good and didn't moisturize good. But I thought I'd try their leave in conditioner, seeing all the good reviews on their website.And now it's drying my hair so bad!!! My hair looks like a witch's hair now thanks a lot Carol and Lisa! What a complete waste of money!"
1,"Oh,i wish",I loved this product as much as other...I wanted to I really did but it left my hair so dry like weeds or hay I I had to wear my hair it in a pony tail and then a lot of my hair came out because of the dryness. I'm not sure who hair this is made for but not mine and I have curly hair so I thought it would be perfect. Better luck next time...
3,Very Strong vamilla smell,"This smells good, but the smell is very strong. I don't really want my daughter going around smelling like cookies all day. Also it's expensive, and didn't detangle that well. I switched back to Johnson and Johnson's detangler which is about 1/3 the price, doesn't have a smell and works much better"
5,"Carol's Daughter, Black Vanilla Leave-in Conditioner.","I bought this for my husband and he loves it This conditioner has been a staple in our house for quite some time. It smells really good and leaves hair soft and manageable. I would recommend Black Vanilla to anyone with dry, damaged or brittle hair."
2,Tangled up my hair even moe,"I was looking for a leave in conditioner that I could use on both wet and dry hair. I have very curly hair and a lot of it, and I have very hard time brushing it when wet...this product made brushing MUCH harder and I ended up with a comb full of hair by the time I was done....I really wanted to like but have to give it 2 stars...The smell is great, but it lingers on for days and will interfere with any other scents you put on."
5,A Pure Party,Nice mix of Disco and Hip Hop.This one has every song is banging god bless the old school hip hop days from the beginningThis.If you want to here some good hip hop try listening to this.Bump this in your stereo imediately.-Good day
3,You'd better buy another launch title...,"Well, if someone is reading this, that person must be wondering which lauch title to pick. I had the opportunity to try this game via my friend's gameboy advance, and I was quite disappointed. First of all, the visibility is bad. The screen and graphics are way to dark so we end up dying just because we didn't see an enemy who blended in the background. And, there's no saving feature, not even password so you must finish the game in one sitting. Anyway, this game wasn't so great on the SNES, so why bother?"
3,Needs a SAVE feature!!,"I bought this game because I used to have the OLD Atari version, and wanted to see how they could update it. The gameplay itself is pretty fun, but visibility is poor, especially in the third level mineshafts. Also, every time I turn on the darn thing, I have to start over from the beginning. That gets old really fast. Other than that, the graphics are great, and it's not difficult to play...but then again, I keep playing the same levels over and over and over..."
3,Little harder than I was looking for in a GBA game,"If I was playing this on N64 or XBox or PS2 or something this game would be great. Don't get me wrong, it is a very good game - it is just a little harder than I was looking for in a GBA game. Usually you play (or at least I do) a Game Boy Advance game because you are looking for some quick fun entertainment during lunch or during work when no one is looking. This game takes more time than I can devote to it usually. The graphics are outstanding the the game play is very very good. I just have a hard time at the end of the levels when you have to kill whatever is trying to eat you. That is where I don't have the patience to continue. Either that - or I just suck at it. It is a very well done game and worth playing, especially if you have more skills than I do. Just wish there was a little more screen to see what you are doing."
3,Okay Game!,"This is an okay game because I bought it here online for [$]. If I paid full price for it, then I would be a little upset. It does has it's flaws and can very frustrating at times."
1,pitfall is fun to play but...,I have played Pitfall for 2 weeks now and it is a fun game that plays well but having to start over each time i turn the game off is a real downer. you cannot save any games. its fun to play but you have to go through each level over and over and over instead of having a save. therefore its only a two week game. i am ready bored of it and want to give it away..
3,NOT TOO SHABBY,"This being the only GBA game I own so far,I dont have much to compare it by.But I think it was a good buy.It was sort of colorful,graphics were alright,the story was simple.Wait a minute I changed my mind,This game wasnt all that and it was weird.Sure it had color,but thats only if you held it right up to the light.The light that I bought in fact specifically for the GBA,and it didn't even work right.Why do I even bother?Im color blind anyway.There is absolutely no point to the game,its not even challenging![....]"
3,No save feature,"This game is an OK game. The gameplay is fun and bosses are hard. But the graphics are way muddy and you need almost perfect light to see. There is no music or anything to make the gameplay a little more intersting. And the most frustrating thing of all is there is no save feature. If you die and have no more continues, even if your about to beat the game, it just starts right over. Buy it if you like, but I wouldn't recomend it."
1,This Game ...Stinks!!!!!!!!,This game is terrible Don't buy it. It is dark so you can't find the enemies. There is no saving feature. Don't buy it at all costs.
1,"I hate to write a bad review, but...","I love Indian romances and I thought that this one would be no exception. Boy, was I ever wrong! Could it be any more poorly written? This is my first and last Karen Kay book."
2,VACU VIN RAPID ICE WINE CHILLS WINE???????,"I really have my doubts about this thing. I've had it for a couple years and I keep it in the freezer but I've not found it to be very fast (5 minutes) chilling a bottle of wine. I'd say more like at least 1/2 hour. I am also perplexed as to whether the liquid in the sleeve is supposed to stay in a liquid state or, after being in the freezer is it supposed to be more rigid and and solid. The liquid in mine stays liquid, no matter how long it is kept in the freezer. It didn't come with any explanation as to how it works or if the liquid is to become fairly solid when frozen. If it indeed is supposed to be more frozen or like an ice cube, mine is then defective. I doubt I'd buy another one."
5,Works great!,"I've only used this a few times, but it works very well! I even chilled a warm water bottle to a near icy-drink in just a few minutes. I did find that it works much faster if you put the chiller around the drink, and then stick them in the freezer together. This way, in a few minutes you can chill down a bottle from room temperature.But if you just want to keep your already-chilled bottle cold, this works like a charm. Good price, too!"
3,Haven't really used,I have not had a chance to use this product yet. I am looking forward to seeing how well it works.
2,Doesn't stay cold long,I was disappointed in this wine cooler. It thaws out quickly--especially outdoors. I think the insulation is too thin or something along those lines. We've had similar ones before and they seemed to do a better job.
2,wine chiller does not chill,"I have used this wine chiller a couple of times. If the wine is already cool, it holds the temperature pretty well, but does not do a lot if the wine is warm."
4,Great for People Who Don't Plan Ahead,"These wine chillers are great for when you're already half way through dinner and think ""Oh, but some wine would be nice with that."" We're big fans of very cold white wine, and this has worked great for us.One caveat-- it claims to be unbreakable, and it may be hard to break, but if you drop it on a hardwood floor while it's still frozen, it will break open. However, I think it's unlikely it would break under any circumstances other than dropping or being hit by something heavy."
2,Disappointing,"The product described as chilling wine in five minutes. The ""chiller"" had been in my freezer for a couple of days, but did not chill the room temperature bottle of wine."
4,Great way to keep your whites chilled,"We keep this in our freezer at all times so whenever we need to chill a bottle of wine quickly we have it available. I'm not sure I would say it is able to chill a bottle of wine in 5 minutes, but it does cool it down pretty quickly. I think the best use I've found for it is to keep wine chilled rather than having to continually put the bottle back into the fridge. This comes in very handy when you are entertaining. I actually just recently purchased another one because we like it so much. Every bottle we have tried fits fine in the sleeve, but I could see how some non-standard, wide bottles may have issues fitting."
2,Doesn't work as advertised,"This made my wine cooler, but the freezer still does a better job at a faster speed (although not fast enough). The wine never reached a drinkable temp. Very disappointed."
2,Disappointing Content,"I found this book to be pretty much a rerun of previous editions. The primary reason I bought this ""Linux 7.1 Bible"" is that by the name I thought it would cover this Linux release including all new additions. The main thing I was looking for was a good explantion of iptables and how to correctly use them since this is supposed to replace ipchains and be much more powerful. What I found was the author mentions that iptables is the newest firewall configuration tool and is to replace ipchains and here's the website for the How To (which I had already visited) and in this book we'll explain once again how to setup ipchains (which he just said was being replaced). If you don't have other books on installing and setting up previous versions of Linux this book might do, but if you want information on the new additions to the 7.x versions don't waste your money like I did."
1,NOT a good book on Redhat 7.1,"This book is supposed to cover Redhat 7.1 and yet they have screenshots from 5.x or 6.x. They don't go over any of the new GUI tools (apacheconf, bindconf, etc.) I want to see a book that covers what it is supposed to, and not recycle a bunch of old info and put it in a new book. Very disapointed... :("
3,Huge book!,"Good book specially if you are totally new to Linux, like me. It doesn't have a lot of command line examples though -- then again this is not a reference book -- I'd also like to see more screenshots. In many instances, the author refers to Redhat Linux 7.1 as ""OpenLinux"", which is another comapany's (Caldera) Linux distribution. Many of the procedures on the book don't work at all when you run them on RH 7.1."
3,"The CD's are great, but the book, well........","I am a beginner to the world of UNIX and Linux, so I decided to buy a book on Red Hat w/ the required software since I had heard so much about this particular distribution. The first two chapters of the book are great, especially in the amount of detail the author provides for installing Red Hat. However, the book goes down hill from there. I feel that it does not sufficiently cover significant parts of the GNOME and KDE Desktop environments and I find my self thinking ""Huh?"", many times throughout the chapters that follow. Like I said in the title though, the CDs have got some great stuff on them. The book is worth buying just becuase of the Red Hat software on them. If you bought the equivalent software in the store, it would be a little spendy. So basically, buy the book for the instructions on installation and the actual OS, but then toss the book and go find something of better quality."
3,The book was a-ight.,"I thought that the women in this book gave all women sort of bad name. I found it hard to stay in tune to. The one thing, the only thing which connected these women is that they are totally dependent on men. They all seem so helpless. Gloria Naylor's writing style is so un-realistic at times it makes absolutly no sense. I personally would not recommend this to other high school kids. Honestly I think they'd be bored out of their minds."
3,Not quite what you may expect.,"The description of this item says that it contains Trios by Max Bruch for clarinet, viola, and piano, and Carl Reinecke for clarinet, horn, and piano, however all the pieces on this CD are performed by clarinet, viola and piano. This was quite a disappointement, and while the performance was energetic, the tone quality of the clarinet came across as a bit harsh and overpowering, with excessive vibrato use. The viola tended to get covered up in general, and didn't come across as having a characteristically rich sound. Still, technically well done."
3,"Good playing, poor recording...","On this cd are some of horn literature's finest compositions for horn quintet. While the performances were good (not great) the recording quality on this album left a lot to be desired. The recording sounded as if it were made in one of those cramped university practice rooms with the sound deadening panels on every inch of the 5 foot walls. If you want a recording of the Reicha that will groove, go for Baumann's rendition. This album simply lacks the upbeat musical character that Baumann gives so well. While the notes were there, I'm afraid the jovial French-style spirit was somehow lost in this recording. The interpretation of the Mozart was interesting, but not quite what I have seen actually printed on any edition of this piece. Though lacking in some areas for my taste, it's still a good chance to hear some rarely performed quality chamber works for horn and strings."
4,mystery,I absolutely adore old mystery movies. This one is great. Some things you see coming and others you don't. Enjoy it.
3,Moontide,"Jean Gabin's debut & penultimate US film. He's quite good in an English-speaking role; it's a shame he & Hollywood just weren't into each other. His Dali-esque drunken blackout scene is really trippy. Lovable Mitchell works great cast against type as the psycho leach whose obsession w/ Gabin is, er, suspicious. Lupino & Claude Rains do wonders w/ poorly-written parts..."
3,Who Killed Pop Kelly ?,"This is an interesting flop of a film.This was French superstar Jean Gabin's American film debut. He made only one more film in America that was even less successful than this one before he returned to France for good in 1944.Strange casting of Claude Rains, against type, doesn't fly.I didn't buy the chemistry between Gabin and his co-star Ida Lupino. The story is dreamy, unrealistic and overly romaticized and it just doesn't gel.Great lighting by Charles Clark creates all the right moods, but the total impact of the film is undermined with too many feel good concessions in the final frames."
3,anybody had problem with dvd freeing up on the last quarter?,"Great movie,except couldn'd watch last quarter.dvd frooze up and could not see how it ended.anybody else have a problem?"
1,Horton's Agony of Deceit a Bummer,"This book deserves zero stars. Aside from a couple of good essays in it, this is one of the worst books I have ever read. In the name of protecting Christianity from frauds, Horton goes way beyond that to subtly undermine any trust in the Bible at all. He shreds miracle and despises the Scientific Creationists. When he is done you wouldn't dare trust ANYTHING about Christianity! Read this book only if you like pious-sounding frauds."
1,Stinks,"Most of the contributors to this book should spend more time in earnest research instead they seem to only take excerpts from different writings of the men they are judging or grading. These contributors take a few words from the material and then twist it or mold it into something totally different from what was actually said. They only publish the negative and don't look at the positive. Kinda like giving a child a sucker stick without the candy. It is a shame when so called religious leaders stop leading and begin to slander others. Seems they are going against the teachings of Christ who they profess to be their leader.In summary if you are not getting enough negative material this book is for you, however; you may want to find something more uplifting to read.This book actually dosn't deserve the one star, but that is the lowest rating given for this review. Oh, what the heck I rate it a Zero."
5,What a beautiful book!,"Julia London is a gifted writer. This, her final book in the Rogues series, is as good if not even better than the first two. There are no dead spots in this book, just a few chapters at the start to put the scenario in place and then it is non-stop delight to the very last page. Arthur is a true heartthrob and Kerry is a smart, witty, delightful heroine. All the characters are well thought-out and depicted with affection and detail. The love scenes are sensual but done with impeccable taste. The very original plot is smart and not cliche-ridden. It is an emotional roller coaster, especially the last few chapters. I read it in two days. And I was busy at work!The only drawback to a writer who consistently hits it out of the park like Ms. London is that she truly crafts her novels and that takes time. How we all wish we could enjoy one of her books every month. But...she is well worth the wait."
2,A Very Disappointing Ending,"I had such high expectations for this third book after reading the first two, that I felt as though I was let down, just grasping for more...The first gripe that I have for this book is that the hero and the heroine do not meet each other until past page 60. Until then, the book is filled with excess hype, and the reader is left to wonder, ""When are they finally going to meet? Get on with the Love Story!""Secondly, there is no passion, no umph to their romance, like in the first two books.And Thirdly, the last 50 pages of this book is just awful! It's predictable, especially the courtroom scene, and it just drags on and on. After a while, I found myself skimming it because I just wanted this book to end!!This book is definately going into the local library book sale stack."
2,doesn't live up to expectations,"Arthur goes to Scotland to settle a matter for a dead friend. The matter involves Kerry (our heroine). Coincidentally the two meet without realizing who the other is and of course proceed to fall in love.This story had potential, but falls short. I found our heroine Kerry to be completely lackluster, especially towards the end. She is portrayed as a responsible person all through the beginning and then after one incident (I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who does read the book) she just pretty much walks away from everything, including herself. Very odd. I wasn't particularly fond of Arthur either - I found him to be a bit heavy handed.All in all the book was filled with coincidences and cliches. I'd recommend skipping it."
5,Fantastic !!!,"This is the best book that I have read in a long time. Julia London is definitely a rising star. The pace of the book is perfect ... never so slow that you lose interest, and yet Ms. London knows how to fill in the details that you won't want to miss. If only every day life could imitate the art that Ms. London so beautifully creates. ""The Beautiful Stranger"" is a book that you will absolutely want to recommend to all of your friends. All I can say is ... BRAVO Ms. London !!!"
4,great hair,"most of the bratz boyz's hair r hard to take care of. but, Dylan's is so much easier. my friends throw him around, but yet, his hair is still the way it was. This is such a great toy. by the way, the girl that is 13 going on 14, don't feel bad.because i am 11 going on 12, and i feel embarrased becuase i'm still playing with dolls. But it dosen't matter what other people think."
5,Dyan and Cameroon Personality !!!,"OH! How this doll shocks me when I see it. Its the first boy design to come as a doll. The one that intrest me the most is Dyan it has my eyes,lips,cheeks,nose,and skin type. It would be just like me if it had hair like cameroon only dark brown instead of light color. Everyone thinks that I'm the doll cause of my characteristic from the doll. I vote it the number #1 friend for kids who dont have brothers or sisters. When I study or do my homework I make him sit next to me on my desk. I cant wait to see if the next boy."
2,Great graphics do not make a good game,"The first time I laid eyes on Iridion for the GBA, my mouth watered when I saw the gorgous graphics and surprisingly realistic explosions. When I played it though, the experience became quite a different one. There are a lot of times when your ship blocks your view of what your shooting, and even when you can see what your shooting at you can't judge the distance, and with so much on screen action at once you will suffer a lot of cheap deaths. The control is awkward as well, and there are times when the game is just plain unforgiving. But like I said, the graphics are beautiful, so if you like games with gorgous graphics and real shallow gameplay, this is for you."
3,research this game before you buy,This game looks extremely impressive at first glance however don't be fooled by beautiful graphics. Most reviews of this game have shown that this game has horrible gameplay. This is one of those games that you should let your friends get first then test it and see if you like it. Don't judge a book by it's cover!
1,you'll Be Sorry,this game isn't what it seems. you'll be sorry on it's game play. it's grafic's are good if that's all you seek in a great playing game.
2,This game looks good on the box,"This game is not very much fun. I beat it in a day, the graphics on the game are dark in some levels. Also all the levels are the same. The only good parts are the bosses the graphics when fighting the bosses are good.The GBA has all these new buttons and this game doesen't even use them. The onle buttons used are the D-pad and the A button.This game is just a simpler form of the old sega game Afterburn. Only in Afterburn you get missles and can do more things than just move side to side."
1,dont sell this game,it is so hard and boring. all u do is fly around and shoot starfish and space junk. dont buy IT!!!!!
2,Why did i get this again?,"I bought my game boy advance and it came with Tony Hawk 2 and Iridon 3D. I played Tony Hawk first, it was great, I thought Iridon 3D would be good, IT WAS HORRIBLE! The story was so bad, it was worse then the cheap arcade game... I went and got Bomberman Tournament, it was so much better. I would not recommend this to anyone"
1,This game really ...,"When gameboy advance came out i wanted iridion 3d and tony hawk 2. ... So i got the f-zero game pack and tony. Few weeks later i went to blockbuster and rented it. I was so excited to play it. ...The graphics were really good but the game was so boring. The space shooting games on atari are even better. So, if your gonna get iridion 3d, first rent it. If you like it, buy it. If you dont, GET SOMETHING ELSE!"
1,It is a horrible game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"IT A HORRIBLE GAME!!!!!!!good graphics but, A HORRIBLE GAME!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY!!!!!!!!!!! IM CHEESED OFF AT MEJESTICO!!I Defiant NOT BUY!!If you dont believe me find a friend to get it and play his/hers."
3,"Houston, we have a problem. Our A button is wearing out!","Well, I can't lie. This game is not very good. If you like Star Fox, this should hold you until a better space shooting game comes out. You only use the A button. Thats it. Now for the good part. The grafix rock!! It is like playing a computer game. Really detailed and 3D envirnments give this game another star. If you really need a space shooter game for your GBA, go for it. But if you could care less on what tipe of game it is and you are only looking for a good, fun game, steer away from this game (if your controlls allow you to)."
2,The only thing Big K didn't mention . . .,. . . that you might want to know is that the girls don't get naked. They are topless.
2,Medium,"This dvd is nothing special at all, the commentary is quite annoying actually seems that he definitely didnt go to poker school....Apart from that the women in it are sensational and NO you dont get to see carmen electra strip..she is one of the hosts..."
5,Great spanish cookbook,This was such an asset to giving my daughter a spanish themed graduation party. This cookbook was not only that but the story of the restaurant which my family visited. The pictures in the book are great too.
3,...ok,"Once I received the book, it turned out to be more of a ""biography"" about the authors and their family history than cookbook. It's interesting, but not what I expected."
5,A cookbook with history,"I visited both the Columbia restaurant in Ybor City and in Clearwater,and I had to buy the book,the recipes are wonderful,specially the seafood dishes,but,what I liked the most was the actual story about Tampa and the family that owns the restaurants,I finished the book feeling like I knew the family since ever!!!.If you are not around Florida right now,I'll suggest you to buy the book,and if you are in Florida and anywhere close to any of the Columbia restaurants,make a dinner reservation right now!!,and then,buy the book."
5,Loved it,"Gift item, well recived. Do not know if he did any cooking from it, but he was impressed by the condition of it, since it was ""used"""
3,Just okay,"This elixir smells great and feels nice on the skin, but I guess I just don't understand it's purpose or how it benefits my skin. I won't be repurchasing this product."
4,WHO SAYS THERE'S NOTHING NEW?,"Who says there's nothing new under the sun or, in this case, under the grape arbor? In what can only be thought of as a serendiptious meeting in 1993 young Mathilde and Bertrand Thomas met a professor from Bordeaux University on the estate of the Chateau Smith Hunt Lafitte.From this chance meeting the couple learned that the professor had discovered that seeds thrown away at the close of a grape harvest contained anti-ageing properties. Following research, experimentation, and several patents, Caudalie was born.A favorite from this line is Beauty Elixir, part tonic, part serum. Use of toners has proven too harsh, having a tendency to dry skin while the Elixir softens.In addition to the Grape Extracts Beauty Elixir contains Vitamins A, B, and C, extracts of Myrrh, Orange and Rose Flower, and oils of Rosemary and Mint.The Elixir, for use on a cleansed skin under moisturizer, tightens pores and smoothes the complexion leaving skin with a natural glow."
2,Smells good but not exactly sure what's it's use,"I purchased this for longer flights which tend to dry out my skin. I usually use the Evian spray but opted for this due to the pleasant scent. Considering it's pricier, I would likely not purchase again because I don't think it adds much. The scent is nice and it does last for quite awhile."
5,it help me very much,i am in taiwan. and there are few movie poster information here. it provide me a lot of knowledge to know more deeply in movieposter. it's great.
2,"Wan, slight collection of prosaic poems","The very thin collection of poems by University of Toronto professor of English and gay and AIDS activist Michael Lynch (who died of AIDS in 1992) has a few flashes of wit, but neither searing images or memorable lines. Indeed, the lines don't scan very well and wobble across stanza breaks in a number of instances. The final one, no less prosaic than the other multi-part riffs, ""Yellow Kitchen Gloves,"" jottings on a demonstration in Washington, D. C. after police there wore gloves for another AIDS-related demonstration, seems to me the most interesting, but the wan poetry is eclipsed by the slightly mysterious graphics of Douglas Kinsey.Lynch's biography, _AIDS Activist._ by Ann Silversides, is more interesting than his poetry."
3,Not bad,"Iron Man has not been one of my favorite Marvel characters, but it was interesting to see more of his early appearances. With the short stories as they appeared in Tales of Suspense, character development is limited, and there is a lot of repetition from story to story (""If only they knew their indifferent boss is really Iron Man!"" ""If only I could tell Pepper how I really feel about her!"" ""If I can't get my chestplate plugged in, my heart will fail!""). I have a feeling when the stories get full-length, they'll be better. It will be interesting to see how they re-develop his origin in the upcoming live-action movie."
3,not in colour,"It came quickly, but I didn't realize it was going to be in black and white- so I'm a little disappointed that it's not in colour."
2,"Essential Iron Man, Volume 1","This comicbook story is good. The stories in the Iron Man Volume 1 (Marvel Essentials) appeals to children and adults. The artwork in Essential Iron Man, Volume 1 (Marvel Essentials) is excellent. I RECCOMMEND Essential Iron Man, Volume 1 (Marvel Essentials) to children and adults."
3,If you expect Jesper to teach you how to swing.... Sorry,"This tape describe the training (physical) programs in order to strengthen the swing. Well, it depends on your expectation. If you really expect to train up your muscles to prepare for powerful swing, this tape should suit you. At least this tape is much better than Gerry James's ""Advanced Power Golf"". Each session is focus on different phase of swing: takeaway, backswing, impact etc. and the trainer would explain in details why you need this exercise for that particular phase of swing."
4,Fun!,"I'd never seen the poem before, so this was a first for me. The pictures are beautiful, and go along very well with the words...they are creative and up-to-date. Ex. For toasted pig, the captain eats a toasted hot dog, and for figs, fig newtons. I read the book to my 3rd grade students. They especially liked that the kids were playing the parts that would normally go to grown-ups. As one said about the book,""That's cool""! A good book to use when talking about the difference between real and make-believe, also a good jumping point to writing fantasy stories or poems."
2,"Disappointing. Cute, but the story and pix don't match well.","This presentation of the classic nonsense poem is not as good as pervious publications of it as a song. Previously, the song carried a fun tune, and the illustrations actually followed the story well. In this version, the illustrations follow the story in only the vaguest way. Using children as the crew, and the use of vibrant colors, would have worked well had the illustrations actually matched the text.Sometimes newer approaches are just not better."
4,GREAT Multiplayer Action,"Dodge ball may not be as fun in real life as this game. You might remember Super Dodge BAll for the original Nintendo, which was a great multiplayer game back then. Well, it still is a great 2 player game for GBA, as Atlus relases and updates it with style. Immediately after you start playing, the fun level will be obvious. This game is fast and wild. You can smack your enemies in the jaw in many different ways. Using combos, you have throws like the Snake Shot, Sidewinder, Multishot, or Pause Shot. If you like to manage your players, then you can with options and player stats you can chance, like formation, toughness, and agility. Colorful graphics, lively music, and good controls make this game pretty good, especially for two players. If you want a crazy multiplayer game, then you've got it here."
4,"First, disregard that review above","Maybe this guy hasn't played the game yet, but it's good. You catch the ball, and press A to throw...it's the same concept as Super Dogeball for the NES back in the day and if you are an old school gamer whatsoever, then most of you will remember this game as being incredibly fun. How can you go wrong with a sequel with better graphics and the same type of gameplay? I don't think you can. Oh and same programmerse too, just under Atlus instead of Technos Japan."
2,Super Dodge ball advance:not very good,"either buy the game used or if you have about 100 friends with the game. otherwise it is pointless because it takes about a half an hour to beat, literally. after that you can just use exhibition mode and play which gets pretty boring.overall:replay value: 3/5control: 2/5, the menus are easy to navigate but super throws just happen and there is no way to pick which one you will usesound5/5: the tunes are catchy and aren't boringgraphics:3/5, the only graphics are the little people who can be determined by the color of their hairmultiplayer:3/5, the teams are almost all the same and the difference in their stats doesn't make a difference so once you play someone once the next time it is boring."
5,Awesome,"this game rocks, there is so much you can do with it. I was looking for a really addictive game and this is it. It is very very good."
3,Not Bad....,"This game is fun to play, but you run out of things to do real fast. The best way to keep it from getting boring is to link it and play with your friends. The problem with that is that they still need their own copy of the game because it doesn't use the GBA ability to use just one copy of the game. It is still an entertaining game for when you have nothing else to do and it is plenty of fun for classic gamers. All in all, it's a fun game , but runs low on fun after a few times of playing."
4,A fun fast ball frenzy!!!!!!!!!,"Bought it, played it, beat it... when I first played this game I beat tournament without losing once...then I realized you can raise the difficulty level, and then it became fun lots of different types of super throws. This game is a great improvement from the NES version, if you've played the original you know what I'm talking about. Just a fun game only not many modes of play. This got a 4 because it didn't included Bean Ball mode that was in the original, bean ball mode is where you pick a character a go in a fun free for all arena with a friend and computers, otherwise a MUST BUY!!!"
3,"Fun at first, gets old","This Game has a lot of the same characteristics of the original for the Super NES, which will make older gamers happy. But the game play doesn't change enough for my taste. Even the indroduction of new, more powerful teams didn't peak my excitement. In my view, it's worth renting, but because a good gamer could beat it in a half hour, it's not worth buying."
4,It's good but not great,"When I first got this I thought that it was a lot of fun, and I still do, but the main point is it starts to get boing after 10 minutes of playing sometimes."
5,sweet!,"If your looking for a game to begin with on gameboy advance this is the on! there are 13 teams from all over the world and they compete for the championship.there is one player, who is the best, on each team that is the leader of the team. you can choose between 50 different throws to knock down your opponent, some wich are really fast and some that pause in midair. if you think all the game is based on is catching and throwing your wrong! the dodgeball advance has gamplay that will satisfy you for hours and hours of fun! make super dodgeball advanced yours!!!!!"
4,"Good, But overated.",Very fun to play. But after a while it gets boring. It is too easy they should either make it longer or harder!
3,"Good game, lousy ending.","Dodgeball is lots of fun to bring on plane rides, in cars and sometimes on vacations but is definintely not the best game in the world. The Championship mode and special mode are really easy to beat and are only somewhat time consuming and you don't see anything good or get anything good except for the dream teams (which really aren't that much better than the normal teams) This is definintely not my favorite game."
2,Overglorified Pong.,"That's all this game is. Throw the ball, catch the ball, throw the ball again... The only redeeming factor is the super throws, but they aren't worth the price of admission."
2,No Depth!,"This game is fun for awhile. In fact for the first night I had it I couldn't put it down. Then I have beaten the game enough times to unlock every hidden team it became exteremely boring. Once the good graphics and fun super throws wear off then u kinda get bored with it. Once u have mastered the techniques (jumps, dash throws, etc.) the game becomes so boring that I just played Suer Mario and F-Zero (both very good games)."
5,An Immigrant's Love of America,"There are so many wonderful stories of immigrants who struggled and overcame poverty to achieve greatness in some field. Irving Berlin's life experience is eloquently captured in this excellent biography. The Russian Jewish boy who left his impoverished Lower East Side New York family to avoid being a burden and became one of the greatest American composers of popular songs, songs like ""Alexander's Ragtime Band,"" ""Easter Parade,"" ""White Christmas,"" and ""God Bless America,"" is the subject of a most inspiring story....There is only one minor correction I would make: the box of the A&E DVD says the running time is ""approx. 100 mins.,"" when in fact the program runs about 87 minutes."
4,For the record...,"I agree, Irving Berlin was a brilliant songwriter, and A&E always does a nice job with their biographies. But he didn't write ""Yankee Doodle Dandy,"" as is written in another review- that was George M Cohan. For a wonderul portrayal of George M, get the movie ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" starring Jimmy Cagney- and you thought he just did gangster movies..."
5,Where's The Hollywood Biopic?,"Irving Berlin is generally recognised as America's greatest ever songwriter and this superb documentary interviews family and friends as well as having a generous helping of excerpts from film and stage productions. No doubt ir has been shown on the box but anyone who wishes to know more on the life and times of this extraordinary man and musician shouldn't hesitate.It seems strange that while we have some interesting Hollywood biopics on many of the great 20th century Broadway writers as far as I can ascertain nothing has been made on Irving Berlin, although he does appear as a link character in several of such films. In the meantime this is about as good as it gets."
3,very academic minded,"This book was not what I expected. It is not a light-hearted read. It is very deep, heavy on geology, natural history, and philosophy. The author has a very collegial voice and has a vocabulary to go along with it. I am college educated, but I ran across many words and technical terms having nothing to do with fishing whose meaning I was uncertain. The parts of the book that described fishing experiences were enjoyable, otherwise there was a great deal of information I could not relate to. It's not a bad book, and I am glad to have read it, but it just wasn't what I was expecting."
2,"Slow, deep, not a fish story book","The book is a slow read, very literate and at times monotonous. This book isn't really about trout or flyfishing, but more about the author's philosophical view of the environment surrounding the driftless area. This book reads like it was written by a philosophy professor instead of a fisherman. This book was not what I was expecting."
2,Jerusalem Creek,Sure could tell English professor wrote it. Was way too fluffy. Lots of slow places. Not enough description of the fishing experience.
2,This is NOT Mozart's Entführung aus dem Serail!,"This was a very disappointing performance, and I question why it was chosen for a DVD. The singing is acceptable, but not what I would consider to be especially inspired. The root of the problem is the production. I was so looking forward to adding this DVD to my collection, as this ranks as one of my favorite operas--thank goodness I checked it out at the library first! It just is not a captivating performance, and it is far too untraditional for my taste. Surely a much better version of this opera will come along on DVD. Until then, you're better off enjoying it on CD and leave the visuals to your mind. It is doubtful your imagination will conjure up anything like this production of annoying mirror images! It is disturbing to say the least and it does nothing to enhance our understanding of Mozart or this opera."
1,Annoying - Bad Singing,"To see all the characters played by TWO people is truly annoying. For example, there are always two constanzes on stage, two blonchens, and two everyone...The singing is average, the stage is modern...it does not reflect traditional mozart style."
4,Simple,I was looking for a chisel set...this is a chisel set...they are sturdy and the plastic cover helps with the grip.Overall not bad for the price.
2,Boring DVD!,"We have the spiral-bound workbook, and my son actually loves the stories, and they have helped him remember multiplication facts. I thought the DVD would help to reinforce the stories by animating them, but no. It's just a voice reading (verrry slowwwly) the tales from the workbook as the drawings appear on the screen. The slowwww voice is maddening to both of us! Then come the quizzes. A DVD of quizzes, whee. I wish I hadn't spend the extra money on the DVD. The workbook alone is plenty."
5,Little kings and princesses will love it!,"What youngster hasn't dreamed of being a king or a princess? All children love to hear tales of the royal kindom, of competition and love. This one contains the elements and virtues of perseverance and wisdom. A fun story that has a valuable lesson too."
4,"Understandable, approachable NT Commentary","Of the modern commentaries of the New Testament, this may be one of the most easy to grasp. The writing style is friendly, and it doesn't bog the reader down scholarly analysis of every other word. As is the case with many Bible commentaries, I wish the typeface were a bit larger.If you are a Bible Study teacher and would like one reference book on the NT, Raymond E. Brown's may be the most scholarly, but Barton's book is more friendly and, ultimately, more useful from the standpoint of your students."
5,Jesusdyd4u,"This is by far the best commentary I've viewed. It provides history, purpose and life application for each book. A must have for any novice or serious bible reader."
4,Great study Guide,This was very helpful as we study the new testament. Lots of info and very easy to use as a study guide.
1,I Think There's a Terrorist in My Soup,"Customers considering buying this book need to know that it should carry an ""R"" rating. Funny, yes, but definitely not for a ""G"" rated mind. Wish I had been warned."
1,Avoid!,"to get a good quality, single-disc collection of the original recordings of some of Merle Haggard's greatest music, ""20 Greatest Hits"" on the Capitol/EMI label is good, as is the budget cd ""Best of the Best"" also on Capitol (avoid similarly titled releases on different labels)...to really do Merle Haggard's legacy justice, easily the best single purchase currently available is the multi-label box set compilation called ""Down Every Road"""
5,THIS IS A TRUE TO LIFE THRILLER,MYSELF BEING A TRUE CRIME FAN I MUST SAY THIS IS TRUE CRIME AT IT'S BEST AND READING THIS BOOK IS ALMOST LIKE YOU WERE THERE. THIS IS A HORRIFIC BOOK TO READ IT IS VERY CHILLING. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT READ HORROR NOVELS THAT CLAIM TO BE HORRIFING BUT THAT IS ALL FICTION. THIS IS TRUE TO LIFE WHICH MAKES IT EVEN MORE HORRIFING. THE OTHER GOOD THING ABOUT THIS BOOK FROM A READERS STAND POINT IS THAT IT LEAVES A LOT TO SPECULATE ABOUT WHICH IS ALSO THE BAD THING BECAUSE IN REAL LIFE THIS MONSTEROUS KILLER COULD STILL BE AT LARGE AND TAKING THE LIVES OF YOUNG MISLED WOMEN.
3,Chilling story,I thought this was a very good book for the most part but bogged down like others mentioned with police politics. I found myself skipping paragraph's and even pages at times just skimming to get back to the detective work.
4,Good overview of the GRK case,"Overall, I thought this was a good overview of the Green River killer case. I had not paid much attention to it, but when Ridgway was caught and sentenced in Nov, 2003, it really got my attention. The book by Smith and Guillen portrays the police who chased the killer for so many years, and also explains some of the mistakes they made, partly because they had never had to deal with a situation of this magnitude before. It is a very interesting book. However, I did find lots of typos in the copy I had, which was paperback. The person who checked for errors did not do a good job. No book should be released with typos in it today. Some of the victims' names were misspelled. For instance, Shawnda Leea Summers' first name was spelled Shawanda. These are mistakes that should not have been made. According to Dave Reichert's new book it was Shawnda."
1,Not good writing or pacing,"This book meandered for hundreds of pages, dwelling on minute details and long-winded memories. I cannot recommend this book. These people actually made serial murder boring. And that is almost unforgivable. Go buy something interesting instead."
3,Inaccurate...at least in describing my Family,"There is only one page that is in the book that is supposed to describe my family's reaction to the news.Almost every ""fact"" that is quoted is wrong,so how am I supposed to believe the rest of the book? I have seen people discuss things about me in chat rooms,using this book as fact,as if they were there. They will tell me it's true because it's in this book! I guess to some people..even if it's straight out wrong or a mistake ,it's gospel ,if it's in print. As for Mr. Mike super reviewer ...yes,it's been Twenty years and no, most of the Women were not as ""high class"" as you believe yourself to be..but,There are quite a few people who find what happened to my sister (Opal) and the others in fact Horrifying. There it is..misspelled words,improper sentence structure and all..which often happens from writing from the heart."
4,great reference,"this book was also purchased in conjunction with ""issues explored through the green river murders."" the two books together provided a very comprehensive picture of what happened. this book is long and a tedious read sometimes, however it is a fantastic reference as to the chronological timeline of events that occurred during the investigation."
4,Great movie - Comedy Romance a great combination,This is a great movie. Not all funny not all perfect but a girly romantic comedy. Derbez is known for his sense of humor but you wont find his best here. His character is not the typical clown he usually plays. All in all a not too bad movie.
1,total garbage,This does not work. It shows a different temperature each time I use it and it's off as much as a degree each time. I follow all instructions and this shows my temperature changes as much as a degree when I take it immediately one time after another. Not worth the cost of shipping back.
4,Great product. Very glad I bought it,"I am recovering from a c-section. This is a great product. I can easily bring the baby in to my arms. I'm really glad I purchased this.I also like the storage area underneath and the pockets on the side. Very handy.I would have given it 5 stars if the instructions were a little more clear on assembly. There are places that say ""press here"" and it doesn't really do anything when you ""press here""."
4,Does the job,Aside from knowing what a robin and sparrow are I have no clue about birds. I bought this book hoping to identify some of the birds at my feeder and a huge bird that is not a hawk that is sitting in my pine tree. It has been serving its purpose. The pictures are acurate and the description tells me that the birds do live in my area. If you are an expert or are looking for an extensive book on birds this probably will not be enough for you but for the beginner this does the job.
2,No good for a backyard birdwatcher,"I bought this book just so that I could identify some of the birds at my backyard birdfeeder. So far, I've only been able to identify one from this book. The pictures and descriptions aren't very good, and it's very hard to narrow down the type of bird, since they're not organized by geographic area, etc. I would definitely recommend the National Audobon Society books over this one."
3,Good Book for Beginners,"Really wasn't what I was looking for as a serious birder, but it's a nice little starter for those who don't have the basics in their head yet. I plan on passing it on to my niece who's just developing an interest. Great illustration and beginner knowledge; really helps you with the most common birds available. Not for advanced birders. The price is right for what you get."
2,Disappointing,"Yes, I know this book is for absolute beginners, and the pictures and descriptions of the birds are adequate. What is missing are the latin names of the species, and even a beginner or a child should get used early to use them, as they are the international standart."
2,size,I was disappointed with this purchase as I thought I was purchasing a full size book. the info is too limited as well
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting a magazine that discussed different options and ideas for new businesses, including franchises. I thought this was geared to the small business owner. All it has are profiles of people who have started a business and are now millionaires. Not much else in the magazine."
1,Free and worth less than what I paid.,"I've read this for 6 months, although reading is an overstatement. This is a magazine you can flip through in about 10 minutes. It's 90% ads, 10% articles (most of which appear to be ads). They continually talk about all the newest tech, very little of which relates to business. The cost analysis of gadgets is bad. Very bad."
1,"If you want to waste your time with useless information, this is the magazine!","The only good thing about this magazine is its title 'Entrepreneur'. It is an enticing title and sounds promising to new and aspiring entrepreneurs. But once you've read a couple of issues you know it's place is in the trash bin. The internet is a treasure house of informative and inspirational stuff, this magazine is like an ad book with useless or redundant information.It's an utterly disappointing magazine for what it claims."
1,This magazine used to be good,I was a subscriber to this magazine about 10 years ago. I recently subscribed again. After receiving my first issue I remembered why I cancelled it. 75% of it is advertisements. I can only take so many janitor franchises.
1,Need advice on choosing the right attache case?,"Uhg. Can you imagine taking a college class at Berkeley on how to operate a cement mixer or chainsaw? That's kind of how this magazine feels. A lot of non-Entrepreneurs in a little publishing outfit trying to tell you about all these ""trendy"" things. Which cell phones are hot? How much should you spend on a haircut? Come on, let's get real. This magazine is a joke."
3,"Okay, but there are better","I wrestled between 2 and 3 stars. In the end, when I flip through Entrepreneur I'm usually disappointed. Inevitably there will be some helpful info but there are other magazines that offer much more in content and layout that are in the same price range (ex: Inc, Fast Company, maybe Wired)."
1,I Prefer Just Paying Once,"I enjoy the magazine good enough, I do. What I DON'T appreciate is that even if you have bought a subscription they make you pay if you want to access it via a mobile app. Seriously?! Why on earth should I have to pay for it a second time?! I guess that's one lesson learned on starting a business, nickel and dime your current customers til they leave. Well done."
2,Misnamed,"What this magazine should be named is ""Franchises"". Entrpreneurs are risk takers, people who invest in franchises are risk-avoiders, and often end up being cheated. Of course there's no mention of that in this magazine; it might offend the advertisers."
2,SLOW.....,"It took a very long time for the 1st issue to come. I think I received 1st issue roughly 3 months after placing order on Amazon. I then moved and promptly updated change of address info. That was a least 3 months since i received the 1st issue. I have still yet to receive 1st issue at new address!!! Very poor service. Magazine itself is decent, but will probably just stick with Inc. & Fast Company after this subscription runs out."
2,I have to wait 2 months to receive my first issue?,Entrepreneur magazine is a great magazine. Why do I have to wait two months get my first issue? I made my order on 9/01/08 and I have to wait until 11/17/08.
3,Late delivery,I have read this magazine else where and it seemed to be fantastic. But I have subscribed to it since long now and have not been delivered a single copy as yet.
2,Great if you love looking at advertisements,"Well over half the magazine is advertisements, very few articles from which i've learned nothing at all. I would recommend taking a look at their website (entrepreneur.com) instead of subscribing to their magazine. Their website contains better articles that can be more helpful than those found in the magazine."
3,Clymer BSA Manual,"This manual is a good start when working on one of these older bikes. However it covers many different brands and models, and diagrams and instructions are very vague. If you are working on multiple bikes it may be good, or if you are not sure what year your bike is it is useful. However, if you know exactly what model and year you own you will be better off finding an original factory repair manual (and parts manual), they are all over E-Bay."
3,"More Wendell, Please","An interesting story, well told both from the perspective of history and through the eyes of the author as a nine year old West Virginia boy. But where's Wendell?We get the political maneuvering and the fascinating ""We want Wilkie' convention gallery, but the candidate himself seems missing, underwritten. We want to feel his presence and we don't. Wilkie is the ghost behind the page. Wish he jumped off it."
2,Stranger than fiction,I just made this using water and oil. Texture is exactly like bread but tastes a little like soap and is really weird and white. Would not recommend this at all.
3,A decent gluten free bread this is easy to make,"This bread rises well and very little effort goes into preparing this bread. However, it did not get a great review because it is mostly unhealthy starch in the bread and the color is very white. It is the whitest bread I have ever seen."
3,"OK, but ...","I may revisit this review after I have a chance to try recipe variants. I find other Orgran products wonderful. This bread mix was a total failure in the bread machine I have (Regal Kitchen Pro). It fluffed up as advertised when cooked in the oven but you MUST follow the instructions to the letter or the loaf can come apart. It still tastes like rice flour bread to me. Compared to the bricks of GF bread I can buy at my local health food store, this bread is very very good. Compared to what I remember about good Italian or Pep Farm bread, it's pedestrian. In fairness, Orgran Buckwheat Pancake mix (see my review there) has many great variants, so if I find one for this bread mix I'll post that. (I'm a 60yo celiac.)"
1,Another bunch of remakes,"Later in his career Charley Pride did a massive recording session where he re-recorded all his biggest hits.At the time it was well intentioned because almost all of the original versions of these songs were unavailable.But be forewarned, the songs on this disc are all remakes."
4,Very capable,"I've had one of these for three years, and am just now ready to replace it. While all the leather PDA cases look nicer, the CHUS01 has a feature that I find indisposable: a hook-and-loop closing belt loop. This is much more secure than a belt clip, and will make it much less likely for you to lose your PDA."
1,Same as cleaning your tongue with regular toothpaste,See my review for the Tung brush that goes with this gel. I don't prefer this system at all. Makes me gag something awful.
3,decent product,"ships soon, it worked like a charm for first few days. I could feel the freshness, my taste buds changed.after a few days it didnt seem to make much difference."
2,sore throat a coincidence maybe?,"I used this and shortly after had a horribly painful sore throat...stopped using it and forgot about it....used it again sometime after and got a horribly sore throat again the next day! It may just be a weird coincidence but I'm actually afraid to start using it again even though I want to, it did make my tongue pink and moist though. Has anyone else had the same experience?"
5,Great stuff,This is a great product! Works very well. But only use it once a day because it can be very drying and cause sores if used more than once a day.
5,Best one on Amazon market,"I was looking for tongue (foam/gel/etc) cleaning solutions for a while, so I bought everything I found at the moment on Amazon.It's sad that you cannot get any tongue cleaning solution in local pharmacies. Thank you Amazon!This gel is the most effective one."
4,WORKS FINE,THIS GEL IS GREAT IT DEF SEAKS THE PLAQUE FROM THE TONGUE AND WHEN I SCRAPE I SEE WHITE STUFF MOVING WHICH IS DISGUSTING BUT THATS HOW YOU KNOW THAT ITS WORKING.LOVE IT AND PLAN ON REORDERING REAL SOON.
2,Not Tasty :(,"The product arrived quickly with no problems in the packaging. The snack it's self has the texture of pork rinds and has a disgusting aftertaste (not to mention the terrible texture) i've got celiac and keep trying to find a new snack for my commute to/from work. These were not what I was hoping they'd be. my roommate also didn't like them, my dog won't even eat them :( terribly disapointing."
1,DIABETICS: take a look at the label!,"The chips by themselves are edible, but mediocre. What really hacks me is the fact that all the calorie and nutrition info is based on ""serving size"". The little bag contains 1.5 servings. That is true ""word-magic"" rip-off. Such distortion may be legal but it completely skews the information for those of us on low-carb diets. Shame on Kay's! I will never buy anything from this company again, and urge you to do the same."
1,If you Like Cardboard,"I thought these would be a good hi-protein snack to have on hand. They're gritty & taste like cardboard. There's an occasional hard piece in them that make one worry about breaking a tooth. My children dislike them as well, my son said he thought he was going to throw up after eating one..."
2,Kuncheeze are squeezed,I ordered these based on the positive reviews on amazon as well as I had been satisfied by other products by Kay's naturals. I found the cheddar cheese taste to be ok but the problem was that over 50% of the crackers in the bag have been crunched and it makes it difficult to eat. I canceled my subscription to the crackers. The box arrived intact and well packaged but the inside items were still crushed.
1,Product is barely edible & packages do not include the amount advertised.,"The quantity information on this product is inaccurate. The ad says each bag is 1.5 ounces, (even 1.75 ounces per bag, if you read further on the description), but it has actually been downsized to 1.2 ounces.For the case of 12 that I bought I received a full 3.6 ounces less than was advertised. Customers have a right to know how much product they are getting when they order. Although I have informed them of this error they still have not changed the promotion to read the correct 1.2oz. Buyer beware.Edit: I didn't realize while I was complaining about the downsizing that they also changed the formula. The product is less crunchy, almost stale, and far more crumbly than before. I am removing my subscription to this product."
1,Terrible!,Very unhappy with purchase. These taste awful. Remind me of the cheap boxed salad crutons that used to be popular in the 1980s. Even though they are gluten free they remind me of dried out bread. And the flavor is not similar to white cheddar (not sure what it is). I have purchased other Kay's products (lemon herb chips are great!). [...]
1,Not worth it.,"From their online information, these snacks looked so nutritious that they were almost too good to be true. However, I ended up only eating half of one bag, and throwing the rest away. I thought they tasted disgusting."
4,Good - but please note the size of the bag!,"I enjoy these snacks but I hope buyers note that this bag is NOT an individual serving. Depending on the item, the bags are usually 1.5 to 1.75 ounce when the single serving is 1 ounce. So that 130 calories is NOT for the entire bag. If you eat the entire 1.5 ounce bag it just shy of 200 calories. That's a significant difference for me. I still enjoy Kay's Naturals but I wish they would bag them differently to make it easier to eat the correct amount."
2,Wish it was cheesier....,I am going to drop it into soup. Not very tasty on it's own. It's a texture and flavour thing.
1,"Please Google search for ""ViRobot unstall"" before purchase!","Be extremely careful!!!I have downloaded Hauri's ViRobot 5.5 a long time ago.About 2 years ago, I switched to a different anti-virus ware since my company bought the site license, I had to remove the ViRobot. I still can't remove this darn thing that takes up about 70 MB of my disk. The company staff gave me an incorrect information on the removal.Now lots of complaints are in the net since it has been extremely difficult to remove the software."
1,"Good software, bad company","The software works very well, but dealing with the company can be a nightmare."
3,"Radical Vision, Utopian Prospective","Jameson's groundbreaking literary criticism and sociological analysis underscore the release of the sublimated repressed desires in realist representation (realism) and orientates itself toward a relax of political unconscious.It mediates the symbolic narrative and its mirrored ideological interpellations. As a Marxist, he foresees the fuse of the super/infrastructure and a utopian sense of humanism that isolates from alienation and reification."
2,Not About Dreams!,"This book is not about dreams, so if you want to know about dreams, you should get ""The Dream Book"" instead. I don't understand this book."
2,does not compare to rampart,"This game gets lost in what it wants to be. Strategy or Puzzler? Sadly, it does not do either well. Fortress becomes dull very quick. The different ""stages"" are cosmetic and provide no real game play value. It is over way to fast. Rent it first but I do not see this game high on many people's lists. My standards for a pocket game are pretty low. All I expect is something to kill time on a trip or just sitting around. Fortress feels like forced labor in which you never get anything done."
2,CAUTION This is ONLY for certain models!,"I bought this with high hopes as online stores were expensive for similar models, and none of them had a 9v option. I should say this.. it did NOT work on my Nokia 3650 or 3595, The box says it will only work with Nokia models. 3200, 3300, 8200, 8800 and I also tested on a 5100 series and that worked.. However those arent the phones I need it for.. I want it for my 3650. =(Its not the product that is bad, or the idea.. it is Amazons for not properly marking that this will not work on any other model besides whats listed! Aside from that, I could see many good uses in this product!"
5,Get it!,Everything you've ever wanted to about Snowy and his career. Rare live and in studio clips are included. Well worth it.
2,Scratches easily,"This is an elegant looking cheese board, hence why I ordered it.But I wouldn't reccommend it for these two reasons:the knife that comes with it easily scratches the marble. This happened both times I've used the cheese board.it has threet small ""legs"" on the bottom that when you try cutting cheese don't balance well. The board has tipped over a few times when guests have tried cutting a piece of cheese.I've gone back to using my older/sturdier wooden cheese board.This may work well if you already cut up the cheese and use it that way?"
5,"wonderfully written,a rare piece of excellent literature","i found this book carelessly deposited in a dump.it was dated by it's owner ""1892""..i salavaged it because i love old books..i found a rare piece of excellent literature..the writing style should be taught in english classes in every high school in america..the storyline is saturated with twists, turns and suspense but ultimatly deals with human nature and the consequences of human behavoir..we should be hammering the publisher to reprint it so no one else has to rummage through a dump to have their mind enlarged."
3,A collection of great writers not at their best.,"Cutting Edge wants to be an anthology on the level of Kirby McCauley's landmark contemporary dark fantasy collection Dark Forces. Sadly the collection falls short of that noble mark, mainly due to stories that are a far cry from the contributing writers best work. Only Robert Bloch's personal feeling short story 'Reaper' is a real stand out."
3,"Nice, although required a few mods","This thing looks pretty nice in my truck. I cannot say much about the initial operation of the unit (i.e. brightness, battery life, or using the switch.) I ordered this knowing that I was going to mod it to hard wire into an onboard 5V output. For me it is very bright and kicks on when I start my truck.The only issue that I had with this unit is that it did not fit my gear shift. I had to purchased a specific drill bit that cost me more than the shifter so that I could get it to fit. So if you purchase this for a Ford Ranger, be prepared with a 9/16"" drill."
4,Good Resource,"An excellent resource in discovering many of the Italian stories that served as inspiration for Shakepeare's Measure for Measure, and other plays."
2,Not so good...,"It is solid and has a nice glow, but...the plastic started cracking within two days. The screws would loosen and constantly need to be re-tightened. Long story short, I took it out and I'm $30.00+ poorer."
3,"Looks Nice, Broken Clock is a bummer.","I really wanted a 14 or more cup drip maker, and this is the only non-professional, inexpensive one that I could find on the Net. There are many 10-12 cup devices, but my small office kept draining the 12 cups before I could get mine!I am pleased with the volume and the heat, but the clock runs fast. It prevents us from using the timer to program the next morning's brew. Yes, I should have returned it, but I had thrown out the box already. Here's your lesson for the day. Keep the box!"
1,Please save your money,Never hated a product enough to write a review. We've had ours less than six months and it stopped working for no apparent reason. It's hard to see the display and extremely hard to set the time. Will not buy any machine from this company again.
1,Terrible product-get something else,"The first one I received did not work, lights came on, but no brewing. They sent a second which worked fine for one week, then suddenly stopped brewing. I expected better from this coffee maker."
2,Nice looking but doesn't last long,"It is very durable looking unit but ours lasted only about a year. It was nice for that year but expect my coffee maker to last longer, seems to be a common complaint on this unit from what I see. Wouldn't buy DeLonghi again even though it has a neat Italian name."
2,HISTORY CRIME BUFF,Marie Barrow the youngest of the Barrow children decided to tell her story regarding Bonnie And Clyde and brother Buck Barrow but unfortunately she died within 60 days of meeting her co-writer at the age of 81. The result was mainly rehashed stories that I had read in other publications. Not enough of her personal story was included which I attribute to her untimely death. To bad the book did not go real deep into Marie and her families personal perspective. I feel the co-writer felt he had to complete the book with recycled stories
1,Nothing new here.,"Why Marie Barrow thought the world needed yet another book about Bonnie and Clyde is a mystery in itself. Basically, it's 146 pages of a little sister's adulation for her big brother. The tone of the book has Marie almost reveling in her sicko sibling's accomplishments, i.e., death and destruction, and she [Marie] never seems to be without an excuse for every demonic deed. Meshed in here and there are various family photos of both the Barrows and the Parkers, turning it into a bit of a psychotic family album. I have only three words for anyone thinking of buying this book......save your money!"
3,The family side of the story,"The family story of Bonnie and Clyde was an ok read, but I have to admit I was a little disappointed. I would not recommend this book to someone who is just starting to learn about Bonnie and Clyde. The Lives and Times of Bonnie and Clyde by ER Miller and My Life with Bonnie and Clyde by Blanche Barrow are much better books to start with. It is not that this is a bad book, it is just that much of the information is general information and the bibliography is much shorter than the other books. There is some added information by family members but not very much. I do want to salute Marie Barrow Scoma and Phillip Steele for the writing of this book, they shed a little more light on the events of Bonnie and Clyde."
2,A disappointment,"The author makes much hype about how good he is with history and the fact he wrote this with Clyde's youngest sister,Marie,that is until she died before the book was finished.Years ago I read the book that is accredited to Clyde's other sister:Nell and to Bonnie's mother.I say ""accredited"" since its publication its authorship has been challenged,but its still often quoted by writers and historically holds up well.So I read this book with great eagerness and was very disappointed,a lot of ""facts"" are plain wrong,a simple check with vital stastics,or cementery records could have corrected them, even a mislabeled picture or two,We know Marie was ill but could the author not checked facts-or did he make the mistakes after she died??There are no pics that I have not been seen elsewhere-except of the author in Marie's home with her son.If someone has a copy-its worth a read-but don't waste your money buying a copy."
2,copper adjustable magnetic ring for arthiritis,"It was worth the chance that it might help, but it did not. When my hand gets really bad, I just take 2 cvs arthiritis pills which lessen the pain but make me tired."
4,el naturalista boots,"I love the look, quality is good, but I gave it 4 stars because they run very small. I recomend ordering size up."
2,What this book really covers,"All this book consists of is one practice test and the topics outline that the ETS normally sends you when you register for the biochem. subject test. If you want only one practice test for $7, it's just fine. But if you're looking for a more review-oriented book, look elsewhere."
1,Don't bother,"I bought this book thinking it was a review similar to those for the General GRE exam, I thought wrong. This book is a bound version of a sample test that you can download from the ETS website along with the ""helpful"" hints that the ETS provides. Don't bother wasting your time and money trying to get a copy of this book, you can download the whole thing as a PDF at the ETS website."
3,"Okay, but leaves desire for more...","Considering this is about the only attempt I'm aware of to document Tim Eyman's antics in my home state, very grateful. Would like to see an updated sequel.That said, I don't like how the DVD protrayed all non-elected opposition to Tim Eyman as either bullies, farces or spendthrifts. There is one state senator - Jacobsen - who I feel was protrayed sparingly but fairly. There is some intellectual opposition and genuine concerns about how Eyman's antics thru direct democracy are anywhere from incomplete (my view) to horrendous and a sequel showing how Eyman's initiatives have resulted in cutbacks wouldn't be so bad.Just like Tim Eyman, ""The Battles of Tim Eyman"" is noncomprehensive but enlightening as to a point-of-view. I would get the DVD just for the history alone."
2,An unremarkable tale of piracy and ghosts...,"I picked up this book because I enjoyed The Whipping Boy and like good stories about pirates...I thought this book would be a perfect match for me.I did enjoy the book, but it felt like it had no real content. The story is the traditional type. A bored young boy finds adventure on the high seas when he becomes unwillingly entangled with pirates. Sound familiar? I found myself constantly reminded of Treasure Island while reading this. If you're just looking for a pirate tale, you'll do better to pick that up.However, if you've finished Treasure Island, and absolutely loved it...if you're stomping around the house shouting ""Shiver me timbers!"" and ""Avast there, matey!"", then you'll find this book to be enjoyable enough. Just don't expect anything too memorable or thrilling. An acceptable light read. It should be noted, too, that the book may appeal more to middle school boys than it did to me. I certainly am not within its target audience."
3,Card driver and PVR is the key and takes mucho time,"I have this card and the software is dicey.I've used this card under W2k and XP and the particular operating system.Below is my expierence with installing the card to Windows XP.Certain versions of the PVR work well; certain versionsof the drivers suck. The best driver on my Asus P5QL/EPUMotherboard for Crossbar, Tuner and Capture driver versionwas 4.0.107.3210 [...] . It was different onanother Asus motherboard.As for PVR software: This software is a mish-mash of files.I don't recall what I installed, but it was some version ofthe 2006 version that worked best.So, experiment, or not.I'm I ""happy"" about this? Need you ask?With above drivers and program the card does what I need.Go to this address to find all the versions of drivers andPVR's for this card:[...]"
2,TV2000 & WinFast PVR Review,"User manual provides no default settings or explanations. Although every feature has a brief description, none tell you how to use the feature. PVR software loses track of audio and video can lock up. No explanation of bundled software. Technical support does not respond to e-mail.However, installation was fast and easy"
2,Leadtek WinFast TV2000 XP Expert,"The card was a little difficult to put in. Didn't seem to fit right. The RFtv and RFfm connectors seem to lay against the bottom of the external slot opening. The s-video works fine. I plugged in the playstation with the included connectors and it works great. The remote works great too. However only channels 26-31 come in and they have terrible reception. I've thought of trying to hook the cable through a vcr and then thru the s-video in the tv tuner card, but haven't had time to try. I have a relatively new computer, WIN XP. I may try installing the drivers again."
1,"Dumb book, not funny","I'm not sure what the purpose of this book was: It wasn't funny, it wasn't informative, it wasn't all that creative either. Plus it's a small book written in large font with wide spacing. You could read the whole thing in about 1 hour. If you're really curious, just go to your local bookstore and read it. Not worth the money!"
1,Not a serious financial book,I would stay away from this book if you want to learn anything of real value. There are some intersting facts but they are hidden.
3,"Funny, but not his best effort","I've read all of Dave's books and this one was funny, but not as consistenly ""roll-on-the-floor"" funny as many were. The chapters, helpfully, are divided between different themes or investment possibilities. Some are hysterical (especially the one about real estate investments), others less so. As usual, it's a quick read and ideal for a beach or airplane."
5,Dave Barry's funny take on high finance,"Another hilarious explanation of how things work, by Dave Barry. A virtually fact-free look at how the world of finance really works, Dave is amusing as usual. If you're a fan of Dave, you'll love this book. If you've never read Dave Barry before, you'll be a fan within the first few chapters."
3,Dave Barry past his prime,"A typical Dave Barry read... after reading it, you'll say to yourself, ""Yep, that was Dave Barry"". A funny book if you're usually rolling on the floor after reading his stuff, but not nearly as funny as Dave-in-his-prime writings such as Complete Guide to Guys. A must read for Dave Barry fans, if you're not a Dave Barry fan, then you can pass on it."
2,Kindle warning,"This book is hilarious, as Dave Barry's books usually are, but only the bits you can actually read. The Kindle edition has very bad reproductions of several of the diagrams, and basically all chapter 13 is illegible. I tried it on both Kindle for Windows and iPhone."
5,Cash in on the laughs!,"Call me effusive, but the astonishing Dave Barry is the most amusing writer alive. My daughter bought me this book, last weekend, then allowed me to read it only after she'd finished it. I thought Wendy Bagley's ""SCRAPS: Adventures in Scrapbooking"" was as funny as it gets until I started reading Barry's new book and was immediately reminded that nobody comes close to matching Barry's wit. Glad to have another volume to add to the shelf in our library devoted to Dave Barry's books."
2,OK read,"This book was a bit too sarcastic for me. I found myself getting excited at the possibility of learning new money secrets at the beginning of the first few chapters only to be let down with pages of endless ""humor"" instead of real constructive information. There were times when I thought the author would delve deeply into such subjects like Estate & Retirement Planning but he kept joking. There was some useful information on the history of the U.S. dollar, business startup & teaching your kids about money. Thank God, my copy was just a library book. I would recommend this book for comedy purposes but not for serious financial advice."
4,Funny as always,"I'm almost always amused by Dave Barry's books. Some of his humor is a bit juvenile but overall his books are generally worth the money. This one was no different and there were several laugh-out-loud sections, particularly when he discussed purchasing a car and his opinion of several cars, including the Aztek (the ""Buttmobile""). His vision of the corporate world was also hilarious to me as I was one of the many individuals who suffered when Coca-Cola decided to change its formula; I mean, what were they thinking??? The Suze Orman shtick got a bit old but overall this book was well worth my time."
4,Funny! (You Were Expecting an Economics Treatise?),"Another funny book by Dave Barry, this time tackling the sometimes not so funny topic of money. Barry begins by providing the reader with a quick ""Financial Health Assessment"" (five questions), moves on to ""How the U.S. Economy Works"" (includes a brief history of money), getting rich in the stock market, using real estate as an investment, etc., etc., and finally ending up with a chapter aptly titled ""Conclusion,"" complete with guarantee (though I'm not certain of what - it's not one of those ""money-back"" ones). In between are chapters with lots of advice on travel, cheating on taxes, arguing about money with your spouse, starting your own business, and providing for medical care (start by getting your own leeches).Funny, for certain, but best consumed in small doses so that the effect does not wear off."
5,Another Great Dave Barry Book,"Dave Barry is, perhaps, the premere comic writer around. Every book he has written is a gem. This one is no exception. This is another hilarious Dave Barry book. I laughed so hard at the section about Dave's son ""Fobert"" and the travelor's cheques that I got the hiccups. I highly recommend this book as a weekend read."
2,Is there something happening in there?,"It doesn't seem that Midway had the Gameboy Advance's screen in mind when they designed this game. The characters are far too small; some of their movements barely register. I felt more like I was simply twitching on the buttons and hoping something would happen. If you're a fighting game fan (as I am), you'll be better off waiting for the Street Fighter II port."
1,"Sorry, but I can't recommend R2R","Ready 2 Rumble - mini-review I tried it out for about 10 minutes at a store and that was more than enough. I was bored and went back to playing Iridion.- Mediocre graphics that don't make good use of the GBA's abilities. - Boring repetitive gameplay. - Static looking characters and background.Don't waste $... on this game - there are lots of others that will be a better investment. Believe me, if you spend $5 to rent this game for a night, you'll probably think even that was too much."
4,ready 2 rumble,"this game is pretty wicked awesome! if you want to play ready to rumble on a handheld, its here! just like the dreamcast version(well... almost)ratings all out of fivegraphics=4sound=4control=4overall=4this is a good game!"
2,"Great Graphics, but not too great a game","This game is not as fantasic as SF2. Controls are horrible, moves are difficult to execute and sluggish. A test of paitence and endurance for playing the game. Not a great game, but good graphics though. Only the championship mode is worth playing."
3,RUmble Review,"When I first picked up this game and started playing, i was like, "" Geez you gotta be kiddin, this game sucks !!!"" But after a while, it didnt seem that bad, the training, was fun, but the fights themselves were kinda dull, until i started to learn the combos, which made it more interesting. THen character selection could have been better, but ...anyway. THe graphics are not tha bad, there kinda cool, but the actual gameplay, slows the game down. Overall an average game."
2,Another failure in the family,As I said in the title this game is really bad for more intrested players. By saying that i mean that you'll hate this game if you like more challenging games and less simple games. If your a small kid like 6-9 years old then maybe you'll like this but definitly not if you are a more deepend player ( which in my opinion are the best players ever! ). So i reccomend not buying this game unless you really like simple stuff like this which is always just knock out the cpu!
1,WORSE GAME YOU COULD EVER PURCHASE.....,"The control response is bad. The graphics are horrible. There are no special moves. The boxers' punches don't seem real. The sound is low in quality. The overall concept of this game is inferior. Stay away from this game, do not waste your money, don't say you weren't warned."
2,Not the Greatest Solution for Home Networking,"Ok, I admit I'm a dummy when it comes to wireless networking. This book, overall was not very informative. Many times the step by step instructions provided were difficult to follow and didn't match up well with what was shown on my PC screen. There is a ton of ""fluff"" in this book, I wish they would just cut to the chase and provide clearer step-by-step instructions. This book really did not help me much."
5,Works well but hate the taste,"The foaming action of this toothpaste works well. I don't use it all the time because I don't care for the taste of it. However, brushing as they recommend about 2 minutes the foaming action works well to leave my teeth and mouth feeling clean long after I have finished brushing. The foaming action does work it foams after a few strokes but you still need to continue to brush normally.Overall I like this product the only draw back is the flavor is too much like listerine for my taste."
5,A toothpaste that really stands out,"It's not often I would go online to research a toothpaste after using it.. after all, it's just toothpaste.. but this is about the most unique toothpaste you will ever stumble across. The citrus taste is very unique and enjoyable, and the microfoaming effect is unlike anything you will see in other toothpastes.. this stuff finds it's way to the back of your throat to freshen all parts of your mouth effortlessly, and the effects last a long time. It really is an enjoyable brushing experience. Definitely worth a try."
2,Stains worse than most,"I use a new-fangled electric toothbrush (I'd tell you which kind, but they're not paying me for free advertising!). Well, as most of you electric brushers already know, the toothpaste kind of sprays out all over everything you're wearing. I have taken to brushing my teeth topless, because I can simply wipe my breasts off afterwards. What I have found with this Aquafresh Extreme Clean, it stains clothing more indelibly than my beloved Crest (oops, didn't mean to give 'em a plug, but I love their product). Plus the orange flavor makes me gag."
3,Overpriced,"Although the material presented is fairly interesting, the price of this DVD is much too high for the length (45 minutes total) of the disc. Something along the line of $9.00 would have been much more reasonable. Three separate ""hauntings"" are presented. Details of each are shown, followed by efforts to explain the causes. There are no extras....only the basic 45 minute program. Recommend that one wait until this comes to the nearest video rental store or, perhaps, acquire it via Netflix."
5,All Good Things...,"Years ago I saw a movie calledImpromptu, in it Judy Davis plays George Sand, the 19th Century French feminist novelist, in her pursuit of Chopin. This independent film highlights the difficult task of seducing Chopin that Sand took to with determination and quite a lot of comedy. I loved this film and immediately set out to read George's books only to find that they are of the worst sort of dribble that today is considered journalism by People Magazine. The appeal of her novels during her time was that they were essentially gossip rags that detailed the exploits of George and her famous friends, but literature they were not.This book however, tells the story of Chopin's death after he left George. Ravaged by tuberculosis and George, Chopin died with only George's daughter for company. Detailing the painful end that came to Chopin this book was both saddening and striking. This genius met his end aching and lonely. Eisler paints her picture so clearly you can't help but see it."
4,"Passionate, contemporary biography of Chopin","A richly textured and artfully compressed biography filled with family violence, political passions, dependencies and pride. Eisler has created a vivid portrait of the man who was blessed with musical genius and success -- and the love for the infamous woman novelist George Sand. Chopin was revered by contemporaries such as Schumann and Liszt, and after an early success dwindled away to a very unhappy demise.Not much new territory here, but Benita Eisler has made a contemporary biography that truly brings Chopin's life to light in a book that is both compelling and creative. A recommended read."
1,don't waste your money!!,"It has horribe graphics, worse weapons layouts, and the missions are the least bit interesting. if you want to waste your money, as i did, go ahead, but i think you can find a better, more THOUGHT OUT game."
4,Good Aircraft Game,"I believe F-14 Tomcat is a pretty good game. It shows one what a GameBoy Advance can really do...you can do so much (change weapon, deplloy flare/chaff, select target from NAV computer, etc.) with just like ten buttons. The colors and graphics are amazing.Here is a list of Pros and Cons of this game;Pros:1. Good graphics2. Multiple units in game (MIGs, battleships, oil rigs, Black Bird, etc.)Cons:1. Auto-Landing (I don't know about you, but I personally prefer to land by myself, the real thing)2. Not large playing environment.3. No multiple files (you have to remember the password for the level you've last completed to go where you were)4. No allies (only carrier which sinks relatively easily from enemy fire)Overall, though the Cons outweigh the Pros, I would recommend this game."
2,No Flying Start Here.,"I had great expectations for this game. I felt I had done my ""homework"", I read all the reviews did a little research on the developers, etc., but this was not enough. I was sort of expecting a game with similar characteristics as the NES ""Top Gun"", I may be going back a little too far for some of you gamers out there, but that was a great flying/shoot'em up game for those of you who can remember and I grew particularly fond of the carrier landing part after every mission (oh, the adrenalin!). Well, I am sorry to say that this game falls way short of delivering even a fifth of what that game delivered. While the graphics are fine, the actual game play is....well.... just not right, as for the carrier landing after the mission, they are a joke! I would recommend you look else where to spend you hard earn money . There are plenty of great GBA games out there (i.e. Mario Kart and Advanced Wars) that are worth every penny."
1,Off Topic,"Thankfully this book is not very long, so my disappointed is only so deep. It must be said that if Samuel Huntington did not write his ""Clash of Civilizations"", then this book would not have written or published. This is an attempt to argue Huntington's theory, which is fine, but in the wrong method.Entitled ""Identity and Violence"", Sen covers very little on Identity and even less on violence. Sen states that we all have multiple IDs. He then restates it. And then again. And then again with the added ideal that focusing on one ID is dangerous. He repeats this too many times.What Sen fails to address, recognize or grasp is the concept of an Identity. What is it? Why do we have them? What influences IDs? What are the connections between ID and violence. What is violence? Why is it used? Why is it bad? Is violence bad? Just way too many questions about Identity and Violence are left unanswered, unaddressed, and avoided in a book called ""Identity and Violence""."
2,Identity and Violence,"I felt this book was overly self aggrandizing in a way that academic writing often is. It takes the obvious, couches it in lofty rehtoric and tries to sell the ideas as original and pressing. They may be the latter, but are fairly self evident. I know this man is an intellectual who is well respected so it is surprising to me that in this book he kind of 'dumbs up' a set of premises that could be perhaps more influential were they 'dumbed down' for a different audience."
2,A repetitive story,"I like Sen's idea of focusing on more then one identity but that's about it. Every chapter is the same he just rewords it, I read the same thing over and over again. I am a second year college student and it was very hard to read at times. Didn't get more that my first sentence out of this book. If it wouldn't have been required reading I doubt that I ever would have bought it."
3,worked well,I got this for my 5yo. He was able to put it together himself once he saw how it went together. He hasn't played with it much though. I think if he had the service station also he would play with it more.
5,"Revolutionary Girl Utena, Vol. 1: To Till","Revolutionary Girl Utena, Vol. 1: To Till is the first volume in the Revolutionary Girl Utena series. This is classic manga style gender bending. Utena's parents died when she was a small child. Driven by despair she throws herself into the river. Then a noble prince rescues her, banishes her tears and gives her strength to grow and be noble. From that day forward she aims to become a prince, just like him. The illustrations are well-done and the writing style is quick and I must say that I truly enjoyed it. I can not wait to read part 2 of this series."
2,"The musical style of the songs on this cd is not salsa. It is Christmas music with a ""latin flavor"".","I bought this cd because it is entitled ""Salsa Christmas"". The music on this cd is not salsa music at all. The songs are Christmas songs performed with a ""latin flavor""."
2,An interesting read,Scheme itself is a terse declarative programming language with few (more likely zero) industrial uses. However the important and fundamental concepts in computer science are well demonstrated by the authors here. The book does serve fairly well as preparation for SICP but if that is the books purpose then the authors may as use raw mathematical predicates which is alot easier to read than Scheme code. The library code provided by the authors is vital for doing the exercises and codingwithout these is not considered making the book a weak reference manual. The book is also too long for a single semester course which means you may as well undertake Knuth's volumes if you are in a long course.
5,An excellent read for the general public,"An excellent read for the general public as well as for Military hounds. Read the biographies of over 100 women who fought for Russia during WWII, 100 female heroes that many, in fact most of us have never heard of. These stories will shed quite a different light on pre cold-war Russia, the World Wars, and the ""typical"" Russian woman. A must read for all women's studies.Leslie Blanchard--A Writer's Choice Literary Journa"
5,"Awesome camcorder, I love it!!","It does everything I expected and more. Very happy with the Mac compatability and ease of use. Great camcorder, highly recommend it!"
4,BROADCAST CAMERA ALMOST,"I JUST RECEIVED THIS CAMERA TODAY.AND I MUST SAY THIS 3CCD CAMERA GIVES A GREAT PICTURE.I HAVE BEEN IN THE VIDEO PRODUCTION BUSINESS FOR OVER 25 YEARS,DOING WEDDINGS,CABLE PRODUCTIONS.WORKED WITH A LOT OF BROADCAST CAMERAS.WHICH ARE $10,000 cameras.I OWN A KY27 JVC BROADCAST CAMERA WHICH PUTS OUT 750 LINES 65DB SIGNAL TONOISE RATIO.THIS CAMERA IS CLOSE.INDOOR SHOOTING IS NOT BAD A LITTLE ON THEGRAINY SIDE BUT WITH A GOOD VIDEO LIGHT THERE IS NO PROBLEM.ALL CONSUMER CAMERAS HAVE A LITTLE GRAIN.BUT WITH PROPER LIGHTING YOU CANOVER COME THIS.I TOOK THIS CAMERA OUTSIDE.GREAT VIDEO,COLOR.I DID NOT CARE FOR THE DIGITAL CAMERA PHOTOS ARE NOT THAT GREAT.I DIDNOT BUY THIS CAMERA FOR THAT ANYWAYS.VERY NICE CAMERA YOU WONT BE SORRY. PAID $850.00"
5,Best Mini DV Standard Definition Camera,PROS* Large 3 CCD produces amazing colored images.* Image Stabilization System does magic* Mini Dv tape has the best transfer rate which needs low video compression.* Mini DV tapes are low cost media* Stereo MIC input
2,"Disapointed, sent back","I am by no means an expert on electronics of any kind. I wanted a camera that would be simple and better than average in low light. This camera was simple to use but the quality of the picture was very disapointing. It does terrible in low light and it shakes. It is also quite heavy. I knew it would be heavier than the compact video cameras but I thought that was because of all the extras this camera would provide. It doesn't so I sent it back and got a Sony DCR-HC26, much cheaper and the quality is better in my opinion."
2,Too Big and Heavy,"I bought this camera to replace a PV-GS200 which died in a canoeing accident. It's about twice as heavy and much larger than the GS200, and other than the greater still picture resolution offers no other advantages. I truly wish Panasonic had not killed the former 3CCD camcorder line -- they were excellent, and the new ones are less sophisticated and much less convenient. It's unlikely I'll feel like lugging a four-pound machine around, so chances are I would leave this one home, and miss all the video I want to shoot."
4,Great economical 3CCD video camera. Works with OS X.,I have no complaints about this camera. Very happy with my purchase. It does the job and captures great video. And I have had no problem transferring video via Firwire running OS X on my MacBook using Apple's Final Cut Express HD software.
4,Good unit,"This is pretty much exactly what you would expect. It definitely seems nice and sturdy. I received the unit, put my gear in it, and set it under my desk. I haven't really abused it much, but it does it's job nicely, and looks good."
1,For Advanced Origamists Only!,"My daughter and I are fairly good at origami. We have found every item in this book to be impossible, even the supposedly easy ""1 Star"" items. The directions say things like ""rabbit ear fold"" but ""rabbit ear fold"" is not in the book. There is tons of little niggly folding (19 folds for the tail of a whale) that it seems they could do in fewer steps. They also don't tell you which part you are folding, so you can't use ""the big picture"" to do our folding when you don't understand the step-by-step directions."
5,A classic.,"Lang and Montroll create amazing models here. Unlike 4-leg animals, sea life creatures are hard to fold due to their special symmetries and forms. Both authors develop new skills to solve this problem, and the result is some unbelievable models: a blue crab, a lobster(with 8 legs,two claws, even 2 eyes), a murex, a lionfish. This book is really a classic."
5,Great fish models,"Yes, this is an intermediate folders book, but its nowhere near as hard as Lang's Insect book. If you can fold the other Montroll models you can do the ones in this book. There are some easier models, basic fish, with the hardest being those with the most appendages, crabs etc. But I like folding fish. Origami just lends itself to fish models and these are wonderful."
3,Not too bad...,"This book is JUST okay as an exam prep/review book. Some subjects are glossed over quickly and some are covered in detail. The fact that this book covers the browsing service whereas the Exam Cram one doesn't gives this book an excuse for existing. Again, not too bad..."
1,Lookout Remake Alert!!!,"Later in his career Charley Pride did a massive recording session where he re-recorded all his biggest hits.At the time it was well intentioned because almost all of the original versions of these songs were unavailable.But be forewarned, the songs on this disc are all remakes."
2,mediocre,"I have 20 versions of The Planets. This is down towards the bottom of the pile.The detail is not very good, nor is the sound quality.Mars, one of the more difficult pieces to pull off, conveying menace and vigor, is simply rushed, and not at all convincing. The sound is not well balanced, and the horns are blaring.But neither are the other characters drawn properly. Saturn is a mostly a dirge that rouses to life a few times. Uranus, the Magician, should have some mystery with its power. Steingberg conducts Uranus like it's a musical hammerhead shark. Neptune is more twiddling than mystical delicacy.The whole symphony sounds like the conductor was just going through the paces, without thinking of what the symphony was about.Recommended: Boult, Ormandy, Karajan, Mehta, Dutoit, Maazel, Bernstein, each satisfying in their own way."
5,Awesome Book!,"All I can say is, this book is amazing. I loved it so much. I cannot wait for Kelly's next book."
3,giving them to the kids,"These beef sticks have a different texture than what I prefer. They're quite a bit ""mushier"" than say, a slim jim, or my grandpa's pepperoni sticks. I've been giving them freely to friends' kids that visit, as I don't really care to save them for myself, AND the mushy texture means the kids can consume them safely, even the younger (3 years old) ones. The taste isn't bad, but coupled with the texture - they're not my favorite."
4,EXTREMELY FUN!,"but needs a few minor adjustments. First of all, the game is so dark you practically need a 500 wat light bulb just to see it. The gameplay is good and I really like the card system. It is also very challenging. This is also the first 2d Castlevania game since Symphony of the Night.I recommend this game to any Castlevania fan out there. I also can't wait for Harmony of Dissonance and White Night Concerto!"
4,pretty good game,"This game is really good!!!!!!!!!! The magic system is pretty cool and the graphics are good. The storyline is pretty vague though. Most of your time will be spent fighting monsters and trying to get to the next part of the castle. The only reason why I gave this game a four instead of a five is because it is a really dark game and at some times it is hard to see, also you WILL get lost alot and wander around for awhile. But overall it is a very good game!!!!!!!!!"
5,Castlevania At It's Best!?,"Yes! The Castlevania for Gameboy Advance is far better than any other. At first this game might not apeel to you because it may seem to easy, well yes, the normal badguys in this game can get fairly easy at times when you build up your main charecter's stats. The boss fights however often get really hard, sometimes you may struggle for days trynig to get passed one boss, but it is well worth it. Another great thing about this game is that you will NEVER get bord, there are always badguys to kill and there is always a different path. Thats why Castlevania is one of (if not thee best) game for Gameboy Advance."
5,The Best Action/Adventure Game for GBA!!!!!!,No words.............THis is the best title availaible for the game Boy advance....What can you find in Circle of moon 1-Great Graphics(better than Symphony of Night)2-Excelent music and sound3-Challenging replay value( there is a lot of extra things you can search or do)This is a must have .
3,Just Okay,"Not as good as the original, but this is only my personal opinion, which may vary from another person review. The graphics are good and each level gets more challenging as you get further along in the game."
3,What's all the fuss?,"Hyperbole aside, this game is o.k. The graphics are o.k. The gameplay is o.k. (are you getting the idea?) Rent it first, before you shell out [price]for a game you may or may not like. Personally I found the super mario cartridge to be much more interesting and addictive."
4,This game is pretty cool!,This game is pretty cool. It is a little hard at times but all in all very enjoyable. At first it was kinda hard to get into but now i'm stuck to like a fly to honey. Thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Best of GBA,"This game is the best of GBA. It was the second game I got,and was far more satisfactory than the first game I got. There are new""DSS cards"" which let you use magic, second weapons, but it can be frusterating( i have been stuck on Dracula for 3 months now. I just can't seem to beat him.)"
2,I hate this game...,"If someone could tell me how to fend of the snakes and actully get to the first save point maybe I would like this game. This game is very dark and I have a hard time seeing anything without playing in a bright-lightened room. The music is really annoying and I had to finally turn down to sound. This game sounded and looked soo fun at their website but, now that I have it I'm very dissapointed."
2,INVISIBLE,"Ok, this may be a great game, but you really can't tell because the screen is friggin' invisible! It's so dark it's ridiculous! ARGGGGH! I can't even tell you how annoying it is, because it boggles my mind... how did they test this and not realise that it's so dark you can't make out any details?"
5,Long live 2d Castlevaina,"My favorite castlevainia game aside from the origional trilogy which is classic. This is a great revamp for the series, new characters, new weapons, cool new moves. This is Castlevaina awesomeness!"
5,"A very solid 2D adventure, even today!","This game was one of the first Castlevania titles to appear on the GameBoy Advance. It boldly decided to stay 2D in a time when the main Castlevania series was taking it's chances in the 3D realm. Circle of The Moon is a big adventure for such a small cartridge, yet it can be taken on in perfect bite-sized portions on the go. If you own DS or DS Lite and are looking to get into GBA games, this is the perfect place to start. This is one of the very best titles the GBA had to offer in its day. If this is something you're looking to buy, you should also pick upCastlevania Double Pack."
4,die hard,"i'll skip the usual rambling. the game it first does seem dull because of how slow nathan walks and the snakes on the ceiling are a pain in the ass to get past without getting poisoned. but once you get the dash powerup and a few of the weapon cards, the game starts to balance out into a decent game. the card setup within the game seems interesting but doesn't really belong. at this point i will say that the game overall was made for the castlevania fans and just about them alone, the average castlevania follower has to have some patience due to the amount of enemies attacking you and waiting for a chance to get through. most people with a good amount of time on their hands and an sp will probably be able to deal with its issues, but i don't recommend the game to the people with the original gameboy advance...the graphics are too dark...but with the light from the sp, the picture looks good and the darkness sets a mood well."
1,It's too dark !!,"I bought this game today and immediately returned it. The graphics were so dark that at times I felt it was unplayable. The store tried a second one in a second Game Boy, but it was the same. The actual picture looks nothing like the screenshots on their website, which were beautiful."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR GBA & NDS W/GBA SLOT,"one of the best games for gba!or if you have a NDS with GBA slot,this is the game to buy!this game offers a very high challenge and a lot of hours of fun"
4,Circle of the Moon ~ a must see.,"If you are a gamer who loves the castlevania games, especially ""Symphony of the Night"" Then you must check out Circle of the Moon, A very good game with fairly good music for the GBA."
1,No network support,"How many single user pc's are this security conscience???Per Targus, this device cannot log you into a network and there are NO PLANS to make it work with a network!!!!"
2,NOT PCMCIA,"I bought it after seing ""fingerprint devices"" used for security in notebooks. This is however a USB version, which for me makes it not too useful in a notebook. I will have to get PCMCIA version. This one will go back."
1,Freezing DVD - True Terror,"After being thrilled to find this classic Hitchcock series available, we are also plagued with problems of episodes freezing and being impossible to watch.Universal always seems to have been the low-budget studio, compared to Warner and Paramount, and it seems their low-ball production methods are now leading to flawed dvds.I recommend never buying one of their products unless you find sufficient reviews to show they have improved their quality-control and production standards. Whatever minor saving Universal gained from cheapo production standards is going to cost them in negative brand recognition and bad word-of-mouth. Beware!"
3,DO NOT BUY THIS BOX SET!!!,"""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" is/was a great show.I have read reviews from people who have bought this box set (Season 1) and they complain about the double sided disc freezing and skipping..etc.I thought maybe with the double sided discs, maybe their was a finger print on the disc or something.No!!!!! They are right.I have played these discs on a Sony player(which is fickle from time to time, DVD-R's are a problem), an RCA combo and a RADIO SHACK bargain DESAY brand, that will play anything!! You can use your DVD as a drink coaster and it will play on this unit.Still.it will freeze, jump chapters.This is B.S. I can't even watch some episodes.DO NOY BUT THIS BOX SET!!Great show, if it would PLAY!!!!Can I get Universal to give me my money back???Better than money....just a set that WILL PLAY!!By the way, how does episode 4 end. See....I don't know !!! The damn thing won't play the episode."
3,Warning: Defective DVDs,"Alfred Hitckcock Presents was one of the best TV shows of all time. Hitch's introduction and closing comments are witty, literate, sophisticated, and timeless. There has never been anything that compares. I watched this series as a child and was absolutely thrilled when these DVDs were released. However, I am very disappointed in the quality of the DVDs. Brand new DVDs should not skip and jump as these do (and cleaning them does not help)...In some episodes, I am only able to see the first 5-10 minutes, then it jumps back to the menu. When you're engrossed in a Hitchcock story and that happens, well...the only words to describe my extreme irritation with Universal's lousy quality would not be fit to publish."
3,Fantastic Content - Terrible Execution,"Would have been Five Stars if not for two complaints already mentioned here which I will second:1) Not all episodes play, despite no apparent scratches on a new CD. 2 Eps so far have stopped in the middle (Shopping for Death is one of them! argh!) I thought I had a faulty copy, but reading similar reviews it may be down to teh double-sided format. No wonder Dallas costs twice as much on single-sided CDs!2) The load screen for each episode is full of terrible SPOILERS so you must avert your eyes and just click PLAY right through them - or they wil GIVE AWAY the twists that make this series.These eps are some of the best TV I own. It's a shame the company didn't ensure they'd be viewable. You have no choice but to buy them if you want to see the season, though. Good Luck"
4,Entertaining DVD Collection Ruined by Terrible Packaging,"Although I am a huge Hitchcock fan I had only seen a handful of Alfred Hitchcock Presents before watching this collection. I loved sitting through almost every episode on this collection.The thing that kept this from getting a full five stars is that the packaging was terrible! No linear notes to be found and the bonus material (a 15 minute documentary) left a whole lot to be desired. Universal seemed to just want to capitalize on the Hitchcock name without doing any sort of work on this collection. This was highly disappointing.I look forward to Season 2 coming out and if it ever actually does, I hope that Universal puts a little more work into it."
4,Good evening,"When I'd hear the theme music to ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, I'd suddenly need a drink of water -- my excuse for getting out of bed so I could at least watch his introduction. And his introduction is sometimes more entertaining -- and thought-provoking-- than the story presented. Am delighted to have the complete first season to watch at my leisure, and they are the type stories one can watch repeatedly with their plot twists, study of human nature, the universal principles (and violations of same) presented in these tales. And Hitchcock's wry - and dry - humor is uniquely entertaining.Received the order on time and in great condition, though there is some issues with the quality of the DVDs -- have watched 3 of the 6 sides and on 2 have encountered a place where the DVD ""sticks"" but was able to fast-forward past that without losing appreciable continuity. Definitely recommend for any Hitchcock fan; hope to obtain AHP for additional seasons."
4,Classic Show,The Classics are on here. Alfred was one of the greats!!! You are sure to enjoy this DVD. Go ahead buy in confidence
4,Excellent if you like classics,It was a gift for a friend. Since he enjoys mystery he was more than happy to see this classic masterpiece.
2,Disappointing,"I ordered this with high hopes... I'd rarely seen a weak episode of this series. And the first one of the set, ""Revenge"", is a classic. Unfortunately, many of the subsequent offerings were quite weak. Perhaps every other one was at least mildly engaging... many of the rest were borderline boring, or even silly.On top of that, there were NO liner notes, the plot synopses (which you HAVE to see if you watch individual episodes) give away endings quite frequently, the sound quality is VERY poor, especially compared to the Twilight Zone first year set, and the DVDs glitch up often.Mainly interesting as a period piece, as well as for Hitch's quirky intros and outros."
3,"Some great episodes, but most fall flat","The best episodes of season one are: (Don't worry, I won't give away the ending)They are:1. ""The Creeper"" A woman lives in fear of a murderer who is terrorizing the neighborhood.2. ""Breakdown"" An executive driving from Florida to New York is paralyzed in a car accident3. ""And so died Rabiachinska"" A ventriliquist is accused of murdering a competitor...Great performance by Claude Rains, by the way4. ""Revenge"" A man seeks revenge on the man who attacked his wifeAs for the other episodes, sad to say, some are downright boring, consisting of people(usually with British accents)standing around talking, and talking, and talking, and nothing happens.Another gripe I have are the menus. Instead of just setting up the premise, they give away the ending!"
5,Is There A Better Purveyor of Mystery?,"I do not think there is a better purveyor of mystery thrillers than Alfred Hitchcock. I have recorded Hitchcock marathons before on TVLAND or elsewhere. But there is nothing like clean crisp DVDs!With SEASON ONE on tap, I am now READY FOR THE REST! It might make me poor, but I will be happily poor with the outstanding half-hour (and later full-hour) vignettes to soothe my utter NEED for these superior quality productions.Bring on the rest! NOW!"
2,defect?,"Great show and packaging, however there's a problem with my copy, the second half of ""There Was An Old Woman"". It skips and can't be played at all, I've tried it on 3 different DVD players."
1,Marred by terrible sound and stupid episode descriptions,"I can't speak for subsequent DVD editions of other seasons of this stellar series, but this 1st season collection has abominable sound on many episodes and when you view episodes using the episode option in the menu it is preceded by a description that usually robs the episode of any suspense it contained. I'm sorry I bought it because the flaws take all the enjoyment out of what should be an exalting entertainment."
3,Disc Problems as Well,"Just wanted to verify that I, too, have had disc problems. This is on a new DVD player that plays all my other DVD's perfectly. Different spots at different times on different discs cause the screen to go blank, freeze or go back to the menu page. It's not often, or predictable, but it is a pain. Taking the disc out and blowing off dust, wiping in circular motion, etc. can fix it for the individual incident.The content is good. The shows are enjoyable. I am a big Hitchcock fan. This is the first series, and as such, is spotty in quality and entertainment value. I am also hoping for a better Season 2 in quality of product and production."
4,Hitchcock is finally here -these were big$$ on ebay before.,"This along with The Untouchables are 2 great classic TV shows that are now offered on DVD. Both are too pricey, that is why a 4 not a 5."
5,Good Collection.,"I watched ""The New Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" which was aired 1985 on television. I'm just wondering, how did Alfred Hitchcock hosted the program? Imagine he died 1980, so who is the Alfred Hitchcock in the 1985 Alfred Hitchcock Presents?I compared the episodes that we're in colored and remake, I prefer this original black and white. But it's better that they will release a colorized version of this Black and white, and not a colored remake version. Because the actors in original episodes are better compared to the new remake episodes."
2,Memories are Best,"I loved Alfred Hitchcock Presents when it was a regular TV series. I did not see the first two seasons, however. I think the really memorable shows, like ""Lamb to the Slaughter,"" came later. The shows I've watched so far (not even half of those included) show their age. I'll doubtless buy the other seasons when they are available, There was also an AH series in which the programs were an hour instead of a half hour, and I hope that they will be available.Forty years on I can still remember the plots of some of them."
4,"Some chapters excellent, some bad","Many chapters are very good but some are kind of ""so?"" Alfred HItchcock was great at producing but really bad at acting and sort of too protagonist in every chapters presentation"
1,Not as good as I remembered...,"I purchased this collection, happy to have the first season of what I remembered as one of my favorite childhood programs. Unfortunately, this isn't very good in retrospect. Where The Twilight Zone is BETTER than I gave it credit for back in the day (I couldn't really understand the subtext) this pails in comparison.I honestly have only seen two of the discs, and jumped through most of the episodes once the hooky plot had been established. This is third rate Hitch. A really sad waste of talent and effort. It is amazing it went on for six seasons. Maybe some individual episodes aren't third rate silliness. The 'send them to the cornfield' episode is included here. WAY sad compared with how frightened it made me as a kid.Not recommended, except maybe as a rental from the Library."
3,Somewhat disappointed...,"As a fan of the show, I was looking forward to buying this collection. I began watching Season One yesterday, starting with the ""Bonus Material"", ""A Look Back."" I found that to be rather shallow. Norman Lloyd was particularly annoying (in my opinion) with his recollection of the show. I also found the quality control to be below what I was expecting. For example, if you watch the credits for the first episode, they're ""tearing"", which is a result of a very high video level. How can that be? Then they edited out the commercial ""bumpers"", which is just wrong. I sincerely hope Universal comes up with better bonus material for the rest of the series, like the alternate intros Hitchcock did for the european versions, or the daytime promotional film he did to promote the show to women during the day (in re-runs)."
3,Same boat as everyone else,"Sad to say the first disc of this set locked up in the fourth episode. Went on Hulu to finish watching the last 10 minutes. Watched 6 or 7 episodes, and so far that was the only hitch. I also agree that it is hard to get to an episode deeper into a disc. Chapter skipping is the only way I have found to do so. love the shows though. Not deserving of the bad quality discs."
1,Bad double sided Disks,"The first time disk 3A was bad. Amazon quickly set a replacement set. The second time disk 3A and 2B were bad....Double sided DVDs are a bad thing...Other then that it's a great DVD set, good video and audio quality. (Not perfect but good.)"
2,What Happened??!!,"I am torn about how many stars I should give this release.As far as the stories go, they are great. I always lovedthis show, BUT, as far as quality goes. TERRIBLE!They should have done better with this.Very grainy, scratch lines throughout.Also, EDITED??!!Not worth the money.Alfred would be VERY disappointed!"
2,Poor Quality Universal Discs Again!,"Universal disappoints again! This is the fourth dual-sided Universal disc set I've purchased that has problems. Surely it can't cost that much more for them to put these series out on discs of consistent quality that actually play correctly! It is a travesty to put so many quality shows--this one, The Outer Limits, Emergency! and Adam-12 are the ones I have--on such poor discs. I love this show, but I sure wish Universal cared enough about these shows to put them on discs that work. I'm so tired of this that I'm increasing my star deduction to three due to the consistently poor quality of Universal's discs."
2,QUALITY CONTROL STRIKES AGAIN!,"Universal's poor dvd quality has once again ruined a much anticipated viewing experience for me. So far, I've played the first 5 episodes, and 2 of them have frozen up mid-way. This is the same problem I had with their ""FRANKENSTEIN"" and ""MUMMY"" box sets. Looks like the double-sided discs just plain SUCK. The problem is, you can't really return these discs, only exchange them, so there's no guarantee the next set won't freeze just as bad in a different location. The earlier reviewer that stated it must be the fault of the DVD player couldn't be more wrong. I own 4 machines of various qualities and ages, and these discs freeze on all 4. After this, I won't be purchasing Universal double-sided discs again. The overall picture and sound quality seemed great, but again, who need the frustration of dealing this."
3,The Good and the Bad,"Overall, I enjoyed this DVD set. However, the ""twists"" that end most of the shows do not hold up as well as The Twilight Zone; there are some quality problems - there were parts when the DVD would freeze as my player tried to correct errors; I'd suggest that you make sure not to read the synopsis prior to each episode. As mentioned previouly, they give away the endings(Bad idea, Universal)."
2,"GREAT SHOW, POOR QUALITY DVD!!!","please pay attention to the other reviewers that have complained about the dvd's freezing and skipping. they tell the truth. on disc one , the fourth episode ""don't come back alive"", the show froze not allowing me to see the final few minutes. maybe it is the double sided discs. my player is a high end denon and fairly new. the episodes i have seen have been great. it has been nostalgic seeing all the old stars in their early roles, too bad this set has all the technical problems!"
3,Buying Hitchcock By The Pound,"Well, OK, the Master did sell himself. He liked money and the things it could buy, so he lent his name and image to this fairly so-so TV series.As you consider buying this anthology DVD set, then, look at it as getting Hitch by the pound. For the money, you get hours of stuff you can watch while ironing or running your washing machine. And, whenever Alfred himself takes the stage, you can count on some funny business and great, droll props.Only one or two of these episodes, though, bear his personal mark. ""Revenge"" is almost worth the price of the whole series, in my view.So, consider buying it by the pound. The quality of the restorations is great, and it looks mighty fine on your video shelf.Beside,s don't you have some ironing to do?"
1,"The show is great,, but the product is junk","I'm not going to slam one of the best shows that's ever been on TV, so look to another review if you want to read what an amateur critic has to say. But I have a serious problem with any company that sells me a product that does not work. I actually bought 2 of this product, thinking I somehow got a freak defective set and just ordered another one and paid for them both. But neither of them play without an occasional freeze up during playing, and one of them just flat will not play all the way through. I'm not a penny pincher and I don't have time to go running to the post office every time somebody rips me off, so they can have my money that they stole from me. But if I were you, I'd buy another product. I got season 2, and it seems to be ok."
5,Lewis Excels,"Franklin Lewis's scholarly approach to the life, teachings, and poetry of Rumi is quite refreshing in this New Age era. The summary above includes my general sentiments, although I found the accents helpful in learning to pronounce the proper names. My favorite part of the book was the analysis of the Rumi ""translations."" I also enjoyed the fresh translations included in this book and would like to see more. Overall, an A+ approach for those of you who want a serious Rumi work."
3,Bathroom Update,I was changing the bathroom fixtures from brass to chrome. This faucet handle set did not work as a replacement for the existing brass set. In ordering this product it was very important for the description to give detailed dimensions to prevent having to return it. In the case the dimensions were lacking and I had to return it.
3,Hmmm...,"The Mendelssohn concerto is truly one of the greates concertoes of all time,and Bruch's pretty good too, but I don't think that Anne Sophie Mutter gets the right feel. It drawls along at a slow pace, and the seperate bowings ruin the fluid feeling of the piece. I guarantee that you will like the pieces, but I reccomend the version with the Budapest Symphony orchestra and Emmy Vehrey if you want good performance."
5,Great book!,"Beatifully written, Inspiring, great book. I have read it several times and always I find it so inspiring, tears coming down my cheeks while reading it."
3,recommended for juvenile deliquency courses,"I purchased this book used from amazon seller at excellent price and brand new condition. It was required for a college course, I found some chapters to be boring but others were interesting and reading it helped me score a good grade in juv del course:)I would recommend this book for somebody as a supplement text for juvenile deliquency courses, i do not think it was interesting enough for leisure reading and would not have read it had i not been taking course that recommended it."
1,Very poor quality,"The transfers on this set are very poor. I only bought it because this is the only set that includes Champagne (one of Hitch's minor works). If you are looking for a early Hitch set, consider the much better Laserlight set."
1,Mastered from VHS,"Just watched the transfer of CHAMPAGNE contained in this set. Unbelievably, it's been mastered from a VHS tape! A heavily scratched VHS tape!!"
2,The Essential Alfred Hitchcock Collection,"The movies on this DVD are all silent!! I bought these as a gift for someone who had never seen a Hitchcock film. I never thought that they would all be ""Silent"" and in Black and white!"
1,Fathers Little Dividend,This DVD is probably a bad dream. How can anyone allow this to sell.The picture is very very bad ... even the old VHS has never been such.The disc went right to the trash. He had already warned me that a bad year on the package.The film not from 1941 but 1951!There probably has the best quality DVD from DigiComTV ...
2,Stinky Stinky Stinky,"I don't know if one could overcome the smell of this product to enjoy the benefits it claims. I am a loyal user of Mary Kay products, but this product took me off guard when I used it."
2,Did not work,I used this product for over a 6 months. The puffiness and darkness under my eyes were not reduced. The product did not work for me.
1,Burned my skin!,"I used this product for about a week...after the first few days, I noticed that the skin around my eyes had become a little sensitive. A couple of days later, my skin burned like crazy from saline solution when I put my contacts in. So I stopped using the eye revitalizer. The skin under my eyes was ok - just sensitive. But the skin where crows feet would be, had burned and blistered from this stuff. My skin is normally not super sensitive, so I don't know if I just got a bad batch or what...but if I could, I would give my rating zero stars. I still had dark circles and puffy eyes, PLUS chemical burns. At least MK has a money back guarantee."
1,Irritating,"This product really irritated the skin under my eyes. I am still having problems getting it cleared up. If it starts to burn and sting, discontinue it right away!"
1,Nothing it promises to do.,This product was a waste of money it did noting to remove the small dark circles I have under my eyes. Its a waste of money. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Thank You
1,It Just Plain Stinks,"I haven't used this product long enough yet to really be able to say whether it helps puffiness and dark circles, although I will say it is nice to be able to use it twice a day without it causing any issues under my makeup. As others have said, the roll-on applicator is wasteful. But the worst thing about the product is that it really, really smells bad. Like it's soured or something. I hate to even wear it to bed because I know if I can smell it my boyfriend can too. It would be a pretty good product if they could just add something to it that smells good. If I didn't feel so bad about asking, I'd get my money back on this (and I may still do that)."
1,The Smell makes this a deal breaker,I cannot use it because of the very offensive odor. I think that everyone picks up different notes so some people only smell the citrus but I cannot take it at all. It is unfortunate because it is such a good product with amazing results.
3,It smells like my son's basketball shoes.,"I can't get past the smell. I thought I received an old outdated bottle but after reviewing some of the other reviews, this is how the product smells. My husband thought our son needed new shoes when in fact it was me!"
2,Stinky feet,"I've only been using it for a few days so I can't say whether it works or not, but I wanted to see if anyone else had anything to say about the smell or if my bottle was bad. I hope it works because it's expensive and it seriously reminds me of my brothers stinky socks and shoes when we were teenagers. If anyone has a teenage boy they should know what I'm talking about, and that's what this stuff smells like"
3,Coffee-Table picture book of Canadian Angels,Hells Angels Motorcycle ClubSimply put this is a picture book of Canada's Hells Angels with a brief history of the clubs expansion there. The photos are excellent and offer a study of the complex 'face' of the brotherhood that is the fabric of the Club. The motorcycles and the 'ole-ladies' featured are secondary to the 'artsy' mug-shots of the members. A good book to have around illustrating the 'outlaws' of today; especially for the priest or the mother-in-law to peruse as they wait in the parlor or the 'head'.
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book, for the price I was expecting much more. The photos are well done, I only hope that a similar book will follow to cover the United States,that would be truly of interest."
1,This must be a joke,How could anyone even consider publishing a photo journal of the HAMC without including it's american roots ? Perhaps the authors next endeavor will be a photo history of rock n roll with pictures of only the back street boys. This book is a disgrace.
4,"Great book, bad title","Since I own the hardcover of this book, I knew what to expect. I was not disappointed like some others were. I really really liked the new photos that are in this version of the book. I love the images and the insight into the bigger world of the HAMC, that it is a worldwide organization and that, like anything imported from anywhere, there is a local spin put on it by each culture. Here in the states we think everything is about us. American Idol is not an American show, we've just put our spin on it. I think the publishers (an English company) wanted to get the book to cross the pond by making the title so broad. They should have called it, ""Riding With The Hells Angels in Wankerland"" or something like that. Any other ideas? It's still a great visual glimpse into a world I missed out on growing up."
4,A good book about baseball.,This is a very good book about a minor league baseball player who gets sold to a very bad team. The team already has two firstbaseman and now they will have three. The book is very good but Dick Friendlich leaves you hanging at the end of the book.
2,Get Mario Kart!!! this game is not worth it!,"i bought this game thinking it would be pretty good, and b/c Mario Kart wasn't out yet. i played mario kart on N64, and it was awesome! this game is a poor copy, and i'm glad they're out w/ gba mario kart now."
4,good game,This game is great! It has great graphics. Although I like Mario Kart better this game is still great. I would give it a 9/10 rating It is a great game. It is amazing to me because all that amazing graphics can all show up on nintendo's GBA's tiny screen.
3,To easy!,"....The graphics are nice, and the game play is solid, but it was WAY to easy! I beat everything (in Normal), including the S license tracks, in less then 10 hours of play. Because of that I don't recommend you buy this game unless you have friends/family that already own it and can take advantage of the multi-player options. The single player mode is just to short, and you'll quickly grow bored if that's all you can take advantage of.Dan"
3,Not Best But Okay.,"Krazy racers does a pitiful job of keeping the game long, but at first its fun, and the graphics are pretty good. It would probably take an unexperienced gamer just a few hours to beat the whole game."
3,read this review (its short),"Wait till mario kart advance, this is just a game that did a bad job trying to copy it."
1,terrible game,First of all the only thing good about Konami is Castlevania. All other games stink and this one takes the cake. If you want a good racing game reach for F-zero or mario kart super circuit not this garbage
4,mario kart is better but...,if you cant find it buy Karzy racer.Like the mini games on mario kart are better and more difficult however Krazy racer did come out first.Second the Graphics on mario kart are better then the ones on Krazy racer.but the races and items on Krazy racer are better.
5,Mega Game!,"I personally own a GameBoy Advance and have played Krazy Racers. I can tell you that it is a brilliant game and definately worth getting! If you compare this game to Mario Kart advance the first thing you will notice is that in terms of looks and visual effects it outrates those of Mario Kart.The second is that the weapons/power ups are more hilarious and creative eg.you can zap your enemies with batteries and frost all the roads with ice (so that they slide out of control).The game features four modes(grand prix,time trial,free run and mini battle).you can also play multiplayer. The characters may be familier to Kanomi fans but others will just have to discover them.The game includes 8 characters like Mistical Ninja's Geomon and Castlevania's Dracula.There is also a hidden character.There will be special coins scattered throughout the 16 courses.Collect them to upgrade your karts.This game is brilliant,you just have to get it!"
5,AMAZING,"The first night I brought the book home I read it to my kids (ages 4 and 6) and the just loved it, they ask for me to read it to them all the time. The illustrations are wonderful and very detailed, when Alfie gets cold you almost shiver with him. My children loved the book and so will yours."
3,Iceland Guidebook,"This is an informative guide to Iceland. However the previous owner cut out quite a few pictures, I can't imagine why they would do that.Too lazy to take a camera?? Maybe they didn't go and this was all they wanted."
4,4 star's for fun,haven't been to Iceland yet so i have yet to test the knowledge and accuracy of the book. hoping to go this fall! will return with full report.
1,haven't received it yet,maybe it's in the mailliked a McKee seminar I attended years ago. Thought the book would be useful today.
5,A fumdamental necessity.,"This is, by far, the best book out there for aspiring screenwriters. It's completely comprehensive and McKee uses many examples from well-known movies to convey his points. I would credit McKee for giving me the clarity I needed to truely begin the learning process."
5,One of the best on fiction books I have ever read,I want to go into the film industry as a writer and began writing scripts. My whole world changed upon picking this book up. It changed my whole way of thinking and completely changed my writing. A definate must read for anyone interested in writing or anyone just interested in how films work.
4,"Practical, easy-to-understand screen writing resource","This book by Robert McKee is anexcellent resource for creating an involving screenplay. I am a novice when it comes to screenplays and ""Story"" was a great way to get a first look at the art of writing screenplays."
5,Absolute Best,"This is the absolute best book on screenwriting on the market. I have read 100s of them, and this is by far the one that gives the most detail, the most logical advice, and the best how-to information for screenwriters new and old. This is an absolute must have for all screenwriters. I can't wait to take his course!"
4,"Story, a sensible approach...","The maths of story telling? Is that possible? How can you teach that?The fact that in 2011 he was teaching his 4 day seminar in Bogotá, Colombia and the following year in Hyderabad, India suggests McKee has something of value to say.Perhaps a better way of putting it would be to say this a sensible, practical book.What's good is that McKee channels The Poetics and others. But what's better is that he's not afraid to say it. He knows he's not saying anything new and he'll admit it too: ""The world is full of people who teach things they themselves cannot do.""What's important is that McKee makes you re-focus on, well, story, and isn't that what the book is supposed to do."
5,Story,"This a very good book on screenplay story telling. After reading this book, I understand exactly what it takes to write a viable screenplay. I even can predict other movies that I watch just based on the theory presented in this book. Movies that don't follow this recipe are the ones that aren't very good. I find that the movies that do follow the theory presented in STORY, have the best ratings. This is a must get book if you are serious about writing screenplays."
3,VERY DETAILED BUT VERY DRY,"Robert McKee's resume as a screenwriting guru is impeccable. Personally I find his style to be far too rigid for my tastes. Still, I keep this book as a resource because McKee provides hundreds of examples to of how to write a scene and create a screenplay sequence. Overall, this book is good for the left brained folk, not so great for the right brained folks"
2,Very formulaic and by the numbers.,"I felt the book was too much a paint by numbers approach to screenwriting. Having graduated from the Masters Screenwriting Program at UCLA and having studied at the feet of some of the best writers in Hollywood, I know that writing a screenplay is dynamic and every story unique in structure and potential. While there are structural elements necessary in almost every screenplay, the vision for writing a screenplay must be approached with emotion and passion! Lew Hunters 434 is a much better book!"
3,Cliche Ideas on Cliche and NO Solutions,"With all the fanfare around this book I would have thought there would be a bit more meat to it but unfortunately there was not. The pages in this book give no more help than critique from an independent party on your story. McKee always uses the same movies as his base from which he states that most stories fail the audience and his ideas are nothing new, just long winded. If you never studied creative writing or have never written and are thinking of doing it, this is a good book. If you are already a writer and know about all the rules and have already heard the typical critique on form and function, then avoid this book."
4,Authoritative - readable,The only problem I have with this book is McKee's attitude. He writes without humility. There are other ways to tell stories. But it's an engaging read and contains a lot of useful information. And is the BIBLE in H.Wood (where I live)... so... I recommend it.
4,Excellent,"What can I say...this book is friggen sweet.It's helped me write quicker, with more depth and to be viciously critical of my own work, it's a great read on all the essentials of a good story for the screen and what can make a great story into an unforgettable one. It was great to read through and apply what I had learned to my own writing. It's also a great book to have sitting close to your desk for when you get into a tight spot."
5,Great for Any Writer of Fiction,"There is no writer who cannot benefit from this book, whether you are a novelist or a playwright or a screenwriter. McKee is a terrific analyst and gives you the tools to analyse the scenes of your story. In an era in which structure and form are as important as the ability to create good characters, McKee provides the key to building your story so that it does what you want it to do. You cannot go wrong with the book, and the examples from movies are fascinating and illuminating."
2,"Too much breaking down, not enough putting together.","I have read a few screenplay writing books and regularly refer to a couple of them. I do not think this one will make the cut. Here is why: Yes, the book goes to great lengths in analyzing and re-analayzing and cutting and slicing story structure. The problem is it does too much of it. It does this until the pieces become so small that everything seaps through the sieve. As you read the book, you keep expecting that the author will start putting pieces together, but it never happens.I heard the author's seminars are a very enjoyable due to his performance. I am afraid the book is just a very profitable business idea, an afterthought... for him."
5,Great Starting Point.,"You have an idea for a movie script, but are just looking at a blank white piece of paper. Here's a book that will get you going in the right direction."
5,This is the story book you're looking for,"If you want to write better stories or find out if you've got what it takes to write...get this book. You'll be inspired, you'll be challenged, you may end up depressed. But, in the end, you'll be able to create a better story. Or, at the least, you'll know you shouldn't force someone else to read you story and tell you it's bad."
5,Brilliant and Very Helpful,"I recently took McKee's 3-day marathon ""STORYSEMINAR"" in L.A. It was almost like a religious experience -motivating, informative, inspirataional, etc. I highly recommend taking it if you haven't. The( ) price is steep, but more than worth it. The book is an incredible companion, and an outright necessity, for taking the seminar. For all of the brilliance offered in the book, the seminar really opened the doors even wider in helping me understand the theories and principles McKee presents in the book. Definitely 5 stars for the book, 6 for his Seminar. END"
4,A great read! You'll probably enjoy this!,"No one writes with more passion and authority than Mr. McKee. He never recommends formula. He points out principles, that if followed, will keep you honest and aware and appreciative of this art form. His writing is free of cynicism, and if he occasionally wanders into the intellectual, he can be forgiven. There is more helpful advice in this book than any three I've ever read, including Ms. Seger's. I highly recommend it. Were I still teaching screenwriting, I would require it."
1,Outside Looking In,"What a disappointment. McKee starts from the premise that there's the right way and the rest is for those who haven't attended his lecture or read his book. So much hangs on structure and the formula of what's worked before and so little is devoted to what matters; characters. If you want to work in Hollywood, but it."
3,"story, substance, structure, style and the princples of screenwritiing","I am in a novel workshop. The author's priciples of what make a good story will apply here, too. I enjoyed his take on the craft."
2,"Don't listen to this tape while driving, you could zzzzzzzz","I bought this audiotapes because of the comments of other users, but I am really disappointed. Is very boring. It does the opposite of what its title claims. The audio tape has no story, substance, structure. The version I bought has six tapes, but in the first ten minutes of the first tape I begun to feel bored, so, if it were a script I would passed it, but I gave it a chance, so I listened more, more, and the more I listened, the more bored I got. I went to the library to check the print edition, and it was the same. I don't understand why it is so popular. I don't know about the seminar, maybe is great and that is why he is so popular, probably the book came after the seminars, but didn't get the substance.Hauge or Froug audiotapes are better and full of useful content."
1,Buy A Different Book,"...This overblown, unnecessary book is pedantic and clearly McKee is enamored with the sound of his own voice (literarily speaking that is).He forces the reader to wade through such incredibly insignificant minutae on the most basic of principles. Here is someone that's set out to be the screenwriting ""guru"" and write his own ""definitive bible"" and so has invested hours and hours of his life coming up with unecessarily complex systems and structures to support his stature but offers no real insight.There are so many other better screenwriting books available. ... Spend your money there instead."
4,"Story: Substance, Structure, Style...",Got this used and at a reasonable price.Got it yesterday and flipped through it a bit.Like it already and ready to start reading. :)
5,Thought Provoking,"McKee's book is tremendously thought-provoking and it's well worth taking a great deal of time to digest his ideas and advice. For anyone who is seriously interested in thinking about what makes a story worth reading or watching, this is one of the best books available."
5,Sophisticated concepts from an industry legend,"If you've ever heard Robert McKee speak, you know he doesn't pull his punches. He's arrogant, irascible, and probably one of the most brilliant instructors on the art of storytelling. In STORY, McKee covers everything from the basics of plot and character, to the more sophisticated aspects of the craft, such as the use of irony and imagery as they relate to an audience's (or reader's) collective subconscience. This is meaty stuff, and lots of it, delivered in a very readable format. An excellent resource for the advanced writer. (For a list of additional must-have writing books, visit the Resources page at WriteWayPro's website.)"
5,Excellent take on screenwriting,"I've read most of the ""important"" screenwriting books, but found McKee's to be the most insightful about what I - and I think many others - view as the most important aspect of a film (and often lost or ignored in so much crap coming out of Hollywood these days) - the STORY. This is a really good read."
4,Bible for screenwriting,"Mckee's book is famous and hardly needs someone like me to review it. This is the bible of screenwriting. With that said, there are a lot of basics in here that advanced screenwriters always follow, but are beyond. It is a quick and interesting read that you will benefit from. After reading it, pick up the film Adaptation and laugh out loud."
1,"Overwrought, overthought, overcompliated. Get Syd Field instead.","McKee is responsible for making the lives of screenwriters a living hell because movie executives go to his seminars and think they know about ""story"".McKee over-complicates the screenwriting process by stymieing writers with way too many rules. Good thing Quentin Tarantino doesn't follow these rules.Seriously, the only books you need on screenwriting are the Syd Field books ""Screenwriting"" and ""The Screenwriter's Workbook"", and maybe William Goldman's Adventures in the Screen Trade.Aside from those works, get your hands on as many produced (and GOOD) screenplays as you can and read, read, read them.McKee will just distract you and get you thinking about rules that real filmmakers do not heed -- rules that would strip your story of all its fun, quirky, unique elements."
2,"Write the abridged version, please.","I am in a morgue with the author; he is conducting an autopsy. Strewn across the table lays the body of a story, bloated, maggot ridden, mouth agape, eyes bulging, staring up at me. I am gowned, goggled, gloved, a smear of vapor rub under my nose to mask the eye-watering stench. The author, scalpel and skewer in hand, slicing, jabbing, ripping, tearing, dissects the guts and organs of the story in long-winded, over-analyzed, often pointless detail; blathering story terminology, rancid lecturing, he rambles on and on, four hundred pages, which in spite of the vapor rub, still reeks of gagging boredom. Finishing, pushing the corpse off the table, sopping up the mess, trying desperately not to spit up my coffee, suddenly, to me, writing a story seems laborious and gruesome. Confused, bloodied, horrified, I think, `Can it really be this complicated?'I hope not."
1,Drivel,"Just look at the man's credits. He's never written a damn script!Read David Howard's work--a working screenwriter's advice, not some huckster."
1,Forget about this one!,"In short would like to say that this book is a nightmare to get through. McKee's writing style is so flowery and poetic, filled with 10 dollar words that detract from the point he is trying to make, the reader finds his mind drifting off the subject. I had to read certain paragraphs two to three times to even grasp what he was implying. UGH! There are much better books out there for script writing and structure. Try ""A Story is a Promise"" or ""Making a Good Script Great"" Now I am not saying there isn't some value in McKee's book. But for the price, and the three aspirin headache...as they say in Brooklyn FORGET-ABOUT-IT!!!"
5,A must have for any screenwriter!,"Nothing is a substitute for Robert McKee's seminar, but his book sure comes close. A well laid out reference source for even the experts and a must have for any new writer. Real and thought provoking advice."
5,the best book on script writting essence and technique.,"mckee writes an impartial view on what's writting quality for the screen. he destroys the myth of Hollywood x independent film and goes on to point where a scene w/ ingrid bergman and another written by ingmar bergman show brilliance and punch.reading mckee and understanding his concepts, you are much closer to quality writting than w/ any other method or school."
4,It just works!,Best hard drive enclosure I have found. It took about 10 minutes to set up (added a 750GB Seagate drive). I tried both the USB and eSATA without any problems. It's quiet too.
3,good but WARNING ! be careful installing......,Be very careful taking power leads off for fan and leds when installing hard drive. One came off motherboard and stopped working when pulled with minimal force. Otherwise I am very happy with product
2,Fan Will Fail Eventually,"I bought one of these from a local computer store about 1-1/2 years ago and it worked great until the fan failed recently. The fan has custom plastic molding and cannot be replaced. I recommend an enclosure that has an off-the-shelf fan in case it should require replacement, and ball bearing fans last longer. This Antec unit had a sleeve bearing which will fail much sooner."
4,Good External HD Enclosure,"Overall, a good case, if a bit cumbersome and noisy. The power switch and fan are a nice touch if you need that functionality.I bought it for use with a cable DVR, but ended up just using it attached to an Air Port Extreme Base Station (i.e., I turned it into a network attached hard drive). This works well.Installing a hard drive is a bit of a pain, but not really a big deal. Tiny screws in plastic. Eh - you only have to do it once.The fan, while good to have if you need it, is noisy. For my situation, it's not in an enclosed space, so I keep meaning to open up the case and unplug it. It looks like it's well enough vented that this would be fine.I would buy it again if I needed an external enclosure.As a side note, my overall experience with Antec is positive - they seem to make good products. I've purchased several computer cases and power supplies from them over the years."
3,Avg for Directv media,"I purchased this because it was suggested on the internet by other users for adding an external drive for increasing DVR hard drive space. I added a 1 Terbyte drive (seagate) to it becasue I keep running out of HD space on the Directv HD DVR. It keeps up better then the others I have tried but at first it could not keep up with the continues recording the DVR does. Now, about once a week, the Directv box gives a Gray screen as the DVR clears the HD cache because the e-SATA has a hard time keeping up with continues recording. It clears itself after about 10 minutes and it also causes freeze frames (jittery frames) from time to time and you have to reboot the DVR because the cache is full on the drive.This maybe better for General purpose use then continues recording like a DVR does."
4,Best fit case,"This is indeed a very good product from Antec. As many had said about its pros, i am gonna list few cons. There are no visible lights to see whether this unit is on or off...not a big deal unless you are figting with you pc to recognize your external HD. At that time it is quite annoying. I couldn't hear the fan running even when i take it close to my ears. I don't see a big difference in temperature too. May be the fan kicks in when the temperature is bit hot. My 1 TB WD Green runs quite cool and there may not be need for a fan cooling for it.Note that velociraptor drives wont fit the case. Velociraptor drives are actually 2.5"" drives with heat sink making them the size of 3.5"" drives. But, when i wanted to connect that to take backup to my laptop, i removed the shell and it is quite easy to connect the circuit board alone to the velociraptor 300 and finish my backup."
4,"good enclosure, but eSata is not sata","This enclosure works great with the USB cable. If you have an eSata port on the back of your computer (directly on the motherboard) it works even faster. But if you hope to use the included eSata back-panel bracket that plugs into a regular sata port in your motherboard, be aware that sata is not eSata, and this *will not work* with some chipsets. In particular, it doesn't work with the nForce4 Ultra chipset or the Sil 3114 that are found on a Gigabyte GA-K8N Ultra-9 motherboard. It seems to depend on whether the timings of your motherboard sata ports happen to fall within the timing specs for eSata --- this can happen, but it is not guaranteed."
4,"Great product, great price!","Antec has always been my favorite case manufacturer. Their designs and sound dampening technology are always a cut above the rest. This external enclosure is no exception. It's easy to set up and easy to connect. My only complaint (and the reason I didn't give five stars) is that the on-board eSATA interface is recognized ONLY as SATA 3GB and thus can have some compatibility issues with older VIA SATA controllers. If Antec had included a jumper setting to set the device to SATA 150, this enclosure would be the perfect external drive solution."
3,Not That Great,"I use it with a WD 500GB hard drive. Sometimes my (XP) computers cannot recognize the device with message ""USB device not recognized"". I thought it might be a problem from the hard drive. And then I took the hard drive out and tested it on BlacX docking Station that I bought recently. The hard drive worked very well on the docking station. I googled for the problem and firmware and couldn't find anything useful.I gave it 3 stars because of the above problem and the following reasons:Positive: quite, cool, good-designed case, and easy to installNegative: loose power connector, and bad LED location"
4,Why 750 GB?,"Everything I read about this enclosure sounds good, but I don't understand this specification: ""Up to 750 GB 3.5-inch SATA hard disk drive""! One review said a 1TB drive was used. Why do the specs limit the size of drive??"
5,Antec MX-1 Review,"Today I purchased my second Antec MX-1 hard drive enclosure. My previous one now 2 years old is still functioning although it needs to be cleaned from time to time. The enclosure is quiet and functions as expected, is reliable and quiet. I use it to hold a 3.5 inch hard drive for my HD-DVR from DirecTV.Some people may find the blue light a bit bright for a bedroom, but I like to know the drive and fan are working. The instructions included in the packaging for set up are not very good, but there are a number of excellent instructional videos on YouTube.Overall I am very satisfied with this product."
3,fan is way too noisy,the enclosure is very nice. the rubber dampeners in which the hard drive sits on really help keep the noise and the vibration down. the biggest problem is the fan. the fan is obnoxiously loud. i had to unplug the fan because it was driving me crazy. i understand this isnt the highest qualitly case but they could have put a slightly quieter fan in there. wish i got the macally usb 2.0/esata enclosure instead
2,Good until it broke,"I have three MX-1's, and the fans have gone out on two of them. The fans are custom built into the drive carrier and cannot be replaced. The first time a fan went out, Antec customer support sent me a new carrier. The second time a fan went out, they sent me an email acknowledging receipt of my complaint, but they haven't sent me a new fan/carrier assembly or offered to sell me one if I am out of warranty. I've switched over to Thermaltake Max 5's, which have similar features, but their fans are standard and easily replaceable."
1,MX-1 Junk,I tried two of these from two different vendors and both had flaky power connectors at the enclosure causing power to cycle on and off with just a slight movement of the power cord. Totally unusable. I RMA'd both and went with a Thermaltake BlackX Docking station and it's working fine.
2,Just died suddenly after a year,"Was perfect, then simply ceased to work one day. Tried with Mac and PC, neither will recognize the device and Windows explicitly states that it has ""malfunctioned"".Finding a non-crap enclosure is tough!"
1,"Read access cuts out, slow transfer rate","This product connects easy enough but right out of the box it is a slow performer. I used a 1TB Western digital drive (supported) and the data transfer rate in and out is slow. I had installed the same drive directly inside a computer to make sure the drive was not the fault. The on day I gave it heavy use and it really started to fail. After a few months I had 5000+ 5-6 meg JPGs on the drive. I tried to XCOPY and file copy around 1000 of them to another drive. The drive in the unit keep giving a Read failure message. At first I thought the drive was bad so back into the computer it went where it performed great over and over. Once back in this product, failure over and over.If you have lots of files and work in bulk, SAVE YOUR MONEY."
1,DON'T BUY,"RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX,I OPENED THE HARD DRIVE I NOTICED THAT THE SCREWS HOLDING THE CIRCUIT BOARD WERE COVERED WITH RUST. WHEN I E-MAILED THE COMPANY THEY DIDN'T RESPOND FOR ABOUT 5 DAYS,AND NOT UNTIL I TOLD THEM THAT I WOULD BE CONTACTING THE BBB IF THEY DIDN'T WRITE BACK TO ME WITH A RMA #.STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE REFUND AS OF OCT 4."
3,Not that great,"The units I got are definitely not as good as the ones some online review sites tested. The fan in my first unit is kind of loud. I thought maybe I just got a bad unit. According to those online reviews, this model should be quiet, and mine is definitely not. I ordered a second unit later hoping that I would get the normal ones that are quiet... Well, the second one is just as loud. Frankly, I am a little bit disappointed. Maybe only the units sent to those review sites are quiet? These enclosures do work fine, using both the USB and eSATA interfaces, just not so great."
3,Very meh,"Everywhere I look, people seem to like this enclosure and I have a friend that's using one for a DVR drive, so I picked one up. I have to say I'm unimpressed, I find it too noisy, maybe I just have a bad one *shrug* The main positive is the main source of the noise, it's fan. It certainly does a good job of cooling the HD. Other than that, I find the enclosure a little bigger than most, a little more of a pain to install (I wouldn't recommend the MX-1 if you're going to be swapping drives often), and it being too noisy to run 24/7 in my bedroom."
1,Not reliable,"I bought two of these, the first one failed completely (noisy fan, bad USB port), the second one has a terribly intermittent power connector. I bought it for the eSATA capability but it gets a lot of delayed write errors due to the intermittent power connector. I have had good luck with the AcomData Samba enclosures I bought for the office, I will probably junk this one and get something more reliable."
2,It looses it sample,It looses it's sample as soon as power is lost to unit. This is a problem when you turn it back on and there is no sample to play that was stored.
2,"Mediocre, with factual errors",The careful reader will recognize enough factual errors in this book to be made uncomfortable with its scholarship and research.
3,These do work...,"These do work, I fall asleep after an hour and if I wake up in the middle of the night I go right back to sleep without a problem. The only downside is that I feel super drowsy the next morning, which wears off after a few hours."
5,they work,"i love unisom!they are non-habit forming which is definitely a plus!for me, they take about an hour to kick in, so i usually take it an hour or so before i plan on sleeping.the first time i tried them, i took 2 softgels [although the recommended dosage for an adult is one softgel] and when i fell asleep i couldn't even move.so follow the instructions, and take just one; it does the job!i don't have a problem with feeling drowsy when i wake up.in fact i feel well rested. i get a full 8 and even 9 hours of sleep."
1,Save your money,"These are made using the same chemical compound that Benadryl is made of, just buy the generic Benadryl at the store. It's alot cheaper"
3,Glasses on the cheap,"With shipping it adds up to about $3 a piece for these glasses. The lenses seem good with no obvious imperfections. Mounting is cheap, but stable. The price is incredible, especially if you are constantly leaving glasses somewhere other than where you want them, or losing them. My only complaint is the stems are too short. They are wearable, but I wouldn't want to use them except around the house, or at work. They are worth $18 bucks. If you don't like them you can always donate them to charity."
1,Not worth a penny!,I just wanted spare reading glasses around the house since I tend to misplace them so I ordered these inexpensive ones. Big mistake. Ill-fitting and warped vision. Not worth a penny!
1,clifford hall,Only got one pair of glasses when the offer said 6 assorted for 10.99. The merchant never sent the other five. A little bit of false advertising going on here. I have to rate this as very poor customer service. Here's the add cuted and pasted below.(Value Eyes Reading Glasses Assortment 6 for $10.99 (2.25)
2,Ugly Boring and Don't Stay On.,You can get better and more attractive glasses at the dollar store. If you have an average or small head these glasses won't stay on your face. I gave the glasses away to friends who had office for their clients who forgot to bring glasses.
3,Very professional and prompt,"When I encountered a product flaw, they were quick to send out a replacement as well as return postage."
2,cheapy reading glasses,"i've ordered these reading glasses before and was happy with them. But this latest shipment breaks very easy. Here's the story: I keep my glasses in the side pockets of my trousers and, after a while, the lens fall out of the frames. The last shipment was less prone to do that. Maybe i just got my money's worth, eh?"
4,Just want I needed,"I think they're a great value. I need them for reading and I've ordered them before. The frames are a bit flimsy, but, hey, for this price, they can't be beat! So, I'm back for more!"
1,tiny glasses,"Great price - I got what I payed for. Only problem is, they would only fit a child. What child needs/wants old man reading glasses? Glasses are like clothes in that we all have different size heads and width of eyes. Unless I can see the size of the eyewear, I will never buy eyewear online again."
2,Really flimsy,"These were really poorly made: I put a pair on and the screw holding the earpiece on fell out! This happened on 2 different pairs so I don't think it was a fluke. Other pairs of glasses in the pack had rough edges, making them uncomfortable to wear. I don't ask for much from glasses this cheap but I do insist that they at least be wearable."
2,reading glasses,These glasses are good for a spare set. They scratch very easily and are hard to keep clear. You get what you paid for.
1,CHEAP!!,"These glasses are flimsy. Also, they made me dizzy when I wore them for more than a minute or two."
1,Absolutely Unbelievable story,"This has got to be the worst Warhammer 40,000 book out there. It has the most absolutely unbelievable story. Bear with me if you don't play Warhammer 40k, because you may not understand the following: Basically a Small squad of Imperial Fist Space Marines, an Inquisitor, a Squat, an Astropath, and a Callidus Assasin break onto the Ulthwe craftworld, and waltz right into The Black Library, and take the books on the Rhana Dandra. And guess what? They only lose 4 marines too. The most powerful beings in the Galaxy, the Solitaires, couldn't even kill one of them.This book isn't worth the paper its printed on."
5,memories,This is a cookbook I grew up using. It has a diverse range of sweets and easy to follow directions.
3,Souls Harbor,"To me, this sounds a little like Disturbed - if you like groups like Disturbed, Drowning Pool - you should like this - its worth $4-5 bucks, but wouldn't pay full price for it."
3,No CC: on Short Circuit!,"I loved Short Circuit 2, but on this DVD, since I'm deaf, Short Circuit was a -- short circuit: There're no subtitles OR closed captioning for the movie, so for me it was a waste. I'll keep my old VHS tape for that. Why is there cc: on the tape, but not on the DVD? -- Not even ANALOG cc:, much less a menu with subtitles. CHEAP!"
1,SAD,"Never got to watch, opened it up to take the movie out and it snapped. I loved the movie when I watched it long ago."
4,"Good, nostalgic films",These are dvds of good movies. They work exactly as expected and the movies are just how I remember them.
3,"Cute, but stupid at times.","I think this is a cute movie, but it could of been better.In that bird cartoon, the baby birds are hungry, and one of them chases Lowly the Worm around, until Huckie the Cat gives them each some spaghetti noodles. If that scene was edited out, I would of given it a five!"
4,Amazon made it possible,A nice a good locking watch for girls and a perfect christmas gift.Thanks and we wish you a good chrismas time
5,Christmas Gift,"This was purchased for my 10-year-old granddaughter as a Christmas gift. My daughter-in-law said to get her some ""girly"" so this was it."
4,Cute basic watch for 5-8 year old girls,"Just wish the face on the watch was a little bigger. Otherwise, seems like a good solid watch for a 5 - 8 year old girl."
5,Adorable watch that really helps kids learn,"I bought this for my daughter's sixth birthday. She absolutely loves it. The band is soft and comfortable and the extra help on the watch face made a big difference when she learned how to tell time. The face of the watch scuffs easily, but the scuffs come off in seconds with a drop of toothpaste. The colors are fun and stylish. We've had this watch for more than a year and it still works and looks great. I would definately buy again."
5,time teacher by Timex,The Timex Time Teacher has been an excellent reinforcement for learning to tell time. Each second is labeled and has a second hand. The stretch material is perfect for a smaller-than-average wrist. We are very pleased.
5,Stretch band watch,"Great watch for kids and adults alike. As a school volunteer, I find the kids love checking out my watch. I also have skin allergies and these bands are AWESOME!"
4,hopeful,"hopeful that this product will meet the needs of my 7 year old daughter! also that it will stand the test of time with all a 7 year old gets involved in. haha, no pun intended. :)thank you for the good service!"
3,Lovely watch,"My 4-1/2 year old has shown an interest in learning to tell time, so I bought this for her. It's cute...the girly pattern certainly makes her interested in wearing it...and the soft band is comfortable. The main numbers are big; but I dock stars because the lettering on the hour and minute hand are SO tiny...even she can't see it. Additionally, there is the added ""15"" and ""30,"" but they are also small. And then they put ""15 of"" on the 9...which isn't helpful to a new learner."
4,"I love this watch, but my 4 year old is not interested.","I got this watch for my four year old because I want her to learn to tell time and she is always stealing my digital watch. Unfortunately she won't even wear it. She opened it at Christmas and immediately put it to the side. I am still giving it four stars because it looks like a good, well made watch. It looks just like its picture. I just wish the numbers and hands were a little bigger since it is supposed to be a learning watch."
3,"Great kids' watch, lousy band.","I'm buying this watch for the second time. The first one was lost on the second day wearing it. I can't blame my daughter for being irresponsible, my first thought after seeing the watch was that that band would fail. It was difficult to attach correctly and would loosen throughout the day, I didn't expect the watch to get lost, I just thought she'd need help re-attaching it again and again. We've concluded that her watch probably came off with her jacket sleeve, our family was visiting a crowded museum so none of us noticed right away.The replacement watch will have its band sewn closed at the appropriate size. The band is elastic, so she'll still be able to put it on.Timex has a $10 replacement policy, which I'll be taking advantage of, but my daughter was heartbroken and I know Amazon will have a replacement here faster."
2,Tinny numbers,"The picture is misleading - the numbers are very small. The band is cheap loking and too big for little girl's wrist. My daughter is 6 years old and we had to wrap it around almost 360. If you cut the band, the ends will run... We'll make it work but I wouldn't recommand it."
5,Review Timex Kids' T89022 Time Teacher Flowers Stretch Band Watch,"1. I am going to state the pros and cons of this according to my eight year old daughter.PROS2. The design is pretty.3. It glows in the dark.4. It makes telling, and learning how to tell time, time easy.5. It comes on and off pretty easy.6. It is lightweight.CONS1. The band is not water resistant and so the watch has to be removed too often. (It usually gets a little when she washes her hands.) Then there is a long period of waiting for the band to dry out when she can't use the watch. The alternative is to remove the watch whenever there is a chance that it will get wet some how and that can be time consuming and runs the risk of her losing it if she places it somewhere at school, in a public bathroom etc...2. The material of the wrist band itches her skin around her wrists if she wears it even slightly damp."
4,Very cute,"I bought this watch for my niece, she loved it! It was a great find and not very expensive for a child's first watch. The band is not the greatest (attaches with velcro), and the words that help the child tell time are very, very small (even for a child's eyes). However, in spite of these shortcomings I would still recommend the purchase of this watch."
3,fitting for a child - a teenager maybe,I bought this watch for my 7 year old niece but when I got it I did not like the size of it. This watch is actually larger than I would ever wear so I don't think this is fitting for a child - a teenager maybe.
3,timex watch,"The watch was not easy for a 12 year old girl to set and to handle. However, she liked the design."
3,Timex Children's Indiglo Watch,"It was much harder to read the print on the hands than I expected, but the indiglo is neat and was packaged well."
4,Nice little watch,My little girl love this piece so much. It will only be perfect if it comes with addition strap for interchangeable.
4,kid cool,as well.i like the look of the watch but only 4 stars because my 6 year old niece has to put in her review
1,moisture failure,Totally disappointed with this watch for my daughter. Was her 9th birthday present. She had been super excited about having her own watch and being able to take it to swim lessons. failed after 6 weeks. unfortunately it costs $8 to send it back to timex for warranty! That is lame customer service.
2,Stay Away from the Water,"It is an okay watch for kids but it became water damaged and stopped working after being taken in the tub, although it is supposed to be water resistant."
2,"Cute Watch, scratches too easily, too much packaging waste","The Watch has good build quality and decent styling and girls like it. BUT:The face is plastic and is nearly unreadable after 1 week's wearing! I think the band is slippery enough that the faces ends up on the bottom of her wrist and gets all scratched up at the playground and the art table. Not what we expected.The packaging is abominable. The cardboard exterior touts ""This package was designed and produced by times to reduce environmental impact for future generations."" HA! The interior plastic packaging has no recycling information anywhere. Future generations are supposed to mine the landfill for it, I guess.I'd rate it a 1-star, but I always feel like those people are just mad. I'm just disappointed at buying another product off Amazon that I'd never purchase if I touched it in a store."
1,dead battery,arrived with a dead battery. granddaughter can not use the watch until we get her a new one. she lives quite a distance from us and so it may be a while. she is very sad.
3,Nice but not so sexy!,"This one I bought before, but it did not have same efect than the other watch. My girfriend is pretty picky (12 old). And well see needs special stuff..."
5,Wonderful watch!,The watch was a BIG hit with my grand daughter! She loves the colors and it's helping her to learn to tell time!
5,My daughter loves this watch!!!,"I got this for my daughter for her 7th birthday and she was so excited. She has worn it everyday since receiving it. The watch fits her perfectly, with plenty of room to grow. It also has a light, which she loves."
4,Timex Kids Watch,It came timely but the band slips and I had to take a stitch so it did not keep getting bigger and bigger for my granddaughter. She loves telling us what time it is.
5,childs watch,for my daughter. Her first 'real' watch. It's a miracle we can get her to take it off :) The nice part is that the hands are distinct and face is split in two.
4,Great Watch For Kids. Could Use Larger Digits,This is a great watch to give as a child's first as it truly does help tell the time. The only issues I had with this is that the face and therefore digits could be a bit bigger to make it easier to read. Overall great watch and fantastic purchase from Amazon.
5,awesome watch,"Great watch for my 8 year old, bought this for christmas and she loves it, it reaaly helps her with telling time, quality is great"
5,Nice watch for young n old,Pretty watch for the toddler. Bought this watch for my girl but found that it looks great on me too!! Yet to give it to my girl. Maybe I will buy another piece for her and keep this for myself.
5,Great watch,"I bought this watch for my granddaughter. She was having trouble learning to tell time. She loved it.However the band is not as great as I would like it to be. It will have to be replaced in the fairly near future, because it does not have a way to ""buckle"" it where it doesn't loosen up.She loves it, so I don't regret buying it.I did however find the same identical watch about a week later at Walmart for same price. Could have saved myself some shipping had I known.And of course, it's a Timex, so It should be able to withstand the beating it is gonna have to go through, from this child."
4,I like it,'''' ''' '''''' '''''' '''''' ''''' '''' '''''' ''''' ''''''' '''' '''''' '' ''''' '' ''''' '''' '''' ''''''''''' '' '''' '' '''''' '''''' '' ''''''' ''' '''''
1,Doesn't work well with iPad 3,"I bought this because I was looking for a case to protect the front and back of my iPad 3. It does do that, but the fit is off. The iPad will slip around in the case and the controls end up misaligned with the opening. The magnets in the lid do not activate the on/off functionality of the device. Keep looking, this is not the case you want."
4,Love it,"This bracelet is the perfect size to make it look real. The clasp even has diamond cz's on it. I saw the same piece in Mazatlan for $85.00 US, I was thrilled to find it at a reasonable price point.The color is very close to my real tanzanite pieces and it looks vintage."
4,Delicious!,"My family used to be in the candy business when I was a kid growing up, and my dad's favorite was always chic-o-sticks. The preference definitely wore off on me. These are great - the bin is a good size and will last a while. I docked it a star only because there is a slight difference between the ""original"" version and this version in that the coconut and peanut butter is inside the orange shell instead of the toasted coconut flakes being on the outside. In the end it tastes the same, so I'm satisfied!"
4,Death of a Guru Book review,This is a very good book! I was very touched and amazed how the author describes his experiences vividly and informatively. This book depicts the author's familiarity with Hinduism and his conversion to Christianity. It opens your understanding of other religious cultures because it is not a textual presentation of Christianity and Hinduism but a true testimony of Mr. Maharaj's search for the truth.Highly recommended especially for people searching for the truth behind Hinduism and Christianity.
4,Very Enlightening,This is a book for those who are willing to see the truth behind the mystic. Someone pays the price for their ascention. A good read for anyone not born in India but curious about their culture.
5,Another example of Amazing Grace,Stumbled acrosss this book about 20 years ago and couldn't put it down. Shared it with several Christian friends who also raved about it. Can't recommend it highly enough.
1,A fairy tale at best.,"Just too many questionable annecdotes that have little if anything to do with Hinduism. Even things claimed as fact are dubious at best if not downright dishonest. The author has no grasp of Hinduism. He grew up in Trinidad, not exactly the hot bed of Hindu culture. Save a tree, don't buy this book. I gave it one star since I could not give it zero stars."
4,A Hindu priest finds the emptiness of his religion,"Maharaj explains his disillusionment with his religion, Hinduism. Having first hand experience from growing up from a long line of Brahmin priests, Maharaj illustrates the emptiness and vanity of Hinduism. After reaching the depths of self and realizing that he was not God after all (the ultimate goal of Hinduism), he found that peace and joy comes only through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ"
1,A Compelling Read,"I could not stop reading this book. It was very compelling and moving. It is a story of what is really behind the many practices of Hindu teaching and those in the New Age today. Many people don't know what they're getting into when they get deep into yogic meditation and deeper states of consciousness. Fortunately, Rabi continued to search for God and found him at last through Jesus.This is a must read!"
2,So So Stories,"After reading this collection I find it unremarkable and possibly forgettable. Yet, there were a couple of memorable stories--mainly memorable because of some humorous angle, not due to great plots or character development. I will easily remember the ""super""-villain with springs on his shoes--The Leap Frog; simply goofy, but taken quite seriously by DD. And then there's Stilt Man--an interesting image, but still not an interesting character."
2,"OK for an overall view, but only marginally helpful for test","I gave 2 stars because this book has some good points and good explanations. However, it is nowhere near comprehensive enough for the exam. I knew all the key points and could answer the questions, but during the test, this book, along with IIS for Dummies and Transcenders, left me knowing I used the wrong study materials."
4,The perfect review tool,"This book was the only book I needed to review for exam 70-087. I had previously failed the exam using other study materials. After using studying this book, my score incresed from a 670 to a 818!"
5,Joe Friday lives!,"If you want just the facts (like on Dragnet), you want this book. If you want a 9-inch tome, check out some of the others --- but by the time you get done reading them, IIS 5 will be out and this test will be history."
2,IIS,This book is a fast track to nowhere. I bought this book on the strength of the reviews. I was very disappointed. This book is very short on details. The information which is contained in the book can easily be obtained from the net. Save your money and don't buy this book. I passed the IIS exam and this book was of no help.
4,"This isn't bad, but don't use it by itself...","This book did a good job of giving an overview of topics covered on the exam. It's hard to believe that other reviewers could pass this exam on the strength of only this book. The format of the book is a little choppy, but the content is more thorough than any other ""cram"" type book out there. I think they went a little overboard on the scripting aspects of IIS. It's good for the real world, but the exam won't get so detailed. Buy this book and read it right before the exam is my recommendation."
5,One of the best fast track series,"It is also a good book for revision before taking the exam.It contains enough materials for you to pass the exam. If you have hand-on experience of working on IIS, I think you can simply buy this book for your preparation. In its content, there are many figures to illustrate the steps, so that it can help you to deal with those simulation questions."
5,If used with a more complete book this book is great.,"I find this book really good, as every fast track I have read. I used this book along with Microsoft press own book wich I used when I learned the product. The fast track book helps focusing on the important stuff and also have everuthing that the microsoft press book doesent have. I have also found that its great to use in class for students along with the microsoft running series. You go thrue the running book first then use fast track at the end to give them the edge they need to pass."
5,"Expensive, but worth it","Yes these are way more expensive than the cheapie pads. We ordered several brands and found that you get what you pay for. These absorb more than twice as much fluid, absorb it faster, and leave a dry surface very soon afterwards. There's only one pad on the market that outperformed these--and of course, it is nearly 50% higher in price, too!Overall? A really great pad, not as expensive as it seems, because you need to change them so much less!"
5,No odor!,Amazon continues to be the best place to shop for everything! These are the best pads for my two small dogs. They do not leak and the urine odor is contained. These are far better than the training pads we have purchased at stores.
3,Price increased after being out of stock,This item was out of stock for a while and now is available with a 40% increase in the price.. I could get the same product off the shelf from the grocery store at a much lower price.
2,You get what you pay for,"These were cheaper pads, and that being said, you get what you pay for. They come folded up in a quarter of their actual size. On half of them when I went to unfold (no matter how gently and slow I did it) the plastic backing ripped. This, of course, defeated the purpose of the pad because my dog's urine ended up getting on the floor. The ones that actually didn't rip when I unfolded them worked fine. They're pretty absorbent and they are pretty much odor free like the packaging suggests. That said, I won't be buying these again as I don't like the fact that half of them ripped."
3,A bit too thin for my Chihuahua,"Her urine rapidly spreads across the pad and onto her feet. I've used pads that did a better job of catching the urine and keeping her clean, but those were from Japan and I don't know how to get them here.Occasionally the borders cannot contain the fluid properly, and the floor will get wet.I toss them after one use.If I didn't know how good pads can be, I might feel better about these, but these are definitely not the best."
1,The WORST Pads I Have Ever Used!!!!,I tried the Hartz pads because they were considerably cheaper than the brand I usually buy (Nature's Miracle). There is NO comparison to the absorpency of the two products. The Hartz pads leak through and I found myself washing the floor and changing pads every couple of hours. Not such a bargain after all.
2,Give Us A Break -We don't ask for much,"I had been buying this pad but no more. You have just outpriced yourself by raising the price from $9.99 to $15.21 even with the 4 for 3 discount and the free shipping(that's why the two stars). They are cheaper at Walgreens where they still sell for $9.99. You can lower the price in consideration of your customers,I'll buy them again. In the meantime, if you want a pretty good pad I've used the ones from DHMEDICAL online where they have 200 pads for $30 and reasonable shipping. Zero Stars for Amazon. five stars for the Hartz quality."
2,Rip easily and don't hold much pee!,"I use pee pads in the house only when no one is home or overnight.I work from home, so 90% of the time I am home and available to let our chihuahua out to use the bathroom.I have noticed that she will pee once, and sometimes twice overnight and the pad doesnt hold the pee all of the time. The other pads I have used have never had this issue.Also, when I pulled the pads out of the bag, sometimes the corners of the pad would be stuck folded into the middle of the pad and when I would pull it apart the pad would rip and I would have cotton coming out from the pad..So, after trying these pads for about 5 days... I gave up on these."
5,favorite potty pans,"These potty pads are great! The best on the market, except for the Hartz 12-hour potty pads. I can't get them in my city of 50,000+ people except at a large drug-store chain, which charges almost 30% more than I can get through Amazon (including shipping!). Our city has 2 large pet care chains: PetCo and Pet Supermarket and they aren't interested in carrying these potty pads, which is a shame because they sell out at the local drug store as soon as they arrive.Thank you Amazon for putting me in touch with someone who will send me these products at an affordable price!"
2,Latest version of Hartz pads stinks of chemicals,"I have been using Hartz puppy pads since we got adopted my dog last fall and I've been ordering them from Amazon. However the latest shipment (June 2011) is different than the previous product. I noticed when the shipment arrived last week that the outer wrapping had changed (as reflected in the new photo amazon posted)- I've since read companies usually do this when they change their product manufacturers or formulations. When I opened the bag, a terrible chemical odor was immediately evident. The smell has completely filled the coat closet where we keep the pads. It is also making the bathroom where the dog pees smell toxic. The dog himself doesn't seem to mind the acrid smell, but we sure do. I think we're going to try theseWare River Pet Puppy Wee Wee Pads 23""x24"" 100/box USA MADEbecause at least they're made in the USA, although there isn't free shipping. I don't want to poison my family or my dog."
4,Best value on amazon!,"These puppy pads are great. My pup took to them immediately and uses them regularly. Because I have a small dog with small messes, she can use these a few times on different parts of the pad before I actually have to throw it away. The only reason I gave this a 4 rating is because they aren't biodegradable, which environmentally I would prefer. But this is probably the best value I've seen on the internet AND in stores! But I suggest stocking up when you order, because they're might take awhile to arrive...currently 4 to 6 weeks to ship!!!"
4,Great value pads,"These pads are great. Not as absorbing as the ones I use that specific eliminate tracking, but for the price, it gets the job done. I would recommend this if you are looking for a cheaper alternative."
5,GREAT! too bad the price went up...,"I am always looking for a good deal so when I saw the 50ct pack for $9.99 with the 4 for 3 discount, I knew it was a steal!They are super absorbent and I've tested many! They are a great size and the odor doesn't seem to linger as long with these pads as compared to others.I would continue to buy if the price were to stay the same as when I bought them but now with the price change, I think I will be looking for another brand despite my great review of the product."
5,Puppy Pads - I have tried many of them,I'm very pleased with these puppy pads. My dog is an indoor pet as a result he needs access to these pads 24hrs a day. I have tried many other pads with mixed results. These are consistant and they do the job! I purchase a two month supply at a time so I don't run out. And finally you can't beat the price!
1,Really wanted to like it,"The book is really a over simplification of everything we go through as Muslim women living in the West. The author's main character is a personification of every Western stereotype of Sudan (specifically) and Muslim women (generally).As a reader , I was waiting for that aha moment with every page I turned. I picked it up of because of the lavish praise it had garnered. But it failed me miserably. Rarely , do I give my books away... I did with this one."
3,"Moving and enoyable, but sometimes hard to follow","The story is about a Muslim widow falling in love with a Scottish expert on the Middle East, and her struggle between her faith and her love for him. The subject is very interesting and I enjoyed the poetic phrases. The ending was a bit different than I expected, in a nice way.But I found the book a little difficult to parse. It often jumped between past, present and dreams with me struggling to figure out which it was, and some of the important scenes took place without actual dialogue - it would say something like 'he said x and then she said y and then something happened'.I also found myself wondering a lot about the other characters. I think the book could've been longer and a bit more linear, and I would've enjoyed it much more. It was a bit of a struggle to finish it but I'm glad I did."
1,do not buy,"I used this book for a Latin Composition independent study in the Fall of '05. I was very disappointed. The excercises vary from rediculously tedious to extremely confusing. The professor was always at a loss as to the intentions of the authors, and we were only able to thoroughly cover the first 9 chapters of the book in one semester.It slowly become clear that to properly complete the lessons, we were expected to obtain all three of the suggested grammars (all of which are published by Focus). Furthermore, my edition of the book began coming unglued from the binding no less than 3 weeks into the semester.I would not reccomend it for any class except one taught by Mr. Tunberg and Ms. Minkova themselves. The book is obviously the product of their own very subjective teaching style (or a cheap attempt to bolster their list of published works and make a few bucks at the same time)."
5,We Want More!,Appaloosa Pete and the Band of Wiley Wolves was a joy to read. The illustrations and story were like a book I would have liked to write and is finally done!The best part of reading about Appaloosa Pete was when the ending left me feeling that there would be more to come!My kindergarden class will enjoy writing thank you letters to Jessica for such a fun heroe!
4,Cute little kids book.,"I actually found this on accident a year ago, and bought it. It was kinda cute. I think that we need to support more ""small"" publishers. The stories are just as good! This is a great little book. Your child(ren) will love this book!"
1,Ocarian Cancer bracelet,"I bought it for the cause, however, came apart in pieces within a couple of hours. Other friends who ordered theirs came apart also."
4,Great bracelet,"I love this bracelet. It's very pretty & looks just like it was shown. Looks expensive & tasteful. I have bigger wrists, so I'd like it better if it came in larger sizes..but it goes great with my watch."
5,Wonderful Bracelet/Wonderful Cause,This bracelet is very nice and the donation is for a great cause....It came like a true gift would be presented and I am very happy with it.
4,Very Pleased,"The product arrived in a very timely manner, even during the holiday rush. For the money, I'm quite pleased and would recommend this product simply for the joy of knowing that part of the proceeds is being used for research that arrests many of the women in our lives."
5,"Pave ""O"" Bracelet",This beautiful bracelet arrived on time and in perfect condition. The bracelet itself is the perfect size for an average woman's wrist. I purchased it for my daughter who has a small bone structure but it rests perfectly on her wrist and did not need to be sized. I was originally concerned that it might fall off easily but it has a sturdy toggle design and that has not been a problem. This bracelet is also offered at a reasonable price point--I may buy one for myself.
5,"Finally - A High Quality, Practical Tool!","My husband and I can dance together ... if we hire a professional choreographer. We've tried dance lessons-group and private - and have also rented other videos, but they were poor quality and / or showed guys in spandex and shirts tied at the waist. I just wanted to dance and have fun and pretend to be Ginger Rogers, and my husband did not want to be Fred Astaire, he just wanted to avoid calling attention to himself, so he had a hard time relating to those teaching methods! Oh - and did I mention he can't lead and I can't follow, and although I am SURE I can lead, he can't follow? This system assumes we are intelligent, but is easy to figure out, is well-produced, and has dancers who look like normal people (e.g., like us only younger). Finally - the rest of us can learn to dance together without the nagging suspicion that someone thinks we're trying to prepare for the next big ballroom dancing championship."
3,Get what you pay for.,"You get what you pay for.Luckily I bought this to replace a shifter knob for an automatic, the adapter setup is pretty cheap and isn't very secure.My car is an automatic and it moves easily if you try to turn it, but for my use it works OK.I wouldn't recommend this for a manual trans, it would probably come loose/move alot.It does look great for the price tho."
3,Not as good as it looks like!,"First, it cost $11, can expect to much from that... Second, cheply made, im not so sure that is real letther.. Third, a bit tall..Over all, is good for the cost, but not great... we will see how much does it last... I will recomend to pay more to get a better product..."
5,excellent product,"the product is of excellent quality, easy to install and very comfortable to use. also brings a complete set of adapters to install in almost any vehicle, good buy."
1,Not right for a truck,"I waited to review this until I had tried it for a while. Sadly it has not lived up to my expectations. It really is too tall for the gear shift on my truck but I figured i would just live with that. The real problem is the way it connects to the shifter -- not nearly secure enough because of the little allen screws it uses, so it is always loose feeling. And today the whole think fell apart -- seperated where the knob attaches to the threaded piece that goes on the shifter. Might work on an automatic -- definately no good for a manual shift!"
4,You Get What You Pay For,You really get what you pay for. It isn't the highest quality product but since it was cheap I cant complain.
1,Junk,Made of very poor quality white metal it broke while installing it. Still have not got a refund. My advice is DO NOT purchase this item.
1,Not Worth It,"When I first got it, I thought...it's not as nice as it is in pictures but after recalling the price, it was ok. I installed it according to the instructions and found that it came loose after only a couple minutes of driving it. I took the bottom part of the knob off and it stayed a little better. Now, after having it a week, it comes loose every time I drive it and a piece of the top layer has already peeled off. I am already shopping for a different one."
4,Very funny stuff,"Dilbert knows office humor and this book is a compilation, by topic, of some of Adams' best work over a 10 year period. I love Dilbert, so this book is a lot of fun.However, I will warn you - having the strips arranged by topic takes some of the humor out of it - a whole section of strips dedicated to ""Secretaries"" for instance, is not nearly as funny as just seeing an occasional barb. Can you imagine Seinfeld doing his comedy routine by subject? ""Ok, here are all my jokes about women"", now onto ""cookies"" - no, it just doesn't work as well. I prefer the straight timeline accumulations. And you will find yourself rereading strips you have seen in other Dilbert books too.But overall, a fine collection - I still think it's great - it just could be better."
2,"Save Your Money, Buy It for $1.00, Or Less","Good for about ten brilliant, classic Dilbert cartoons - and not much else.When are these pinheads going to get into their pinheads that if you satirize other people, your standards are supposed to be higher? A pulp candidate, after the classics are extracted by the single-edged razor blade."
1,I find myself becoming angry...,"You know, I used to really enjoy Dilbert, and still do to some extent, but lately I find myself more and more disgusted with the way Scott Adams is willing to whore out his creation to absolutely ANYONE if the price is right. Case in point: this book. It contains absolutely NOTHING new. It is nothing more than yet another shameless cash-in that nobody should even consider purchasing."
2,reflective glare screen?,I need a glare screen because of windows behind me. I found that this glare screen was MORE reflective than my display was by itself. Useless.
2,JUST KEEP TAKING PICTURES,"Jonathan (Michael Zara) has nothing better to do on Halloween night than carve pumpkins. Alec (David J. Wright) is Lyn's (Amy Weber) douche-bag boyfriend who puts on a mask and scares Lyn. Jonathan, believing she is actually being attacked kills her boyfriend. A year later they go to a Halloween party out in a field with a bunch of Lyn's friends, none of which we get to know other than by their 2006 costumes.Jonathan is having flash backs and sees weird things associated with Alec in his pumpkin mask. There is an old creepy pumpkin carver (Terrence Evans) who mentions other carvers. Jonathan gets kicked around by a steroid pumped ex-boyfriend of a girl, who his sister is attempting to fix him up with (nice going sis).The characters have some colorful moments, but they are far from funny. The lack of character build up and suspects turns this who-dun-it slasher film into a lame 2 star attempt.F-bomb, near sex, no nudity in spite of what the rating box tells you."
3,Halloween Spookiness,"OK, this wasn't a 100% fantastic movie but I enjoy Halloween based horror movies/slashers and this was actually pretty good. It had a decent amount of action and the cinematography wasn't bad AT ALL. It had fair acting and some very different style kills. The ending was a little odd but I find myself saying that about a lot of films nowadays. I think this would make a good movie for a rainy weekend night, especially Halloween night ;). I'd also like to add, this is NOT one of those homemade quality movie. I've seen so many of those floating around lately, I am SO SICK of it. I guess that's what made this film a bit more refreshing, it was good quality rather than that grainy, shakey, homemade movie style. Enjoy!"
1,it's the uncarvable pumpkin Charlie Brown,"I've never seen a movie this bad, lol.This is one terrible film. It's not scary, it's not intereting, it's not *anything*. It's just bland, boring, generic, typical, low budget horror storytelling. From beginning to end, horrendous acting and forgettable.The entire story was pointless to me. A bunch of teens go to some desert, party the night away, have pointless pumpkin carving tournaments, develop romantic relationships with each other, walk around all night doing nothing noteworthy, etc. BAD MOVIE.So is the movie scary? haha, don't make me laugh. The only thing scary is how someone out there thought this junk was good enough to be released. I DID think the one female actress walking around wearing a hat was super hot, but that's not enough to save a film that makes pumpkins cry."
1,A Bad Movie,"If you like watching young adults having sex, this is the film for you. Honestly, it was so bad I turned it off. No plot, no reason why the young man is ""haunted"" by an unknown pumpkin creature/man, no background is given on the pumpkin creature/man, unless of course it comes later in the movie ... don't bother adding this movie to your collection ... it's not worth a second watch."
2,This is not what you think it is.,I bought these thinking that they were the front shocks like they have in the picture but they are not. Their picture is wrong.
5,The Most Beautiful Christian Music I have ever heard,I have been a classical music student for 15 years and now work as a volunteer music director for my Parish. While searching for some resources I came across this album and it blew me away. The rich tones and harmonies create and indescribable inner peace. This is what Church music should be-Holy. I recommed this album without reserve.
1,"Too expensive, book falls apart - literally!","This book does not deliver for the price. Although the title postures as being a comprehensive reference work for ancient warfare, it falls short.It skips several of the major battles of both Greek and Roman history. I assume it does not include every battle from the Egypt and the Near East.As has been pointed out by several reviews the quality of this book and the paper quality remind of the old ""see Spot run."" books I read as a first grader (age6-7).For any semi-serious student, consider the new cambridge series. The quality of scholarship far surpasses what is found here, and the book will last for more than one week.This book should cost about $50.00 and should have a warning label that the materials the book is made from are of extremely poor quality."
3,BMW interior... Yugo chassis...,"I am enjoying this book and it is of great use to my graduate studies in Ancient History. The citations are wonderful.However, the manufacturing quality of the book is terrible. I left the book open on my desk overnight and the binding has given way, freeing a section of over 250 pages. Upon examination, I find the binding glue to be extremely brittle and opening the book flat is enough to crack the spine.Greenwood Press should be ashamed."
2,Not the definitive work,"While an interesting work and worth reading, it is not nearly the biography that Blair Jackson's ""Garcia"" is. Many aspects of Jerry's life are somewhat polished up it seems. Not that gory expose is desirable, but still I was left feeling that perhaps the book had a censored feel to it. This is just an opinion. Read Jackson's book, then ""Dark Star"", for a much more complete and well rounded view of Jerry's life."
2,Cursory and inadequate,"I was going to recommend this to those just mildly curious about Jerry Garcia, but on second thought I can't do that. It is an inadequate look at a profoundly complex man, done in a style that, once you have read better work, you realize leaves big wedges of the pie out. Blair Jackson's biography is THE definitive work, of course, but I would also read Dark Star and even the hilarious (but occasionally innacurate) Living with the Dead by Rock Scully ahead of this. Jerry would have hated the name, too: Captain Trips...he despised all that psychadelic pop icon schmaltz, including the skulls and the Uncle Sam hat. He just wanted to play guitar, which may in the end be his most eloquent and lasting testament to all of us."
4,Cherry Garcia,"I really enjoied reading this book. I liked how it was about both Jerry and the Dead and how Troy wrote about how Jerry got exposed to all those different styles or music that got reflected in his music. I would say that it is a must read for any Dead-Head, old or new."
1,Insanely scary book,"Because George Bush has just announced his plan to select Dr. W. David Hager to head up the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee, I felt impelled to read his books. Hager's track record of using religious beliefs to guide his medical decision-making makes him a dangerous and inappropriate candidate to serve as chair of the above-mentioned committee. It seems that Hager's solution to stress is for women to quit work, to resume their ""natural"" rhythms as ""home economists."" Shades of a Handmaid's Tale and other dystopian visions of theocratic societies that want to put women back in their ""place."" Dr. Hager is a practicing OB/GYN who refuses to prescribe contraceptives to unmarried women. Hager also appears to have endorsed the medically inaccurate assertion that the common birth control pill is an abortifacient. These are scary, scary times."
1,Now that's stressful,"No, I didn't read the book. I read The Nation article about Hager's first wife. Seems she didn't like being forcefully sodomized by this jerk. More hypocrisy from the Christian Right!"
1,How sad,"While it may be true that prayer can affect a person's health positively, doctors are supposed to inform women about ALL their options (including birth control and abortion). While he is only one member of the FDA Committee, and is entitled to his opinion, it is sad that he feels he has the right to impose his views on others! Where is the separation between church and medicine?"
1,We Need Seperation of Church and State,"This ""doctor"" doesn't like perscribing contraceptives to unmarried women, but doesn't approve of abortions either.He encourages prayer to cure PMS. It would be funny if he wasn't a Bush appointee."
1,What a scary time we live in.,"Can you believe that the author of this book is being appointed by bush to head up the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee? How's that for another underhanded way that Bush is trying to control women and their bodies..... that and the so-called protective ""Laci Peterson Law!"
4,hot and sexy,"THIS IS A GREAT CD. THE LADY REALLY LAYS IT DOWN,SHE HAS A REAL NICE VOICE AND THE LYRICS ARE TIGHT.IF YOU LIKE REAL MUSIC ORDER THIS HIT CD,YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID."
4,tester de injectores,"Es un buen equipo para realizar el balance de injectores, esto quiere decir que se puede probar la efectividad de cada injector por separado. Ademas de este equipo, se debe tener para la prueba un medidor de presion de gasolina, claro teniendo en cuenta que la bomba del vehículo esté en buen estado y no retorne la presion."
4,"It was very informative, and nicely done...","There were many different things that they talked about in this book, all regarding the drawing of 'deformed characters'. I found all that I needed to in this book, although there were some things (like some little 'in the nude' drawings) that made me lose some focus..."
4,Cute and helpful.,"This book goes over the basic stuff like how to do the head,the basics of the body,expressions, the difference between a regular manga charater and a chibi(nother word for Super Deformed charater)ect. Then it goes over the details like making fat people, skinny people, how and when to use chibis in comics,so on. It was a great book besides the fact there were a few naked chibis here and there (thats why I gave it four stars) but still worth buying!~*~Purin~*~"
4,"stereo version of people's ""i love you""","i give this disc 4 stars for the fact that it contains the hard to find track "" i love you "" by people, in stereo. this is the only stereo version i've been able to find without a big expensive hassle. all songs except track 9 are stereo."
5,Works great if you use it as intended,"Get very bright vibrant and glossy printouts on this paper using my HP designjet large format printer. I use it for printing banners, GIS maps, and photos."
3,hp gloss banner for acrylic paints,"I bought this material for painting with acrylic paint. The paint does not adhere to the material, and I have been able to peal the paint off. Any Ideas what might work better?"
4,Nostradamus Stays on the Scene,Sex and the City has nothin' on this fun rendition of Nostradamus' life and lustiness.
5,Much Needed,"This book should be handed out to all young ladies in a church. It's principles and truths need to be reintroduced into our society. I am afraid our young ladies are more influenced by the culture than the Scriptures. This book will help them in most areas of life. My wife thoroughly enjoyed it, although there are some tough chapters (such as the one on novel reading). Also, the introduction is good for men as well as ladies."
1,Young Ladies Guide to Harmonious Development of Christian Character,Get this book if you want your daughters to become Stepford-like nuts. Good grief.
2,Not worth the price!,"I missed the number of pages on this book. It has about 4 pages of stickers total which doesn't seem to justify it being a ""book""??? Stickers are good quality, but not worth the price."
2,Star Wars Sticker Book,"This Sticker book was well received by my Great, Great Nephew, but I didn't think it was big enough to be worth the price."
4,Frank & Louie's Greatest Hits,...I bought this CD for the lizards; not the music. The music is great; but Frank and Louie are the real attraction...I don't even like beer. I hope the company which produced these commercials will put out a video of all of them; beginning with the frogs right through to the ferret. I would have given it 5 stars if it had been all lizards and no music. But it's great fun; well worth it.
4,Diggity dog,"My grandson loves this game, he has really learned to listen to the number of barks and pay close attention to the color of the bones...a great beginning toward learning."
5,Enjoyable game for the whole family!,This game was bought for our 3 year old. It is a fun simple game that he can follow and yet my 6 year old will want to play. It is great for listening skills because you have to listen to the number of barks. It also works on hand/eye coordination and dexterity because you have to put your dog's nose on the little bone. You can't go wrong with this game!
4,Great toy!,Child liked it. Easy to operate and help child become famaliar with it. Wpould recommend the toy to other parents.
1,No damn bones,"Bought a brand new game and it did not have the bones that you need to play. How wonderful to watch my daughter cry when she could not play the game. As my 3 year old said, ""that sucks!"""
3,disappointed with scale size,"The model itself is fine. Good quality Maisto. But I think it's ""MISLEADING"" when you're searching under 1:18 scale larger models and one like this which is about onlu 1:32 scale pops up for sale with NO MENTION of the scale size. I could have bought a much larger 1:18 of the same model for the same price. But I will keep it. Not worth the hassle. BUT - I'll never buy from this seller again. Done!"
1,full of errors,"Used for an advanced osteology course. This book is full of errors, which is unacceptable in a second addition. It seems like the author tried to cram several texts into one, as it is quite small for the amount of information that it TRIES to include (development and pathology in addition to structure and function). At only 380 pages, 7.5 X 9 inches, it should be an introduction to the human skeleton, not an all-inclusive text on the skeletal system, development, and pathology. I'd recommend buying other texts, even though they may be more expensive."
2,Slow and tedious,"This book was used for an oseteology class that I was in. Most of the time reading it was slow to the point that following it was extremely difficult. As an aid you might want to have a professional forensic anhropologist, a medical dictionary and another osteology book to translate what you're reading line by line. There's alot of information packed in it, but desiphering it is difficult."
3,Average universal remote,"I was looking a remote replacement for my RCA F19426 19"" TV so the universal remote feature wasn't too important. However I have tested and it is average, you will end up using the original remote because some functions doesn't work well."
3,Doesn't fit my gun,This holster came on time and was offered at a great price but doesn't fit my gun. I bought it for a Sig Pro 2340 as it said it would fit a Sig Pro but evidently I didn't read the fine print or something.
2,dreadful ghost of her former self,"What happened to the wonderful stories intertwined with history that Susan Johnson is known for writing? I am extremely disappointed in this book. I purchased it because several people had stated in their reviews that this was a return to her former writing. Alas, it is not. The story is disappointing and should not be connected to her former stories of Hazard, Trey and Daisy. There is a distinct lack of plot, I was not able to connect with the characters. Hazard and Blaze were not the same strong personalities as in the former books. I think that this will be the last book by Susan Johnson that I purchase. It is sad to see an author of her talent publish this book."
5,Force of Nature,"Susan Johnson never disappoints. Even thoufh storylines are similar, I like the research that goes into countries of settings for stories. Makes for very educational and interesting reading."
3,What a force!,"You cant help but fall in love with these main characters! Jo is headstrong and confident, and has the wits to challenge any man. Flynn Ito is a half-blood man, used to being on the fringe of society...at least, the society of out-of-the-way ranchers. Being half Japanese has made him hard and distant from letting women get too close. He has had to prove his worth and defend his name and honor too many times to be fooled with. He is not a man to cross or get on his bad side. But in the brothels, Flynn is truly wanted. Jo has the misfortune of being in his way one evening. When their paths cross, it is instant fire! This is not your typical steamy romance. Jo goes after Flynn and tells him like it is. She becomes a captive, and when Flynn rescues her, it is such a realistic scenario, again not typical. Not your typical weepy-eyed, helpless female. She proves she is strong on so many levels.Those two were just meant for each other!"
2,Get the Quilted Flannel,"I accidentally ordered the thermal lined instead of the quilted flannel, and there is no comparison! The quilted flannel fits better, is warmer, and just generally a better coat. Do not get the thermal!"
4,Coat,Nice coat appears well made but kind of stiffGood deal don't know if it keep you warm enuf with this cold New England weather
2,Quality was not what I expected,"This jacket, being a Carhartt, was a big disappointment. Quality just wasn't there. The zipper was almost impossible to run. I returned this item."
5,"""WORKS"" FOR ME",I like the weight and fit of this jacket. Super tough. This is my 3rd and they hold up better than anything i know of. Zippers don't seem to work as smooth as they used to.
3,Carhartt Men's Thermal Lined Duck Active Jacket,"The coat is nice, however I thought it would be heavier than it is. The thermal lining is very thin."
5,My bf LOVED it!,"It was so big and perfect for him! Wasnt as stiff as everyone said and he says it keeps him so warm without over heating. He also says its nice when working on cars and other projects cause he doesnt have to worry about ruining it, its SO tough! And it looks great on him:) Will last him years and years!"
2,TOO STIFF!,"The material is rugged as offered, but too stiff in the feel for my comfort. The zipper was sticking. The brown is really like a deep burnt orange.I reordered the same jacket in the sandstone finish in moss color. I found it to be softer and very comfortable."
4,Medium size is quite big,"I'm 5""7 and the medium jacket runs a little big for me. Still not going to return it though. The jacket looks great, is probably indestructible and should be very warm."
5,NICE,Plenty warm and water resistant. Perfect for outdoor events and construction jobs. The tall size is perfect for tall guys like me. Keeps your back warm!
5,Exactly,"This jacket is just what I wanted, its warmer enough for cold winter Chicago days but not bulky and restrictive."
5,Better than Great!!,I bought this jacket for my son-in-law. He is a crane operator and he works outdoors in the worst weather conditions. I was thrilled when my son-in-law opened this gift and tried it on. It runs true to size and it is so incredibly warm! I would definitely shop with this seller again. Delivery was fast and this jacket was packaged beautifully! I would reccomend this item and this seller again and again!
3,Needs to have an actual warm lining,I thought this jacket was going to have a warmer inside lining. The outside is durable typical Carhartt fashion :) I bought it for my husband for Christmas he still needs to wear another jacket under this one tho for warmth. :( kinda defeats the purpose of buying him a new jacket :/
5,Great product,Purchaced as a gift. Son reports it is warm and flexable enough to wear when driving. Said it is the best coat he has ever had.
4,warm,Was bigger than expected but that's good since it was for someone who works out side in construction gives him room to move. It's warm don't need to layer up too much.
4,Great Medium-Weight Outdoor Work Jacket,Meets the need for outdoor work jacket with medium weight and durability. Interior pockets are a nice feature and the bottom band of the jacket it keeps it from riding up. Hood is nice for windy or cold days.
5,"Rugged, Durable.",Nice and roomy. Good for fall temps. Can add layers for harsh weather without feeling bulky.Good price and Great purchase.
4,Exactly what I expected,It is exactly what I wanted and the quality and craftmanship leave nothing to be desired. I would recommend to anyone.
3,"A review from a ""big"" guy","I'm a big guy (weight not height) and really wanted to buy a new all weather coat. Read a lot of the reviews and they all seemed pretty good. First, the weight and the feel of the jacket make it seem like it would be really warm. This (at least for me) didn't really cut it on those colder days. Also, the fit was a bit weird. The width was good, the arm length was good, but the overall jacket length I thought could have been one or two inches longer. I kept it to try a few times thinking maybe that was just my imagination, but I never got used to it. I'll give it a few more tries when it gets a little warmer, but I have a feeling this will go into my ""never wear"" pile."
5,My brother loves it!,"""This is the best Christmas present I got this year"" is what my brother said a week after receiving this jacket. It's durable, warm, and the Tall sizing really helps for anyone over 5' 11"". Great product."
3,product not as advertised,"product is decribed as thermal lined, and it is not. is a very nice light jacket, but do not expect it to keep you warm this winter in michigan. decided to keep it anyway, but i still need to get something for ""winter"", michigan style."
4,Very durable and warm,Had to get one size smaller. Listen to reviews and get the one size down. The inner liner isn't the most gentle on the skin but decent. Jacket is tough and super durable and warm in brisk weather.
1,Not working,"The monitor does power on, but did not pump air to inflate, and all it showed just error message, no blood pressure reading at all."
1,Previous Rater,How can Dr. Bhatia say the Lumiscope monitor 1095 is reliable without providing a comparison with a manual monitor? He should know better because he is a doctor.
4,Melodic Precision Power Metal,"I bought this because a review I read said it was Power Metal played with the same ferosity as Children of Bodom.Sounded cool to me.And that is a pretty fair statement.This band is very tight and sound alot more mature than just a two album band,this being their second.Not your usual dungeons and dragons power metal,but a mixture of traditional metal like Maiden and early Queensryche and power metal like Stratovarius ands Gamma Ray.The music reminds me of Destiny era Stratovarius and the keyboards here sound exactly like Janne Warman of Children of Bodom which really gives the music great atmoshere.Just checkout the intro to Stray Bullet.The vocals are clean and powerful and the riffs are heavy.Top notch all the way really.And better than alot of bands out there that are getting more attention.All fans of Gamma Ray,Edguy,Helloween and Stratovarius will really enjoy this album."
2,"eh, not so much of a twist","though I appreciate much of Winterson's novel-length work, I was wary in beginning this colection of short fiction edited by her. It started off with several interesting and pleasant to read stories, but as a whole, offered somewhat insipid, uninsightful writing. Perhaps this because I was expecting or hoping for a driving force of surreality and otherworldly characters who carried themselves strongly and had fully developed characteristics, much like found in The Passion or Sexing the Cherry. Unfortunately, I found the collection much more like The World & Other Places or Written On The Body--without much to pull me through and keep me reading. This book, in my opinion, is only for the Winterson connisseur."
1,Amazing book,"This is a great book, however it is not worth $50.it is a complete abomination that this book is for sale on this site for so much money, when you can easily get the book FREE ON THE BOOK'S WEBSITE! look it up for yourself! its an ebook and it is completely free! i can't believe that people try to sell this book for so much money! it goes completely against what the author wanted; he wanted to make it free anyway but there was no way to publish it for free, so he put the ebook on his site.if you want this book, DON'T PAY ANYTHING FOR IT! GET THE EBOOK!"
1,Not worth the price!,"This little book is poorly made, has many misspellings and the info in this book is lacking...The book is also being marketed with another title...same bad quality, with crooked cover, for more than half the price off and is still too pricey...What is it about this book that makes it so valuable???"
4,Sometimes You Can Judge a CD By Its Cover :-),"This CD delivers what the CD implies ... a sexy collection of sophisticated pop trip hop, nu bossa nova, samba, chill, lounge and fun. A great CD for your night time - a party of 2 or 20. Nothing more needs to be said. Put on this CD, dim the lights, chill the gin & vodka ... you are go to go."
2,Be very careful using this translation,"This translation is a paraphrase at best, and contains some disturbing contradictions to other translations of the same text, including my own spot translations to check on these. While I'm not a classical scholar, some of these are fairly obvious. Also, a lot of interpolated material is not set off in any way. It is interesting to read this translation in the context of the two other main translations now available, Lianshang Wu's (which has the Chinese text, but has a poor English text which is closer to the original) and Veith's (which is more arbitrary, possibly because she had no background in TCM), but don't rely on this for clinical advice, it is spoon feeding you one man's opinion, and in this persons opinion, it isn't very good."
5,Better to buy the Holiday Spectacular !!!,"This item is set to release 11/18/2005. But also scheduled to release in October/November, 2005 are Volumes 2, 3 and the Holiday Spectacular. What isn't clear so far, is that the Holiday Spectacular IS Volumes 2, 3, and 4 in one package, according to the distributor's website: Starlight Home Entertainment. So save your money and just buy the Holiday Spectacular 3-disk set. You get 18 15-minute episodes, plus three 30-minute Holiday-themed episodes (Halloween, Christmas, New Years) for a total of 6 hours of viewing"
2,What A Difference a Few Decades Make - a review of Davey & Goliath Vol. 4,"We must have been desperate for entertainment back in the days of yore because I remember watching these videos (way back when), and I remember liking them. But now....But now... while the themes are still good, the pacing of the video is almost unbearable.Three Stars. Slooooooooow pacing makes this a poor selection for children on the go. I think the books are better."
4,Passover for Christians? Yes!,"Although this book is small, it's packed with useful information on how Christians can incorporate the Passover Meal into their own holiday traditions. Full of ideas not only on the meal itself and the symbolism but other hints and helps. The only drawback is no recipes are included-but they are easy enough to find on the Internet. Delightful book!"
5,Love them,These socks are very warm and comfortable. They fit to size and are not tight in the calf. They are quite thick so don't plan on using them with boots that are snug around the leg.
2,Too repetitive,"This would have been a decent book if the author hadn't gone on and on and on and on about the same details over and over. This is obviously a self-published book which I don't suppose I have a problem with if the author had at least hired an editor. ""common"" instead of ""C'mon"" or ""Come on"". I didn't mind the reading through the first chapter how 'classy' the lead character was and how she was very careful to not have her picture in the society columns every week so she wouldn't 'wear out her welcome' and how her friends were incredibly jealous and didn't understand stepping away from the photographer BUT it is rammed down the readers throat in every. single. paragraph. I was even more frustrated when I got to the ending? What? It leaves you hanging in mid-sentence - or someone tore the page out of the back of my copy. Not good."
5,Palate pleasing & appetite satisfying,"The collaborative effort of P.J. Gray and Stanley Hunter, Bear Cookin': The Original Guide To Bear Comfort Foods is expertly organized into six major sections: Lip Smackin' Snackin'; Woofy Breakfast; Hearty Sides; Come-And-Get-It Entrees; Bear Meat; and Beyond The Honeypot. With easy-to-follow recipes ranging from Cheese on Rye Pizzas; Hobo Hash; and Cabin Fever Soup; to Spaghetti Carbonara; Husbear Burgers; and Banana Split Cake, Bear Cookin' is a wonderful compendium of palate pleasing, appetite satisfying, kitchen cook friendly recipes."
3,great bloody lesbo schlock,"If your into low budget, campy, feminist, bloody gore you'll like this film.It may take a serious effort to get through some of the less entertaining, even dull, scenes and some really bad acting, but there are some really funny even artistic scenes that make it all worth while.pros &/or cons: excess of fake blood, incredibly bad efx, vaginal humor, some good music, intentionally and unintentionally funny dialogue"
3,"Can you say ""Poseurs""?","Ok... that was harsh. BUT, while watching Vh1 Classics yesterday, a video of this band came about. so (later on that day) I ran into this particular live disc and bought it (for about $5 used). Good CD, but I cant get the singer's face out of my mind acting like the genetic offspring of Ian Astbury of the CULT and Steven Tyler of AEROSMITH, with about 1/2 the talent of either. Best song on this little gem is 20th Century Boy, and i say gen because despite the poseur singing, its great rock and roll. The band as a whole do kick ass & the music is more than i expected. And although i call this dude a poseur, i have MUCH more respect for him than Scott Stapp or Fred Durst."
5,the best grand prix of the 10 last years,It is the best video I have ever seen. I like it very much such as I saw it more than 5 times in the first week I have in my hands the cassete.Especialy I like Ayrton Senna. He drives very well.
3,Worth it,"It's a bulky controller that comes with a CD for drivers, and installs Gamepad software that uses up about 5,000 K of RAM. The grips and built in fan are nice, but it's quite big and the buttons sometimes get stuck/require heavy pressing."
3,"Never liked that ""fan your hands"" idea.","Wireless I guess has some reason to exist, and Turbo was always nice, but I never jumped on the ""fan your hands"" bandwagon. It just seemed like a dumb idea, gadgetizing the controller way too much. Though I do like the design of this pad. Very nice ""cross"" d-pad unlike the stock ""4 slivers of hard plastic"" the standard PS1&2 pads give you. Its got rubber grips, so it probably has more ruggedness than the common flimsy PC gamepad. But if you really want console ruggedness on your PC, just go get an adapter from Lik-Sang and Joy2Key software, then you can use any PS1 or 2 pad you've got lying in your closet as a PC device and you'll have the ability to map it to keyboard and mouse."
2,Solid and easy to set up however...,No diagonal on the direction pad or the sticks. That's a big problem.
4,Excellent choice for gamepad,"I have been using this gamepad for months and the fan still works as good as it ever did. I love the feel of the grips and the button responsiveness. If I had to improve something, I would make the D-pad a little softer to the touch and easier on the thumbs. I've heard of them sticking a little, but I've never had a problem with it. The analogs are fantastic and my Robotron 2084/SmashTV scores have never been higher.It really does dry the sweat from your hands and cool the figners."
4,good controller,"This is a good game controler - very comfortable to use. Not the best layout for buttons, but not bad, either. I recommend it for its comfort and low price."
2,Not truely for beginngers,"I purchased this item so that I could learn Gaelic from a beginner's perspective. I was thinking that it would start out so that a child could learn the language. It acutally started out speaking paragraphs and quite fast so that I could not understand what was going on right from the beginning. Compared to the Rosetta Stone program I purchased, this one is not worth the money."
1,Cosmic Phycho Babble,"A dangerous mind controlling book. The more you read it...the more you need a psychiatrist. Many lives have been totally destroyed by reading this book. It has destroyed thousand of families, marriages, and friendships. Oahspe has spawned numerous mind control cults that have literally wrecked havoc on the reader's lives.Many doomsday and UFO cults have sprung up from this book and its dangerous message. Many, many people still are suffering from the devastation this book has caused.Eric"
4,Excellent reference that needs proof reading.,"This comprehensive, well organized guide to using Vegas 6 is the perfect reference for the first time or experienced user. Spotted Eagle's style is light and easy to follow while still providing in depth, well detailed examples. Some very basic concepts, such as equipment connection schemes, will appeal to new users while complex video editing technique descriptions will be useful to editing professionals.That the book contains countless typographical errors is annoying to the reader and also contributes to a slight unease as to the overall credibility of the book. This aside, Vegas 6 Editing Workshop is an indispensable aid when working with Vegas 6 software."
2,Beginners beware,"I was looking for a beginner's guide. I'm sure this is an excellent guide for experienced users, but for a novice, this is not your book."
2,It'd be wise to give this book a miss.,"I had to read Wise Children for my A-level English lit class. I'm not fond of this book to say the least and it pains me to think I have to reread it sometime soon. It's unnecessarily filled with incestuous relationships written in the most dire and ponderous narrative possible from the view of a 75 year old woman reminiscing her long gone heydays.Carter's language has the potential in creating something of a worthy read but the structure and content of the novel diminish and incinerate every possibilty. As if the narrative isn't dire as it is, the chronology of events are manipulated and Dora digresses a great deal. We're soon left wondering What The Hell Is Going On? and need to re-read the same paragraph to grasp hold of the labrynth like links between each events.This book lacks in a plot with any substance and ends exactly how it started. What a waste of time."
3,An Unfortunate Requirement,"I was required to read this book for (strangely enough) my post-modern lit course. This book (in my opinion) is not post-modern...It was easier to read than most ""post-modern"" books are, which is probably why it was a relief to read it.It did nothing for me. I do not have a strong background in Shakespeare to fully understand the inuendos of the book. The ""tragedy"" of the twins' distance from their father stirred nothing, nor did the ""comedic"" aspects which seemed just absurd.If this is a required read, then read it. It's pretty easy to read, though there is a lot going on so it is important to understand and follow every character and plot that is woven in.I wouldn't read this for pleasure, personally. It's a silly book."
1,Wise Children - Bad Mistake,"I was forced to painfully read this awful, shocking book for my A-level course. I don't understand what is happening in thisbook, as Angela Carter randomnly goes from one topic to another without any explanation or plot.Seriously, do not read this unless forced to do so.It is 232 pages of random anecdotes and stories from a weird and boring life of Dora Chance, who at the end of the story, aged 75, decides to go to bed with her 100 year old uncle. SICK."
4,I enjoyed it,"I read this for an English course for my minor and I enjoyed the shakespearian references as well as carter's blending of tragedy and comedy throughout the story, and the legitimate and illegitimate. What I loved about this book best was carter's ability to make the reader visualize what is going on with the protagonist and her twin like it's a movie unfolding. Carter herself compares certain parts of the book to how a particular scene is too dramatic as though from a movie, the imagery is that good."
2,"Ugh, I wish I hadn't even attempted it","I kept plodding through the (very long and tedious) first chapter for 50+ pages, thinking this thing was eventually going to really get started, become engaging, and stop nattering away about inconsequential (and often terribly esoteric/antiquarian and/or cryptically British), excessive details and convoluted family trees. Practically 1/4 through the book and you don't care a fig about even one of the plethora of introduced characters. Wise Children DIDN'T get any better, and that's when I put my foot down and hauled it back to the library."
4,Persistence pays off,"A good read with characters that seem real and a bit of a twist at the end. The book starts pretty simply and is pretty predictable at the start. But then when you get past the training it picks up the pace, has adventure and romance and surprises. And it all hangs together well and moves quickly until it is over and done with all the loose ends wrapped up."
3,The spy stradecraft lessons are interesting but....,"This is a story about Heller, a CIA techie here in the US whose fiancee is killed by terrorists in Europe. He decides that revenge -- killing the terrorists who killed her -- is his best course of action, blackmails his superiors into training him, then goes to Europe to do the job. The overarching problem I had with this book is that Heller did not seem suffienciently motivate. Consequently, his course of action seemed implausible. I had heard a lot of good things about Littell (and maybe he's gotten better -- this book is 20 years old. His knowledge of spy tradecraft is as advertised, but when it comes to the craft of writing, he is lacking. Trite metaphors and cliche's abound. Characterization is better than some in this genre, but a far cry from LeCarre, to whom he's compared on his dust jackets. All in, not bad to kill a plane ride. And if you like insider-CIA stuff, this won't dispappoint."
2,Disappointing,The story concerns a CIA cryptographer who wishes to assasinate the terrorists that killed his fiance. Good premise but the story contains so many coincidences and cliches that it just doesn't seem believable. Most of the story moves at a good pace - lagging only in a few spots. I don't recommend this book - there are much better thrillers on the market.
3,Fantastic CIA novel,"The writing was a bit difficult at times, but the story was GREAT! Heller is a cryptologist who blackmails the CIA. You know you want to read it rather than hearing more about it!"
4,canon sd30 adapter,"Nice adapter for a great camera, but I don't like the fact that the camera has to be in a 'dock' for everything. It would be better if you could just connect it directly to the computer for retrieving pictures and/or the power adapter for charging."
3,A big watch!,"I love the features on this watch such as the date, timer, and light but it is sooo big! I have a tiny wrist and sometimes I feel like it is too bulky and unconfortable. If you have descent size wrist and you don't mind bulk jewerly...I highly recommend it!"
3,Decent...but not for everyday.,"I like this watch however it is a bit to thick for my wrist. When I wear it, the band gets in the way when I extend (lift upward) my hand moving the watch in such a way it kinda digs into my forearm. The band also gets dirty easily. I do like the look though."
1,Kindle formatting errors,"I purchased the Kindle edition of this book in 2007 and found many unrecoverable formatting errors. I did report the errors, and they refunded my money. I keep hoping they will fix it. If you purchase it, go to locations 516-28 to see if it is fixed. If not, return it."
2,dont know,"did not come with instructions, went on superlift website and could not find instructions for 3261. Havnt tried to put it together yet so yea"
5,Best Textbook in a long time!,"This textbook perfectly outlines each chapter. The author states the important points before going into depth. If you find yourself reading a textbook for class and having to re-read over and over again because you keep zoning out, this book really helps. I found it to be very interesting and a helpful study tool."
5,Excellent Text!,"This is a textbook that I actually enjoyed reading from cover to cover. It is an excellent introduction to evolution, primatology, and anthropology. Highly recommended for either the undergrad or the layman."
2,This book is just not that good,"I did not find this book to be particularly well written, and I don't really understand the praise heaped upon this novel in most of the other reviews. The character development is weak and the plot is shallow. In general, detail is sorely lacking. Even the occasional references for ""detailing of the laws of magic"" are merely a sentence or two. On the plus side, I did finish the book. There are some entertaining passages, but overall, I did not find it very satisfying. There is much better Fantasy out there."
1,Um...this book is terrible,"I don't understand why this book has gotten so many over-the-top reviews. (Though, judging by some consistencies in style in many of the reviews, I suspect a lot were written by one person.) This is one of the lousiest fantasies I've ever read, and everyone I've pushed it on (maliciously, in fun), agrees. The concept of analytically describing the various types of magic is an interesting one, but the writing is so bland, so pedestrian, so rigidly following a naked outline, that the bones of the organizational skeleton poke out all over. Seriously, if you are an experienced reader and value good fiction, this is not the book for you. For good fantasy, I'd suggest Guy Kay's engaging and beautifully written novels, particularly Fionavar Tapestry, Tigana, Song for Arbonne, and The Lions of Al-Rassan."
5,Why has the series not been reprinted?! Hardcover Trilogy Requested!,"I love all of Lyndon Hardy's books. To my knowledge he has written only three novels ""Master of Five Magics"", ""Secret of the Sixth Magic"", and ""Riddle of the Seven Realms"". The fantasy world building and rules of each system/type of magic in the novels are fun to read and make for a fun romp. I just wish that a publisher would wake up and reprint these. I would love to buy a hardcover set of all three in the trilogy so if any publishers are listening give us a reprinted collectors set please. If you are already a fan of Lydon Hardy I would recommend you read Lawrence Watt-Evans Ethshar books while we wait for reprints of these.Secret of the Sixth Magic: (#2)Riddle of the Seven RealmsThe Misenchanted Sword: A Legend of Ethshar (Legends of Ethshar)With a Single SpellDragon Weather (Obsidian Chronicles)"
3,Quickly read is quickly shelved,"I felt that the book was essentially five books crammed into about 350 pages. A story of a genius young hero-to-be that learns a good bit of each of the five types of magic as well as sword play, ridiculously fast. The magic is interesting but I wish that the concept of the ""Archimage"" (title of the final chapter, not a spoiler) at the end would have been more then 19 pages (most of which had little to do with the Archimage)... The young hero has a good heart and is very intelligent but you find that out on page one with little more development.On the plus side, it is a unique take on magic and how different base desires can uniquely tempt the arts: Thaumaturgy to Vanity, Alchemy to Greed, Magic to Pride, Sorcery to Lust, and Wizardry to Envy. To learn all of the arts the hero must also overcome each of his desires in one way or another.While it was a fun enough read, I do not think I will revisit Master of the Five Magics for a good while."
2,A big yawn...,"Yes, I agree with the other reviewers that Baxter displays a keen sense of language and there are occasional light touches that made me snicker. However, the problem for me is that I don't give a hoot for Saul and this feeling remains unchanged by the end of the book. When I turned the last page, I was just glad to be done with a boring book."
2,In like a puddytat...out like a lambypie,"What a promising start and what a disappointing payoff. Some of Saul Bernstein's reactions and observations about the Midwest, and Patsy's long-suffering reactions, are truly hilarious. If you love to recall the scene in Annie Hall where Alvie Singer worries incessantly about the possible anti-Semitic overtones of the phrase, ""Did you eat?"" you'll love this stuff. But the plot does not hold one's interest...especially after a denoument that lacks much punch and an ending that might leave you gratified about the hero's character development, but ultimately unimpressed with the role he takes on in his chosen community. Those who have said that this novel reads like the collection of short stories from which it sprang, and not like a complete work of literature in and of its self seem to be right on the money."
4,"Winning, well-structured novel","I'm surprised at how many negative reviews this novel has gotten. It took me a while to get into it -- Saul and Patsy's relationship, the familiar anxious Jew/sunny Gentile dynamic there, didn't strike me as terribly promising -- but as the plot thickened with the appearance of Saul's disturbed student, Gordy Himmelman, and the interweaving of interesting family subplots, I began to find it un-putdownable. Baxter's style is so intelligent and flowing as to seem a bit facile -- this might be off-putting to some. But as the content gets darker, the sparkle and fluidity of the style is a welcome counterpoint. (That sense of counterpoint, darkness to light, seems to me to be the central theme of the novel. ) Aside from its long-ish beginning, this is a very tightly contructed story and generally a fun read."
4,What is the park like?,"This is another great book from childhood. The illustrations are detailed and fun; the colors pink and blue and green predominate. A day's visitors and activities are described, beginning with the parks department guy who spears paper and gum wrappers to the knitting mothers with baby carriages to the elderly gentleman who seeks a place to spend the night. Morning commuters rush through the park without really seeing it; in the late afternoon they enjoy its breezes and the sunset through its trees. Children love swinging, playing in sandboxes, and sailing toy boats in a massive fountain. Some grownups stroll in couples, and others bring their pet dogs to have the run of the place at night. There seems to be this theme that everyone gets something out of the neighborhood park, and that the park waits while its neighbors go through the cycles of meals and sleep, knowing they will return again soon."
4,Viking's vg controller,"i know some people ssaid that they had trouble with the battery cover coming off, but my husband (who i bought the controller for) has had no troubles whatsoever. the only drawback, was that it had a slightly different button configuration that his old controller by the same company)."
4,"Christmas in Camelot (Magic Tree House, No. 29)","The book is a gift for my 8-year-old grandson, and I know he loves this series of books. I was a bit disappointed in the condition of the book when I received the shipment. The book jacket was crumpled on the bottom. I worked at it a bit to straighten it out, put it under some other heavy books, and it looks okay now. However, after paying for a brand new book that is a gift, I think it ought to look better."
1,What happened?,"What happened? Magic Tree House series books 1-28 were great, with educational tales filled with historical relevance that used just enough magic to make the story work. Buy the complete set of 1-28! However, the Christmas book (#29) and apparently all the following books are pure magic, fantasy drivel with no redeeming qualities. Did Mary Pope Osborne hope to capitalize on the Harry Potter craze? (I'm basing this on heresay, since I haven't read Harry Potter.) I slogged thru this book, cringed and gagged thru #30, and made my wife read the next ones to my 5 year old. I'm going to tell him there aren't anymore, because they are too awful to buy and read.I very, very disappointed in what happened to this series. Please, please Mary Pope - get back to writing good stories and not this nonsense."
3,Book-Series,"Book arrived in a timely manner. Was suprised it didn't have a dust cover as that was not stated in advertisement. However, book was in good shape."
1,Christmas in Camlot,It was really good it showed the reader it did not tell and Pacific details.What I did not like is that the story had to much and in itJack saidAnne said
5,Chapter book for 4 year old,"We found out that our four year old was excited about listening to chapter books - but after a few here and there that we found to be age appropriate, we were without ideas. We asked our local librarian who really didn't have any ideas for us - and then we lucked into Magic Tree House books. They are a treasure! Annie and Jack's adventures are not only age appropriate for a curious 4 year old, but they introduce history and situations that we would be otherwise unlikely to grab her attention (Shakespeare, civil rights, etc). These books never get old to her - and it is rather refreshing to not have all the marketing items (dolls, bed sheets, etc) that usually get pushed with a product."
3,They are ok and are as advertised,The product is in good condition and work as expected. The case and balls inside were very dusty and dirty though. A quick rinse and dusting made them better but these must have been in the warehouse for ages.
1,Unexpectedly bad quality,I found these balls of a very cheap quality. They are smaller than I expected. They are not even smooth as they should be. The box was broken and full of stains. I was so embarrassed to give them to my friend who asked for similar balls to mine. When I ordered these balls I thought I will get the same quality that I purchased in the local market but the shop was out of them. I was shocked when I received these balls and I do not think I will ever order from this company again.
1,Product Description,"This product is supposed to be 38mm, a small size. I'm six one and 180 pounds. I can just about get them in my hand. If these are small, I can't imagine how big the large size are. And with the return policy, I have no choice but to throw them in the trash. I guess It's live and learn. I'll shop around locally the next time to see what I'm buying."
5,awesome hand exercise balls,"many blessings to allI am so very pleased with my purchase, the 2 balls I recieved are beautiful shades of green,with bird design on one and dragon on the other.The bells or chimes with in each have a diffent sound is so cool,&fit; my small hands perfect~ as most simular type balls I have bought before were too largeand came in a beautiful functional box as shown in image ,"
3,cheap imitation,"I ordered these because I tried a set with yin-yangs that looked similar. These are not the same as the ones I had tried, they feel more... rubbery or plastic-like. They are also quite light weight and within a week one of the bells was broke, clink, clink. I ordered two pair however. I also ordered from the person selling the silver Chinese health balls, these are the ones I use now. please point me at the authentic product, the real thing is no sham. It will improve your posture and well-being and should be used for months to see best result. Your plastic imitations give Baoding balls a bad name. This box and balls appear similar to the original but don't be fooled. You'll know when you have the real ones by the weight you feel and the cool whirring sound they make when you get them going."
2,My balls are all rough and scratched.,"These are some low quality balls. Mine are somewhat pitted and rough feeling. Too, I wish I could find a pair without the chimes. I don't really get the whole jingle balls thing.OTOH, I'm betting that unless you buy metal balls that they're all about this same low quality. I wonder what they're made of? Think they're toxic? I had no intention of doing so, but I won't be putting these in my mouth."
2,Received the wrong item,"The baoding balls picture above were not the ones I received (the ones I was sent were much smaller, and I think they were plastic -- the cloisonné was also completely messed up). For the price, it wasn't really worth returning (they were going for $2.50 when I bought them)."
2,disappointed in product,I ordered 3 sets of the blue balls. The balls look pretty but feel dirty when first touching them. There were no instructions in ANY of the boxes and the boxes look fragile and worn. I was very disappointed because now I have to search for directions because they were supposed to be a present but what good are they without directions???
4,Nice and light for night time sleeping and rapid twirling!,"THE CHIMES SOUND GREAT ONE OF THE BEST SOUNDING CHIMES SO CRISP AND CLEAR! IF YOU WANT TO GET THINGS OFF OF YOUR MIND, JUST TWIRL THEM UNTIL YOU ARE ALMOST ASLEEP AND JUST BEFORE YOU GO UNDER YOU CAN PUT THEM IN YOU PJ POCKETS. NIGHT NIGHT LOL I WASN'T TOO THRILLED ABOUT THE ART WORK I THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE RUSHED/SLOPPY BUT THE BALLS ARE SHINY AND PRETTY, A COUPLE OF PARTS STICK OUT AND MAY SCRATCH YOU, I GUESS THOSE ARE THE MINOR FAULTS WHEN THEY WERE BEING ENAMELED, BUT AS YOU CONTINUE TO TWIRL THE UNEVEN ENAMEL AREAS THAT PROTRUDE WILL PROTRUDE NO LONGER ESPECIALLY IF YOU USED THEM OFTEN! MAKE SURE YOU USE SUPER SAVER SHIPPING! IF NOT THEY CHARGE A LOT FOR SHIPPING. MY TOTAL: $13.93. WITH SUPER SAVER SHIPPING IT IS $5.99. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
4,Beautiful,They came well packaged and undamaged. The details are beautiful. The balls themselves are a little smaller than I wanted but that's my own dumb fault for not reading the description thoroughly. They're still great and work perfectly.
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my brother because he loves them, but they were much smaller than what I expected, there not smooth at all , and the drawings on the picture does not match the balls at all, and the box was broken. I might just return them and get my 7 dollars back"
5,Terrific skin.,This is not your typical skincare book. It is straightforward and uses old world remedies to solve your current problems. I have tried her products and her remedies and I have always received immediate results (plus wonderful comments from passerbys).Review the book for yourself.
2,"He Ain't All There, Is He?","The remnants of Lynyrd Skynyrd just keep on truckin, but without Van Zant they basically got nothing going on. If you are an Almond Brothers Fanatic, or a worshipful devotee of Skynard, you might like MTB's uninspired southern boogie posturing, but everyone else should avoid."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,I'm very disappointed that this isn't available in cd form so won't be buying...Would love to leave NO stars but can't....
3,Decent,"Okay quality, decent construction, arrived on time and undamaged. only 1 problem: The bar is about half a foot too short. had to get a Gold's Gym bar from Wal-Mart."
4,Good Stuff!,"If you're looking for an affortable equipment then this is the right stuff for you.Pros: you just cant beat this price, ever!the clips are great. the bars are great. everything is in place.Cons: The weights do not actually weight the same comparing to the metal plate weightsand its a bit dirty and ""destroyed"" when it first arrived at my doorOverall: its great stuff, if you dont mind the appearance of it. And u'll probably gonna need some extra weights over time bc 115 just isnt that much."
2,not strong dumbbell's bar,"My husband uses little heavy dumbbells.After using dumbbells, he keeps them on the holding bar.Holding bar is bending little bit because of it's weight.I think bar is not strong enough to hold heavy dumbbells.It should be redesigned strong but not heavy.Also dumbbell is not so great.Mine was delivered as broken condition.Amazon gave me a 10% credit but looks not good anyway.If I want to buy same, I will go to shopping center and try and buy them."
3,Don't expect much.,"Number 1, make sure that your weight bench is the right size for these. the inner section of the bar is only 31"", and a lot of racks are too big for that.Number 2, these weights will probably never work with any other bar you get, so don't consider it a foundation of set.However, that said its a decent set for the price, everything went together quickly when I got it, and all my components were there. The box had not survived and FedEx covered it with packaging tape to hold it together, but otherwise its good.Eventually you'll move on to something else, but until then this is a decent set for the price. But don't be like me and buy a nice weight bench expecting to use this with it."
1,NOT THAT IMPRESSED,"I RECEIVED THIS SET TODAY AND UPON INSPECTION, WAS MISSING 2-5LB PLATES. THE BOX WAS VERY WORN WHEN DELIVERED. SOME OF THE PLATES LOOKED AS IF THE POWDER WAS LEAKING OUT. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED"
3,Eeoou,"I just received my order on this items. The package looked fine to me when it arrived. But when I opened and checked all the contents.It missed locking spring clips. And instead of 4 plates of 10 lbs. I got 5 plates!! I do not need additional plate, I really need those missing locking spring clips!!I try to look for the US Weight contact number so I can place order. But I can not find it. Do I have to contact Amazon.com or what. Please help!!!"
1,JUNK..DO NOT BUY THIS SET,"CAUTION: READ PRODUCT DESCRIPTION VERY CAREFULLY!!!!!!!! These are really cheezy, cheap, plastic, sand filled weights. The weights are not accurate..I weighed them, they are not true to weight. The bar is thin and cheezy...actually seems dangerous to use as it is a hollow metal tube. The ""weights"" are thick, clunky, oversized plastic discs that leak...I just don't know how anyone can use them. I wanted real metal plates, but wasted my money on this junk. Oh, BTW, returning is not an option as the box was a ripped up piece of junk that was taped together with miles of packing tape and had to be cut open. So now I'm out of luck."
1,Im Missing my 2 dumbbells,i order my weights yea im happy cuz is here but im mada cuz it didnt bring the dumbbells
3,Not thrilled,"I was surprised by the size of the weights. Not thrilled with them, but they will do in a pinch."
4,missing pieces,"Recently received this weight set. Packaging was intact, no problems there. Nice set of weights, heavy duty vinyl that won't hurt the floors.Set was supposed to come with two dumbbell bars, but they were not in the box. Amazon Customer Service says they can't help with missing parts, and my only option was to return it. Not so easy. It weighs 120 lbs., I'm on the third floor and it took two of us to get up the stairs. Since we had already unpacked and put together the long bar (which can not be taken apart once put together), I can't return it.I called the manufacturer (US Weight, Inc) and they said they will be sending me the two short dumbbell bars. Time will tell if indeed I do get them.Overall, I'm pleased with the product.I've been dealing with Amazon for sometime, and this is the first time I have been disappointed with their customer service. I truly hope it is the last."
2,"Slick and pretty, but not very interesting","As if Burnett needed more marketing for his piece d'resistance, hit TV series Survivor, here comes a pretty picture book to make you feel bad for having missed the first series. Except... Burnett should feel bad for missing the strengths of the first series' BOOK. Unlike the ""Field Guide"" to Survivor I, there's little interesting in the way of additional material or structural insight. If you're a Survivor fanatic, you may enjoy some banter about Australia's surivalist history and environment. If you need some toilet reading, you may enjoy the study cover and pretty pictures. If you're looking for something intelligent, exciting, and revealing, this ain't it."
3,survivor - palau: country tie-ins,"It seems as if Survivor will be airing yet another show in 2005 as Survivor-10 or Survivor-Palau.I wonder how much these show actually help the host country? For example, the country domain is .pw and www.survivor.pw could be used as a fan site for Survivor-Palau. Have the show's producers considered this?"
1,"Don't Waste Your Time, Survivor Fans","I made the mistake of reading Field Guide after Survivor II aired, but -- even if I had done so beforehand -- it likely would have been just as boring. Unlike Mark Burnett's first book, which was almost as exciting as the t.v. show, Field Guide contained 150 pages of pure filler. From its ""strategy sessions"" to its extremely generic contestant profiles to its plethora of full page photographs, this book was a waste of time, plain and simple."

3,This is a good book for anyone planning to apply to the show,"For anyone who plans to try out for the next Survivor (or the one after that) this is a great book. It features questions asked of the castaways (for part two) when they were trying out for the show. It also has a list of the 16 different ways a person on Survivor might go about playing the game (being the entertainer or the snake) and the advantages and disadvantages of each one. For example the downfall of being trying to be the entertainer is that it gets old soon and no one likes a bad entertainer. Playing the snake (like Richard Hatch did in part one) worked once, but the book cautions that future contestants may try to find the snake early on and boot that person off. Buy this book now, if you want to apply and you will have a chance to have answers in advance in case you are interviewed by Mark Burnett."
5,A keeper,"I've had this book for at least 15 years, and -- despite the pressure of living in an apartment that's seven paces long and three paces wide -- I've never even considered tossing it. I still re-read it occasionally and, of course, lend it out. It's clever and it's funny and the two together are like chocolate and peanut butter, you know."
2,Only Fair,"The plot of the book. Madeleine St. Cross is the beauty of the family. Her family is living in genteel poverty, with Madeleine the only hope of repairing their fortunes. She must marry well. She will be traveling to London to try to catch a wealthy husband. Enter Major John Ashton. Madeleine falls in love with him but, must marry for money, so she does. From here on the story just moves slowly along, with the reader wondering how the two people who love each other will end up together. I felt that the story moved too slowly and lost interest in what was going to happen. However there are some unexpected twists in the plot that I didn't expect. Not one of the regency stories I would recommend to someone."
4,A Ceiling of Stars,"A Ceiling of Stars starts out with Vivien sending a letter titled, ""to the person who finds this tent"". Through letters and journal entries, Viven tells how she survived without a mother who had been seen around at bars late at night and her father who died even before that. Vivien becomes a city girl known on the streets as ""Copper Top"" and her range of friends include Skinny Willie, Sergeant Sam ( who thinks he is an officer) Catman, Mags and Locket. Vivien tells the hardships she has to face and visions about life before her father and mother basically disappeared out of her life."
4,A Ceiling of Stars,"I LOVED this book. Its almost made me cry. Hey, if you liked this book, or want to read this book, you should also read 'StarGirl' and 'A Song For Jeffery'"
3,Competitive specs/price - delivery performance lacking,"I am somewhat disappointed with it's accuracy in the mA range for both AC and DC since that was my primary purpose for purchasing the meter. It will measure mA but I've had times where it generated wrong results eventhouogh I had selected the correct scale and zero'd the meter out.I've worked around this by making sure of the approximate value before using the clamp meter by using a traditional meter. The meter seems to do well as long as I take that step, which is ok since I am using the clamp primarily for recording current waveforms on a scope."
3,Not all are great,"Where as there are some songs on the CD which are good there are some which I found tedious and couldn't wait for them to be over. However, the two songs that are good I can add to another CD copy and have only those I enjoy. So it was worth the purchase just to have the two songs that I like."
4,Different songs on CD,I was disappointed that the selection of songs on the CD were not exactly the same as the ones on the record album. There is only three songs on the CD that are also on the record album. Anyway I still liked the CD.
5,Memories!,"Not only is this CD in perfect condition, but having it on CD was clearer and allowed me to visit the past!"
4,Epicurean Wine Preserver Rechargeable Wine Saver,"This is the second Epicurean wine pump that I have purchased. First one died after 3 years of use. So, not too bad life for being used daily. It is very easy to use, does a much better job than the hand pump and the best benefit, it keeps your wine fresh for 3 days. I drink a glass a night, so it is wonderful to know that you don't have to waste a $25 dollar bottle of wine for just one glass. I would HIGHLY recommend this pump to those that drink partial bottles."
2,Awful,"I tried it my favorite razor, Parker SR1 which is a straight razor with disposable blades, one of my favorite blades, Astra (a new blade of course), and did the usual process to prepare my face. It was a disaster and I basically destroyed my face.When it says brushless it's because it doesn't even give you the option like C.O. Bigelow or The Art of Shaving. There is no way to use a brush with it. I'm glad I bought the 2.5 oz and not the 5 oz."
2,Disappointed,"I looked forward to this album as a number of my favorite songs were on it but I was disappointed that songs like ""Hard Times"" and ""Lady Margaret"" were not sung all the way to the end. Both left off about two thirds of the way through the song. I mean if you aren't going to sing the complete song, why bother?"
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I may have been spoiled witht the excellent recordings on the ""Return to Cold Mountain"" soundtrack (which shares some of the songs with this CD), but the quality of the playing on this CD just seems rather poor to me. I think better musicians can achieve a better result of these often nice tunes, which unfortunately are not that well played."
1,POOR SOUND QUALITY,"Gloria Lasso is a good singer and there are nice songs on this 2-CD edition. But the sound quality of the recordings is terrible. No, this is not worth the money... Too bad..."
3,Good but be warned that...,"...this is a king of a prequel to the album True North. Don't be surprised, if you have bought True North before, you will be quite familiar with this ONE.""Every time"" is the only song that don't appears on both album.For big fan only. Which that I am."
1,Not the best I have seen,"This book was a good effort but not worth your while to read. It was given to me by a denominational executive to read and I found it lacking in several areas. The authors seem unaware of current trends that are effecting rural churches across Canada and the United States. While this book may provide some insight, if you are pastoring a rural church, you know everything that they have written already."
2,Not the definitive biography of Pete Ellis,"Although ostensibly a biography of Ellis, the book tends to focus on other high-profile Marines of the era and the internacine service rivalries that Ellis lived through. Although discussing in the beginning of the book certain peculiarities surrounding Ellis' death (specifically the behavior of Chief Pharmacist Zembsch after recovery of Ellis' remains), the authories summarily dismiss any mystery at the end of the book by stating that Ellis died of alcholism. All in all an interesting read, but certainly not the in-depth biography of Pete Ellis that one might infer from the title."
1,Horrible Book,This is a terrible book. The author's have zero evidence to back up their poorly positioned arguments. They use evolution to make vast statements that justify the worst of humanity. The theories in the book are just extensions of outdated models of social Darwinism. Poorly written. Poorly Researched. Don't Buy.
5,great service!,Overall a great transaction. I placed my order and it was processed quickly and shipped and I received it in the condition promised in a short amount of time. Thank You
2,Not What I Expected,"A major disappointment for anyone hungering for the skirl of the pipes, as it's almost entirely either the regimental band, or the combined bands. Only a few selections by the pipes and drums alone. A good choice only if you like the regimental sound."
2,Philosophy 101,"I found this book very disappointing. Mainly it consists of airy and inconclusive statements about various web-related issues. A sample, the closing sentence for Part One: ""It would seem that being focused on and aware of the specific and particular needs and requirements of the electronic reader--your reader--is the about the most we can hope to do."" There's too much philosophizing and too little practical information. Even being a relative newcomer to the web design field, I found little in this book I didn't already know. There are a couple of interesting discussions, but the author could easily have made his point in a couple pages rather than an entire chapter. I'm sure there are better resources for web writers than this one."
3,What a Mishigas!!,"Like most, if not all of the previous reviewers of this book I found it a great story of the Purples' but quite how it made the shelves with all those mistakes is beyond me! At times I found myself reading and then re-reading the same paragraphs just to make sure I understood what was going on.......shame on you Barricade Books of NY."
4,The Purple Gang,"I grew up during the era of the Purple Gang, and once when I was very young, my attention was drawn to their touring car, with the ""bullet-proof"" windows. They were ruthless hoodlums! Not too long ago, I took a tour of Jackson Prison, and I understand that at one time the Purple Gang ruled Jackson Prison, which you can read in the book. The book is most interesting, because the Purple Gang played a major part in the history of Detroit. The book is not lengthy, you can pick it up anytime to read, and before you know it, you're finished."
2,Great topic -- disappointing result,"After hearing an interview with the author on a local radio show I couldn't wait to buy this book.I live in Hamtramck, less than a mile from where the Purples got their start, and I was hoping for a definitive chronicle of their rise and fall, with names, dates and locations that I could relate to. Instead, I got an extended, poorly-edited outline that begged for more detailed and specific exposition.While I don't regret my purchase I was sorely disappointed and sincerely hope that Mr. Kavieff will expand his research and revise the book with the assistance of a more competent editor and publisher. I also strongly recommend he read Lowell Cauffiel's ""Masquerade"" for pointers on how to write a masterful tale of the Detroit underbelly."
2,The Purple Gang,"I am sorry, this book suffers terribly from a number of problems. I found it to be quite superficial in it's content. Were it only a problem with the author I could overlook it's problems as a sincere effort by an author who was interested enough in the subject to write a book, but the real crime is in the editing and publishing/printing. This book was allowed to be released with so many printing errors that it distracts the reader almost completely. I am sorry to say a book that deals with a subject that I find of great interest does so in such a poor way. It appears that a stronger editor was needed to organize the content and oversee the publication."
5,a bit of Detroit History never told before.,"Great read, a time in Detroit's history that was all but forgotten, writen like you were there. Clears up all the ""false Purple Gang Stories"". Highly Recommended."
3,"ok chair, sturdy but FIRM","this is a pretty solid chair, it glides nicely but prospective customers need to realize that it is FIRM. Actually it seems a bit hard. You sit down with kind of a thump. If you want a cushy soft chair, this is not the product for you."
4,"Again, nice but short","If you like disasters, then this DVD is for you. It briefly covers a dozen or so events including shipwrecks, air crashes, space craft and satellite problems, nuclear powerplants, dams and bridges.Nearly all of these disasters could have a full length documentary or movie about it (such as Apollo 13), but don't expect in-depth technical analysis of each problem in the 3 minutes or so per event shown here.As with most of the DVD's in this Modern Marvels series, the run-time is optimistic. In this case, credits roll at the 43-minute mark. Still, it's an entertaining disaster smorgasbord."
1,Misleading advertisement,"The price shown is for ONE gutter guard, and NOT for a box of 50. Thus, the ad is very misleading. I complained to this seller months ago, and he refuses to change his ad. In my opinion, this is a very shady situation."
5,Loved It!,"Highly recommend the series! I bought the lot for my vaguely Christian sister-in-law. They are wonderful for any Christian. While we Catholics use the Liturgy of the Hours, Tickles's Divine Hours are put together in a similar manner. But easy to use for any busy (and even non-denominaitonal) Christian."
3,FAIR BUT CUMBERSOME,"I was very enthusiastic when I came across Tickle's manual for prayer. Over the years I had explored many prayer books none of which held my attention. Then ""The Divine Hours"" came to my view and I thought my quest was over. Alas, I was sorely disappointed. The Divine Hours is a somewhat good manual for those starting out in attempting fixed prayer. Unfortunately I found its use problematic when it divorced itself from the liturgical year. I was surprised about the absense of inclusive language and the small number of women's works, prayers and hymns that were not included in the text. I don't call myself a purist when it somes to prayer books but I feel the author could have done a better job in being more balanced with the prayers (traditional as well as modern) and following the liturgical year. This is one more prayer book to keep as a resource guide in your theological library."
4,History of Dutch wooden skates,"Not only did they use wooden shoes in the Netherlands, they used wooden skates as well. This book traces the history of the skate from its use in medieval times right up to the last makers of the wooden skates in the Netherlands. The book is nicely illustrated with the various types of skate which have been sold the last century, as well as with photographs of the factories and the people who did run them. When you're interested in the history of skating this is a very worthwhile book, but the language used -Dutch- could prevent really understanding of the text for those who can't read it. There is also a second edition of this book, published by another publisher in Franeker, 1988."
2,"Termites: Evolucion, Sociality, Symbiosis, Ecology","Y received only the Part II of the book Termites...and Y want reveive the Part I obviously.Y wait your answer and the solution, because Y payed thetwo parts, I and II.Thanks i advanceProf. Luiz Carlos Pinheiro Machado"
4,CLA Help me lose hard to remove fat,I prefer Nature Made CLA versus other brands because with Nature Made I ingest 2 servings with a meal in lieu of taking another brand which advises a serving before a meal. All of the vitamins and supplements that I take seem to work better when I take them with a meal. I believe the CLA is better absorbed in my digestion system with food as opposed to taking CLA before a meal
5,Very Satisfied,"I am very satisfied with this product. I have dry, sensitive, and reactive skin and have suffered from adult acne for almost 8 years. I use the Eucerin Clear Skin foaming wash each evening and this toner in the morning and evening. My skin is in very good condition and I don't use skin medications any more. This product does not dry out my skin. It works well and is quite affordable."
1,damaged on arrival,The dartboard cabinet was damaged in 3 places - around two hinges and also at the center of the top cross piece. The box was not damaged so this didn't happen in shipping. We tried for a replacement but after 2 weeks there is still not clear date that it's available.
2,"Nice Board, Cabinet...not so much","The cabinet I received was damaged, the inside of the right door was scratched and the bottom of the right door was chipped. I sent it back for a refund."
2,Dartboard nice. . Cabinet not so good,"Ordered this DMI product and upon receipt of the product noticed the compressed wood that the cabinet is made of was cracked on all sides on the back (as if the wood was brittle) With the cracks on the compressed wood, there was no support for the panel that was to hold the entire cabinet to the wall. The cracks were not due to shipping. The (compressed)wood that the cabinet is made with is very poor quality and will not support the weight of the cabinet once mounted. The dartboard it came with was nice. Returned product immediately"
3,Expect a trip to Lowes,"Arrived with parts of hinges all over the place (springs, plastic parts and hinge pins) - being a DIY fan not a big problem but expect a trip to your local hardware company to buy replacement hinges before you can use this item..... Made in China the supplied hinges are just plain useless - even Lowes Chinese made hinges were better.For the price I like this unit but expect to use your DIY skills or you'll be returning this one......."
3,It works but....,Yes it muffles the sound but the toms are hard to tune and sound like sh...... SO I removed the and bought room insulation....
5,A gift that keeps on giving,"Being a fairly new fan of Porcupine Tree and Steven Wilson, I was not familiar with any of this material when the DVD came out. Since then, I've watched it a couple times, and listened to the CD version at least a dozen times.This is a richly layered work. It not only encourages repeated listening, it pretty much demands it. It also rewards it immensely. This package gets my highest recommendation. A bargain at twice the price."
4,Get All You Deserve [Blu-ray] Steven Wilson,"Another excellent concert video from Steven Wilson - the songs, the band, the video and the sound on this blu-ray are incredible. For fans of Steven Wilson, no more needs to be said: you need to buy this. For anyone unfamiliar with Steven Wilson: you need to buy this!"
5,I Expected It to be Awesome... It's Better Than I Expected.,The quality and dimension of the sound and surround mix in the Blue Ray of the concert rivals Steven Wilson's original studio recording of Grace for Drowning. Plus you get the impeccable high-resolution video of the concert program to go with it. Can't miss with this one.
1,There MUST be a better master tape for this album,"My one-star rating reflects the quality of this album's transfer to CD, NOT the quality of the album itself, which is excellent. Collectables seems to have used a master tape several generations removed from the original, and a damaged master, at that. So, in addition to plenty of tape hiss, we get a song (""Funky Me"") that ping-pongs back and forth across the stereo with another song superimposed over it, backwards, on the left channel. This disc is the reason why I'm wary of Collectables' CDs."
3,"Timmy Thomas ""Why can't we live together""","While the title tune is a classic R&B classic, the other songs on the CD seem to be the ramblins of the songwriter."
4,pretty good case,"You can get a lotta stuff in this case. The double lining (one removable case inside the outer shell) is nice - added protection. I haven't tried it yet but I think I can sneak this on the plane as hand held luggage though it is a little large by TSA standards. The little stand thingy that flops out in the back to support it at a 45 degree angle is a nuisance, and I will probably just cut it off eventually. Bag bling, who needs it? Would have liked a few additional dividers. The tripod hanger is also a nuisance, and is largely unusable really. Bag bling again. Other than that, good bag, well constructed and if it lives up to the standards of my trekker, indestructable."
2,Didn't work for me,"I have super-dry hands that crack and bleed over the colder months. I had seen positive reviews of this online, so I had high hopes for it-- but it did absolutely nothing for me. As if I hadn't used anything at all. I was applying it every 2 hours for weeks and nothing changed. I even (optimistically) took a ""before"" picture, hoping I could show results. Sadly, there is no ""after"" picture.The 2 stars are because the product goes on fine, doesn't feel greasy, has no particular smell, and is paraben-free. If only it worked on me!"
2,NO BENEFITS,"I wAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT. I LIKED THAT IT WAS NOT GREASY, BUT IT DID NOT MOISTURIZE AND DID NOT WORK FOR ME."
3,Not as moisturizing as I'd hoped,"After hearing some good reviews, I purchased this product to be a night time facial moisturizer. I like that it absorbs quickly without being greasy and there is no smell. However, I have quite dry skin and this alone is not enough. If I apply a serum first and layer this over it works well enough, but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it. For a facial moisturizer, I would say it's better for summer or skin that isn't dry."
3,Ok but not the best,"This lotion works fine but isn't a standout product to me. I ordered it because of some recommendations from other people. I used it for a few weeks and wasn't really impressed. It's a fine lotion but I actually prefer Cerave lotion products over this, which are around the same price but more widely available. It's not a terrible product by any means and may be worth giving it a try. I guess I was just expecting a little more."
2,lisa,i bought this product last week i used it and didn't like it at all.it doesn't work on my dry hand so if you have dry hands and you are looking for a good lotion this isn't it for you it might work on normal skin but not on dry skin.so would not recommend this product.
1,Nope!,"It's too expensive for the amount you get and still haven't really figured out, ""what's the point?"""
5,Very helpful,"I found this book the perfect companion to my month-long trip to Malaysia last year. Very useful. The dictionary is a little brief, but it's pretty good for an intro."
3,Buy 2 1/2 sizes smaller.,"I read ALL the reviews on these ballet slippers and decided to order 2 sizes smaller than I usually wear. Unfortunately I should have ordered 2 1/2 sizes smaller because they were still too big. They also run very wide, which can somewhat be fixed if you tie them tightly. Take my advice: 2 1/2 sizes smaller is the way to go. I wear an 8 1/2 normally and should have ordered a size 6."
4,Good dancing shoe,"I use this shoe to dance, and Amazon was a great place from which to order as I wasn't sure of my size or width. I ordered about 8 pairs. I wasn't happy with the fit of the Capezios (they gapped at the sides) even though the sole went all the way to the back of the heel. The Blochs were better. Take 2 sizes below your normal size, if not 2.5 sizes. I like shoes a little roomier, and I have a borderline wide foot, so the C width was perfect for me. I was able to fit an insole into the shoe and still have it be comfortable. They gap the slightest bit on one foot, and where the elastic was sewn in it irritates my foot on one side due to the stitching, so I put a little moleskin in. I liked the Bloch Prolite Hybrid II also, but these were less expensive and didn't have the split sole or the need to sew in the elastic straps. Overall, I'm happy and will order them again when these wear out."
4,Good,It's comfortable and perfect for my needs. Do buy two sizes smaller. I needed a 6 and purchased a size 4. The 4 fit perfectly.
5,Great buy,Great ballet slippers at half the price. You'd be nuts to pay more! Speedy delivery. I did buy them 1.5 sizes larger as I had read some of the previous reviews. Very happy!
3,worked for use,I did not get these as an actual ballet slipper but for a halloween costume. they worked for what I needed them to-they held up that night
1,sizes are all wrong,I tried two sizes 8 1/2 and a 7 (I wear a size 9 in street shoes) even the 7 was too big.
2,Didn't fit like my other Bloch Ballet Slippers,"I have the exact same slippers in pink and ordered the exact same size, but these are too wide and a little too long. The elastic is further back on the slipper too, making it fit awkwardly. I don't know why the sizing would differ between colors, but it definitely did."
2,"Good concept, fair implementation.","I bought this CellSuit for my 8100. After waiting two weeks for its delivery, I was quite excited to receive it. It fits the phone wonderfully (like a glove ha ha), but I was unhappy with this case. The reason: I felt like the phone did not close all the way when not in use. The parts of the case covering the screen and the keypad make the entire unit thicker (obviously) and the phone does not fit together 100% when it closes. I didn't like that at all. The phone took longer to go into its powersave mode because it thought it was ""open all the way"" even though it really wasn't. So, I sent the case back. Instead, I recommend the Body Glove Wow Pouch which I found at the sprintpcs website."
5,Sleek and great!,This product is perfect for someone one uses their phone alot. It's not big and bulky and its lasted me a year. I've dropped the phone several times and it has not damaged it.
5,samuel morris apostle of simple faith,this book is a good read and i will be reading it again and again
5,Everything is possible with Faith,"Samuel Morris : The Apostle of Simple Faith is simply written and convey the Christian faith to the reader. While reading this book, one feels living in Samuel Morris' era. The book makes you forget that this young African was living in the time when slavery was so deep in this country. Yet, Samuel Morris became the common denominator for both white and black people. His faith saved Taylor University. It is sad that he died so young and so full of promises. Jesus couldn't have a better disciple than this young man."
5,From Slave to Saved,"Samuel Morris was man who Christian wants to relate to. He did more in his short lifetime than many dream of doing. His story comes alive as you read it and makes people reevaluate their own lives. The author gives resources as to where Sammy's story came and offers a balanced view of Sammy, including both strengths and weaknesses. Young adults will love this biography of a teenage Christ follower who overcame great obstacles."
1,Tried Two of These - Both DOA,"Bought one of these at a local GC. First one, only port 1 worked, the rest were dead. Returned it, got another one, totally dead, no working ports. I tried everything you can imagine on both of these units, I was beginning to think that there was something wrong with my system. Exchanged it for a M-Audio Midisport 4x4 Anniversary edition. Installed it and was up on all 4 ports in under 5 minutes.Add in the weird front/back connections for ports 2 and 3, and this unit doesn't cut it. Low price was all it had going for it."
3,A tangled mess,"This doll was opened about 3 hours ago and her hair is already a tangled mess. The ends are all clumped and tangled. Not easily combed out. The more I try to comb it out, the more hair falls out. The hair itself looks like it needs to be cut. I guess they are trying to give her the ""layered"" look, but with different lengths of hair, it's hard for my daughter to ""style"" it. It's a cute idea, I just wish the hair was more easily manageable."
3,Beware of the growing hair!,"This is a very pretty doll, which is why I chose it for my 11 year old. She is really too old for such a toy, so I didn't want to get her any of the ""princess"" style heads. I got it so she could style her hair and practice braiding. She loved the idea, but the fact that this doll's hair ""grows"" means that there is a weird raised hole in the top of her head where the growing section of hair comes from. My daughter can't braid or style her hair because of the big lump (hole) on top of her head!"
3,Good quality....but,"in total our daughters got three (different types) of Barbie ""heads""... most of the time, these things just sit on the shelf. This one has the hair growing feature that DOES WORK. No matter what kind of special features they try to incorporate into these ""heads"", they are still just that - ""heads"". You clip on hair extensions, push the button to grow or shorten the hair, add clips to her hair and there she sits. Our kids asked for this one and the others that they received, but they're not going to get a whole bunch of play time."
3,"Barbie with hair that ""grows""","This barbie head has nice hair, but the only thing that ""grows"" is the small pony tail in the middle. My daughter and I were disappointed."
5,Favorite gift,My 5 year old niece didn't put this toy down from the minute she opened it until she left for home 4 hours later.
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!,I bought this and was excited because I take latin cardio classes and wanted something for the days I don't go. First let me say my daughters have shot better video with their camera. The instructor didn't give proper cues for following and her back up dancers(if they can be called that) were horrible and also found it hard to follow her.I don't know what they were thinking when they made this. I wouldn't even give this away for free. It's in recycables as I type this review. Would have given it .5 star but they didn't have it as a choice.
1,Really bad in all ways,"Horrible sound. Instructor doesn't give instructions and, worst to my mind, has no feel for the music, no sense of rhythm. She hurls her body around, and her movements are jerky, not fluid as most dance requires. Plus, she does certain movements that are notoriously bad to do, such as backward neck rolls and abrupt squats mid-motion. And she calls it ""aerobic,"" which it isn't likely to be for anyone. Should be pulled from the market for both aesthetic and safety reasons!"
1,it can't be worse,"If you want to see a really bad DVD , buy this one . IT is so bad that I could't believe it was in a store and even less in amazon. you can see that people are desperate to make money from whatever trash."
1,Don't buy this video!,"I bought this at Marshall's and was psyched about doing a fun dance workout DVD. Well, there is absolutely no instruction regarding steps or cueing. The DVD begins with the instructor dancing away with no guidance as to how to start whatsoever. I agree with the previous reviewer that the production quality is amateurish. Do yourself a favor and read reviews on these DVDs first, then buy. I did just that this weekend."
3,Practice makes perfect.,"While I agree with the other reviewers that the technical aspect of this video leaves a lot to be desired I though overall it was OK. Its true she does not give much instruction and its a little tough to follow the first time but there is a little section in the menu in which she breaks down the steps. If you do that first it's fine. I have some dance experience so I found it a little easier to follow. I thought it was good from a work out stance. My legs were sore afterward. As with all dance, practice makes perfect. This gets a lot easier to follow the more you do it."
5,"Great ""How-to"" for teaching behavior","In our multicultural society there are as many views of appropriate behavior as there are ethnic, national, or societal groups or religious codes of belief. Today, perhaps more than ever, schools need to cope with the challanges of infusing values into the character of the young. What is a public code of behavior acceptable to all segments of this diversified American society and how do we integrate it into the education of our children? Educators have struggled with this question for the last hundred years. Finally there is a hands-on practical guidebook that gives the principal as well as the classroom teacher a well-defined method of communicating what might be called an American Public Morality. The RICE (R-respect, I impulse control C compassion E quity) Program as developed in Connecting Character to Conduct by Stein, Richin, and Banyon is must reading for all educators. This slender volume will change your life as a teacher."
3,Another cheesy zombie movie.,"If you're into campy zombie movies made by independent studios with limited budgets, this is a movie for you. There is plenty of gore, zombies and originality in this film. It errs a bit on the goofy side, but zombie fans will enjoy it."
5,Kohler Oil Cooler,"This product arrived ultra quickly! Due to the nature of the product, I'd like to suggest more packing be put in the box since the radiator is somewhat fragile. I, personally, had no problems due to packaging, but others could.UPDATE: Now that I've used this device for a couple of seasons, I've got to say that it's a terrific buy. Oil-cooled engines run so hot and this cooler takes the edge off it for greater durability of the engine. I designed a deflector shield to take the air-flow across the oil filter and past the muffler heat to further cool the engine on my Cub Cadet Garden Tractor. This is an inexpensive cure for a case of the hots. Kohler thought it was a necessary item or they wouldn't offer it."
3,Review of Children's Educational software,"The product is fine but I would have expected it to come in a box, like the ones I saw in the local store."
4,Authentic Spanish Tapas,"I am charging this lovely book with 1 star for it's extreme focus on cocktails (about 1/2 the book)that you can find in any cocktail book! Manhattan, Mint Julep, Old Fashioned, Rob Roy, Rusty Nail, Whiskey sour, and the list goes on, are neither unique nor relevant to the main subject, Tapas. To me it is obvious that the first 83 pages of this book are just a filler to justify the price.Having said that the rest of the book is excellent. Recipes are separated into categories of Tapas by main ingredient, photos for many of the selections, as well as some history on the dishes.Despite the annoying cocktail section this is still the best Tapas book I have come accross."
1,useless in practice,"This book requires a huge number of ingredients that are simply impossible to locate. I live in Los Angeles, and scoured specialty shops, Whole Foods, the regular chains, and the Latin markets- coming up prohibitively empty each time.Unless you live in the area and know where to find exceptionally random ingredients, this book is nothing more than a bound bunch of pretty photos.Essentially, the book is useless."
2,This is a cocktail how to book,"This book is more about cocktails and less about tapas. I was hoping for an interesting tapas, not so. Beware"
3,Wonderful but tricky,"I have used this DC adapter successfully on United, other airlines for 5 years running now. And with 2-3 different laptops over this period. It has been great. UNTIL, the tip fell off in the dark light of a plane, and I put it back on reversed. Then it blew out my laptop motherboard regulator. The modularity of adapter tips is stunning, great, but be very careful with the tip polarity.It put this in the middle of my stars because it is great but can create damage easily."
1,Not a great book on its own.,"I found myself reviewing the details of other books checked out from the library (Timoshenko 1956, Seely and Smith 1952, Boresi 2003, and Hibbeler 2003) often hidden in this text just to do the exercise. Furthermore, a lot of examples were the same as those from other textbooks but with much less clarity here. The diagrams were often confusing and the details showing the development of the theory were often highly masked or left out completely. On a positive note (if there is actually one), the book will probably be used later for reference, because, after struggling through the minute details and solving the problems posed here, I have a better understanding of the principles, but definitely NOT because of this book or the professor who used it almost exclusively to teach the course!"
2,An elementary comprehensive treatment of applied elasticity,"This book covers the elementary topic of mechanics of material (stress-strain relations, etc.) and more advanced applied topics (thin plate & shell, energy method, etc.). The elementary topics are well organized and easy to understand, but the more advanced topics are not enough, especially on plate and shell theory."
1,Makes things look difficult,"The book makes things look difficult, but I'm pretty sure they are not that difficult. One of the worst books I have had so far. The book does not explain theories in a good way, and no examples after every section to help you understand the material."
1,terrible.,"This book is by far the worst textbook I have ever used. The author does not present ideas logically or coherently. Many explanations, despite being unnecessarily wordy, are vague.I had already covered failure criteria (chapter 4) in another class but still found myself confused due to the author's poor writing style -- thankfully, I still had my old notes.If you are a professor looking for a textbook for your class, please DO NOT use this book. I actually purchased another book on elasticity because this one is so awful."
2,Not Practical,"As an Aerospace Engineer (structures), I found this to be the one book that remains on my shelf. It has valid and accurate ACEDEMIC explanations of structural systems - but it does not lend itself to practical implementation of those methods...and many other books do! If this book is supplementing a curriculum, it will serve its purpose well. However, if you actually plan to use what you've learned - not here.For a book that fits the requirements of application, please refer to ""Practical Sress Analysis for Design Engineers"", Flabel (ISBN 0-9647014-0-5)"
4,Works well for car doors,"Works very well for screeching car doors or trunk, or any metal-to-metal friction. A little goes a long way, and while the product is good there really should be an applicator tip. The nozzle is blunt and rather broad, so you can either apply it neatly using a tool or try to squeeze out a lump and flick it into the right place. You can guess which method I opted for, but it was effective regardless."
4,Rating 3- A little bit of Jimmy Witherspoon,"I thought the cost of the dvd was excessive for the entertainment received. It was short, only fair quality & not enough songs for the money."
3,"Praxis study guide, more info needed","The guide provides lists of all the topics that you will be tested on but does not provide explanations of the terms and topics. I had to spend cosiderable time on my own researching the information needed. It would have been helpful if some of this was included in the guide. However, the practice questions were very helpful as were the explanations of the right answers."
2,Nothing like the actual test,"This study guide just gives you the format of the exam. As far as the material on the exam, this study guide is no good."
2,necessary but not overly helpful,This book is necessary for anyone preparing for this exam to get an idea of the format and the type of questions included. There is almost no explanation for the answers on the practice questions however.
2,0146 takers,"I was disappointed with this book. I took the praxis ii test 0146 Middle School Content Knowledge. The math review was a complete misrepresentation of what was actually on the test. As for the other subjects, the book is basically an outline describing all the things to study, but you will need many more resources beyond this book to really study. The practice questions are a little helpful but only a handful of the study questions were on the actual test. I only remember one for sure.If you want an outline of what to study, this is the book for you, but it won't help you pass the test."
3,Not what I thought...,"This study guide only offers an overview of what the test covers. Anyone who is taking the test knows this already. I was hoping it would give more information on the topics covered so I wouldn't have to research the topics myself. The practice test was helpful because after scoring, you can see what areas are weak."
1,Do not waste your money!,"This is by far the worst ""study guide"" I've ever used. There are lists of what is on the test and practice tests. It does not cover any material to help you study/learn. So if you are coming into the test, knowing how to/remembering your middle school math class material, middle school science material, middle school english material, and middle school social studies material...you will be okay..however, if you don't know/remember the material, my advice to you is to buy a different book!"
2,Disappointed and got what I paid for,Superficial book that gives limited insight into how to successfully manage the Praxis test-taking process for middle school subjects. The book offers only one shortened test version for each subject area. I bought the item used and was very disappointed to find that ALL practice tests had been solved in ink/highliter marker by a previous reader. Not worth the $7 spent.
3,too general for my tastes,"I bought this book for the math Praxis test, and did not realize the book covered all the middle school tests. I am not a teacher, but hoped to pass the math test. There was only one math test, most of which was covered in the Praxis web site. So this book was not very useful to me, but could be for someone wanting an overview of middle school Praxis tests."
2,not very pleased,"I was not very pleased with this purchase. It is good as far as giving you topics to study, but no specific information about the topics. Who has time to google every topic. Certainly not anyone I know. I would not recommend this book. I ended up borrowing textbooks from a middle school student which was a LOT more help than this book."
1,Waste of money !,"Books written by the company that write the tests are worthless. Trust me....I read bad reviews on these books prior to purchasing them and bought them anyway. Once I got them, I soon realized they were of no help in preparing me study for the Praxis Exams. Barron's provides the best source of materials for study for the Praxis Exams. Do not waste your money on these books."
4,Great Study Starter,"This book was a great study starter for the Middle School Content and Knowledge test. I went through the topics, then researched on the internet the things I was not sure of. One thing to be aware of....the Social Studies is NOT history. It is mostly Sociology. All in all, this is a good book to prepare one for the praxis."
2,Not reccomended for primary study guide,"I bought this book for $40 simply because it is made by the same people who make the praxis II test (also, becasue there are not too many other study guides for the 0089 test). The pluss side of the book is that it contains a 60 question practice test with answers. Seeing as how these are the same people who make the questions for the praxis test, you can be pretty certain that if you do well on the practice test. The problem with this book is that, while it tells you what you need to study for the test, it does not give you any information on the things that it tells you to study. It just says things like ""Study ancient empires and civilizations,"" but it doesn't give you any information on it. For this reason, I do not reccomend buying this book. I don't think that it's worth $40 just for the practice test."
2,liked old recipe better,"tHEY DON'T TASTE GOOD ANYMORE SINCE THE RECIPE was changed. And I bought a BUNCH that I have to eat, anyway.Will be looking for another low fat/hi protein crunchy snack... GREAT customer service, though - so, nocomplaints there. Thanks"
4,"Life goes on, no matter what.",This volume covers a period (1754 - 1760) skipped over in the earlier book about the strife during the War concerning the New York plantation near the Hudson River and two men brought up there as brothers. The descriptions of Colonial life makes one wonder how they endured such hardships in this New World.There is more emphasis on politics just touched on in CITY OF DREAMS. The 'complexity' of history makes it worth reading; she researches her material minutely to the best effect. She not only presents the historical facts but her use of the English language is impeccable.
5,Perfect mix of historical interest and story telling,"Having read and absolutely loved City of Dreams, I was anxious to get my hands on Shadowbrook the minute I could and I had it preordered on Amazon as a result. I was not disapointed in any way, yet again Ms Swerling has made the perfect mix of historical research and interest with a blinding story this time of the sultry south. I have a fascination with the historical aspects of her books, always so interesting and with so much detail that you really lose yourself in the time and place. But unlike equally well researched books with an interesting factual basis like the Di Vinci code, Ms Swerling's charaters are living breathing believable human beings and she spins a yarn that keeps you hooked throughout. I really recommend this book to anyone interested in recent history and/or who enjoys a compulsive story line. I also recommend City of Dreams to any who haven't read that yet either."
2,Sorry - it's not very good,"I heard an interview on NPR and it sounded interesting and I picked it up at the airport bookstore before a flight yesterday.First problem - it's short. It took exactly 90 minutes to read - I could have easily bought a magazine that provided a longer period of entertainment.Second - it's depressing.Third - It's just not very engaging - the characters are shallow - the life stories are brief - It seemed gimmicky - I read it yesterday, and I've forgotten most of it today.This guy is supposed to be a great writer. He obviously can compose sentences well, but if this is his best effort, I'm not impressed.It reads like a bulleted Powerpoint Presentation"
2,Supremely Disappointing,"This is a prize-winning book? If it were written by anyone but Phillip Roth it would have been dismissed for what it is - a depressing, unresolved, boring story about a narcissistic man with nothing going on in his life. Think of how boring it is when someone goes on and on and on about their various medical conditions and operations -- well about half of this skimpy book consists of just that.I'm 61 and if this is what I have to look forward to in the twilight of my life, bring on the arsenic."
2,Everyman? I hope not.,"The title makes nos sense, the story well crafted might interest writers but moves ever so slow and seems to go down hill all the way to the end. The most likeable characters seem those who die out early like his father. But the main character is a sad case of one with gifts that he never appreciated or acknowledged. This is a depressing story, a hard story to tell and the author is to be congratualted for being so skilled in telling it. But I wish I had spent the time reading something else beside a well told unredeeming tale."
4,A Gentler Roth,"This small novel share many of the characteristics of Roth's work.The existential view of life, the fear of and inevitability of death,sexual passions as life affirming but also destructive when not controlled and the narcisstic protagonist are all present.YET there are loving relationships, an ex wife, a daughter, a brother, and parents which are felt as important and life affirming if still ambivilant. Also and I think of importance is the more caring and kinder view of family and origins i.e Jewish roots. We have a less angry and maybe more compassionate Roth.A Terdiman"
3,Fan of PR,"I have read almost everything written by this author. Everyman is definitely not his best! It has some good and even amusing moments though. I cannot recommend it as anything but a ""niche"" read. It's morbid and rather unappealing. However, if you can resonate with Philip Roth's kind of lonely guy character, this book may be for you."
4,good writing,"Interesting book for introspective types who enjoy a soul-searching perspective on a life filled with regret and disappointment. Good, provocative writing."
4,Thought-Provoking Look at Mortality,"I loved the perspective and the focus of the book, the look at our decline in old age. Some of the story was beguiling and the protagonist's antics were not real, but the narrative was fabulous in general."
4,The ending makes it worth it.,"As you know, if you've been reading the reviews, this is part of the Nemisis series of books that addresses death in its various forms. Of the four novels that compose the series, this is my second least favorite--as it is very, very, dark and depressing. The ending of Roth's books, particularly in this series, are what make reading his books worth it. You get the sense that instead of reading a story, you've just witness a small portion of someone's life, as depicted in vivid color on a canvas. The characters are amazingly real, the story true to life with all of its gritty depth and darkness, along with the dizzying heights of joy and happiness. That's why I read Philip Roth, and why I would recommend this book. Everyman is about as close to a piece of art, as any book could be, and its the kind of art that will make you think about it, long after you finish the last sentance."
1,Total disappointment.,"I read Philip Roth's American Pastoral and was encouraged enough to order another Philip Roth book. Big mistake. I found Everyman to be a complete waste of time. I actually lost my place and read 100 pages over the second time without realizing it. This book is not well-written and the storyline is ridiculous. If this is what Philip Roth has to tell us at the end of a long life, I'm so sad for him. The vision of this old man chasing around a young girl and taking no more thought for what he's doing to the people around him, seems more appropriate teenage behavior. I was disgusted. It was my second and last Philip Roth book. We have much better writers in the USA, I can't imagine why this man is so famous."
2,depressing,"Philip Roth's new book was no more than therantings of a old man who felt he threw mostof his life away on frivolous woman chasing.It was very sad, I didn't feel sorry for thecharacter, only that I agreed with hisanalysis. I don't recommend the book onany level."
3,Everyman by Philip Roth,Contrary to reviews I read in a recent NYT book review this is not one of the greaat works of American literature. It is fairly banal.
2,Don't bother!,"I feel terrible about not being able to finish a book that is only 182 pages long, but it is just too boring. Roth states that the scene in the original play - when Everyman tells Death that he arrived when he was least expected - was the inspiration for writing this book. Well, at the risk of sounding condescending, can anyone really be impressed with such an overwhelmingly obvious observation? Who else but Philip Roth could get away with publishing a novel with an unnamed hero that is little more than a grocery list of all the operations this guy ever had? Roth's weaknesses as a writer - his self-indulgence and self-centeredness - stand alone in this book, without any of the saving graces that can be found in some of his other works - such as story, character, and insight. I'm afraid the positive reviews of this book are just cases of readers not realizing that the emperor wears no clothes."
5,Aging Process is a Massacre,"I am around old, sick people a lot - both in my job and in my family. Some of them are on an unbelievable number of medications - both prescription and non-prescription - often pain meds and antidepressants thrown in. The ones that do better are the ones in better health and those that manage a good attitude, but none are exempt. If they have enough descendants, they probably have a certain amount of emotional angst to deal with as well - the disappointment of unnecessary estrangements and poor choices stacked on top of the relentless aging process. The book is a bit of a downer, but realistic. Roth puts it this way - ""Old age isn't a battle; Old age is a massacre"" - well worth reading."
4,fantastic,"roth rules. that dude can write a mean sentence. i'll save you from the praise you can read in the other 118 reviews for this title and i'll get straight to my issue, which is fully technical: THE WORDS ARE TOO LOUD. seriously, my edition of this book is in 12-point type which is great for the sight impaired but awful for the rest of us. gimme the squint-inducing haruki murakami-style 8-point joint any day. yeah, this is picking nits but the gargantuan font size rendered this fabulous book almost totally unreadable. woulda been a shame."
4,kill yourself before you get really old,"Philip Roth is not going to be offered a job as the PR director of an assisted living facility. This novel will inspire anyone over the age of 65 whose health is failing to kill him- or herself right now. He makes the final 5-10 years of life sound so painful that nobody would voluntarily do it if they went in with full knowledge of the hospitalizations, the pain, the drugs, the isolation. Professionally crafted as you'd expect, but don't give this one as a gift to anyone worried about getting older."
3,Slim but satisfying,"I wouldn't agree with one of the reviewers that there's nothing to this book. This book isn't so much about death or the expectation of death as much as the diminishment of life. Authors sometimes write about courage or about cowardice, but rarely does anyone get into the skin of someone who is slowly losing their capacity to function as a result of old age. The strategy Roth employs to tell this story is short, spare, and leaves some material necessarily vague. The narcissitic main character doesn't care about his sons, loses interest in his wives, alienates himself from his brother, and all over health. Anyone who has seen this sort of thing happen in real life knows how valuable a work like this can be. And all told in Roth's distinctive voice."
3,It's Life,"I wavered on how many stars to give this...do I rate it on its literary appeal or subject matter or both? This is the first book I've read by Mr. Roth. Undoubtedly he is a good writer. He way of expressing feelings and other intangibles is very good. However, from a real world point of view, what a sad but true commentary on living a life without hope. Unfortunately the main character views himself as just like every other man. He does what he wants based on his desires alone. And he pays the high cost for that. In the end he knows he faces certain oblivion...or the oblivion of unbelief. This may be a true assessment of the current state of society. Live for today for tomorrow you die. But to those of us who believe in God and an eternity either with Him or without Him, this short story declares what we already know and what the writer of Eclesiates declares...all life is vanity without knowing God."
2,I must be missing something....,"A great work of literature has atmosphere, insight, or unique style. Or all three. I dropped EVERYMAN half way through. Unremarkable narrative, sounds like your uncles long winded story at a family gathering. Didnt do anything for me."
3,On ageing and accountability,"A realistic - at times candid - look at mortality from a thrice married man, who, at the tail-end of his increasingly frail life, assesses his failures.Roth presents his protagonist in a sympathetic light, which at times arouses the reader's annoyance with his self-pity and attempts to explain away his philandering ways...However, the writing is tight and sustains the reader's interest throughout."
2,"some good, some bazarre","There is some good information to glean from this book, however, especially in the latter chapters, there is much that is contrary to my Christian world view. The author may be more in tune to the spiritual realm than the medical/scientific community, as a whole, but his solutions go against the One who wrote the instruction manual and has the Ultimate Solution. I found a couple of the latter chapters interesting and informative of another's beliefs, and the author brings awareness that there is more to human beings than just the physical/scientific realm, but we differ in how it is to be addressed."
3,Was hoping it would have a plan of action,"While seemingly well researched and informative, it was vague regarding a plan of action, though the author did a good job. This book was more set up to provide a compilation of different avenues to try and/or pick and choose from rather than setting forth a plan or providing guidance for formulating a plan. I have since been reading about omega 3 and bipolar. I am trying that."
5,Advanced beyond current theory,This book is packed with theory that was and is beyond the times. Probably hands down the best book on ego psychology and therapeutic justification/technique there is.
4,Every Picture Tells a Story,"Even casual readers about the U.S. Civil War have seen the haunting images of young soldiers staring stiffly into thecamera for posterity. About to embark into a war of unimagined horror, few of their particular stories were preserved or documented. ""Faces of the Civil War"" takes those personal mementos and visiting cards as a hook to pull the reader into many previously untold stories. This winning combination of powerful images, extensive archival research, and accessible journalistic writing provides a welcome addition to anyone's Civil War book collection. It also can grab and hold student's interest in this endlessly fascinating era of U.S. history."
3,Product Came Dented,"The product is what it says it is, although the bottle looks different than the picture. The box was dented and so was the bottle when it came, a small amount of leakage in the package, but nothing worth returning or not purchasing again. Just would be nice if it was packaged a little better. This could have been a UPS issue as well."
3,the game is difficult and you can't backtrack if you miss something so remember to go forward cautiously with your evidence,A very challenging game good for the amateur sleuth to sharpen their forensic evidence collection methods. Don't get frustrated it can be solved it just takes a lot of attention to detail.
3,csi three dimensions of murder,"love csi, not crazy about the game. not very difficult. finished all cases relatively quickly. nancy drew mysteries were harder to solve. please come out with something more challenging!"
3,"Same as previous CSI games, just different faces","I was a little disappointed in the new CSI game. It really hasn't changed much at all from the previous versions. You have the same tools, same scenerios, same everything. The first CSI game was fun, the second one a little repetitive. This one is downright boring if you've played the other two.If you haven't played the previous CSI games, you would probably enjoy this game. It has good graphics. It is a little too easy thoguh."
5,CSI: 3 Dimensions of Murder,I knew exactly what my daughter wanted from her Amazon wish list. The product shipped fast and was exactly what she wanted.
4,Makes me feel like a CSI,"I love this game. I love all the CSI games, and although they're short, and must be savored, because one could easily finish a game in a weekend, I haven't found many PC games that hold my interest this well. I love them for their adult content. I love processing evidence. And no, sometimes the voices don't sound exactly like thier TV characters, but I don't find that this takes away from the gameplay at all. Another game or two to try: Black Mirror, or Sanitarium."
5,Fun and Challenging,"CSI games are fun and challenging and if you get stuck at some point it is easy to find a hint online which I had to do once in awhile. I story lines of the episodes are all good and I had a lot of fun solving them. I have about 10 CSI game DVDs and this one is just like the rest, Great. The price is cheap and it will give someone hours of fun."
4,I'm the CSI,"I really enjoy the TV show so the game is terrific. I admit I'm not the best player, so it will entertain me for months."
2,Barely makin it,"Although the game itself is awesome, it doesn't play well on my PC. I've had to purchase a new video card just to play it and my PC just isn't as up to date (2 yrs old!) as it needs to be since the makers of the game have made it for newer PC's and obviously to heck with the others.Had I known prior to purchasing I would not have purchased this game.Not all the people that purchase these games are also able to spend hundreds of dollars for newer PC's just to play.Very disappointed with overall performance and the step up in computer software/hardware necessary just to play.I believe in advancing technology, but this is a game....meant to be fun....not expense after expense after expense just to play.Very sorry I paid so much for something I can't use."
3,CANDY- HEATH LEDGER,"I ordered this movie after Heath's death because I had not seen it and could not find it anywhere. I was shocked throughout most of the movie. It is soley about drug use and death. Don't get me wrong, the acting is very good, but the language is very crude and most of the scenes are very graphic. After I had watched it, I had kind of wished I hadn't. I doubt I will ever watch it again. For those of you who are avid Ledger fans, I'm not sure you would want to see this, after every thing that has happened."
1,Hated it,"I could not make it past the first half hour of it because it was so graphic and seemed to just be going in an endless circle/cycle! I hated every second of it and should have turned it off way sooner, but I just love Heath Ledger so I tried to get through it. It was awful!!"
2,Just OK,"I read the book first and, as usual, it was not as good as the book. If you are a Heath Ledger fan or have a background in addiction, you may enjoy the movie but otherwise - there are better movies to spend your money on. Rent it before you buy it."
4,What a pleasant surprise this movie was,"I came across Candy at my local video club because they made a special display for the H Ledger movies. We all have seen 10 Things I Hate About You and Brokeback so, although Brokeback its a good movie, my expectations were kinda low. But this movie really got me going because of the perfomances of the leading actors and also because it looks realistic and crude. Geoffrey Rush is a bonus and adds to the reality of what the drugs world is. It was maybe too long or too slowpased sometimes but very good overall. Don't miss it!"
3,Book vs Movie,"I might have made a mistake in reading the book first. Heath Ledger and Abbie Cornish do a fantastic job in this film, but the characters and the sences were not as developed as they were in the book, obvioulsy. There was so much more that I kept waiting for that never came from the movie. Things from the book that I thought would be important to the story, that couldn't fit in the 108 minutes. I definately recommend the book over watching the movie.Candy: A Novel of Love and Addiction"
4,ATTENTION ASPIRING FASHION DESIGNERS!,"I purchased ""Make It Your Own"" today and am really satisfied with it. This book doesn't teach you to design patterns - it teaches you how to modify them! It includes ideas (and the instructions to create the patterns for these ideas) such as altering necklines and collars, adding drawstrings and overlays, creating asymmetrical closures, button-on accessories and lots more. My favorite was the petal sleeve which you could add on to a regular sleeveless shirt. I also liked the bell cuffs and belt closures. (Remember - you can work these ideas into any pattern or add them onto a garment you already own!) Finally, this book includes ideas to open up your creativity and ""inner child"". It also has helpful hints on where to find ideas for your designs. Recommended for anyone who's sick of the ""cookie-cutter clothes"" most patterns create."
5,Highly Recommended,This book is excellent for even the most untalented of sewers who desires to add her own embellishments to a pattern.
5,Very Satisfied,"I am very satisfied with this product. I have very dry, sensitive, and reactive skin and have suffered from adult acne for close to 8 years. Because my skin gets dried out so easily I use this wash once a day (evening) and use the toner twice a day (morning and evening). I no longer use medication for my skin. This wash works very well, is gentle, and is quite affordable."
5,Buy quality,"Rule number 1 through 10 in cooking is don't cheap out on knifes. You hurt yourself more often on a low quality knife because you try harder and that results in cuts on your hands. I bought a set about 1 1/2 years ago and came back to get these additions. What a great product, quality is obvious when you pick it up. Use it a few times and you'll wonder why you ever bought cheap knives."
5,Awesome knife,This is the perfect knife for slicing and dicing fruits and veggies. It is easy to keep sharp and has good balance. Highly recommended!
4,good overview for a newbie,"Not having heard much of eminems work before getting this CD, I thought this was a great primer. Pretty solid all the way thru."
4,Limited on the SD/Multimedia Card,"I bought one last week and I love it, but one word to the wise. The camera is not compatible with a 128mb card. The camera can't read pictures you take using a 128mb media card. This means you have to drop down to a 64mb card. You still get 120+ pictures on the 64, but its something you might want to know."
4,Very comfy but slight pinch at toes,"Havianas are the most comfortable flip flop. These are great as well especially for the price I paid. The only slight discomfort is that there is a bit of a pinch in between my left toes. Other than that, buy em!"
5,Skeptical on trying out rubber flip flop - So glad I did!,"When I first tried on these flip flops in a store, I liked them. I've never liked rubber flip flops before. For my birthday I bought them in 4 colors and was worried that I over did it ... until I went to Disney World and wore them, and now I can definitely say these are fantastic flip flops! Soft and comfortable, and the strap doesn't rub at all since it is rounded on the underside of the strap. I thought maybe the part between your toes would be too thick, but it fits perfectly. I even got my mom to try a pair, and she hates flip flops. I highly recommend these!"
5,Perfect!,"I have lived and died in these all summer, not the best support for long hours of walking, but I managed to walk for six hours in NY without a blister, so that says a lot. Perfect colour, slimline makes them look more feminine, I just Love them and think every girl should have a pair of these in whatever colour suits them best!"
2,Nothing like the comfort of the origonal Havs Tops line,"These get two stars for comfort, five stars for cuteness. I like the slimmer shape, straps, and adorable designs, but why they can't do all that and KEEP THE LEGENDARY SQUISHY COMFORT of the old Tops, I just cannot understand.So, back to the plain Tops for me. The Slims are just a bit more comfortable than ordinary thongs but not nearly enough to justify the price and certainly not worthy of the Havaianas name."
4,Not as radically different as I expected for the price.,"These are simply regular old flip flops in my view--not really worth the high price. Still I have had other flip flops that felt like I was walking on cardboard and then some that were so squishy they eventually flattened out! So, maybe there is something to these. The main reason I gave four stars is because these actually fit me! I wear a size 6 and my foot is narrow. I always end up with shoes that are medium and so that means a lot of extra shoe showing around my foot. Will I buy another pair? Yep! These fit! Just think they could be a bit cheaper. I do like the smooth part that goes between the toes too. Maybe I should change to 5 stars? No, I still think they should be cheaper."
3,Just OK,"Really, I don't know what all the hype is about, other than the fact that they are really cute. I found that on the part that goes in between your toes the molded plastic had some sharp edges and I had to trim some of it off to avoid blisters. These flip flops are a tad narrow, which I like, so there's not a lot of visible footbed around my foot. They have been very durable this summer, but they're not any more comfy than regular cheapo flip flops. When people say they're the most comfortable flip flops ever, they clearly haven't owned many flip flops. For example, they don't come close to the ultra cushy Teva Mush flip flops (these are like walking on clouds! divine!). I've enjoyed them this summer, but to be honest I wouldn't buy them again."
3,Not like my other Havaianas,I received my first pair of Havaianas direct from Brazil and fell in love with them! Super comfortable for a flip flop and fit really well. I wanted to buy another pair since I loved this first pair so much so I began my internet search. My first mistake was buying the 'slim' ones which I didn't realize I had done. This pair isn't as thick on the bottom (which might be part of the slim design) but the worst part for me is that they seemed to have stretched out already - my foot slides out from the toe piece.
1,Sent Wrong Color Combo.,"I purchased the dark brown Havaianas Flip Flops--dark brown, non-patterned bottom and dark brown Y-shaped strap (or thong). Instead, I received the patterned bottom with light brown Y-strap (or thong) model.I'm very unhappy with this, but can't return the product since my other pair of flip flops are broken. The product itself is fine--not damaged or dysfunctional--but it's NOT what I ordered. I think the seller should rectify this in some way."
4,GOOD,"when i got these flip flops i opened the box and there was a small gray scratch on one of them but these are just my pool flip flops so i didn't care much. when it says ""slim"" its referring to the strap which is good for me because i have a very high in-step and the strap is very flexible."
2,Item was a full size smaller than actual size,I ordered a 35/36. I own multiple havaianas of that size. Item arrived labeled 35/36 but it was a full size smaller and did not fit. It left me wondering if it was a defective batch or a knock off.
4,Not as nice as the Top Flip Flop from Havaianas,"If given the choice, I would pick the regular Havaianas over the Slim version. Much more cushion, and better styles to choose from. I have longer, skinny feet, and the Slims just seem to make them seem longer and more skinny. However, they are still Havaianas, and have held up well for the use that they have seen for the past year and a half."
5,so comfy,"This is made out of rubber, not styrofoam like some other cheap ones.So it's very comfy and also safer then styrofoam ones"
1,Wrong size conversion in online chart and on the shoes,"The sizes are just wrong....wrong, wrong, wrong. I ordered a US 5-6 and the shoe that arrived was marked US 4-5 with some wacky conversions into Brazil/Euro sizes. (Every shoe conversion chart I've found renders their information senseless.) Be prepared to exchange it. Luckily, friendly return policies apply."
1,Like burning your money,I purchased 3 pairs of Havaianas for myself and kids. All 3 of them fell apart after 1 month of light use. I emailed customer service and they wouldn't replace them.Good looking sandals but made with horrible material and process in China. Complete garbage!
3,tiny straps,"the straps are too tiny; it kinda hurts to walk over long distances (ie 15 mins). But the cushioning is great like all havaianas. If I had a choice, I would buy a different brand, the hurt is not worth it."
2,Wrong Size,Ordered 2 pair of size 9--one was the right size one size 5.??? I live in Canada so returning them is not a viable option. The shoes are great but the people filling the orders need to sharpen up.
2,Painful.,"I bought 3 pairs (black, grey and navy). The size was right, having narrow feet...these fit me like a dream. I wore the grey out for a day and noticed my feet were hurting. I dismissed it, telling myself that they just needed to be broken in. When I finally did sit down to check my feet, I had two bloody slash marks where the plastic/rubber thong part went between my toes. I took the shoe off to take a closer look and the underside of the thong is a non-finished, rough surface. I took a nail buffer and filed them down but honestly, for price of these flip flops, they should need no ""modifications"" just to be wearable. I won't be buying more of these."
2,Not Worth The Hype,"These flip flops are not worth the hype of the name!I have purchased $5.00 flip flops that were better.There are several problems with these shoes:1. The ""white"" ones are really pearl or off white2. They are very narrow and don't fit the average foot3. The sizing information is wrong(I had to order them twice and the wrong size came both times!"
5,Good practice,This is a good practice workbook to reinforce Algebra skills. Each section has detailed examples followed by practice problems.
1,Right back to the Store,"Had really high hopes for this unit - Tivo capabilities with no monthly cost - consolidating digital pictures and Mp3 files - great concept for an all in one device. One catch - It won't work with DirectTV. Customer Service was laughable. Wait this one out guys, I can only assume the next generation with get some of the bugs out."
2,Needs a lot of improvement,"My issues:- I also get errors when trying to record with unhelpful messages- Having it switch channels on my cable box doesn't always work (doesn't always enter all the numbers)- It won't let me enter most 3-digit channel numbers- Crashed on me twice so far. Unit still had clock working, but won't turn on & status light off. Unplug/Replug to work again.- No support on website for this product yet- Limited naming convention on recorded shows (i.e. can't specify caps where I want them, names have to be very short).- Opening/Closing DVD drawer takes you to menu (i.e. can't put movie in to watch later without disrupting what you're watching).- Can't record show on one channel & still watch anotherWhen it does record, it works great.Am hoping for some sort of firmware update(s) to fix these issues"
1,4th one and still not a good one,"I think the title about says it all. I read many reviews before I bought, and I agree about the lousy remote and slow channel switch time. I could overlook all of that if the damn thing would just work.The 1st one wouldn't let me delete a program I had recorded. RCA said ""you can either live with it, or we can send you a new one"". Live with it? They have no master reset or deltree type of command to reset these things. #2 worked for about 30 minutes then everything went green and stayed green. #3 wouldn't play my recorded DVD's where the 1st would. Now #4 has a recorded show ""stuck"" on the hard drive just like #1.In addition to all of this every one of them has to be unplugged to ""reset"" them every couple of weeks because it will start getting ""unknown error"" messages when you try to record a show.Be warned...........1 OK, 2 getting bad, 3 you must be joking, 4 take this piece of junk away!"
3,Would you like to be an elf?,"Would you like to be an elf and save your folk? This epic adventure around the land of the elves. It includes history, lore, legendary heroes, and a quest beyond the magical Silvanesti Shield."
1,Mislabled Item,This item is mislabled. If you look at the Nature Made website you will see that they do not make a product with this name. I didnt notice this until I ordered it and got the wronng item. What you get is the non-natural version of E+CoQ10. This means that the vitamin E that you are getting is the dl-Alpha version and not the d-Alpha version that comes with the natural products.
1,entire premise of book is made up science,"I was very disappointed in a much-celebrated, Nobel prize winning author who didn't do her homework. First of all, the main character, Paul, has 'papillary carcinoma, the worst kind of thyroid cancer.' Except that papillary thyroid cancer is actually the LEAST deadly kind of cancer, of all the cancers out there. It has a nearly 100% cure rate is people under age 60. I had this type of cancer 13 years ago, and have never even required a hospital stay after one of my radiation treatments. So to build the entire premise of the novel around his needed isolation is based on made up science. And if he's such a danger to his family, why is he out of the hospital and living with his parents and the housekeeper? I couldn't get past the first chapter of this book because the complete lack of accuracy was too infurriating to me."
3,Video Door Bell,Works pretty well in normal light. Sunlight entering porch area causes a glare making it impossible to see. Camera can not be adjusted. Points straight ahead so it is easy for the visitor to move out of field of view. My intercom didn't work either.
5,My child loves this CD,"I'll be honest. This CD is not my favorite. But my 3-year-old LOVES it. LOVES LOVES LOVES it--because throughout the whole CD, JLC talks to her. For her, the narration is perfect. The tone is perfect. The content is perfect. And she loves that JLC asks her questions and tells her stories.For that reason, I highly recommend it."
1,"Boring, boring, boring...","I bought the book ""it's hard to be five..."" because the book was describing my own son...this book is great,full of real life scenarios for a 5 years old boy. Then I saw ""The jamie Lee Curtis Audio collection"" and I thought: It should be good and great...Huge mistake!First of all...Mrs.Curtis narration is B-O-R-I-N-G Boring, boring, boring.She just can helped it. I did not like it at all. All the tracks on this CD are very bad narrated but the worst part is when she is reciting ""When I was little"" her voice is lifeless,dull, very very emotionless and of course.. not interesting for little ones. She should listen ""The cat on the hat audio collection"" By Dr Seuss in order to get an idea about what exactly is to be working having on mind little ears.I wish I could get my money back!!!!!"
1,Don't Bother!,Don't waste your time with this product. I had used a similar pumice stone/sponge product before but never where the packaging contents where stuck to the product itself. I was able to remove some of the plastic but it become unbearable. It's a waste of time and money. I bought this product because of the price since many pumice stones are ridiculously overpriced but I've learned that paying a few extra cents can pay off.
4,Terrific selection of songs,"I remember getting this collection delivered to me on Christmas Eve in 1994. It's been a favorite of mine since. Over 20 selections, my favorites are:Grown Up Christmas List - Natalie ColeLouisiana Christmas Day - Aaron NevilleEmmanuel - Amy GrantLet's Make a Baby King - WynonnaMerry Christmas Oh Happy Day - CommodoresAngels We Have Heard on High - Michael W. SmithSilent Night - Boys II MenMary Had a Baby/Go Tell it on the Mountain - Vanessa WilliamsA nice selection of pop, country and R&B; music for the holidays. The last three songs listed above are GREAT. If you can find this CD, grab it."
4,"Nice Christmas album, better than Christmas in Nashville","Steve Vaus and other popular musicalartist do a Christmas album well, withsongs for the whole family. No turkeyshere. Pick Up On It!"
4,Just good book,"Among many psychic development workbooks, Discover Your Psychic Powers is one of the better publications available. On over 400 pages is explains everything that psychic ""wannabe"" should know - including both theory and practical exercises. As any psychic development guidebook, ""Discover..."" won't turn you into psychic, but if you will follow the guidelines within this book, you will turn into psychic yourself."
5,An excellent beginner's guide,"This book's wonderful clear, color photos make this book an excellent guide for beginners or casual wildflower observers."
4,Very interesting CD,"Although this CD was very expensive I am still glad that I bought it because it is worth the money. Anyone who loves music that is different and better that the junk that is popular today should own this CD. The musical arrangements are different than anything that I have heard in a long time. This is really beautiful music, especially the title song ""paradise."" To me this is really a ""must have"" collection of music if you can get it."
3,Odds and Ends but Very Enjoyable,"Andrew Gold ... one of my favorite artists/writers ... this release is, as the title suggests, ""Leftovers"" or unreleased, perhaps not fully realized songs ... however, for Gold, Leftovers are better than many fresh cooked offerings from current artists ... Andrew's sense of humor is in full force here ... between each song, there are original Phone Message Greetings ... not sure if they are real, but they sure are funny ... I thought this would be annoying but it is actually rather fun ... Andrew Gold was so gifted but he remained humble and never took himself too seriously ... he will be greatly missed ... check out some of his other titles as well ..."
2,Obsolete,"It might have been the epitome of UNIX development, now it's nearly twenty years old. It didn't age well. Get Stevens (0201563177) if you want something serious about programming, or just ask Google."
5,Understand the logic of UNIX.,"Ive learned UNIX on my home p.c with LINUX, Coming from WinNT envrioment i didnt know a thing About the UNIX operating system, this book helped Me understand the simplicity and logic behind UNIX And how to use my programming skills on a Diffrent, better operating system. I recommend this book storngly to every Novice/Advanced/user/programmer that wants to Learn UNIX the right way."
5,The manual for caregivers - you are not alone,"With plenty of books from doctors and sufferers of eating disorders on the market, one of the areas that has been missing is how families cope with loved ones with those disorders. The Starving Family fills that gap by sharing the insights of various caregivers. Eating disorders or any other kind of similar problem does not occur in isolation. It affects and involves everyone who cares for or about the individual. Educational, insightful, and full of encouraging advice for those dealing with this problem The Starving Family is highly recommended."
4,Helpful,"I think this book would be quite helpful for families in the early stages of dealing with an eating disorder. By the time I read it we had been dealing with it for quite some time, so much of the information I had already found out. However, still worth a read. Presents things from the family's point of view which is good as most books take it from the patients perspective."
2,Jhaeman's Review,"Since I'm getting ready to direct my first session of Call of Cthulhu on Saturday, I thought I'd rent a couple of DVDs to help get in the spirit of the thing. One of the movies I came home with was In Search of Lovecraft, a low-budget affair set in modern-day San Francisco. The acting is amateurish (barely above porn movie quality), the sets are cheap (every place has that barely-furnished look that comes when directors rent a house for a weekend and don't have enough in the budget to dress the rooms realistically), and the special effects are mediocre. On the other hand, the script is halfway decent and it's clear the writer is actually a fan of H.P. Lovecraft and tried hard to stick to the Mythos and Lovecraftian themes.As for that chick on the cover, I have no idea who that is--she's not in the movie."
2,Un-watchable mess,"This is a no budget, bad efx (when there are any), poor acting, waste of space. It is shot on the street or in peoples apartments. Some films can be so bad they are good, but this is not one of em."
2,I was worned,"When I bought this film, I was warned by an Amazon reviewer. I should have listened. I love the stories of H.P. Lovecraft and thought I would give this film a try with an open mind. Sorry I didn't listen. It was NOT a good film."
4,An fascinating traditonal learning fantastic resource,Yes well this is an ultimate educational fascinating learning resource tool which explores the species complex relationship of the habitat and what is in the backdrop of habitat area itself with a wealth of dedicated unqiue knowledge of the animal kingdom world magnificant all round.
5,inspiring,"Twenty or so years ago I was loaned this book, and soon obtained my own copy. It is a cherished favorite, read to myself, and to my children (who begged each day when reading time was up, ""Read more!""), and also shared with many friends and neighbors. The pages fell out from use, and are now spirally bound. I love every single thing about this book. It has reaffirmed my faith in God and in the brotherhood of man."
5,nice buy,"good quality arrived fast, warm enough.Will be using this winter at some point.Like the feel of itWould buy again."
5,John Pinette: I'm Starvin'!,This guy is funny as hell. there is not one boring part in this film almost anything he says you laugh at. I hope he dose more stand up comedy in the future. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
5,Soup to nuts hysterical!,"This is an amazingly funny act. John's candor is disarming, yet warm & hilarious. When he gets to the ""motherland"" section of the set, I lose it completely, cos it's so true! We fell in love with this show, & even went to see him live because of it. I give the DVD as a gift to people because I want them to experience John's take on life. There's a little bit of inappropriate language, but on the whole, everyone should see it!"
5,One of the funniest videos I've ever watched,"I love comedy that doesn't have to resort to shock value or demean anyone, and this is a wonderful example. A few incidents of adult language, but none I found offensive. I've watched it several times with groups of friends, and without fail, everyone enjoys it, and comes away quoting this very funny comedy routine. ""Nay, nay"" is one of the lines that has become a staple in my circle of friends after watching this very funny video."
5,"Funny, Funny Stuff","One Of Those comics that leaves you in stitches from the start to the end. not many comics are that great. comedy is hard, but pinette makes it effortless"
5,Funny,This guy is the funniest man in the world. I have watched this video 10 times and I still laugh every time. My kids age 11 - 21 all think it is funny also. My wife doesn't but she doesn't think anything is funny. I can't believe he isn't more famous!
5,Buy this! You'll hurt yourself laughing or pee your pants!,"If laughter adds 7 years to you life, I'm good to go. John is HYSTERICAL!!! I can't remember when I've laughed so hard that I cried & couldn't breathe. Definitely forth buying!!! Treat yourself!"
4,More (of the Same) by the Funniest Man on Earth,"Don't get me wrong, I think John Pinette is the Funniest Man on Earth. I saw the edited version of this DVD last night on Comedy Central. John is repeating too much material from his prior DVD and CD. Great stuff, very funny, but I say NAY NAY---you've done it before, John! You need more new material. I'm buying this anyway, but please retire ""Free Willy"" and ""Fat Man at the Water Park""!"
4,"Usual Pinette fair, good, but repackaged","I made the mistake of purchasing (2) John Pinette videos, ""I'm Starvin"" and ""I Say Nay, Nay"".Both videos are funny. However, they're the same act ! I would have thought that Pinette wouldhave different material on these two videos. Big disappointment with that issue.If you're going to buy one of these videos I would recommend ""I'm Starvin"". Very funny andenjoyable enough to watch repeatedly. Looking forward to some 'new' stuff John !!!Timm"
3,Where's the new material?,"After buying and really enjoying ""I say Nay Nay"" I was looking forward to a ""new"" DVD with ""new"" material. This is definitly not it! If you know his old jokes by heart you will barely bring up a chuckle on this DVD. I can't imagine the reason for releasing this. In addition, the audio mix could be better. The audience is louder than John's voice and it also get's a little lost in the room ambiance. Notice how far away he holds his microphone. Give us 100% new material on the next one John!"
4,Very entertaining,"It is difficult these days to find a witty comedian who is not crass or who thinks vulgarity is all there is to good comedy. I stumbled upon this DVD while in Hollywood video one day and thought I would give it a chance. I liked it so much that I bought it. He is very funny. If you like Jim Gaffigan or Brian Regan, you will probably like John."
5,Excellent,This is more like it - of Pinette's DVD's available for sale this one is the most funny so to speak.He essentially seems to have just the same routine and material in nearly all of his shows but in this one he has definitely perfected the comic timing and delivery of his stuff. Plus It's not a complete re hash of all his old stuff - he does inject some new material in there - but if you're a die hard Pinette fan you've seen all the material before in his various TV performances over the years.I still recommend you definitely get this though as he still gets me splitting sides even though I've seen it before.Can't wait till He comes up with some brand new stuff - One of the best comics around at the moment.
4,I'm starving,"John Pinette is simply brilliant! I thought his video is simply entertaining. However, I bought the other video of his, ""I say Nay Nay"" and ""show me the buffet"", and much of his material seem to overlap in all three. I didn't know this, otherwise one would've been enough."
5,Genuinely Funny!,This is one of the two funniest standup comedy routines I have watched in the last five years (the other: Louis CK). John is absolutely hilarious. I watched this two times in a row. I think I'll watch it again. Enjoy (cause he's really funny)!
2,The same jokes from an incredibly funny guy,"John Pinette's previous DVD,I Say Nay Nay, was so funny that I wanted more. While he's equally good on this DVD, at least 80% of the material is the same between the two performances. With most comedians, they don't bring out a new DVD unless they actually have new material to put on it.If you haven't seen I Say Nay Nay, buy either that one or this one, whichever happens to be cheaper. After all, you'll be getting mostly the same material either way. If you already have his other DVD, buying this one will feel like a big rip-off."
4,"Funny DVD, but missing the best part of ""The Water Park!""","I ordered this DVD after hearing John Pinette on Laugh USA on Sirius. His ""The Water Park"" made me laugh so hard that I cried. I literally had to pull over along the side of the road and compose myself before I could drive the rest of the way home that night. The way he describes being stuck in the giant tube (Nay nay, it was a medium tube at best) pushed me over the top. When I saw that title was included on the DVD, I quickly placed the order. I was so disappointed when we all sat down to watch it (after I'd told my whole family how hilarious it was), to find out that the version on the DVD is much abbreviated. The whole part about having to be ""shot out of the tube"" was left out. I was sad. :(This DVD is a little slow to get started, but the finale about Cold Stone Creamery is hilarious. I'm still glad I bought it, but now must start my quest to find to entire Water Park routine!"
5,Laughed Till It Hurt!,John Pinette is one of those comedians that is truly a joy to watch. He makes fun of himself and his battle of the bulge that so many of us can relate to. I played this for company last Christmas when we had out of town company. It was the evening and we were all stuffed and exhausted. John Pinette left us laughing and wanting more.....
1,Funny. NOT.,"Why would anyone think this guy is funny? He IS funny looking, but still can't tell a joke to... 20."
2,"John Pinette's ""I'm Starvin"" an utter disappointment.",This was largely disappointing. I've enjoyed John Pinette in the past but this video is mostly about a large man complaining about food. Some jokes were funny but about 85% fell flat.
1,Not worth the money!,"I've always liked John Pinette, but this video was not good at all. I watched it with family and friends and none of us laughed the whole hour. I kept waiting for something funny to come along, it just never did!"
1,"I'm sorry, was that funny?","Huh? What is that he's saying? I'm sorry, was that supposed to be funny? I sat through 25 minutes of this, and realized I was bored. I never laughed in the whole 25 minutes. I don't know what show those other people were watching who said this was funny, but this obviously wasn't it. If you want to hear 1 hour and 15 minutes of some large guy talking about food, excercise, his fatness and how miserable he is because of it, then this may be the show for you. NOT funny."
3,"If you have ""I Say Nay Nay"" Save your money!","Wow about 75-85% of the material is on the ""I Say NAY NAY"" DVD! There is about 10 minutes of new jokes. My wife and I saw him live last year and he did a lot more new stuff.Don't get me wrong this guy is VERY funny but, don't release the same stuff.We know your jokes by heart John, put it away."
2,I'm Starving--John Pinette,"I saw John Pinette late 2008 on The View and thought he was absolutely the funniest man ever. So I had high expectations when I ordered the DVD. I was disappointed. He made me smile a few times, but I never experienced the belly laughs like I did when he was on The View."
5,The Great John Pinette,John Pinette is always one of the Greats!! I can't wait for him to come to R.I. so I can see him live!
5,Hilarious,"John Pinette is fresh, clean, and funny. He doesn't go for the punch line, he just tells real stories about his life that are hilarious."
4,very good while being very bad rerun,"I loved this DVD and me and my wife laughed throught the whole thing. So what is wroung with that? Well we also got his early DVD called I say NA NA , Well we went to watch this after the I am Starvin DVD and they are both alsmost word to word the same thing. So We say buy one or the other but not both as they are they same jokes just said at a diffrent place."
2,NOT really that overjoyed,This wasn't as good as I thought it would be.....we like the earlier stuff better.
5,Funniest man alive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"John Pinette is a man amongst mice in the realm of stand up comedy. I laughed until I cried, and narrowly escaped loosing control of all other bodily functions. The man is a genius. I have never laughed so hard at a time when it was not after 3 a.m. I have just purchased everything else of him that I could find, including the movie ""The Punisher"". If you are looking for a good, clean, quality, fun having evening at home with the wife, the kids, and even the grandparents, buy this DVD, you will laugh until it hurts, and then you'll start to cry."
4,He's a natural,The DVD is wonderfully funny and he is a natural entertainer. I've seen him in person and would go to see him again. A friend shared this DVD with me and I will share it with others. Loved it.
4,De los Albures al Sendero,"En el primer libro del Victor se encuentran muchos albures antiguos y nuevos, ordenados segun la particular inspiracion del autor de manera casi academica. Esta recopilacion de albures se inicio en foros de discusion del internet, por lo que el Victor se adelanto a la corriente editora de blogs en forma de libros. Es de esperarse que continue este tipo de trabajos con lo mejor de ""El Sendero de El Peje"""
1,No vale la pena,"Este libro no incluye nada que no hayas aprendido durante la secundaria/preparatoria (si estudiaste en México) y de hecho el libro se queda bastante corto, esperaba algo mas ingenioso pero es bastante aburrido lo que me imposibilitó terminarlo."
3,albures,El libro contiene la suficiente informacion o por lo menos la necesaria para poder entender algunos albures y contestarlos.
1,MUY MALO / VERY BAD,"Compre este libro pensando que tendria informacion interesante y chistosa sobre ALBURES,, pero la verdad me decepcione muchisimo! Pensarias que seria algo divertido y entretenido (que no es), es muy simple y aburrido. Yo lo pare de leer antes de llegar a la mitad. No se los recomiendo a nadie!! No lo compren!!This book is horrible, it is boring and has no interesting information OR substance on the true spirit of Mexican Albures. Two thumbs DOWN.DONNIE1515"
3,"Very Good Late 60's Performance, but a Mixed Bag!!","..I actually remember buying this when I was barely a teenager in 1967, and the cover sold me! Darn nice art design! And there were some songs that still hold up too! The good ones included EVERYDAYS and SAD MEMORY, unusual since they have an almost jazz feel to them, very unusual at the time.EXPECTING TO FLY seemed at times like a masterpiece with a wonderful orchestration, and Neil's singing right on, not the usual whining. Still a nice cut,and very original too! BLUEBIRD a good rocker with some nice guitar work, and BROKEN ARROW, another fine one by Neil. The rest is mediocre, and MR SOUL always struck as one of the absolute worst things ever recorded, though given some of the things issued since then, it may not be in that category anymore. After this, though even some older fans still rave about their various trios, quartets, solos, etc over the years, I thought it was mostly downhill for them all."
4,Tweety Front Floor Mats,Great item!! and fast shipping!! Fits perfectly on my front floor. Be glad to do business again!!
5,Great Children's Music,"This is one great CD for children. As someone who works with children, I really appreciate the music because it is all positive and great music that the children really love. What more could you ask for? This is a great product not just for people in the buisness of working with kids, but also for parents with fun loving kids!!!"
4,The pied piper of the Seattle Children's Music Scene,"My kids first hooked up with Brian Waite when he was running a children's gymnastics program in Seattle...They couldn't get enough! Brian takes his phenomenal rapport distilled from years of working with children and presses it right into this high-energy disc. Nice tight production quality makes it a toe tapper for parents too. This is a must have for those long car rides with your children. My two-year-old loves it and my six-year-old still listens to it. (When not ""jamming to Brittney!"")"
3,It was entertaining,"This movie was not as bad as people tried to make it. Clifton Powell AGAIN plays the bad guy but overall the movie was good. It was also nice to see Kim Witley in another movie, I just love her style of comedy. This play conveys the message that through the love of GOD all things are possible and some people are worth second chances."
4,funny movie,People always find something wrong with a movie. I ask you to watch ityourself and form your own opinion. I liked the movie and it was prettyfunny!
5,no thank,"I hope that everybody is ready when that time come i hope they don,t wait to long to find out about this movie"
1,Don't waste your time,"I had the opportunity to see this play and wish that I could get those minutes back. It was poorly written and did not make sense at all. I truly felt sorry for the actors who acted in this play. On paper it may have seem like it was a great script, but on film it was a disaster."
4,Strong James Gang effort featuring great Bolin Guitar Work,"This album, the followup to the acclaimed ""James Gang Bang"", is a strong and somewhat overlooked album. The record features Tommy Bolin on Guitars, and Roy Kenner on Vocals. Bolin plays a variety of styles, from his trademark, searing slide guitar on ""Wildfire"" to some nice acoustic work (and his lead vocal) on ""Spanish Lover"". I particularly like ""Summer Breezes""...great song and Bolin plays some great slide work, particularly on the beautiful, melodic ending. If you like any of the James Gang's work, or are a Tommy Bolin fan, you've got to add this to your collection!"
5,after 30 years ! !!!,This is a pleasant surprise for me ! I did not know the Great Tommy Bolin was in this band ! I would like to thank Amazon for helping me find that out ! And yes James Gang Bang is on order too ! If you love Bolin ? WHY NOT ! ?
5,One of the best Baby Alive accessory sets,"I purchased this set so that my daughter could have a pacifier for her Baby Alive Real Surprises doll. It works perfectly. The slippers are a little hard to get to stay on the baby's feet, just like my daughter when she was a baby. :-) The nightgown and little blanket are very cute."
4,Rene Chartrand is always worth the investment,It is a quality Osprey publication to give the reader a brief portrait of the notable commanders of the American revolution.
1,CHOCOLATE NECCO'S,THE NECCO'S THAT WERE SENT TO ME HAD BEEN SITTING ON THE SHELF FOR A VERY LONG TIME !!!
1,Don't believe the journal reviews,I accepted the reviews in major trade magazines. I'm now ready to return my second monitor back to viewsonic. A major disappointment after having great success with another monitor. I believe it is a model specific issue.
3,"Paints nice pictures, but unrealistic","I love the pictures that this book paints to my senses. You can feel what the characters are feeling, such as how much Libby wants the horse to be her own. I love how the book ends. Some things about the book are quite unrealistic, though, which I didn't like."
4,Stealing Thunder,Stealing Thunder is one of the best horse books that I have read.I know that some poeple would say that this book was good; but when I read this book I got into the story and I enjoyed reading this book.I liked the part when Griff and Libby saved the horses from the burning barn.I disliked the part when the little white horse ran away and got hit by the truck.I give this book four stars.
3,More info would have been helpful,Length:: 4:17 MinsThis video contains information about the different mounting options and the things you need to know before you buy it.
4,Been looking for a drink holder,"Duro-Med Universal Beverage Holder, BlackHave been looking for one that would fit my wheelchair and that was well made and sturdy. Nicely priced too."
3,"great idea, but difficult to install if you are older...","I had to go and install this for my parent's (they are 81), because it comes with a lot of parts and isn't the easiest for older hands to hold, screw, place, wrap etc... A great idea, but needs to have an easier way to install."
5,The Cup Holder,"I selected this cupholder because I had an old one just like it before. It is bullet proof. The previuos one lasted 6 years on my Quickie. Now I have a Tilite with a strange frame, but because of a versitile mounting bracket it works. Also it is very heavey duty."
4,Only one hang up,This item is worth the money. It is a solid piece of plastic and will last a long time. The holder comes with an insert inside the the mounting piece. Without the insert the circumference is too big and with the insert the cimcumference is too small for mounting purposes. I needed to trim the insert several times in order for the cup holder to remain tightly positioned.
3,"So, so","I bought this for my husband's rolling walker. It's a good size and has an insert cup for holding cans or smaller drinks, but the screw & nut combination that keeps it attached to the walker must be loose by design so it will swing properly from the side of the walker. After only 3 weeks, while folding up the walker to put in the car, the nut must have completely loosened itself and the entire cup holder fell off and rolled across the parking lot. The good news is it didn't break, but now we need to get another nut before we can use it again. I'm sure it won't be hard to find, just a bit of a hassle."
1,Not happy with this item...,"Got this for my 99 year old mother's walker so that she could have a drink with her at all times. I am extrememly unhappy with it because it will NOT stay upright. Even though I tightened the bracket as tight as I could, it still slides down sideways causing the drink to spill."
3,Not for everyone - or every cup,"Some of my cups and glasses don't fit in this holder. Assembly was a little tedious, and the rubber wrapping tape didn't want to stick to my walker's tubing. It's not quite level when mounted. For my needs, I like this one a lot better:NOVA Cup Holder for Rollator/Wheelchair"
2,wheelchair cupholder,The cup holder couldn't screw on tight and it got in the way of the wheelchir brakes. Already broke off
1,Order ?,"If I ordered this item I don't remember and again, if I ordered thie cup holder I never got it, I'm very old and forget a lot but I could usethis holder."
1,Holder won't work on wheelchair .,"Do not work good on wheel chair, had to remodel the holder. Don't buy if you have a wheelchair. Missing the screws and the nut to holder to wheelchair. Would like another holder with the correct screws an nuts for wheelchair. I paid 17.00 dollars for nothing that will work. Would like someone to call me about this holder."
2,Not what I thought.,If you want to use this for anything but a water bottle- forget it. It won't fit. And if you take out the liner there is no bottom on the holder to hold anything else. It is not what I thought. :(
4,Just what I wanted for my wheelchair.,"I bought this for my wheelchair. It took me a little bit to attach it, but wasn't that bad. this will work great for holding my beverages. Like the insulation cup that hold cans to keep your beverage colder longer. Looking forward to using it."
4,Good cupholder for wheelchair,Desent cupholder for putting on a wheelchair. It's seems sturdy and the only real downfall is that when mounted to the side of the chair makes the chair too wide for most doorways and the arm has to be removed and put back on once in the room.
2,"Odd size, doesn't work on mobility scooter","We bought this to attach to a Go-Go handicap mobility scooter and it is very awkward to use. The size is odd, holding nothing we can find exactly right, and it tends to not stay in place. I wouldn't recommend it for this application."
1,Good for cans and mugs ONLY,"THERE IS NO BOTTOM of the cup holder, it has an open bottom. The graduated rings are designed to hold different sizes but makes an uneven surface causing beverages to spill or glasses to tip over. I had quite a mess on my hands. If you ONLY drink from cans or mugs with just the right size handle this may work for you but it was a total waste of money for me, especially as a wine judge."
4,...universal beverage holder...,"...i purchased a universal beverage holder from amazon which can be attached to most any mobile devise...it was a little difficult and awakward to assemble but, after some effort, i was able to attach the device securely to my rolling walker..."
5,Excelent Product from top to bottom,I recommend this product! is an excellent purchase option. Excellent product quality in performance and looks. No product out there in the market looks as good as this one.
1,airport extreme base station failed me,"We have an apple Imac and a PC on the same system. No matter what we tried, we couldn't get the PC to recognize the airport. It worked great for my Imac, but we need them to work together."
1,Biggest Ripoff,"I bought the airport extreme card, and the airport extreme base station. After spending 5 hours trying to install the damn thing, including going back to the Apple store I bought them both at and calling customer service twice, I finally got the damn thing to work. The house it is operating in is less than 1000sq ft and I can't get a signal anywhere other than the room the modem is in. The whole purpose of buying the damn thing was so that I could use it upstairs, but I can't even walk more than ten feet away from it without losing service. I am a big fan of the apple laptops, but as far as the wireless internet capabilities goes, I feel completely duped. I spent over $300 dollars on the damn parts for wireless internet only to find out that the supposed 150ft range was a load of bull."
2,No range,"I love Apple products, but this thing has no range. We can not use a wireless laptop 5 feet form the station. We are thinking of dumping this for a linksys. If we could get someone at Linksys who knows how to use a Mac."
2,Poor streaming quality - find a DVD version somewhere.,"The quality of the streaming video on Amazon for this season was very poor. I purchased an entire season at $1.25 an episode, and I feel ripped off. After I finish this season I won't be buying streaming seasons of anything without reviewing the quality of one of the shows so I can judge the quality of video being sold. The only reason why I bought an entire deason without testing it was because I couldn't find an entire DVD season of Survior Cook Islands on amazon or the ""other auction website""."
4,Bad Cover Art,"This was a great season with many great characters, however the biggest star from this season is missing from the cover-art ""Parvati"" easily one of the biggest stars in survivor history, and one of the if not the best players ever to play survivor fix the cover art it would make more sense"
5,Very good season and HUGE IMPROVEMENT over 'Panama: Exile Island',"This season of 'Survivor' is very good and is MUCH BETTER than 'Panama: Exile Island' which was a mess from beginning to end. Although dividing the tribes by race was controversial it actually did not turn out so bad at all. It has an interesting group of people like Yul, Ozzy, and Jonathon. And this season introduces one of the smartest players in the program's history, Pavarti. Also, there are some likeable women like Becky and Sondra. Also, it is a great season to root for the underdogs. What I also enjoyed about there were plenty of surprising tribal councils. I would definitely recommend buying this season."
3,playback sucks,"playback is horrible.is pauses all the time and makes watching it a pain in the A"""""""""".if this was a dvd I would return it for a new one, but it is instant video purchase."
5,Excellent learning manual for photographers at any level,"This is probably one of the better ""how to"" books on landscape, wildlife and general photography from one of the finest shooters to come along in decades.Text is easy to understand and follow and the related photo essays are very well placed for learning, and are of superior quality.A great book by any standard"
4,Heartfelt,"I fully enjoy Blaze's songs, when he's on. A few of the tracks seem to drag on, but on further listens you appreciate the subtleties."
2,Get the new model,"Convenient to use BUT the set-up, which looks obvious enough is quite tricky. I brought mine back to the store here in Paris- broken after one try at assembly. I spoke to the salesperson who brought me to a room with a wall lined with broken ""Faultless"" RuXXac's- all with the same problem. He showed me the new model with a gear mechanism that seems to make set-up easier. Stay away from the older model which is unfortunately still for sale. Hopefully, mine will be replaced with the newer model."
1,Listed weight capacity not accurate - not even close,"Product literature says this model can hold 275lbs, which is why I bought it. Was using it to ease a 70lb. camera case down a short flight of stairs, very slowly, when wheel cracked and broke midway down. Bad plastic construction of crucial components mean this was a waste of my money. Only used it five times before it broke, never with load greater than 80 lbs., and always took excellent care not to jar it over curbs, steps, etc. The only great feature of this product is its flatness and light weight. Dont use it for anything that weighs more than your cat."
1,not the same item,This item is not the item pictured and described above. it is an exterior under-car red tube with no cigarette lighter adapter. I immediately returned the item after realizing this.
4,A compelling read,"About life in front of and behind the veil, this book presents a compelling read: the body becomes the battleground for men and women to take ownership of their own bodies, and in some ways, consequently their own minds. I was considering this book for a world literature class, but the sex scenes are a little risque for 10th grade. However, those scenes are not gratutious--they have their place in this book. Perhaps, however, not for 15 year olds, just yet. Djebar writes the book in both first person narrative and directive narrative (second person)--what results is that we're inside the head of one woman and the commanding voyeur with the other. Djebar makes us uncomfortable looking in and directing a woman who clearly wants to escape such structures. What we're left with is an uncomfortable with our positions, but the wiser for having become uncomfortable. A great read! Well worth it."
2,the view of a strange woman,"This was my first book by an Algerian author. I found it, hard to say, kind of impressionistic writing, where subjective feelings and thoughts that occur at the spur of the moment count more than actual description. The main characters appear in the story as ""I"" and ""you"" and ""the man"". This no-name-man was married to both women, and the only time he appears in the story is when he calls on the wife to come to bed. The women, meanwhile, are described wandering aimlessly in the town, pondering to take off the veil or not, or worrying about her child who is with the other woman now. I kept waiting for something to happen, for some solution in the hardly existing plot,but... The whole book left me feeling uncomfortable and empty, maybe this was the intention of the author. Anyway, I think, I will stick to Fatima Mernissi in future, much more human and entertaining too."
5,This is my fav. CD,"This CD is absolutly terrific! Along with great drums, singing, guitar and lyrics it carries with it the great message of God's love. The best song is ""Only Hope"". Despite MandyMoore's slaugter of the song, Switchfoot's version is a must hear. I would recommend the disk to anyone."
5,I Never Knew They Were A Christian Band!,"The first time I heard of Swichfoot it was when I had to fill up an extra space on a mixed CD a friend of mine was making for me. I couldn't think of another song to put in so I typed in a random word (""Switch""- the name of her hamster) on her napster search and chose the song ""New Way to Be Human"" by Switchfoot for her to download and put on my CD. When I got my CD I absolutely LOVED the song! It was exactly what I love in music- a mix of rock/pop with a good beat and lyrics that I could understand and relate to. I didn't know that Switchfoot was a Christian band until I went online to buy their complete CD. (I ended up buying all three, which I love!! =D) It shocked me, but I was pleased too. It's nice to have some good music that has a good message to it. I recommend this to everyone!! It is amazing music!!"
4,Upbeat rock mixes with thoughtful heartfelt ballards,"New Way To Be Human jumped out (quite literally) at me at a bible week I went to earlier this year. So I bought it. A truely stunning album that deserves repeated play, giving a wide range of music that will fit your mood perfectly. From the upbeat ""Company Car"" and ""Somsething More"" to the quieter and more thoughtful ""Amys Song"" and ""Under the floor"". This album has it all. The words call for a life less ordinary. Wondering what life IS all about. Enjoyable to listen to and definitely one of my fave albums of the year."
5,Amazing,"Great lyrics, great music, great singing...and they're not too bad on the eyes, either! ;) Awesome CD."
4,Their best albulm?,"I to have disagree with reviewers who say this albulm is not as good as The Beautiful Letdown. I haven't listned to Switchfoot's two most recent albulms (Oh! Gravity and Nothing Is Sound) but I think this is the best of the four I have listened to. (And by the way, Learning to Breathe is also better than The Beautiful Letdown in my opinion). This is an excellent albulm both musically and lyrically.I will agree with a previous reviewer: if you're not a Christian don't let that turn you off. Sure, you may not agree with everything Foreman's lyrics say, but you can still appreciate this for being great music and a lot of the lyrcis are about existential experience and things we all deal with. He is a talented lryicist and whatever he says, he says it well. I am an atheist and consequently don't listen to much Christian music, but Switchfoot is the one Christian band I listen to often."
4,Another good work of Switchfoot,"I love very much the song ""Only Hope"" in this album. It reminds of the hope God has promised and the fact that He hears our prayers."
3,"Detailed, looks nice, too flimsy for small children",This truck looks as nice and detailed in person as it does on Amazon's site; classic and sweet. I bought this truck for our two-year old son and don't recommend that anyone else do that; I suspect he will break it before too long and it is quite thin and somewhat flimsy. Better for collectors or much older children.
5,Exciting Geology,"The saga of Glacial Lake Missoula was so gripping I had to buy Roadside Geology of Washington to see how it came out! Alt and Hyndman are the best authors I've found in this series. While you're at it, don't miss Alt's ""Glacial Lake Missoula and Its Humongous Floods."""
5,Do we have Soul Mates?,"Many of us have asked ourselves the question, Is there a such thing as a soul mate ? or How can you tell? Is a soul mate living in our eartly plane or can they be living in the spirt world. These questions are answered by those who have experienced a common bond.. a unity that can only be shared by few. This book will help other styo understand .. they ar enot alone.. Someone is watching overthem or knows exactly what they need emotionally and physically .I believe we all have a soul mate..but knowing how to find them or even understand the term,"" Soul Mate"" can found in this heart warming and enlightening... I encourage anyone who has ever felt a kindred heart read this book. Dorothy Thompson has agift and it needs to be shared with the world!"
5,great for the toddler set,My daughter loved this book from about 14 months when we bought it till around 2 years. We used to read it almost nightly but have tapered off to only the occasional reading now that she is almost 2 and a half.
4,My son loves it...,We picked this up for our son when he was less than a year and 8 months later he still loves reading it. He loves opening up the door or lifting up the sheets in the book to find the dinosaur. One downfall is that the cardboard pieces that can be opened (like a door or the dinosaurs mouth) can be ripped off by your toddler. Not a knock on the book because that's just par for the course with curious babies.
5,We are hooked on Boynton now!,"This book has gotten us all turned on to Sandra Boynton. What wonderful, funny illustrations, and storylines to match. This was our first book by her and we are expanding our collection very quickly... they appeal to all ages and have given us some wonderful family memories together."
5,Wonderful book,"This one of the most special children's books I have ever read. Almost every night, my 2 yo twins go to sleep with the sounds of ""Where's my binkit!?"" The girl twin refuses to go to bed unless she has it. BTW, we are on our second copy of it now..."
5,We love this book,My daughter's favorite. Sometimes its the only thing that can get her to calm down for bedtime. She loves to find the dinosaur on the page and touch the different blankets. Great book.
5,A FAVORITE!,"This book is one of my 19-month old's favorites. It is quick to read and the touch and feel aspects invites your baby to participate! It includes one of bedtimes more challenging aspects, brushing teeth! The huge print encourages the reader to emphasize and put feeling into the dino's frustration at not having it's ""binket."" And it ends wonderfully!"
3,Not Boynton's best...,"This may not be Boynton's best, but that leaves a lot of room for greatness. It's still a book that enchants children. She is truly a genius & I think I would buy anything she produced. My 2-year old grandson loves them: loves for me to read them to him, loves to read them to me, loves to read them alone, just plain adores them!"
5,Great book,"Sandra Boynton did it again with this book! On each page there are interactive things for the child to do such as look in a mirror, open a flap, or lift a blanket. My 15 month old son has been reading this book every night before bed since he was one and just adores it. I have all of Sandra Boynton's books, but by far this is my favorite. A great bedtime story for young children."
4,Pat the Binkit!,"Poor Dinosaur. It's time for bed, but he cannot find his binkit, and we all know what THAT's like. On every page, he's told to get ready for bed, for he's single-mindedly looking for that binkit, and so are we. There are flaps to lift, paper doors to open...but no binkit.Of course, in the end, not only does Dinosaur find his beloved comfort object, but we get to know what it feels like, in the Pat the Bunny mode. It feels soft and comfy, just right for bedtime.My only tiny objection to this fabulous Boynton creation is that the paper flaps can be difficult for tiny fingers to open, and can also be torn easily. But even if they fall all the way off, the book remains irresistible."
2,Product was dirty and used,"I ordered this book for my 20 month old son. He enjoys it a great deal, but I had to clean the pages before I could read to him and have had to use tape to make sure the doors don't fall off. It was a ""super saver"" but it did NOT specify that it was used and had some dirt (it looked like some type of food) on almost all the pages. I am very disappointed that it was not clear that it was a used book and that I would have to CLEAN it before we could use it."
4,"Better than MOO3, but MOO2 is still more fun","Everyone else seems to be saying fairly accurate things here, so I won't try to reinvent the wheel... MOO2 still has more fun factor than this game, but GalCiv is way better than MOO3, and is an addictive 4x game if you take the time to read the manual AND the ""how to play"" tutorials on the website. The manual by itself is almost worthless, but some kind folks put together a useful free document that you can download from the same place you get the game patch. And the patch is a must!"
5,Great game,"Well, surprise, surprise: MOO3 was horrible and this game is great. The other reviewers will tell you something about why Galactic Civilization is lots of fun. I would like to add a unique element: the designers care and provide frequent game play enhancements and updates on their website. The game is already very stable and fun, so the updates on the website are not patches for the most part. Instead, they are feature enhancements. This is an unusual element---many other developers publish a game and that's the end, except for one or two patches to fix the biggest bugs. In contrast, Galactic Civilizations is undergoing continuous gameplay improvement with already exceptional AI and features. This game is up there with the Civilization, MOO2 (TWO!!!), and Imperialism."
3,"A decent game, but nowhere near Civ III","Every reviewer here is brown-nosing the AI. I guess it's good, but any strategy game I play, the AI is good. I mean, the easy is easy and the hard is extremely hard. There is no reason to go on about how great the AI is. It's smart. End of story.The gameplay is smooth and thought provocing. The only problem is choosing techs. The game has many paths to follow on the tech tree, but no instruction on how to get there. The tech tree is not in the manual or in the game. You have to go to a third party web-site just to view it. I hate that, because if I want to head straight for the dominant military tech, there is no direction on where to go.The game is fun, but access to a tech tree is necessary. The game is enjoyable for a few weeks, but in no way does it stand near Civ III"
1,I can't believe I got SUCKERed again !!,The horrible reality is that I've been committed to the high security asylum Sol 3.Or am I Col George Taylor marooned on The Planet of the Apes.Where the money grubbing chimps dominated buy the Gorillas running the Military Industrial Complex have only managed to produce one 4X space game that doesn't lock up your computer every 2 hours and is fun to play.Well Cornelius this one ain't it.
1,What a waste,This had to be the most boring game that I have every tried to play. I spent 2 hours trying to figure it out to no avial. I feel like the reviews were written by someone who was paid (I must be missing something).
5,Unbelievable replayability value!,"Galactic Civilizations is one of those rare gems of a game that keeps you playing long after you know you should go to bed. But what really makes it stand out is that each game truly feels like its own epic. In most strategy games, Civ, HOMM, etc. each game feels pretty similar. But in GalCiv, the computer AI, random events, and randomized galactic maps, help give the game a radically different feel each game.The game is turn based and it is designed for single player action. But this is the first strategy game I've played where the computer players really seem to play like real people. If you're looking for a thinking man's strategy game, this is it."
3,Disappointing,"Fun for a few hours, but disappointing. I expected more from a turn-based space strategy game in 2003. Not much new here.Among the flaws are no ability to customize the ships, a painful UI, simple combat system, no ability to change the screen resolution, sparse manual, and a few remaining crashing bugs (even with the latest updates).I'd recommend Space Empires IV (a 2-3 year old shareware game) instead. That game has more complexity and depth without the annoyances."
2,Not really much pleasure in playing this game,"From the reviews I ahve read of this game it seems they are seeing a different game from what I have played.I would have thought a possiblity of a ""cultural"" victory was possible. In the 6 games i have found only one thing happens. You are suddenly attacked with more ships than it seems possible to have been built in the time you had played (especially considering the amount of research that should have been necessary). Even if i set the bonuses of my civilization to max research I still find the other civilizations coming up with attack ships before I have even began research on them and by the time i can build much beyond defenders there is a fleet of invading ships numbering more than twice their known planets.I am disappointed in this game enough to go back to playing civilization and wish i had saved my money."
2,Boring.,"On the plus side I'll say the game loaded and worked perfectly out of the box, which is somewhat unusual I'm afraid. On the minus side let's face it: The AI cheats. You can call it what you will but when you're inching out at 2 spaces per turn in the dark with your scout ship while the ""alien races"" are streaming colony ships to all the good star systems around you, the AI cheats.Like most turn-based resource games there's really nothing to DO. Move ships/Move ships/Move ships/etc. To break up the monotony you periodically select a new research topic, launch a new ship type, or pick which planet you're going to colonize or whatever. Space combat consists of a couple of icons flashing lights and making odd noises until one or the other wins. And no multiplayer mode in this day and age is downright criminal."
1,Total waste of time and money,"After my experience with HoI and the majority of the reviews here I bought it. Big Mistake. MoO2 is by far better in terms of complexity and fun. The ""decisions"" you have to make, whether you want to be good or evil repeat themselves all the time and are not exciting after the first time. The research tree is bad, not documented and neglects the slightest approach of userfriendlyness. The whole setting of the game is boring and repetetive. You can only play the humans and lead them to another stunning victory over the other inferior species, so imho it is a truly fascist setting. The handling of your empire and your fleets is bad. The ""battles"" are abysmal. The politics are worse than in MoO2. I would not buy it again and I would not accept it as a present."
5,Not the same test edition as the free online ETS test,"Many of you probably know that ETS.org has free PDF versions of its GRE exams, including the subject tests like Biology. However, the test guides that were published and are now out of print contain DIFFERENT exam questions. So if you can get one, it's still worth your while.Disclaimer: I'm selling my copy, so a review encouraging you to buy this book could be considered a conflict of interest! :)"
3,Not my favorite,"I am hooked on the Kashi Golean bars but this one is my least favorite of them. Maybe I just got couple of old ones or something but the 2 of this flavor that I tried were as hard as rocks. I nearly broke my front tooth (at least it felt that way) biting into them. I do agree it tastes good once you get a bite off, but it's not worth the toothache.Try the other flavors, they are good but think twice about this one."
2,dry tasteless,"I bought these on the basis of other reviews and I'm so sorry. They're dry and tasteless at best, weird chemical tasting at worst. I don't recommend them and can't believe that some people think these taste good."
4,"Surprisingly filling, tastes good","These are surprisingly filling and pretty close to candy bar tasty. I sometimes have a Zone Perfect bar for lunch but it's hard to make it to the end of the day without feeling famished; these Kashi bars keep me satisfied up to dinner time. As others have said, they are quite chewy, which I like, and the nut/grain coating has a good crunchy texture. Know that if you try to wolf one of these down quickly, the crunchy coating makes for a pretty effective abrasive against the roof of your mouth... in other words, chew slowly!Amazon's price per-bar is quite high compared to just a pack of 4 that you can find in big-box stores."
1,Not for me...,"I was looking for a new cereal bar, and the online reviews seemed quite favorable for this product. However, this bar tasted like flavorless chalk to me.I typically eat the Balance Bar (gold) most mornings. My guess is that the Balance Bar isn't as healthy, because it tastes so much better....I recommend trying one before buying an entire box, like I did."
4,"Not my favorite of the Kashi bars (GoLean Crunchy is the best), but not bad","The rolls consist of a very firm and chewy slightly chocolaty nougat-like center surrounded by a layer of caramel and rolled in a Rice Krispie-like coating. The taste is pretty good, and it should keep you going for a few hours.The caramel layer is very sticky, so try not to touch it. The least messy way to eat this is to just pull down the wrapper far enough to take a bite. Keep the rolls at room temperature (chilled you will not be able to bite into it, too warm and you have a sticky mess).It would be great if these were packaged as a pouch of bite-size pieces rather than a roll."
4,pretty good,It's pretty good. I would recommend it if you like peanuts. A little dry though. It does fill you up when hungry.190 cal5g fat27g carb12g protein
2,Hard and Chewy,"I bought this at Trader Joes and it was pretty hard. Maybe it was just old, as others have said. It was so hard and chewy that it hurt my jaw. The taste was ok, not as chocolatey as I had hoped. The caramel was good but pretty sticky, and it got on my fingers. The nuts and things on the outside were pretty good, but kept falling off and onto the floor. I guess I'll try for a less messy kashi bar next time."
1,STALE,I've had this flavor from the supermarket. These are NOT supposed to be like bricks. I threw out 11 of them. I should've sent them back but I was too lazy.
3,Ehhhh just okay,I normally love everything Kashi! These bars are not very good.. they aren't bad.. but they aren't good either. I'm eating them but I don't particularly like them. I'd recommend almost any other Kashi bar instead.
3,GoLean bars,"These bars are OK. The caramel is good but the ""peanut"" part tastes more like some kind of cereal pushed into the outside of the caramel."
3,Too chewy and dry,"If you have dentures or braces or loose teeth, don't try to eat these. The first time I bit into one, I was unprepared for the resistance I met, which resulted in a small battle with the bar complete with slobbering and growling. Note to self--do not eat in public. My solution is to microwave the bar--after removing the foil wrapper!--to soften up the caramel. The taste is decent--and may or may not be worth the struggle of actually consuming it. Personal decision, I suppose."
3,Just OK,If you have not had these before I'd suggest buying one before buying a huge pack of them. They are hard and I have to put mine in the micro for a few seconds so I can bite into it. The calories are also a little higher than id prefer. all in all they are just ok.
3,Pretty good but so hard,"After trying the ""Turtle"" flavor and being disappointed this was better tasting. I didn't mind finishing as it did taste like peanut and somewhat like caramel but it's so darn hard that I couldn't give it better than a 3. I don't want to lose teeth eating these things. High in carbs and sugars so definitely will spike your insulin level big time. I'd probably rather have a regular nut roll for that many carbs and sugars..."
2,"Not sure why this is called ""Turtle"" flavor...","Sooo bland. Was excited to try this but sadly was disappointed. Pretty much flavorless, nothing like a Turtle flavor, too hard to chew and too much sugar for such a tasteless chunk. Not impressed and definitely won't be repurchasing."
4,good for the $$$,This camera does a GREAT JOB for the price. It has all kinds of great features and effects. The only negative I can think of is that it makes a slight noise when zooming in and out.
3,JVC Camcorder Model GR-SXM250U ~Lens Cap Error~,"I bought this camera almost 2 years ago, and it has been great. This camera has a lot of cool features. However, I was very disappointed when I went to use it over the holidays, and it said ""lens cap"" on the screen. I thought I was crazy because the lens cap was removed and I still got message on the lcd screen. Long story short, I can only watch tapes and no longer record. I have notified JVC and I am still waiting for a response on how to correct the problem. I really like the camera and I hope it can be repaired. If any body has experienced this problem~ please let me know what you did to correct it and if it was very expensive."
1,Poor quality control,When I received this Router it looked like it had never been touched there was dirt & saw dust in the screw slots the router plate was chipped and scratched badly plus the 1/2 collect was missing and the thumb switch would not lock I excepted more from a factory reconditioned product. I sent it back and got a new Dewalt 618 router combo and have used it a lot and could not be happier
1,The Mein Kampf of Feminism - the übermensch speaks,"I look forward to a day, when men have finally won the rights accorded to others, that this doctrine of hatred will shock as much as if it were directed against any present-day minority group. But Mary Daly, member of the worlds only majority group with minority status, is living in times which for Feminism are like times in 1940s Germany - where it's an open field for one side, with legislation on their side, while the other lies open for abuse. Let us not forget that what is termed politically correct has but a feeble connection with what is morally and ethically correct. What was politically correct in 1940s Germany stopped being PC there in May 1945. Likewise, this book could only be politically correct in today's culture of mysandronism. Rather than convince us that women are the übermenschen required to save the planet, this book merely shows the moral and spiritual depths to which victimologist Mary Daly has degraded herself."
3,I bought this for 99 cents.,"This is a recording a live performance by Roseanne, although the first and last tracks are not from that show. The album opens with a fake commercial for a compilation album featuring every comedian in the history of comedy. It's pretty funny. Then we have the live performance, in edited form. Roseanne sings a few songs (badly), tells a few old jokes and some new ones too. Most of it is funny, especially when she talks about the differences between the sexes. The album closes with Roseanne's godawful rendition of the classic song, ""I Enjoy Being a Girl"". Roseanne's fans should enjoy the album, which you can probably find really cheap."
1,Roseanne,Very disappointing. Expecting a routine like I've seen on TV specials. Not any thing close. Vulgar and not funny.
1,Yeah - it's a throwaway,Like previous reviewer wrote- good for bike tires and pool toys. It is an oil-less unit= it has a limited life span. 1 year warranty- another junker.
3,Shortbus is average,"Short Bus is a interesting movie that involves a lot of sexual energy. It kind of reminds me of state of total sexual confusion and indecision. I must say that the movie has its highlights as far as frontal nudity and sexual escapades. I kind of felt a little loss for any major thought on it. In some words, this movie shows what a state of sexual confusion can mean to some People. Pleasantly ok with the movie. But is about average. Reminds me a lot of a ""B"" movie.If you like nudity, confusion and drama, this movie has all of it. Over all I give it three stars because I enjoyed the movie, but still felt it lacked a strong storyline."
1,Horrific,"This film is the first film I've seen in a theater that is about sex that actually shows sex. This sex is real too. This movie is so sexual it makes Sex and the City look like Sesame Street. The film is about a handful of characters, all with their own stories and problems, search for, well, sex. This film covers all bases. There is straight sex, gay sex between two men and two women, and men and women pleasuring themselves. There is even a scene with group sex. And it's all real. It shows about as much as any porn would show. The stories are not fantastic, some characters are not developed enough outside the bedroom, and some senarios are silly or unrealistic. The acting was about as good as the acting in a real porn, and the script they were working with was packed solid with cliches. If you want a film with wonderful acting and a compelling story, go somewhere else, and even if you want to see the film for the sex, go get a porn. It is not satisfying in either aspect."
3,A bit too gay,"I'm not squeamish, I'm not anti-anything, and I accept the human condition to be a bizarre mix of insecurities covered by facades and a yearning for normality. I went into this film expecting a better rounded mix of sexualities from NYC, and all I got from it was twisted gay love triangles coupled with psychological issues and female orgasmic dysfunction. I could be wrong, but my opinion is that reviews and descriptions of this film should emphasize that much, if not most, of the film deals with gay issues and sex. Still interesting from an open minded voyeuristic perspective, but that disclaimer should be there for folks who are expecting otherwise."
2,Film message could have been sent in a less open way!,"The message of the film or director might be indeed sent to the audiences, but I questioned if it could have been sent in a much less open way. Sometimes Less is More!"
2,Boring,"This movie was actually very boring. The actors suck, the plot was thin and the character development wasn't up to par with the pathetic sob scenes. It's not funny either. And it's certainly not a realistic portrayal of sex in any sense of the word... there's a relatively hidden tiny minority that engage in this type of lifestyle. Watching this movie was like going to the zoo, but it wasn't enlightening in the least. Beware those who would rate it highly, they often are afraid to have any other opinion when a ""controversial"" movie like this comes along."
1,it blows!!!,"Integrating graphic (and oddly monotonous) sex scenes into an indie serio-comic relationship comedy (think of a typical Jennifer Aniston-type NYC bachelorette feature with antiseptic hardcore sequences), does not an interesting movie make. Booooring! Hedwig, this ain't."
2,Not good!,"I really don't know why I purchased this movie. From some reviews it sounded like it was funny so I decided to buy it. BIG MISTAKE! It is not that good at all and it is not worth $20. DON""T BUY!"
2,OH MY GOODNESS,"Being a former school bus driver, I thought the movie title was very deceptive. I didnt know what to expect from this movie. The movie has nothing to do with a bus! It refers to a shortbus, which I felt means, misfits, and outcasts of society, etc. The movie starts of very slowly but picks up momentum later on. This movie is full of sexual encounters, which show full nudity and sex acts. Even though they try to depict ""The Lifestyle"", I feel they fell short. I am not naiive, but I know lots of that promiscuous sex goes on between heterosexuals and homosexuals. The movie touches on all of these lifestyles. This is not a movie you would want to invite a bunch of friends over to see. At least that is my opinion."
1,RUINED CIRCLE JERK,As it was my turn to host the monthly circle jerk I decided to purchase Shortbus. Neither me or my four male friends are gay so imagine our surprise when confronted with a man sucking himself off whilst we attempt to beat ourselves off. Needless to say I am a laughing stock and am no longer allowed to attend the circle jerks.
1,The absolute worst movie I have ever seen,"I cannot imagine any movie being worse than this one. Really. It was simply abominable. Horrible dialogue, horrible acting. Senseless plot. I was transfixed and had to watch it all because I find it impossible that anyone could have made such a disaster.Anyone who enjoyed this pathetic movie should have their head examined. I am astounded that anyone could have rated it more than a zero."
1,Awful film,"This film is boring with no plot or point, it is primarily a gay film that would be a good method of showing anyone why a gay lifestyle sucks. The actors are bad and unattractive, even the sex scenes are boring and antierotic. I watched it once and threw it away. They didn't even have a script to shoot, they made it up as they went along -- and it looks like it. Don't waste your time, unless you are gay and love boring films."
1,What is this world coming to?,"It amazes me what is being passed off as fine moviemaking these days...this is about as awful as it gets. A movie about sex so vile that ironically it lacks any trace of sexiness. Or dignity. Or character development or story. Graphic sex aside, the ""film"" is more pornographic in the theme it so clumsily conveys: commitment be darned, sexual gratification is an individual right and the key to happiness.And don't even get me started on the acting.Makes me want to go re-rent ""The Whales of August."""
4,Shortbus,"was not porn - just a good indie type film with a twist, enjoyed it, it reminded me of Chain Of Desire which is a great film which it was a little more on the traditional side, where Shortbus went out side the box, I hope for more films like this."
4,"Wow, not what I expected","I think I was looking for another ""Hedwig"" WOW was I wrong. I liked the movie. Very forward. Just my taste for indi movie making."
4,Attention grabbing,This moving was very interesting because it dealt with the short comingsof people with different hang ups in life. From star to finish I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see if there would be a solution to every-ones problems.
3,explicit sex for a purpose,"i'll admit i only bought this movie because of the controversy surrounding the sex scenes. But those graphic scenes aside it actually is a decent movie.Brief summary for those that haven't heard about this. Its a film about sex by the guy that made Hedwig. It follows a gay couple that are thinking about threesomes and a sex therapist that has never had an orgasm. All three end up at ""the shortbus"" which is an underground sex club where even voyerism is participation.It's an artsy fartsy movie and since that isn't my style i really wasn't ""moved"" like some reviewers have said but i did find it to be a good and entertaining watch. The sex scenes are highly graphic, especially the gay sex scenes. If you aren't a childish homophobe you can get yourself through those few minutes. Oh and the opening sex scenes with the sex therapist are off the wall."
5,Unfortunate that this movie did not attract more viewers in theatres,"This is an outstanding movie about working through dysfunctional relationships. It left me with a warm happy feeling. I was surprised that reviewers dwelled on the nudity and sexual activities. Maybe readers who did not know or recognize John Cameron Mitchell's name from Hedwig, were put off by the suggestion that this might be a pornographic movie. That's just not so. Sex is part of life, and definitely an important part of human relationships. Its presence was simply honest and real.For me, the takeaway message was that we're all riding the Shortbus in one way or another, so be kind to ourselves and each other."
2,"Excellent movie, but DVDs are bad","I purchased this movie as a gift. It won, I believe, the GLADD award in 2007 for best film. Excellent movie and very, very interesting as to how it was actually developed and produced.I was incredibly frustrated when, near the end of the movie with only about 15 minutes left the DVD froze. I found no way to advance the film even using the chapters.Thankfully, Amazon did replace the film with another DVD. Sadly, it froze up in the exact same spot. Apparently there was a glitch in the production of these DVDs. I did manage to get to the end of the film with many stops and starts. Very distracting."
2,Much ado about very little,"I was prepared to really enjoy this film. About half-way through, I realized that beneath the graphic sex, the plot was very thin and most of it was for mainstream shock value. Skip this one and re-watch ""Last Tango"". At least it had mulitudes to say. This, sadly, has little going for it."
1,Performance Art Gone Horribly Wrong,"After reading the description and reviews of this movie I was really looking forward to seeing it. It sounded thought-provoking, intelligent and provocative. Unfortunately after the first few minutes the actors began to speak. The acting was fine, but the dialogue was ridiculous and by the end I didn't care about any of the characters. As another review said, this one is definitely a movie to watch with the fast forward button. Very disappointing."
2,"A nice idea, but really not worth your time","I love the idea of a film that depicts sexuality as it exists, rather than in the exploitative manner of pornagraphy which reflects only (mostly unrealizable) fantasy. But this film takes that seemingly simple idea nowhere. In the end, it is just a big bore. The plot (if there is one) mostly centers around a woman's quest to have an orgasm, but one gets the feeling that it just so happened that that was the best footage that the director shot, so he used it the most in the final edit. The film has a workshop production feel -- like the director just gave the actors some ideas of themes and then yelled ""action"", figuring he'd use whatever worked, rather than producing a coherently written film containing a beginning, middle and end. Unfortunately, I think the director only gets one shot at this concept, so we'll not see if he could get it right the next time."
4,sook yin lee -gorgeous,the story was very interesting and informative. the best part of the film was viewing sook yin lee's beautiful body and face. i wish dhe was more visible throughout the film instead of only at the beginning. her acting was good also. i bought another film with her in it. the men in the film did not act as good as her but the story line was interesting. i hope to see more of her in the future.
5,Much better than what I thought.,"A friend of mine told me about this movie, and I was confident I was going to love it. Sex and nudity scenes are never shocking. As a matter of fact very good taste, I understand the director just wants to show nude reality, and nude actors are part of the show. It is ridiculous in other movies, people go to bed, and suddenly it is breakfast. Shortbus shows everything, non stop, and we pay so much more attention to the conflicts within each character, that we simply forget the actors are nude, having sex, or whatever."
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! I kept waiting for the story to develop. I kept waiting for a non-homosexual scene to take place. Total waste of money! Total waste of film. Total waste of time.
1,Disgusting....sex is reserved for the bedroom,"My professor showed this film in class today and I was disgusted! (The class is sexuality and eroticism in global perspectives) I'm an anthropology major and this class is classified as anthropology so I took it thinking it was about sexuality in different cultures.I was totally and utterly disgusted by the sex in this film. Sex is supposed to be an intimate thing between a married man and a woman who love each other and want to show it, not public! Do not watch if you're offended by public and animalistic sex. There was even oral and anal sex in it, which to me is not human!"
5,Loved it,Short Bus was nothing short of amazing. I can't even imagine how to describe it. I'll just say it must be seen to be believed.
2,"great film, defective dvd","Exciting film, quite erotic....dvd was defective, about 2/3 of the way through, the dvd stopped."
5,Awesome film!,"This movie is NOT for children, but if you are an adult who enjoys sketchy comedies, this movie is for you! Contains nudity, and explicit sexual acts, but it is hilarious at every turn!"
1,La Traviata,"I ordered it Oct 22, paid premium for expedited posting and left for Rome and the Opera on Nov 1. It had not arrived. That is nine postal days allowing the exclusion of 10/22( the order day) and 11/1 which was a Sunday.Amazon.com was not responsible for tardy postage which fault lays with Insomniac"
1,The garden of eden,A nice story. But seems disjointed and rambling at times. The plot is thin and easily guessed. In my opinion this is not one of Max Brands better works.
1,Bad Fit for TDI,"Not meant for TDI Touareg's but what is??? Fine material once it unfurls, has a nice lip to hold spills."
2,Be warned do not buy this,This product was not what I expected at all. It is cheaply made for the price. It is all pressed wood. There is no glass or plastic covering in the front. You can only store cds in their cases not loosely and it arrived with the face fallen off I had to glue it back on the display picture makes it look much nicer than it actually is. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Not best, but not bad","If one has not read the three earlier histories of the Supreme Council, SJUSA (1801-1861, 1861-1891 & 1891-1921) then this work will be a very good look into many aspects of the development of the Scottish Rite and the birth of the Southern Jurisdiction. I have to wonder, however, why the author needed to spend as much time as he did on the earlier years of the SJ when it gave so very little new material (and actually less than the earlier works). In short, if you have no history of the Southern Jurisdiction, then this well written and easy to read work will be of value to you and wet your appetite for more information concerning the earlier years of Scottish Rite Masonry in America. If you already have the earlier histories of the SJ, then this will provide you with, at the very least, a nice coffee table book with some good information on the later years of the Southern Jurisdiction."
2,different,"the show a different custome ,they sell the DISGUISE elmo custome and show another.i didn't like the disguise one (also yo can find cheaper with other seller)so when i saw the picture i said ""i found the perfect one""but when i receive it was just the same custome i hate"
2,shoes,the shoes look great but are not much for comfort. When I bought them I was looking for a comfortable shoe to wear on my vacation there will be alot of walking involved but I guess these are not the shoes. They are my correct size but they hurt my feet if worn for to long.
4,Written straight from the heart...,"OK, so maybe it DOESN'T deserve 4 stars, but it is one of the rare books that move you and that make you feel touched.Just like Castaneda's Journey to Ixtlan book, it contains life story of a man who felt reformed by, in Borden's book, some Higher Good and faith in something UNmundane."
2,Lacks Information,"This book lacks information, it is a very short read and not a good account of this great wrestler's career."
4,Christians,This book is a great and helpful book for christians who have fallen off their path. Sting is one of my favorite wrestlers. I am very proud to say that because he is a christian. I cant wait for the movie to come out. I do believe that the book was short and sweet but I wanted it to be longer.
2,Sting: The Moment Of Truth,I would deffinately recommend this book as well asthe DVD it was awesome!!
