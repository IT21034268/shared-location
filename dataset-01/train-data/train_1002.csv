4,Good remake of a classic movie!,"I received my order really fast! Great remake and I'm glad that I ordered it. Thought that the acting was good, made me cry all over again!!"
2,Just Not the Original,"This version of the movie was such a huge disappointment. If you have never seen this movie, do yourself a favor and watch the original. There was no chemistry between any of the actors in this newer version, so it was hard to be pulled into the emotion of this tragic story. The original ripped me to shreds when I watched it years ago, but this version does not give justice to the true story. I remember when this all happened, as I am sure all of the actors in the original version did as well. Maybe thats what made the original so real and heart felt."
4,Brian's Song,"If you don't cry during this movie, there is something wrong with you. This is an excellent remake of the 1971 movie. Get the tissue out!"
1,This is a poor remake,It really looks like it was done on a shoe string budget. The football scenes are lame. Sean's Maher's Brian Piccolo was not well done...and not beleivable. GET THE ORIGINAL...it is worth it
3,"Just the Facts, Lucia (almost)","I powered through this book in a long afternoon. It is a fairly easy read; while I was going through it at times I felt like I was reading a Readers' Digest or a Scholastic (reading is fun!) book. All in all, I would have to say that Hesemann did a very good job of collecting and presenting the information. Througout the book, the author tends to stick close to facts and personal accounts, telling the real-life story of three kids who have made a lasting impact on Portugal and the Vatican if not the whole world. Speculation about what the visions really were are surprisingly few, considering the sensationalist packaging of the book. In fact, editor Whitley Strieber tosses out more opinion (*yawn*--UFO's did it...again) in his preface than the author does in the entire text. For anyone who just wants to find out the facts of the case this might be a good place to start."
3,Discovery of First Hand Reports,The book contains interesting commentary on the events surrounding the children and the reaction of adults . These were unsophisticated country children with little or no knowledge of life outside their small village . Yet despite this adults wanted to control every aspect of their lives and when thwarted showed themselves furious that there is a greater power .The photos are a real advantage in setting the time and place .
1,A dissapoinment.,"This book deals with the alleged secrets revealed to three Portuguese children by Virgin Mary.From the beginning, the book's purpose is obvious: God sends a message that Communists are evil and if the world does not convert to Catholicism and bow before the Pope we are doomed. Communists, Freemasons and non Catholic population will burn in Hell by a God who demands of children to inflict pain on themselves by tying strings tightly on their limbs.This book has been a HUGE waste of both time and money. Open minded people should look elsewhere for a good read. I only wish I knew this before buying it."
4,Kept me interested,It leaves you to believe that the Chatholic church did cover the truth behind the prophoecies given. It leaves the reader to believe that u.f.o's might be involved.
1,Very unoriginal,There are better books about the story of Fatima. This one is a waste of time and money.
1,What a load of rubbish,"Prophecies, God is watching, Lady of Fatima give me a break, what rubbish.Whitley mate, what with the alien abduction stuff , youv'e really lost the plot."
1,Imagination not History,"Such kind of books is based in pure and esasy speculation without any factual basis nor a research on primary documents. Only a minor informed mind can accept this core of text based on beliefs and rumors, very far indeed from the Fatima original documents that were carefull analised since the decade of 1980 in Portugal by Portuguese historians, like Dr. Joaquim Fernandes and Fina d'Armada in their recents books translated into English: ""Heavenly Lighst"" and ""Celestial Secrets""."
5,FANTASTIC AND A LIFE SAVER!,"I must say that my husband and I would have had a much harder few years with our baby if we hadn't read this book. It gave us so many (hence the title) tricks for calming down babies. It included everything from watching the dryer to turning on the vacuum cleaner. Thank you, Diana Greene, for writing such a helpful book, and I hope Amazon.com will resupply this book for all the other moms and dads who need some advice!"
5,This book instantly stopped my baby from crying......,"We bought this book as desperate parents of a colicky newborn. We tried many of the suggestions to varied results. Once Cassie was about 7 months old and we were reading this book desperately, she reached out and grabbed the book and was content for nearly a quarter of an hour!! She is now 16 months and it is her favorite book. There is a baby on the cover and lots of drawings and diagrams inside which endlessly fascinate her. The little square shape is just perfect for her little hands. None of the pages are ripped (unlike every other paper book she owns). What a find! Worth every penny"
4,From the cover:,"From the back of the book:How should personal faith and ethical standards influence work practices and decisions made with the workplace? The authors wrestle with this central question. Inspired by concern over the large gap between private and public moralities, they make a compelling argument for integrating the principles and values contained in Christian social teaching with management theory."
5,very good recorder,"On my last review of the rdr-gx7 dvd recorder, i said i had it since 2/19/03----i should have said 1/19/04. i got my dates really mix up. just wanted to be honest and correct this."
4,It Does What Sony's Says It Should Do,I have used this unit for about 30 days now and so far it does pretty much what the specifications or Sony say&
1,"Don't understand all the raves, this product is worthless !","Having read the glowing reviews on Amazon, I purchased this machine and am terribly disappointed at it's performance. My main reason for selecting this model was that it uses DVD-RW format, amongst others. On inserting a disc, it tries to format it and then rejects it - saying 'dirty disc' on the display. I have tried several brands and have had the same issue. I even took my discs to a local retail store and got the same error message on their machine. Yes, I could purchase DVD+RW's and try those, but I don't feel like investing anymore time or money on a machine that fails to live up to it's hype. Shame on you Sony !"
1,Worst Sony product I have owned!,"I know this unit is long out of production, but just had to put in a review voicing my displeasure with the RDR-GX7. Like a lot of folks mine worked great initially, but within the first year or two I had problems with disc recognition, authoring etc. Very finicky about which media was used. Eventually had problems with discs not ejecting, unit freezing up etc. I thought it was the unit I had and I'm very careful with my equipment, cleaning them as needed inside and out, storing them carefully etc. No easy fixes so like a lot of folks just had to throw this one away! I've never had any similar problems with any of the Sony equipment I've owned, but I guess every company can produce a lemon, and by reading the reviews looks like most of them were. Sony you should save face and refund the purchase price to owners of this product! Don't buy this one new, refurbished or used!"
1,Disc Error nightmare,"Like a lot of other people, my RDR GX7 has started the deadly ""Disc Error/Can't Play this Disc"" message. This occurs with discs I recorded and from new dvds from the studios. Sony says to unplug for an hour which works from time to time but inevitably the same problem occurs. The whole unit is effectively dead now. Bought it about 3 years ago. Had the same type of problem with a Philips unit I bought when burners first came out; it died, I never bought Philips again and got this Sony burner. I'm running out of companies to turn to. This is re-goddamn-diculous."
2,Short product life,Product worked reasonably well but failed after just a little over 1 year.Now doesn't record even with slow Sony DVD disks (hard or impossible to get now)Expensive for what it is compared to new offerings from other vendors.
1,Start out great... NOT ANYMORE,"When I first bought this machine it worked great and I had nothing but glowing comments about it. Then it started to malfuntion with the ""dirty disc"" message so I switch to Sony DVD-R and that stopped. But, then it started to not read and burned discs at all. Now it won't read ANY disc and the dics that I burned from old tapes won't play on ANY machines. I'm glad I saved all my old tapes.I see that they have discontinued this model. That ought to tell us something. I expected better from Sony."
3,Editing features leave a lot to be desired,"I had a Phillips for 3 years and was very happy with it. Newer version had issues with extended recording so I returned it. Circuit City wasn't carrying Phillips DVD recorder anymore so I was left with Sony. DVD + and - is a great feature, but the editing on +RW and -RW is WAY too limited. Cannot create 2 titles from 1 unless in -RV mode, which won't play on any other DVD player. So that's pretty useless. So now if I want to edit any of the DVD's I make, I'll still have to buy another Phillips model.The picture is great on record/playback, and it plays the previous Phillips DVD's with no problem. It won't read the menu created by Phillips- with tag pictures.All in all, the DVD recorder works, but it could use a LOT of improvements. For the cost, I expected at least something that could compete with Phillips."
1,dead after 50 uses,"After loving this unit for two years, it suddenly started giving ""dirty disc"" messages on brand new perfectly clean discs. Sony has no factory Authorized service for this unit and phone support told me to ""take it to Walmart."" Local repair says parts alone will cost $270. I paid 500. they now sell for 250. but in my opinion are worthless after two years. I used to be a seriously brand loyal Sony addict. No more."
5,Awesome!,"After getting the settings right from my audio receiver, I'm very impressed! There were times I would watch a program and the dialog coming from the actors was hard to hear above all the other ambient noises coming from the setting, or the music just didn't sound right because I couldn't quite hear the full instrumentation or the singers voices were being drowned out. The Bose VCS-10 Center Channel Speaker enhances those diluted dialogs from your favorite television shows and provdes a crisp audio definition to any instrumentation or vocals that may have been missing from your current home theater package. I highly recommend it!"
1,buyer beware!!!!,"This vacuum burned my nice, new berber carpet and now I have to get the carpet replaced on my stairs! Prior to that, the hose constantly fell out and I could barely get it suck anything up. The suction is terrible. This was a waste of money and ended up costing me money because I have to buy a new vacuum and new carpet."
1,Don't Buy,"I have owned this vacuum for 6 months, I HATE IT!!! It was fine at first, but I have already had to replace parts in it (roller brush and belt) and even with the new parts it is still giving me problems. If I use it to vacuum more than one room it starts getting overheated and the belt starts smelling, it also has poor suction and doesn't hardly pick up anything. when I empty the dirt out of the cantainer it always dumps a bunch of dirt on the floor, and it tips over easly. I am very disapointed in this product, and I can't wait until I can get a different one. I will never buy a Bissell again."
3,"Good Cleaner, however...","I really like this vacuum. It does a better than average job in cleaning, even superb. I love being able to see how much dirt is picked up. I have one complaint though, it as so many other vacuums are not designed well. Whenever I use the hose attachment which is half of the time I vacuum, I end up cursing loudly because everytime I reach with the hose or try to lead the vacuum with the hose the darn unit falls over. It is either too light or the center of gravity is wrong, who designs these things? You would think by now, that would be one of the first things they test. !@?"
2,"Loved it the first 6 months, then....",it stopped sucking!!! NOOOO!! I can't believe a vacuum only lasts 6 months! What the heck?? I adored this vacuum when I first got it. I vacuum atleast once a day and this one couldn't keep up. Dyson here I come!
1,Junk,"After only 3 months of use, I broke 3 belts and replaced 2 rollers and returned it for another. Now, the roller on this one melted after just a couple of minutes. I have little carpet, too. The Bissell steam cleaner I had barely lasted a year. I'll never buy another Bissell product again. I bought a Shark vac and it's lasted a year so far with no problems."
2,I expected better,"I purchased this vacuum at a lower price from a shopping network after reading glowing reviews. Frankly, it's kind of a bummer. The dust cup does not seal well and dust flies everywhere when I remove it to dump it. The hose frequently unseats itself from the suction tube, usually when it's least expected. My over all opinion is that it's cheaply built. Yes, it has great suction when it doesn't come apart. I've gone through several vacuums (bagged and bagless) since my trusty old Eureka Boss bagged upright finally bit the dust (pun intended). I've leaned there's no such thing as a dust-free bagless vacuum, at any price, because the user still has to empty the dust cup and there's easy way to do that without re-circulating dust. So, I'm back to a bagged Hoover Windtunnel that's much lighter weight than a Eureka Boss. Yes, I bought it from Amazon. I'll review it after several uses. If it works as well and lasts as long as that old Eureka, I'll be a happy camper."
2,Not very durable. Works great for a little while.,"This vaccum is not durable at all. When we first got the vaccum, it did an OK job, but didn't pick up as well as the dirt devil it was replacing. I was kind of disappointed as I had read the reviews and tried to research it before purchasing and thought it would do a much better job.After about 4 months, the mechanism that lock s it in an upright position wore out. A couple months later the motor became so loud that you have to wear earplugs while using it. It still runs, but is louder than a freight train. The filters were regularly cleaned after each use, and it hasn't been too heavily used... Very disappointed, and now in the market fora new vaccum."
4,THIS VACUUM SUCKS... IN A GOOD WAY!,"i have had this vacuum for i think three years now almost. it still has suction and is still is great shape. i love it. its easy to push, maneuverable, doesn't scuff, and it picks up all the shed hair from my two beautiful dogs(pug and pekingnese!).i have had no wear down, no motor probelems, no loss of power. maybe it's because i'm not stupid enough to neglect cleaning the filter? i have purchased many other vacuums, many for more money, some for much more. finally, when factoring in price ease of use and overall satisfaction, its probably the best purchase i have made. my only complaints are sometimes the hose pops out, and i also would have enjoyed more attachments. that's two small complaints. great vacuum. oh and it's purple. chicks dig it!!"
4,Almost perfect,"My only complaint about this book is a slight lack in consistency. Newspaper selections and selection glossaries are each presented in both simplified and traditional characters. However, the examples given to illustrate usage of new grammar points are only given in traditional characters. Aside from this small snag, it's a great buy."
4,A Witty Wittler,"Grapefruit diet? Goodbye. Cabbage soup? Can it. The Zone? Get out! Here are the hottest secrets, tips and extreme measures -- mostly tongue-in-cheek -- from a pair of New York City freelance writers and their elitist girlfriends who regularly lunch bigtime yet still squeeze into a size 4.When bad foods happen to these good girls, they don't weep after they hop on their scales. They tackle foods low in calories consumed per minute (artichokes, 2.3; unshelled lobster, 3.8). During weekends in the country, forget writing that novel (typing burns a mere 90 calories an hour) and chop some wood instead (1,050 calories).It's okay to lick a postage stamp (one-tenth of a calorie) but if you're stuffed up, skip the NyQuil (92 calories an ounce). And bear in mind that breaking up with a boyfriend usually means losing seven pounds (a custody battle, more than twice that). What do the authors advise if you still have cottage-cheese thighs? Keep your pants on.Weird, wacky look at the real deal."
3,that's why you're still overweight,"This book was obviously written tongue in cheek and everyone who has reveiwed this book previously needs to calm down. i am a size 2, 105 pounds and think this book is great. it does have some ridiculous ideas in it, but you wanted to know how skinny women stay skinny, thats why you bought the book. well, how we stay skinny isnt always ""healthy"" or god-forbid ""american."" this book wasnt written as a HEALTH book or a NUTRITION book, it was written as a good old fashioned DIET book. It is not warm and fuzzy to overweight people who want to hear they can eat the food pyramid and lose weight. this book, unfortunately is based on reality, like it or not."
3,Not the most responsible way to go........,"I read this not knowing whether to laugh or gasp. There are some tips in this book that range from the interesting (chewing gum as an appetite suppresant) to the odd (salting your food to the point where you wont eat it; chewing your food but not swallowing it) to the absolutely insane (Tylenol as a weight loss trick to speed up your metabolism, BLEACH on your food to prevent you from eating it). I wouldn't recommend this as a way to go, but if you want to at least expose yourself to some truly unconventional weight loss ideas, I guess this is the place to start. My sincerest suggestion to anyone who reads this is to be careful; this book screams of eating disorder potential."
1,Sick Book By Unhealthy Women. Pity the author...,"Have a borderline eating disorder? Want a full blown one? Want to start smoking to curb your appetite? How about fasting for a few days? Pure liquid diet? Abusing ephedra? Getting depressed on purpose so that you will lose your appetite and not eat? Swallow tape worms? If you find these ideas appealing then by all means, read this book. If you have EVER even considered the idea of starving yourself or bingeing and purging, then do not read this miserably, sickening, twisted, self-defeating book. Written by a bunch of sick women who are self-proclaimed gossipers, diet junkies, and bitter at the world, this book revolted me. I was expecting a ""tongue in cheek"" book that reflected how silly we women can be when it comes to weight obsession and our health. Instead, my ideas that we as women are our own worst enemies, was deeply confirmed. I am truly disgusted."
2,Not worth buying if you are serious about wait loss.,"I bought this book, and although it is humorous, I feel it is downright irresponsible. It makes a small disclaimer in the beginning about not using the book if you are a teenager or have an eating disorder. My guess is, if you follow much of the advice in this book, you will end up with an eating disorder. There are a lot of suggestions that are potentially dangerous to your health, and don't offer almost any of the risk factors involved. Of course it is meant for a mature adult to read, and decide for themself, but there are many other books out there that have much better ideas about getting skinny. By the way I have many friends who have healthy, lean, and strong bodies who simply eat healthfully and work out a couple times a week. If your smart, you will know that moderation in eating and moderate exercise is the way to go."
5,White Jeans Review,"My husband bought me this scent as an anniversary gift one year. It has a subtle, feminine fragrance that continually brings me compliments from complete strangers. This is the only scent I wear and it can no longer be found in the stores. Fortunately Amazon always has what I want & I was able to obtain it with just a click or two; and it was delivered right to my mailbox. :)"
5,great price! Wonderful!,"White Jeans is extremely hard to find and buy anymore without paying outrageous prices! I came here to Amazon and found it! My lucky day! Great price too! I love the way this perfume smells, I get compliments all the time."
4,Good overview of facts,A nice overview of the Jehovah's Witnesses by one who knew them very well. He has totally mastered the material and is a clear writer. He could have afforded to be more gracious in his presentation -- the facts about JWs are damning enough without having to rub it in like he does at places.
1,o come on!,"hey you dont know untill you try! just let an adult launch it first and then let the child after seeing what you need to do and what may be dangerous! yes i have an air rocket. its alot more simple though. it goes about only about 50ft. or so. they just want you to know IT WONT KILL YOU but it still may hurt because the force. if you get hit just right you may get a slight concussion, but nothing too serius. i gave it 5 stars because hey they (air pressure rockets) are raw fun!this rockets more complex then mine. mine used to go bout' 120ft. ur so. its an air hog. its the airhogs Boeing Delta air rocket. not sure they sell it on amazon though. you can get it at targets sometimes- i bought mine at a target that we (me and mom) had to search for 1 out of three in the area. anyway have fun with the air rocket that you SHOULD launch!"
4,PLEASE READ THIS!,Please note that if you are 10 to 18 you will not be able to launch 1000 feet. Otherwise it is a great toy. And one last thing you have to buy refills of little discs called membranes. THE END
2,Alright,"This rocket launcher is pretty good for just air launching. The launcher has a limit for how much pressure it can hold. I've purchased the launcher on ebay under ""soda bottle rocket launcher"" which comes as a kit. This launcher launches soda bottles using water and compressed air. Of all the launchers I've tried this one out performs them all. Its lightweight and durable enough to hold up to 120 psi and sends rockets screaming into the air. Designing rockets and recovery mechanisms is a blast. Check out the link to youtube that demonstrates this launcher being used! Oh, it's only $[...] plus s & h!!!!!"
3,fun never lasts forever,"This rocket is a blast the kids love it and the adults are impressed how high they go. I was disapointed in the rockets, I was glad I didn't buy extra vinal patches because both of the rockets foam tips broke after about 10 to 15 launches. It was great fun while it lasted."
3,could be better.,"The product is made of very cheap materials. The base is all foam and is easily blown away by wind. The rocket is thin pvc pipe covered by a cheap sticker that constantly peels off on its own. It is fitted with a foam tip. The rubber hose that connects to your air pump seems good quality. Certainly the product looks like something made in China, but its actually made in USA! Is this what American-made products have become? Anyway, the product does perform well. The rocket goes very high, but not 1000ft as advertised. I've used it with almost no wind. The highest it goes is about 600ft maybe 650ft. Still, it is high enough, I guess. If you dont keep an eye on the rocket, you can very easily lose it. Don't put a tail on it, it degrades its performace significantly. You may want to paint the rocket with bright color to avoid losing it. Overall, it is a decent product. Just don't expect the fun factor to remain high. It loses its appeal fast."
2,"Nice cd/dvd case, but service is terrible","The product is great, but the service was terrible! I didn't receive the product when I was supposed to. They shipped it really late! I tried contacting Mighty American through e-mail, but they never responded. The company (Mighty American) did give me a smaller cd/dvd case along with the larger one I ordered free of charge though and apologized for the delay in a note that came with the package. That I do appreciate."
3,Nice,I gave this as a gift for my daughter and she liked it. She put all of her wandering CD's into it and they hold nicely in it. I may be ordering another of these products soon.
1,Not true to description,This cd case is super cute but description was to hold 48 CDs & it only has 8 pockets. It was a Christmas gift to my daughter & we were both upset to learn that now we'll have to search for another. That was a waste of my money since now I'll have to purchase another & so far we cant find one as cute.
5,"Holding up well, daughter loves it!","This is very stylish and my daughter loves to show it off to her friends. They think it's so cool. It's a great way to transport dvd's, cd's, cd-rom games, and wii games. Zipper is easy to use and durable. The outside feels soft and smooth. Makes a great birthday gift for any girl ages 8-14."
3,A WOODEN PERFORMANCE DEVOID OF SPIRIT !,"in comparison with the delightful performance by the Ballet School of the Opera de Paris which is also available from Amazon on DVD. I bought the other version first, after which this one seemed so boring and dispirited. I also regret having to say that the corps de ballet of the OdP ballet school seems better trained than that of the Royal Ballet. It seems the RB has given up on perfect synchronisation of movement, something about which I had written to (Sir) Anthony Dowell in the mid-Nineties. No improvement is evident at the time of this performance (2000). The exclusion of Act 3 which is superfluous and irrelevant to the drama makes for a much tighter performance without any anti-climax."
2,"music fine, costumes sometimes dumb, dancing just very good","Not good enough to warrant the high marks... orchestra very fine, red boots and bowler hats and extra wide cuffs simply are distracting at best... dancing itself is fine but main dancers simply not charismatic which is especially necessary for this ballet, just ok- enough said..."
1,Not Made in England,"I also purchased the Churchill China Brook Blue set of 8 (45 pieces) and the set of 4 (20 pieces) intending to have a matched set of 12. WRONG. The set of 8 was indeed made in England and contained soup bowls (listing on Amazon only says ""bowls""). The set is very nice and has high quality. The set of 4 and the completer set, however, are MADE IN COLOMBIA. The color is more saturated, the salad dishes are about 2 inches smaller than those made in England, the ""bowls"" are cereal bowls, and the vegetable bowl and platter are both smaller and less detailed than those made in England. Suggestion: if you want consistancy, order two sets of the 45 pieces and don't fool with the add-ons. Amazon could not guarantee the ancillary pieces would be from England.... despite the on-line description to that effect!"
5,A truly stylish and thought provoking journey!,Mr. Mukherji's unobtrusive direction and hosting styles allow us to sit back and truly listen to these four intriguing hosts. A truly stylish and thought provoking journey. I loved it!
4,Excelent,I bought this title and other one of Sonique. I think Sonique is excelent and so this song.
2,Better than most of what's out there,"There is embarrassingly little available for parents of children with NLD, and this book is not great but is better than most books. (The only one better is ""NLD at school"" by Tanguay.) This book at least does cover some of the basic issues that come up for children with NLD, but there is too much focus on how the author solved her own child's issues rather than providing a selection of ideas."
3,Who wrote this book?,"My copy of this book, copywrite 1998, 2000 reprint, has John Heilig as the author. There is a preface by John Heilig, in which he talks about his chidhood interest in Mercedes-Benz.Anyway, the book is good as a coffee-table picture book, but don't bet on any of the written information in the book being accurate. In parts of the book, John refers to the W126 S class cars as W196 C class cars. He also noted that the S class W126 was unveiled in 1985. In reality, it was 1979. These are just two of the many mistakes in the text.This book has too many glaring errors. While it may have been proofread for spelling and grammar, it was not proofread by anyone that knows Mercedes-Benz.The pictures are beautiful, however."
2,the second star is for not being as bad as everyone says it is,"hey, i upped it from one star to two because no matter how bad it is, its not as bad as i always imagined it would be, and i give it credit for that. plus, its got one of my fave actors joe silver. i wont even comment on the song!"
3,Once A Pretty Song and Movie...,"I remember this film when I was a kid. Don't think it did well in the theaters. However, the title song itself was HUGE. I mean HUGE. For a while, up until 1982, this was a quintessential love song.This tune sticks out in my head because during elementary and early junior high, we had to sing this song during our music classes. Ugh.Totally forgot about this song until recently, when the news reports about composer Joseph Brooks came out. As it turns out, the man was an egotistical sociopath/psychopath. Not only did he have visions of grandeur, but he was a pervert, psychological abuser, and (accused) rapist. This was the same person who had penned such a sweet song such as ""You Light Up My Life."" The same person who directed this movie. Wow.On top of that, his own son is currently in jail without bail. He stands accused of murdering his estranged girlfriend.Just goes to show you, appearances aren't everything."
1,THE WORST MOVIE EVER,"This movie is horrible in every way. From Didi Conn's totally unbelievable lip-syncing to the unintentionally hilarious scene where a grown Didi bomb's on stage doing her child comedy act, it is a world class stinker."
3,A pleasant respite,A very pleasant movie although not very well acted.The story line was somewhat predictable but you foundyourself smiling on several occasions. Best theme songto a movie I've ever heard. A movie you should see atleast once.
2,Leaves us in the dark,"The song ""You Light Up My Life"" was a mega hit back in 1977 for Debby Boone, the daughter of Pat Boone. This song, and several others included in the film are the only redeeming quality this film has to offer. A lousy screenplay with sub-par acting by the key players would make most of us want to see what's on the other channels. Don't watch the video late at night while in bed; you may fall asleep leaving the VCR and TV on."
1,Only If you LOVE Michael Zaslow,"As a big Michael Zaslow (Roger Thorpe, Guiding Light, CBS, 20 plus years) I have this one in my collection. It is a TERRIBLE movie, however. Mediocre plot, dull, boring, podantic, terrible acting."
5,HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE IT?,"Is it corny - yes. Is the acting terrific - no. Why do I like it so much? - it depicts what to me is one of the most important, beautiful things in life - unqualified love between parent and child and vica versa."
1,A real turkey,"If there was a way to rate this movie less than one star, I would do so. I saw it in '77 when it came out. Went in not liking the song at all, but heard from others it was a ""great"" film. I guess ""great"" is subjective! Unrealistic plot and terrible acting. Never understood why the song won a Grammy. But then, ""Boogie Oogie Oogie"" also won a Grammy. Go figure."
4,review of songs,The cover shows picture of Miss Day with a number of selections includingI could write a bookS'WonderfulI want to be happy.............Preview of songs does not include the three mentioned above....Plz verify.................thxs/Pete
4,Worth the price and worth putting up with the scent!,"This product works well at reducing the signs of aging on hands. I imagine that it would work on the face, too, as another reviewer indicated, but I can't imagine trying that because of the very strong scent that this product includes. I find it unpleasant, but nevertheless I am a loyal user of the product given the incredibly positive difference that it has made in the appearance of my hands. That said, I'm clearly less-than-fond of the fragrance, especially coming from Neutrogena (known for its hypoallergenic offerings). The scent knocked my rating from a 5 to a 4."
4,Helpful for both new players and first/second edition veterans alike,"This book was worth buying. It explains the game in areas beneficial to new players (covering issues not covered in the core books)and veterans of the first two editions. It does, however, also cover information already in the core rules (such as character creation basics), which may seem redundant to some players, but overall I recommend this book to anyone overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information in the core books and expansions."
2,It was okay.,"This book was alright. It doesn't really tell you anything that's not in the Player's handbook. 3.5 edition. I wouldn't recommend buying this book.. Just read the player's handbook & if you need help, call your GM/DM (dungeon master/game master). Additionally, since 4th edition came out, you may want to check that out, because it's dumbed down a lot.. Or check out Pathfinder.. Unfortunately, this book is pretty obsolete now."
5,Great Title for Beginers,An Amazing resource for starting players. The D&D books can be overly complicated & confusing to new players & non-RPGers. This Helps ALOT in explaining vast amounts of info. Some of it is a little out of date(it's a 3.0 book)but still a great resource. There are 3 premade characters for 4 of the base classes & notes on all classes that really help you out in the begining. The top 10 spell & monsters lists are a gream way for a beginer player or DM. It includes a premade adventure& sample map!
1,Base and disappointing example of the worst of roleplaying,"While this book is easy to read and nicely arranged, there my compliments end. Any experienced roleplayers that pick this book up are likely to be turned off by the twinkish attitude it has. Though it's mainly for learning the technical side of the game, it makes no attempt whatsoever to mention the roleplaying aspect of the game. Much to my horror, I found a whole chapter on min-maxing something that's generally considered one of the worst aspects of D&D, complete with a big encouragement to multiclass solely for the abilities of the classes. I would suggest this book only to those players that only care about killing goblins in dungeons, as real roleplayers that want story and characters will hate this book."
1,Unnecessary,"This is just completely uncalled for. There's no reason for this product at all. And if it weren't for the simple fact that just the thought of them having to release this book at all has made me laugh so hard I can't see straight, I'd be absolutely angry."
2,"Good, but Mis-Leading and Out-Dated","There is some good information in this book, but there is a 2nd edition out and hopefully Amazon will be selling that one instead of this one soon. The problem is that some of the magical equipment recommendations are no longer a part of the 4th Edition rules. I assume the 2nd edition of this book addresses that problem, but I am really disappointed that I bought this book and some of it doesn't apply..."
4,Thoughts on D and D 4 for Dummies,"Good book. a Little light on races unlike the original ones, but all in all a useful, informative book"
1,"Great film, but stay away from the DVD","One of the biggest travesties of modern cinema is that director Valerio Zurlini is not better known. ""Black Jesus"" is a masterpiece in every sense. An even bigger travesty, however, is the Ivy Video DVD (the only one available in the US as far I know). It is dubbed, and while there is no such thing as a good dubbing job, this one is worse than most, and this just about ruins the film. In addition, the print used for the DVD transfer looks like it was pulled from the dumpster, and the sound mix is abysmal."
2,Why didn't Kathy Kahler do the video herself?,"The scenery is beautiful. The artistry is creative. Claudia is beautiful, but she does not have very good form. This is especially noticeable when they show Kathy doing the same moves. She is so much smoother. I found myself watching the little box with Kathy in it and was frustrated when there was only Claudia doing the moves. I was also hoping for a little longer workout. Tamilee Webb's Abs of Steel v.1 is still the best I have seen."
2,I've seen better,"These are okay excercises but Ms Schiffer's movements are so jerky (on all four tapes) that I'm afraid she's going to hurt herself. I also worry that someone watching the video will follow her jerky movements and hurt themselves as well. It would have been a better video if the trainer, whose form is excellent, was the star of the video. But I guess Claudia Schiffer's name sells more videos..."
1,Not a very good video at all.,"One day me and my daughter were looking for a workout video (seeing that she's only 12) I decided to buy all of Claudia's work videos thinking that they were good. To my surprise, its not really much of a work out video. It's more of a guy video. Sure men are easily entertained by this video, but I think she shouldn't of wasted her time in making this video. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at all. I'am a bodybuilder, and to me this video is totally silly. Nothing but a bunch of men will enjoy watching this video."
5,180 crunches? You can't go wrong,"Great tape, and as promised, if you finish it, you'll do 180 crunches. There is room to add weight for those seeking something harder, but I find this both challenging and fun to watch. It's beautifully filmed with some interesting standing ab exercises as well as the crunches you've come to expect. Wish these were on DVD, but thankfully, I still have a VCR for my gym. Worth checking out."
3,Great Ab Workout!!!,"I was very impressed with this video because I did have doubts. It turned out to be a great workout. There are so many reps and by the end you have done 180 crunches. The trainer Kathy Kaehler demonstrates the exercises really well and its easy to follow her, and listen to her. The video is one that you will have to grow with, at first it might be a little challanging to keep up with all the reps. The only two things I didn't like so much were Claudia doing the exercises, it didn't look correct, and the stretching breaks were too short. I guess you have to pause the tape yourself if you want to hold a stretch position longer. Overall I really enjoyed it and plan to use the tape five days a week."
4,Churchill China Brook Pink 45-Piece Dinnerware Set,"The set arrived before the projected date. One serving bowl was broken but Amazon took care of the cost of replacement. They offered to pay shipping back and send a new set but I chose not to go that route. I liked the dishes and the pattern very much. I expected them to be made in England, although I knew the pattern had been discontinued. They were made in Columbia, instead. I would have given five stars had they been from England as the gravy boat I ordered seperately was. After pricing other dishes and checking all around, I feel the set was a very good buy."
1,disappointed,The dishes were not fired properly and were different shades - The size of the bowls were not as pictured or described. They were not packaged well and arrived with some broken. We had difficulty dealing with your customer service department and had to make multiple calls to receive proper credit.
3,Very Technical,"The good: plenty of drills and skills instructions for your practice agenda. The 'not so good': this book reads like a college text book. Not that that's a particularly bad thing but, unless you have a photographic memory, be prepared to take lots of notes to simplify your on field reference material. Secondly, the illustrations are hand drawn stick figures. I don't find these as effective a training tool as photos of real players.If you're an experienced coach then this book would probably be a good addition to your library. If you're a new coach and just starting your library, you should consider ""less complex"" material."
5,Thought Provoking,"The Other Side of the Coin makes us step back and rethink previously held views in a straight forward, common sense approach. Did we get these views from our parents, our church, our government, the TV? It makes us ask ourselves why we hold on to them and if they are still valid.A ""must read"" for those who want to be informed and challenged."
1,buyer be aware,"There are many FREE videos on smoking, how it affects your health, all geared towards teens, all available for free from the Centers for Disease Control. If you have a big budget, I'm sure this DVD is OK, but why spend the money for things you can get for free?"
4,El Pasoan's should read this.,"If you grew up in El Paso, you'll recognize the people and places. It's full of drama and conflict. It explains the legal issues pretty well. It's well written."
5,Dirty Dealing: Drug Smuggling on the Mexican Border and the Assassination of a Federal Judge,Very good book. Interesting how the drug dealers ran their operations. This takes place in the 1970s when dope was everywhere. My brother
5,My 10 year old LOVED it,"My 10 year-old son, usually a reluctant reader, loved this book so much that he repeatedly chose to read beyond his ""required"" 30 minutes of reading time. Also, he kept running in to me to read me excerpts - he thought it was hilarious. He brought it to school to ask his librarian to get it. Wow! I've ordered the second and anxiously await the 3rd."
5,Love it!,I just love the books! They are so funny and humorous! Philip has a way with words. My kids enjoy reading them as well. I hope he writes more books soon!
4,I liked this book,"We read it in class this week. It's a quick and easy read, maybe a bit childish, but overall pretty good. It was in an interesting format with the author going off on tangents, foreshadowing events to come, telling jokes, and other ways to involve the reader. Some may be confused by the format but I liked and enjoyed this book. I'd reccomend it to anyone who just wants a short and easy to read fun book."
4,Free&Easy,"I recieved this the day after it came out (the 24th) of April, and it had the first pressing label. I recieved it from Cd japan, which is much faster than amazon when it comes to imports. The Original Mix of F&E; is excellent!! Get Daybreak with this one, cause those tracks are hot too! The track listing is:1. Free & Easy- Original Mixremixed by Yasuo Matsumoto (5 stars)2.Naturally- Dolly remixremixed by CMJK (who did the ""Opening Run"" remix(on the Daybreak single)5 stars3. Still alone- Warp Brothers extended Mixremixed by Warp Brothers - 4 stars4. Free & Easy- Original Mix-Instrumentalremixed by Yasuo Matsumoto - 5 starsBuy this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Purposely outrageous,"Hard to imagine how Waugh got away with his slamming of anybody on the horizon. He must have been sued for defamation over and over again, but the cases must have been laughed out of court. To be read in small batches."
4,Actually a pretty good book!,"At first I wasn't really sure how good this book would be, but the more I read the more I like! Ms. Kirkland did a wonderful job with description. And she did a great job pulling me into the story and feeling what the characters were feeling. The only problem that I had with the story was that the heroine seemed to me to be blind about her ""real"" true love. To me it seemed to take a little to long for her to accept the truth of her feelings and figure out that it wasn't her betrothed that wrote her those wonderful letters that she fell in love with but in fact his friend. Overall it was a really good book that completely kept my attention for the entire book. I do recommend this book to many people."
4,Gorgeous cover,"I bought if for the beautiful cover, kept reading for the fun story. I highly recommend it."
1,Total junk,After about 4 months of using these cables they are starting to flake out. My screen will start flashing and one of the colors will go completely out. Have tried hooking it up to different inputs on T.V. and used different sources with same symptoms. If you dont mind jiggling the cable every other day then these may be for you.
3,LaPlante,"Plugs are oversize & kept slipping off of female input plug Input plugs on these cables could be narrower. Finally got them to stay on by crimping metal ears just a bit. Have no idea whether they provide a ""cleaner"" RF signal to the TV versus cheaper cables, and if they do, is it enough of a difference that the viewer would notice? Anybody have any proof that it does? Product seems to be well made and rugged."
5,Gave as a gift and they are happy,"Bought these, a hdtv, and some audio cables for a gift and the person is happy."
3,"Consider the length before you buy, not flexible","While I have no issues with the quality of these cables, they are not very flexible. This may be true of many other component cables as well, but in my case I would have been much better off with just the 3-foot length. Given the stiffness of the cables it is difficult to manage the exta length. If you read the reviews of the 3-foot version you will see similiar comments saying to but the 6-foot version. Bottomline: Know where you will place your components and the minimum required cable length before buying this product. It is too stiff to easily manage extra length."
5,component video cable,"The cable worked has described, I hooked up my DVD player to my HDTV using this cable. I used this cable for the picture quality & so far it is performing as expected."
4,Belkin Cables,The belkin component cables I ordered from amazon.com arrived on time and in good condition. I believe my picture quality has never been better.
3,"Great picture, when it stays plugged in","I'm not sure what the issue with this cable is, but when it stays put the picture was noticeably better than my previous set of Component plugs. However, these plugs slip right off the inputs with even the slightest tug.With all the good reviews, I have to assume this was just a bad one in the bunch. I've secured the cables in place by pinching the rings ever so slightly to have a more snug fit and haven't had any issues since."
4,I'd buy again,"The length is nice, not too long or short. The picture came out great and they seem well made.My only trouble was the struggle to push them onto the outputs. Whether that's the cabling's or the video player's fault, I don't know. Once on, I was sure they would never come out if I moved items around. So maybe it was a good thing."
3,Liked Eyra Gail's Remake better,"I just recently listened to Erin Hamilton's remake of the old Cheap Trick song I thought it was a good song, but I must confess that I like Eyra Gail's remake better"
4,ibstpi's Standards,"This new 2000 ibstpi Instructional Design Competencies book builds off of the core Competency Standards introduced in the original Instructional Design Competencies: The Standards.It contains an Overview of the original Competencies Standards, and further, addresses the Development, Interpretation and Application of the Core Competencies.For instruction groups and designers, the other book available published by ibstpi is Instructor Competencies: the Standards Volume I. It provides an authoritative listing of competencies considered to be essential for sucessful training..."
1,Ridiculously Awful,"I liked the cover, Content is below average, and the DVD and case are very poor quality. Received both the original and replacement with yhe disc loose in the case... The seller admitted it is a known issue with the manufacturer that the spindles are defective... Rated the seller negative for knowingly sending defective items and will NEVER DEAL WITH SINCLAIR AGAIN... The NERVE knowingly sending DEFECTIVE products!!! Waste of Good Money. GTHRC......"
2,Faulty research in at least one topic,"I'm proofing a lesson on African American History and our writer quoted the South Carolina Slave code from this book p. 105 (year 1830). However, the list there is NOT the Carolina Slave Code and in fact contradicts it. The author(s) used a list from Stroud's 1827 Sketch of the Laws Relating to Slavery. See Stroud's second edition p. 39 for how he contrasts his list of ""corollaries"" with the real laws in each of the states. God help us if other students, educators, and writers use this book for their own research."
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AND AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I bought a DVD from this seller and it was defective. I contacted the seller and he told me to return it back to him to see if there is anything wrong with the DVD. I sent it back to him and he writes me an email stating nothing is wrong with it and sends me back the DVD in my envelope with the words ""Refused Back To Sender"". What kind of customer service is that? I do not know what kind of DVD player he has but I have a Panasonic and Sony that plays all of my other DVDs just fine. This DVD does not work and yet the seller refused to take his defective product back. I am in the middle of disputing this erroneous transaction! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER! He will screw you over! What a waste of my time and money!"
3,If you really have four hours to burn...,"""Lagaan"" starts like it might have something to communicate about the various human reactions to colonialism, but it ends up as your typical ""big game"" movie ... somehow occupying a heretofore undiscovered space between ""In the Name of the Father"" and ""Shaolin Soccer"" and suffering the same fate as every other flick that's ever tried to have it both ways (whatever ways those might be).I stuck with the whole four hours intrigued because I couldn't imagine that such an ambitious and voluminous work would be headed for the only conclusion I could conceive ... one way too inevitable for audience and critic alike.Shows what I know."
1,would not buy again,"The sender sent the product quickly. The DVD is not formatted to American DVD players. I will not ever buy from this vender again. My daughter bought DVD's while in India, she was told they were formatted for the US. Now we have 2 DVD's of this movie and we can't watch either of them."
1,Not as Advertised,"This may be a wonderful movie. However, it's advertised as an English language film. It's not. It's in Hindi."
5,Out-Hollywoods Hollywood -- great fun!,"Yes, it's 15 minutes shy of four hours, and yes, it's mostly subtitled -- and yes, it's absolutely perfect. I saw the film at a cinema in Pasadena, Calif., in May 2002, and loved every second of it. It's the kind of joyful, emotional, honest, straightforward musical that Hollywood used to make (but hasn't made in a million years).There's also more to it than simple fun. The characters and acting are deeper than expected and the story of colonialism and caste systems is intriguing and relevant today.I plan to purchase the DVD because this is a fantastic movie."
4,Liked the movie,"Good thing I have a VHS. I bought this item without paying attention to the fact that it was a vhs, but the movie was wonderful. I really enjoyed it."
5,Fantastic Movie,Lagaan is a fantastic movie. Aamir Khan is an amazing actor and this movie is definitely one that you should have in your collection.During the postage the bonus disc had come out of it's holder so had a few light scratches on it from rubbing over the middle holder but it still works fine.
5,"""He who has truth and courage in his heart...","always wins in the end.""The message of the movie is universal: don't go away in the final round. You've worked so hard thus far. Believe!WOW, but the amazing thing about the movie is --like all good movies--- you CAN'T BELIEVE... until it goes through!It feels great to watch it.Yes, it's long. I'm not sure how long it is, but I watched it in three parts.Just like a long, good book! Like one of those great classic books!The songs are beautiful!!It's beautiful.Can't we just watch more movies like these?It's gorgeous, don't miss it, my friend."
5,Lagaan- A Bollywood film to Watch,"Oh, thank God it's here! I can't wait to own it! I have seen this film, the middle, begginning, and end at least three times and each each time i have i love it even more! This film is so much better than those other ""love triangle"" Hindi films I have seen. The music will sweep you away, the cinamatography is enchanting, and, as one viewer noted, the hero Bhuvan is both handsome and endearing! His songs with Gauri are so beautiful I nearly cried! His ""gung-ho"" attitude to rally his friends is inspring and infectuous! It made me long to be in the game with them, or at least on the side line cheering them on! The songs are also marvelous. It is too bad I do not speak Hindi, with this film, you find yourself wanting to join in! My favorite ones are ""Let's Walk Ahead"" and ""Why Is Radha Jealous."" For those of you who want a good old fashioned epic film, this is the one you CANNOT MISS! Namaste to all you Bollywood lovers out there and enjoy!"
1,"Wonderful film, BAD DVD",Bought this DVD with great expectations of being able to see a film I saw years ago and loved. Too bad this DVD won't play on the DVD players we have in the US. BIG disappointment.
4,Lagaan's Impact,I first watched this movie my freshman year of high school. It had a great impact on my life. I provided a deeper look into the Indian culture and inspired many projects and research. I am now in my senior year of college and I am going to be an Elementary School Teacher. I believe this can provide an effective lesson with older elementary school students to be more welcoming to other cultures.
1,Good movie poorly produced DVDs,"It frustrates me when I take time to explain a problem and the vendor does not even read it and blames someting else on the problem. I am trying to give them important feedback and they ignore it. I sent an email to vendor (forwarded to AMAZON) explaining the problem. Reading their email back to me tells me they did not read my email to them!The DVD DOES PLAY... parts of both DVD's do not have complete English subtitles. Some of the DVD has english subtitles. WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT IT IS NOT MY DVD PLAYER. The DVD's were not properly produced for complete English subtitles:1. One can view the entire movie with English subtitles2. None of the extras after the movie have subtitles, with no choice button for same.3. The Second DVD has absolutely no subtitles with no choice button for same.Finally: A very good movie, overly long by American standards. DVD producers blew it on doing complete English subtitle availability.Movies are in Hindi."
2,Not the best of Bollywood,"I am married with an woman origanally from India. Therefore been able to see Bollywood movies, even more then i wanted. But i have come to enjoy some of the Bollywood movies. Lagaan was definitally NOT one of them.If you are looking for a first time experience with Indian Bollywood movies i guess Lagaan will not give you the best of Bollywood movies which are around. It gives you some highlights of Indian Movie making with great scenery, dancing and music. But the storyline, is even for Bollywood movies standard, incredible weak. The second part of the movie shows a cricket match where all Indians cooperate to beat the evil British Empire (in a cricket match!)...it's boring, totally unbelievable, not funny, patriotic and therefore a waste of time.If you want to have your first time good bollywood experience, try movies like: ""Bombay"" or ""Monsoon Wedding"""
2,"Pretty, and pretty racist","It's a beautiful film, and if you like Bollywood musicals this one has some wonderful choreography. The story is absurd, and probably shouldn't be taken any more seriously than a Gilbert & Sullivan operetta, but even so its version of the Raj is utterly skewed. More importantly, the portrayal of the British ""baddies"", especially Cpt. Russell, plays on every racist stereotype of an Anglo-Saxon ""whitey"" (to use the subtitle's term) ever divised. It's a shame Aamir Khan felt that this otherwise-enthralling movie had to cater to the cheapest and most offensive prejudices of his original audience."
5,Fantabulous....,"certainly,one of the best movies ever to come out of india...have seen it thrice and can watch it again....."
2,Very Good Movie - Damaged DVD,"Lagaan is a very good Indian musical. We have never, though, been able to watch the movie all the way to the end. This is now the second DVD of this movie that we have purchased that has been damaged. Only the first three quarters of the movie are playable. It could be the case that all of the DVDs made from the original are damaged. If anyone finds a copy of this movie that is playable in its entirety that would be a real find."
5,a Raj Kumari Great Raja film An Eros Entertainment Special,I heard of lagaan in Decmber 2000 on sony entertainment channel. I havent seen it but i know its about cricket. its suposed to good. NOT AAMIR KHAN'S IDEA. I MADE IT UP iT IS GOOD THAT I CALL IT A Raj Kumari Boah Saris (very fine) Great Raja Ko Rani film. Best of all it is an Eros Entertainment Special Presentation. By Mr. congeniality Hanumange Raja Ko Rani Kumar
1,HUGE disappointment,"If I could give this book a rating of zero, I would. First of all, it has the ugliest designs I have ever seen, and I love Asian designs. Also all the graphs are printed so small that you certainly couldn't use any of them for stitching. However, the author does provide black and white graphs at the end of the book to be photocopied and enlarged for stitching. All designs are charted for Anchor floss, with only one general conversion table given at the end of the book for DMC. The author does also give floss estimates, a materials-required list, and minimal instructions for making up each project."
1,Made in columbia,"When i ordered it the product description said made in england but i was surprised when i received the product which was made in columbia.The made in columbia one was defective,surface was rough,print was not clear and did not match my existing chirchill china ""Made in england set"".I asked for a replacement from amazon and told them to send me the one that is Made in england.Looks like the made in columbia churchill china has serious quality issues and not worth ."
2,For a narrow audience only,"If you are new to the tool but have any experience with graphics packages than this book is not the right one for you. It provides excrutiating step by step details of many different projects which is fine if you are learning your way around this class of program. But if you don't need the hand holding on each menu operation and are looking instead to learn what sort of things the tool can do and the basic techniques to do it, a book like the Painter Wow series is a much better investment.Reading the other reviews, there must be a reasonable audience for people who like this approach but I caution people to consider just what type of instruction they are looking for before buying this.To put it in perspective, this was the first book I purchased with Painter. I struggled with the format and content, finding it most unengaging and finally purchased the Wow book. After that arrived, the Creativity has been firmly lodged on the bookshelf."
1,Not exactly what I thought it would be....,"Don't get me wrong, I liked this book. From the reviews on Amazon.com that I read, it sounded great--but nobody mentioned that all the rituals practices for the sabbats in this book are written for covens of 4+ people. I myself have found almost no use for it, as a solitary. Oh well. I may give it to a friend who could find better use for it than I."
2,I sent it back!,"This book was nothing like I thought it was going to be! I thought it was going to be a complete Book of Shadows. Instead it only dealt with the Sabbats. That's not complete. It only presented the Sabbats in a ritual format that could be used for a cove. What about solitaires? Also, it was dry and boring. A tedious read. The only redeeming quality was the brief God and Goddess names and bios."
1,Really Good Book,I had this book years ago and I was delighted to find it again.It has been very very useful for my lyceum at The Muse as well as personal work.Thank you.BlessingsMana From The Temple of the Muse
1,Not really portable,"I purchased this Lexar USB drive because data protection feature. However, it is totally useless for me. In order to keep your data secured on the memory, you 'must' install it's software on every single computer you use. Most of the time, I cannot do that since I don't have administrative rights on most computers I use. (School / Office computer)Lexar did not post this information on its website. I wouldn't have purchased this drive if I knew this.The word 'portable' should be removed from its name."
1,"Great on XP, Nothing on 2000","Got my drive at home and set it up on an XP Pro box. Worked like a charm...The security program ran in the background and was easy to set up. Took it to work and plugged it into my Win 2000 box and absolutely nothing but problems. The JDSecure 2.0 program would say it couldn't find a jump drive (tried direct and through a hub), when it did find it the only option it would give was to reformat it. Tech support sent me the JDSecure 3.0 beta to try, no help. Sent the drive back, they said they fixed the problem...Got the drive back, plugged it into the 2000 box and same problems. Now that I've wasted several days on something so simple I think I'll stick to FTP."
5,Virtuosity at programming,Ages ago my instructor at the local university computing center gave me this book. After completing all etudesI was accepted as an apprentice programmer at age fourteen. This is an exceptional book! It teaches you to think like a programmer. Unfortunately it has been out of print for more than a decade.
3,Has Definite Drawbacks,"This album has a good educational format. It uses repetition and promotes generalization of the learning targets. The vocabulary and basic language are great for young children. The songs are nice. The major drawback for me is that it teaches Spanish with VERY distinct accent, making it much less universal. This is not the album you would want to start with if you or your child wanted a much more common Spanish accent. I wouldn't buy it again."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"I bought the CD for my 4 year old son. I have played it on a couple of occasions; however, he is not interested and tells me he wants to listen to something else."
2,not NEARLY AS GREAT AS FUN SPANISH,"If you are looking for one CD to help your kids learn Spanish, don't get this one, get BETH MANNERS FUN SPANISH FOR KIDS. This one misses many opportunities to teach Spanish--there are whole songs done only in English, not to mention some rather strange and drippy information about Spain, Columbus etc. Even on an imaginary tour of Spain one learns mostly obscure words--for instance the Spanish word for creme brulee. I'm sure your 7 year old need to know that one! On the other hand FUN SPANISH is a complete joy, and teaches MUCH of this same material plus a whole lot more. I just don't think there's any comparison between the two. My daughter likes this fine, but nine times out of ten she'll request the FUN SPANISH tape-- she loves the Goldilocks story told in Spanish."
3,Not as hoped,"I bought this for my children 6 & 7, who were interested in learning more spanish. My 6 year old seemed to enjoy it more than my 7 year old. The CD moved along too quickly at times & some words were hard to understand. So, we were not sure we were actually speaking the words correctly. Not very helpful if you're a beginner."
3,I agree that Fun Spanish and Magic Spanish are better,"My kids liked Fun Spanish and Magic Spanish a lot, but did not like this CD very much. My kids are 3 and 5. They would not listen to even half the CD. It did not hold their interest.I think Fun Spanish is slightly better than Magic Spanish."
3,Not as good as her other CD,"I purchased this CD, as well as ""Beth Manners' Magic Spanish for Kids"", and while we listen to them both - this one is not as entertaining. Her other CD follows a story format, where the teaching happens a little more subconsciously. With this CD, however, the lessons are a little more out-in-the-open, and to be honest, a little more boring. That said, there are no grammatical errors, it's a combination of English and Spanish, and the pronunciation is accurate. A good addition to an already established collection."
4,Very Cute,"Borrowed from library. Very cute and within three times of listening, my five year old was walking up to people, saying Hola, and asking their names and how they were doing in Spanish. Many answered him back and he would continue when they asked him his name and how he was doing. I was impressed. Wish there were more CDs or more songs to this one. Some of the punctuation and enunciation is hard because different than what I am used to; but got the ideas across. Very good."
3,I agree - the other one is better,"After an introduction to Spanish, my students really enjoy CD's - especially ones that feature ""real "" conversations or catchy songs. This one is pretty good, but I agree with the other reviewers, the vocabulary that is focused on does not go as well with other textbooks or curriculum, and so is not reinforcing or building confidence near as much as it could. I recommend Hop Skip and Sing as well (by Ana Lomba) but it's a little young for my 6 year old already.As with all CD's, I do recommend flash cards or something to go along with it, to help concrete the information and the experience. Immersion works, but only after a foundation (however small) has been built. Presenting the target language (Spanish in this case) in many formats will produce better results, faster, and longer lasting!Sra. GoseAuthor of Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 1 & Flip Flop Spanish Flash Cards: Verde (Cards)"
5,"Wow, it really works!!","My child (5 years old) is learning so much Spanish - this is a very innovative concept. The CDs teach spanish by directing my child in many fun activities - such as setting the table and playing restaurant, using finger puppets- Bobby and Maria to learn greetings and interacting with the plush animals. My child is very engaged. Plus on the DVD there are stories - completely in Spanish to reinforce the vocabulary. Very interactive - it constantly prompts you to speak. Lots of songs too, which again reinforce the vocabulary and phrases. Well worth the money -you get so much and it is nice to be away from the computer screen and do age appropriate and tactile learning."
3,Beth Manners' Fun Spanish for kids,"This cd was just ok, my kid likes it and like any other cd she has, she sings along.I really can't say much else, nothing to rave about,it was just ok."
3,Has lots of english. Only good in the car,"I got this when my daughter was 2.5yrs and had a good start on spanish already. She liked it, but I hoped it would teach her more (and me too). It's really only good for car rides, not at home. It won't keep her attention at home."
1,Too hard to follow,"I found this product fairly useless and hard to follow. We listened to it in the car, but were very disappointed. The Spanish was too fast and the previous reviewer was correct: too much English. At least I didn't pay any money for it. It was a gift from a well-intentioned mother-in-law."
4,Wonderful cd but not necessarily the most common Spanish pronunciation,"We love this cd and will probably purchase the other Manners Spanish disc, but I do struggle with the fact that this is not the Spanish that the other kids around here speak. The pronunciation is not that of Mexico or Spain, but instead is more Peruvian or Argentinian. It would be great to have an alternate of this same program with the other pronunciation. Other than that aspect, it's by far the best kids Spanish cd we've owned."
4,Catchy Tunes,My 3 year old loves the songs. He always asks me to put the Hola Bobby CD on in the car.
3,Some catchy tunes but really could use written translation guide,"My 3 yr old doesn't like it, though I've played it for her several times to get her ""used"" to it. She tells me to turn it off. Personally, I've learned a few small phrases like ""comemos naranjas"" but the problem is, there is no guide to tell you what's being said or what it means. There is a small insert that translates the songs - but the songs only comprise about half of the CD. There's a long segment on the Three Bears that is somewhat annoying - we did learn one phrase that sticks with us - Todo Terminado (all finished), which is pretty much how we feel about this CD."
4,Good crusher. Exactly what I expected.,"After reading the other reviews I decided on this ice crusher for my husband. (He loves crushed ice.) It has been a huge hit. This small machine will crush a glass full of ice in a minute or two and when put in his chilled mug, it lasts longer than what he's drinking. As an added bonus, my girls like making snow cones out of the crushed ice. The only drawback is that I wish the ice was chopped into slightly bigger pieces. Some of the pieces are so small that they melt a little too fast and I don't get the pleasure of chomping it! But~We highly recommend this product!"
2,One Ice Cube......,"I had read some other reviews about the machine taking only one ice cube at a time. Others said it worked fine so I ordered it. Well, it will only take one ice cube at a time so it makes it a pain to use. If I had it to do again I would order a different one."
1,Not Worth Trying,"I put ice in it, turned it on and it hummed like a stalled electric motor, like a fan blade stuck on your fan. Shook it and tried again, same result. Tried again and it took off. Spent 10 minutes trying to make it work, and in the end it gave me slush. NOT CRUSHED ICE!"
1,Sad little thing..,"In the past year we have had 5 of these little ice crushers. It is very cheaply made and the blades have broken on every on of these 5 units. We simply take it back where we bought it and they give us another one. Well, that store no longer sells this ice maker so the last one goes in the trash. It is (was) also very loud and will only crush one or two small cubes of ice at a time."
2,No crush on this crusher,"This ice crusher does a good enough job if you like ice chunks that are smaller than a pea. The ice melts very fast in your drink but keeps it quite cold for a short time. The hopper is not nearly large enough which makes the processing of ice for just a few drinks a long process. Sometimes the blades get jammed inside of the grinder, necessitating unplugging the unit and fishing around in the difficult to access hopper with a utensil to dislodge the ice which is jammed. I recommend a manual ice chopper for the right sized crushed ice with very little fuss."
2,Don't bother,"I like chopped ice for slushie type drinks and this machine chops them to the perfect size. That's the good news. The bad news is this machine is very loud, only takes one cube at a time and now it's making a grinding metal to metal noise and I'm sure I will be throwing it out soon. This unit is about 2-3 months old. There are way better choices than this one. -UPDATE- It finally broke. I lost the receipt and thought I would try another. It worked for a a couple weeks and the exact same thing happened! The same grinding noise and then complete failure. This has to be a known problem with these. I really wanted this to work good and it did, but not for very long."
1,Did not work for me,"Maybe it's the ice my refrigerator makes (you know, the typical rectangular domed shaped), but all the ice would do was jump around in the machine and not crush. I tried putting fewer cubes it, did not work. Then I tried putting a lot of cubes in, still didn't work. So, for the first time ever, I returned something to Amazon. The unit is also much smaller than I thought it was. The book said it would crush about 14 oz of ice per minute. I get much faster results from my blender. I was not impressed."
2,Not worth all the noise.,"It only crushes one (!) ice cube at a time, which seems pretty foolish. Perhaps if you're patient you'll eventually have enough crushed ice, but I found the design too frustrating."
3,One Cube Only,"This does a good job crushing the ice; however, it will only crush one cube of ice at a time (per instructions that came with the crusher)."
4,A WELL-MADE PRODUCT,"This ice crusher has plenty of power and is efficient enough to convert a tray of ice cubes to sno-cone sized material in only a couple of minutes. I would like to see a model this well designed but allowing adjustability of the size of the crush, since I only wanted an ice cube divided into 3 or 4 smaller pieces. Not all bad, though--now I can produce a Scotch Mist in my own kitchen!"
1,Worst electrical appliance I ever bought,"I bought this to replace a manual ice crusher, and it is absolutely terrible. It gets jammed, it's slower than the manual, it has a tiny capacity, it is slow. P.U. I recommend ANYTHING else, like holding the ice cube in your hand and whacking it with a spoon."
1,Great if you're looking for an Ice Crusher that doesn't crush ice,"I bought one of these for a party I was having - figuring that way I'd always have plenty of crushed ice for my mint juleps.It worked really well at first, ice cubes went in, crushed ice came out, well, as long as you only put 1 or 2 cubes in at a time. More than 3 ice cubes? Forget it, it would jam and you'd have to unplug it, unjam it and try again.So then, as the party wore on, mind you, the thing was not running constantly, it refused to crush the ice even if you put just 1 ice cube in there.In short - Total piece of junk and you're better off with a bag of ice from the grocery store and a sledge hammer."
1,VERY disappointed!,"From other reviews, I was expecting the Deni ice crusher to be fantastic! Mine came today and I have crushed ""maybe"" a dozen cubes and it has stopped - only hums!Needless to say, mine will be going back TOMORROW!"
2,Faulty product,"The ice crusher only lasted 4 weeks. The motor apparently burned up. My 88 year mother was the only user and followed the directions carefully.It was too late to return to Amazon. Waiting on an exchange from the manufacturer. We had to pay shipping for return, which was not really fair. This make me leary of buying products on the internet."
4,Really great!,"I love crushed ice so after not having crushed ice in my fridge door (just cubes) I was determined to find an inexpensive unit to give me my crushed ice. Well I am loving this great little machine! It's so nice to have all the crushed ice I want when I want it. Very easy to use & the ice is crushed so nice, small & uniform...no big chunks. This is awesome & let me tell you, I've been enjoying a lot of crushed ice since buying this. My husband & son are liking it too. Now my best friend says she's gonna get one too!"
5,Ice Crusher,I love my ice crusher. I use it every day when I make my smoothies. It is user friendly. I recommend this product to anyone without a built in ice crusher in their refrigerator.
2,Not Dependable,I have received two Deni 6100 ice crushers in the past 45 days and one was defective upon receipt (which I returned) and the replacement became defective after using it about 30 days. I would not recommend this product.
1,Slow and too fine,This product will only handle a few cubes of ice at a time at best and is fairly slow. It is not a heavy duty unit at all.If you want fine crushed ice that's what you get. I somehow was under the impression that the chunks would be a little larger.I prefer small chunks myself and this unit will not do that.
4,6100 steel ice crusher,"The crusher was heavy duty in structure . It hesitated and/or stopped many times during the crushing process . after stopping several times , due to ice jamming inside container , I learned to pick up and shake it so it would continue crushing .[ Shaking seemed to dislodge the ice blocks ]."
1,Not a Crowd Pleaser!,Don't understand how a company can make such a useless item as this so called ice crusher. It is laughable as the machine can only handle just one cube at a time. It takes forever and the ice is pulverized not merely crushed! We looked at the reviews and it sounded good. We only wanted it for two martinis not a crowd. Sent back immediately!
5,Grandmommie loves her ice crusher,"We bought the Deni 6100 Ice Crusher for my mother-in-law for mother's day. I just called to see how she likes it. She said, ""It is wonderful!"" I use it about 3 times a day. I just leave a glass under it and it's ready. I especially like it when I take my last drink before bed. Rate it the highest. I love it!"" So, there you have it from an 85 year old grandmother!"
2,Life didn't improve.,Another thing on the counter top. No control over output size. One cube at a time and it spits back at me.
3,Ice Crusher Review,"Great little ice crusher, no big jobs for this one. It would be nice if it was able to crush a little larger peices, awfully small crush. But other than that it is nice."
2,Did not work,"I was so excited to receive the ice crusher but after I read the instructions and put it together, it did not work. The blades would not move at all to crush the ice. The ice sat in the chamber and was starting to melt. I re-read the instructions and saw that I did everything right. Still did not work. I packaged it up and mailed it back to the manufacturer and I hope that I get one that works this time. I was extremely disappointed because this was, I thought, a new machine. I am hoping to get a replacement soon."
3,Deni 6100 Ice Crusher,"I like the ice crusher. It works really well with only one ice cube inserted at a time. It is slow doing only one ice cube at a time, but it is a small appliance."
1,Not worth the money,"Don't buy this item!!!!It takes F-O-R-E-V-E-R to crush the ice, and it can't crush more than one cube at a time. This item sucks, just get the Warring ice crusher for like 20 more bucks."
3,Good for the limited capability,"While the Deni 6100 replaced a 50's hand-crank crusher, it is limited by the fact that it is not adjustable and crushes ice to a relatively fine size, smaller than our old hand style that had 3 settings. There is a spring-loaded trap door where you insert the ice cubes and sometimes it catches a cube, but is no big deal. Watch out for 'counter flooding' from where the crushed ice collects inside the the outlet (where you cannot see it). While most of the ice falls into a clear plastic container the ice that remains in the crusher can result in a considerable amount water dripping onto the base as it melts if you do not replace the container. Also, the shape of the container is a bit awkward, as it can stick. It looks rather space-age and is compact so it does not take up much space (although it is probably not an appliance that tends to find a permanent place on the counter). Oh, yeah! It is fairly loud and sounds like something is breaking (which it is)."
1,Surprised,"The product crushes ice as stated, but they recommend only to crush 1 ice cube at a time. Can you imagine how long it takes to crush enough ice for 1 drink? By the time all the ice is crushed, most of what was already crushed has melted."
2,Ergonomic nightmare,"This does chop up ice into sizes I want.However:You put a single ice cube in the machine. They suggest using the door lever so you can insert the ice. It immediately explodes during chopping. Apparently, you are supposed to, with lightning agility, replace a cap over the chute for the top of the unit.Then you repeat this procedure.Do not, under any circumstances, put a cube in with your face over the chute...you may end up with an injury.Just my observation. It works...but beware."
2,Deni 6100 Automatic Ice Crusher,"The problem with this product is that it will only crush one ice cube at a time, which information is not in the description. Needless to say it isn't good for making drinks in volume. Also, it has to be shut off before inserting each ice cube. A child should definitely not operate this product."
2,Stopped working after only 4 months,"I bought this for my mother, who loves eating crushed ice. It worked great for approximately 4 months and then the motor locked up and it stopped working. I'll order a more heavy duty one in the future."
1,It won't last!,I have purchased 2 of these in the past year and both times they jammed and broke. I did not overload the ice. I think it is an inferior product and a waste of money.
1,Not worth it,Very loud and did not chop or crush the ice. Jumped all over the counter when on. Would not buy a small one again.
2,ICE CRUSHER DENI 6100,"VERY LITE WEIGHT ,NOISEY. JUMPS AROUND.NOT NEAR AS GOOD AS EXPECTED. IN BELIEVE THAT THER ARE BETTER CHOISES OUT THERE.THIS ICE CRUSHER GIVES THE ICE A BAD FLAVOR.I HAD THOUGHT THAT AFTER SOME USE AND CLEANING IT THE BAD TASTE WOULD GO AWAY BUT IT HAS NOT. WOULD NOT WISH THIS ON ANY OTHER PERSON."
1,This thing struggles,This machine jams regularly. You can only feed a few cubes at a time. It would honestly be easier to use a mallet and ziplock.I have had other ice crushers. This one really STINKS!
3,OK for the price,"It's not as good a PaintShop Pro, but you can't expect much for a low price. I wouldn't purchase it again."
2,Corel Snapfire Plus,"Picassa, part of the Google suite of programs, is both better than this program and free! What more do I need to add? The user interface of Picassa is easier to use and more responsive."
1,Corel Snapfire plus,"I think we got duped. This cd does even give us the product. The Snapfire plus ""cannot be recognized."" We have a very good Dell computer and it is all up to date. We have added and removed the program three times... still not recognized and able to use.We will try one more time... if still does not ""READ"" we will be returning to Amazon.Not recommended"
4,Very nice problems!,""" A chess problem is a position arranged to illustrate an interesting chess idea, which frequently is based on some particular characteristics of the various men employed.""This book contanis 155 selected chess problems, any chess enthusiast will love them.Warning: chess problems don't increase your tactical skills if you want to improve your tactical vision, try 1001 Chess Sac. and Comb. by F. Reinfeld."
4,An American Icon,"This book is a great introduction to the many talented American composers of the turn of the century. In a style that is easy to read and understand, this book presents a well researched portrait of the main chess problem composers born or living in America. A good introduction to the art of chess problem composing and solving."
4,Another Good Book of Chess Problems,"Great book with interesting problems although ""The Puzzle King: Sam Loyd's Chess Problems and Selected Mathematical Puzzles"" is more comprehensive with chess problems of greater complexity I tend to rotate between both along with [...] and Shredder daily chess problems. Still, a great addition to my chess library."
1,Brown Tonquin Dinnerware,"I so loved these dishes so I ordered them in Brown. When they came, they sent me the Blue but I sent them back, I wanted the Brown. They again shipped me another set but they were also in Blue! I sent them back and waited, finally they notified me that this was a larger problem then they thought and they would not be able to fill my order, I was refunded my money. I was so disappointed, I really wanted them and I was kind of disgusted that I had to keep shipping them back and forth thinking that I would eventually get what I wanted. I'm sure I would have loved them, thanks anyway."
3,Hallmark TV Classics Collection II,"Although I enjoy most these Hallmark movies and I have purchased two other collections I didn't buy this one due to price. Almost two hundred dollars is a bit ridiculous for five movies, two of which are worth maybe twenty a piece, and the other three would do good to get fifteen each. Last time I checked thats eighty-five which is a far cry from the price here. I guess I will buy the three I want individually unless I see a substancial price drop here. All these are available one place or another and you can bet if any one is temporarily out of print, Hallmark will make more copies, probably in Blu-ray so you will get a sharper picture and sound. Good quality DVDs with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Hallmark Collector Set V.1 (6-Movies"" and ""Hallmark Collector Set V.2 (6-Movies)"" at a much better price.CA Luster"
4,Very good tale of human endurance,"Beautiful scenery and cinematography. You know how it ends since it is peppered with commentary from the people upon which the film is based, but it holds your interest because you wonder how exactly they could possibly it. The interviews are honest and compelling."
3,Simpson's Void,"""Touching the Void"" is indeed a remarkable story of survival. Joe Simpson's ordeal is vividly recaptured by director Kevin McDonald. McDonald's rather straightforward style, with the real Joe Simpson and Simon Yates recounting their harrowing experience climbing, and then descending, the beautiful but brutal, Suila Grande, in the Peruvian Andes, works well here. If there is hole in this story, and I think there is, it's in Simpson himself. He's one cold fish, so it's hard to work up a real measure of empathy. You half expect him to quote Nietzsche at some point. No doubt he would tell you this bleak attitude toward life and death is what kept him going. Maybe, but you get the sense that this heroic effort is being told by a mechanical man - and he was that way before Simpson cut the rope. The only time I really felt for Simpson, was when he fell into delirium, and was plagued with memories of a bad song. It's only then that his control slips, and seems human at last."
2,Quality--Touching the Void,"Even though the DVD arrived promptly, which I appreciated, it has stuck at the beginning and in numerous other places. It it not in an acceptable conditon. I do understand that the shipper offers a 100% back guarantee, but if I have to pay shipping, it's not worth it to return it. I do understnad that the shipper offers a 100% guarantee, and I have yet to follow up on that. So, this review might be a bit premature, but this has been my experience so far."
1,Re: Touching the Void DVD,"DVD froze the entire time not viewable. Cheap is not always better. too bad, i heard movie was outstanding. Mary C, Torrance, CA"
2,Two stupid guys risk their lives for no reason,"This might have made a good thirty minute documentary and not a two hour movie. Think of this as a more expensive edition of ""Jackass,"" the MTV show where idiotic guys do dangerous activities for laughs and thrills. It is difficult for me to be at all sympathetic about two men who engage in a mindlessly, very dangerous and irrational activity such as mountain climbing. When one of the characters breaks his leg and fears that he will die, my only response was, ""what did you expect?"" Two idiots playing russian roulette with a loaded gun would have been just as uninvolving as this movie was. I nominate these two jerks for the annual Darwin awards - the awards given out to people whose stupid activities and choices eliminate their DNA from the gene pool."
5,A Documentary That Really Gets Your Attention,"You can read the synopsis anywhere, so I'll save you the time and just say that this film was EXCELLENT. The story is a good one to start with, but it's the interaction between the actual people and the location that sets it apart. Make sure you watch the ""Return To Siula"" featurette. It really pulls the film together at an emotional level that's not often achieved.This movie was so good that I rented it first; then still bought it. That doesn't happen very often."
5,"incredible film, incredible story, incredible dvd extras","Directed by Kevin MacDonald, this film relates the harrowing experiences of two young British climbers who, in 1985, attempted to climb Peru's Siula Grande, a mountain that had already defeated other climbing teams. After a difficult ascent, the two found real trouble as they attempted to return to their base when Joe Simpson broke his leg. When Simon Yates was later criticized for his actions during the climb, Simpson wrote a book to defend his friend and set the record straight, even dedicating the book to his colleague. Narrated by Yates and Simpson and intercut with reenactments on Siula Grande by actors, this documentary/drama is exciting and gripping. DVD extras are also exceptional: a 23-minute making-of featurette; a 25-minute, Return to Siula Grande; the 10-minute What Happened Next?; and a trailer. The film can be heard in English and subtitled in English or Spanish.Higly recommended."
5,"Excellent movie, interesting format",This is without a doubt the best climbing film I have seen. It is realistic and vividly and honestly shows the emotional state of the climbers thoughout. Joe and Simon seem to have no problem making very un-flattering statements about how they felt and what decisions they made.This is no hollywood film ... the experience just isn't something you could make up - but the production values are still first notch and the 'alternating narrative and reenactment' format really reminds you that these are real people and this is truely what they went through.
4,very compelling,Once you start to watch this you will not be able to stop.Great winter time watch to get you through until you can get out again
5,Touching the Void finally a true climbing film.,"I to will save you another synopsis. I am a climber, when I was very young I also had a bad accident very similar to this where I broke both my legs. This movie is the only movie that I have seen where people really get a chance to feel what it is like. The grandeur of being up high in the mountains seeing how BIG everything is. It was hard for me to watch, but that is good it shows its a great film. For people who want to watch a great docu-drama, as another reviewer put it, or if you want to see what mountaineering is like, both before the accident and after (unfortunately), get this film it is fabulous! Bravo!"
3,The game is free to play...soon,Before buying this card be sure to go to the official website. The game is going to a free to play model in the fall. So maybe this is a good deal for the VIP accounts though.
1,Seriously overpriced Time Card,"my rating is on the price, $40 a month? you have got to be kidding me. If you Buy through Turbine or buying a time card at places like Best Buy its $15 a month, if you wait for one of their deals you can start paying $9.99 a month. Something is seriously wrong with this pricing. Unless there are about 3 or 4 2month cards this is a REALLY bad deal."
3,Guitar parts ONLY!,"Maybe I recieved a different version of this book than the one reviewed previously, but mine is GUITAR transcriptions and TAB only!! No bass, no drums and no keyboards! I feel very misled by the description and the review. I give it three stars ONLY because it is a great album, and the music has been with me for 30 years now. But I am very disappointed in the book. As a bassist, it is useless to me."
4,Adventure stories,I loved the series on Young Iniana Jones and I have enjoyed the series. So of it is pretty far fetched on who he meets but the characters are always interesting. The nice thing about this is the extras you get with the series. You get the life stories of all the true adventures of the actual people. The stories are informative and you learn about legends in their own field. In this series an example is you learn about the director John Ford. This is a good introduction to history for the adult and child alike. If you like history around the time of the First world war this will be a great addition to your collection.
5,Young Indy,Loved all three volumnes; don't know why it is not on TV as are the Indiana Jones movies. These volumnes would be a great teaching aid in history for kid/teens as they do not seem to know anything about history and geography. Parents...do get these for you kids!
5,The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones Volume Three,The years of change give a whole new perspective of Indy. Indy grows from the war years as a soldier to the full blown adventurer of Indiana Jones. I wish there were more episodes on DVD!
1,Youn Indiana Volume Three,"Rubbish. I got caught up in the hype for Indy 4, so I brought these dvds when they were on special. I watched about 30 mins for disc 1 before I turned it off. I had not seen the series before and it was not what I thought it would be."
5,This series sure beats watching television!,I have thoroughly enjoyed the Young Indiana Jones series . . . each segment is well done and so much superior to the television viewing now available! I would recommend this series as excellent family viewing since each segment involves history and well known historical figures and the actors and actresses are are quality performers. In my opinion this series is a good investment if you enjoy well done and entertaining family action movies.
1,Jorma Lite At Best,"For what it's worth, the album is just average at best. Pete is like a really weak version of his brother Jorma on a bad day. It's ok, but I'd much rather hear Hoppkorv or any of Hot Tuna's mid 70s stuff ANYDAY. Or Jorma's 70s solo material.Funny how Peter never recorded another solo album after this one, at least on any kind of major label. Sure says alot about his (lack of) talent. Riding on his brother's legend and little more."
2,Jorma Kaukonen in a bad day,"There is just one good song on this album: the song ""THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION"", the others are just an ugly copy of Jimi Hendrix stile of playing, and the voice sucks like the hell.This album is not a very good one: Peter Kaukonen is known just because of his brother Jorma, not because of is talent.He has no style, no rithm feel and his guitar sound is always dirty, both electric and acoustic."
1,"THIS IS A BOOTLEG, DO NOT BUY!!",This is a bootleg!! Do not buy from this person. They are selling illegal recordings. If you want to buy this item the only way to buy it legitimately is from the artist himself. Go to PeterKaukonen.com and purchase this item from his web site. If you do not buy it this way it is a bootleg and therefore illegal to sell and the artist receives no money and criminals like this seller get richer.
4,Hard Rock and Hard Message,"Here is another collection of hard to get music with a great message. A must for your collection. The music of this group is difficult to find, when you do, you should grab it up while it is in your grasp."
1,Doesn't get hot enough to make a decent cheese sandwich...,"I bought this iron to replace an old low-end iron, which rusted out. I thought all I really cared about was to put an end to the yellow rust stains, but it's far less frustrating to use the old iron with a mister bottle alongside, than it is to steam with this one.It simply does not get hot enough to iron cotton quilting cottons and handkerchiefs, and it also takes far too long to get up to its max temperature.I would forgive the fact that the steam holes are huge and catch on everything, and the fact that it's needlessly heavy, if only it actually ironed. For what it's worth, though, the transparent reservoir is quite nice.I'll go shell out the big bucks for the Rowenta, I think. Lesson learned."
5,B&D BATTERY,The battery I purchased is performing as expected. I would expect nothing less from a B&D product.
5,Fighter Pilot songs from Viet Nam,"Toby writes fighter pilot stories in song in the manner that Tom T Hall and Johnnie Cash were story tellers. He tells of his experiences flying with the 12th TFW assigned to Cam Rhan Bay, RVN during the 1967 - 68 era. During that time the operating area for the F-4C Phantom ranged from the tip of the Mekong delta in the south to Laos and the southern part of North Viet Nam in the north. The songs describe the many types of missions flown on a daily and nightly basis by the air crews. Even if you don't know the ""lingo"" or the acronyms, you will understand and enjoy the storys and songs. This is a ""MUST HAVE"" for any one who flew in Nam or as a gift for any friends who had the experience. Hopefully this work will be included in any archived history of the Viet Nam war. An excellent work."
4,great! loved it!,"this is a wonderful book. it is short yet refreshing, in a beautiful telling of a boy who must leave his country he leaves on foot with her parents Fish a donkey and Guide. he home is ripped away he faces trials that many children would run from this is an adventure that is realistic and reminds us of how much the little kids can teach us. Though it is about a child i do not recamended it for young children"
4,Through the eyes of a Missionary Kid,"I was skeptical when I picked up this book, but it soon got ahold of me. A great afternoon read, and an excellent read-aloud for your children. Told through the eyes of a child but with great insight."
3,Natalie Wood at nineteen,"Pretty Marjorie Morganstern, a good Jewish girl, gets her chance to work with a summer-stock company at the summer camp where she is a counselor on her first job. She meets older, charismatic Noel Airman, the summer-stock director that is nearing the end of an always promising career. Marjorie encourages Noel to pursue his theatrical dreams and when he fails, he leaves Marjorie with a broken heart. Noel does the only thing that makes him feel success and adoration and Marjorie comes to terms that her love affair with Noel was the greatest love of her life. I don't want to give away the ending, but get your tissues ready."
5,Marjorie Morningstar; an old favorite,"Marjorie Morningstar is an old favorite of mine. Another one of Natalie Wood's movies that I adore. Probably appeals most to girls/women at the age of ""just starting to fall in love"" and older. A classic."
2,Seriously Dated,"Although the performers are competent and pleasing, this film is seriously dated. Wouk's novel was powerful for its honest portrayal of its Jewish milieu, something the film does not understand or appreciate. The ending is particularly dated and trivial. Wouk's narrative should have been followed."
1,Marjorie Morningstink,"As a huge fan of the novel and of Natalie Wood, I had high expectations for the film. Natalie Wood is believable as the plucky young Marjorie; however, the woeful miscasting of Gene Kelly destroys any hopes of making this film even passably enjoyable. Herman Wouks' Noel Airman is in his late twenties, irresistibly sexy and crushingly sardonic. Using the bloated, aging Kelly in this role makes the viewer question Marjorie's intelligence and objectives. The supposedly geeky Wally Wronken is obviously more attractive than Kelly, who plays Noel not as a frustrated ne'er-do-well, but as an embittered man far past his prime. Further miscasting of the pert Carolyn Jones as slovenly Marsha only hastens the downward spiral."
1,no warm lotion,"I'm a Massage Therapist and have been looking for a unit to warm, and keep my massage lotion warm for my clients in these chilly winter months.At first I tried the less expensive baby bottle warmers, hoping they would work. After returning 3 of those I figured you get what you pay for and ordered this expensive product assuming my problem was solved.First of all you have to leave the unit plugged in all the time. The company assured me that it is safe but this is something I wish the product description said. Secondly, after leaving the gel/lotion warmer plugged in for about a week my lotion is still as chilly as it was. The unit is a warm to touch and the bottles heat up nicely but it isn't worth the amount of money.I am in the process of returning the unit and I think I'll forget about lotion warmers and try Prossage Heat Lotion."
2,So-so,"I got this to be able to put on warm lotion out of the shower (Midwest winters are cold!!). The bottles weren't that warm, even if I left it running for awhile. Also, I really just needed one bottle but the single model was more expensive. I returned this and there was no hassle at all, so I admire the way they handled it. For home use, just get a sturdy microwave-safe bottle, fill it with fav lotion, microwave for a few seconds and apply :-)"
5,My daughter loves it!,"I bought the cassette version for my now 3 year old daughter. We've been listening to it for a year, and we've finally worn out the tape! I'm getting the CD version today. I highly recommend this CD. My daughter loves Bobby and Marie, and she started to repeat words and phrases almost right away. It was a great introduction to French for my daughter. I also enjoy listening along. So many children's songs and CD's can be supremely irritating after months and months of repeated listening, but this one really isn't. I've learned a couple of things as well!"
2,It is mostly English,"I purchased this CD on the basis of the positive reviews but after hearing it I am really unsure how it got any. I suppose this CD would be fine if you were primarily interested in something to keep the kids' attention on car rides and considered the French words a bonus. My kids did enjoy listening a few times. However, if you are actually hoping your kids will learn the French language, I doubt this will help. Many of the words are spoken with loud background music which obscures pronunciation. Further, instead of the Three Bears story actually being told in French (or fully bilingually), the story is told in English and only nouns or broken phrases are translated. I believe this CD uses a very dated model of language acquisition and the attempt to make it entertaining for kids makes it even poor at that."
4,An incredible testimony,"This book is quite short and easy to read, it tells an amazing story of transformation in a group of orphaned boys who have been touched by God and the visions they saw. I wanted it to be longer, I wanted it to go into more detail, I wanted to know what happened to the boys after? I loved it and will both read it again and share it."
5,Great book,This is required reading for my daughters missions training school in Africa. She loves this book and was thrilled to get it for Christmas.
5,excellent,This product met with my expectations and your service is as always excellent.I have nothing but positive reviews for your service.
5,Visions Beyond The Veil,This was well done and easy reading. An important message on being ready for Heaven through JESUS CHRIST the LORD. Amazon was quick to send it to me.
4,A keeper,"Very good quality printing, paper, cover and plain to read print. You will never forget this book. Documented true stories of children who have visited heaven. They had no idea who God was or even if there was a God. Buy this book."
5,very careful here,"don't read this one if you are having trouble with recurrent nightmares, or phobias, or are inhibited about sexual fantasies, or believe that everyone should just be happy and love each other. this is twisted sick stuff, incredibly powerfully delivered. each nugget of a chapter lasts only as long as is necessary to create a lasting image, or surreal image-association complex. wonderful reading if you are interested in exploring the depths of human consciousness."
4,the best,"At first Gira's similes seem strained but then become utterly captivating. They hit you with force. He has a completely new vision of the urban landscape - he makes us see things in new ways. Its a seamless melding of dream imagery with the everyday. A few of the writings tend to rants but most are well crafted stories, as they say. Even when they don't go anywhere, the message comes through."
4,The Consumer by Michael Gira (Reviewlet),"Obscure juvenilia of Hemingwayan immediacy and intensity reminiscent of the author's musical oeuvre, which is, due to experience, multi-sensory input and the ecstatic spontaneity and infrangible rapport built in his live performance art, far superior to these experiments. Considering the current price of this collection it is very much an item almost exclusively for fans of the aforementioned who may very much enjoy the more personal experience of these works which, to this reviewer, through presentation, are redolent more so of Michael Gira's efforts with Angels of Light than of those with Swans, despite the urgent lyrical congruence; powerful stuff."
1,for those who love gore,"It is difficult to review this book without using the four letter word. Well, be prepared to encounter all kinds of bodily secretions then (yes, all you can think off) with some raping of children, eating of human flesh and the like thrown in as well. All that in a very clear, detailed and rather detached language which would make good reading formally if there was another content. So if you have a very good stomach and love to keep reading about gore through 47 short stories - go ahead, otherwise - beware."
5,"lush,organic,deeply unsettling modern fary tales","The consumer, like most of M gira's work is duplicitly lush, beautifull,serene and yet horrific on a quantum metaphysical level. I found this to be THE most repulsive,disturbing, writing I have ever come across and yet,I found myself drawn into the irresistable deep beaty that evocates out of the pages. The author has a spoken word CD called ""the somniloquist"" wich I also reccomend. It gave me some of the most unusual nightmares I can remember.Gira's unique writing style is hallucinogenic and sedative, yet seething with the power that can be found in his seminal, equally genius band ""SWANS"" and ""the angels of light"" (check them both out) @ swanspair.com Order this book if not simply for the fact that there is NOTHING really similar. even if you dont ""like"" it you will not be uneffected."
3,More Disgusting than Horror,"If you are into raping children, animal cruelty, incest and sexual satisfaction from disgusting imagery, then this is the book for you. I personally don't care for these kinds of things so this book was just not the kind of reading I like. So, I give it a horror factor of 2, a disgust factor of 10 and a way out in left field factor of 100."
2,Not thrilling,"I was very disappointed in this book. Most of the reviews said it was sick and twisted, which I happen to like, but it was boring. Very wordy. Too much like ""literature"" to be sick and twisted."
4,"Cold, clinical, beautiful and horrifying...","The Consumer is not for everyone. I feel that it's a beautiful work and a very pure vision . . . full of horrifying, clinically written and presented ""fairy tales"" of human suffering and misery. This is a book of pain. There are some truly disturbing images in this collection. I was reading works by Peter Sotos (Index) and Irvin Welsh (Filth) during the same period as this one, and it fit in quite nicely. If you don't like to wince or have the wind knocked out of you by words, then don't even pick this up."
5,Original and stylish,"This is one of the most refreshing books I have read in recent months. The writing is very explorative. The imagery is intricate, gruesome, organic, scatalogical. M. Gira imaginatively conveys the darker and seamier side of the psyche in his examinations of self-destruction, delusion, orgiastic excess and loss of identity. Definitively worth noticing."
4,decent base work,"decent compilation of DVDs, varying in length and difficulty. good for late base training (or all base if seasoned competitor)"
3,Panasonic DVD-LS5 Portable DVD Player @ Bytesector.com,"Panasonic has given us their DVD-LS5 portable DVD player to experiment with. This little device allows DVD-RAM, DVD-R, and MP3 playback. It is a great replacement for a portable CD player since it can act as a portable CD player itself; usable with a car kit or a home TV, the LS5 is extremely portable and compact. Today we will explore the features and design aesthetics of this device and show you the ups and downs....more @ Bytesector.com"
5,Excellent,"Top quality picture, sounds is loud but not special cos of tiny speakers. Battery is long lasting, fits in a tiny space and screen movement is great in confined spaces. With a carry case works well hanging in a car."
3,"Fun, But I Can't Tell What Time It Is","This is a nice, fun watch at a good price. The only problem is, I have a real hard time figuring out what time it is. The ""hands"" get lost against the face of the watch. If knowing the time is important to you, skip this one."
3,It's okay....,"but it's cheaper at walmart. So, go there and get your Dead Down Wind. You'll be glad you did! Wish I had!"
5,"half the price of the auto parts store, all of the quality",I bought several of these drums for my mail Jeep. They showed up packed in a cardboard box with appropriate weights welded to them for balance. No issues with fitment or quality. Go for it.
3,Over priced,"This kit is old, however it should be under 40 bucks at most, yet this dude is asking nearly 100 bucks, avoid"
1,"Don't waste your money on this, buy something else!","I decided to replace the male end of a garden hose with this. It seemed to install ok, and looked tight. The first time I applied pressure though, the coupler blew apart. The steel claw ring slid right off the brass part. They aren't even soldered, they're just kind of pressed together. The claw is still attached to the piece of hose I cut off to try a better product.It didn't cost enough to be worth sending back, but it is a waste of time and money to buy and install. Use something else, probably ANYTHING else is better. This didn't give me ten seconds of service. It is a complete piece of crap, and I will avoid Gilmour products in the future."
4,Hot water hose ends only,The hose ends are only for Rubber hoses and hot water hosesIn the desription they did not state this out very wellThey will not work on Garden hoses.The metal pc is too small in diameter
5,great loadout system,"This vest is an overall good product. It is well made and durable. my only compliant is, I wish it had side straps to tighten the harness instead of laces. The laces give a more exact fit to your body but a strap is easier to grab and go. The loadout has loops at the bottom to strap around a waste belt/ pistol belt. It does no come with the belt. Good product and seller, Airsplat is a good company and I love their products.-Cliff"
3,WW III,I was in the Navy for a few years so I find war movies interesting. I specifically came to Amazon.com to find this movie. I could not find it anywhere else. It is a rare and older movie but it has good things in it. I did not pay much attention to the casting of the characters but did like the storyline and plot of the movie and cannot wait to get it in my possession.
1,Bad Bad Bad and Just Plain Horrible For Floyd Fans,"Are you serious, Roger Waters, if I want Pink Floyd I'll buy anything other than this bad DVD. Roger Waters needs to get over the fact that Floyd Is what it is without him. He may have at one time been an integral part of Floyd back in the hey day, but don't try to ressurect something that can't be done without Gilmour, Mason, Wright and Company. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
4,excellent sound,"this dvd sounds great in dd 5.1, but i did not hear any sound coming from center channel speaker. is this the way it is supposed to be? someone please let me know."
4,Roger Waters still rocks,"Excellent soundtrack and picture although I would definetly like to see more impressive works such as PULSE or the Delicate Sound of the ThunderI know that Waters wants to leave the Pink Floyd age behind but those 2 video works made history and deserve to be in DVD formatHowever this DVD is fantastic, a must have"
4,Waters' In The Flesh Live Does Not Disappoint,"I'm a Floyd fan, having seen both Floyd (w/o Waters) and Waters solo. I was a little skeptical about this DVD until I read some positive reviews here, and decided to try it. I am glad I did. The sound is terrific, the video is terrifc, and there are some choice selections, like ""Dogs"" off Animals. Roger seems at ease as a frontman, and the assembled musicians are good. If there is a downside, it's the limited number of solo Waters tunes, but if you are primarily interested in the Floyd tracks, you'll enjoy this."
4,4 out of 5,I am a little disappointed with the video and sound sync. the sound is about a half second ahead of the video but the show is so good I would still recommend it!
3,Good show but boring in parts,"I found this show to be boring in parts. I find stuff like ""in the flesh"", ""money"", ""shine on..."", ""comfortably numb"" , etc, to be rather overplayed by Pink Floyd and Roger and it would be good to hear totally different tracks never before attempted live. I also think there are songs that Roger should stay away from such as ""Wish you were here"", ""Time"", ""Shine on.."" etc, because he just cant sing them properly, they were sung by Gilmour originally. He does have particular band members singing tracks such as ""Money"", ""Dogs"" etc, but why go down that road, it may as well be a PF cover band in that case. Having said all that, he made a good job of ""Southhampton dock"" and some of his solo stuff but it would have been such a treat to hear a few more tracks from The final cut and more from his solo stuff."
5,Must-Have one,"This is another Must-Have dvd to be one of the Floydians and a fan of Roger Waters. Otherwise, don't count yourself as one. Roger Waters and the band have created an amazing performance with wonderful audience. The sound and the picture quality is splendid. If you love PINK FLOYD and ROGER WATERS,and a ROCK-MUSIC lover, this s an INDISPENSIBLE concert dvd to be watched over and over again. You can't realize how fast time passes with Jacky on the rocks beside you. STANLEY KUBRICK's contribution to 'Perfect Sense' has made the song awesome. Hall's begging mercy to Dave on the background sound has put the put the bricks on the wall finally. 'What God Wants' could've added more flavors in the concert. I'm sure we all Roger Lovers will meet in the Garden one day. Fly high..."
5,Awesome,I was blown away by the clarity of the picture and the setlist. This is a must for any Floyd and Roger Waters fan. This was my first concert DVD purchase and I couldn't be more please with the whole production.
5,Pleasantly suprised,"I have been a big fan of Pink Floyd for years. But when Roger Waters brought out his solo projects, they just did not impress me much, therefore I placed his work in the back of my mind.What a mistake. This DVD looks and sound incredible. Not a flashy stage show like Pink Floyd, but Roger Waters are skilled musicians and it looks like they are having fun.I will also be using this DVD to show off my home theater. It's that good."
4,"amazingly genuine, but...","Well... This DVD shows a really amazing content. Roger Waters on stage, after years and years and years... ""In the flesh"" is, for me, the most impressive part. It reminds me of ""old"" Pink Floyd times. In musical terms, the DVD is absolutely perfect and well done. However, Waters has, with age, lost lots of his cynic behaviour, which I find is a pity. ""Another brick in the wall"" is sung with enthusiasm - but all the despair of the ""original"" wall is lost - just the elements which made this masterwork so unbeatable. Well... we all become older, and, to be fair, I leave 4 stars behind. The show is modest but effective."
5,In The Flesh DVD Best Value For Money,"I have been to the Roger Waters concert at the Bellville Velodrome in South Africa. My opinion still is that Roger Waters WAS Pink Floyd. All the Floyd classics that HE WROTE, come to their real value in this concert. The DVD captures so much emotion and musical excellence - it is unbelievable to think that I experienced exactly the same atmosphere as on the DVD. The quality of the concert is also of highest quality. According to internet sources The Wall Live In Berlin DVD will be released in April 2003. That is another great release to look forward to. Get this DVD! Pink Floyd will never be the same without Roger Waters!"
2,pomp and no circumstance.,"I wonder if it's ever occurred to Roger Waters that for all of his carping about how the concert milieu has diminished the performer's ability to communicate directly with the audience, he plays right into that stereotype of ""big, bigger, biggest"" and has since THE WALL. What is so freaking ""direct"" about all of this stage puffery on display in this video? What, Rog, too scared to find out that if you stripped all of it away, people would find out you had nothing to say?On it's own terms, IN THE FLESH LIVE makes for a decent enough rock concert spectacle, but, please Roger, spare me the sanctimonious garbonzo about audiences being ""amused to death."" Want to communicate directly? How about showing up with just a guitar and see what happens? Until that time, welcome to the machine!"
1,Where has the Pink Floyd sound gone ?,"I'm a all time Pink Floyd fan. I own a dozen of their albums and I was at the unforgettable 1978 concert in Paris.I was so excited to buy this DVD after all the great ratings I read about it.Sure it's a nice selection of titles, the image is good and the sound quality is technically superb! But that's all. :(Where has the Pink Floyd sound gone ? Where is the magic? Where is the emotion? The arrangement is terrible. Take ""Shine On Your Crazy Diamond"" for example. The voice misses completely the desperation it has on the Wish You Were Here album, the 3 background choir girls are good looking for sure and probably talented, but gosh, they have nothing to do here, it's a sabotage.How dare you play PINK FLOYD like SOUL music ? Appaling. I could not stand it and switched to the ""real"" albums.If your are a real Pink Floyd fan, you'd better listen to it before spending your money in this mascarade. The Pink Floyd touch is definitely not here."
2,A Very Good Lesson For Any Musician...Terrible DVD...,"This is a very sad DVD, because Roger Waters was once a musical genious and his downfall does not make any less of his previous accomplishments. The only reason i gave this DVD a 2 instead of a 1 is because its worth seeing to learn a very valuable lesson, but the actual performance is sickeningly aweful. Roger Waters has really lost his mind, he considers himself to be some kind of untouchable GOD in this DVD, he is more of a Las Vegas Seigfried & Roy theatrical performance, than a musician, just like every other gutless pop hit in todays music industry. If you cant pick this up from the intro and the performance itself (i love his hair flick ever time he hits an important note, lol) then check out the behind the scenes feature, which is more of an ""undercover with a corrupted musician"" and you will see what i mean. Its actually rather sad and disgusting, but a very valuable lesson for any quality musician."
5,"Great Collection Of Floyd, Old And New","Granted, this is not Pink Floyd, but Roger Waters assembled a great group of supporting musicians for this tour. Doyle Bramhall II looks a little out of his element, but he handles some faithful renditions of legendary David Gilmour solos. A definite must for any Floyd fan."
5,IN THE FLESH,"I recently bought this dvd on a whim. I was pleasantly suprised.The live show while lacking some of the early Floyd youthfulness,shows a well tuned and almost spunky Roger in full glory. The sound is wonderful. The camara angles just right. It truly made we wish I was there. If you are a Floyd or Roger fan don't hessitate. Wish there were a few more tunes from his solo work though."
3,It's good but something is missing,"I bought the CD because a very good friend said that if I was such a big PF fan I should see Roger Live to get the whole picture, then I got the DVD as a Gift, and very recently I went to the live show in Mexico City. The DVD is very good, the songs of course are well known by every PF fan (some people have told me that they haven't heard before the post PF era of Waters). It was good watching old Roger singing and playing songs from his PF era, specially since he was the creative force of most songs.The problem was that something was missing, it was really funny, specially in the concert, it was a very good show, but the songs sounded funny,like something was missing (PF was what was missing)for example snowy white did his best(he is a very good guitar player) but he is no David Gilmoure. What I'm trying to get at is that the present PF sound more like the ""complete"" PF that Roger Waters alone.I'm sory Roger but as much as PF needs you, you need more of them."
5,God bless Roger!,"I saw the first 2 shows of the tour (Milwaukee and Chicago). The performance was great, the band was amazing and Roger was...well...he was Roger...in all his glory. Don't miss this DVD!"
3,"Very good band, but don't expect the Pink Floyd sound......","As good as the musicians in this band are, it's much like watching a Pink Floyd tribute band. They can play all the right notes, but they will never sound like Pink Floyd.The truth remains that the contribution Waters made to pink floyd was with lyrics, not sound. With the exception of Final Cut, it is Gilmours vocals that remain the signature sound of Floyd, and it was Gilmour and Wrights musicianship that defined Floyd.This was a great concert, despite Waters looking disinterested at times, but no matter how talented the musicians here are, the Pink Floyd sound I grew to love is simply lacking.If you want to hear a good cover band play Pink Floyd songs, get this DVD. The sound quality is great.If you want to hear Pink Floyd play Pink Floyd songs post-1985, buy the Pulse DVD. (Or better yet, get the laserdisc version if you have the player and can find it!)"
3,"Dolby Digital maybe, 5.1 Surround Sound...NO WAY","Don't get me wrong..this is a great concert, great repertoire. However, I have to say that although the option for 5.1 surround sound appears on the menu, what you get is only sound from the two front speakers and the subwoofer. No sound comes from the central speaker and surround sound speakers.One past review mentioned this...he is right. I would have loved for this music to come on real 5.1 surround sound but it still sounds good though...2.1 surround sound maybe....that's why I give it only 3 stars."
5,The Best Ever,"I was at one of the concerts they filmed for this DVD, and I have to say being there was AMAZING, and this DVD comes pretty close to what I experienced. I love watching this and remembering seeing him live at this show. He was in top form, much better than his more recent dark side tour. If you like Pink Floyd, please do yourself a favor and buy this, you will not be disappointed."
5,"Oh by the way,which one's pink?","I've been waiting a long time for a dvd release of ""Pulse"". Well, this will definitely hold me over until then. In fact, I'm not sure which one is closer to a ""Floyd experience"".Just a great performance with awewsome production values."
5,Excellent show and DVD!,Saw the show in Johannesburg on 1 March 2002 - the best in South Africa ever! Buy this DVD today!
5,Waters band better than Gilmour's Floyd,"While i think the music in the Pulse video is very good and the lighting show good too, i always thought the Pulse video showed that you need a cozier venue than the Earls court venue. The band seemed elevated too high and the fans so far away that they never really seemed that they were much into the concert. Waters in the Flesh dvd taped in Oregon is much closer to the fans. All of Waters band mates (Jon Carin appears in both) are excellent musicians and every bit as good as the Gilmour PF. All that's really needed is for Gilmour to show up at one of Waters concerts and play lead guitar and you would have the best PF shows ever. White and Bramhall make for a excellent lead guitar duo and it doesnt hurt that 2 of the female singers are good looking. It was also good to hear a couple songs from the ""Animals"" cd as the Gilmour PF is apparently not allowed to perform those Waters tunes. All in all i would rather see the Waters PF versus the Gilmour PF."
5,LOVE IT! The most popular DVD in our house.,"I should probably start with the statement that both my husband and I are huge Pink Floyd fans. The fact is it was one of the big reasons we went out in the first place, and our first date was to a Pink Floyd light show at a planetarium. However we love their older stuff, when Waters was still with the group. I came across this DVD a few years ago and decided to buy it. It turned out to be the best DVD I have ever bought. We have since purchased a dozen copies and have a few at home, and gave the rest to a bunch of friends and family members.We recently watched ""The Wall: Live in Berlin, 1990"", which was also performed by Roger Waters and his new band and think that ""Roger Waters - In the Flesh"" is a superior DVD. It has a great selection of songs (from several albums, plus some new stuff) and the quality of sound is excellent. Even our dog likes to sing to large number of songs from this DVD.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
4,Parchment Worshippers Take Note,"The Constitution that we live under was originally intended to be a document that would provide the cracks from which the waters of tyranny would ooze. The Hamiltonian Centralizers purposely provided us with a document that would destroy true Federalism (decentralization) and exalt the notion of a highly centralized form of Republican tyranny. The ""Anti-Federalists"" were the TRUE Federalists, and the ""Federalists"" were actually anti-federalists when the meaning of such is taken in its proper context.Boston T. Party deflates the wet dreams of the Parchment Worshippers. The Constitution actually went through numerous re-writings so as to pave the way for later interpretations that would grant ultimate power to a Central Machine. The Articles of Confederation should have been left to stand."
4,Different Point of View,"This book looks at relationships and sexual intimacy in terms of power and power relationships. Most of the follow up was somewhat technical and mechanical, and less helpful than understanding brain chemistry reactions would have been. However, the early chapter allusions (almost a priori in their nature) to the basis of relationships was useful however elliptical since I have not previously understood that sexual relationships function in that manner for some people."
1,not a good book,I only bought this book because it was a dollar or two. If I had seen it in a bookstore instead of online I wouldn't even have spent a dollar or two. Not a very modern sex book. Wouldn't recommend it at any price.
5,I laughed until I wet my pants,"I had zero expectations when I saw this thing but my girlfriend dragged me to it because her roommate acted in it and we both thought it was hilarious. There's about ten plots going on throughout which you have to be paying attention to if you want to really enjoy it so make sure you're sober when you see it. Her roommate was one of the few girls who stay fully clothed the whole move so be warned if you're watching this with your grandmother. (Unless your grandomother is a stripper) I don't know why it's not going to the theaters, it's much better than most of the crap I see that makes a fortune. Plus Vida Gerra is in it and the guy from Office Space who tries to kill himself."
3,Dorm Daze,The movie is great. Its funny and Vida Guerra is awesome. However this copy does not have the photo shoot of Vida Guerra. Very disapointing because she is very hot. I asked for a refund and Amazon granted it.
2,national lampoon's,"steady decline of quality continues...this movie was nor very funny nor entertainingnational lampoon's doesn't come through again....i'd pass on this but compared to the 1st one, i would say number two is actually the better"
3,"Churchill China Brook Blue 45-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 8","It was a great piece, but one of the pieces were chipped. Then I would be paying more money (shipping and purchase cost) to get a new plate b/c they don't sell anything in the package seperatley at Amazon. In the stores the price for that once piece is expensive, so all I could so was keep the chipped china piece. That did not leave me happy at all. I prefer not to order China from Amazon."
4,Very Nice,"This set is very nice, but the color is not evenly bright, some plates are a lot lighter then others."
5,Your Will,I LOVED THE SERVICE THE CD WAS WELL WORTH THE NEXT DAY XPRESS FEE I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME I HAVE OTHERS WANTING 2 ADD THE CD 2 THEIR COLLECTION I BURNED 2 COPIES 1 FOR MY CAR AND THE OTHER 2 LISTEN 2 AT WORK
4,Solid!,"Well i didn't hear of brooks until i listened to my old parents Hezekiah Walker CD, Focus on Glory, and Brooks did some duets with the choir. So i checked him up. Gotta say He does it good :P"
4,Very good CD,"I really enjoyed this artist.I took a Gamble because I was unfamiliar with his music,but I was not dissapointed.I love Gospel music and this cd delivers.I even got one as a gift for my brother.Worth every penny!"
3,A Six-Legged Spider?,"The only comment I wish to make is the fact that spiders have eight legs, not the six portrayed in this book. I know this is picky, but shouldn't children's books be instructive at every opportunity?"
5,Very good Bible for the price,"From what I have read so far, the HCSB seems to be a good translation. I would recommend it for someone looking for the accuracy of the NASB, but readability of the NIV.This particular book is basically a paperback Bible with an imitation leather cover. The pages are made of the same paper as paperback books. This is the only paperback Bible I've ever seen with red-lettering. Just like other paperback Bibles, there is no book marker.This would be a great Bible for a new Christian, for a confirmation or Sunday School gift, for a ""first"" Bible, for handing out to evangelize, or to just check out the HCSB translation (like what I'm doing with it). It isn't as nice as more expensive Bibles, however, considering that it only costs $5, it is a very nice Bible for the money."
5,Definitely worth checking out!,"First, it goes without saying this is an excellent value. It provides a great opportunity to check out this new translation.The HCSB is one of only two new translations that I like (the other being the ESV). The only thing I don't like is its tendency to be a little too conversational at times.On the other hand, the translators seem to place a high priority on accuracy (my one problem with the NIV, at times).Bottom line: get a copy of the ESV and a copy of the HCSB and you'll have two great alternatives to the NIV (for those times when you want a change of pace)."
4,Really Lovely For The Right Spot,"We ordered these to go on the mantel in a friendss house were we were getting married. Obviously, it was important to us that everything looked great and since we were doing our vows right in front of the fireplace, what went on the mantel was important. These had the look we wanted and the fit the larger mantel well. We had one on either end which looked great especially with the rise in the candle levels.When it arrived some of the decorative elements and the candle holders themselves were a bit bent or tilted but we put them right and there were no problems. Nothing felt like it would break off from adjusting the metal. The finish was good, not spotty or thin. Use short, wide candles not pillars."
3,Hessians,"The Hessian is an interesting story about the American Revolution, centering on the prejudices and uncertainties of one town. When a group of Hessians (German mercenaries who were hired by the English in the Revolutionary war) kill one of their townspeople, Abraham Hunt, the town's leader, plans an ambush, then puts the only surviving Hessian, the drummer boy, on trial for murder."
4,Very Good,I liked it better than most of the books we reading english. I thought it was very thought provoking.
4,Another good read by Anne Stuart,"Anne Stuart seems to be fond of a love story that starts out with a very young heroine falling in love with an older hero and then having circumstances tear them apart for years before reuniting (Ice Storm is another one of hers, which I also enjoyed very much).Interesting story amidst war torn Central America, good writing, and good chemistry between the characters. I did feel that Maddy was very fickle with her emotions and decisions, she'd think one thing one moment but then does something else entirely the next, the inconsistency of her character was a detraction for me. Otherwise, a good read though, I read this in one day and held my attention from the start."
5,muscular harmonica,This album is the cream of Charlie's Alagator work.The cat can sure burn up a harp.
3,They'll do,"I bought these as an incentive in the ""potty training"" process, as my son loves Spongebob. The tags are VERY scratchy (thanks to whomever suggested the seam ripper - it's been a life saver!) and the quality isn't great, but hey, kids outgrow everything in a matter of months anyway, so it's not really a problem. He definitely wants to wear them, they're cute, and the customer service/shipping was great. I'll probably get a different brand as he gets bigger and the options expand, but these will do for now."
2,Kinda disappointed,"These under-ware are cute, but they have tags in them that are uncomfortable and make my son itch. I tried cutting the tags out but the area where the tags were is still rough, and as my son says; ""gives him a itchy butt."""
3,Pretty good but you have to like Shat,This is for people who love Shatner. It's reality television so you've seen all these types of tricks and people before but it is fun to watch him preen and poke fun at himself. Sometimes people call him Kirk by mistake
4,I'm from Iowa,This DVD is the TV version in that every 45 minutes you have a recap of the previous 45 minutes; they just cut out the TV ads.Would have been better if it was the movie version like they had on the sci-fi channel.5 people watched this tape and all 5 were really interested and pleased with it.
1,Disappointing,Not what I expected- more of a documentary of tricking the town than showing making a movie & then showing the blow off that it was fake. Still viewing the last disc. Creative tricks pulled on the towns folk.No subtitles- hard to hear. Subtitles would have made it easier to follow.
4,Techniques,This is a great book for those who have some experiance in photoshop & want to sharpen your skills. I picked up on some stuff I haden't gotten from school when I got my BA at art school. A must have for Photoshopers.
1,Missing Images,"I like to go through a book and follow the techniques exactly. Then I go back and try with my own photos. Only problem here is that not all the photo's in the book are available for download. This is the main reason I give this book 1 star. I tried to search the internet for similar images just like the ones in the book, but got frustrated after a couple of hours. Now my book just sits on the shelf. I tried emailing the publisher and the website where the images are at. No one has replied to me."
2,No disk,"Generally a good to very-good book, but let down by the fact the author makes continuous references to the images in the book as he edits them, but the book does not come with a CD of the images, nor are they available for download.With the small size and poor print quality of the images in the book, it is sometimes difficult to see what is happening, whereas if the images were supplied you would be able to ""follow-along"".So, while a good book, one you'll be disappointed with so I cannot in all honesty recommend it to you."
2,Interesting techniques but instructions lacking,There are a number of interesting techniques that you can try here but I found the instructions to be lacking. You would get through some of the steps only to find that the book doesn't explain how to do certain adjustments. Could be a bit more descriptive. I found this disappointing.
1,2nd Edition! - What did you update Barry?,I went through both the 1st and 2nd editions and all of the text is the same and the example photos are all the same (some of the screen shots and pictures print better and some worse in the 2nd edition). The only differences are in the appenidix dealing with shortcuts!I think the author (and publisher) have done a grave disservice to their customers by claiming this is an update!What will you do for the Photoshop CS3 update?
3,"Not a Bad Book, but...","This is not a bad book, but the downloaded images are of very low quality. It is difficult to see the before-and-after effect with such as low quality images.I like the section on Creating Reflection and Converting Overcast Days and Sunny Days, but the chapters on Light Sources and Using the Lighting Effect Filter is not very completed. You might be disappointed if you were a photographer like myself looking for a book on improving outdoor/studio lighting on the photos. The book caters more to a digital artist who like to create rather dramatic lighting effects. The techniques such as adding fire, thunderbolt, refraction, and neon colors might make photos look ""fake"" to photographers who are interested in making a more subtle lighting improvement to their photos.All in all, it is a pretty good book for someone who is interested in learning special lighting effect. I will not hesistate to give the book a better rating if the downloaded images are of higher quality."
2,Save your money and learn to light...,"Looking at the images in this book is akin to watching a bad magician at work: the secret ""moves"" are anything but. Some of the effects like fire and smoke are obviously fake. Others, like casting shadows from blinds and plants are less so, but still ""feel"" wrong in the way the shadows often have the wrong density and falloff, or fail to follow the curves and shapes of foreground objects.If you're serious about your photography, I'd advise getting a good book on lighting by someone like Barrister, and learn to light for real. Many of the ""effects"" presented in the book can be done in seconds with some rudimentary equipment and a little practice.... or you can spend hours in PS ""perfecting"" an image that, like the magician's tricks, fools no one but himself."
3,Lack of Support is frustrating,"Like many reviewers I find the lack of website support and the absence of a CD with a good resolution of photos to practice on absolutely frustrating. With basic knowledge of photoshop navigation, I was able to follow the tutorials and make a couple of lighting effects on my own pictures. So that is a plus. I wrote an email asking for better resolution pictures from the book to be posted on the web site, and I got no answer. I wrote one more time, and there was no answer to my second email either. We customers, must start demanding a CD, or a better resolution photos that are downloadable from the website."
4,Great Book But No Source Files!,"I love this book, both for its content and its presentation. The tutorials are explained clearly and step by step. There is not a lot of technical jargon to confuse you therefore this being one of the easiest Photoshop books to grasp.The only thing that brings this down a star is that there is no source files included. Generally, either a CD or a website is provided with the source images, but here, that is not the case. So, instead of getting right to work, first you need to track down your own images that will hopefully come pretty close in recreating the lesson. I can't believe not including the files was even an idea in somebody's head when they dreamed up this book. It wouldn't even cost anything to just throw them up on a web site."
2,Cheesy lighting effects,"I was really hoping this book would be good. Unfortunately the lighing effects in the book are down right cheesy looking. Fake neon, etc. If you are looking for obvious fake looking lighting effects, then you might like this book. I'm a photographer and was hoping to get some insight on how I can convincingly apply lighing effects to my own pictures of people and places taken in natural lighting. Definately check it out at the bookstore before you buy."
4,All in a nut shell,"compact information, great for planning a short visit to DC., especialy for people with limited time for preparations."
5,Superb compilation!,"This seems to be the same material recently shown on PBS. Anyone who recalls coming home after school and watching The Mike Douglas Show because there was only one TV in the house and that's what Mom had on will thoroughly enjoy this trip down memory lane. And there won't be a dry eye for ""The Men in My Little Girl's Life.""Plus, the price is fantastic!"
4,brought back good memories,"I had seen some of this on PBS fundraiser and it brought back memories of coming home from school and watching this with my mother most every day. When I received it I sat down and watched with my own daughter. We enjoyed it so much we watched it twice. My only complaint is that it's too short, an hour was not enough. 20 years of shows, it should've been at least 2 hours. It's a DVD that will definitely get passed around the family"
3,Good book but too long.,Good information though written in a wordy style that I disliked. Could have been shorter and had better headings to bring out the structure and information.
4,Very cool.,I bought these to go along with the discover sounds kitchen i bought for my 15 month old daughter.she ended up liking the Accessories more than the kitchen!
4,A cheap distraction,"You probably already know this song. It was a Top Ten hit for INXS in 1990. This CD features five remixes of the song, none of which are radically different than the version we are all familiar with. Plus, you get the ""b-side"" of the single, which is ""Everybody Wants U Tonight"". This is barely even a song, with the only lyrics being ""Everybody wants you tonight"" repeated over and over. Here is the track listing:1. Suicide Blonde (7"" Mix)2. Suicide Blonde (Earth Mix)3. Suicide Blonde (Devastation Mix)4. Suicide Blonde (Milk Mix)5. Suicide Blonde (Demolition Mix)6. Everybody Wants U Tonight (Unavailable on LP)"
3,most exciting!,"I was kept in suspence throughout the entire movie...behind every door there is a new and even more frightening surprise, than the last one. It holds your attention...you dont want to blink while watching this one, you may miss something good. very little nudity(dream sequence), but plenty of horrific death scenes, plus heeps & heeps of gore. credible acting from the cast. a must see B Movie !!! it takes ""GUTS"" to watch this one.careful, don't fall asleep. ohh, and the girls arent too shabby, either."
2,A Bogus Crop,"Harvesters had a chance from the start to be a pretty good film,but it flopped. Maybe because of direction, maybe because of differences of ideas, whatever.One thing that messed up this film was the silly CGI/visual effects. Watch for them with the guy driving his car by the screen and the other one when they are driving down the dirt road to the ""Harvester"" house.The movie did have some good scenes and the acting was okrent it first see what you think,I own it and i'm not impressedwith it."
4,"A very good grade ""Z"" movie","This had a very low budget, but the story line is just twisted enough to be interesting. Not sure why the leader of the criminal gang was a lesbian Gulf War vet, but okay. Two of the absolute dumbest marshalls ever, too. Still, more than enough twists and turns of plot and the acting is just good enough to be decent. As a bonus, Jaime Kalman is absolutely gorgeous as the ""beauty queen"". Guys can watch it for her, if nothing else. I do recommend this movie, though. Not worth 5 stars, but definitely worth 4."
4,"Great, fun B movie","As a fan of the american B movie genre, I was most pleased to come across this one! Lots of blood and gore, lots of imagination, the special effects were fabulous!!Great cast, the lead actress playing Frankie has an intriguing and haunting 1940's style quality that made the movie even better......she is not what you usually see in the B movies........nice to see a beautiful woman with strength and assurance in a lead role in a horror film!!Great film for a bucket of poporn on a cold winter's night!!"
3,Great Tunes,"If you want to watch someone play lots of basic fiddle tunes and need fiddling tips, get this DVD. BUT, if you can't read even simple music, look for something else. This DVD uses ""tablature"" in place of real music notation.The instructor plays many simple folk tunes with progressive complexity and no ""showing off"". I'll keep this DVD and study it alot, but I'll have to convert the tablature booklet into real music when I have time."
1,It was OK,"This book was helpful in learning how to hold the fiddle, but then it expects that you know how to use the bow already and doesn't give much time in between verbal instructions to allow practice on that item - so you have to keep pausing the dvd. If your holding a fiddle and bow, pausing the dvd every 30 seconds is not an easy task."
3,Not as good as the kitchen,"We have the Discover Sounds Kitchen (which is great) so I decided to try this toy. It is not nearly as interesting as the kitchen but the girls do enjoy the ball drop and the nails. I think it's a decent toy for the price, but I wish it had more interesting parts to it."
2,Not thrilled with this workbench,"My son received this toy for Christmas last year when he was 9 months old. He is now 18 months old and still doesn't play with it. It just doesn't hold his interest. ON the other hand, he could play all; day with the plain old Little Tikes workbench. This is definitely not worth the money - there are more entertaining work bench toys out there."
2,Not Satisfied,"I spent $40 plus shipping and handling for this toy and wasn't impressed with the toy at all. I thought the lights on the toy were extremely dim even after I put new batteries in the toy. It just wasn't what I thought I was getting and I really hate that I spent that much money on a toy that, for lack of a better word, sucks!"
2,Watch Those Tiny Arms!,My 15 month old son received this on Christmas when he was 12 months old. He plays with it some and mainly likes to put the balls in and watch them fall through. He keeps getting his arm and hand stuck in the orange container that holds the balls! He starts screaming because he can't get his arm out and I have to help him pry it out of the container. It hasn't drawn any blood yet but I have to watch him when he is playing with it.
2,What a waste of money,"Santa bought this toy for my son when he was still young. I thought that maybe he would play with it more as he aged. After 8 months he still is uninterested in it. He will crawl right by it and go to a toy more entertaining. I thought that it was going to be a fun toy and that something more would of happened when the ball dropped in the little hole but instead it just fell from point A to point B. BORING! I have to give this toy two thumbs down....hopefully ""Santa"" will research the toys more before he brings them to the good boys for xmas."
5,My son's First Toy and he STILL loves it!,"This was the first real toy we bought my son (other than real baby toys), he was 6 months at the time. From the moment we brought it home, he LOVED it! It comes with three balls that you drop in a slot and they come rolling out - he never got into that part even to this day but he loved and loves hitting the different parts of the workbench with the hammer and hearing the sounds and seeing the lights flash. It also has a winding crank and some other great little features that kids love. Now he is 20 months and although it's no longer one of the main toys he plays with I do see him go over and give it a whirl here and there and I still see the same excitment in his eyes just like the first time. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get rid of this toy not because my son is so attached but because I am attached to the memories of his very first toy and would hate to see it go!"
4,Lasts a loooong time!,"Just wanted to write a quick review. We have the older version - we purchased it for our daughter when she was 9months and that was in 2001!! And at 4 she was STILL playing with it! It has always been a favorite of hers. Sometimes we have put it away because I thought she wasn't interested in it anymore, but when she discovers it or it comes back out, she won't stop playing with it."
3,Nothing Special,"My son (12 months) is very interested in his father's tools, so we thought that this would be a great toy for him. Sadly, it's kind of a glorified, upright exersaucer. It seems well made, and the tunes it plays are not annoying, but other than dropping the ball through the slot (and we have other ""ball toys"") and pushing or pulling the other three attachments (and we have LOTS of toys like that!) there's not much else to do. The hammer is too big and chunky, not enough like a ""real hammer."" In short, it's fine if you don't already have lots off bright plastic in your house, or if your child is young enough to still just want to spin and push without much effect. Otherwise, skip it!"
5,My Son loves this toy !!,My son got this for Christmas when he was 6months. He still plays with it and is 1 year. He loves to bang the hammer and drop the balls in the hole.It is a good first work bench.
5,The Mission Bell rings true,I have been a long time Delirious fan and I would have to say that this album is among their absolute best. They flow so easily from big rocking numbers like 'Paint the Town Red' to slower ballads that still pack a punch. A definite highlight of the album would have to be 'Now Is The Time' a song of encouragement and call to action that sums up nicely the overall theme of the album. I highly reccommend it.
4,Delirious? The Misson Bell,If you like David Crowder you will like Delirious?. They are an Awesome Worship/Techno band. This is the CD to get anybody who's anybody has it.Go out and buy it!
5,GREAT CD!!,"This CD is great! I highly recommend it! Greatly written lyrics, and uplifiting and encouraging music, all with a great message."
3,another great album,"The Mission Bell was much anticipated because it was another release from the British Christian artists, Delirious?. Personally, their previous album World Service became my favorite from all the rest due to the variety and heartfelt praise. I much anticipated the new songs to be heard from The Mission Bell. I must say that Delirious? has done it again: Martin Smith's unique, attention-grabbing voice delivers the message of standing in awe of God and worshiping Him through new styles of music. Although the Mission Bell is quite different from World Service, it contains new tastes and blends in the music with yet some more awesome lyrics. I really like ""Fires Burn."""
2,this game was off the cheesy charyts,i love games that have to do with little people playing with balls espeacially big grapefroot size balls. That is exactly what they do in this game. the balls come alive and eat people then spit out there jucise with there two front teeth
2,Not Hard to find oldies,"It looks like the producer of this series just selects what's made available to him by the record companies and releases it hoping it will sell. Almost every cut has been available for several years on other compilations. All the songs are great, but at least one or two ""hard to find"" selections should have been added. As a collector, if you don't have these selections it's a great CD to have."
3,Not as good as the others,"Everytime it's probably more difficult to come up with follow-ups inlong series and still try be a 5 star CD. This Eric series has beenfirst class all over but this latest edition (Vol. 10) does not hold""rare"" or hard to get songs. Most of these can be found on ACE'swonderful TEENAGE CRUSH series. There are only a few highlights likeJerry Wallace (Ther She Goes) and Barry Young (One Has My Name...)but the rest has been released before on other 50's & 60's compilations."
1,Tedious,"The grainy black-and-white film has a sort of charming nostalgia value.There's some great music (but isn't film essentially a visual medium!?)There are some wry jokes.But NONE of this can excuse or compensate for the lack of ideas or the long, long, looong stretches of tedium between the very occasional shining monment."
1,JUST PLAIN BAAAAD!!!,"Sorry folks-I love low budget, off the wall, extreme camp, all the cult films, etc but this one just doesn't cut it in ANY genre. A lot of it is the same footage played over and over, same with the music. The sound quality is HORRIBLE, not to mention that a lot of the sound was recorded seperately and doesn't even match up to the moving mouths of the (dare I say?) actors. I think Bruce La Bruce might have been shooting at an ""artsy-fartsy, foreign"" type feel with this film, along with the B & W thing, but fell WAY short. The skinhead stays mute for about the first half, where he basically takes a very stupid & LONG bath, then dances around badly in only his boots, flailing his arms around like a chicken with it's head cut off. Purely stupid film. I rented it, so I FORCED myself to finish watching it, hoping something, ANYTHING would develop. The thing ended as stupidly as possible and made no sense whatsoever. Do yourself a favor and rent something else."
3,Tamron non AF,"Great lens for the price, but one thing. i was under the assumption it would be auto focus, but does not contain the essential Af motor needed. If your camera has the AF motor inside then you'll be fine."
4,STANLEY SPENCER'S ENGLISH VISION,"This is the best book on Spencer and his work I have seen so far. There is lots of biographical information and pics of SS, and the paintings are reproduced full page rather than spread over a couple of pages, which to me always ruins the pic. Spencer did some nice stuff, though often somewhat bizarre, but if you are interested in him and his work, this is a wonderful way to begin studying it."
3,"Attractive Cover, succinct and not too racey.","I found this to be an interesting expose on a not very well known son of Queen II. Ms. Leigh discusses Edward as seen by his co-workers and business acquaintences. I wish there had been more pictures of Sophie and Edward together. Edward comes off as a man trying to make his way in the non-royal ""real"" business world. He is accused of nothing more terrible than taking advantage of his royal connections. I assumed all business people did just that. I never really gave him much thought before his engagement but I like him more than I thought I would. He and his wife and best friend Sophie have a viable plan to make their own way for themselves and future family. What is so terrible about that?Donna A. Maier"
4,In Your Face and In Your Best Interests,"This book is a perfect complement to Anne Branscomb's, and provides a well-told tale, researched in partnership with a private investigator, of just what can be gotten on you through the electronic web within which we all live our lives. This book is the tactical gutter in your face version, Branscomb's book is the academic dissection."
2,lets list the flaws too,this product does what the others report but... I've only had it 2 weeks and found out that it will REFUSE to record some shows because the software has some way of knowing that the transmitter wants copyright protection. (this was sports of free tv) So consider paying $400 to make a pc into a vcr that refuses to record some shows. 2nd the drivers & software arent being kept up to date. 3rd there are problems with agp drivers on many motherboards. 4th Allot of what you would think that the software would do it does not. for instance i have been unable to tell it to record the same show in the same time slot every week or day like you can a $50 vcr. so it feels like 1st generation hardware & software to me. also if you have a taste for normal tv resolution on replay better add a 100 gig drive to your expected costs.
3,Did not work with my Epox board,"I Have a Epox EP-8RDA+ and it wont even start the computer with this card in the agp slot with the power going from the power supply. I call ati they said the EP-8RDA+ is not finding that the card is geting power right from the power supply and he said this is a big thing in Hp,Gateways,Dells. He all so said that Epox can make a bios update to fix this. The man said there been about 10 calls about this so Ati will start to look into this with the Aiw 9800pro. I took this card over to my freinds house and it worked great with his Asus Nf2 board."
1,Waste of time and money,"This card is junk. I made the mistake of buying it instead of buying a regular video card and a tv capture card. The reason this card is junk is because it only supports software encoding when capturing media (television programs) and software decoding when playing that media back.My recommendation is to avoid ATI altogether. I say that for a few reasons. First the card arrived with a DVI to VGA adapter. The screws on the adapter don't reach the card, so I just have it kind of pushed on unsecure. I wrote ATI about it and they just sent out a generic message regarding software drivers! Next I got a cryptic error all of the sudden.(...)I have done the research and wasted the time, so I wanted to share my experience and make sure ATI doesn't screw over another consumer."
1,TOTAL WASTE!!,"I wish I would had opened these when I got them, but I had nowhere to put them at the time. So, I lost out. They are a knock off of some sort...says they are made in Columbia and what gets me more upset than anything is that AMAZON has sold them and for the past 6-7 years I have bought many items from Amazon.com and NEVER had an issue with anything. I really wish there was a way for all of us to get our money back since it has been lost to expecting we were getting a great deal on this dish set. Now, I am trying to sell them on eBay and hoping someone doesn't care where they were made and that they are just a pretty set that they can enjoy."
3,Just a Note,"Just so people know, the Churchill China company moved production from England to Columbia for the majority of Finlandia pieces, including the sets. The English-made ones are now only available from individual sellers. :("
5,Churchhill Dishes,I was so happy with this set of dishes. So I ordered another set plus the serving dishes. I am quite pleased.
1,Defective Box Set 2 times,"I like the set, however Amazon keeps shipping defective sets. You can easily see the defects. The actual discs look like they have a bad case of acne. Its always the same 2 that are unplayable. Wait until Amazon gets some that work!"
1,Indiscreet DVD in Cary Grant set is defective!,No reflection on my screen idol (or Amazon) but both sets I received include a defective Indiscreet DVD! There are visible pock marks on the DVD surface. I have to return the original set and this replacement set too. I hope this gets straightened out so I can enjoy the set in the near future!!
1,"a paean to ""goodness""...","Only a philosopher ineluctably wed to rationalism could conceive of a title like FREEDOM WITHIN REASON without intending irony. I just love it when philosophers, comfortable in their belief of self-superiority, make statements like, ""...and so we see that ordinary people are perhaps justified in thinking that they can make up their own minds about important moral issues..."" (paraphrasing). Rehashed ethical humanism, old fish."
1,Masterpiece ... of modern crackpottery.,"One would be hard put to find a better example of modern delusional thinking, willful overinterpretation of prosaic events (i.e., dead cows rotting on the range, etc.) and just plain loonieness than this book."
1,Boring,"This game is SOOOO BORING. The races were so hard. If you like a better racing game, buy Cars."
1,quad desert furry is not good,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!! I bought it and I was ripped off. It is extremely hard, the graphics are blurry, and even a blade of grass makes you fall!!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."
1,Would've give it a zero if possible...,"I bought this game for 10 bucks at a department store, and sold at a pawn shop the next day for 7 bucks. I feel like I ripped the pawn shop off. There are no different levels, just one with different check points. Running over anything at any speed makes you fly off your blurry square thing they call a quad. It takes 20 minutes to beat it, and took maybe less for them to make this steaming pile of desert fecal matter."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is easily the best game in the entire universe. I have about every game known to man and this is my favorite. I love how stupid the steering is and how fake it is. I also love that you crash due to anything. I also love how short the game is. Took me 20 minutes to beat it. TWICE!! Its awesome, you have no control of your charachter or bike and you cant choose the level or anything. But you do get to choose wether you want arcade or challenge mode. This game sucks. Dont buy it."
5,One Of The Best,"I can honestly say, I read alot of stories online and from reading all of them Accidental Love is one of my favorites, would prolly explain why I just bought it along with another one of my favorites Tropical Storm. The story has a solid story line with characters that just draw you in. The online version I sat down and ended up reading the entire thing in one night I couldn't stop reading. It definatly pulls you in and doesnt let you go."
3,Unlikely Storyline,The characters were great and the romance fine. The premise of how they met was utterly ridiculous. Some of the rich versus poor stuff was a bit much.
1,waste of time,"Like someone else mentioned on here, it's like a hetero romance, but with two women. I basically skipped all the love scenes because they were making me gag. (And the ""I love you"" bit during those scenes was so repetitive that I was getting pretty annoyed.) Also, I couldn't help but look at Rose as something of a Mary Sue. She was way too perfect and conveniently everything Ronnie wanted in a woman. It took forever to get anywhere, and the plot was really hard to believe. No one acts all lovingly towards a stranger unless there's something wrong with them. If I were Rose, I'd be a little freaked out that this woman who appeared out of nowhere was treating me like some potential love interest or like we'd known each other for years.Seriously, unless you want to read some cheesy, soap opera-like romance (with ""strong hands"" and tears galore) in a book filled to the brim with typos, stay far away from ""Accidental Love."""
5,Great DVD-storage bang for your buck,"If you are looking for a clean and modern-looking, efficient and low-cost DVD storage solution, this is it. Most other DVD storage units in the same price range as the Typhoon hold 50-80 fewer DVDs and take up more space to boot!Unlike some other reviewers' products, my Typhoon came perfectly intact, no scratches or scuffs anywhere. Each piece was clearly labeled and all hardware came neatly packaged and separated by label (no hunting for which screw is ""Q"" and which is ""H"" like many other ""assembly required"" units!) Instructions were clear and simple.Overall--it looks very good, especially for the price. I will soon be purchasing another for the remainder of our DVD collection!"
4,dvd storage,"after reviewing picture and instructions, there was no problem with assembly.good product for the price"
1,Waiting a week and still no replacememt piece.,"Customer Servive is horrible. I ordered this product last wednesday and her it is a week and 2 days and I have yet to recevive the 2 defective peices that came with the product. One person said email and oh we will look for your request, yest here i sit with a 1/4 finished product looking like a peice of trash in my brand new living room. Get something better if you can. not worth the hassle."
1,JUNK,Upon receipt I had a feeling this was going to be a piece of unwanted junk. Particle board with wooden pegs do not make for a decent addition to this household. Poor fitting parts which need 10 sets of hands to get them together.Pass this one by ... do the research before purchasing.
4,Good,"It arrived quickly and had easy-to-read assembly instructions. After assembly, its seems quite sturdy and holds lots of items. While it was not quite what I was originally looking for, it is exactly what I expected for what was listed. It is a good product."
4,Usable storage,This storage unit works well for the price. You will need a couple of extra hands to help put it together but all the pieces are well marked and the instructions are easy to understand. It looks very nice once it's totally assembled.
4,You get what you pay for!,"I love this shelf, regardless of its small flaws (the simple press board, the poor packaging, etc) because of its ability to fit a lot of CD/DVDs into a small space. This shelf does exactly what it claims, fits CDs in a turntable shelf.This product is just like something you would buy at Office Depot/Max or IKEA, and you should know that considering the low price. I think the cost is equivalent for the product, and I couldn't ask for me.On a side note, my box had a piece missing, which was VERY frustrating, but when I called the company that makes the product, they shipped me a new piece right away, and were more than happy to offer any other extra parts I wanted. Great customer service!"
4,Kind of fragile !!!,"I assembled it myself and it was easy to do, but it seems like it's a bit fragile, looks like it's gona last a bit but not too long... For the price I think it's a great bargain."
4,Small but very functional,"I purchased this to organize my dvd and bluerays after my boyfriend and I moved and he hogged all the shelves in the living room for his huge collection of concert DVDs. The unit is slighlty shorter than I anticipated but holds more than my DVDs and Blue Rays. I used one side to hold my controllers for my WII and my Sirius Satellite receiever when not in use. I must say that I really appreciate the spinner feature as I tucked it away in a corner of our bedroom. The only gripe I have is that all the pieces were not marked so that I accidently installed one divider with an exposed unfisnihsed edge, but it was not that obvious. I would highly recommend the use of carpenters' glue before fastening."
5,good value,An excellent product. It helped me to read other reviews so that I could anticipate the one hour time to assemble. It is easy to assemble. I like the storage capacity of the product.
2,step down,I have read most Harlans' books and find this one a step down. I am really going to struggle to get through it.
4,"Even when Harlan Coben was first writing, he was good!!","I have read all of Mr. Coben's novels and I have enjoyed every single one of them. This was the only book that I had not read as it was his very first novel and I was not disappointed.As you read the book some of the characters remind me of some of the characters in his later novels. Sports themed, strong characters, smooth flowing storyline that does not let you put the book down. Excellent twists and turns with a heck of a great climax! What more could you ask for in a novel?Having written this book in his early 20's you can see his flair for writing and it has only gotten better as he has aged!Looking forward to many more novels of Mr. Coben's!"
2,Not his best work,"I am a huge Harlan Coban fan, and I didn't like this one at all. It's the first book of his I havent really liked."
2,Quite a let down,"The whole premise for this book is ridiculous. Why would someone wanting to change his life think that changing his face & going home was any sort of option? If an author is going to set part of his book in another country he should get the language right. As an Australian I cringed whilst reading the ""Australian"" dialogue & our sheriffs aren't the same as US sheriffs.A disappointing book that should have been tidied up before release. Generally a Harlan Coben book rates 5 stars."
4,"totally preposterous, yet compulsive reading!","'Play Dead', the first book by the very successful and talented Harlan Coben, is a surprisingly decent if you don't take it too seriously. True to form, Coben dishes out some very interesting characters and a plot with numerous twists. Okay the main theme of a basketball star faking his death is rather lame. But the subsequent search for truth by his wife is actually rather interesting, and Coben draws out this character very well. Most amazon.com reviewers have panned this book. But I think it is only slightly sub-par to the average Harlan Coben book (, yet considerably worse than his best).Bottom line: a super beach read, nothing more. Recommended."
4,Early Work is Good!,"Just finished reading PLAY DEAD, and I really liked it. I don't know why there is negativity about the storyline. All suspense novels have those elements of super coincidence and a bit of unbelievability. As a big fan of Harlan Coben's work, I expected to like it and I did. I was happy that the ending brought the main characters together again, that is what I wanted to see. I enjoyed trying to piece it all together, and I think fans of Coben's other books should read it!"
2,PEEEEEWWWWWW!!!!!!,"IF THIS HAD BEEN THE FIRST HARLAN COBEN BOOK I HAD READ, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LAST. I'VE ONLY GOTTEN THROUGH ABOUT 2/3 OF IT AND EVERY TIME I PUT IT DOWN, I'M SCRATCHING MY HEAD AS TO WHY I EVEN PICKED IT UP AGAIN. I KEEP HOPING IT WILL GET BETTER, BUT IT HASN'T YET.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET HIS LATER ONES."
2,What a letdown!,"As a big Harlan Cobin fan, I could not believe how really bad this book was, so childishly written with a predictable ending that I figured out halfway through. I did not realize until I finished (and what a corny ending) that it was his first book. He sure has improved."
2,Play Dead,yikes! not even close to his later writings...but you can sense the lurking possibilities and talent even with this rather disappointing first try.
3,Not his best but still good,I love Harlan Coben and have read all of his books. This one was a bit tedious in spots (unusual for him) but there are twists throughout which keep you interested and wanting to read to the end. He is an excellent writer though this was not his best. But everyone has to start somewhere.
4,Nicely done!,"After the first chapter I was hooked. I read this book as long as possible, never wanting to put it down until finished. The author did a good job of developing her characters and capturing the essence of voodoo. There was some language, but none that seemed to be used out of context. I was totally surprised by the ending. I will definitely be following up with another of her titles."
4,Interesting read,"I know this seems to have a bad Rep but I actually enjoyed it. fair enough it confused me in parts and other bits were obvious but I liked the story. read it in a few hours, didn't want to put it down."
1,Listen when the author makes apologies for his work in his own preface,"I read the preface of this book before I started to read it, something I almost never do. In it, the author make excuses for his effort, saying it was his first novel. That should have been a red flag. I should have heeded the warning. The story is ridiculous, and the ending even more so. It reads more like a bad soap opera than a mystery. I just didn't buy it- not the motive or the person he finally picked to make the killer. Find something else to read, by another author."
1,This book is dead,I always read an entire book no matter how bad it is. Reading this book was a real chore. The story could have been told in no more than 20 pages. It just goes and on discussing trival details that the read could care less about. Don't waste your money.
1,Awful. Wanting it to end and it just goes on and on and on,"I've read a few Harlan Coben books. Harlan Coben is a fabulous writer. This is not even close to a fabulous book. It's tedious, its characters are unbelievable, and I should have stopped reading after reading the author's apology preface. I just wanted it to end and it went on and on and on.There's lots of good Coben books. Don't chose this one to read because this is not one of them."
1,Blah,"First of all let me start by saying I am a huge Harlan Coben fan. I picked up this book for the simple reason I hadn't yet read it. A quarter of the way through, I was wondering if I was the only one who thought the book was so horrible. I found one review who referenced the author's own disclaimer in the front. Mr. Coben actually says if this is the first book of his you're going to read, put it back and try another. In other words even he knows it sucks. But hey, he's making money off it right? One of the few books I put down and walked away from."
1,Disappointing,"I didn't find the book satisfying at all. It rambled on and on. It really felt more like a romance novel than Coben's standard fare. The ""plot twists"" seemed more like random oddities than a thoughtful process. If this was the first book that I had ever read of Coben's, I would never read another."
1,I Want My Money Back!!!,"Mr Coben should have insisted to his publisher that PLAY DEAD continue to play dead. I managed to read 30% of this book before removing it (permanently) from my Kindle. The plot is amateurish to say the least with the usual totally predictable characters. As a soap this story might succeed with ""little old ladies"" on afternoon TV.Quite a few reviewers have outlined the plot/characters so I will not. The only reason for this review is to add my one-star which might save some of you a few dollars and hours better used reading almost anything else.Shame on you Harlen. Why put a disclaimer in the book....I already bought it?"
3,Bridget's Review,I enjoyed this book. I wouldn't say that it was one of my favorites but it was definitely worth reading. It was a little bland in places and could have used a little more creativity. All in all I would give the book three stars.
1,Never Buy Coben Again,"Like so many of you, I grabbed this off the rack because I'm a Harlan Coben fan. Read about thirty pages, then checked the front to see when it was published, thinking this trash couldn't be something new. And I was right! Yahooooo, I spent money on a terrible book! Suckered again!Next ACTUALLY NEW Coben book: buy used! The one after that: buy used! It will take a while before I spend money on anyone who would pass off such a piece of junk as new. I really have no respect for Coben. Did he make money? Yep. Did he lose respect? Yep. Which was more valuable to you, Mr. Coben?"
1,Train wreck...,"Sadly, since the book was on a ""new in paperback"" stack, I didn't look inside to see the disclaimer. If I had, this book would not have made the trip home. It is truly like watching a train wreck in slow motion..."
1,Do Not Buy this book!!!,I bought this because I really like Coben's books - and I missed his disclaimer page...sad to say. I couldn't even finish it - I read maybe 75 pages and put it down. He is absolutely correct when he said not to buy it - so that's my warning to anyone else...do not buy this book!!! He should never have allowed it to be reissued...and the fact that he did allow really shakes my confidence in his commitment to his loyal readers.
4,This a first novel,"This is a first book that shows potential of the author that we now read. Coben writes a letter explaining not to read this book if this is your first book by him. This book is for fans who enjoy reading Coben and missed his first books. The storyline is chopped and dragged out some but at the same time, you want to find out how the truth comes out about David. Alot of authors are reissuing their first novels and it is interesting to see how they have developed over the years."
2,Definitely an old novel,I love Harlan Coban novels. But I must say that I was sorely disappointed over Play Dead. The novel went on much too long and the constant reference to the female character's beauty got old fast. There's only so many times you can right about someone's beauty. I realize that this was either his first or one of his first novels so I shouldn't be so critical. I'm just glad I rented it from the library rather than purchasing the book. I'm still a HUGE fan of his and his current novels show how he's matured in his writing.... Harlan is an excellent author.
3,Predictable.,If you're a Harlan Coben fan you will definitely know this is his first book. The story line isn't as suspenseful or thrilling as those that have come later. Still a good read but predictable.
1,"cheesy, dumb and predictable",this was the cheesiest book I have read in a long time! This was also the first book written by Coben that I have decided to pick (the title sounded intriguing) and I think I am not going to pick this author again.At first we have this hot model who is also the smartest cookie in the world. Her fiancee is also a HOT model who happens to be the best basketball star in the world. Then there is the model's best friend who is the politically correct African American lady who ALSO happens to be a model......and the list of Coben's stupid ideas goes on...
2,skip this and read any of Harlan Coben's other books,"I'm a huge fan of Coben's, but this book is a stinker. I understand it was his first book; apparently he was still honing his skill. Play Dead is implausible, way too drawn-out, and predictable."
1,0 stars,"Absolutely one of the worst books I have ever read. Coben proves himself an incredibly lazy writer. Instead of trying to bang out as many books as possible, he should concentrate on writing a creative, thoughtful product. Completely implausible and contrived. So angry with myself for wasting the time reading this. Will positively never read another of his books. I resent the fact that someone of this caliber is published."
3,Stick with Bolitar!,"I picked the book up at a discount book store only because I have read all or most of Coben's other books. I'll admit, after reading the authors comments in the front of the book, I almost put it down again. I didn't.....wish I had! It was an OK book for a first time writer, but come on, after all the Bolitar books, release this as a comparible story?I will stick with the Myron Bolitar series."
2,Very poorly written and convoluted,"First I will state for what ever record, I am a huge Harlan Coben fan. However this book is easily his worst book to date. Harlan does us all a service by putting in a preface that this book is not a new issue but a reissue of previous work. I am sure that his publishers loved that, but it is obvious that his publisher tried to slide one by Harlan Coben's fans by reissuing this book and pretending that it was something new.As for the book itself, the plot is far too long, the characters are not his typical sympathetic and believable people caught in extraordinary circumstances. I can see some of the characteristics which Coben uses in later books to become so great and easy to read but in this book it falls very flat. As a Harlan Coben fan I would suggest you save both your time and money and read his later books. He gets much better after this."
2,Not a great read,"The author says this is his first book and from reading it, he was not kidding. I found the characters to be superficial and predictable as was the whole story.The book is almost like a made for tv movie. A bit cheesy and predictable. Glad that's over."
1,I must not be a mystery reader,I got 12% into this book and gave myself permission to not read two mysteries within a year of each other.
1,Play Dead: Dead allege way,"This was a stupid book, at least three times a long as it justified being for such a simple plot. I'm sorry I wasted the time reading the whole book. Should have trashed it after 10 or so chapters. I was stupid to stick with it. Probably the worst book I've read this year, & I've read a lot. Based on this sample, I've read my last Coben."
4,Very good for his first novel!,"I've recently discovered Harlan Coben and have been just tearing through his books. He is really fantastic. I recently came across ""Play Dead"", his first novel, at the library. OK, it's not his best, but it was still quite a page-turner. It is great for a first novel, and it is also very nice to see how far Mr. Coben has come in his writing career. There are lots of suprises and they are all very fair."
2,play dead,love coben but he needed an editor on this project. amzed he was able to sell the idea. still the writing and the characters show all the promise of The great storyteller he has become.
3,Play Dead,"This was a very old (first?) Coben book. It was interesting to go back and read his earlier stuff, but it wasn't on par with his newer books. Enjoyed it anyway."
2,Kind of Silly,"First I do not think Amazon.com should have the review from Publishers weekly in here, with all of the spoilers that it discloses. The school Library journal review (Which follows the Publishers weekly review) doesn't have any of the spoilers in it. I think this book is like most of the Coben Books, they are thrillers which keep the reader focused and entertained, but the endings are usually let downs. I liked a lot of the Bolitars, but Coben really nailed it with ""Caught"". ""Play Dead"" has just too many coincidences to be believable. If you are interested in all of the coincidences read the Publishers Weekly review. I have no quarrel with the amount of stars that any reviewer gives ""Play Dead"". I had the book as 4 stars until the conclusion."
1,Horrible,"I discovered Harlan Coben by accident at the used book store. I loved that book so I went on Amazon to see what else of his was there. This one was tauted, I believe, as a new release. I couldn't wait to get it. Now I can't wait to take it to the used book store to get some credit to purchase something well worth reading.I didn't know this was his first book. It should never have been published. I wrote better than this in high school and never got an A on any of my assignments. As I was reading this book, I kept critiquing it. I abhore wasting money and this was a double abhorrence - loss of money and a bad read."
5,Too much Air.,My son thought you could pump the tires on the power washer to 60 PSI like a bike tube. 10-minutes in the sun and those babies exploded.I received these new tubes with speedy delivery and fixed up my power washer. Excellent.
5,Worked perfectly for my hand truck,"One of the tires of our hand truck got sliced through both the tire and the tube. I checked locally but couldn't find any replacement tires and tubes, and found these tubes on Amazon. I paired them with thesetires by Oregon, and they worked together perfectly.Note that getting the replacement tires onto the rims is a chore. I found a video on a popular video site by searching on ""How to Mount a Small Tire on Wheel"", which shows a technique to use small c-clamps and a large screwdriver to get the wheels on the rims. It worked great, although it was still a challenge.Now that the tires and tubes are mounted, the hand truck is ready to go. We already moved a few things with it, and these tires and tubes work great, and feel like good quality for the price."
4,"Not 5 stars because it's not that easy to install, but then again so are all the other tubes like it.","Not 5 stars because it's not that easy to install, but then again so are all the other tubes like it. I couldn't find it any where around town. And I bought it for a good price here on Amazon."
4,Works great -Very hard to get these tires back on,"This is the tube you need to fix that lawn hose caddy flat, but beware these little tire are difficult to get on!"
4,A compilation of the most under-rated of Irish tenors.,"Louis Browne is the most accomplished and probably least known of the current crop of Irish tenors. It is a most unfortunate circumstance for as this collection shows, his voice is uniquely beautiful and his way with a song is charming and honest. It is too bad that this c.d. is all that is presently available of this great artist. The sound is imperfect but acceptable and the content is representative. It is certainly worth its bargain price. But more from Louis Browne would be welcome indeed. If only he could get one-tenth the recording time that the infinitely over-rated Frank Patterson gets!"
2,"What to, not How to","This book has great pictures and good design themes, but if you're looking for a book on how to finish a basement, this is no help. I've gotten some ideas from this book, but I still don't know where to start with the actuall construction."
3,"Good pictures, short on details","This book has several pictures and is full of ideas, however, it falls short on the details. Good for someone who is hiring the work out; not doing the work themselves. The book shows styles, and fixtures that are circa mid-1990s."
2,Not worth it,There are 2 cd's in this and you could say they were duplicated. Nothing at all I expected. Very disappointed
1,Mathis-DVD,"This product arrived in a reasonable time. However, the DVD had a crack in it and would not play. I notified the seller immediately and they immediately refunded my money. I would give seller another chance and would buy from them if I found something I wanted that they had. Appreciate their prompt attention to the problem."
5,The Great Johnny Mathis,"Johnny Mathis is without a doubt the greatest male vocalist alive. His spectacular voice in unmatched and I am so looking forward to attending his performances. I am a resident of Okemos, Michigan and I am anxious to see him at Soaring Eagle in Mount Pleasant, Michigan but their are not tickets available as of yet.Derek O'Neal"
5,Terrific Show at a Great Price,"We received this tape, and immediately it became my mother's favorite. She's confined to the house, and loves the video-music DVDs, and she ADORES Johnny Mathis. This is beautifully produced, has great sound, and is a full 90 minutes in length. With the interviewer chatting with him, you have additional insight into the terrific man he is. I haven't tired of it yet, and that's saying a lot, since Mom asks for it once a day!"
5,One hell of a bad ass subwoofer,Words cannot describe this sub woofer! It is by far the best sub money can buy. It is truly amazing to hear and feel the output of this sub. I do not know why Yamaha stopped making it but it is just truly amazing. The power that this baby puts out even with volume up only 30 percent is incredible! All I can say is that if you get your hands on one of these you will have to consider yourself lucky as can be. There is no way you can go wrong with this sub. Truly a masterpiece of Yamaha and an extreme asset to any home theater!
4,Very good lightweight glove,"These gloves are thicker than other nitrile, latex or poly gloves, and they last longer for similar tasks. Since they are thicker they do mask a little more sensation than the thinner gloves, and so might not be as good for small / ""need to feel"" work.I use these doing auto work, cleaning in the garage / storage, painting, etc."
1,NOT MADE IN ENGLAND,"I also purchased the Churchill China Brook Blue set of 8 (45 pieces) and the completer set, intending to have a matched set of 12. WRONG. The set of 8 was indeed made in England and contained soup bowls (listing on Amazon only says ""bowls""). The set is very nice and has high quality. The set of 4 and the completer set, however, are MADE IN COLOMBIA. The color is more saturated, the salad dishes are about 2 inches smaller than those made in England, the ""bowls"" are cereal bowls, and the vegetable bowl and platter are both smaller and less detailed than those made in England. Suggestion: if you want consistancy, order two sets of the 45 pieces and don't fool with the add-ons. Amazon could not guarantee the ancillary pieces would be from England.... despite the on-line description to that effect!"
4,Nice set but didn't match 'Product Description',"The set I received did not match the written 'Product Description' though it did match the picture. The set included the 6 3/4 inch bread & butter plates & the 6 inch cereal bowls instead of the 8 inch salad plates & 8 3/4 inch rimmed bowls (as described September, 2005.) Thus, unfortunately it doesn't match the 45 piece dinnerware set (8 place settings) of the same design which I also ordered.Having said all that, it is still a very nice set. The 6 inch cereal bowls will probably be used more often in our family than the rimmed bowls. The quality seems very good & it was packaged securely."
3,Price?,"I ordered two sets of the service for 4 and the completer set at the beginning of this month (March). When I ordered them they were $49.99 for the dishes and $44.99 for the completer set. Today, March 25, the service for 4 is $88! Why has the price risen so much in a matter of weeks? The service for 8 is even more outrageous! I am enjoying my new dishes. They arrived intact, though there are a few ""chips"" on the side of them and color discrepancies as well. Decent for what I paid, but NOT for the price they are being offered for now. I will not order more sets until the price comes back down."
3,Not made in England,"One of the things that influenced my decision to buy these dishes is that I liked the idea of them being made in England. I ordered the 20-piece service for four. They arrived, and on the backs they are stamped ""Made in Columbia."" I'm sending them back, hoping to get a replacement set made in England as it says in the description. HOWEVER: if they were priced lower, I would like them even though they were made in Columbia: they're still nice dishes, and pretty. I don't want to pay this much for dishes not made in England, though."
3,NOT MADE IN ENGLAND!,"I guess I'll repeat what some others have said. These dishes are made in Columbia, not England. I have Churchill dishes like these that were made in England. The English dishes don't chip and have worn very well. I wanted dishes from the same place because presumably they would be made with the same materials and be just as strong. I was very disappointed to see that the dishes I bought over this website were made in Columbia when Amazon said they were made in Englad. To be fair to the manufacturer, the quality of the Columbian dishes looks the same as the ones made in England. I won't know for a while how they hold up."
5,Worthwhile,"Although not the easiest read, it is perhaps the best book I've read on the emerging/ pre-communist cinema in China."
5,I love this movie,"I love this movie but wish they would make better and put on DVD, VHS is really fuzzy. Scary little story! I watched this as a kid and never forgot it!"
5,Lancelot's First Adventures,"Lancelot du Lac is one of the great characters of Arthurian legend. For children, his story is best broken up into smaller more easily understood sections. In ""Young Lancelot"", Robert San Souci wisely limits the scope of his story from Lancelot's birth up until the point that the Lady of Lake introduces him to King Arthurs court and reveals to Lancelot his true name. The story focuses on how the arrogant young Lancelot learns compassion. All and all, this is very well written book with a nice illustrations. Having finished this book, I am going to purchase Robert San Souci's three other Arthurian books."
1,Neutralballoonbooks,"I ordered Amulets of the Goddess: Oracle of Ancient Wisdom/Contains Book and a Set of 27 Amulets from Neutralballoonbooks. I paid $89 for the set, but was mailed an old paperback book WITHOUT THE AMULETS. I could have bought the used book for $35, or used the internet for the symbols. Very disappointing ! Would like a refund. """
5,Love It,Beautiful and wonderful. Enjoying the amulets and book oh so much. Was completely surprised by how wonderful the product is and there is bag to put the amulets in. Will enjoy for years to come.
1,No Amulets,I got the book with no amulets so had to return it.If anyone has the book + amulets for sale I would love to know ........ :((May 2012)
2,Amulets of the Goddess:Oracle of Ancient Wisdom,"Received the book quickly in good shape, I was disappointed that the twentyseven amulets did not come with the book , as advertised. Would not have ordered if I had known it would arrive incomplete."
1,Falsely advertised.,"Was very disappointed to received the book without the attached amulets as was advertised. They did send me a return mail receipt, hopefully the refund will be promptly forthcoming so I can purchase the book and amulets elsewhere."
2,"Beethoven Overtures, the Hanover Band","The sound quality is good, especially considering that it was recorded in the early 90s. The playing is musical, alive and vital. The interpretations are good. The only problem is the intonation. While the strings play well in tune, the winds, especially the brass leave something to be desired. This is a consistent problem, not an occasional one. It's not cringingly bad, but it's enough that it's difficult to relax into it. If one listens to the Gardiner Beethoven cycle, one doesn't notice this problem, so it can't be a problem that can't be overcome with period instruments."
5,The world stopped!,"The world stopped for me on this album for the entire 12 songs! It was only myself and my new C.D. Theese guys sound amaizing. The vocals were the first thing to grab my attention. The singer has a huge range, everything from soaring highs to low melodic chants. The dynamic range is huge on this album, they know when to hit you hard, and when to soften it up. The musicianship is flawless on everybodys part! Its a reminder on how hard good music is to find theese days and what a reward it is when you do find that special album that stops time."
3,My new dishes,"I like the dishes I bought a lot. The only problems I have is that:1) I ordered 2 sets of the dishes. On the first set of 40 pc. they all looked a like. Although the color of blue seemed lighter than I thought. On the second set of 20 Pc. They were a darker blue than the first set, that color was more the color I thought they would be. Also the edges on the first set seemed to be more sculpted than the ones on the second set.2) they said they were micro wave safe. I have used one of the dishes in the micro wave and it got pretty warm to the touch.Other than that I am happy with the design and the dishes them selves. I am still waiting for that last of the mugs I ordered."
3,Not sure what the fuss is,"I'm not entirely sure what the point of reviewing a DVD player that has been off the market for who knows how long, but here we go.I bought this thing for $25 about two years ago. It still works. It is in my bedroom, and I don't have the noise problems other people mention. I turn it off, it stays off.It's not the prettiest thing in the world, and it doesn't have any nice features, but it works and was $25."
1,does dvd doesnt do as it says rca dvd all region its a nono,the dvd i have purchased does not play all region dvd the reason why i bought the item but as soon as i recieved it does not play all dvd region
3,SURPRISINGLY GOOD,"This is actually an above-average B-movie. Troma fans should love it, the script is actually quite good. A fun and funny movie."
3,Not as good as I had hoped!,"This movie wasn't as good as we thought it might be. It's not my usual type of movie but was bought for my oldest sons for his birthday, (he is 29) And altho I didn't watch much of it he found it was rather dull,tho gory enough."
2,Gettin' Klowny Wit It,"Klown Kamp Massacre is a pretty disappointing slasher movie. There is some awesomeness contained within, but it's mostly just stoopid. And the ending is just wetarded."
5,"Funny, keeps you guessing","Our family had seen this movie years ago and we all enjoyed it! I've been looking all over to buy this one but NO ONE had it. Was I thrilled when I found this on Amazon.com. Thank You, you are going to make someone's Christmas very special this year!"
4,Excellent fun movie,"I saw it again after more than two decades and it was very enjoyable also for my son and husband who had never seen it before. The smooth cut, cinematography and switching from one to the other scene in similar vignets hit me at the time and still works. Of course Ennio Morricone's music tops it all off. Recommend this one whole heartedly and am buying the video now. I don't buy videos that often..."
5,Funny and moving western,"Great movie! I hadn't seen this movie for years. I happened across a copy at the local video store and was mesmerized. If you liked Fonda in Once Upon a Time in the West, you won't be disappointed with this movie. It's quirky and fun, yet poetic and moving as well. I'm going to add this film alongside the Dollars trilogy on my movie shelf."
4,Sergio Leone fans will love this,"You will love this if you are a Sergio Leone or spaghetti western fan, or even if you don't think you are. Many surprises and a couple of nice twists. You should watch it. Funny and a lot of inside jokes."
4,"The "" Apocolypse Now"" of westerns!","Great movie! But... The quality of the video recording was quite annoying! There has to be a better one out there somewhere. I pray when it comes out on DVD that it's in letterbox. I've seen this flick on tv and it seems that this vhs recording was super zoomed when formatted. Most of the best scene in the movie, where Fonda has his big showdown, is lost ""side to side"". If your a big Terence Hill fan and your ""jonsing"" for this movie then click away otherwise wait for the remastered DVD edition."
5,so freaking funny,Well you'll need depends for this one.The slap scene is so great and i love the brother ... he is so grumpy.Enjoy this series!
5,A very touching movie,"this is a very touching movie, I am not into westerns but I just love this movie. It will go on to make many more generations laugh and maybe even shed a tear."
5,The scene in the bar shooting the glasses is unbeatable!,"A true funny western, hard to find in the video stores"
3,"Great film, shame about the tape quality","One of my all-time favorites, and rather hard to find in Europe (odd, as it is countries like Germany where the Italian spaghetti-western genre has enjoyed greatest succes). Inserting the tape into my VCR, I was really looking forward to seeing this gem again after quite a few years, but I was sourly disppointed at the very poor quality of this particular recording. Though there are worse, this was clearly below standard, and I'm surprised it's not been mentioned more often in the reviews below. 5 stars for the film, 2 for the recording"
4,And excellent 'B' type western with some classic scenes.,"If you are a western fan and loved 'Silverado' then you will like this flick. Not as good, but some classic scenes including the drinking/shooting glasses scene with the 'slapping' gun fight are outstanding. Dry wit and dark/sarcastic humor with memorable one-liners. Don't watch this for the 'shootem up' scenes, it is better than that. It does move a tad slow."
3,"It's extremely funny when it's funny, at times slo o o w . .","Again, the picture quality is poor. After seeing this many years ago and thinking it was soooo funny, we found we liked the Trinity Series with Terence Hill and Bud Spencer better."
2,How did it end???,I bought this video as a gift for my Trinity-lovin hubby. He enjoyed the whole movie right up until the very (end??) Whoever materminded the production of this particular video has alot to learn. The video tape ran out right at the climax of the gunfight at what we think was near the end of the movie. We will have to wait and hopefully it will come on TV so we can see just how much this poorly edited video cut out.
2,Overrated,"How this movie can have almost 5 stars? The dialogue is terrible, the music is terrible, the voice dubbing is terrible.The camera work is decent for it's time, and sure it has guns, but come on -- this movie is really bad."
2,Leone's best not particularly good,"Yes this may be one of Sergio Leone's best films but unfortunately his best is not particularly good. It is a thoughtful, interesting story, as many of his movies tell, and well acted, but not very well directed or filmed. His amateurish use of pans and zooms are distracting and the overly long scenes which do little to advance the story are often rather boring without conveying much of the suspense they are meant to suggest. I have often wondered as I watch his movies, if he has spent much time watching well made films, or merely cut his teeth on silent slapstick and just rushed out to make his own. They were popular I suppose, in an era when people were searching for something new, but his techniques have not aged well and are thankfully gone from more modern cinema. He came and went, and left his mark, but it wasn't a very high one. If you like Sergio Leone movies, you will probably love this one, just don't expect anything more than his usual offering."
1,Phewwy!! What a stinker!,"What a waste of time. Maybe I don't have the proper appreciation of so-called ""spaghetti westerns"", but I know a really stupid (not funny) movie when I see one."
5,"Awesome movie, but low quality encoding","I've been looking high and low for this movie for years on DVD. For content alone it gets 5 stars.But the problems I have are in the encoding job that was done. My only assumption is that they didn't have a master copy, it looks like it was encoded from a VHS tape at a low bit rate, and the colors are largely washed out. The sound is variable, starting off very loud in the opening score, then dropping back later."
3,okay movie,movie is not as good as the other trinity moves so parts kindof boring but over all and okay movie
4,Decent quality at decent price,"I'd been trying to compile a collection of old spaghetti westerns, yet missed a few Terence Hill' movies (""My Name is Nobody"" being one). Finally broke down and bought this one - decent quality at decent price. Good vendor!"
5,If I had to pick an all time favorite...,"My dad sat me down to watch My Name is Nobody when I was ten years old (mid thirties now) - it was my favorite movie then, and it is still one of my favorites now. This is a special movie. At it's heart it is about having a hero, and it takes me back to a time when my dad was my hero."
5,"""Nobody"" should miss this movie!",I have not seen this movie in over 20 years when it was on television so I decided to order a copy. This brings back a lot of good memories. Terence Hill certainly made this western worth watching. Entertaining all the way along with Henry Fonda. Of course I can't forget the Wild Bunch riding in the movie. My Name is Nobody...good fun movie!
3,Is that all?,I love this film (it is one of the few comedy Italian Westerns that travels well) but I was disappointed that there were no extras at all on the disc. The picture quality is great though.I hear there is a French double disc set out there. Maybe I ought to try that.
5,Worth the Buy,"I bought this movie for my father. I haven't watched it, but he absolutely loved it. All of his friends love it too. I'm so happy I bought it for him."
3,Comedy of instant murdering,"It is a story of establishing the industry in the US West as some production supposed be legalized for legalizing mafia members benefiting much from.Then, some top players got own interests and one of them decided making it to Europe for the honourable retirement. It was completed with a helpful hand of a younger dude nobody-was-faster-him, stinking his finger up the ass of hairdresser a whole screen demonstrated during a cast listed.Rather homoerotic stuff of much blood and murdering."
2,I don't get it...,"I can't believe this movie gets such raving reviews! I love Terence Hill, and I am generally a big fan of Leone/Morricone productions, but come on! There is no real story line, and I hate to say it, Hill is extremely annoying in it and is acting badly. I eventually had to stop watching. Nothing made sense to me, and I am very open minded. Sorry, I was really looking forward to watching this, but boy, this was not good!"
5,what luck,I would like to thank the person who had this dvd for sale. I have been looking for it for a long time. This movie is an all time classic. I think everyone should own a copy of this. Thank-you for having this to buy
3,Good Entertainment,This movie has excellent humor and very funny parts. The filming of some scenes in fast motion adds to the frequent humor. At times it moves slow but overall it is to be enjoyed.
3,Movie GOOD....Quality of DVD....HORRIBLE.,"I love this movie, a unique vision of european/western romanticism, accentuated by ,the youthful vigor of Hill (Nobody) and the weary, retrospective, aging gunfighter Fonda (Jack Beauregard). A movie I enjoyed as a youngster, and I still enjoy now. HOWEVER, its hard to enjoy a movie, any movie, when there are so many DVD dropouts and image distortions. The DVD I received was really poor quality...and that affected this movie experience on a very deep level."
5,A tremendous movie,"Easily one of the best of the Trinity series. Barring the lack of Bud Spencer, it can hold it's own against even the great Blazing Saddles as far as I am concerned."
2,Sherlock Holmes review,"I like any of the Rathbone/Bruce movies but the picture quality of these videos is not very good: fuzzy, off center and too big for a 20"" TV screen. You get what you pay for."
3,"DENZEL AND WHITNEY HOT, OPRAH NOT.","NOT A BAD BOOK, THE TWO TITLE STARS AND CICELY TYSON AND WESLEY SNIPES ARE GOOD.WHERE IS SYDNEY POITIER? DIANE SANDS? ISABELLE SANFORD?MANY GREAT BLACK STARS ARE MISSING. A SEQUEL WOULD HELP."
1,Garbage,"This futon is nothing more than cheaply welded garbage. The welds holding the metal mesh together on the bottom of the frame have begun to break after little more than two months of use. The matress is also very thin and after two months of use has become very uncomfortable as the frame can easily be felt through it.I wouldn't take another if it was given free to me, so don't blow any money on this garbage."
2,Great idea - poorly executed.,"The price seemed great and I really liked the modern look. When I took it out of the box got disappointed by how cheap everything looked. Assembly was very easy - it took my boyfriend about 15 minutes (the most). The design is really great - it's very compact, perfect for small spaces and would look awesome if materials were a little bit better. Great idea - poorly executed. Would gladly pay a lil more for this futon if it was a better quality product. My main concern is that the construction seems like it wouldn't last too long. I feel like I should attach ""sit carefully"" tag to it before anybody comes over."
1,Avoid this flimsy thing!,"The concept of a futon mattress atop slats is actually comfortable and I lay on it for a week happily until I made the mistake of putting too much focused pressure and snapped/broke two of the very fragile slats by climbing onto it with my knee first. Also, I called the manufacturer on the first day to tell them that the filling inside the cushion covers was making me itch. These are not cushions with a black cover. This is a black cover filled with recycled fabric pulp. The rep was not interested in responding to my complaint. Don't buy this. Go to a futon store and buy something that resembles this and it will be much sturdier."
1,the frame never arrived!,"this is infuriating... what can i even do about it? the cushions (which, yeah, are not good quality) arrived, but not the frame. i would never have paid this much for just the cushion!"
3,You now need a drill!,"You need a power drill to put this desk together now. I called Step 2 because I thought they forgot to pre-drill the holes. They informed me that now they do not pre-drill anymore. You have to do it yourself. What a pain. I had to wait for my husband and wait for the battery in the drill to be charged! Bad move, Step 2."
5,Wonderful Learning Center,"We bought this for our daughter for her third birthday. She will be five in a month and she is just as thrilled with the desk as she was when we first bought it. The desk is sturdy and very durable, as is the chair. One of the best features of the desk is that it is so easy to clean. And there is so much storage space for all of her art supplies. I do agree that the light could be a bit brighter, but with an overhead light on you really don't even need it.This is definitely one of the best things that we have ever bought her and even thought it will be two years that she has had it, it doesn't seem that she will be outgrowing it anytime soon. She has grown so much in the past two years and still there is plenty of leg room for her.I definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a desk for their child. You can't go wrong with this desk."
5,My son LOVES this desk.....,and so do I! We bought this as our 2 and a half year old's first desk and he loves sitting at it and putting all his books & art supplies in the compartments.He has all his crayons up top and ours doesn't pop off at all. He used to have to sit wherever he could find to do stuff but now he does everything at his desk. Sometimes we even let him eat a snack there.My son is very picky with toys and things we buy him so I was s thrilled that he enjoyed this so much. It was definitely worth the money!
5,Great Desk,My daughter loves this desk and I love that it has plenty of storage so that we can keep all her art supplies together. We've had the desk for a month and so far it seems to be worth the money.
4,Good read,"Love the stories, Good writing ,good suspense, excellent reading about this time period and the craftiness of the character and friends."
4,A Classic Tale,"I have loved the Scarlet Pimpernel ever since I saw the Leslie Howard film back when I was young. I own a old, yellowed paperback version of the book that I enjoyed reading years ago. As my eyes have become worse over time, I choose to download the Kindle version of this book as one of my first downloads. While the version I downloaded had a few format problems, I still enjoyed it. As a fan of Pimpernel I highly recommend this book. Take it and read it. Sometimes the language and style can be a little difficult, but read it with patience and enjoy."
5,Reread from 50 years ago! Enjoyable Experience.,"I had been introduced to this book 50 years ago in high school. I was always a fan of adventure, so decided to read it again. It takes a little bit to get into the story, and some of the language seems foreign at first, but I really enjoyed it. Since it was so long ago when I first ordered it, through the high school books program, the main plot was pretty much erased from my memory, except for the gist of it. I'm passing it on to my children and their families. Hope they get as much enjoyment out of it as I did."
3,Good old classic,"This was a slow start book for me, but it picked up after a few chapters and I really enjoyed it! The seller sent it quickly and the book was in good shape."
1,"Excellent book, wretched edition","I adore this book. This edition looks like it was printed for near-sighted five year olds. It's a script created for computers, and it completely ruins the feel of the novel. Buy another edition."
3,Entertaining but melodramatic,"I grew up loving the 1980s movie version of The Scarlet Pimpernel starring Jane Seymour. So, I had really high expectations of loving the actual book as well. But to be honest, I feel the movie is the richer more engaging story.I liked the book fairly well but felt that it had too much ""telling"" and not enough ""showing."" Many pages are taken up with Marguerite's rather melodramatic mental reactions to things instead of actually seeing those things happen. Also, it seemed that the only character who we actually get to know is Marguerite. Sir Percy is interesting but not enough time is given to revealing his character."
4,"A fun read, but not a great novel","The Scarlet Pimpernel is decently written, has a fairly good (though rather predictable) story, is full of humor and romance, and is all in all an entertaining read. But let's face it: this is Romanticism of the third rank, nowhere near as good as Victor Hugo or even Alexandre Dumas.Besides the story being predictable, it lacks philosophical depth. And to the extent it has any deeper meaning, it's a rather bad one, namely that not just the excesses of the French Revolution but the revolution itself was a bad thing. Orczy is clearly sympathetic to the absurd and disgusting notion of hereditary nobility (but what did I expect from a Baroness?). So that implication undercut my enjoyment somewhat, but it was still a pretty good read.Oh yeah, and it was kind of anti-Semitic, no?Michael Page's reading of this audio edition is highly enjoyable, though. Three and a half stars."
5,Brilliant!!!,"I'm reading Orczy's The Scarlet Pimpernel with my middle school students. After studying the history of the French Revolution, they became enthralled with the book by the end of the first chapter, which effectively captures the horrors of the Reign of Terror. It's a fantastic read."
3,Hey it's free,"Hey it was free can't really knock something that's free. It's considered a classic and it's not hard to guess whot the Pimpernel is, but it is an interesting book."
4,I couldn't do 3 1/2 stars,"This was a book club selection. The first 1/3rd of the book took me over three weeks to read. The rest of the book, took me a day. The suspense got pretty heated, finally, after the first 1/3rd.I wonder who the intended protagonist here was. The book hardly showed the hero in action. Almost all mentions of him were said by friends and enemies of the S.P. The protagonist in my opinion is Marguerite Blakeney. Which makes me wonder why the title was chosen.The writing seemed odd to me as well. The narrative was easy to understand, and then the dialogue jumped out as WOW! OLD SKOOL! I had to read it slow to make heads or tales of it.I'm glad the version I had, had a glossary."
3,Fun but Melodramatic,"In this novel of the worst days of the French Revolution, the daring Scarlet Pimpernel and his loyal followers (all English gentlemen) rescue French aristocrats from the guillotine because it amuses them to do so. The true identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel is amusing and some of the ways the ""bad guys"" receive their comeuppance are classic, but much of the book was extended sections of melodramatic soul-searching, swooning, and pining by the heroine which for me detracted from my enjoyment of the book."
2,Buy A Different Copy,"The book has turned out to be enjoyable, but I want to warn folks that this particular edition is pretty poor. There is, on average, a typo every other page. It doesn't take away from the story, but it is definitely disappointing and annoying. The font is made for a computer and not for a book. And last, the introduction to the author is quoted directly from Wikipedia. Seriously, folks? Very disappointed. I wish I had bought the $4 Dover or maybe even bothered to spend more money on any other copy."
1,Not this edition!,"If you can buy any other edition of this classic book, do it. Although it has nice paper and dark bold print, the margins are narrow, there are typos, the paragraphs have extra spaces between making conversations hard to read, words that should be in italics are in CAPITAL LETTERS(which feels like being shouted at). Just not a fun reading experience because the layout is so annoying it is distracting."
4,Captured my imagination.,The Scarlet Pimpernel took me back to another time in history. It held my interest and I enjoyed reading it.
4,Fun read,"I really enjoyed reading this book. Fun intrigue, suspense, and a bit of romance. Can't wait to read more of Orczy's books."
4,This book is so much fun!,"This book is so much fun! I love the movie as well but the book's ending is much more involved and interesting. Though, who can complain about the movie? Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour! They are so fabulous!Mr. Andrews is just as delightful in person. My mother and I saw him in ""My Fair Lady"" in London and then had the pleasure of speaking with him outside the stage door after the show. It was a mid-week performance so I was the only groupie! It was most enjoyable meeting him. A true English gentleman, asking questions about me and turning the focus away from himself. Soft-spoken and kind.He was brilliant as Henry Higgins as well. What a fun memory!Well, that wasn't really a book review but I hope it was TOO tangential!"
1,This is mislabeled; it isn't Walter kaufmann's translation,This hardcopy facsimile is not Kaufmann's. It is a mixup in labeling. I have compared it with a paperback version and this isn't the same.
1,An absolute catastrophe,"It is interesting that reviewers appear to be so critical of the translation, ignoring what Goethe himself did to the Faust legend. From the annoying homunculus to the exorbitant Walpurgis Night to the self-indulgent Gretchen 'Travesty,' this is a story that never should have been written, with parts that would have been useless to try to stage. Faust and Mephistopheles were used as tools in a story that Goethe wanted to tell, rather than him telling their story. It is an overwrought nightmare.The only reason I give it one star is that the site does not permit zero.Read Christopher Marlowe's version instead."
3,"Neat Story, Bad Translation","While this version of Faust does its job in telling the story, Kaufmann sacrificed good translation for style. He mimicks the style of the German, but what rhymes in German doesn't rhyme in English. When I read it, I had to cover the page in German because as a fluent German speaker, I noticed how poorly it was translated. Some sentences are very odd. He translates ""Der Faust traegt einen Schmuck"" which means Faust wears jewelry as ""He was a dandy beau."" Read this version only for its story, not its translation."
4,des Pudels Kern,"The strength of this play is its story. Of course some quality is lost in translation and even an outstanding translator would not be able to copy the nuances of the original language. There are simply to much words and to much phrases for nearly one and the same in german. Wovon ich ein Lied singen könnte.But Goethe is not about the beauty of words, his texts are based on conflicts which would be understandable in even the worst translation.The conflict of ths play is between might and innosence, which are hard to combine. So it ist a modern theme, because there will be man seduced by power in every century. Even the desires will stay the same, a beautiful girl, respect and forbidden knowlege.The translator worked all those thoughts out and did his job quite well. Some texts can be read in no time but stay in mind for years. Faust is some of this texts, buy it!"
1,Saffron Skies,It was abridged and made absolutely no sense. It wasn't advertised as abridged. I wouldn't of bought it had I been informed it was abridged.
2,Failed Expectations,"With all the hype, I was expecting a good, solid read.The book is very episodic and skips over huge chunks of time. I am not a fan of this technique. I was looking forward to a good, comlex love story.Some of the complexity is there and some of the writing is very good.One problem I had is that I wasn't sure of the focus of the book. Was it Max and how he affected everyone around him, for better or worse, or was the book about his daughter and her circle and how she, in some ways, breaks out of Max' circle.Finally, the ending happened to quickly and left me unsatisfied. I had more questions than answers."
3,A decent read,"I thought this book would have more depth to it. I felt no sympathy for Paola, Keiran, or Francesca just disgust and I think the back cover is a little misleading, because its also about Ambers two friends Becky and Madeline. The book also was a little predictable, but I still enjoyed reading it."
2,Saffron Skies?,"This is my first Lesley Lokko book and I was expecting to be wowed, but wasn't. The blurb on the back of the book talks about two half-sisters falling in love with the same guy. That didn't happen. Instead the book focused on Amber, Becky, Madeline, and Amber's family members.A lot happened in this book that was definitely out of the ordinary. It's not a light fluffy read, so be prepared for heavy material, some thought provoking, and some that may disgust you. I have to hand it to Lesley, she sure doesn't pull her punches.Now that I know somewhat to expect, I won't be so surprised the next time I pick up a book by Lesley Lokko."
2,Stop! You're embarrassing me!,"OK, I liked it too but ""beautifully written""? ""Great book""? I don't think so. This is one of those sprawling, over-many-continents kind of books, the kind of book you read by the pool (not your own pool, the one at the hotel you stay at on vacation) or the beach (the public one) or, if you're really tight on cash, in the backyard, the kind of book that lets you live the jet-set-life vicariously. You'll get some folk doing the right thing as well as weathly brats behaving badly and a parade of couplings throughout. It's a soap opera, that's all. Enjoy it for what it is. It ain't high art, just a good read."
5,Elbow Boxing,"Outstanding!!! This is just what I was looking for. I always knew that elbow boxing in muay thai was more developed than what you see in the thai boxing. The techniques in this video are very dangerous, and that's why professional fighters don't use them in the ring. Muay boran and thai boxing are very different. Thai boxing only deals with the basic elbow strikes allowed in the ring. Boran unlocks the full use of the elbows, and Ajarn Marco and his partner give a good visual of how to execute all of the elbow strikes in traditional muay thai. Then he gives combo's and blocking techniques.After you get comfortable with the basics, you can develop your own combo's. A master elbow boxer doesn't need to throw a punch. Never mind a thousand kicks on the heavy bag, muay boran is real street fighting. Be careful with these techniques as you can really hurt somebody. By far the best $30 I have ever spent."
2,So bad it's good.,A really bad Hong Kong kung fun movie probably made for kids. So awful that it's a lot of fun. It's a comedy anyway.
5,Oregon Innertube,Purchased the Oregon 71-101 6-inch Tire Innertube 13X500-6 Bent Valve and had no problem installing the tube. On suggestion is to use soap suds on the tire to ease the installation on the wheel. Satisfied.
3,Good photos lacks context,"Agree with much of what a previous reviewed said, there is a lack of context although lots of pretty pictures."
4,"Good, but you could expect something more!","Difficult to make a movie for The DaVinci Code after the huge success of the book...Specially since Mr. Brown write in such a way that every reader was making their own movie in their mind... so is difficult to please each and everyone in the audience.I miss some more magic and details, but in general is a decent movie..."
4,The Davinci Code is a very interesting thriller.,"I've never read the Dan Brown Novel, but I really enjoyed the movie. I think critics are hating it due to the fact that the movie deals with a alternate history involing Christ, but the movie is dealt with in the style of a conventional thriller. And you would expect that from director Ron Howard. The first hour of the movie is really slow ( but still interesting), but it really gets good once Ian McKellan shows up. He makes the movie fun. I even like the fact that even when everything seems to be solved by the end of the movie, they throw in one more big suprise in the last three minutes. As I've said already I liked ""The Davinci Code""."
3,The Da Vinci Code,"The movie was okay, I think a prerequisite is to read Dan Brown's book in order to know who these characters are."
4,Much better than expected.,"Saw this movie one rainy afternoon because there was nothing else to do. All of the reviews I read rated it as terrible for one reason or another. But, I thought it was a pretty good adventure flick (circa Indiana Jones). Only negative for me was movie was too long...probably could have been cut down by 15-20 minutes without hurting the story line. I didn't read the book and don't know how well the movie followed the original story line. But, it was a fun way to spend a few hours."
3,Tom Hanks plays like Forrest Gump,"I gave the movie 3 stars. I could have given it 5 stars, but Tom Hanks was the wrong guy there. I could understand Ron Howard's respect for Tom Hanks, but he could have noticed the expression on Hanks' face while seated and listening to Teabing explain things to Sophie. He got that Forrest Gump look on his face! Tom Hanks playing a professor? NO!!! It could have been Johnny Depp or a much younger guy."
4,"Enjoyable movie, with nice premise!!","Didn't read the book, however I enjoyed watching this movie! Nice twist on the holy grail and Mary Magdeline's role in relation to Jesus.Great acting, nice screenplay and interesting storyline. Nice pace to the movie. Highly recommend."
1,Great Film but Glitchy DVD--Buyer Beware,"This a an excellent movie, intellignet, thought provoking, and very suspensful. The acting, direction, production are all top-notch. I also reccomend the novel! The only problem is that the DVD freezes at a crucial point in the story toward the end. I tried on two different DVD players and two different computers. Honestly, people pay good money for DVDs and deserve better. So--BUYER BEWARE--because this is either an encoding error or a bad pressing. If you expereince the same problem--return it and get your money back."
1,"Intriguing book, but beyond boring movie","This movie could have been a whole lot better, but reading the book is a prequisite for understanding and then explaining the movie to those who try to enjoy it on their own, if they don't first fall asleep from sheer boredom. Hollywood relativsm and mainstream Christianity aside, the film never quite captures the solving of intellectual riddles with any success; Cage's ""National Treasure"" and the TV series ""Numb3rs"" do a much better job. Unless you are an incurable insomniac with a penchant for self-flagellation like the monk, the wiser buy is the book."
3,Overhyped,"We saw The Da Vinci Code at an afternoon show on the first weekend--not a sellout--there was a lot of pre-opening hype, but not much in the way of actual protest at the theatre. I enjoyed the movie better than I thought I would based on the critical panning it took. However, it didn't add much if anything to what I got from the book. I thought that the considerable talents of Audrey Tatou were largely wasted as Sophie. Tom Hanks was OK as Langdon. Ian McKellen was a hoot as Teabing. All-in-all, an earnest adaptation, but nothing special--many film versions of very popular books have turned out the same way, and some films have been quite a bit worse (Bonfire of the Vanities, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, for example), so I guess that DaVinci Code was handled pretty well."
3,"How could you, Ron? Why?? WHY????","Everything that Mr. James Donovan states in his review is basically what I'd like to say. Overall, I just don't understand how Ron Howard messed this one up? How is it possible to mess this movie up at all? It would make sense if he did not read it. I believe he tried to put as much as he could into the movie. For example: the Aringarosa subplot. I'm sure many people had no clue what the point of it was. It was completely useless in the movie, and so was the sex ritual. The people who didn't read the book were probably thinking, ""What..the hell..is going on here...What are they doing.."" That's exactly what the guy beside me in the theatre said. Anyway, it's just so disappointing because the book had so much potential to be an excellent movie."
2,"Rent it, don't buy it.","A generally mediocre film. Follows the books fun (preposterous) theories fairly well, but really struggles to make them even marginally believable. The book is interesting and actually makes you want to do a little research. But I'm afraid the movie was merely a mishmash of a thriller/adventure that tries to seem important. Once you've seen it, I doubt you'll go back to it. Rent it first.P.S. according to my family tree, I'm no relation to Jesus. Unless the pope is lying."
4,International Adveture,This film kept me on the edge of my seat simply because it showed that something sobeeautiful as a painting could possibly conceal a message that would turn the worldon its head. To think that clandestine societies of supposedly honorable mencould conceal a secret so meaningful that it caused a murder. Tom Hanks brings tothe screen a truly believeable character who will not be deterred from discovering the truth.
4,Pleasant surprise,"A lot better than I expected. It has a feel to it like another famous one,National Treasure (Widescreen Edition). Tom Hanks carries the show with a treasure hunter's curiosity and made the plot intriguing. Overall, the movie has enough twists and turns that I never looked at my watch once. Good flick."
4,Plenty o' plot twists!,"I saw a preview of this movie last Saturday. My overall impression: the movie's a mashup of historical fact and fiction, used as a vehicle for a collection of 180 degree plot twists.What you come away with is something like ""Explain to me again what happened just before (plot twist N)"". Oh, and the scenery is just great. London and Paris are two of my favorite cities on earth, so it was nice to see backgrounds I know and love well.Ultimately it's kind of unsatisfying, but it's a thrill-a-minute movie to go through, with great scenery. See it once."
1,Just read the book and don't waste your money,"I've rarely seen a movie that was better than, nor even close to, as good as the book. And this is no exception. Many of the reviewers here have noted the discrepancies between the movie and Dan Brown's book, namely the overall lack of codes and investigation of Da Vinci. I loved the book, but hated the movie.Take the advice of the reviewers who have read the book, and don't waste your money. I promise you, if you liked the book, you'll leave this movie scratching your head and wondering why you did it."
3,Disappointment,"The Da Vinci Code was well written with all of the drama taking place within a twenty-four hour period. The characters in the book were strong and the art clues facinating. The movie failed and in my opinion did because of a ""flat"" acting job on the part of Tom Hanks. I have been a fan of Tom Hanks, as many people are, and had looked forward to seeing this movie. In fact, I had said that this was a vehicle where Tom Hanks could have had another stellar preformance. I was so mistaken and so disappointed.I did find the lighting and sets to be of interest. I thought the end of the movie was totally unnessecary and added little to the story line.All in all the rating of three is probably too high."
3,DaVinci Code DVD Wide Screen,"A reasonably good film adaptation of a complex novel. Probably hard to translate to film, and verbose in parts, but overall, keeps you entertained."
3,SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED,"THE MOVIE WAS RATHER CONFUSING, LENGTHY, AND FILMED TOO MUCH IN THE DARK. IT LACKED SUBSTANCE. THROUGH IT ALL I ABSOLUTELY LOVED TOM HANKS PERFORMANCE."
1,This is a horrible movie....,"Don't waste your money; if you really think you want to see this movie, RENT IT. It's really boring, Tom Hanks (usually one of my favorites) is miscast and adrift, the supporting cast is dull except for Ian McKellan, and the screenplay is plodding and dull. It's amazing that they could take such an entertaining yarn and turn it into such a sleep-inducing piece of junk! Great production values and a big-name director do not make a good movie. Sorry, Ron, you really blew it on this one. I hope no sequel is in the works in the future."
3,Slick glossy production of a mediocre story,"This movie was very well made, beautifully filmed, well acted, etc. The story was juvenile. Possibly infantile. As an example - Tom Hanks plays a cryptologist. Cryptology is a deep and fascinating subject, and the story could have explored that topic in interesting ways. Instead, when Tom Hanks encounters a message written on a floor, he exclaims (in amazement) ""It's an anagram!"". Oh come on, an ANAGRAM? Any 8-year-old child can handle that. Who needs a cryptologist?"
1,the item was never delivered,For the third time in a row this item was not delivered so the last 3 Christmasses my gift has not arrived.
3,Wait for the Extended Edition !,"This is what studios are doing when they know the movie was a hit.There will be an EXTENDED EDITION release coming out incorporating 26 minutes of deleted and extended scenes. It is now available in the region 3 release with a DTS 5.1 soundtrack and a second disc of features similar to the one found in the region 1 release. If you don't need a double dip, wait for this edition."
3,Decent movie with a totally flawed premise,"Interesting movie in some ways..but what is the whole point of hiding this secret of the ""grail"" ie. the bones of Mary M. because finding her would mean nothing..so what if somebody in the present that could be linked by DNA to her..THERE IS NO WAY TO PROVE WHO THE FATHER IS??!! I can't believe how the script could get approved with such a central major flaw???? And if they had the DNA of Jesus..anybody related to HIM would have been suffienct to prove he had a ""wife"". So again the Mary connection would not be that critical at all..only in that then one could prove which wife he had etc."
2,Could someone please rewrite the script and make a better movie?,"This is one of those rare cases where a movie should not have followed the book.The book itself was poorly written. The only reason it ""made it"" was because of its interesting premise, but in my view Dan Brown failed to deliver the goods. I could not even finish the book and decided to wait for a movie.From the first minutes of the movie it became clear that Ron Howard would be following the story, line by line which was bound to flop. I don't know exactly how the Hollywood screenwriting works but someone was suppose to put their foot down and insist on coming up with a better script. As a result of the ""follow the book"" concept, the movie turned out plain and disturbingly silly.What an interesting premise (I don't care if it's based on facts or not, this is after all the work of fiction anyway), that got the entire world shaken up and what a poor interpretation of it by both the book and the movie."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The DaVinci Code begins well enough, though the audience is asked to believe that upon being gutshot a character would use his own blood to leave cryptic clues for his pal Tom Hanks, but quickly gets bogged down in the endless machinations of the plot and ends up collapsing under its own weight--airtight this ain't."
2,"Good Mystery, but Not Good History -- & WHERE'S JOHN?","The Da Vinci Code is worth seeing as a mystery, period. There are LOTS of historical & religious errors -- but one in particular is so simple it should give pause to even the stupidest fan: WHERE IS JOHN????There are 13 figures in Da Vinci's ""The Last Supper"" painting. One is Christ. The others are the 12 Apostles; the one to Christ's left (though you'll note NOT NEAR him like a wife would be!) has always been identified as the Apostle John -- until the theory came along that it's really Mary Magdalene.Now, John was Christ's most loyal disciple. He would NOT have missed the dinner!!! SO IF THAT's MARY M., WHERE IS JOHN????????"
3,Half hearted Howard,"Sometimes you are constrained by your material. Howard, the master storyteller, does his best, but the thing is a bore."
1,Snore...,"This movie was horrid. Though only mildly more entertaining than the book. The conspiracy theories surrounding the idea of a Christ-bloodline are not new and they are at least illustrated (no pun intended) through a vaguely entertaining story. But this movie just missed the mark all together. Way too slow in trying to compile all of Brown's story into one movie. And for those of you who were distraught by the movie's changed ending from the book - are you serious? Did you really think that the book had a ""good"" ending? That sour drivel (which sounded like it was written by a horny 13yr old...) was charming and good?Don't waste your time or money on this movie. If it weren't for the ridiculious paycheck, I can only imagine Tom Hanks wished he'd done the same."
1,why is only christianity attacked like this?,"the answer is attacking the others might cost you your job or your head. it's a sad fact of human psychology that if you want respect you had better be threatening. apparently christianity's not very threatening these days. you can attack it with impunity. there's no down side. hollywood does it all the time. imagine the howls of outrage if the shoe was on the other foot. anyway, this movie itself is a boring treasure hunt who done it. laced with vicious anti-christian bigotry. another hollywood dog. what else is new."
3,The Da Vinci Code,"The DVC has the problem of creating its own paradox. If you have not read the book, there will be things that you won't understand. If you have read the book, the movie, like many movies, will not contain the true meat of details though it does supply a nice desert at a somewhat slow rate."
2,Couldn't Get Into It Or Finish It,"The whole of my review for this film is this: I thought the book was all right, looked forward to the movie, tried twice to watch it, and was not able to get through it because it was flat, dull, and uninteresting, with half-effort performances."
4,"Slick Movie, But Don't Take It Seriously","People on here need to get some perspective- this is NOT A DOCUMENTARY.This movie is meant to be for fun. I am not a conspiracy theorist, so you should use this movie to spark a discussion.And have fun! It's a quick paced flick, just like the book!"
4,Coff or Tea?^^ Tom Hanks <3,I think (I thnik I'm not aloe here) when I say that the book is better then the movie. But Tom Hanks (Bets actor in the world) does a grats job to play one of the best caracters ever written. Hi's versjon of Harword porfessor Robert Langdon is amazing. No one could hvae done a better job.The movie it self is also verry good. But I must edmit that I was not verry impressed when I saw it the first time. Much of the joy of reading the book was not in the movie. The intense joy was gone.But all in all a good movie. And some of the good liens from the book was in the movie! And that makes the movie alot better. ^^
1,Unrealistic and uninteresting,The main problem with this movie is that the story is not credible and too convoluted. This makes it difficult to follow and boring. I gave up after watching the first 20 minutes.
1,Read the book instead,"Dan Brown's brillant novel coming to life on the big screen is a prime example of Hollywood's unhesitating style to make money from a masterpiece. One of the many mistakes that sticks out with this film was the obvious rush taken to make the movie, and that's exactly what this film feels like as you watch it-rushed, leaving behind a trail of omissions from the actual novel that made the whole storyline intriguing and understandable. Even the conclusion of this film doesn't help matters as the character of Robert Langdon explains the mystery of the grail to Sophie, as if he's reading a script for an audio book rather than portraying a character attempting to solve a murder mystery. Audrey Tautou is pretty, but that's about it, and Tom Hanks, while a fine actor, is not who I pictured for the role and has never come off as more bland in his career. And that God-awful hairdo-where did they come up with that style?"
5,DaVinci Code,"This was a great movie, kept you on the edge of your seat all the way through. I would recomend this movie to everyone."
2,Not the best,This movie really killed the book. Very confusing and a lot of bad changes made. Not a good movie. The book was so much better. The book is five stars.
1,Disappointing,I read the book in two days and thought it was great -obviously I could hardly wait to see the movie -but then when I did it was more than disappointing -the story is obviously a difficult one to film and not only did the story seem wooden and constructed - even though there were good actors nobody was really convincing-and i did think that Audrey was terrible. All in all a disappointing experience
3,Better off reading the book,"This is the kinda story where you are much better off reading the book than watching the film. I dont mean that in the snobby sense of the guy who read the book who says its better than the film. I mean that this kinda story is one that you want to be engaged in. When you read the story you are sorta with the characters and the discoveries they make. When you watch the film its too detached. You are watching someone else go through the story rather than reading it and putting it together yourself along with the characters. Even if the film were better made it still would lose something because of this. Youd still be just the audience.If you havent read the book get the illustrated version. This way you can see what the characters are talking about, instead of having to just go along with it or do internet searches. The story pulls you in more that way because you can become more involved in the mysteryThe Da Vinci Code: Special Illustrated Edition: A Novel"
3,I don't get it,"I know what the premise of the movie is. However, I've never read the book and I've never seen the movie in the theater. Based solely on the DVD, I don't think the movie is ""all that"". I expected more and was disappointed."
3,Why Da vinci?,"I don't write a lot of reviews, but thought I would for this. After all the good stuff I heard I was very let down, but then I'd seen National Treasure, a film which does this type of thing far better. I'd been told this film would make me ask questions. It does. Why Da Vinci? With the exception of a few really tenuous James Burke-like connections there seems to be no association with Leonardo. There's certainly no Da Vinci code to speak of. Remember this is a review of the film, not the book, which I haven't read (I can't read) so take it as that. It's along the same lines as National Treasure, it's nowhere near as good. And one of the people in Da Vinci's Last Supper may have been female, does that mean she was Mary Magdalene and had kids with Jesus? Well James Burke had a successful cable show making even more tenuous connections than that. So there you go.......Owzat!"
1,Horrible if you're a fan of the Langdon series,"I was one of those people who read the book months before I ever heard it was becoming a movie. By the way, if you read Davinci Code, you got to read Angels and Demons. It puts Code to shame. I think Ron Howard and Hanks should have read it, too. Then, maybe they wouldn't have turned Robert Langdon into a whiney religion-supporting tool. Once Langdon met Teabing in the movie, I wanted to walk out. They completely changed the main character's personality!! I waited two hours in line with my equally anxious 6-month pregnant wife, and they completely ruined it. Silas was true to character, and probably the best part of the film. Aringarosa was different. Fachet took a complete 180 from the book. I understand cutting out parts from a book in order to make the movie flow, but changing the main characters was the dumbest move ever. I will never watch another Howard or Tom Hanks movie again. They dissapointed me that much."
3,Where's the extended cut for DVD???,"I know blu ray is the future but dvd still outsells it big time. I've been waiting since the original release for the extended cut of Da Vinci Code. PLEASE don't tell me you're only releasing it on blu ray. You are in the business of making money, aren't you?"
2,Wish I could say better...,"I saw this in the movie theaters....which I go to maybe once in five-ten years. Had heard it was not great, but since the book was, I went to the movie anyway. The movie gives me a headache, it is a lot of running around. I bought it on dvd to try to see if it was just my frame of mind when I first saw it. Literally, the characters run hither and yon chasing false/misinterpreted clues to some unknown destination. I have not seen Ms. Tatou before this, I think she is stunning. Ok, well, Tom's hair--I guess they wanted him to look like a New England academic liberal..I get that. Not a great choice in terms of flattering him, but Hanks is still a wonderful actor. I will watch this dvd again maybe to remind me how good the book was, but I have seen it twice now (movie and now dvd) and I still pretty much feel it is not a very good movie...feels almost like an amateur camerman with too many fast paced scenes/scenechanges without continuity of plot."
3,Average try at annihilating the myth of god,"I give Dan a five for trying. He might not have gotten it all right in the end but so what? It's not like the myth of Jesus holds up against sceptical attacks on it's genuinity, it's only a little too much conspiracy in Dans case. I don't know why people get all upset over Dans message, I doubt too many people living in civilized countries above the Ukraine take fairytales about people walking on water and raising from the dead very seriously. The problem is not the bashing of Dans research, the problem is that some folks seem to be of the conviction that if Dans book is proven not reliable, then the myth of Jesus and god is real! It would be like me saying; can you prove the green dragon on the back of saturn DOESN'T exist? Well there you go, shall we say a 50/50 chance of a dragon controlling our lives? Since I'm totally off topic and not helping you out in anyway I'll just call it quits right here. Thank you for your time."
4,Not as good as the book but still a very good movie!,"This movie was very well done considering the amount of information that had to be covered from the book. I read the book and loved it and although the movie could not exactly replicate the book, I found the movie to be very good. My wife did not read the book and also enjoyed the movie very much.The bonus features are great, especially the stuff about the real codes, mysteries and myths surrounding the story. As a historical fiction lover and a history lover, this dvd has a lot to offer.Good acting, good direction, decent screenplay and a great story."
3,Disappointing extras,"I am beginning to get fed up by all these collector's editions. There is always one annoying thing that you find out after having buying it. For this one, it is a game included in the second DVD that doesn't work UNLESS (and is is literally stated that way) you have bought the DVD online from the provider and not from a third-party like Amazon. You need a code to unlock the game and the only way to get it was to buy it online from the maker of the game. If not, you can just forget about it even though you have bought the DVD! Unless, you really want the Cryptex, buy another version instead and don't waste your money on this collector box."
3,not bad.. not good.. but not bad,Da vinci code couldn't quite live up to the publicity i guess.. not that it deserved any of it to begin with (goes to show how narrow-minded people are when they are so shocked by the slightest hint of change)..Yes it is an interesting thought that the church is sitting on top of some grandiose conspiracy - it probably is as a matter of fact (though i doubt it involves mary magdalene).. What we have here is something that is intriguing but it doesn't take us to that extra step - it isn't spellbinding (no where near in fact).. People say 'oh the book is so much better' - well I would certainly hope so.
3,ok,"Each time I play this movie on my dvd player I tell my self I will finish it all the way threw. I never do. It is an interesting movie. I like the story, but can't finish it all the way threw. I always find something else to do or fall asleep."
4,Film Review,"This had a good cast, but the film was much too long and it just didn't hold my interest. As usual for me, the book was much better."
4,movie too long,"This film was OK, but at least 30 minutes too long. We started to doze off in the middle of it."
5,The Da Vinci Code,"This movie is a crackling, fast-moving thriller. Something of a pleasant surprise. If you liked the book, you'll like this movie."
3,Why a different movie in the states than was released overseas?,"Can someone please explain to me why the movie released overseas was 35 minutes longer and contained the movie scenes that would have actually allowed the screen version to make as much sense as the book? I was so lucky to have seen the extended version, but was quite angry and frustrated to find that I cannot purchase it anywhere in the USA or on a disc that can actually be played on a DVD player from the United States. And people actually think we have freedom here in America. You are only kidding yourselves if you believe that."
5,"Very moving, thought provoking movie","The mastermind of Dan Brown comes alive in this adaption of the book by the same name. If you are a fan of Ron Howard movies, you won't be disappointed. There are a few deviations from the book, but they are as brilliant as the original story line. The music is also a highlight. Highly recommended."
2,a huge disappointment for those who read the book,"Perhaps the biggest problem with Dan Brown's adaptation of the bestselling, most controversial book in recent history is the fact that Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind, I, Robot) is undecisive as the scribe."
2,"Poor cheeze, pretentiously wrapped.Transfer ok ,no more","The Da Vinci Code is unimaginatively directed, the script is lifeless, and the performances are dull and uninspired; and it just goes on and on.It is the worse thing you can say about a movie;it is boring and disingenuous..Save your money.2 stars for the extras.The film is so dark it is hard to give the transfer a rating at all.It is also rapidly becoming one of the biggest money makers ever."
1,The Da Vinci Code,Anything less than this movie sucks would do a disservice to the term.Unbelievably poor acting. Hanks just walked through the part as did everyone else including Jean Reno who should have been flamboyant with this part. It is really no ones fault but the director. I'm sorry Opie (Ron Howard) but you should have went fishing with Barney instead of directing this one. I trust that Angels and Deamons will have a better director otherwise another incredible story will go up in celluloid smoke.
1,YAWN!,It's a complete bore! A waste of good two hours. I just wanted to go home and watch one of my favorite movies than watching this crap. Wait till it comes on DVD. Do not see it in cinema. I never read the book so I can't really compare the book to the movie but the movie itself sucks. Don't waste your money!
3,Could it have been better?,"Sure, it could have been. But its a huge undertaking to create a 2 hour visual presentation of a book that was heavy on conversation and discussions of dense, arcane topics. Consider the enormous undertaking, I think they did an admirable job. I actually give it 3 and a half stars.On the plus side, much of the photography is stunning and both hanks and McClellen deliver their usual great performances. But the main reason I'll be buying this dvd is because it will piss off all the people who need to be pissed off. You know who they are. The wingnuts who were screaming that the book and film are blasphemy, attacking Catholicism, insulting to the official propaganda, I mean King James version of the Bible. blah blah blah whine whine whine. If these people have nothing better to do than throw a hissy fit over a piece of historical fiction (The Da Vinci Hoax) then I suppose I should do my part to help provide them with the outrage they seem to get off on."
2,The Wrong People Making this Film,"Let me start off by saying how much I enjoyed the book.My doubts regarding Ron Howard as director were justified: He is too ""Americana"" for this material. I think David Fincher would have done a better job.Tom Hanks was adequate but I would have preferred Kurt Russell or Jeff Bridges in the role. Everyone else was perfectly cast.I recommend the book. And if I never saw the film again, that would be fine with me."
1,Couldn't finish watching,"Widescreen version played on a wide screen, we lost half the subtitles. Half the dialogue is in French, Italian, or Latin, with subtitles. Most of the subtitles did not display on our widescreen TV (played on a conventional TV with letterbox would have been OK). Also, movie started with nearly 2 minutes of cutesy CGI logos from several companies - very boring and distracting. Maybe one of those companies could have put the subtitles high enough to read on a widescreen TV! While the film itself might have been OK, we couldn't watch after 20 minutes because we couldn't tell what was going on - my wife's high school French is rusty, and neither one of us understood Italian. We didn't realize this was produced as a foreign film..."
3,Okay if seen as fiction,"If you see this as a fictional tale, then this is entertaining. But if you look it at a historical or factual guide, don't bother."
1,This is what it boils down to for me.........,".....""high speed"" chase through Paris is a Smart car.Not exactly Ronin, is it?I actually wanted to like this as I really like Tom Hanks but, dear oh dear, Tom. I just can't bring myself to give it anything above 1 star. Over hyped rubbish."
3,Really- REALLY not that big of a movie. Very overhyped.,If it wasn't for the Church getting it's knickers all up in a bunch- this movie would have gone very quietly in and out of the theaters. I wouldn't really bother to own the DVD (after seeing it) and a Deluxe Collector's Edition is REALLY pushing it. If you read the book- you deserve so much more from this movie. If you didn't- you really won't understand what all the fuss was about. The book was amazing and it spend chapters after chapters validating the research and clue gathering that lead to the stories credibility. In the movie- it's like everything is figured out and solved in a weekend and it makes you think 'and why couldn't anybody have figured out this mystery??!!' so it really looses it's WOW factor. I was very unimpressed with the compression of the story when it came to the movie. Do yourself a favor- read the book (or listen to an audio book) and you'll get 10x the enjoyment out of this than watching this movie.
5,It's just a movie folks!! And a GREAT one at that!!,"I read the book and saw the movie twice. I can't wait to get my DVD. The movie was a great ride with all of the twists,turns and excitement of the book. I absolutely LOVED Tom Hanks as Langdon, he did an awesome job!!!"
1,More fantastic than National Treasure,If Mary Magdalene was the holy grail and wife of Jesus Christ...then I must be the Easter bunny!
3,"Don't buy the Giftset, movie is good","I got this as a gift and it's not worth the extra money. The movie is good, but the cryptex is only cool a short time."
4,It was fun,"Since this movie cut many of redundancy of original story, it is confortable to watch for 2 hours. But the parts to get answers of puzzles were very simple and smooth. Usual human thinks much longer han that if he gets a few clues."
4,Tom Hanks misplaced,"I had already read the book, so knew what to expect. I love Tom Hanks but felt he was mis-placed in this roll. The story was interesting, but moved too fast to understand all that the book offered."
2,Incompetent Service,"I ordered this moviea few months ago, and while it came quite quick;y, I received the wrong version of the film I ordered. Instead of sending it back and waiting anymoreI decided to keep it. I was not very happy with the way this service works, and will probably not order form here again."
2,Only good if you've read the book,"I would have had no idea what was going on in this movie had I not read the book first! It follows the story of the book fairly well, but it doesn't develop any characters, basically assuming that you know who these people are and their backgrounds.Overall though, it was a good movie, but I thought the chemistry between Tom Hanks and the leading lady was quite bad. You just didn't feel anything between the two of them.Would recommend reading the book!"
2,What is the big deal?,"Ok. I did not read the book before I watched this, and I cannot claim to know a lot about history, certainly not as it pertains to Leonardo Da Vinci. I am aware of the masterpieces he created, and I am aware of the myths about the priory of scion (sp?). But, for all the hoopla I heard about this movie, I must say I was bitterly disappointed when I rented it recently. I had to fight to remain awake for the most part because it was so slow and, frankly, boring. Is it me, or has the American movie audiences' concept of ""entertainment"" sunken to this kind of low?"
2,Ridiculously juvenile,"Boy howdy did the masses gobble this one up! Tom Hanks is one of THEE finest actors of our time, but he could not even save it. He plays Robert Langdon, a guy with a fictional degree in cryptology who can suddenly turn into a super athletic hero type when called upon. Jesus had a cousin whose sister had a nephew who married a truck driver that had another boy whose daughter married a guy a while back and now they live in Memphis. In the meantime of course, it is all laid out in a painting until they find this Rubiks cube device that would make the people at Monopoly laugh. Tom Hanks with long hair is lame as well, so beware of long haired crypto guys that suddenly can dodge bullets!"
3,not as good as the book,worth watching a a a a a a a a a a a a part of their responsibility it's not
2,Really disappointed,"Very good acting by Hanks but otherwise a disappointment.150 minutes of trying to follow the actors cracking cryptic codes, which could have been intriguing, but in this setting it's not. There is very little to make it interesting.It was filmed in Paris but instead of having footage of Paris as a backdrop, pictures of the city and its attractions are almost nil.Instead it is primarily watching the characters in brown and grey cubbyholes and listening to them talk a mile a minute.I suggest at least get up and take a break after the first hour and a half because there is still a long way to go."
3,"Similar to ""National Treasure""","""The Da Vinci Code"" is similar to ""National Treasure"" but it is slower paced and less exciting. Still, it has an interesting story and it's fairly well made. I think it would be better if it were much shorter. Also, it has numerous picturesque settings, such as Paris, but the cinematography does not bring out the best of these locations. The Blu-ray transfer is okay but disappointingly flat and fuzzy for hi-def. There was only one scene that looked really sharp and textured to me. Reviewed 4/30/2009 after watching on Blu-ray."
3,Don't read the book first...,"I had seen this movie years ago, when it was first released. Recently, I became a fan of Audile.com. I purchased this book and listened; as with most books/movies, the book was far better. However, I was very interested in seeing this movie again after finishing the book...the pace wasn't right and the acting (and I'm a huge Tom Hanks fan) was dull.If you don't read the book first, you'll probably really enjoy the movie - for it's entertainment value. If you read the book first, you'll be disappointed."
3,"it's slow moving,, and the intrigue is contrived.","In some ways it is current, with the archeological discovery recently, which seems to verify that Mary was more than a follower of Christ, but the rest of the plot ois contrived."
4,Good movie,Even though it is a classic movie I really enjoy see in it over and over again. I really got it for a good price
3,Not much of a thriller,"When it comes to faith, facts are irrelevant. I had this thought as I was watching this movie. Let say that one accepts all the premises of this movie (and Dan Brown's book), that the descendant of Jesus Christ is walking among us, and that some secret religious organizations, the Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion, are battling each other over the secret; the outcome of the conflict would hardly make any difference in the course of humanity. People who believed in the divinity of Jesus before will still do so, and those who didn't will still snicker about the idea. No amount of facts will ever change that. The stake is so small that it takes the thrill out of this thriller. Nevertheless, I must say that this is a well-crafted movie, with excellent actors and actresses. It is just that the story doesn't work for me."
3,Never captured the spirit of the book,"I absolutely loved the book but was truly disappointed when I saw the movie. Unfortunately I felt the movie never captured the spirit of the book. When reading the book I couldn't put the book down cause I wanted to know what happened next. When watching the movie I caught myself a couple of times checking the time wondering when the movie was going to end. I even gave the movie a couple of chances but still in my mind it never lived up to the book.Dan Brown is a fantastic author and I enjoyed reading his entire catalog. I have heard that ""Angels & Demons"" is currently into production and I hope that it turns out better then The Da Vinci Code.If you are a fan of the book then you should give the movie a chance. I just felt after watching the movie that they could of done so much more."
5,Hanks does it again..,"Certain actors just captivate the screen while portraying a character and just memorizes and invites you to be a part of the scenes. Touching a subject that has only ever been hinted at, this movie presents a thought provoking way of exploring a subject that has stayed hidden among the masses. Be sure to grab a copy of this awesome movie and prepare to enjoy, examine, and question a theme that was right in front of your eyes."
5,Only for the intelligent viewer,"Ron Howard should get an Academy Award for this one. History, intrigue, murder. A real ""thinker"" film. This is not light viewing folks but is a wonderful movie for those who love to think !"
2,Ugh...this one is just bad!,"Wow, what a disappointment. Great actors with a god-awful script from a fantastic book. I loved the book so much, I just couldn't wait to see the movie and I missed it theaters so I watched it this weekend from Netflix. What can I say? It's BORING! I'm not a huge fan of Tom Hanks, especially with this mullet-esque hair (it's ok to hate me), but I love Iam McCellan and Jean Reno, but these great actors just couldn't save this movie. And Sofie Neveau was SO much more interesting in the book. Don't waste your time on this one."
3,Overrated in Every Sense.,"I have to admit that I'm not somebody who's going to be real receptive to this story line, but, even so, this film was a disappointment. With movies, when one disagrees with a premise it is still possible to suspend disbelief and enjoy them, but it was tough to do that here and it was largely a result of superficial reasons. That's not to say it's a bad film though because it isn't. The Da Vinci Code is passable entertainment wise, but, given the hype, I can't say much more of a positive nature than that. What we have here is a fairly low intensity effort by all concerned. The acting was uninspired and this may be the first time in which I ever recall Tom Hanks being unimpressive in a film. I guess I'm going to have to check out the book itself as so many reviewers found it far superior to the visual depiction."
5,davinci code,i love the mystery of this movie it has suspense adventure test your knowledge of you teachings & a chase to uncover a secret
4,"Yes the book is better, you know that","We all say that and it is usually true. In this case it is really is, like all the other times we say it. Other people tell you this so I will too. The book is so exciting! If you got nothing else to rent then this is your film."
3,Da Vinci Code,"This movie was pretty disappointing seeing it was directed by Ron Howard and starred Tom Hanks. It just didn't really get going. I have read the book and it was much better, sometimes good books don't necessarily translate into great movies. I am a great fan of Ron Howard, Appollo 13 and Missing were spectacular."
5,"It is a great movie, and true to the book","I read a lot of complaints from reviewers that this movie did not provide the excitement the book provided. I don't agree. All of the action in the book is also in the movie. The characters, spirit and content are spot on. I didn't feel anything was missing, really. 'Really' means that of course some of the back story stuff - where the main characters digress and provide background to what is going on - a concept, an event, etc. is necessarily missing because film does not handle that as well as print media does. Nevertheless, it does do an admirable job with necessary back story stuff (who were the Knights Templar, etc). It is the writing style of Dan Brown the provided the rollar-coaster ride that everyone misses who wanted thrills and not content in this film. Writing style really cannot be duplicated so easily in film."
2,Constantly in a rush,"The book is much better than the film, but looking at the numbers of people that went to see it, nobody seemed to care. As the intelligent plot needed to be squeezed into a normal length movie, the story is constantly in a rush. Perhaps some kind of series would have been a better idea..Anyway all other details, like actors and pictures looks well in order. It's almost impossible to accept Tom Hanks as a professor though. Couldn't they find someone else for that part? With the exception of Saving Private Ryan and Road to perdition that guy has been playing nitwits all his life. (SARR)"
4,Could be improved upon..,"I like the giftset a lot and it was what i expected, but it should have more options than it does. Its only in widescreen format, when it should have an option to view in widescreen or fullframe."
3,The Da Vinci Code,Good acting but the screenplay was shot. Too many things were changed for my liking. Editing was also a little rough at times. A C+ film
2,Mostly a waste of time.,"I never read the book, so had very sketchy knowledge, but great expectations. Now I have knowledge and those expectations were UNFULFILLED. The film was well done, but WHY DO IT? I am very anti-organized religion so the knocks on the church (with RC's subbing, in my mind, at least, for all OR) resonated. But such silliness. And there was little of the suspense that the makers seemed so proud of: I KNEW after about 10 minutes that THAT character was THAT CHARACTER!!!! Tom Hanks was good in his typical fashion; Ian McKellen was awfully silly; the girl OK. But I was terribly disappointed. That this was at or near the top of best-seller lists for two years+ says much too much about the vapidity of American taste. But then we've gota smirking chimp for president....."
5,Nice Extras,"I purchased this for the cryptex which was in the box. It was exactly what I expected (a modified bike lock). The movie -- well pass your own judgement on it, I enjoyed it and found it entertaining and not at all heretical like some say."
2,ugh Tom Hanks...,"Anybody who has read the book knows that Tom Hanks is NOT in no way Robert Langdon. No. Way. When I first heard that I thought it was a joke, but unfortunetly, it was the awful truth. And he did ruin the movie for me. That and the fact that they butchered the beautiful novel. It was barely recognizable. What's even worse is that they are making 'Angels and Demons' and still keeping Tom Hanks. Another disaster waiting to happen."
3,Cast Away this one,"After hearing and reading all the fuss about this movie, I finally got to see it. Seems the fuss was about the subject matter and not the movie. Tom Hanks gave a mediocre performance at best, taking a back seat to the story I guess. The dots were connected too quickly and easily.The movie was entertaining, but that was mostly because of the strong performances of Ian McKellen and Jean Reno.I'm not much for conspiracy theories,so I'm sure I'll get blasted for my review but I have seen better told stories (regardless of the subject).For some of Tom Hanks best see Cast Away. For some outstanding story telling see Strangers on a Train.This movie makes for good Cable Fodder, but isn't one that will stand the test of time."
3,mixed feelings,"I had mixed feelings after watching this movie. One of course has to consider that the movie was competing with a extremelly successful book that everyone (despite if someone like it or not) had read it or had knowledge of it. Thus the director, the script writer and the actors had a mountain to climb.The script deviates from the book in several aspects and pays little attention to the thinking of the players on solving the puzzle- although any film would compete rather poorly with a book in this aspect. Having said that Ron Howard directed this film very well but I think that Tom Hanks was miscast for the leading role. He is a great actor but he is not really the professor that Dan Brown described. The rest of the cast perfomed quite well.All in all if you watch this movie without attempting to compare it to the book you could actually enjoy it."
4,The Da Vinci Code review by SL.,"It is a good and exiting movie, not many surprices.It is a different kind of movie then what we are used to at these times, so it is a great refreshment.In this move there are a religious aspects, but no mather if you are religous or not you will still like this movie."
3,"Some miscasting, but a pleasantly diverting film.","Of course, one couldn't help but have very low expectations for The Da Vinci Code. Critics have been unmerciful. Ron Howard was an odd pick for director. Tom Hanks? He lacks sufficient gravitas (and in my book, acting ability, for the lead). And can anyone understand all of what Audrey Tautou says under that thick, albeit authentic, accent?And yet, despite Ron Howard's penchant for the obvious and mundane, and Hanks' very low-key performance, The Da Vinci Code draws you in. It's entertaining. It isn't (thankfully) half as expository as it could have been. (Hanks seemed so strikingly unphysical and, moreso, unmasculine, that I started thinking he might be ill -- and trying to hide it. He seemed slow and bloated, and simply not up to the task.)The book was pretty good, and so is the movie."
4,Suberb!,"The length is a little punishing (said the Nun to the Bishop), but I thought this was rollicking good fun for the most part. UK viewers may titter when Audrey Tautou first appears talking like Michelle from vintage BBC comedy 'Allo 'Allo (""Listen very carefully; I shall say this only once!"") and even wearing the same coat. Director Ron Howard's approach - hokey melodrama but on a tight leash - works surprisingly well.I am not religious but I was very touched by its sentiments."
3,Loved the Book! The movie...not so much,"I read The Da Vinci Code and could not put the book down and the awesome thing was that I was reading it while studying abroad in France and it added to the mystery. I then watched the movie and was really disappointed. I hated how they cut out the library scene and had them search for Alexander Pope on a bus, using a stranger's phone to access the internet. Huh? I did like the albino, though. His performance was probably the best. To get the full effect of what Dan Brown CREATED, read the book, please!. If you just watch the movie, you will miss the wonder and creative work of Dan Brown. The movie did the book little, if any, justice."
4,Da Vinci Code ... makes you wonder,"Having read the book before seeing the movie , i think i was able to follow the story line alot better .. i think if you watch it cold, you might have a hard time following the plot. Personally i love this type of thriller ... where you are given clues and it intertwines real history with fiction. Brings to your attention alot of quirky little things that you otherwise might not ever be aware of, all in all a great film ...to be watched numerous times to pick up all the subtle nuances. I highly recommend it :)"
3,"As usual, the film falls short of the book","The book version of the Da Vinci Code is one of my favorite books of all time. But as is the case with most film, it falls short of Dan Brown's verion of the story. They had to trim a lot of fat to get this story into film version. The supporting cast of Silas, Fache, and Aringarosa was phenomenal. But Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou both give a dry and stiff performance. I also imagine that if you haven't read the book before that the film will be very hard to follow for a while. A good film in some respects, but read the book, you'll be much happier."
1,Duller than the book if that is possible.,Just as the book was reading for non-readers this is viewing for non-movie goers. Rubbish.
1,HUGELY OVER RATED,"THIS MOVIE WAS BORING AS HELL AND HUGELY OVER RATED, TOM HANKS IS FLAT, AS IF HE EVER WAS THAT GREAT AN ACTOR WHEN NOT RETARDED, AND THE SUSPENSE IS NEVER FELT. IT A TRYING BORING BARF DEISGNED TO GET YOUR CASH AND HAVE LITTLE MYSTERY. I HATE WHO EVER MADE IT."
3,A DISSAPOINTMENT,"Not a total disaster, but doesn't measure up to the book. mckellen, as everyone has already commented on, was wonderful. the movie seemed bland and dull without him. what made the book such a page turner was the fun and excitement in following the clues. they are for the most part, missing in the movie. maybe ""the da vinci code"" could have been made in two parts, obviously it's difficult to include everything in a two hour plus movie. unfortunately the lack of drama and intensity, found so often in dan brown's great novel, were, sad to say, not there. ""the da vinci code"" has it's moments, and I'm a hanks and howard fan, but it was an almost impossible task to bring this novel to the screen. as far as the controversy is concerned, I believe ""the da vinci code"" is a work of fiction, and should be regarded as fiction. I don't really understand all the uproar. my problems with the movie have nothing to do with the controversy surrounding it."
3,"Direction so so, cast very good","(with the exception of McKellen as Teabing - maybe cuz that is not how I imagined him when I saw the book ""play"" in my head while reading it).Hanks also kinda eeee. Not really inspired.As for movie itself - flashbacks into history nicely incorporated, action in present so much slower than the book, the real reason for enstrangement between Sauniere and Sophie not REALLY explained (while crucial to the story of the sacred feminine), meaning of Sophie's name not explained (also important for the whole premise of the book).Too long in length, too little content, too lil action (compared to book).When the movie played in your head while reading the book outshines the Hollywood production, result is disappoinment. So with this film."
1,A Snoozer,"Oh, I am so disappointed--in Ron Howard, Tom Hanks, and Audrey Tautou. The adaptation of book to screen had such possibilities! Unfortunately, it ends up as an ""action"" film without the subtle substance of the book. If the viewer had not read the book first, I'm not sure they would have a clue what was going on in the film. For those of us who read the book, there is disappointment in the efforts to push everything into 149 minutes. It doesn't work.Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors but he is like a cardboard cutout here. There are no emotions. As one reviewer reflected, Hanks seemed consummately bored with the whole endeavor. The character gave nothing to the audience to hold on to. The same is true for Audrey Tautou and her character. There was no chemistry between the two; the viewer has a difficult time empathizing with the characters, or engaging in the adventure with them. So, read the book and save your popcorn for a different film. This one is a big disappointment all around."
3,"A fine and entertaining summer movie (but it,s ain,t perfect)","It is not a masterpiece like Ron Howard,s (COCOON and APOLLO13) or a piece of art and perfection like Da Vinci,s(THE MONALISA and MADDONA OF THE ROCKS).It,s just another summer hit(you can compare it to NATIONAL TREASURE) thanks to Dan Brown,s highly acclaimed and well knoun novel(masterpiece).This movie was very very faithful to the book and to the charecters on it.It is Filled with great puzzel (code) solvings and eye popping locations.Mackellen and specially Bettany done great and gave their charecters the right treatment.Read the book and then watch this one like myself to live this entertaining experience (ride)."
1,beyond awful,"I can safely say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. When the book first came out I tried to get through it without much sucess. Silly me, I actually thought movie might be more interesting to watch. After first half hour all my hopes were cruly destroyed. I felt myself drifting somewhere far away where there was no Tom Hanks with weird haircut and a sex appeal of a garbage man, and no long monologues about yet another ""conspiracy"" within Catholic Church.(why is that we never hear about any conspiracies among Protestants, or Lutherans? Gee, I guess that doesn't sound quite as good. When I glanced over at my husband, he was actually asleep. I let him sleep for another 20 minutes before I gave up and we left in the middle of Tom Hank's getaway that was about as exciting to watch as watching grass grow and wondered how can anybody have the patience to sit through 2.5 hours of this torture?"
1,This movie was a complete disappointment!,"This movie was a complete disappointment. One needs to read a book to understand what is going on. Also, the whole movie is done in a dark setting: almost impossible to see faces and action. The book is too complex for the movie."
2,Good movie Bad Disc,"The movie is great, but the qaulity of the disc is terrible!! I must have been damaged with the previous owner! It skips to the end every ten minutes!"
3,Gift for him,"Purchased this DVD for my niece's mate and I think he watched it once. Not a very thrilling movie. Loved the hype, but movie is a yawn."
1,disappointing Hanks flick,Due to all the hype surrounding this film I had high expectations. I felt this movie was rather boring the worst being the ending that just felt unfinished to me. The fact that this also suggests lies concerning Christ doesn't help it either.
2,Overly Complicated and Fast-Moving Plot,"""The Da Vinci Code"" is complex and moves at about a mile a minute - the result is about as plausible as Bush sponsoring tax hikes for the rich, bringing peace to the Mid-East, and finding a way out of Iraq. If only I could solve problems 24-hours/day at one-tenth the speed of Tom Hanks, etc."
1,"Please don't judge me, I didn't want to see it","Dear me. After studiously avoiding the pseudo-literary claptrap that is Dan Brown's sacriledge-in-print, wouldn't you just know it? My ""women's group"" dragged me to see it. I knew I shouldn't have joined that group, I basically got conned into it (but that's another story). I will admit to having taken frequent toilet breaks (even when I didn't have to go) in order to miss more of the movie. Folks, I even tried to doze off but this annoying group member, Joyce, kept smacking her gum too loudly.Tom Hanks has let me down, especially after a movie liked ""Road To Perdition"" which was wondrous. Ron Howard, well, I always regarded him as a flyweight filmmaker - and this time out, he's underweight even for that class. This movie is detestable and I don't want to ""spoil"" it for anyone who actually cares, so I won't elaborate on plot details. The movie was long, slow, and boring. It also is highly insulting to Christains like I proudly count myself as. Piece."
1,Is the bible.,The da vinci code is not only a pathetic book but a pathetic movie as well. If atheists don't believe in God or Christ in anyway then why are they so set against making him banned everywhere. I mean he doesn't exist so why are they taking all their time to get rid of someone who isn't real in anyway. Why does he hold such a threat if hes just a sigma of are imaginations think about it. Assuming that anybody who watched this movie can think.
1,THIS AM A BAD MOOVEY!!!,"I EM NOT GUNNA SEE THIS BAD BAD MOVIE CUZ ITZ MAYDE BY THE DEVIL seriussly you peepule are all wicked and evel. Saten must come to talk thru your dog to you and tell you whut to do, this moovey am rilly rilly RILLY bad!p.s. George Bush Rules!"
1,Where's the regular DVD?,"This review is specific to the Blu-ray Extended Cut release.WHERE IS MY REGULAR DVD?Why do people think that BLu-ray is the way to go? It's pixels, just pixels.The bonus feature that are specific to Blu-ray are ridiculous, easily put on a regular DVD.That being said, why is it necessary to release an extended cut of Da Vinci Code only on Blu-ray? Why are they forcing people to pay for pixels?I don't know about you but this kind of shenanigans is only going to increase the piracy problem. People, like me, don't want to pay for pixels. In fact, having seen Transformers in BR, I can tell just how FAKE a movie actually is. So why are studios supporting this move?I don't pay for pixels and neither should you. Keep the grain in your movies, it makes the movies more realistic.And I'll just buy the international version of the extended cut on regular DVD."
5,Da Vinci Code Movie,The movie is great. Some critics complained that it followed the book too much - that's a good thing!
2,"While I don't regret watching it, I can't recommend it","I'd say the movie was about as good as the book - which is basically fluff. The characters lacked depth, and the story was weak at best. I don't regret watching it, but I would also never want to see it again. If you have anything else to do, you're better off doing it instead of spending the time with this movie."
4,Better than You Might Think,"The DaVinci Code deserved better reviews than it received from the critics. Ron Howard did a good job of condensing a very long and complex plot into a comprehensible movie of reasonable length. Tom Hanks does an excellent job of portraying the American symbologist who is suspected of murder, and Audrey Tatou is an excellent counterpart to Hanks. I didn't even mind Tom's hair--it seemed appropriate for his character. My husband, who had not read the book, had no problems following the plot, whereas I, who have read the book, am impressed that they managed to get as much of the book in there as they did. Forget the controversy about the book; don't even think of the idea that the main premise might be true, and concentrate on enjoying the movie."
1,Boring from 15-th minute to the end of movie,"Horribly boring movie, that was an object of many critics'. Really have no idea why people was so crazy about this movie, because scenario, acting and everything at all is absolute zero.I know that when was a premiere of movie is Russia, many people - critics and most of them famous singers, actors come to watch it. All main cinema of Moscow was full of people, but in 30 minutes people begin to leave cinema and to end of movie stayed maximum half of hall.I tried to watch this movie, to find it interesting and first 15 minutes even promised that rest of movie have to be exiting. But to the end of movie i was almost sleeping. Last 15 minutes i even didn't saw - couldn't stand it anymore. BORING! And even Tom Hanks didn't manages to save this film. One of the worse movie's of 2006."
4,All Controversy Aside An Exciting Thriller,"I read the book before I saw the movie. I am a committed, and devout catholic Christian also, but I never read the book or saw the movie as anything more than exciting fiction...I think all the bashing and alarmismfrom the religious right was ""overblown by the media and many in the Christian community who gladly mined the book and movie themselves for profits...(witness all the ""anti-DaVinci"" books, movies and audio tapes.)If you are SECURE in your faith the book and film should not affect you.It didn't for me...it actually led me to read more of the Bible and the patristic fathers of the Church.As for the film, well, the book was probably one of the ""best"" I've ever read. I expected to be disappointed by the movie, but ""was not"".I thought Tom Hanks and the Cast were GREAT. Don't miss it! Unless of course, you feel it is offensive...As thinking adults we can and should all decide that for ourselves. Atreides"
3,I didn't read the book,"No, I didn't read the book, and so I viewed the DVD without prejudice. I'm not a particular fan of Hanks either, and I really couldn't say why. In any case I'm neutral. However, The Da Vinci Code kept me interested from beginning to end. Hanks, had me convinced he was Robert Langdon, and although Ms. Tautau's part as Sofie Neveu, a cryptologist, wasn't quite so demanding she brought her character to life. Her acting was superb as was all of the cast. The story was interesting, believable, and intense from the very beginning building ever so slightly as the movie progressed, and the ending was not a let down. Three and a half stars, and well worth the time invested in viewing."
5,Great Entertainment,"Despite some of the other reviews to the contrary, I have not read the book but found the movie very entertaining. So any mention that someone who is not familiar with the book will be lost is ridiculous. I am a great fan of Hitchcock movies and believe he would have made this movie if he were alive today. All of the acting, directing, writing for the film are 1st rate. The book is fiction, the movie is fiction--just enjoy them both for what they are!"
3,"No Masterpiece, But Worth Seeing","It's readily agreed that director Ron Howard's uneven adaptation of the Dan Brown best-seller will not win any major awards. When considering the expository nature of the source material, it's amazing that ""The Da Vinci Code"" came off as well as it did. Though overlong and rather talky in spots, Howard has crafted a diverting mystery-thriller that benefits immeasurably from Sir Ian McKellan's bravura performance. Audrey Tautou is the ideal Sophie, but Tom Hanks cannot overcome his miscasting as Professor Robert Langdon. Still, it's a brave attempt."
4,Just a good movie.,"Not a religious manifesto, or underhanded attempt to undermine conventional religion. There were several handfuls of protestors outside the theater tonight, of a fundamentalist religious persuation. The placards all implied that the movie damaged the faith of the country in some way.Had the urge to to remind them that this was and is a work of fiction. I guess they know that. I did.Taken as such, the movie was quite good. The performances are not going to win anyone Oscars but the three hours were over almost before I knew it. The premise was entertaining and the movie well done.I'll be very interested to see what kind of extras will be in the DVD version(s)."
4,Better than the Theatre Version,The extended version (Directors Cut) is better than the extended version of this film. As usual. I recommend this film. :-)
5,"I got this for the ""Cryptex""","I saw the Cryptex on Reddit and knew I had to have it. Individually the Cryptex can be purchased here on Amazon from $60.00 to $200.00 so this Da Vinci Code Gift set is an excellent deal. The Cryptex is cool. Well made. Heavy and can hold a 3 dram vial of your favorite illegal substance. Buy this, save a ton of money and give the movie to Goodwill."
4,Not the book but still pretty good,"I went into this without any expectations because I have never seen ANY movie stay totally true to the book its based on. This one was pretty close. The acting was very good, the background was very impressive but still it seemed slower than the book. How can that be? It is a long movie and honestly it took me three nights to watch it. Is that because I have three young kids and I am always beat, or is it because it just moves a little too slow. But still how could reading a book be faster and more engaging than a big budget action flick.Oh yeah, I totally ignored all the hype from the church on this. Its a movie or a book. Fictional book/movie. Get over it.Bottom line - its better than most movies I have seen in the last 12-18 months, but it is slow and may require some extra caffine to get through."
3,This item is defective,"This product was delivered faster than expected, quality is what I wanted but it is defective. One of the screws that hold the tubes so that it can be adjusted up or down is not working."
4,Sturdy and steady,"very good quality-- basic cymbal stand, but very sturdy and adjustable hardware seems sufficient; time will tell but looks good so far. FYI I rarely give 5 stars for anything-- never seen perfection in my >50 yrs on this earth and don't trust seeing it so often in online ratings."
2,Priced Right,"I was expecting too much for my money. One of the tubes was dented, finish pretty bad. I'm glad I only bought it for a practice kit."
4,Great pant!!!,"I purchased these for running in colder weather. I'm sorry, but I just can't bring myself to run those tight things and putting running shorts on over them looks even dorkier. These pants work great! They breathe well, but block the wind. They're also extremely comfortable if all you're looking for is a pair of warm-up pants..."
4,More Bryson City Stories,"This is a delightful mixture of tales by a young doctor living in the south. I love this family. Some stories are funny, some are almost frightening. The overall theme of the book is that of survival. I enjoyed it a lot!"
3,Disappointing,Although I have great respect for Dr. Larimore I was disappointed with the book. There were too many details about the people he wrote about and too many quoted conversations for my liking.
4,Sad ending,"Good book, but a sad sequel to the trilogy. Not written with the same joy as the other two, and for very good reason. Still recommended. Excellent author."
5,It only makes sense,"Look, you can buy Mark Musa's translation of Inferno and notes from PenguinThe Divine Comedy: Volume 1: Inferno (Penguin Classics)and that's all you get. Or you can buy this book, get the same translation and notes with a festschrift (a collection of scholarly essays written to honor Musa (Musa even offers one himself)). I think that's worth the extra three bucks plus its a handsomer book. Plus, Musa blank verse is very good. While you're at it, you could also look at my bookDante's Journey: A Field Guide to the Infernal Regions"
5,Turn Up The Volume,I stumbled across this cd today and have fallen in love with it. Truly a great cd to turn up the volume and hang on for the ride. Wish I could have been at the Jazz Bakery with the previous reviewer - I heard Milt was smiling the entire time.
4,California Champions!,"Featuring amateur poker players in events with prize pools in excess of $100,000, The Southern California Poker Tour was the first television program of its kind, Complete with overhead and ""hole-card"" cams. Wild poker action!"
2,WTF happened to my band,I love theese guys but this album is depressing. Ya ok FTTW was kind of a decent from the awesome lyrics and faced paced rifs in thickier than watter and H2O but this CD plain sucks. The lyrics are mediocore and repeditive and thier is little deviation between songs they sound like a third rate mainstream punk band not hardcore and no where near as awesome as they once were. WTF happened to H2O ? ROOTS?
3,H2O - Okay I Guess,"This album literally alternates between bad and good songs. First song - [bad]. Second song - good. Etc. Basically all of the faster songs (with the exception of ""Forest King"") are good. They are well put together, great guitars and drums, good positive lyrics. The slow songs have nothing going for them - some are them are so insipid that they defy description..."
2,"Good CD, But Not For H2O","I went to the record release show in NJ on the date of the release, and the 2 new songs they played (6 songs total) were a bit poppy, but they sounded okay. 2 hours later, I bought the CD. It is TOO... POPPY! It's not hardcore at all. Forest King isn't bad. Repair is alright. Underneath the Flames has a good last minute, and the Madonna cover song, Like A Prayer, is by far the best song. I love H2O to death, but please..."
4,Tired after being faster than the world,"H2O introduced me to punk and though I wouldn't say they sold out, this isn't really the hardcore H2O I loved. It's still a great album but fans will be pretty turned off. Hell, there's melodic songs in here! I'd almost say it's about as hardcore as the new Weezer album"
2,h2o no!,"I've been a pretty big fan of H2O for a while and i've seen them live a bunch of times. I was dreading this release because it was them on a big label, the same label that happens to be home to Blink 182 and fenix tx. The cd didn't really click with me when I listened to it, like all of their other cds did. I think most of the tracks lack the energy that most H2O songs have, which bothers me because H2O is one of the most energetic live bands. Almost all of the songs on it seem slower and more melodic, with the exception of ""Songs Remain"". They do cover ""like a prayer"" which I believe is really great cover. I guess I'll just have to wait and see what their next release is like."
4,"Nice, comfortable socks.","These socks feel great and look great. Not being a fan of men's socks that look opaque, I was concerned that they would be too thin, but I was presently proven wrong once I started wearing them. I took off one star since I think they are priced at least $3 too much."
4,Men's gold toe dress socks,These were a gift to my husband and were exactly what he wears and likes. When he needs more I will use this buyer.
5,This is a Great Hip Hop CD!,"This is an amazing all-around hip hop record. MC skills, amazing Beat-Box breaks, really nice production and beats and dope guests like Jurassic 5, Medusa, D.O.A., The L.K. and Akil. I highly recommend it."
4,Educational Game,"This is a great game to get your family educated on our presidential history. We've only played it once, but I can see the light bulbs turn on all of our heads as we learned some good info on our country's past. A must for familes with children leanring about us history."
2,too many errors,"I bought a new version to replace an old one, and was disappointed that factual errors on the question cards hadn't been corrected. Basically a trivia game with really hard trivia rather than general historical facts - more likely to ask Washington's shoe size than the turning point of the Revolutionary War."
3,Fun and Educational,"Very educational and fun for those with an interest in politics, no matter how much you know."
3,"Silly title, mediocre book","This book is a re-release of a book written during the Harlem Renaissance. There will much debate when the re-release hits shelves, just like when it first came out. The problem is, it's only a mediocre book. The author used the title to garner attention; unfortunately the book isn't good enough to warrant it. It's only a decent read at best. But, I would recommend reading it if for no other reason than so that you can know what everyone is talking about when the fireworks begin."
3,An under appreciated work from an appreciated artist,"Nigger Heaven was/is a highly controversal novel that came out during the Harlem Renaissance as noted before. I think for all that it is worth, Van Vetchen influenced a lot of the writers of the Harlem Renaissance. His importance to the period is fact,however one should look at the work before they judge it. It is an interesting look at how this work ignited the fire that fueled the lore of white america to black america; combining the once divided country."
5,High-intensity storytelling,"CODE: ALPHA is frighteningly prophetic! I can only hope that there is an ""ALPHA"" Team out there to protect us from crazies who might be plotting such an ingeniously simple biological terrorist strike"
3,Just misses on several counts,"There comes a point when the suspension of belief becomes to improbable to believe. This book tap dances over than line several times. The villians are super-terrorists (with super-mercenaries) able to outwit/outgun/and kill everyone except our two heroes. There is the slight love interest with the amazingly good looking genetics researcher. The book is enjoyable, but you will never be able to full suspend your reality and accept the book's reality."
2,good idea that falls apart,The book starts off well enough and is quite interesting until about half way. Then it becomes absurd with unrealistic military battles and characters who survive impossible situations. I do not recommend it unless you are so bored you have nothing better to do.
5,A Thriller With Lots of Surprises,"I started this book on Saturday afternoon -- finished Sunday morning. Scary! Besides having a great read I learned how vulnerable we are to biological terrorism -- my favorite Massucci book! If you haven't read any of his, try this one first. A very good novel indeed!"
2,Thought mine was broken :(,"I thought my DVD was broken until I read everyone else's reviews. I waited years for 90210 to come out on DVD. I only got through disc 1 and already, I'm disappointed. I thought the music changes in the 1st 3 seasons were bad enough, but now there are ENTIRE scenes missing! The worst part is that they show them in the end credits! Paramount Studios needs to give us what we want and deserve. Either play it all, in it's original music and scenes, or not at all. Aaron Spelling would be disappointed."
2,the 90's,"Great season, but it lacks 2 major components:1. Doesn't have original soundtracks2. Is not restored. Looks grainy"
2,90210,i purchased this dvd and one of the cds skips and I did try cleaning it but it pauses throughout the entire cd.
2,"The series was great, the DVD not so much!","I'm not through the whole season yet but I am already mad at the EXTENSIVE cutting of scenes in the Greek episode. The cheesy music instead of the music from the series I can tolerate (but am SO happy they kept the music in Season 3's finale) but the eliminating of scenes I cannot. They completely took out the storyline of Aundrea going ot the sorority with her star of David and only show the aftermath, cut out the girls showing up at Alpha house and cut out the end where the girls pledge to the Peach Pit sorority.They better pony up to the music rights because this is getting ridiculous. I won't pay money for DVDs with chopped up shows!"
3,if it ain't broke don't fix it,"the whole purpose of my buying bh90210 is to walk down memory lane. it's hard to do that when the musics been changed and scenes have been cut out. so far i've noticed several things. ""greek to me"" they cut out the scene where the girls are at the ceremony and andrea has on her star of david, then leslie walks by and looks at her all crazy. also in ""twenty years ago today"", ""what the world needs now"" was playing. i hate it when theses people mess with the music in tv box sets. the music is what paints the picture and reminds you of a particular moment."
5,very happy,"Received season quickly, no problems with transaction or with discs. Will purchase items from this seller again."
3,90210 -- Enough Said.,"I absolutely love this show...it's truly an obsession, but the only reason that I gave it three stars is because I CANNOT stand Brenda. When the show is on SoapNet, I avoid the seasons with Brenda on it. I think the 5th season is where it starts getting super good (in my opinion) and who could forget Season 10?? Awww :) David and Donna were always my favorite. Until the fifth season comes out, count me out for buying."
5,Very different and easy to listen to.,"I love music as long as it is done ""right"" and This album is ""right"". It's funky and down to earth. Very unique. I hear it differently each time I listen to it. I wish I could find it on cassette."
4,David&Ellie,"Informative and interesting but a little too much like a romance novel. However it does lay a great historical picture. The only ""over the top"" character is David the American pilot-and Ellie who struggles to be likeable"
2,Sad,"I purchased this item and it was as beautiful as it looked in online when I received it. However after a week of wearing it the dragonfly fell off somewhere so there was not point in wearing it anymore. It was great for the price, but I was disappointed that I was unable to enjoy it very long."
5,Ambrosia for the hair and scalp,"I was introduced to this product six years ago by my hairstylist, now I can't imagine having my hair colored without Palvin-Bid. It has a unique fragrance, a mix between rosemary and eucalyptus. You'll smell and feel the difference on your scalp. It calms the itchy feeling after coloring or other chemical processes. It rinses clean and leaves my thin hair feeling fuller and able to style. I'm delighted to find this product on the internet rather than paying an inflated price from my hairstylist! Thanks!"
4,Very Entertaining,A convoluted plot in which the villain sells out to the Berserkerswhile trying to make it appear that the Prince had. In which intelligent machines try to learn about politics and intrigue human style.A Prince as Napoleon at Elba in exile does an Archaeological digwhere he thinks he has discovered damaged a Berserkerwith an intact interstellar drive.The assassination of the Empress is part of the overall plot to entrapthe prince even in exile...
3,Not a great pillow,"The pillow arrived quickly and looked as pictured, but the fabric leaves a lot to be desired once seem in person. It is not pleasant to the touch and looks cheap in my opinion."
2,Regulator broken after less than 10 uses,"I am a homeowner. I rarely use this compressor and thought it was a ""good one"". I have used it less than 10 times in 1 year and the regulator is broken. They (Dewalt) are sending me a repair kit as a ""favor"" so we'll see if that fixes it. If your compressor lasts this long it is not worth much! This thing also puts out a lot of ozone when it runs....the electric motor must be doing this you can smell it!"
4,Good Unit But Draining Tank Difficult,"Compressor is very quiet and performs great, but location of drain valve for tank makes it very difficult to drain moisture. Drain valve is not at bottem of tank in storage or operating position. Have to prop unit up with something under handle to drain."
4,Air Compressor,"This air compressor is a little heavy for hand carry, 90+ pounds. But it works well and it is a lot quieter that the air compressor that I replaced. It also has more pressure. So far I really like it."
1,Defective BRAND NEW,"Bought from Lowe's for $329. Followed all the start-up procedures, ran it for 5 minutes and the tank pressure gauge would not go beyond zero. Tried it 3 times, and checking thoroughly both the drain and safety valves, but the resultsare still the same. I'll be returning this tomorrow and request replacement otherwise I go for another brand."
2,disappointed,"I purchased my DeWALT D55146 on 4/25/2007 and have a reoccurring problem. I had it for 3 months when it began leaking air from around the pressure adjusting valve. I took it to an authorized repair shop. It was repaired under the warranty, but the part was on back order and it stayed in the shop for over 4 months. The same problem has again occurred and of course it is now out of warranty. I took it back to the shop and I'm told the repair kit is on back order until September.I am very disappointed with this compressor and the availability of parts! It has spent almost as much time in the shop waiting for parts as it has in service. The fact that the replacement parts always on back order would seem to indicate that there is a problem with the design and/or manufacture of this model.The specs for this model look great on paper, but it has not performed well."
5,Read the specs!,"The DeWalt compressor is capable of 200psi. As such, a 300psi hose isrecommended. I learned only after reading the user's manual and had toreturn a 250psi hose. Great jobsite compressor!"
1,Recurring Pressure Regulating Valve Problem,This compressor works well except for the pressure regulating valve leaking air. It was fixed once while under warranty and now is leaking again. The leaking is substantial enough that the compressor runs non-stop. Extremely irritating.
1,What happened to QC??,"I plugged in the product and it built up pressure as expected; all seemed well. Then, I turned off the unit to find that the clamp on the hose to the regulator had never been clenched! The thing leaked like a screen door in a submarine. Obviously it had never been tested before shipment! Very disappointing! Must be a ""Made in China thing""!Makita from here on in!"
5,labradore books,"This is a pritty good book about labradores. It teaches you the basic stuff about them. It also teaches you what their specialties and habits are. It has some pritty good information about their lives, and if you owned a lab i recomend checking this book out!"
3,"Adventurous! SOME great blends of Jazz,Afican and Techno","A few songs like Prague City Lights are worth the CD alone, at times: This song has a great blend of harmonies and is more mainsteam then most of the CD. Songs like People, Research & Development, and Headfake, REQUIRE you to like Techno and are fantastic. While a song like Trance is just out there, period."
5,Exellent,It took a while for the book to get to me but it was worth the wait. This book was in excellent condition for the price and I am happy I went with this product. Thanks so much for giving me a great product!
5,Great Book!,"This is one of the best books that I have read on Domestic Violence so far! Being a survivor and advocate for Domestic Violence myself, everyone needs to read this book! Very Good!"
3,BEASTLY but lacking,"I purchased this disc on a whim because I heard of them performing in NYC and I was pretty fond of Japanese metal rockers in general.This is my first time hearing them - they are heavy, brutal or savage at times but to me that's not enough. This album was also very lacking in creativity and diversity. Even their brothers in the band called LOUDNESS are just as heavy but alot more enjoyable to experience because Akira knows how to bring it on with some diverse experimentation and guitar solos which this band DIR EN GREY is totally devoid of.The opening song is somber, melancholic, epic and dramatic with piano and vocal emotions but that's the only song you will hear on the disc that shows their softer and creative side. All of the other songs are pretty gruesome but lacking and I wonder what is the point? This makes them no better than SLIPKNOT.I expect better from these guys.Enough said!"
5,Another amazing album from Dir en Grey,"I've been a fan of Dir en Grey since 2003 and have yet to be disappointed or bored with them. Each album has its own sound while still consistently delivering excellent music and vocals. I have to admit, when I first heard the 30 second previews for The Marrow of a Bone, I was a bit worried that the entire album was just Kyo screeching and little else. However, upon listening to the songs in full, I found that just like every other Dir en Grey album, the previews really didn't do the album justice. The elements that I always have loved- Kyo's mixing of melodic emotion-filled vocals with growling and screaming- are still there and musically the band still excels with interesting riffs and bass lines. Overall, I was very impressed by the album and very glad that I gave it a chance. Highly recommended."
2,boring!!,"I enjoyed Uncle Tom's Cabin and thought this would be just as good from the North's point of view but not a story at all, more like a documentary."
1,Do not buy this product!!!,"The program will not install. I get an error that says ""Access Denied"" and my Antivirus program says that it has malware on it."
5,Nice Maps and Trail Descriptions,"I have taken many of the trails listed in this book and was impressed with the accurate trail maps which include mileage markers, geologic features, and elevations of mountain peaks. Trail descriptions include the distance, estimated time required, start and end elevations, and technical ratings. The book is useful for both mountain bikers and hikers. About fifty pages are devoted solely to trails in the Santa Ana Mountains. Unfortunately, recent development has eliminated some of the trailheads, especially in Aliso & Wood Canyons Park."
2,Beware! Not updated in 9 years,"My first attempt to use this book got me lost before I even found the trail-head. I am now wary of using this book, and looking for something more up to date."
4,"A little dated, but a good resource.","I was looking for new trails to ride in Orange County, so I ordered this book realizing it was printed quite a few years ago. Some of the dated material I've noticed so far is park entrance fees, as for trails, some of the other reviewers here may have more to offer. But many of the trails are still there and are worth checking out."
3,Good but sometimes misleading,"Have now done 3 or 4 of the rides, generally the descriptions are quite accurate but on a couple of occasions the descriptions are very misleading for example a low technical rating for one ride which was one of the most technical rides I have ever done! I wouldn't follow the ratings guidance too closely for this reason"
4,Heavenly soulfull,Just loved this CD!!!! You'll be singing or humming this to yourself for hours after you hear it. If you are 35 years old or older you'll LOVE it. The memories will come flooding back to you. Enjoy it!!!
4,Very good for old times sake,"I purchased this album because I used to own this record on its vinyl version back in the seventies.It brings lots of memories.Many songs are still being played on the radio.Best song of all: ""I Just Don't Want to be Lonely"".Decided to buy this album again just because of this lovely song (its arrangements, rhythm, lyrics, instrumentation, etc.).This song has also been recorded by other R&B; bands, like ""THE MAIN INGREDIENT"". I've never known which of them is the composer of the song, but BLUE MAGIC's version is, by far, the best.BLUE MAGIC's style is similar to STYLISTICS, but let me tell you STYLISTICS is even better than BLUE MAGIC."
2,"bizarre? incomprehensible? Sadly, yes to both.","'The Atrocity Exhibition' has to be one of the strangest books out there. It's not so much of a novel but rather endless snippets of sex, death and automobiles all twirled together. Somehow deceased celebrities get thrown into the mix, adding to the perversion. Mercifully short, this book is a jumbled mess. Yet for some reason the author really likes this topic and subsequently wrote 'Crash', a marginally better read.Bottom line: a book that is not only not for everyone, I think it clearly isn't for anyone except for blindly loyal fans of the author. Simply awful."
2,a warning to the unversed,"i bought the book because of the rave reviews, because i fancy myself to be progressive and able to think on many levels. however, i was not able to grasp this book - or collection of short essays, or vignettes, or whatever - even with the foreward by burroughs and the extended commentary by ballard. confusion made reading a chore, and not an enjoyable one (where after a mighty struggle i manage to decipher an idea enough to get my mental teeth into it so that i can digest it later).what i mean to say is NOT that this is a bad book, but rather that it is not for those who aren't familiar with ballard's philosophies/notions of automobiles and sex. i wish i could have understood these concepts more because the writing itself was excellent and the structure of the book interestingly different from everything i am used to.in a word: beware."
2,"Difficult to start, a chore to finish","Ballard makes several keen insights in this book (many of them startlingly prescient). However, digging those nuggets of clarity out of the surrounding mess is difficult and often unrewarding work. The repetetive and disjointed nature of the narrative quickly leads to confusion--confusion about the characters, their motives, and the surrounding events. And perhaps that was intentional, but it doesn't make for a satisfying read.""The Assasination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race"" was one of the few bright spots in the narrative, but not quite bright enough for me to consider this book as anything more than a failed experiment."
2,Poorly made documentary,"Although this documentary uses extensive footage from Valentino's films and good photographs, the details and information concerning Valentino's life is only glossed over. For example, the segment about Valentino's death shows newspaper headlines but the narrator fails to even mention what Valentino died from! For those interested in Valentino's personal life, you won't find it here. The infamous fact concerning his first wife is not mentioned (she threw him out of their room and the marriage was never consummated) nor is Valentino's homosexuality discussed. There is so much footage from ""Blood and Sand"" and ""Son of the Shiek"" shown that you feel as though you have watched the entire film. The dvd will be enjoyed by Valentino fans but for those interested in a good documentary in the vein of A&E's Biography series will be disappointed. You can find out more about Valentino's life from a brief entry in a film encyclopedia than you can from this documentary."
3,Short and Not So Sweet,"More of an extended essay with unrelated anecdotes, this tiny book concerns the brief partnering of author Evan Hunter (aka Ed McBain) and Alfred Hitchcock over a few years on the films ""The Birds"" and ""Marnie."" Dropped in the midst of these alternately bitter and fond memories are totally unrelated anecdotes about ""Hitch."" Nifty, but so short you should read it in the bookstore and save the $12.95."
3,Really short and easy to read,"But worth the time. It's very interesting. As some other reviewers have said, most of it is anecdotes... but they are very interesting all the same. Evan Hunter talks mostly about ""The Birds"" and the script and story developments as he writes about them are very good. He talks a bit about ""Marnie"" as well but since he didn't work very long on that, he didn't have much to say.I recommend you to read this, but unless you like to own everything about or by Hitchcock, just get it from the library first... : )"
1,Far Worse ...,"when I tried to contact the seller, he is not available anymore! No one likes to be cheated and pay 30 US$ for nothing! I thought that when there was a problem back then that the order was canceled because I did not want to buy it anymore. But now after all these years, I found out that it was credited to my credit card and I did not get anything in the end ... Way to go really!!"
2,duelo de dos grandes pedro yerena y mario saucedo vol.1 y 2,I want to buy these two titles pedro yerena & mario saucedo volumen 1 and 2
2,Jackie Chan must protect his family from a deadly syndacate.,"A very good kung fu flick much like ""The Big Boss"" shows a very young Jackie before he had his eye surgery. Great film if you love kung fu movies if you don't you may be bored out of your mind. Although this film was not completed they used a stand in to complete the film yet it still quite enjoyable. END"
4,more chantastic action,forget most of the reviews up there tis movie is not half bad its funny its got some good fights in the only thing that recks it is the voices but as for the dvd its not that good of a copy but it is wachable and i like the film i give it 4 stars for a jackie chan fanatic like me its a must buy for only six pound hwo could moan it hasent got any extras but the films good enough for meps.you may recognise some scenes from drunken master
3,Fair movie...,"This is a fair movie, nowhere near Jackie's greatest or funniest, but can be a little humorous at times, like the part where the master FARTS right into the other dudes face...oww...that must stink! I rate this movie 3 stars."
1,Only little Jackie here.,"This film features only little Jackie, instead they used a double to complete some scenes including the final fight. You can see when the double is playing because you see him training in a dimly lit shack and in the final fight the fighters use blindfolds to cover their faces so you won't see it aint Jackie! AKA Master With Cracked Fingers."
2,This movie is pretty bad,"I am a Jackie Chan fan, but this movie is not that great. The acting is bad, the scenes are choppy, and the fight sequences are not anything spectacular. Personally, I found it a hardship to watch the whole movie. The only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of one is the fact that Jackie Chan is in part of the movie."
1,Good luck getting this DVD to play well...,"For starters, I will admit that the widescreen presentation of the English dub of this film is probably the best I've seen of any release of it. However, the film itself is a mediocre patchwork mess, with plenty of footage with a Jackie double. During one fight scene, blink and you'll miss both Mars and Yuen Biao, longtime JC collaborators.The biggest problem with this release is that the DVD is poorly manufactured. On two different DVD players, I could not get the disc to read properly. The disc would jump to random chapters every ten minutes or so in one DVD player; it wouldn't even read at all in the other one! I would suggest saving your money and, if you really MUST have this movie, buy one of the many other releases of the film. No matter how you slice it, the film isn't very good anyway, letterboxed or not!"
1,Some respect please,"I have never seen this movie, nor will I out of respect for Jackie Chan. This is not a real movie. When Jackie left his first director, a hack names Lay Lo, (Bruce Lee fan may reconize the name, he took credit for the first few movies Bruce made) Jackie had to sign over the rights to all of his early movies to him (on account this jerk sicked the Tri-ad on Jackie). With the rights to Jackie's early films, and Jackie now a smash hit, Lo hacked up Jackie's older films, and used bits and peaces on of each of them to make a ""new movie"" called Master with Cracked Fingers.To learn more about this read Jackie's Autobiography, I Am JACKIE CHAN."
2,Not one of his best.,"This is not one of Jackie Chan's best, but if you are a fan, this is definetly worth the money. A lot of typical Jackie action and some really good fight scenes. All in all, not a total waste of money."
2,Weird Jackie Chan 'fu flick,"This, Jackie's first starring role, definately didn't make him into a kung fu star like he had hoped. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because, of course, it has Jackie Chan in it and because of some weird demented humor. I have to warn you that the fight scenes are pretty bad. If you want to see a 70's JC kung fu flick, get Drunken Master or Snake in the Eagle's Shadow."
3,a funny movie,"This is one of Jackie Chans early roles. It is a silly movie, mixed with a little drama, but it will keep you chuckling most of the time. I gave it three stars because though I enjoyed it, I don't want you to believe it ranks up there with Chan's more recent movies. If you like Jackie's brand of kung-fu comedy you'll like this."
3,"Looks good, but...","Looks good, but if you have long hair, it gets caught in the necklace, all over, not just around the clasp but in the entire body of the necklace."
3,NO TIRES AROUND,"I don't have a problem with the toy itself, I'm having a problem with getting a replacement part (rear tire) I'm told that it is on back order and will not be in stock until the middle of August. They are either having problem with all rear tires or problems with ordering replacement tires and the wait is too long for an item to be shipped out. My son got his for Christmas and has only ridden it about 10 times before the rear tire went out. It is summer time and he still has not ridden it while on his summer vacation, due to the fact we can not get a rear tire that we ordered back in June."
2,Run time is Poor!,"This item never holds it's charge and has really been a huge disappointment for our pocketbook. Our son would charge it, ride it out of the garage and down our driveway, and before he arrived at the driveway directly next door, it would lose its charge and have to be walked back... A real bummer for the kids each and every time.Anna Maria, Orland Park, IL"
2,A kid's review,"This toy of a pocket bike is good for beginners, but for kids who want to go above a whimpy 10 miles an hour this is'nt a very good choice. I mean really, think about it, gas powered pocket bikes are faster, more durable and all around more fun, even if they are more dangerous."
5,cool bike or what,I think that every parent should by there child a mini motor bike because they are so much fun and probaly every kid wants one so go and stand up to your parents and say i would like a mini motor bike from toys r us because i feel that i need one to have fun thats all im asking for and thay will probaly say no but you just keep beging thats what i do and it works so see ya and dont be afraid.........
5,this mini bike is allsome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,man i been waiting a long time to get this thing and now im getteing it for christmas dont get a gas one they r unsafe if u wont to get one u do but its unsafe this one is not this is the best won out there get this won
2,not worth the money,"this toy goes really slow.it only goes 14mph for 10 minutes.the rest of the time,it goes about 8mph.I put a custom speedometer,charged it for 2 days,and it would only go 14mph.in ten minutes it only went 7.3mph.A few days ago,i was riding it around my neighborhood and my throttle snapped off.to top it all off,yesterday my friends tire popped after hitting a rock.this thing is not worth the price.I recently got a gas pocket bike,which comes with a speedometer,and i went 34.7mph in 7 seconds!i dont have to wait 8hours to charge ,now i just give it some gas ,jump rocks,and go fast. P.S. the gas one was only 239 bucks!"
3,Disaster for Christmas,We had been searching all over for this Minimoto Maxi Bike..call and visiting stores plus checking online everyday for 2 weeks..Finally we drive out from Jersey City to Secausus excited to purchase 2 of them..Only to realize that both bikes have a problem with the handle bars not staying in place..so now we have two bike that the kids can not ride and the box states that if any problem we need to contact the manufacturer..so we did and their solution is to send us new handle bars..so now we have to unassemble the bikes and hope that doesnt create another problem or paying someone to..I think that unfair after paying 300 dollars for each bike..Please be aware!!
4,What a Ride!,"A great minibike. The Mini Moto was a gift for my son. He and his friends have almost worn the tires out. The only issue we had with this purchase was that it arrived with a malfunctioning battery. After a few phone calls to the manufacturer, they happily shipped a new battery and we were off and running.Overall this is one of the best purchases we have made for our son. Now if left witht he choice of video games or going out to ride -- he chooses outdoors!"
5,Can't Wait,Well I wrote the reveiw with the long list of everything you need to know. Againg I hope that list helped alot of people. Any ways I was just thinking about the Maxii Bike and decided to come on line. [...] And alot of people are saying things are get messed up really fast maybe it wasn't ment for you to have a bike. Just remeber this web teamminimoto it has realllllllyyyyyy good things about electric bikes. and when you go go to trouble shooting on the very top to see what you can do to help your bike.
5,great toy,We bought this at walmart and we tried it out and it worked great and nothing went wrong and it rides smoothly.It was worth $150.00!
3,Back Weel Bye-Bye,My Honda Maxii Bike is really cool! My friend was the first one to wipe out on it. He bent the brake cord on the fall and since the brake cord was bent the bike was going slower than it should of been going. It was going slower because of the bent brake and I ran over somthing pointy and it punctured my back tire. My dad and I went to ACE the hardware store and got a new inertube for it then we went home and fixed it. My dad had to take it apart without any directions because the manual didn't tell you how. He put it back together still he couldn't use the manual because it didn't tell him how. Thank goddness it still goes fast!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,The coolest thing in the world,"The reason that this pocketbike is the coolest thing in the world is that it can reach speeds of 21mph! i weigh about 100 pounds and 13 years old, and im the perfect size for this bike. I use it to get around to a friends or just to ride it around the neighborhood. I also have an electric-scooter but that doesnt even come close to the Maxii. I dont know what the other two people are talking about saying the handlebars get loose and that it slows down in grass. The handlebars just need some tightening with the allen-wrench provided. And ive ridden this bike in grass and it still holds its speed pretty well. This is an all around good product and definetly worth the money."
3,Warranty and Service are difficult,"Bought my son a minimoto for his birthday, he loved it. After 5 months it stopped working. Pepboys would not honor the warranty, sent me to Toyquest.com. Toyquest registration forms online blew up each of the 15 times I tried to register and had the MaxII listed twice on the same drop down. 800# took 30 minutes of redialing to get past busy signal, then after an hour on hold got full answering machine. Email address on toyquest website customerservice@minimoto.com bounces back. Also have contradictory information on where the serial number is, the one on the chasis was rejected online,I almost thought that the warranty was a shell game, but then got a call from a helpful person from Manly Toys with Assistance.Comparing notes with neighbors who had the same problem, I was lucky, it took them 4 days of dialing to get past the buzy signal."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,I PURCHASED THE MINIMOTO FOR MY SON WHO IS 5.HE ALSO HAS THE RAZOR2000 AND THE CHOPPER.THE MINIMOTO IS SHARP AND VERY SPORTY BUT LACKS THE POWER AND SPEED THAT THE RAZOR HAS.WE CHARGED THE BATTERY THE TIME TOLD IN THE MANUAL BUT IT IS VERRY SLOW AND SLUGGISH. IS THERE ANY THING THAT COULD BE CAUSING THE SLOW SPEEDS? OYHER PEOPLE WE HAVE TALKED TO SAYS THE MINIMOTO WILL BEET THE RAZOR BUT NOT THIS ONE. THANKS
1,The Minimoto,"Last year,for new years, i got the minioto maxii. it was awesome for two weeks and then my chain started to constantly pop off and one day i flipped it and my throttle broke.the body work is impossible to take off to get to the engine.then, about two weeks later, my tire popped.it took four hours to install the new one. i do not reccomend this TOY to anyone. this isn't made by honda, manley, or even toy quest.Don't buy this chinese [...]!"
2,broke after 2 hours use,"Great concept and lots of fun...while it works. Battery wasn't the problem, it was the motor. The motor was broken after 2 hours of use. We called the manufacturer for help, and was shipped a ""replacement part"". The motorcycle still doesn't work(and yes, it was installed correctly). Overall, [...]. We are stuck with a $300.00 toy that got 2 hours use!"
4,Way better than the usual Twizzlers,"I was involved with a Teach-In at my daughter's school. Since my subject was the visible spectrum and how rainbows get created, this box of Rainbow Twizzlers provided the perfect handout (along with some diffraction-grating glasses). The kids went wild!Since there was a pack or two left over, I tried a few of the Twizzlers. They were fruit-flavored and quite tasty when compared with the standard dark red Twizzler variety. My daughter (and son) loved them."
4,Great help,"The book was a great help for the college search. The layout is much more friendly and easier to read than other guides, and more personalized details make it less like an editorial staff writing it and more of your best friend tell you about the college."
4,"Not the Only book you need, but good non the less","This book is great. When picking which college to go to, use this book along with Princetonreview, Fiskes, and another book of your choosing that catches your eye. Don't just rely on one book, each has it's own personality and will give you different insights on the schools."
4,Better quality than expected,"The image was better than expected considering the films were made 100 years ago.Sometimes the music that was supposedly added on later stops in places andthe DVD case is made of paper and without any liner notes, which I was hoping for.But overall, a satisfactory quality DVD."
2,Should be called - 20% Theory 30% Mediawiki and 50%Twiki,"I was expecting this book to be a guide on how to best design a Wiki for collaboration. Half the book is useless if you don't plan to use Twiki. With over 50 wiki's out there ""what are the odds"". I was very upset and returned the book. I felt ripped off for the price. If you are using Mediawiki, the first part of this book (Theory/Mediawiki) can easily be found on the internet."
2,Rak's Wreck,"Mr. Rak is one of the finest guitarists in the world and he can play wonderful stuff. This CD, however, is the worse possible collection of his music. Do Mr. Rak a favor and don't buy this CD. It is an embarassment."
3,"Ehh, So-So","Well, I was a little disappointed with this volume. Perhaps the title should be 100 Best IDEAS/INSPIRATIONS for Retirement Business. It really did not go into a lot of detail on most of the subjects. It may tweak your interest in that business, but you will definitely have to still do more research and ""How To"" books to go any further. Sorry, but to me it was a 3 star (would have been a 2.5 had it been possible)."
1,"Shoddy construction, broke the second time I used it","Used this juicer exactly twice to juice lemons and the second time, one of the latches on the side of it broke off completely."
5,healthy,"looking for natural ways to cure ailments, love this product. easy to clean, does what it should without a lot of waste!"
4,Good juicer - small grate,"I like the juicer overall. The large grate and tube make it nice to juice quickly. The small grate for the juicer is too small for juicing and clogs quickly. I can not juice heavy skinned or thick products or I have to clean out the grate 1/2 way through. Overall, I like the juicer."
4,Great Juicer,"I have used this for about 3 months and find that it works great. A bit loud, but makes great juice. Fairly easy to take apart and clean up. It is much easier to place a plastic bag in the fiber container before juicing. Less cleanup, but smelly trash! I recently recieved a new Breville Juicer for Christmas. I find that this one works just as well. It is not as pretty and is very basic, but if you just want good juice, this one is sufficient."
1,not satisfied,I tried making carrot juice and more carrots sprayed across my entire kitchen than was turned into juice. Most of the veges went into the pulp chamber and it was very hard to clean.
3,Good one if you are ready to spend more time in cleaning,"I bought this juicer a month back and using it atleast 3 to 4 times a week. It is really a good one and can able to extract more than what I expected. But only problem is the filter. You need to clean the filter in between the process in order to get more juice. I use to clean it every glass of juice and in my experience, I get the same amount of juice if I clean it. Otherwise, I will get only around 75% of it and it keep reducing until you clean it. One good thing is the brush that has been provided with it which is very useful to reach all the corners of the filter and tray."
1,There are much better pear vinegars,"This pear vinegar is based in white wine vinegar. I don't think it has the subtlety and exquisite taste of a pear vinegar based in golden balsamic vinegar, and they are no more expensive. I tried this in a recipe I have made many times for pear vinagrette, and the taste was clearly inferior. Sparrow Lane sells a balsamic based pear vinegar. They are also available at Whole Foods, if you've got one near you."
5,An inside look,"A truly wonderful and entertaining inside look at one man's rise to grace...and subsequent fall. Who knew that anyone could have destroyed themselves so perfectly as to lose contract after contract and deal after deal because they just could not keep their mouth shut. I definitely recommend this one, since it gives us all a lovely lesson in the fine and maybe lost art of humility."
1,Bad Doc,"Just Troy Duffy yelling at people for 82 minutes and destroying relationships. Many reviewers here have given it positive reviews due to the material as you see someone bury their career, and unfortunately, schadenfreude is a big part of our society. However, it's told from only one point of view, probably due to access issues; there's no interviews with the studios that dropped the project (Miramax mostly). The final product, The Boondock Saints, wound up being a pretty terrible movie anyway, although Troy says about 100 times in the movie that he's the best in the business. There's probably a good reason the studios passed on it. They probably realized it wasn't going to fly, so they dropped the deal. Welcome to the real world Troy. I wish I hadn't wasted my time on this one."
5,Learning Tool,"As a script writing hopeful, this movie really shows you the no no's of the movie business. If only Troy could have been a more positive person and less of an a-hole, he may have been something. To think that the Boon Dock Saints was slated for a 15 mil budget, shows that that movie could have been awesome. I don't blame Harvey Weinstien for not sticking his neck on the line with that loose cannon."
2,Missing some key info and a little difficult to hear,"The documentary clearly shows that Troy Duffy is an arrogant jerk, but doesn't tell the whole story of his rise and fall. It starts with his story being bought by Mirimax, then goes to trying to cast the movie, and suddenly it's falling apart and the movie isn't being made. Then they try to get someone else to make it, but nobody wants to for some reason. We jump from milestone to milestone, but there isn't a good explanation of why things are happening.Smaller nitpick, and admittedly I don't have the best hearing in the world, but this documentary is in desperate need of some subtitles or closed captioning."
2,DUMB HAS-BEEN,"good to watch one time...not exactly something you'll repeatedly watch, not with all the yelling, screaming, and egomania.documentary about a would-be film maker...AND would-be rock star. egomaniac star of the documentary, and his friends, don't realize that they are too old, fat, and balding, for the mtv tween generation---which is where the real money and fame is now days."
4,How to be a loser,"At first, I thought this was some kind of spoof, a drama about how a guy can blow it all while being completely oblivious about how stupid he is being. Then it slowly sank in that this is a true story, a documentary about a real individual who secured a movie and album deal and proceeded to completely alienate everyone and lose it all. I never heard of the movie, ""The Boondock Saints"" or the band of the same name, but I'm going to look them up. This docu picks up steam as it goes along."
2,Holes don't align well,"The holes don't align perfectly. Also, it is difficult when you're building to see where the hole should be. A plastic marble run would have been a better choice for us. The children wanted a faster building pace with the marbles."
4,Great creative toy,"My three year old needs a bit of help, but when he gets the hang of it, he will be able to create marble mazes on his own. I didn't give it five stars because the set could really use some uneven pieces to create more gravity for the marbles. Other than that, it's a great toy!"
5,Marble Maze,"Is a good toy. My grandchildren love to build things. Even my husband had fun building new designs. Being made of wood, make it very sturdy."
3,"Ok, but got boring quickly.","Pros:Nice qualityDurableFun... for whileCons:Difficult for kids to set up anything larger then 3 rows high and still actually work.Limited on the type of 'mazes' you can set up and have it function.Kids will play with it for about 15 min every few months, not a fave in our houseWe much prefer the plastic sets that actually hook together. We can build really creative mazes that are 3 feet high with the plastic ones. This just wasn't as much fun."
5,And then there was .... Becker,"Channel surfing one night, a few years back, changed my viewing pleasure as I found Becker. I missed the first season over here in NZ and so was absolutely thrilled to find it listed at Amazon.It has now been approx 2 months and 7 days since I pre orderd the season 1 release. It should be here by the weekend and I have planned to watch it all over 2 days!!!For its dry, hold no punches comedy it has to be one of the greats. Ted Danson gives us yet another character that you sometimes wish you had the guts to be like and get away with it.Why is it that the great shows are cut off in their prime or moved to late night TV? And yet the mindless crap still gets prime time spots that I can't believe anybody really watches and enjoys.The answer to this I fear will never be known, all I can say is keep releasing the greats to DVD ... All seasons of Becker are definitely on my purchase list."
5,Classic and Hilarious,"You can tell this series is from the 90's, but it is timeless! The characters are endearing - even John. Highly recommend."
4,"Becker gets 5 stars, DVD gets 3","One of my pet peeves is people who comment on the content of a DVD or Blue-ray disc without telling you anything about the quality of the recording.I'm not going to comment on the content. Anyone who's watched Becker knows how great the show was and doesn't need to be told again.I'm elated that they're finally releasing Becker on DVD. But why did they have to screw up for the first season?This DVD disables the instant replay button on my player. If I miss a line, it's a pain to rewind to play over again. I don't have the same problem with the second season. There they did it right. Other than that everything is great. Even closed captioning works so you don't miss any gags."
5,"""OK Bob, here it is...""","I love this show, the rerun episodes are aired at 12:30 am, I start work at 8:00 am, and still I watch it almost every night.I sent emails to the producing studios years ago to release it on DVD,..all gone unanswered and ignored.finally, I can sleep early, and still watch Becker, the doctor that says it as it is, and as all of us wish to be able to say it to all the ""Bob""s of our lives..."
5,Love it!,Absolutely love Becker! Didn't think it would live up to Cheers but boy was I wrong! Anyone know when will the other seasons be released to DVD?
1,Will not last as a storage medium.,"I bought Imation cds to store my data years ago, alongside some memorex cds and another nameless brand. All of them work except for my Imation cds which turned a strange hue. Their contents aren't even readable. It's as if the cds were made out of biodegradable material--and they did just that. Despite being kept in perfect conditions, they're ruined and whatever was on them is lost. I'm pretty pissed. All the other cd brands still work. This was 10 years ago."
4,Good buy,Received the CD's in record time. The only problem: the case was broken due to poor packing but it still holds the CD's just fine.
1,Trash,"These blank CD's are trash. Not worth the money. Do not buy them, spend the extra money and get a better brand of black recordable disc."
5,sounds rushed /but good songs,"Schenker /Keeling,,,way cool...he didn't really work w/ the Norum project. A Wanna be Schenker clone,,,It is a very vocal record,,,all about the lyrics and songs.. some great classic Schenker of course.Doesn't sound like he is trying to excel but he sounds like Michael,, He is great here as well as the band,,although I think the production lacks .badly,,,,adats?I will get the Live one I bet it smokes the studio versions,,,,Fat city is really cool...TOWER<<,that melody stays with me all day ,,drives me nuts..Rude Awakening is a great one .I relate to the lyrics. Great Vocal...I hope there will be another one w/ the two of them,,grown together,, if you are reading this guys ...Thanks.."
2,hit or miss album,"Honestly this album is not as bad or as good as the other reviewers have panned it out to be. Half of this CD is good while the other half needs to be re-worked or thrown out. Only Turning Off The Emotion stands out to me on this album. Rude Awakening is good along with ILLUSION, THE STORM, AND TOWER but it needs a better solo somewhere in it. The rest just isn't finished. Get Written in the Sand or THANK YOU CD before you buy this. It should never be compared to the brillant album Assault Attack..it is not that good but this album is not trash as a one person suggested About half the album does have some worth especially Turning Off The Emotion and Tower (if it were produced rigth could be a classic) and a little different direction for MSG but basically parts of the Cd needed to be re-done or produced better. I own every MSG album and UFO so I should know a little about what this compares to."
1,FLOP,"WHEN I HEARD THIS CD, I CHECKED ALL THE PAPER WORK OUT TO MAKE SURE IT WAS A MSG CD - TO PUT IT SIMPLE (AND THIS IS COMING FROM A HUGE MSG FAN), THIS CD STINKS - THERE IS NOT 1 SONG ON THIS CD THAT IS ABOVE AVERAGE IN ANY WAY - WHAT HAPPENED MICHAEL??? - THE VOCALIST WAS AT HIS PEAK WHEN HE WAS WITH BATON ROUGE - HIS VOICE GOES NOWHERE NOW - SORRY GUYS - I HONESTLY THINK THIS CD SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN RELEASED - IT PUT A BAD MARK ON A GREAT LINE OF CD'S FROM MSG"
1,how bad can it get,"The vocals are brutally bad and songs are lifeless, the live show supporting this album--when the songs from this album were played got NO reaction at all from the fans."
1,Not Formatted for Kindle 2,It is Saki so of course the stories are marvelous. My one star is for the Kindle Edition. Every other line only contains two words so it is not a smooth block of text for the eye to follow.
3,Hard to follow,I generally love John Buchan. The whole Richard Hannay stories were wonderful. This was a big hard for me to follow and get into. I will probably give it another try in a year or so. I do love to re-read good books.
5,Foot Valve,This foot valve works great for keeping your pump primed and not letting the water back flow into the rain barrel. I have been using this device everyday and it has not let me down.
4,Make sure you buy the IMPORT - not the US version!,"The awesome song that is playing during the card game (Liar, Liar by the Castaways) is ABSENT from the US release as well as several others! BIG mistake in my opinion."
4,"As always, better in England","The original version of this soundtrack is one of the best I've heard. Cool funk and excellent bass lines. However this is NOT the original. where are all the other tracks, why no Stone Roses?"
4,From start to finish it's full of fun and phat grooves.,"While on a recent trip the the UK, a good friend of mine had the CD and I must have listened to it everyday for a week and loved every minute of it. It was not until two weeks later that I finally saw the movie. This album contains some GREAT clips from some of the best scenes in the move too. The movie and the CD are a must see and hear."
3,you already know,if you like the movie chances are this cd is for you..however if your only after a few tracks easier to download them at a buck a piece. the disc is ripe with soundbytes and quotes which are entertaining but unless you enjoy them that much i think the music can be had cheaper.
4,Great movie - Great soundtrack,"Really liked this movie for a long time. Other great soundtracks reminded me to search this one out and a fine listen this is - the soul tracks, the 70s stuff, and of course the outtakes from the movie. There's plenty of good material unheard before."
4,love that funk,"if you saw the movie and loved, then this CD is for you. if you like funk street music, then this CD is for you. if you just appreciate james brown and the mellow sounds of funk with a bit of techno, then this CD is for you. i saw the movie and loved it!! it was a fun movie to watch - had me sitting at the edge of my seat with anxiousness and anticipation. the soundtrack worked really well with the movie especially the first music in the movie by E-Z Roller."
3,Not as shabby as the critics said it was . . .,"This low-budget 1977 Kung Fu flick has heartbroken Chan obsessing over his girlfriend Chin-Chin, who has been ""stolen"" by one of his good friends (who just turns out to be THE bad guy). The plot is excessively complicated and not easily understood, but, in a way, the film is touching. It's part love story, part Kung Fu slapstick. The fight scenes are reasonable, with young Chan displaying great gymnastics feats; but the stunts don't nearly rank up with the best of Jackie. I was slightly moved by Jackie's performance, but, to be perfectly honest, it was mediocre at best. The low budget is quite evident, with cheap props (like a rubber hand), and ""dress for less"" costumes. But, hey, if you're a Chan-atic like myself, buy it. Someday, it might be a collector's item."
3,To Kill With INtrigue (1977),"Chu Feng is on a mission to kill Jackie's family. She butchers everyone exept for Jackie, she falls in love with him and later saves his life by putting Jackie through a torturous trainning regimen so that Jackie can defend himself against some two-faced ""friends"". This film is chillingly violent!!!"
3,nice addition for a Jackie fan,"This movie is definitely worth getting if you're a huge Jackie fan. It's got a nice plot compared to some other lesser-known titles from his early years, and he is actually in this movie quite a bit- this is not a cameo role."
3,"Great film; awful, awful disc.","To Kill With Intrigue is a great little kung-fu movie; if you like the genre, you'll dig it. Mind you, this disc is so mind-numbingly awful that it's hard to watch. The video transfer is grainy and spotted, the audio fades in and out and pops, and just to add insult to injury, while the film has both english and cantonese audio, there are no subtitles; nor is there even a menu option to change the audio- it must be done manually.Certainly worth the purchase if you can find it for [$$$] ...- good as the film itself is, this is low-quality enough that you shouldn't be expected to pay any more."
2,Only for Die Hard Jackie Chan Fans,"Don't expect a lot from this film. Although it is better than some of Jackie's earlier films under his contract with Lo Wei (New Fist of Fury, The Killer Meteors, Dragon Fist, and many others), it's not that great. The acting is pretty dull throughout most of the movie. The entire film is so full of plot wholes and boring scenes, that you rarely care about what's happening. Most of the action is better than some of Jackie's other movies from the early 70s, but they still need lots of work. Although some of them are interesting, the action is way too slow to fully entertain any Jackie Chan fan. This film should only be seen if you want to complete your Jackie Chan collection."
5,A must have,"If you are gonna install a drip system you will use alot of these tees and they are good ones. I have used some tees that come with other fittings in a kit and they always break. These,however, are quality tees, definately recomended."
2,Not an encyclopedia and very little depth on the War.,"This book should be called ""Sociological essays on the era of the Revolutionary War."" It is not arranged as an encyclopedia and has relatively little material on the Revolutionary War. You will not find the words ""regiment"" or ""battle"" in the index, and a search for date-specific material will be nearly fruitless. Less than a third of the 34-page poorly arranged parallel-stream ""timeline"" concerns the period 1775-1783. If you want specific material on the Revolutionary War, look elsewhere."
3,Balance review,"The CD is not bad. I wouldn't rush out and buy it, though. Although, in retrospect, that's what I did. Well, it's enjoyable, anyways. It seems a bit amateurish, but, hey, I couldn't do better."
4,Better Design Than Newer Proxabrush Handle,"I'm so glad this older version of Proxabush Handle is still available from Amazon.com. My opinion is that this is better than the newer single-ended design (model # 625) made by Sunstar Americas Inc. with the brand name ""G-U-M"". The latter (newer design) has a smaller hole for the brush. Although smaller hole has the advantage of somewhat better rigidity, it does not allow deeper insertion of the Proxabrush refill. The brush stem loses its strength and breaks down sooner after repeated bending as a result of longer leverage. By the way, I prefer to use the ""cylindrical"" Proxabrushes and I do not understand why these cylindrical refills are no longer available in stores (e.g. Walmart and supermarkets). Why someone else (the manufacturer) should decide for me that I use the ""taper"" version only?"
1,Lousy design,This is a lousy design. The individual brushes are held in place by capture in the plastic head and they do not hold very well. I have to pull the brushes from my teeth as they frequently detach from the head. The individual go-betweens work very well so I will find the wider brushes for this application. The brushes have to be retreived from your teeth if you can find them. I would not recommend this product.
3,Smaller than I thought,"I have had trouble finding Proxabrushes in drug stores lately, so I thought I'd order on-line. ""Ultra-fine"" is very small and narrow - smaller that any I ever was able to get in a drug store. Since I ordered a lot, I will use them - but next time, I will be more careful about the size."
4,I like it a lot!!!!!!,I like this little organizer a lot on my visor. Not only does it add to the look of the interior a little bit but it can also hold your loose change and insurance/registration. Well worth the money!
3,adequate,"I bought these and 2 pair of Russell at the same time to compare. I found the Russell preferable with just a little softer material and seam stitching as well as little bit loose fit in the seat. Russell also has a printed logo compared to the embroidered Champion (which feels like a small hard scab on the otherwise soft material). These were comfortable and fit well and they've worn well for the last 4 months. For me though, I like the Russell slightly more."
3,Okay-ish,Very cheap. Only flaw is if you don't print for a few days the first page and a half is so blurry it's like trying to read after a night at the bar. Though it does clear up.
5,"Rocking C,S,N&Y","Crosby Stills Nash & Young made history in rockmusic when this double-LP was released. I think that most of us found CSN (&Y) great performers in the field of part-singing added a little electricity from Niel Young, but 4 Way Street presented a real spell-binding rockband - who could sing. I find that this release is the best CSN&Yproduction I've ever heard."
5,Best live album,"One of the all-time great live albums. It includes an unmatched live version of ""Southern Man,"" which features brilliant guitar riffs."
2,Poor quality digital,"The sound of this CD is harsh and at times painful, ironic considering that back in its day this was a demo record at most HiFi stores. Considering the $20 price for a 40 yr old recording I expected a quality, up up date digital to analogue remaster, sadly it's not the case here. And the music industry execs whine and complain how tough things are?"
4,this cd takes me back,"This CD takes me back to a time when this kind of heart-felt songwriting was all new to me. Just hearing the introductions to ""The Lee Shore"" and ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" can send shivers down my spine. I disagree with the reviewer who writes that songs like ""Chicago"" and ""Ohio"" are outdated; they stand up well as an example of songs written out of strong conviction. Putting ""Find the Cost of Freedom"" last is a good move; it brings the album to an appropriate close."
5,They should have stayed together.,This group is famous for their harmony. All from the best bands of the era when they united it was like magic. From Woodstock to now they've proved they've got it together and I believe they should have always stayed together.
4,Music Fan From PA said it all!,"... The album was made to be true to its time. Although I've always been a strongly devoted Neil Young fan, I enjoyed the days of the groups beginning as well as their separate albums which made their return to each other all the more sweet and defining. Especially, at 47, because I began listening and seeing them as a group much younger than a lot of my fellow concert fans and later, individually, when I was able to truly appreciate the music and the lyrics. It's great to be able to raise that one clinched hand and the other hand, with 2 fingers signifying the feeling (or rush that some others prefer,) felt at the end of every live song."
3,Mediocre When Compared to Their Other Efforts!,"I recently purchased this 2 CD set after not having heard it for a number of years. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. For some reason, they chose to showcase less Stills than the other three members, and the overall attempt suffers greatly as a result. I'm sorry, but Nash and Crosby have never been strong songwriters OR musicians, and are at their best when providing strong backup to Stills and Young. Also, why in the world they chose to put a lousy 30 seconds of ""Suite, Judy Blue Eyes"" as an intro only is anybody's guess."
2,Neil Young's contribution,"An interesting album although there is precious little of the wonderful harmonies associated with Crosby Stills and Nash. There are rather too many solo performances from this talented band. Neil Young's main contribution to this band's large portfolio is his harmony blends. Unfortunately his solo and, after a while, rather whining sounding voice becomes a little wearing after two or three songs. Nevertheless for fans of CSandN this live album is worth adding to the collection."
3,Acoustic heaven,"4-Way Street is an album that I've come back to after 20 years. I was curious to see what it sounded like today. Well, this album is divided into an acoustic set and an electric set. It was the acoustic side of the band that I have the fondest memories of, particularly David Crosby's 'Traid', the spine-tingling 'Lee Shore' and Graham Nash's 'Right Between the Eyes'. These songs still sound great - worth buying the record for alone, not forgetting Neil Young's acoustic contribution, 'Cowgirl in the Sand' (Neil comes off the best actually. His voice and style are so distinctive). The electric set is rather loose and some of it consists of pointless jamming so two stars off for that. The rest is superb. The stuff of really fond memories."
2,Could have been better,"I bought the original ablum back in the 70's. The sound quality was not very good. The ""enhanced"" and remastered CD is not much better."
2,Not what I expected,"I have two major problems with this album. The first problem is a weird one - the first song, Suite Judy Blue Eyes, isn't actually on the CD. It is listed as Track 1, but Track 1 is 26 seconds long, the first 8 seconds are silence, and the remainder is the very end of Suite Judy Blue Eyes (""da da da da da... da da da da da""), and that's it! It is so bizarre, I am not sure how they can list it as a track.The second is that I feel that many of the songs are played very sloppy. There is also a lot of talking before some of the songs (OK if you are actually at a concert, but not exactly what I want to hear on a CD)."
5,Quentissential CSN&Y,"Beautiful lyrics bring back the old days. This is a great collection..I would recommend to anyone, young or old.Crosby Stills Nas and Young was one of the most influential bands of the late 60's, early 70's and throughout the decades, their music is still appreciated and purchased worldwide!"
3,Starts strong,"Good album. They do most of the classics, but everybody's voices get pretty tired by the time they get to Carry On."
4,"Good live album, but help me please with one question ....","Did this 30-second version of ""Suite Judy Blue Eyes"" appear on the original vinly LP version back in 1971? Or is it just like that on this CD version?Thanks."
4,"The original unplugged, CSN and sometimes Y live,","The major disappointment for me is the 1st 30 seconds of the cd which is actually the last 30 seconds of ""Suite Judy Blue Eyes""....but other than that, this is an excellent live release with great music, nice harmony, and a bit of humor. The addition of Neil Young provides some raw moments and he is truly one of the highlights on this cd. Nothing else is missing here, you get the ""live"" performance as it is/was and you will enjoy it."
4,"Warts 'n all, it still delivers.","No one's going to get an argument from me if they say that there are several moments on here that could've been dispensed with. Steve Stills entire ""49 Bye-Byes/America's Children"" noise rant sounded stupid back then and still does (and I LIKE Stills!)and the ""electric"" portion of this set never quite catches fire. But with the exception of Still's solo moment, the entire first disc is a winner. Crosby's ""Lee Shore"" remain's captivating after all this time and the addition of Stills' ""Black Queen"" to this release gains back some of the ground Stills lost with ""49 Bye-Byes."" Neil Young's contributions remain the strongest here, both in his solo sections and when the four team up on the Buffalo Springfield-era ""On The Way Home."" The addition of Nash's ""King Midas In Reverse"" serves as a good reminder that Nash is not always the lightweight he appears--the version here is a winner.This is not a great live album, but it has its moments and that's enough."
5,One of the best live efforts by a lengendary group,One of the great live albums. The special chemistry of the group and crowd reactions really brought out their best effort. A beautiful blend of acoustic numbers followed by the electric powered rockers helped define their generation. The political statements are numerous and fit in with those troublesome times. The singing is inspiring and the lyrics are powerful and backed by great musicianship.
4,Nice but adds nothing to the studio versions,"Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young/ 4 way Street: I've always liked this double album but it's not the great live set we hoped it would be. There are a few fine performances here but most of the concert fails to add anything new to the studio releases. I like it so I give it four stars."
3,About the Middle - Little Heaven & Little Hell,"At this time (October 11, 2012), there are 80 - 4 and 5 star reviews. There are 15 or so 3 stars or below ratings.This album has several high points. This album has a number of WTF moments (there are moments in this album that make me cringe). Overall, I think one cd would have made for a stronger album.I am a fan of the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, the Hollies and C.S.N.&Y.;, but 5 stars is unjustified.3 stars is more than fair."
5,CSNY,"Always one of my favorite album; a pleasure to play it on vinyl!I got it fast and in great condition, thank you!"
2,Did not age well...,"Your vinyl copy is all used up sitting in a box in the basement, so this is one of the albums you decide to get on CD because it is one of those records you have real fine memories of from back in school. But man o man, when you play it back now, you realize it is one of those albums that does not age well at all. As stated in other reviews, very uneven performances (thank god for remotes and CD track programming). But I must be honest and say that I find that after the first listen or two, I almost never go back and pick out this CD to play, even when in a nostalgic mood and looking for something different to listen to. Wish I hadnt bought it. Let sleeping dogs lie and spend your money on something else."
3,This is New?,"I'm Sorry, This is great music but NEW is not the label that should be applied. Re-Package is the applicable term.This was truly inspirational music 35 years ago which, sadly still rings true today. If you do not have the originals then by all means this is a wonderful collection, go for it."
3,"Great story, some dull spots.","This is a compelling story, as I expect from Stabenow. Sort of a Kate Shugak in space. The ending is intensely memorable. The story contains straightforward and intense relationships, and a plot that draws one in. But then the story slams into an almost impenetrable morass of technical description, explaining in eye-crossing detail how the physical plant is designed and functions. This may be fascinating to the theoretical science buffs, but for me it was a repeated and annoying delay in the action. Perhaps, having fully set up her world, in the next book she will not find the need to go into such detail."
1,Unreadable,I could not read the book. It just kept going on and on about nothing. I understand story building but this was just nonsensical babbling. I hate to write harsh reviews but when I see some many good reviews I have to ask my self why. At least I know why the book was free. Don't waist your time.
4,Excellent story,"While not a new idea, large self sustained crafts that can be used for space habitats is a very Interesting concept.Arthur C Clark hit on this inRendezvous with Ramaand the subsequent stories that followed (as did many other authors)The book is well written and the story flows very smoothly.The author's style reminds me of Arthur HaleyHotel- - - The leader of a large project, overworked and constantly bombarded with problems while trying to juggle her own personal life.I really can't find anything negative to say about the book.So why only 4 stars instead of 5?I am not sure but for some reason I just could not bring myself to hit that 5th star.I can honestly say I enjoyed this book and can't wait to read the rest of the series.I will come back to this review later after I have read the rest of the series and will either give it the 5th star or explain why I am leaving it at 4."
1,very boring,"I found this book to be too boring to even finish. Although free, it is not worth downloading. It has no new ideas or plots to offer."
1,Hair on fire,"I managed to get through 45% of this book before I realized I would rather set my hair on fire (if I had any) than go back and read any more.So far, at 45%, there was no story. There were characters by the dozens, each with a contrived space type name like:Yelena Bugolubovo,Nierbog,Veblen, etc etc.Some of them were described with square heads, and some were huge, from other planets all settling on this space city.I was so frustrated by ill-defined characters, and the number of them without giving me a picture for my mind to grasp, that I had had enough/Maybe there's a story line, you know; good guys vs bad guys somewhere later on, but a book, a play, a movie, should entertain.This book missed the mark for me.You can obtain it at no cost, but that's about what it's worth in my humble opinion.Sorry to be so strong about it, but honesty is better than false diplomacy.Fred Auerbach"
2,Meh...,"Oh my. No plot, no problem? Trying to be Asimov or Heinlein without the machismo? Ancient science? Strong Fem main character seemed only to be impressed with her own mind. Only one character I liked and she came and went somewhere about 70% into the book. I gave an extra point for trying to be a sci-fi. Sorry. Wish I could say more for it. I wanted to be able to share this with my sci-fi friends but nah. Don't bother."
3,Interesting premise,I have read other Dana Stabenow books and found this book interesting. I still prefer the Kate Shugak and Liam Campbell characters.
3,Classic SF,"Given that I grew up in the days when the Russians (or Soviets) were a driving force, this novel felt familiar. This is basically an alternate future book, where a message from space shows that Aliens are out there and motivates the world to head outwards to greet those aliens on a more equal footing.Star is basically a construction manager / captain of the still developing L5 community being put together by the Western alliance (US, Japan, Mexico, Canada) on a grand scale (miles long rotating habitat meant to house 1 million people? That's the definition of grand scale!). Of course, there are a lot of issues. The potential of a hostile takeover, construction delays, solar flares and, yes, aliens all make this book an entertaining read.Amazingly for a book written 2 decades ago, the book holds up fairly well (other than the geo-political aspects). I had to go back see when it was written and was quite surprised at the date."
3,Is this where we are headed?,It took forever to get into it but I kept plodding along and it got very interesting at the end. I don't think I'll buy the next ones tho just in case they are slow getting started.
1,Disappointed,"I am a big fan of Dana Stabenow's books and I like science fiction, but I could not get past the third chapter. Very disappointed"
2,"Good Fun, Bad Movie","2 stars for being so bad, it's good. I have only seen this on video but the movie is so bad---it's funny. There are a great deal of sequences involving walking through semi-woods on an island. There are also a great deal of boat sequences. A character gets shot and gives a standout performance of, well, ""play dying"" and there is an unbelieveable fight sequence at the end which looks more like the characters are play wrestling with each other. The sound is awful but the movie was made that way. The sound echoes around in many scenes but one scene in the lobby of someone's house (?) has the worst sound of any movie ever. This movie begs to be put on MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE if they were still making those, which they should."
3,Don Sullivan Lives!!,"A group of teenagers happen upon an island inhabited by Katherine Victor as the sociopathic, Vampira-esque mad scientist ""Doctor Myrna""; and her zombie horde. The kids have stumbled into a subversive plot to turn the world into a planet of zombie slaves! Evil Dr. Myrna has concocted a gas that turns people into cabbage-heads. The teenagers show up just in time to mess things up royally! Don (Giant Gila Monster) Sullivan is the only teenager with gray matter in his skull. Thank God he doesn't sing or play the ""banjo-lele"" in this one!! Anyway, together, the dopey teens escape, and with the help of a man in an ultra-cheap gorilla suit, Dr. Myrna is vanquished. A personal favorite..."
3,Jerry Warren snoozer comes to DVD,"Some of Jerry Warren's films are so bad, they are barely watchable. This is exactly the case for Teenage Zombies. Give credit to Retromedia for doing a good job on this release. The bonus materials are good. There are interviews with Ivan the Zombie and Dr. Myra (Katherine Victor). The rerelease trailer (Teenage Terror) is included, which is cool. Fred Olen Ray does a cool intro to the movie, although keep the kids away (nudity).The movie transfer itself, however, is disappointing. The original used for the transfer could have been in better shape. There are some annoying vertical lines in the early part of the film. The sound is poor, but this is a problem with the original film and not the DVD. It's irritating, but then so is watching this film (blame Jerry Warren). I probably would not buy again. It would have been better if with its original doublebill, The Incredible Petrified World."
4,Isis for today,Felt that this book is very good for Pagans and Witches who are trying to establish a good relationship with Isis/Ausset as well as other Egyptian pantheon Gods. I brioefly met Ms. Reed in 1999 and this book represents Her spirit (Ms. Reed)
1,"A reprint of an older book, and a not very good one at that.","This is actually a revision of an earlier book of hers called ""Invocation of the Gods"". Unfortunately, this was not indicated anywhere that I saw on the Amazon site, so I ended up buying a book that I already own. I was hoping for a more, well rounded,book on Egyptian Pagan rituals this time. Sadly, this was not the case with this book. It's hardly surprising though, as Llewellyn Publications, the book's publisher, has a history of reissuing their ""under-performing"" books under new titles. It's gotten to the point that if I pick up a book in a store, and I see their logo, I just put it right back. Considering how few books there are out there on Egyptian Paganism, I'd like to recommend this one, but, I can't."
1,Ow!,"While the book is full of information, it is one of the worst written books I have read in my adult life. Ms. Reed's commentaries are, at times, preachy, conversational, defensive, and condescending. It's a very difficult read for someone looking for a scholarly text. Were I not as interested in the subject as I and hoping to glean some insites, I would have simply written down her references and read those books instead."
2,"Pretty obvious, formula-driven, consultant-speak stuff.","Sort of like a combination of ""In Search of Excellence"" and in search of flatulence -- companies that win and companies that lay an egg. All this 1-2-3 wave business can make you seasick. Basically it would make a good set of business school cases. But the cases don't really fit into an overarching framework that has the explanatory power Morrison pretends"
2,A Huge Disappointment,"The Game of Life: Simpson's Edition is a failure of concept and design. The quality of the game is so low as to be almost nonexistent. The board and the spinner are terminally flimsy--the spinner almost being useless it is so unsmooth and rickety. To require assembly of all the houses and everything every time one plays the game is a slight against anyone with patience or capacity for joy. The game itself isn't very fun--differing from classic Life, in that its not very fun. I love the Simpson's. I hate this game. With my whole heart."
2,Do NOT pay full price!,"I feel like I always get a lot out of the games I buy b/c we MAKE them fun even if they are duds. We alter the rules to suit us. For ex, we often make a kid and teen/adult team so the little ones can play along too.This game is very cheaply made. (95% of Simpson products are the same. Those Krusty product jokes must be based on the real Simpsons merchandise.)It takes a long time to set up and disassemble the plastic pieces for each game. Your token is still the classic Life car with the colored pegs. Come'on, couldn't they have done better?Life is a bit of difficult game b/c it's harder for children to understand and by the time they do, they probably won't want to play. Adults are unlikely to enjoy the novelty of bills, etc b/c that's their everyday life."
5,Heartwarming,"This is a wonderful movie! I was at a store that sells discounted movies(sorry Amazon)! I just picked it up and thought ok I'll buy it. I Fell in LOVE with this movie! It's an older movie for sure, but It does not matter. If you like cute feel good movies this is for you! I just love the little actress Connie Carol. I think this was her only film:( It starts off with Don Gregorio,a hopeless alcoholic janitor. At his lowest point the sweet Angel appears. Then he has the Devil& an Angel on his journey. If you want a good ole'feel good movie to watch on a rainy day,this is a great one! I also recommend ""A Little Romance"" Starring Diane Lane. She was just a teen when she acted in the movie. This is a keeper also!!ENJOY!!"
2,eh...,Does not last as long as the OEM battery under any condition. Still useful to have around as a backup though.
5,Can't beat the price,Even though the s/h was several times the item price this was a great value. My last aftermarket battery (that I paid $[...] for with the camera) crapped out and stopped taking a charge. I was very pleased to find this battery at this price. Thank you Amazon for leading us to this vendor.*******************************************************************I've been using this battery for 2 years and it has worked as well as the original Nikon battery that came with the camera. What else can you ask for?
4,works great,"So far, this battery appears to work as well as the OEM battery that came with the camera."
1,Digital Concepts Battery Equivelent to Nikon EN-EL 5 1100MAH Lithium Ion Battery,"I bought two of these batteries. One required eight hours to fully charge, the other would not accept a charge. I would not recommend this battery."
3,Author needs to review this book for correctness.,"I have just completed a course in Basic Nursing using Potter and Perry's Basic Nursing : Essentials for Practice and used the suggested study guide by Castaldi. I would inform you that we (our class) discovered errors on numerous occassions in the study guide text that need to be addressed/corrected by the author. These primarily pertained to answers for some of the practice questions. The instructors at our school contacted the publisher and were told that they were aware of the situation and attempted to help by posting the corrections on a website. However, this didn't happen before we completed the course. On a positive note I would say that aside from some frustrations I found the study guide to be quite helpful with my studies."
2,Dissapointed,"This textbook was necessary for my first nursing semester. Nothing could have been worse than start with this book. It has long, lengthy, wordy chapters about nothing. And what was the most devastating for me is that it gives you discordant information, probably taken from different sources meaning authors didn't even bother to put the given data all together. I end up buying another book that our school used couple of years before in the first semester (Saunders: Fundamentals of Nursing) which worked perfect for me."
4,Very Pleased,I was Very pleased with this purchase. The book arrived sooner than I expected and was in excellent condition. I have no complaints about the porduct nor the company.
5,BASIC NURSING TEXT,RECEIVED EARLIER THAN EXPECTED. VERY PLEASED. WILL DEFINITELY DEAL WITH THE SELLER AGAIN IF OTHER NEEDED PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE.
5,Great for first time readers of the Bible,"This is not meant to be a study Bible. This is meant to be a Bible that gets people, who would normally not read the Bible, reading the Bible. My daughter's boyfriend read this from cover to cover and LOVED it. He had never read the Bible before. This got him interested and understanding things in his own language and now he is ready to switch to a study Bible. I heard the author speak many years ago and he explained that this was not a ""translation"" it was a paraphrase much like the Message."
4,Question...,"So, then, is it an abomination to translate the Scriptures into, say, Hindi or Chichewa or Sinhalese? Do not those folks deserve to hear the Good News and should they not be given the chance to read God's Word in their own tongue?Why, then, do people continue to make such a tiresome case for the KJV - IT'S NOT EVEN IN OUR LANGUAGE!!! Don't 21st century English-speaking folks have just as much right to hear the Gospel in THEIR own language?I'm so sick to death of this whole King James argument - why don't you leave your idol behind and start living the Word and loving people!"
2,Very disappointed,"It sounded like it would be a different take on the Bible, easier to read and enjoy. It wasn't. The British street slang was quite often unfathomable and the authenticity was woeful."
4,This is an excellent read :),Great Book. Many need assistance reading the Bible. This book is an excellent source for study and for learning. :)
3,Sheriff and the kid,I remembered this film in my childhood.The catchy soundtrack writed by the De Angelis brothers on the credits and the foolish acting by Spencer and the stunts.As all Italian productions in the US has the standard of all the flicks like this.An alien kid played by Cary Guffey(the kid of Spielberg's Close Encounters in The Third Kind)is left on Earth by an UFO.Newnan Sheriff played by grizzly Spencer founds it and he must protect him from the military air force coast guard inepts led by Capt Briggs.The fight scenes are standard in all Spencer films.His English spelling denotes his italian accent.I passed a good time watching it.
4,Great movie,"While this isn't some big budget movie with big hollywood movie stars, the film is actually decent. The entire time watching it, I felt it was very similar to watching a play. If you're a Bay Area native you'll notice some of the locations where the movie was filmed. The whole bit about Napoleon's penis was hilarious. This movie is snarky in a way that many might not be able to appreciate. I say it's going to be a cult classic!"
2,Must be a plot in here somewhere,"Only a good investigator could find the plot here. It is buried under tons of ridiculously minute, nearly endless descriptions of clothes, faces, driveways, mailboxes, front doors, and on and on and on. I know the series gets better, but this one is a smothered dud."
3,The Snatch,Pronzini loses a little on this one. While I enjoyed the trip around San Francisco the characters seemed thin and the blown kidnapped caper did not pass the reality test for me.Cop Shop
3,From PBS to my CD player...,"I heard the Corrs PBS concert a year or two ago, and was transfixed. Talk on Corners captures some of that feeling, especially Andrea Corrs incredible, evocative voice. What I miss (and this is nitpicking) is some better sound quality (it's all over the place on this CD) and a stronger rhythm section. The drum work is not quite where it could be, and the bass playing is a touch uninventive. However, the music, and the CD in general, is worth buying, for such gems as the usually-not-talked-about 'Little Wing' (wow, prob. my fave track) and good remixes of 'What Can I Do' and 'Runaway', plus 'Hopelessly Addicted'."
2,"Hey everbody, its the Love Boat!","This is a disappointment in the fact that the group surrenders its distinctive acoustic Celtic sound (aptly displayed in live appearances) for the gloss of overproduction. This Chicago meets the Chieftains combo comes across like trying to see the Love Boat through the glare of sunlight reflecting off of Gavin McCleod's head. Put the Captain's hat back on! See them live when they tour.I am glad they took the original Talk On Corners off the shelf, though. It might make my CD a collector's item."
5,Terrific album,"The Corrs are a great band that have the knack of integrating modern rock, pop and dance music with a traditional celtic beat. They have written or co-written 12 of the 15 songs on this album,..they are a true musical talent and can do it all. I am not sure why there seem to be so many editions of this album, but this is the one that I have, and I highly recommend it. Each and every track is good, and the 16 page booklet contains all lyrics and photos of the group. The album also has an instrumental ""Paddy McCarthy"" which is wonderful with its Celtic sounds."
3,"Some remixes are good, but...","...buy the original ""Talk On Corners"" instead. I must admit I actually like the ""What Can I Do"", ""So Young"" and ""I Never Loved You Anyway"" remixes...but those of ""Dreams"" and ""Runaway"" makes you wanna scream and run out of the room. Then, all the other tracks are the same ones as on the original ""TOC"" cd."
4,A GREAT LISTEN,This cd was a little bit of a disapointment as dreams was a remix and a few other ones were as well. Never mind though a good cd all the way through with a bit of unreleased stuff on it! If you are a corrs fan go and buy it now but you would be better off buying the corrs cd with no remix's' on it (special edition I think). PRETTY GOOD OVERALL!!!!!!!!!
4,The Corrs are awesome!,"The Corrs are a young and talented band. Their music has a great uplifting spirit which will brighten your day. I just wish that they stick to their Celtic sound and don't head to where other 1990's artists end up: forgotten and in the bargain bin. If they stick to their unique sound, they will stick around."
1,1.5 Stars,"I got this CD when I first heard ""So Young"", a good song. Unfortunately for me, that's it! The rest of the CD is quite dissapointing, and too much of it is too instrumental. If you like instrumental stuff, you might like the CD. If not, I'd stay away... one of the few CDs I have which wasn't worth getting."
1,The Corrs make me sick,"Hey, this is not a pop-rock band. They're a pretty faces band. Handred percent of false music, standard production. Give hamburgers to the masses..."
1,clones,"the corrs embody all that is wrong with music in the late 20th century. lift music written by three gorgeous clones...oh and some bloke. drippy pap, no tune, no talent."
2,Listen to it before you buy!,"The comparison I keep coming across to Wilson Philips is all too true. Most of the tunes on this album start to wear on the brain after a second or third listening. Part of the reason for this is the noticeable absence of anything pioneering or new. Their attempt at intermingling traditional Irish music with pop is promising on tracks such as ""dreams,"" but the rest of the album leaves me desiring more. The fantastic remixes of ""so young"" and ""dreams"" proves this band needs an infusion of some upbeat music to spice up what I would catagorize as an older, wilson philips era, sound."
3,"The Corrs are great, but this CD was not.","After flipping for ""Forgiven, Not Forgotten"", I looked forward to getting into ""Talk on Corners"". I was a bit dissappointed. The rich textures seemed to be missing and the sweet harmonies seemed to be minimized somewhat. The Corrs rendition of the Fleetwood Mac tune ""Dreams"" was monotonous and boring, but I have to admit I didn't like the original much, either. ""Runaway"" was much better on ""Forgiven....""All in all, the Corrs are a great band. I expect better things from them in the future."
1,Sheer Butchery,"Who is the genius responsible for this horrid little project? These ""re-mixes"" are nothing but techno-vandalism. Excellent songs and performances have been drowned in layers of clumsy, plastic, phony, synthesized [junk], reducing them to the level of the rest of the meaningless, mechanical disco garbage which is already out there in abundance. The record company should never have allowed this mess to be released. It also reflects poorly on the Corrs that they permitted this to happen. This band deserves better, and so do their fans..."
5,Simply Superb,I bought this CD last year and I really loved it. This is the second one I am buying ie the Special Edition. Corrs are just unique and they are great.
3,Where did the Irish soul go?,"I have to say first, it's still good CD but not great. Is the Corrs originality in the mixed sense of traditional Irish music and temporality? At least, I believed so. It left me an impression that they cared about American market too much. But again, this CD is still good. Still successful."
5,No. 1!,"The Corrs' ""Talk on Corners"" offers songs which refresh the mind. This is seen with their use of strings in most of their songs, and this makes them different from other pop groups. Their songs and melodies are easy to memorize; these plus their beauty adds to the group's charisma. My favorites are ""Runaway"", ""Talk on Corners"", and ""Queen of Hollywood"". Don't get me wrong, the other songs are just as great! Buy this CD and you'll be glad you did. A treasure of a CD!"
4,Celtic music meets Top 40 pop,"This is not the version I own, but close enough. The Corrs are a fun, talented bunch blending traditional Irish sounds with modern themes and production. ""What Can I Do"" was a popular single for a reason, and the remake of ""Dreams"" is even better.Repetition is the biggest sin committed by The Corrs, and I don't mean different remixes of the same song. Toward the end of any version of Talk on Corners the lyrics begin to get tired. A little more depth is called for, and one can only hope that the familial group will explore the ""storytelling"" format (above and beyond ""Queen of Hollywood"") as an alternative to the same old vague love lyrics that any young pop artist can churn out.Still, The Corrs stand out as a musical act due to their skillful melding of the tin whistle, bodhran, and violin into sweet and sometimes catchy tunes. Definitely worth a listen."
2,"Forgotten, Not Forgiven","I anticipated much after thoroughly enjoying ""Forgiven, Not Forgotten"", but found this 90% techno-pop fluff, 10% Irish hodge-podge to be a major letdown. If I had wanted this sort of sound, I would have dragged out my old Pet Shop Boys anthology, copied it onto reel-to-reel and sped it up. And what's with this airheaded rendition of ""Dreams""? Geez, let Fleetwood Mac rest in peace! I didn't hear the ""non-special edition"", but feel sure that it must have been better than this mess. Sorry Corrs, I'll have to label this one ""Forgotten, Not Forgiven."" Next time, have your minds in Ireland, not the disco."
2,Oh geez!,"Yet more pathetic love songs! The vocals are great , Sharon Corr just plain kicks arse with that violin, and some of the music is ok. But I just can't stand that 'What can I do to make you love me?' (yikes) sap. It's horrible. I think The Corrs are a very talented band, but please, the sap really has to go!"
5,Wonderful CD!,"I saw The Corrs on Saturday Night Live and a few talk shows, and thought they were great! I got the CD for my birthday, and listen to it a lot. My favorite song is ""Runaway"". Unfortunately, none of my friends at school know how great they are. I hope they make it big in America too."
5,A cross between Fleetwood Mac and The Chieftains,"If the musical gods crossed Fleetwood Mac and The Chieftains they would have created The Corrs. I am enchanted with their celtic rhythms, their three-part harmonies, and Andrea's angelic solos. All three women are as musically talented as they are beautiful. I'm sure Jim is talented too, but he's not my type. This group's star is definitely rising."
1,Very Very Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this album. All the tracks were horrible. I saw them on SNL and went to buy the CD. After listening to it I returned it back to the store. The first album was much better.
2,A disappointing follow-up,"A unique sound was captured on the Corrs debut album 'Forgiven not Forgotten' - a blend of traditional and modern irish. Who could argue that the album was brilliant. When 'Talk on Corners' was released I held off purchasing it for awhile after reading many disappointing reviews. By the time I did buy it, I was fortunate to get a copy with 'Dreams' included and the remix of 'What Can I Do'. The album has since been repackaged again with further remixes. 'Talk on Corners' lacks the creativity of the debut album and it is almost as if the Corrs decided to play it 'safe'. Predictable tracks are found on this CD including 'Only When I Sleep' and 'So Young'. Unfortunately the special irish sound that was their trademark is lost."
1,Too much bubble gum pop and not enough Irish soul.,"I bought this CD after catching the very end of a special I saw on TV. They ended their set with a rousing version of a traditional sounding Irish melody. Unfortunetly this CD is neither rousing nor particularly Irish sounding, unless you think that Dave Mathews Band sounds Irish because of the electric violin. I'm listening to the 2nd cover song on the album as I write this and I'm shocked to hear them perform ""Little Wing"" so poorly. They'd do better to hire a writer and perhaps a manager who would steer them clear of making such a huge mistake as covering a Jimi Hendrix song when they lack the chops to bring it off. Come on Corrs I 'm pulling for you. Try again and next time don't worry about making a pop album. Make a good album."
5,Of all the Coors albums--buy this one...,"I got this album without realizing it was a remix. As soon as I got it at home, I saw, and had a sinking feeling... REMIX? Yuch... One time in the ol' CD player and I was cured though--because it was absolutely great! I immediately bought the non-remix version and I am completely unimpressed by it.... I have all their albums--and I'd say if you are just getting into the Coors--try this first! You'll love it. If you don't love it--likely you won't enjoy the others much either. Although I never thought I'd say it--the remix version rocks!"
5,The most excellent music I had never heard before,"I heard this band on imagineradio.com and it was great. I heard ""I never really loved you anyway"" and thought...hmm, what's this?So, I took a chance and got the cd. It's absolutely fabulous. The irish rhythms combined with cool soul searching lyrics just blew me away. It reminds me of Loreena McKennitt meets Jennifer Paige in an irish pub with free drinks.Definately a keeper."
5,Ther Corrs are spectacular!,"The day I got this cd I listened to the whole thing and liked every single song! That's pretty unusual actually very unusual for me! This cd is awesome as are The Corrs! If you don't have it get it! Also check out Forgiven, Not Forgotten, The original Talk On Corners and The Corrs live! You'll be satisified you did!"
5,"Wonderful album, why aren't they more popular?",Every song on this album is great! I can't understand why the Corrs are not more popular here in the US. This CD is absolutely wonderful!
4,I love their album!,"I can hear it many times as I want to! But unfortunately, I just borrowed it but trying to buy myself one. But it's still the great album! I like Andrea and her voice!"
5,Greatest Cd I have,"This cd rocks!! I love their first cd and this is a good follow up! there is a version of ""Runaway"" with out the piano on it and I personaly like this version better than the one on ""Forgiven Not Fogotten"". I love how Andrea, Sharon, Caroline and Jim's voices blend together. I think that all of you should by this cd wheather you like Irish music or not because there is something for everybody!"
5,Go get this cd!!,"Everyone should get this album it is amazing. I first heard of them reading about them in Smash Hits magazines and Top of the Pops. Then I saw them on SNL and thought they were amazing, I went to buy their album not thinking I would like it all that much and to my surprise I really did. I love all the songs. Its great!!"
2,Popachicky music with a fiddle thrown in for atmosphere,Typical 90's pop. There is not one distinctive or strong voice to be found. The music is highly derivative and the recording is over produced. I'll stick with Solas thank you.
5,I hope the image won't control the music...,"Talk on Corners is my introduction to the Corrs, and I'm in love with the ballads and the strong Irish roots in this music. My personal favorite is ""Runaway;"" the sweetness of the strings and the lead singer's voice send me into a daydream...but as the band's ambition to make it in America grows, I do worry that the soulful Irish emotion will be covered with Hollywood's sultry, sugary packaging aimed at the fantasies of a young, pop-consuming audience. The CD cover photos emphasize the band's new, glossy look (just compare it to the cover of ""Forgiven...not Forgotten"")...and while there's nothing wrong with ""lookin' good,"" it's ""playin' good"" that counts!"
2,A major disappointment after their previous album....,"Being a total fan of the Celtic pop of ""Forgiven, Not Forgotten"" I was fondly looking forward to the Corrs' new album. Unfortunately, the atmospheric Irish sound of their first album has been replaced with an edge-less rock ""attitude."" Gone are the wonderful Celtic instrumental tunes and the moody lyrics that made ""Forgiven"" such a standout. ""Talk on Corners"" is not a bad album, but it has little of the spirit of their previous effort. I can't help but wonder if the simple fact that there is already a ""special edition"" of the new album proves that the previous version was seen as somehow lacking....but the revised edition doesn't seem to be an improvement. Sorry, but based on this one, I'll test-drive their next release before I commit my money to it."
2,could've been better,"The vocals are great, and the music is really nice for the most part. The Celtic flavour is wonderful but tragically diluted with overproduction. What a crime to wash out those string instruments! The production does nothing to their music save for making it sound a whole lot more like everybody else's."
3,Not as good as on TV,"I originally saw them on SNL. I really enjoyed thier song ""What can I do"". But the song is played differently on the CD from how they have played it on SNL (Saturday Night Live), The Today Show and Rosie. All of the songs sound pretty much the same... I would recommend waiting awhile until you can borrow the CD from a friend and then listen to it to see if you really like it."
5,Excellent,"I first discovered The Corrs in Aug. of 1996 when I saw them open for Celine Dion. A few days later , I bought ""Forgiven, Not Forgotten"", which is a great album. The continue to not disapoint both with the original ""Talk on Corners"" and the new special edition. I hope they get the success here in the States they have gotten elsewhere in the world."
5,THE modern primer to gun ownership!!,"Boston on Guns & Courage seems to pick up where Mel Tappan's Survival Guns left off (in the late 1970s). Boston T. Party (author of Good-Bye April 15th!, You & The Police!, Bulletproof Privacy, Hologram of Liberty, and Boston on Surviving Y2K) is extremely knowledgeable about firearms, not to mention a champion of the 2nd Amendment. This stirring book details which guns to own and which to avoid, gear, gun control laws (present and likely future), calibers, parts/gunsmithing sources, training, and safety. The last several chapters are wonderful essays: Wealth vs. Liberty, Preparing For The Worst, The Patriot Light!, and Outrage, Then Courage. I've read anything quite like this book. Every gunowner should have a copy!"
5,Boston Knows Guns,"Oh, so that's why I bought my FN-FAL. Good to know I'm so smart. Most of what you ever wanted to know about buying a gun or three or thirty for that ""rainy day"" sprinkled with a heavy dash of pioneer spirit. Very practical information, sound advice.I grow flush with fever as I move onto the next chapter in the book, ""Women and Guns."" Mmmm good."
5,nancy and plum,"i first read this book in the 4th grade, long ago, i have re-read it many many times and still love the story... is a very touching story with a happy ending, i have read it to many of my nephews and nieces............this is my favorite book in the whole world... and i have read many...."
5,Memorable after all these years,"I will be 50 years old next month and my sister just turned 60. Whenever we talk on the phone, we still discuss this book and how much we loved it. Sadly, our copy was lost about 30 years ago.I'll never forget when the nasty little girl got the ammonia spashed in her eyes!"
5,My favorite Childhood book,"Betty McDonald's ""Nansy and Plum"" was my favorite book when I was a young girl. The title in german was ""Hand in Hand der Sonne nach"" (Hand in hand following the sun) I must have read it 100 times. Now that my daughter is nine, and we are trying to set up a list for summer readings, I've remembered this book. The two orphan girls are strong, courageous, and together take their destiny in their hands. The boarding school director and her niece are delightefully wicked, and I remember ""living"" the girls anger and frustrations, as I shared their joy and triumph. The scene in the attic, when they find the empty boxes of two dolls that were sent as a present to Nancy and Pamela, and that Marybell (the niece) ""steals"", is unforgettable. I guaranty you are going to LOVE this book (and your daughter will too!)"
3,Too superficial,"The book is very entertaining and quite funny, but for anyone with more than high school chemistry and physics, it is too superficial. The author introduces only one formal concept in the whole book: ""molecules"" and does this in 4 lines after apologizing and promising not to do it again. If you know what a dipole, entropy or superficial tension is, this book is not for you. It might be great to get a young and interested kid going though."
3,Strictly for Non-scientists,"I'm afraid I was taken in by the title, which is deceptive. I'd be shocked if Einstein didn't actually know most of what is in this book. I only had my high-school chemistry, and 2 years of college physics, and I knew 90% of the facts presented in this book.The book is well written, and the descriptions are clear and accurate. It wasn't a painful read (taking me only 4 hours or so), and I'd reccomend it to my non-technical friends, but if you have a scientific mind and even a little training, don't bother. I was hoping for some more advanced stuff - that even Einstein didn't know."
4,funny wait to understand everyday issues,it explains in a comprehensive way everyday issues. It undoes many mysteries of many things we thought were difficult to understand...
4,Enjoyable read,I liked this book because I enjoy practical science and how things work. Fun read as are the others in the series. Might be good for children just starting to show interest in science.
4,Claudia works me over!!!!,"I really wanted to write this the day after I got the tape, because thats when my buns started getting sore. But, I held off for 2 weeks to get a real feel for the tape. Claudia's tape really does give a good toning workout for the buttocks area. It deffinatly doesn't do much cardio wise, unless you are a beginner. The only other bad thing is that my boyfriend claimed "" this tape isn't for girls it's for guys"", refering to the almost corny voice of Claudia's trainer coming from the back ground as Claudia does hip thrusts in spandex(lol). Overall, this tape does what it claims to do in a pretty quick and slightly painful way. I recommend it as an extra side workout for those already doing consistent cardio and strength workouts."
3,"good for your butt, not good for overall fitness",I have fitness videos from Elle Macpherson and Cindy Crawford and this one is not as much fun although it still does the job. I use this video when I don't feel like bouncing around as much. I prefer workout videos which are longer and cover the whole body without changing tapes all the time.
4,Very Good For the Beginner,"As a Pro Trainer, I always like to see programs for beginners - it is the population that needs the most help.The exercises are basic with basic variations - & quite convenient, another good factor for beginners who may be time challenged.Would like to see it in DVD if not yet available.Joey Atlas - The Wizard of Fitnesswww.ButtHipAndThighMakeover.comwww.AbsOfStoneCoreOfSteel.com"
5,Claudia Schiffer: Perfectly Fit - Buns,Bought just to have as part of my Cluadia Schiffer collection. I probably will never open it.
4,Good routine for the target area,"I really like this tape. About 30 minutes long, the tape starts with a warm-up, proceeds with the work out and finishes with stretches for the muscles that you just exercised. The main part of the work out cosists of about 5-6 different excersize series. Each of them is some variation of the old but proven lunges, squats, leg lifts and pelvic tilts. What is really helpful for me is that while there are not any ""revolutionary"" new exerices, I am forced to do all the repetitions--something that I do not have the discipline to do by looking at a magazine or going to the gym.My only issue with the tape is that Claudia does not have the controlled movements we are led to believe are safest and most effective."
4,Victor Smolski Is One Bad Bway On The Guitar,"While the vocals and guitar lines retain their trademark melodic sense, this album shows a heavier, harder, more straighforward Rage than their previous few efforts."
2,Jargony and too pat with high level abstractions,"The book is very abstract and jargony with Marxist undertones, but novel. Probably a ""must read"" in ""the literature"" but in reality not a very important book to have under one's belt"
3,wrong item,"We did not recieve the Pro Ice Original, It seems that the item number of a disimilar Mueller arm pack was similar to the Pro Ice Original so we recieved the Mueller instead which did not provide elbow protection, just shoulder. Vendor was very helpful he refunded us for the wrongly listed item."
5,Amazing,"I've heard Simon Phillips playing with Toto and studied his Videos but when I heard him playing on ""Another Lifetime"" I was amazed about his Drum-Kit sounding in a way I've newer heard before on a record. Now it sounds even more ""alive"" than it soundet on Symbiosis . This CD is a must for all Fusion lovers an drummers!"
1,Folows the tradition of most sequels,"Skip this, rent the original Witchboard. It's actually scary. I also suggest a couple of rounds on a Ouija board beforehand to liven things up.:)"
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Now, don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting Oscar calibur material, but a little effort on their part would have been appreciated. The acting was luke warm at best, but I have to admit they did they best they could with such a crummy script. My advice would be to move on to another video. You don't want to waste an hour and a half of your life watching this."
3,Worth it for Ami alone,"I picked up this movie mainly because I am a fan of Ami Dolenz.As a lover of occult movies, I think it stands up on its own. I found the movie to be tense and suspensful.Ami's performance as the skeptical girl turned turned believer in danger is great.I've watched the movie a few times since I got it and I think it would be a great movie to watch late at night or on a dark stormy afternoon.Another reviewer complained that it was unrealistic, but I have heard far stranger real life scary experiences than this, so even though its fiction, I don't find it out there at all.If you like occult or suspensful movies, pick this one up."
3,The First One Was Better,"When i heard they were making a sequal to Witchboard i was thrilled.Only to find out Tawny would not be in it.This film isnt as bad as some have said.Its actually funnier than scary.Bad acting,but good atmosphere.The atmosphere is spooky!!Witchboard 2 is like one of the corny 50s/60s horror flick its so bad its good.Skip the 3rd Witchboard,it has to be the worst movie i have seen.Some people know how to kill a good series."
4,awesome!,"i do admit,there were a couple of problems with this film.it was a little corny BUT a little scary.good enough to buy still.It's not really that different than any other scary movie.average amount of scary parts and violence."
1,"Beautiful ring leaves nasty ""ring""","I bought this ring because I thought it was beautiful. Turns out, it turns my finger green and I cannot wear it. I wore it a total of a few days before I saw the green appearing and it made me very angry. I knew it wasn't white gold when I ordered it, but I thought that only bubble gum machine rings turned fingers green... I guess not."
3,Good movie for the price,This movie follows the typical plot of train to inflick pain on someone who did you wrong the opening fight scene is good as well the ending there's a lot of silly kung fu here but the few good scenes help not to make this film a total waste.
2,horrible movie,"I mean we get a decent fight at the start but the lead actor should not have been in the movie at all. he is so hard to look at, I thought he was just gonna shrivel up and die. One of my favs Hwang Jang lee(aka wong cheng li, aka the silver fox) plays the bad guy and I am warning you, do not watch this. The only reason it gets a second star is because you have to giev it a 1 at leasst you can rate a movie on this site and the final fight had some excellent kicking. The hero finally has a pre final fight where I saw a few good kicks but then the end they must have spent like a whole day on that. Hwang and teh ugly guy kick eachother about 100 times inthe finale.DVD quality-poor, full screened, but watchableSpecial features-you put the disc in and it plays, if you forget to turn it off it will just loop. HA HA."
5,Resourceful,"Just have a look at the first chapter and you will understand what I mean: ""How to manage the boss"""
2,Not Durable,"it is good for walking on Ice and it won't ruin flooring, but it broke after wearing it once. The rubber is thin and not durable. Try Get-a-GRIP ICE CLEATS."
1,Glad I Sold It For a Few Bucks,"I got this CD back when it came out. I belonged to a CD club, and I think by buying this CD dirt cheap (as a featured selection or special offer), I got to pick a second CD (or more) of my choice either for free or for a buck or two.I gave it a listen, and was supremely bored by it, so I sold it to a sax-playing friend of mine for a few bucks.I listened to the song samples just now, and I'm glad I sold it. Sorry. This is little more than bland background music. It sounds boring, tame, and predictable.Give me Coltrane, Jaco, Ornette Coleman, Oscar Peterson, or Slayer, Tori Amos, Tarja, Mr. Bungle or Primus.Those are just a few of the many artists I like, spanning many genres.I like music that's challenging, that burns with passion and rage...and this is very, very far from it.As the saying goes, ""to each his own."" But it's a fact that Boney James is a smooth jazzer, and smooth jazz is, by and large, very banal and lifeless.If I could give this zero stars, I would."
4,"good music, but",I really like Boney's style.....but one thing keeps me from purchasing this cd. The cover of the cd isn't 'family friendly'. :)
5,*Captivating*,"First of all, Boney James should not be compared to Kenny G at any time for any reason. He clearly deserves better. This CD is simply captivating. Boney clearly exhibits all of his talent, creativity, and artistry in every song. Just listen to those sweet flutters and flurries in the song ""Body Language"" which is sultry and seductive, to the passionite groove of Boney's Saxophone conversation with Rick Braun's Horn on ""Boneyizm."" Take a chance and get ""Into The Blue."" This song which is full of R&B, Soul, and Rock is going to keep this CD in the top 10 for a very, very long time. It has the best mixture of Saxophone, piano and drums. Boney is consistent throughout the CD. Every song is performed purely from the heart. The song ""All Night Long"" will only remind you to hit the repeat button several more times. There is a wonderful blend of talent that will be found in every song. This is a great CD for any Smooth Jazz fan. Boney's style will sneak up on you and it will never leave."
5,Contemporary Jazz at it's Finest!,"If you like a mixture of soothing jazz with contemporary jazz, you MUST get Boney James' ""Body Language"". It does not disappoint - from his version of Janet Jackson's ""I Get So Lonely"" to his ""Boneyizm"", you will play this CD over and over again. Also a must listen: ""I'll Always Love"" with lead vocals from Shai. This CD a regular play in my 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier's CD player - in stressful, hardworking Washington, DC, this CD is greatly recommended; especially if you are commuting here to the Capitol on the Beltway, I-395, or on I-295. This CD will pump you up, but soothes you at the same time :)"
5,So smooth and so sexy!,I have all of Boney's CD's now even his Christmas one. I don't know how but each one is so sensual and sexy. I can hear Sweet Thing on the radio while going down the road and I'am back at South Beach at his concert. This new CD is just as good with my favorite being I'll Always Love you. Once you buy a CD by Boney you'll want them all.
3,Pretty Good,though when it comes to Jazz I prefer Older Jazz Artists I did check out this disc.and it was Pretty Good.I really dug his version of Janet Jackson's I Get Lonely.Lovefest&Are you ready are cool.but this ALbum does suffer from too much Appeal.he does at times sound Like Kenny G.but I can Listen to Him overall.
4,Super smooth sax,"Boney James consistently creates a smooth sultry melodic sound whether he plays soprano, alto or tenor sax. Body Language is an easy listening CD that illustrates the versatility and soulful backround of Boney James. He represents a far less commercial and more enjoyable version of Kenny G. His passion for his music comes through on this CD."
5,The Greatest CD. ever.A good cross over,BodyLangue is so hot this is one of the best CDs Boney'has done with at least two R.B cross over tunes All Nioht Long'for sure Great CD.
3,Just Another Video Showing Naked Women,"The girls are pretty, and look better naked. It's manufactured nudity directed to make us guys (or girls) get aroused, or at least excited. It's another video of a contest to determine which good-looking and sexy girl can arouse the most men (and women) by slowly removing their wardrobe and dance in their birthday suit. All the girls are good-looking and sexy, but a couple of them will make you rewind the video and watch them do it all over again. If you're a fan of non-hardcore pornographic videos that only show nude, sexy, and bodacious young women, then add this video to your collection."
5,It's A Keeper,This peels garlic with no mess or fuss. No ordor on your hands. Great for making garlic chicken where about 40 or more whole cloves are used.
1,to small not for trucks,this thing will not fit a 2005 f-150 i got it on and i had to use a pry bar and then it ripped. this steering wheel cover is crap.
4,Great gift Idea for Longhorn lover!,"My husband has everything longhorn, so it is really hard to find him unusual gifts. This was great because his steering wheel was starting to get worn. My only complaint was as a weak woman, it was really hard to get on, but I finally managed and he loves it."
1,Music without the video...,"..kind of sucks. Let me explain. I was watching a music video online and found the song Break Stuff sounded great. So I went and bought this disc. And to my horror I found Break Stuff and the other songs were so bland. Not bad, no, much worse than that. Boring.I realized, that most songs today were created and written to go along with video images. The lyrics, music and video all hold each other up. Without one of the legs modern music, made for muisc videos, just does not hold up off the screen. It is flat and tasteless."
4,Good book for beginner photographer,"This book starts out by explaining some of the basics of general photography, and then uses that knowledge to explain all of the features of the Canon Digital Elph S100. I, being a beginner photographer, found that with the S100 as my first camera ever I had a lot to learn about the camera before I could take good pictures. This book explains everything about photography and then applies it specifically to the S100 with detailed instructions on how to use the manual features of the camera to get better quality photographs. It has definitely helped me in my approach to taking pictures and told me tricks to use in order to get the best picture possible out of the camera. If you're going to buy the S100 you should know a little about photography and this book explains all the connections between the two."
2,"Informative, but disappointing","In spite of the low rating, I'd still suggest it to an inexperienced photographer who got an s100 or s110 as a first camera. It covers the details of good shooting (framing, exposure, composition) with very concrete examples, and will certainly help someone find reasons to try all of the nifty features of the camera.However, the S200 is the ""current"" camera in that line, and the book needs an update, though the general features are still applicable.The *real* disappointment is that this is a black-and-white printing, with velobind-style binding -- nice in that it lays flat, but I can do as well or better in any copy shop off of a web page. The example pictures do lose a lot (the captions indicate that the authors are aware of this, and explain in words, but really, I want a book, not excuses.)I can't fault the writing - I just wish it had been produced with more quality; magazine style, perhaps..."
2,In Goodwill Pile,"I couldn't find much about this video that I liked. I know exercise routines are subjective, but I was disappointed after reading the high reviews(who is paying these people)! Here's what I didnt like: Instructor started off jumping rope, she talked unnecessarily throughout, and the music was awful, and... the yoga had same music as aerobic part..huh?!! I have bought many, many exercise videos over the years and admit I like fun or somewhat interesting ones. My favorites are Richard Simmons party off pounds, any leslie sansome, and tantric yoga. This one just didn't make the cut."
5,Good morning wakeup,"Holly does some nice morning wakeup type workouts. I have some little hip, back issues and her workouts don't aggravate them...Unfortunately, don't have a dvd player in the house any more...gotta find a streaming version."
2,Boring,"I did this once and was so bored, went back to Denise Austin in a flash! Having said that, I'm sure it would be a good workout but it's just every boring."
1,It doesn't work in my computer OR my DVD player!,"I wish I could return the dvd. I loved the workout. I rented it first, then purchased it. It worked once on my MacBook. After that I got a message saying that there was a problem with the dvd player in the computer. Used it with a dvd player and it worked for a week or so and then just didn't play."
1,Disappointing,"In every story, I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, and it never did. The description on the DVD sounded like they should be scary, or at least a little twisted, but nothing ever really happened. As the other reviews say, the actors talent is wasted."
1,Not so good,"With all of the talent in this production I thought I couldn't lose. I was wrong. The actors (particularly Gandolfini and Knightley) did their part. It was the plots that were lacking. Too choppy, not enough time to care about the characters. Too bad, waste of great talent."
3,"Great cast, Bad Movie","This movie lacks so many things. Each story in it is very mediocre and i disliked most of them even though i love Keira Knightley, Hugh Jackman, and James Gandolfini. The best two scenes i thought were Jackmans and Gandolfinis but other than that this movie is rather bad and a waste of money if you are a fan of anyone in it."
1,Don't spend your money!,"I bought this DVD because it had several fine actors in it, Cate Blanchett, Hugh Jackman, Paul Bettany. I have only watched 3 of the 6 short stories which were so poorly made, poorly photographed & directed that I wonder why such good actors participated in them. Awkward, look like home movies."
3,Another Perspective,"What you have on this CD is a talented guy, hip enough to recruit Ornette Coleman to play sax for him; clever songwriting; highly mannered singing; one enervated, downbeat song after another; occasional energy in the arrangements, and especially in the instrumental track ""Nico""; a hidden sax solo that begins at minute 7 of the closing track, after a couple minutes of silence. All in all, worth a listen, but you may find yourself going back to single tracks rather than the whole CD. Pax to the reviewers who think this is jazz--it's not, it just has some jazz musicians on it. I understand Joe Henry fans giving it four and five stars; I'm offering this alternate view for those who are not already his fans, who looked this CD up because of the current good publicity for it."
4,Late Night Music,"He is Madonna's brother-in-law, but he sounds more like Tom Waits' baby brother. This is late night lounge music for those who like it dark, moody and Ornette Coleman dissonant. Coleman, in fact, plays on the album which, in itself, puts a million miles between this and what is played on your radio these days. Henry's earlier album Trampoline is still an enduring favorite. But, like Waits, his degree of difficulty increases with each record. As a result, he doesn't stick every landing. But it is always a delightful and, frequently, gratifying treat to listen to him try."
2,"Lighten Up, Joe","Joe Henry has been quietly releasing CDs for more than 15 years now with lots of critical acclaim and little public recognition. With each release however, Joe sounds a little more detached from the proceedings. This CD ""sounds"" great, the musicianship is top notch, and Joe remains a good vocalist. The overall mood is dour, not that any of his albums are big on humor. Missing is the sense of fun that marked Trampoline, which remains his best CD to date. Missing is the sense of wonder that marked Kindness of the World. There are some good songs, especially the epic Edger Bergen. Two stars--I have higher expectations for an artist of such obvious talent."
1,A Big Disappointment,"What am I missing here? I had not heard of Joe Henry before and purchased the CD on the basis of the great reviews it had received. I was expecting a diamond in the rough. After several listenings, this CD has none of the spirit of jazz, rock, or dare I say pop that many seem to think this CD posesses. The melodies and lyrics are tedious and rarely stray from stream-of-consciousness ruminations. A big disappointment!!"
5,Enjoyable game for kids!,"My three younger children really enjoyed this game-it was easy to understand and fun to play...there are several ways to play the game so it adds variety also. Great for homeschooling, and also for educational game playing."
2,Game's instructions are confusing. Pieces are too big to fit the squares.,"We played this game for the first time with two adults, a 13 year-old, and a 10-year old. The instructions are poorly written; and even worse, the pieces are too big to fit the spots where they are supposed to fit. It's as if the game designer had the idea that they could use metal pieces like in Monopoly, but they were too expensive. So you never know where your piece fits, and since the instructions are unclear, it's never clear what you can or should do. Buy Blockus instead!"
1,Returned Game as Duplicate,I had to return this game and contacted the company to get accurate return information.Game was delivered to them on 1/8/08 and as of 1/17/08 there has been no refund issued. Had to contact them for status.Fair warning.
5,Better than tinker toys!,I thought I was ordering Tinker Toys but these are larger pieces and more durable. My grandsons are 3 1/2 and 5 1/2 years old. They are trying to use the diagrams to build their favorite constructions so this is also educational.
2,"Delightful. colorful pictures, but with some problems","This is obviously supposed to be sung to the tune of ""Over in the Meadow"" (It is a not-so-original take-off of that old song.) Unfortunately, the beginning phrase ""Over in the grasslands"" has the right number of sylables, but causes the tongue to stumble over the next line when singing aloud. Worse, the clever premise of setting the story in Africa, is not very well executed. The toads appear to be frogs on lily pads, the monkeys look like chimps to me, and the eagle looks suspiciously like an American bald eagle. Do warthogs go ""Oink""? Just in case you think I am being picky, the above possible errors were pointed out by my 2 and a half year old grandson whose mom just happens to be a biology teacher. While I didn't expect a science book, I do wish a little more care had been given to choosing animals that were exclusively African and protraying them a little more thoughtfully."
2,Not the best,"Bought this for price. Hard to get accurate readings. Would not recommend this to anyone, spend more money and get a up to date system"
3,The Country Teasers,"I know them and they are, on the whole, horrendous human beings, but their music can be ok if you are someone with too much free time, I am guessing."
1,Do not buy,From the moment I tried to use them they do not work. They won't cut anything no matter how thin.
1,same as others,Only really works easily for branches under 1/2-3/4 inches. Hardware constantly loosens (I put on my own locking nuts). Pins break - and try to find replacements! DO NOT BUY THIS!
1,Poor design and quality,"A pin broke after about 5 uses, the nuts and bolts are constently needing tighting, and if you are trying to cut something bigger at 1/2 inch there is a good chance the handels will cometogether smashing your fingers. Do not buy these."
5,GREAT,I don't understand why there is only one other review for this. This album is absolutely brilliant and fantastic.
4,great entertainment,"My 16 month old lab/mix destroys everything. So far this is still standing. He dumps all the toys out & plays with the bin, trying to get the logo off!! Keeps him entertained for awhile."
3,Cute Storage,Review from Girlfriend:I've wanted this storage unit for over a year now but never could justify spending $30. I finally sucked it up and purchased it. I love the look and it is pretty large and holds all my dog's items. I normally would have returned this item as its not very durable since the plastic seems pretty thin... but I cant seem to find another storage unit that is as good looking.
4,very happy,"initially i dint love it because it didnt really look like the pic, but i am very happy with the purchase. Its a storage bone and it fits al my lil girls hygiene products, toys, and outfits."
3,afraid,I used to use a wicker basket for toys an then switched to this. I am having to work with the dogs to get their toys from it. I don't know if they smell it or what; but on the good side the house says cleaner and I don't trip over toys as much.
1,Don't bother with this piece of junk!,I looked forward to receiving this as away to clean up the clutter of my puppy's growing toy collection. I was very disappointed when I received it. The first thing I noticed was that it was dirty and had a line of pen ink across part of the top. Then I went to take it out of the box and I was shocked by how flimsy the plastic is. This is really a piece of junk. I'm returning it and for what I paid I can get a sturdy Rubbermaid container. It won't look like a cute dog bone but it won't be a cheap piece a plastic either. Consider yourself warned.
5,Doggie toy box,This is to cute!! The price was so cheap on Amazon! We put his name on it with stick on letters! He loves to dig in it to get his toys out!! We get a kick out of him digging around to find what he's looking for!! Thanks!
4,Puppy Toy Box,Purchased this to keep puppy's toys organized when he's not playing with them. I like the look of the toy box and the size is good (ordered the Large). The plastic is a little thin but it is not flimsy. My only complaint was that the lid was a little warped or something because it was hard to fit completely into the base. For that reason I deducted 1 star but it really isn't that big of a deal.
2,Not that Great. Cheap material,"I was excited to receive this item and replace my wicker basket which my dog had been chewing up and leaving all over the house. I was disappointed when I received it though. First off, the material was cheap and flimsy. I felt like the bottom and top didn't join together perfectly as they should. The way it's designed also makes it hard for my bichon poodle to get to his toys. If it were a little cheaper, maybe I wouldn't mind as much, but I felt like I was paying too much for such a cheap, poorly made product."
5,We love this Toy Box!!!,"This is a great toy box!! Looks great, super light and easy to clean! Great color too! I highly recommend!!!"
3,Got what I expected except it's missing parts.,"Bin looks basically as shown. The lid fit well for me, and you can actually pick up the whole bin by the handle when the lid is placed properly. However, the house shaped Pet Zone decal shown on the front was missing from my order. Instead there's just a big indented gap with ugly holes and nobs in it."
3,"Good size, but the top doesn't close well","Good size, but the top doesn't close well. The material and termination is not the same that the seems from the picture"
4,My Long Time Favorite,"I've been using these 2.0s as my primary pick for years now and I love them. The way the material surrounds your finger tips is unique and not found in a flat pick. They're very easy to keep a grip on and allow you to go after the strings confidently.You will however find that there is a sweet spot in the life of the pick's tip. When you first use them the business end is extremely pointy, sharp almost. After playing a bit, the tip begins to round off and is perfect for a long time. Eventually, it really rounds out and you'll want a fresh one. I typically lose them before they wear out and they are so nice, you won't care."
5,Great picks!,"I came from the school of thought where little emphasis was placed on subtle devices such as picks etc.However, having used these picks I am completely swayed.On electric guitar the attack is so much more pronounced and clear, the difference immediately stands out.On acoustic as well, the notes are extremely defined.I'm glad I ordered the 'two dozen' pack.Will order a next pack just to make sure I've got more on hand."
3,Desert Moon DVD,"I've had the CD for quiet some time & always loved the music. However I've always loved the videos but seeing them for the first time in quite a long time, they seem dated. Still fun to watch."
2,"Compatible, not Canon Brand","The description on Amazon says Canon imageCLASS X25 Black Toner Cartridge, however, the actual item was a compatible toner cartridge. Although the item worked, I think that the description is misleading because a similar compatible toner could be purchased at lower cost. Amazon should tighten up the item description requirements so that customers will not be mislead."
5,Canon X25 Cartridge,"Cartridge arrived lickity split! Easy to use and I really appreciate Canon's efforts in recycling by providing a box and shipping label to return the used cartridge. Fast, easy and free shipping makes this choice a winner! Oh, and the price was better then local or online 'box' stores."
5,Excellent buy,Item is exact replacement for this printer and the price is unbeatable. Item received in a timely manner and was everything advertised at the best price I could find.
4,Canon Compatible x25 Printer Cartridge,"Product works well, notwithstanding that I ordered a Refurbished toner cartridge, but received a Compatible one instead. Also, the Shipping offer is strange. If I had ordered by 12:30pm, product would have shipped that same day. But because I ordered at 12:35pm, it didn't ship until two days later. So if someone else had ordered the product one day later than I did, but before 12:30pm, it would have shipped before mine did."
3,Geography?,"Received as a requested gift this 20 piece set and while it's pleasant enough, it is not what was advertised. The description clearly states that the dinnerware is ""Made in England."" Now I realize it's been a long time since I've been in school but I'm somehow sure that Colombia hasn't become part of the United Kingdom (England) and all of these dishes say ""Made in Colombia"" on the bottom. I am disappointed."
3,"Yep, I got Columbian ""Made in England"" china also","It is disappointing to be lied to so blatently. The pieces are nice for the price though. When they say ""a lighter, more contemporary feel"" they mean a thinner, less substantial feel. The bowls are on the small side and it is a small bread and butter plate, not a salad plate. Oh well."
3,"Where is Columbia, England?","I wish I would have read the subject about geography in product reviews, as I was so disappointed in the finish and to see ""Made in Columbia"" stamped on the bottom of my Made in England china. What's your exchange policy for a quality product that is as it is described?"
1,Made in Malaysia - not England,"I purchased this set last year, not realizing that the dishes were a product of Malaysia. They did not match the pieces that I currently had - from England - that I was trying to match. I ended up sending them back, very disappointed."
1,NOT MADE IN ENGLAND!!! BEWARE,"Certainly not made in England, its made in Columbia and in certain pieces the colors and design are so blurry that you cannot even clearly read the Made in Columbia text on the back of the plates, its all smudged. I guess the earlier reviewers must have got the made in england stuff which has much better quality images on the plates....I saw one at a friend's place(they were the Made in England ones) and bought these for my girlfriend who loved them when she saw them at my friend's party....but we were thoroughly disappointed with the quality of the product, the edges were uneven, all pieces were different in the quality of the the colors and printing.The only good thing was the exceptional free and fast delivery and great return policy from amazon.So our advice - DONT BUY unless you want a really cheap, throwaway price product for your kids who frequently break dishes and stuff..."
4,Not made in ENGLAND,"I expected they were not made in England for the price and I really do not care BUT would prefer it, AMAZON needs to take that off the page. I have a lot of Churchill thats made in England including completer pieces from this set.Ok....the transfer on all the dishes was fine except the side plates, they were all blurred (I got 2 sets of 20). I find this on many antique or vintage pieces as well. NO chips or cracks in shipping.I collect Blue Willow antique china and have over 200 pieces from different makers, I always wanted some just to use.Nice weight to the pieces, great for everyday use which is why I got them."
1,Not pleased with anything.,"This Churchill China looks as shown but the Country of origin is NOT England but Colombia. Also, there are firing imperfections on the backs of all pieces. I'm unhappy with the fact that AMAZON shipped me the 4 piece set with a hole in the top of the factory carton; which they absolutely had to see; and put the box inside a shipping box which showed no sign of damage so no claim with the shipping company. This being said, one of the bowls was broken, and to replace it you have to pay to ship the whole thing back not just the 1 bowl and then wait to receive the new set. It bugs me that they new what they sent was damaged and sent it anyway!!!!!!!!!!!! I could complain this one into the ground but I'll just stop."
2,"Boring, disjointed","I attempted to watch this film with my sister a few weeks ago and we couldnt get past the first 20 minutes. It starts out very dull and disjointed, hard to follow, and rather than waste another night on another poor movie, we put in something else. I'll give it another go later but I don't expect much better."
3,A film noir look at history,"The Gleiwitz Case will appeal to those people who are hard core ww2 history buffs and outside that niche, I doubt it has any appeal at all. This is a short film and at moments it seems to go off track, but the unvoiced metaphors in the circus like music and the senseless montages tell you the Reich is careening towards insanity and the attack on Gleiwitz is the match that will light the fuse. Don't expect any answers or any manner of emotional wrap up to the tale; this is about the start of war, not its ending or happy ever afters.Is it good? In a sense I thought so, but it really is up to each viewer to make out of it what he can. The ultimate irony is that; these events are truly how ww2 started and after you've seen them, you can only shake your head in bewilderment."
5,The Truth is stranger than fiction,"I needed a book for one of my classes and I happened to pick this one up. I thought it looked interesting and so I began to read it. I was astonished as the author, Charles Berlitz, made convincing arguments that Atlantis was real and not legend. I have had mythology and classical classes that made the same statements but it was left up to us to believe whether it was true or not. Berlitz demands that you look at his information and draw the same conclusion as he; that Atlantis truly existed. While I can't say that I totally believe I have a clearer picture and will definitely research it more. Maybe someday I will be writing a book that does prove that Atlantis existed."
1,Same old nonsense,"Like all books about Atlantis (and, for that matter, other silly pseduoscience and pseudohistory), this book provides no evidence except that which the author makes up. The fact of the matter is, the science of plate tectonics and continental drift shows, conclusively, that no continent could ever have existed in the Mid-Atlantic. The source of the Atlantis legend, as anyone who objectively examines the evidence will find, is the Minonian civilization of the ancient Aegean, which was destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 1629 BC. While this may not be as fanciful as the Atlantis story, at least it's true. Put your thinking caps on, folks! The truth is what is supported best by the evidence, not what excites us most!"
5,good price for beautiful memories from my childhood,"I love this collection..well my kids too, has so many cartoon that may kids ask me everyday for watch it. good price for good memories"
4,WOW DO YOU LIKE INCREDIBLE DEALS?? OK WELL THEN BUY THIS,"EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THESE CARTOONS ARE NOT THE EXACT SAME ORIGINALS FROM THE 70S, WHATEVER. THIS COLLECTION COST LIKE 50 BUCKS OR SOMETHING AND YOU GET LIKE 100 PLUS CARTOONS. MOST ARE GREAT. BUY IT AND BE HAPPY."
4,Marketing Manipulation,"This is another case where they try to squeeze more profits from the most committed fans. If you've bought the PP cartoon DVDs in any or all of the previous packages, you'd still miss two DVDs that are contained ONLY in this bundle: The Inspector Part Deux, and Roland & Ratfink. So if you're a PP fan who hasn't bought any of the previous cartoon DVDs, this is the most complete set. If you're tired of manipulation, forget it. They did the same thing with the PP movie collection where they left one movie out of the collection bundle, until later."
5,Pink Panther rules!!,Been a Pink Panther fan all my life. Was glad to be able to get the entire DVD collection.
5,"A powerful blend of love, hope, and reminiscence","Dreamtown could not be more aptly named. Los Angeles is the stuff of dreams, both good and bad. Jango captures the true spirit of the region -- boundless optimism tempered with soft sorrow -- in its masterfully soulful melodies. No one has, or ever will, conveyed the Angeleno experience more accurately. Listen and you will understand."
5,Lovingkindness Meditation,The Inspirational Sharon Salzberg does a beautiful gentle talk and meditation all about love and living. I noticed a difference in the way I felt about life after listening to it only one time. It is an important tool for meditation and an awakened happy life. You won't be sorry to own this one.
5,Terrific audiobook,"This is an excellent audiobook that provides a comprehensive overview of metta (lovingkindness) practice. I actually bought it thinking it was a companion audiobook of guided meditations to her book Lovingkindness: The Revolutionary Art of Happiness, but it turns out that this is essentially an audiobook version of that book!She has a very pleasant, calming voice, and is easy to listen to. However, it's not so soothing that she makes me fall asleep - I've listened to it in my car. I will certainly be buying more of her books and audiobooks. Highly recommended!"
5,A joy to behold,"The samples dont do it justice... This is an excellent work of guitar blends, and the 2nd track ""the language instinct"" is a combination of haunting and heavenly.. This song alone is worth the price of admission!!! I will be tracking down every piece of vocals I can find from this brilliant obscure singer. As to the rest of the songs, well, they cant be beat for rich acoustical guitar blends.. This is an underappreciated work, which I only found out about through ""echoes"" radio program.... check out echoes.org , and if you can afford it, buy this cd. You wont regret it....and please Mr. Pritchard, have Teri de Sario sing on ALL your songs!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,zzz,"This no-namer got a name by touring with GNR for a year or two and playing on a covers album. Nothing else there. That supernova thing is a complete joke even without that deadbeat singer. Somehow I felt compelled to write a review here, I don't even know why."
4,"Very tasty, but requires some knowledge of beer","All of the recipes I've tried are very good and seem to adjust well to substitions and experimentation. The only criticism I have is that the book does not adequately explain what the difference is between an amber and a pale or a bock and a stout. Some of them are fairly straight-forward (and my preceding examples probably aren't the best), but when the book calls for an unusual type of beer, I'm left scratching my head. It would have been helpful to state what quality of the beer each recipe benefitted from (thickness, head, hoppy flavor, heavy flavor, etc) so that substitutions of a similar beer could be made."
1,This book is a joke!,"The author has never read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. But, she felt compelled to write a sequel. The book starts by reviewing past events that are in Austen's original novel. The problem is the author has no idea really what happens in Pride and Prejudice. It was like she heard the book through a friend who had quickly scanned through it. I admit that this book was good for a laugh at how stupid this woman is but other than that it's worthless! Any of the other sequels are better than this trash!"
1,Terrible,I'm not picky about Jane Austen sequels and I like most of them but I could not even finish this one. The writing style is that of a 10 year old and I really could not make it past the fact that the Darcy's saw the Eiffel tower on their honeymoon some 80 years before it was built. Don't bother.
1,Trust & Triumph,"This is the weakest sequel I have read. The story is weak, and she slips farther and farther out of Regency speak as the book goes on. My main problem is that she has no knowledge of punctuation in publishing so the sentences are very hard follow. SAVE YOUR MONEY -- DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.CELESTE, FOSTER CITY, CA"
1,Very Poor Indeed,I am only half way through this book and am already very disappointed in it. I should have read the reviews prior to ordering it.It has many typos as well as disjointed sentences. I am so unhappy with it that a further review would be pointless.
2,sad to say but true,"Sad to say but true, after being an actor in a movie which started out with some potential alas finds itself a less than B movie. The director or editor or whoever decided to throw in unneeded bad language as well as some bad cuts. Most of the actors, well known, faired well through the cuts...but one obviously did not. Over-acting or bad-acting in this movie dropped it's potential to a less than acceptable flick. Pity...it was fun to work with most of the actors and crew."
