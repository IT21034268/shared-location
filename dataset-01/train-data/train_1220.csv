4,Fun Game,I've played this game at my friends house a lot because I love star wars and RTS games. THis is one of the best I've played. I think that a lot of that has to do with the space battles because they're awesome. If they weren't there the game would just be like another Command and Conquer game. I was really good at the economy and maneging planets because I also own Rome TotalWar and I knew how to do it. This game Rocks
2,quickly gets old...,"it's really a superficial game lacking any real depth. like many rts's, once you figure out how to win the game its basically over for you. you will stick around to launch a few star destroyers and play with the heroes, but this game doesn't have more than a week's (or less) worth of play to it really."
2,"Not Rebellion, but I wish it was","Man, I was really hoping for an updated version of Rebellion, with actual strategy and not just RTS elements. This isn't it. The strategic portion of the game is only a thin veneer built on top of the combat engine, which is a pretty good RTS. But this isn't really a strategy game. It's Starcraft with multiple battlefields. If that's what you're looking for, then this is a good game for you. I should have held out for Rebellion 2."
4,Empire at War- love it now wheres the expansion,"The game is a blast to play-it is a lot more fun than Rebellion and damned entertaining to play. I just love running around with Vader and the Emporer kicking the crap out of everything. And look at those AT-AT-the game rocks pure and simple.The comments about the AI might be accurate on galactic conquest but the AI seems better on the Campaign screens that sort of follow the movies.I hope that in the future a patch or expansion will become available that allows the building of Super Star Destroyers, the naming of your minor heros, the addition of more heros from the original trilogy and some of the books (the prequals stink like a dairy farm).A rebellion element that is missing is the diplomacy of some of the characters- maybe not need in this game but liking rebellion I expected to see that in the game.Overall- game rocks but theres lots that could be added. I love the cinimatic views."
3,"Good game, but could have be better","If your a big Star Wars fan such as I am, you're probably going to get this game anyway. I'll let you know though that it was over hyped and I'll tell you real quick why I think that. The ground (or planetary battles) are rather weak and they don't have that epic feel that the movies do. I think that part was neglected when they made the game. Like it was rushed or something. On a good note, the space battles are visually stunning and offer a good strategy challenge for you RTS fans. I esspecially love how pieces of large ships are still floating around for a while after being destroyed. Plus, the music score is derived from all six movies and is used very well in this game. Overall, it's not a bad game but it could have been better."
1,Was not Compatible! Deceptive lableing!,"This is a PC DVD Rom. Not a CD Rom, as it is marked in the picture. This was deceptive and we could not get it to interface with our pc."
5,Empire at War a Great Game,"So far I only play the tutorials and one mission but the game is amassing, the graphics the control. You are in the world of Star Wars is very addicting and very fun I really recommend this job, buy it."
2,Boring....................................................,when i first purchased this game I thought it would have action not strategy. all you do is command not live the battles. When I first played it i nearly fell asleep. Dont buy this crappy game.
2,Not terrible,"I had high expectations for this game... but I think it falls short. The campaigns are a bit rigid and don't leave much room for player improvisation. For actual battles, an organized way of using units tactically is very difficult to come by.Most unfortunately the opponent's position, strength, movement, etc. is almost always completely shrouded! Droids, smugglers, and bounty hunters do little to remedy this fact... Consequently there is not much strategy going on here; just build up as big a force, as quickly as possible and be ready for an attack at any time. Even after an attack has begun, there is so little info. regarding the other side you can't do much in the way of tactics.On the plus side, the cinimatic views are very cool, and the grafics are good, and Star Wars characters add a mystique to the whole thing... If you like being the brains of your game I wouldn't pick this one up."
2,Don't believe the hype.,"While many reviewers are insinuating that finally a decent Star Wars game has surfaced, beware! I decided to purchase this game solely on reviews I had read here and elsewhere. I was extremely disappointed when after only a few hours of playing I had mastered it completely and was left with nowhere else to go. I can now finish the game on the hardest setting in under 20 minutes.There is no challenge, no replayability factor, and certainly nothing in-game worth experiencing again. What I'm stuck with now is a $50 piece of software that I will never use again."
4,fun fun,C & C but with star wars... fun and exciting with 2 moeds of play. though doesnt always install correctly
5,StarWars Empire at War is awsome!,(This review is by my 12-year old son)I Think this is one of the best games ever made.Any one who is looking for a good game that has no....1. Blood2. Bad wordsIs a good game that test thie mind.
4,"Fun moments, but tires quickly","This is a fun game and allows you to command both land and space forces. It's more of a strategy game where you direct units. I enjoyed the ability to play battles at the head of Star Wars fleets. The game includes most of the main ships from the movies (although the TIE Interceptor and B-Wing are conspicuous absences), as well as new vehicles. As fun as it is though, the concept gets old pretty quickly. There are only a limited number of combat spaces, and aside from the background scenery there are few differences between them. Moreover, the game limits the number of forces you can build, so at most you can only fight with 2-3 large capital ships at a time. Perhaps the biggest problem is that it's fairly easy to build a huge fleet and conquer at will. Despite that, it's a great opportunity to command Star Wars fleets. I got mine as part of a pack of games, and I don't know if I'd buy it alone, but I'm glad I did eventually get it."
2,Average psych rock,"To put a little reality check on the gushing: The riffs, songwriting, and overall sound of T.I.M.E. is banal and characterless, sort of like Steppenwolf if they had no songs. If you're looking for obscure hard rock from this era, there are plenty of things to choose from before bothering with this: Sir Lord Baltimore, Three Man Army, Gun, Nitzinger, Kingdom, Frijid Pink, Demian, Bubble Puppy, Bang, Cain, the Litter, Twentieth Century Zoo, Geordie, and so on. I'm sure demand now warrants the collectors' price that appears for a used copy as I write this; however, if you pay that, you'll be one sorry consumer. This is a classic? Come on ..."
1,too small for CD's,Will not accommodate a CD in a slim jewel box. Not a useful size. For mailing CD's find the next size up. Very thin.
3,looks better than pictured,"Looks great in my 19th century renovated kitchen! Only problem is the hose leaks and the finish is chipping where hose sits. Not the quality I expected for the money I payed. Also the aerator doesn't produce the best water flow. But, it's a great conversation piece and adds charm to the room."
1,POOR QUALITY,"The Faucet looks good if you are going for LOOKS not function. I had it installed by my contractor. The first day, i noticed that the water pressure was low, well i had my contractor removed it, cleaned it and reinstalled it. By the 3rd day the water was trickling down to barely nothing. I would not recommend this product. Needless to say i am going to return it if they will take it back."
4,Cuddle up with the one you love tonight,"Not Harry's usual big band style, this album lets the crooner demonstrate why he is our modern day Frank Sinatra. His smooth voice is a powerful tool in communicating the lyrics in these timeless love songs. If you are looking for the perfect CD to add to your collection that will spend most of the time next to your bedstand or in the dining room for candle light dinners with someone special, this is your CD.This CD got a 4 rather then a 5 simply because I didn't like the rendition of ""I Only Have Eyes For You."" Fans of this song will not enjoy the intonation Harry delivers in the song, but the rest of the album is nothing short of perfect."
4,Back to the Basics,"I've always thought Harry had an amazing voice, but his atonal renditions have never set that well with me. These cuts are more in the style of the pure standard, which I enjoy so much better!"
5,Two Thumbs Up High,"From the moment I purchased this CD, I have not been able to stop listening to it. I am in awe by Harry's ablity to make classic songs more beautiful. Not only does he sing (his voice is absolutely breathtaking) and play the piano, he arranged, orchestrated and conducted this album himself. Now that's what I call talent! I highly recommend this CD and know many others who have purchased it after listening to my copy."
1,Disappointing,"Plodding and passionless. Will be relegated to background music for dinner parties, at best."
2,It could have been better !!!! Much better !!!,"I have other H C CD's and I really like him and believe he is very talented. I heard him perform this week on the Today Show and loved his performance of one of his songs from this CD but when I purchased the CD, the song sounded completely different on the CD . So, I am very disappointed. What happened??? He gave it a nice jazzy twist, great rhythm, wonderful sound on TV. I wondered if the producers toned him down to this very very mellow interpretation??? It's o k but not what I expected from him . I am from new orleans also , and remember listening to him when he was a child. He is capable of so much more than this."
1,This boy has got talent,"Harry Connock Jr. (not to be confused with Harry Connick Sr.) is a young man who wants to sing a song for you. I love his songs and I think you will too, Such are their greatness !!"
4,"Harry, Harry, Harry","Now I've been a Harry Connick, Jr. fan for well over a decade...and have just about all of his albums. This album was a nice surprise...especially since he rarely did renditions of songs from the 50's and 60's. I think the way the music was arranged made the songs uniquely his own...and not a cheap imitation of the original artist. ""I Only Have Eyes for You"" is given a jazzy update...and it sounds just lovely. ""My Prayer"" and ""My Blue Heaven"" are also given delightful updates...as are the rest of the songs on this album. 50's and 60's flare with a jazzy modern feel."
5,Close to Perfection,"My first time delving into Harry's music was with ""She"" and ""Star Turtle"". ""Only You"" is now in a close second to ""Star Turtle"" of my favorite Harry albums. Harry continues to grow and mature with each new album. ""Only You"" is oozing romance. The string arrangements are beautiful and really fill out each number. I was a little sad that it has been marketed as a big band/orchestra CD when only one song contains the full big band. However after listening to the songs and the arrangements Harry has done, I can't imagine it any other way."
2,Only Two,"Stars that is. I'm a big Harry Connick fan, but not of this offering. A lot on here sounds like second rate lounge music. And since Harry arranged and conducted these songs, I can only lay the blame on him. Where is the zip and swing of Come By Me? Or the brassiness of Songs I've Heard? Nothing wrong with the song choices here, its just the way they're presented. I didnt think a song like For Once In My Life could be sung badly, but here it comes close. Hopefully this is just a momentary misfire, and Harry will go on to better things."
3,too slow,The songs are too slow and it is boring. I am disappointed. Luckily I only paid $12 for this CD
3,Not your typical swingin' Harry...,"I've been a Harry Connick fan for about 15 years now, and although some of his past work has been somewhat ""different"" (think ""Star Turtle""), I think I'm most disappointed with his latest album.If you like Tony Bennett, you are likely to really like this album. If you like swing/big band music, you will find this album incredibly dull. Although Harry's voice and arrangements are great as always, the album put me to sleep. Its boring tempo (yes, some may argue that was the trend of the 50s-60s, where these songs have been taken from), is simply bland. It is neither romantic nor enchanting music. Also, it does nothing terribly new or interesting with the music of the era.I sincerely hope Harry somehow returns to his roots of ""We Are In Love"" and ""Blue Light, Red Light"" in the future."
3,"It's nice, but didn't move me.","Well Harry, it's 'only you' versus some serious competition.While waiting for you to put out another album I discovered Michael Bublé and Rod Stewart had really filled the void left in my favorite musical genre with awesome albums. And now after such a long wait I'm left a little disappointed. Your early albums where incredible, this one is 'nice', but it didn't move me. Next time??"
5,Go Harry!,"I love this CD. My daughter (8), son (2) and I know every word to every song. They love making up moves to My Blue Heaven, while I swirl around the kitchen cooking dinner. This song is great for mellowing out, or a classy evening of entertainment at home. Something about this CD just invites candlelight and a glass of wine. This is my first HCJ disc, and I was so excited to peruse his collection. Honestly I don't like anything else he's put out as much as I adore this album! And hey, I was born in the 70s too. I can dig it."
3,Not up to Harry's best standards,"I'm a bit disappointed as I really like Harry. He sounded untrained on this CD, perhaps a bit lazy. He's still candy for the eyes but on this one the ears are on Splenda."
2,"Thank you, Harry, ten bucks saved","After a very disappointing viewing of Harry's Only You Concert DVD, I got smart and borrowed Only You CD from the library. I'd hoped that concert was just one off. How sad, this CD is no better than that wretched concert. Slooooooooooooooow from the start to finish. And what happened to Harry's voice and phrasing? God, unbearable. When Harry Met Sally, Come by Me, what happened to you, Harry?"
3,Not cutting it,"Connick Jr. is definitively multitalented individual ; he can really swing like a first class jazz musician and he can smoothly fall into the line with the great American pop tradition...This is an album of the latter, neo-sinatrian group, but it's just not good enough..."
1,A Big Disappointment,"Harry Connick Jr. sounds bored and on valium on this CD. There is no zip and you feel like you're playing it on the wrong speed. The arrangements are such that you have to wait for the words to begin in order to figure out what song it is! These are classic songs and you don't fool around with the classics! There's a limit to ""making the song your own""."
4,Best Since When Harry Met Sally,"Loved WHMS, but have not liked the majority of HCjrs cds since that one. This one has the sinatra-like music that I have been missing!"
5,Classic,"This is one of those classic Christmas cd's. We had it several years ago and then it was lost or borrowed or something. We were very glad to find another copy.The best is Tony Bennet (is that one or 2 t's?) singing ""Christmas in Herald Square""Light the fire, pour the drinks, and relax!"
1,Weak energy and slow compilation of songs,I like big band music but this CD is slow and lacking any fun. It seems as though it was running out of steam and sounds like the same song after song.
2,pool cue case,If you need a cheap case for your pool cue ... this is it. To look any cheaper you would have to wrap your pool cue in old newspaper.
5,My favorite album of all time,"This album has inspired me beyond words. It is the first girl-band to write and perform songs that rock, fight and convey the complexity of being a lesbian/girl/woman/queer/person of resistance to the status quo, that I know of. Donna Dresch is an amazing guitarist, who has played in many punk bands before this. Jody is unbelieveable, and also of Hazel fame. Both Donna and Jody have their own record labels: CandyAss and Chainsaw. I know I'm digressing but this history is relevant to their invention of live women's musical revolution without compromise. Kaia is also amazing and has her own albums. Everyone, including my father, should listen to this album. It's difficult at first to hear all the words, but it grows on you and takes you over. Highly reccommend to teenagers and adults alike for educational and free-ing purposes. Musically inspiring too. Enough said."
4,Very nice!,"I pretty much bought this cd because it was a compilation that had ""Superstylin'"" on it which is my favourite Groove Armada song, so I figured it'd be nice to see what else falls under the category. The minute I pushed play I was sucked into this groovy sort of place that I don't hear from quite often enough. I'd say anyone who likes Derrick Carter or Moonshine label artists could appreciate this cd. Nice reggae/drum&bass/house/psychedelic sounds brewing with this one."
3,Not completely updated,"I'm disappointed that the authors did not update Appendix B, ""Suggested Reading Materials"", and I'm not sure what other areas are missing updates. The text is somewhat simplified, but this may be useful to most readers. Good points are that the text includes practical charts, illustrations, an index, a few recipes, and other resources."
1,Repetitious,"I have two other books that echo much of the information in this book, so I found the entire book rather repetitious, and the other books I have are much better, more organized and more entertaining."
4,Pretty Good,"A bunch of the lounge-cover acts (Mike Flowers, Richard Cheese, Prozak for Lovers) sometimes have hard time getting over the ""Hey, lookit me, I'm so ironic and funny!"" aspect of the genre. Jaymz Bee for the most part manages to get past that, making this a fun disc for listening as well as astounding your friends. (Try throwing it in a mix with some normal party background music...)Two things about this project. First, he recruits lounge singers from various projects around Canada. Second, all the bands he covers are Canadian (Loverboy, Rush, Crash Test Dummies, Alanis Morrissette, Guess Who, etc.), so it's kind of a Canadians doing Canadians thing."
4,Dio - 'Inferno: Last In Live' (Mayhem),"Nicely presented 2-CD live album from Dio's 1997 'Angry Machine' world tour. This eighteen track audio document is good, but personally I like 2002's live 'Evil Or Divine' better. Perhaps it's because 'Inferno: Last In Live' is simply too routine for me. Saw Dio on this very tour with Cradle Of Filth as support. Decent setlist, liked hearing once again the metal goods like ""Jesus, Mary & Holy Ghost"", ""Straight Through The Heart"", ""Holy Diver"", Rainbow's ""Mistreated"", the ten-minute blazing guitar solo, ""The Mob Rules"", ""Long Live Rock And Roll"" and their sort (?) of anthem - ""We Rock"". Personnel: Ronnie James Dio - vocals, Tracy G. - guitar, Larry Dennison - bass, Scott Warren - keyboardist and Vinnie Appice - drums. A definite should-have."
5,Classic Metal from the man Dio,"Dio of course is on par with anything he has done in the past, but Tracy G is a rather sloppy guitarist. After seeing him play live one realizes that all Tracy G can do is eat, not play guitar.....All I have to say is instaed of eating cheeseburgers Tracy, learn how to play lead guitar......or, Dio if you are listening, get Goldy back, but other than fat boy this cd rocks"
1,Dio is done!,"Let me preface this by saying that I am a long time Dio fan. Although the quality of his work has slipped in the 90's I had high hopes for this live CD. Was I ever disappointed!This has got to be one of the most emabarrasing releases by an ""major"" artist in some time. Not only has Dio lost alot of range on his voice and is apparently sleepwalking through his material, but the gentleman playing guitar is a rank amature! Avoid this CD at all costs!"
4,dio live,"after reviewing the cd, i have found the guitar playing could be better,but ronnie is in true form (contrary to the idiot who said ronnie is losing his voice,dio on his worst day is better than ozzy 20 years ago)larry dennison and vinnie appice are tight and yes this is a live album that at least captures the essense of a live show and has not been washed with remixes,a must for any dio fan WE ROCK!!!!"
1,Avoid this album at all costs,"I have listened to Dio for a long time and consider his vocals to be without peer in the heavy metal arena. His voice is incomparably thick and rings with power whether he is diving into the depths or soaring into the stratosphere. With this release, however, we see a man who has lost much of his vocal range and has become only a fraction of the singer he used to be. If you want to listen to ""classic"" Dio live, pick up a copy of ""Sacred Heart"" and play the first song. Not only is his voice exceptional, but the guitar is much better than the almost unbearable amount of sloppy playing so fervently displayed on this cd. Do yourself a favor - don't buy it."
2,disappointing,"Obviously, there are some great songs on this album, but it suffers from being played as a 90's heavy metal album ie senseless drumming, over the top bass and poor lead, rather than incorporating the class of 70's stadium rock from where much of the music came from."
4,Great album,"This is my favorite album out of all the albums Kiss members have released. It's a lot better than the second Union album, ""The Blue Room."" It's a great album from the 1990's."
4,Great debut album. If only there other debuts were alike.,"Bruce Kulick is a great guitarist, we all know that. But, I was sceptical how he'll do without KISS. As it turns out, he's doing very well! The albums rocks, with a few tracks sticking out particulary. My favorites are ""Robin's Song"", ""Love (I Don't Need It Anymore"" and ""October Morning Wind"". If you're into modern hard rock (not alternative crap), give UNION a chance, you won't regret it!"
5,Ska Vs Punk,"Though this is not a very good ska album, I believe it is the best punk album I own. The energy they put into their albums and live shows makes them one of the best bands to ever play."
3,good but not great,"first of aal i want to apoligise if my english isnt good nut i'm from belgium,europe and we speak dutch.okay now, as being a huge ltj fan , i own all the albums and this was a hard album to get in.this cd is totally different from albums like hello rockview anthem, or any other ltj album.like people who only like ltj since anthem or borders and boundries will msot likely hate this cd. this cd has a more rougher (?) sound. you wont find things like auto tuning on this album. and instead of anthem's pop punk with a little bit of horns, this album is alot more ska, you either hate it or love it. songs are also very short and im sure some have been written in an even shorter time, cause musically this album is a lot of the same. but nevertheless this is a good album if you like true ska-punk ( and thats no punk with horns you idiots!!).early ltj fans will love this album ( like i do) but new fans will be disappointed and thats why i give this album only3 stars."
5,Losers and Kings...Aren't we all,"This has always been a great album but, with the added bonus DVD...It really satiates your appetite for ""Less Than Jake"" !!...BUY IT !!!"
5,AWESOME,You can't go wrong with Less Than Jake. Their music is upbeat and consistently great! I definitely recommend you buy this cd!
2,disappointing,"ok, so i found this book disappointing. i found the writing style weak and some what lacking. the story didn't pull me in very much, and neither did the characters.i found both lucas overbearing and annoying, and i think i would have been annoyed by him if i had to deal with him. he doesn't seem to give tessa much credit, and i just didn't get attached to him the way i like to. i couldn't have cared less what happened to him, and i didn't get the impression that he and tessa would last much past the end of the book.to be honest, i just couldn't figure out what tessa and lucas had other than lust. and like i said earlier, nothing in the writing style makes up for the lack of characters. in addition, there weren't a lot of good secondary characters to help prop the story up. over all, i would skip this book. although i will point out that i am in the minority, i really would recommend skipping this book."
4,Dignified yet Moving,"""Mrs. Brown"" is a lovely score, but it is very somber and dignified, and can be very heavy. The most light-hearted track is 'The Swim.' The music makes Victoria very alive, for she was very somber in the film. It sounds much better in the film than on the soundtrack. See the movie before you buy the music."
3,Only one thing missing!,"The score to Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown is in it's own way incredible. Listening to it I can take my self back to the scenes in the movie. However there is one thing missing from this soundtrack. My favorite scene, the dance between the Her Majesty aand John Brown. It was an incredible happy moment int the movie yet they left it off the soundtrack. Otherwise I recommend this to anyone who loved the movie I much as I did."
1,"Not a home run, but a broken bat grounder to the mound","A history of the Louisville Slugger bat that omits any mention of Pete Browning, the original ""Louisville Slugger"" who comissioned Hillerich and Bradsby to manufacture his bats in the 1880's, has to be considered somewhat flawed right off the bat (ouch). A jarring leap from 1870 to 1915, just the period when bats were developing from wagon tongues to modern bats, is unforgiveable. The tales of idiosyncratic bat habits and preferences of major league stars is interesting, but the book utterly fails in its titular premise -- the history -- and is graded accordingly."
3,Sweet soap opera,"This somewhat engrossing danish offering shows that you don't need a big budget to make a decent movie, all you need is some interesting characters and a script. Apparently shot with cheap videotape, most of the shots consist of closeups of people as they talk and interact with each other. (Talk about low budget, the closing credits are even handwritten!) Be all this as it may, the actors do a good job and we get wrapped up in the realistic lives of a clumsy pastry store clerk, some waiters, a temporary fill-in priest, a hairdresser with a sick mother, and some other lonely misfits who all end up in a municipal italian language class. There they find romance and hope, though not without a few complications. Overall this is a sweet film, despite a bit of dark realism (cruel parents, drug addicts, funerals), and we go away with the happy sensation that we have seen a movie made more for love than for money."
1,Know what you are getting yourself into,"We had no idea what we were in for when we rented this movie. I enjoy foreign films, so I probably would still have rented it knowing it was a Danish movie and based on the description, but I was unaware that I would be a guinea pig for an experimental film style. The description makes it sound like your normal, everyday feel-good romantic comedy with a few quirks, twists, and turns that will amuse and entertain...instead this felt like a poorly done student filmshot on a home video camera, with uninteresting characters, no plotline, no humor, and generally no redeeming qualities whatsoever, except the one Grand Canal vista about 5 minutes before the movie ends. I wish I could have those 2 hours of my life back. My husband and I wholeheartedly regard this as the worst movie we have ever seen. Ever. Ever, ever..."
1,Does Not Look or Move Like Film Should,"Hubby and I did not make it all the way through this film. We just hated the way it looked and the pace it moved at from frame #1. We packed it in early on and were glad we only rented it. It looks as if it were shot by someone first using a home video camera the day after unpacking it from the underneath the Christmas tree. It looks nothing like its beautiful cover on the box. I am thus in shock that this film just scored slot #7 on ""Time"" Magazine's Top 10 Films of 2002. Amazon customer/reviewer Tom Reynolds made it all the way through, hating every frame, and likened it to watching paint dry. I urge you to read Tom's blow by blow review, especially if you are really thinking about buying it. I almost did buy it at Borders shortly before Christmas as a gift to myself but divine intervention must have stayed my hand."
3,Beware Misleading Trailer,"I saw the coming attractions for ""Italian for Beginners"" several times before I headed off to see it with my friend Sheryl at the Angelika here in NYC. I was led to believe from that trailer that this was a light-hearted comedy. NOT! It's really quite depressing in most spots, about how six fairly unhappy people eventually wind up in the same Italian class, and then finally jaunt over to Italy to put it all into practice. While the movie did have some comedic elements--the dictatorial Italian substitute teacher, for instance--I'm afraid I was a little too brought down by the parental deaths and such happening here. I guess Danish movies might be a bit off for a beginner like me."
1,90 minutes I can't get back,"This may very well be the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't even know where to begin. The film (or shall I say ""tape"") must have been shot by a 6-year-old.There is absolutely zero character development. There's no music. The acting is eighth-grade-drama-class quality. They can't even get one of the ""actors"" to cry real tears, opting instead for what was sure to be an eye-dropper. The subtitles look like they were done in the early 80s.I'm normally a huge fan of foreign films, figuring that if they make it to the shelves of our local video stores, they're high quality. This film shot thousands of holes in my theory. This is no ""Talk to her."" This is no ""Y Tu Mama."" This is no ""Open your eyes.""I give the ""fim"" an F-. But the experience of mocking it while watching it in disbelief, an A."
2,Never Bad But Always Mediocre,There are a thousand amateur writers who could come up with a better screenplay than this. Just make 80% of the characters experience a death and throw in a budding romance and a couple of waning and potential romances. Throw them all in one classroom and call it good. It's hard to root for any of these people when the perspective changes so often. No one character sits still long enough for you to get to know them.
4,Touching and funny,"It's initially somewhat disconcerting to watch this movie, shot as a video rather than in traditional film format. But the script and the performances are so affecting and so honest that it quickly becomes entirely engrossing. A motley-seeming collection of average people: a raging restaurant keeper with a hidden talent for language, an accommodating hairdresser with a nightmare of a mother who just happens to be terminally ill, a klutzy, good-natured young bakery worker with a horrible father, a disaffected management type and a charming Italian waitress. They all find themselves at an evening class in Italian and they manage to make connections--with themselves and with the others in the class--in humorous and bittersweet ways.This is a very worthwhile film. Don't be put off by the oddness of the video. You'll forget about it soon enough and become entirely caught up in this wonderfully well-acted, truly touching and amusing film.Highly recommended."
5,If you love romantic stories...,"then this movie is not to be missed. Real people, ordinary people, are much more interesting than the so-called beautiful people. And how they interact in the ordinary moments in life and how they fall in love can be wonderful to watch. Contrary to what I read from another review a moment ago, I think this movie is extraordinarily uplifting! If you're a sentimental old fool like I am, you'll probably get a tear as the movie ends with the song ""Don't you know?"" playing in the background, as did I. What a lovely movie!!!! I just rented the VHS version but the DVD edition is going on my Christmas list--I want to OWN this film!"
5,romantic escape of danish middle class people,"6 desperate people are taking an italian class in order to forget their past and to go on with their unhappy lives. the dogma style is adapted, but the frames are not as shaky as the idiots or celebration.some parts are funny, but also intend to make the viewer think about their own life.my favorite character is the sport fanatic who's language and role contribute a great part to the comedy. all 6 people develop a great character and have their individual charisma"
1,Terrible,"I often rent foreign films or purchase them on amazon. Thankfully I rented this one so as not to be stuck with it.The movie description on the back of the dvd seemed interesting so I chose to bring it home. After getting dizzy from the hand-held camera I maintained composure and tried watching. The acting was sub-par and I had no real interest in the characters. I made it a half hour into the movie before I went back and returned it to the video store and upon handing it back said, ""never recommend this movie to anyone. ever."""
1,How to trick someone into renting the worst movie on earth..,"When my wife and I rented this movie, we did so because it came highly recommended from movie critics and because the movie case had the look of a quirky romantic comedy, similar to say, ""Woman on Top"". Even the description on the back of the movie conveniently leaves out the fact that it is an experimental Danish movie. We, however, moved past our anger at the marketing ploy and watched the movie anyway. Long story short, the script was boring and somewhat nonsensical, the actors were completely unbelievable, and the characters were unlikeable. It's just another case of a bad art film getting a good review because nobody wants to admit they don't like it for fear of looking uncultured or dumb."
4,Good movie to see,"I enjoyed this movie -- after I got past the camera shots, as noted by other reviewers. Like another person, I almost quit the movie before 30 minutes were up. It seemed slow to start. But, I'm glad I stayed with it because it developed into a nice story. The characters were real and the plot (though slow to develop) was good. I would recommend this movie."
1,disappointing,"not a comedy...not a drama, not worth it at all, do not buy. get another movie if you want to enjoy. i wonder what was nice about this movie, i saw many good reviews before buying it :("
5,You gotta have it,If you like pretty crazy lyrics and cool songs it is a must. A very nice job from this excellent guitar player
2,Disappointed Racer X fan,"Really was looking forward to an awesome instrumental album, and did not get what I had anticipated. Co-produced by Bruce Boullet (also of Racer X fame). I have only listened to this CD once, and will try again, but it's painful to listen to what seems like a regression in talent from when paul was in the 18-23 year old days. Racer X lives on.........."
3,Not as good as before!,"I personally believe the old one, X-Racer, is better. I prefer the guitar solo album more than singing the song, sorry!"
1,bad,if you like guitar virtuoses and great solos don't buy this album I hate it. You must try beehive live its great and a lot of jams in it
2,Not the same,I was excited to be able to order this fragrance for I used to wear it years ago. This product was discontiued by Clarins. The bottle I received did not smell the same as the original. Very disappointed.
5,excellent,"this show was intelligent, thoughtful and enthralling. Tom Conte's acting is supurb. I wish there were more episodes to look forward to."
1,Big Disappointment,"Very disappointed. Title of ""Music for Native American Flute"" is very misleading. Of the 40 songs in the book, 2 are Ojibway. All the rest are Irish, Scottish, Welsp, Spanisc and South American. Sorry does not meet my definition of Native American. Also find the use of Carlos Nakai's name to be misleading. Somehow, the name lends creadence to the Native American title. Actually only his fingering techniques are being used, with non-native American music. I feel scammed.Music for Native American Flute, Vol. 1 (Book & Audio CD)ed."
2,Springsteen songs,"Actually, there were two Springsteen songs in this movie, both from the ""The River."" The first was ""Drive All Night"" ... Stallone (Freddy) plays his while he's sleeping on the couch. The second, when he's with the woman he saved from drowning, also from ""The River"" is called ""Stolen Car."" Major disappointment that these songs weren't included on the soundtrack, but go buy ""The River"" now and you'll get them plus more!"
2,I think I can help you,"I believe the song you are looking for, which I have been searching for as well is Brothers under the Bridge by Bruce Springsteen. I believe this is the song he puts on the record player when he lays down on the couch, if that's the one you were writing about. Go to circuitcity.com and check out his '18 Tracks' CD. You can listen to part of it. Then try your local napster type site. Good luck."
2,Thank YOU!,"I was looking for that very song, and I was like there's no way there's a soundtrack to this movie, other than the score. And low and behold I wasn't the only one looking for that Springsteen song. I happened to be listening to Beck's new album Sea Change and it reminds me so much of that song from the film. I had to know just how similar they are. Check it out, Beck - Guess I'm Doin' Fine. Later!"
5,Best Guide Ever!,"What a joy to have a book not designed for tourists, but just for we who live, work and play in New York. It has all the info we need to access those neighborhoods we don't know as well as our own. I have used it every day since receiving it and don't leave home without it. It will be an annual purchase like Zagats from here on."
4,WOW! This is definitely PROG worthy!,"In the past year or so I've gotten into a genre of music called Progressive Rock. I also introduced a friend of mine to this genre, and when he heard this CD he told me it was like Prog and ""Dream Theater"" (an AWESOME rock group). When he told me this, I was a little skeptical, but it certainly lived up to my friend's comment! It's a great CD and I LOVE it! I only found one downfall: sometimes the music covers the vocals, and a little distortion can be heard, but for the most part, the recording is great, and the music ROCKS! ""Livesay"" should definitely become known around the world, especially by Prog fans. Great CD!"
4,Good mix but with a caveat,"This is good music IF you are a fan of record labels like P&P; & West End. I would also recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Larry Levan. If you are fan of the r&b;/punk group ESG, you may also dig this.Some other CDs I would compare this to include:*Masters At Work presents West End Records: the 25th Anniversary Mastermix*New York Dance Classics (volume 1 & 2)I own a decent amount of Tenaglia CDs spanning his entire career and I can't say that this sounds like anything else he has put out. So, if you want something that sounds like a typical Danny T. mix, keep on looking. If you are into the roots of house music and you dig old school 80s/early 90s house, then you may definitely want to check this out."
4,A nice change,"I don't have any ""classics"" cds but I do enjoy this one. It's a nice change to hear some disco / soul influences and I can see how songs like these helped to influence D.T. in his modern sound. You can dance to this collection or chill out to it. I skip perhaps 20% of the songs but the other 80% are good, in my opinion. Some of the tunes sound almost ""kevin yost-ish"" with some jazzy loops tossed in. Although some songs make you want to jump up and dance, don't expect all of them get you up with such immediacy. But you'll start to sway and groove and then find yourself dancing- like a lot of D.T. beats, they grow on you. I like it."
3,"I must be getting old, I am buying a collection of classics","Ai, I actually remember when most of these tracks where first released and I sure as hell do not want to end up with a ""best of"" or ""remember the (insert year)"" collection.I am not going to write a long review about this CD. I think it probably will be a good buy if you want to travel back in time and recapture the spirit of the early 90's - late 80's house scene. This also might be fun to listen to if you are interested in house-music and want to learn a bit more about how it actually developed over the years. However, if you want to learn more about what influenced Tenaglia himself, your better bet is his back to mine compilation. In all other cases, I think you might be a bit disappointed with this purchase."
5,lifesaver,i highly recommend this toy it was a life saver as my baby started teething at 2 months. A big plus is that it is dishwasher safe:)
5,another great manual,"Every Haynes manual is great, this is no exception... it saves so much time and money for the home mechanic."
3,Buy the Video,"A while ago, I got rid of my VCR and put in a DVD player in my computer. I re-purchased almost all the films I had in DVD format.This movie is one of the great classics of world cinema and is a must view. Why am I rating it only 3 stars? The DVD transfer is AWFUL. I sorely regret having given away my VHS copy; it was much better.Buy the VHS."
1,bad dvd,"DVD does not work, typical of EROS dvd production--failed, or a remake of a film when you want the first version, etc. The Eros version of Mother India I bought does not play on computer or DVD player. A waste of money."
2,Mother India,Very dissapointing with the DVD. There was NO English subtitles on the movie. Could not understand a word of the dialogue.
3,Descent fights okay plot,"the plot is based on good concepts. A dark emporer trying to take over a futuristic world and the only one who can stop him his right hand man, convinced to turn by the princess who refuses to marry the dark lord.Really I think that seince the movie was made from pocket change, the fight scenes were great. Not fantasti-gorical wonderments to get twitterpated with but pretty good. I think Dolf is a great actor/performer who doesn't use stunt men and keeps combat looking good, even if he's paid just enough to take his buddies to the arcade."
1,DON'T,"My favorite part of that movie is hero deflecting bullets by wooden table about 10 mm thick.Effects are cheap, combat not realistic and not even hand-to-hand as you may imagine from the cover.Don't show this to anyone older than 10 years."
3,This is one of those movies that your sure it is based on a good book.,Based in a alternate realty DL is a hardend warrior and suddenly and with little provaction becomes a softy and turns againist his long time leader who provided for him. The ungrateful DL character leads a revolution againist his once good friend.
5,An uplifting and emotional book.,"I think it is amazing how Mandie's brother visits her as an angel in this book. I cried a lot throught different parts of the book. This was the first Mandie book I had gotten, and at the time was eight years old. I have thus far collected the whole series, and I am now 16. I love the Mandie books. They are a great source of inspiration for when you are having difficult times, they have wonderful christian values, they uplift your spirits, and they have a mystery attatched to them! Keep on writing!"
4,This is a great book!,I really liked this book. It really is amazing how an angel comes and gives her comfort.It is also interesting how Mrs. Leppard weaved a mystery into the story.I think she did a great job with this book!
2,Typically over-rated Drucker stuff,"Although this supposed masterpiece has much more life than most boring Druckerian narratives, it is still relatively slow and heavy reading. Drucker is fairly decent at analyzing minutia, otherwise not obvious to most of us, from seemingly mundane situations -- so, I will give hime the bystander monicker. But, to think that any of what he is describing even borders on adventures is preposterous. He is, most definitely, the Salman Rashdie of business writing."
5,"Memoirs of a great thinker, written by a great writer","Easy 5 stars. I place this book near the top of the list of auto-biographies I have read. Drucker provides (often humorous) descriptions and stories about himself and those around him as he grew into the business guru we know. He describes more his life as a writer and thinker than his business life. Very fun, inspiring read."
3,Poor Sound Quality,"This is a beautiful piece of music and a fun story that my kids love. Unfortunately, since this was recorded live, and not in a studio, the sound quality is poor. We have to turn the volume to a maximum level to hear it, which causes a problem when louder parts come up in the music."
1,You'll regret this purchase!,"I was so happy to find this recording in stock. Like another reviewer, I remembered this very version fondly from my childhood. I chose to believe the sound quality couldn't possibly be as bad as another reviewer said, but boy, was I wrong! To hear Mr. Hales terrific voice, we had to crank the volume up almost to our new Tweeter car stereo's maximum (though it was optimized for narration). But then the symphony comes in, and your eardrums bleed. It's horrendous. In the end we had to shut it off because our son found it too painful. I was really disappointed he missed out on this great story, but maybe Gramma still has the album. Oh well. :("
2,Tipsy Melting Pot,"I'm really glad I saw this in a local store before ordering. (I had it in my wish list to buy later.) Unfortunately, this is very top heavy, and tips over easily! That could make a bad mess. :("
4,Hand Pan,"I lke having a small pan that I can heat u some sauce for meat of mels butter to spread on food.I lkie th idea that I can use it on the barbque this summer, I will be a vers weel used pan."
5,Awesome size &function- super sweet melting pot!,This melting pot is a perfect size - it's adorable & functional. I absolutely love it - so many uses I didn't even think of.
5,Just as pictured,This was a purchase from someone's wish. It arrived on time and in great condition. It is just the right small size for a sauce.
2,bottom too small,"the concept is a good one.but the sides are slanted (so it looks like a scoop) instead of straight up like a pot. the bottom is too small; outer diameter is only ~6.5 cm, top inner diameter = 10.6 cm. (the standard household burners come in a diameter of 15 cm for the small size).as a result, even on the smaller burner, < 1/4 of the burner area is used. it takes too long to heat up, in the mean time, > 75% energy is wasted.i own several pieces of cookware by Lodge. this is the only one i am giving away."
3,Cute pot,"This melting pot is more cute than functional. It does melt butter for my popcorn real nice, but the base is so small it is a delicate balancing job to get it to sit on the stove grate. If you have an electric stove it may work great."
2,center of gravity,Great idea. Design . . . not so much. The base is too narrow and the thing tips from the weight of the handle. I melted butter in it and spilled butter into my hot grill. YUCK.
1,Useless: Not even big enough for a cup of coffee,This pot is TINY - it's not even big enough to heat a cup of coffee / yes maybe it can heat chocolate but it would require you to first powder the chocolate bar because a bar won't even fit in it
2,Correction...,"Actually, the Billie Strain 'song' is credited as being her. Whether she gets royalties or not is another matter.This album doesn't really do anything for me. Maybe it's the shonky writing or the shonky production. Maybe it's the fact that Kathleen Hanna, who I think is one of the most interesting people in the history of music, has been involved in music that's so much more emotionally involving and, well, better than this. While this album is by no means boring, I don't think it's one that I'd listen to repeatedly, and that's a bitter disappointment because, damnit, it's Kath Hanna."
3,Smaller and thinner than expected,These non-woven gauze sponges are 1.75 x 1.75 (not 2x2) finished size and very thin. If a smaller and much thinner than normal size works for you then you can't beat their pricing. I only paid $1.49/200 and would not pay more.
4,"Works well, but not as nice as the ones in the hospital",This gets the job done - we are using the gauze for our newborn baby - water w/ some vinegar - instead of chemical-laden baby wipes.
1,Horrible Quality and very cheap looking,I bought this costume for my 6 month old son. The material is very cheap looking and the costume looked like to already used. The materials made the costume look cheap and for the money it definitely was not worth it. My 2 year old niece could of made a better costume. So buyer. beware.
5,excellent,"It's sturdy, reliable and being sold at a bargain price. I can't believe how many pockets there are. Enough room to get everything I need inside, and more. I highly recommend purchasing the Targus Travel Notebook Case for all your laptop needs."
3,Good fun while it lasts.,"This album (which has finally been reissued) sounds pretty much how you would expect it to sound. It is a collection of 8 of the best known songs from the Grease soundtrack covered in Less Than Jake's quirky upbeat ska punk style. Despite the fairly weak production, it is all good fun and you will find yourself singing along with every word. My only problem is that at only 15 minutes in length it is a little short, but if you are a huge LTJ fan then I don't think you will be disappointed."
5,awesome,if you like grease and you like ltj you will love this album. its short but still amazing. i listen to it in my car on long trips it makes the time fly by.
2,Not their best,"I'm a huge LTJ fan, their one of my favorite ska bands next to the pilfers, but this I can honestly say isn't their best attempt. Personally, I don't think punk-ska and Broadway mix that well, and it's especially so with LTJ. Musically, it's some of their best, but the vocals is another thing. Roger and Chris aren't exactly John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John(which is good). If you have some extra money and you already have every other ska cd, might as well get it. But I would suggest that money would be better spent on Spring-Heeled Jack, or the Pilfers, or some other punk-ska band."
4,Tricks are for kids...,"Don't listen to a childs review,great songs,new sound.If you like Jake,you'll love this cd.If you love Grease,you'll at least like this cd.Cant lose..."
2,"Good idea, just done too fast.","""Wow! Less Than Jake covering Grease! Awesome!""Or so I thought. This is the most hastily arranged and recorded release I've ever heard in my life. The singing is off key, the guitars are sloppy, the band sounds unrehearsed . . . and there's only one song with horns. When LTJ ever starts to lack in any area, the horns always make it up for them. Not here. If they put any time into these songs at all, it could have been one of their best releases ever. But instead you get a short album that costs way too much full of complete hackneyed [stuff]."
3,Nostalgia,As a youth I sometimes encountered these drawings of Bill Mauldin in stray American magazines.This book I bought brought back memories.
3,Pure Explosion!,"Dave Hole is a hard rockin' blues man from Australia. If you haven't heard Hole yet, be prepared for no holds barred grating slide guitar not unlike that played by Eric Sardinas. No subtleties here, just chalkboard grating, hair raising, nerve crunching slide guitar. Hole slows down slightly for his cover of ""How Long?"" and ""Berwick Road"" but that's about it. The rest is all pedal to the metal. The cover's of Hendrix' ""Purple Haze"" and the 12 minute ""Bullfrog Blues"", done best by Rory Gallagher with his band Taste, are interesting at best. If you like to ""rawk"", this is your CD."
4,Great Value,"First, let me say that this is a great buy for the price. However, if you are a fan of midwest schools, they really don't give enough attention to these universities.I'm a Nebraska fan and they didn't even mention Osborne in the greatest coaches sections, and barely any of Bob Devaney who started it all. Texas is mentioned during the time of Darrel Royal and Oklahoma is discussed during Bud Wilkenson's tenure. Barry Switzer's tenure is pretty much completely left out. Its very centered with the eastern schools, USC and Notre Dame. If you love college football in general than it will be a great buy, but it is very unbalanced in its coverage."
4,Good partner for the Book,"I have the book so I purchased the DVD set to go with it; I am very pleased with this addition to my collection. I only have 1 gripe about this, which is the reason why I didn't go with 5 stars, and that is as usual items such as these are only in Region 1 mode. Until such time as items such as this become available on multiple Regions I will have to continue to keep a Region 1 player available for DVDs I purchase from the US."
1,ripped off!!!!,"Thought I was buying the 5 disc set and when I got the package it conted 1 disce, volume 7 & 8. No where in description did it say I was getting just 1 of the 5 dvds."
4,Brilliant artist,"This is a wonderful album full of beautiful, melodic songs, a very tasteful backing band on some songs, Patty's great guitar work, her haunting voice (with occasional overdubbed harmonies), her smart lyrics ... in short, the album is great.I saw Patty live in NYC a couple of weeks ago. She was terrific, was a riot between songs, the audience was enraptured. She is an incredible artist, deserves better recognition, and this CD will not disappoint."
2,No Comment ...,"I loved Perishable Fruit, and the HDCD encoding makes it even better. But this CD got traded in the day after I bought it. Just way too ""out there"". Sorry Patty !"
4,A Great Read,"Shadow Flights examines an already well-covered subject with rich detail and plenty of new information. The reader gets the ""feel"" of the pilots' experience flying these dangerous missions and offers interesting details about flights over China that aren't covered nearly as much by other works on the subject.Peebles has always been one of the best writers on intelligence matters, in my opinion, and Shadow Flights is no exception. It's definitely worth the read."
2,Air Intake duct replacement,"I promptly received the item after ordering. However, it is not a Dorman brand as stated. The brand on the box was ""Air Intake Hoses"". It came in a package with part #1385012 as well as the Toyota part number 1788162040 that it replaces. It was a perfect fit as far as dimensions. It is made in China."
5,Delicious and thought provoking,"The combination of Jesuit Brother and Bread is an unusual one on the surface but reading Brother Curry's book, you realise what a key role communal eating plays in the life of the Church.Even if the closest to religion you have ever been is walking past a Nativity scene in a mall, the stories of Jesuit life are inspiring.The recipes are simple to follow (no six day starters or special equipment here!) and are delicious. The seasonal breads are a perfect for presents or greedy home consumption!"
5,Great Album,"This is a great Christmas album with all my favorite singers in it! If you love Christmas music, this is one to have!"
3,It's alright,"Very good looking shoe, but too bulky for my liking. If I had known that it was that heavy, would not have purchased. They ought to mention online that the shoe is heavy - otherwise the look on computer is deceiving. However, its good looks help to make a style statement, if you want to buy it just for that. don't recommend it that much - unless you work in a club or bar, and need that edge in a shoe."
5,VERY COMFORTABLE AND NICE LOOKING SANDALS,"These shoes are everyhting I was expecting, very comfy and good looking with jeans ans skirts."
4,SWEET AND REFRESHING,"Long recognized as makers of elegrant, luxurious jewelry Boucheron began in 1830 when the first store opened in Paris. It was not until 1988 that the first Boucheron fragrance was launched.One of their latest fragrances is Boucheron Initial which was introduced just four years ago. It is an enchanting blend of sweetness and natural fruit enhanced by vanilla. It's a fragrance one wears all day every day and never tires of the scent.Boucheron remains in family hands today, the president being the founder's great-grandson, Alain Boucheron. To me, that bespeaks pride in and attention to product. Both of which benefit the consumer."
5,Great Soundtrack,I had never heard of this movie.... but when it came on cable I had to watch it because my brother is in it (played the gamewarden) The soundtrack was so out of this world that I had to have it. I want to believe in a world with Circus Monkey in it.
3,Have a previous edition of this book.,"I took architectural drafting in college some 19 years ago and this was the book used for the classes. I purchased this edition hoping to get a book more current on subject matter. I was disappointed to find the same drawings used to illustrate drafting concepts in both books. I would have thought the authors would have used more complex designs to demonstrate different drafting methods. For example, there are no illustration of monolithic slab foundations in the book. Conventional foundation with basement is the preferred methods discussed in the book. (And this hasn't changed in 20 years.)Don't read this as a reason not to purchase to book. I've referred back to this book many times over the years when I've had architectural drafting projects. It's still a great reference. I just wish the example floor plans were more current with the preferred designs of today and there were more varied examples discussed."
5,Good book,I bought this book for my class at a junior college. There are a lot of useful information for residential planning.It covers almost everything but I wish it can go futher more in details. This book is not only for students but also for anyone who interesting in residential planning.
2,Interesting but not well-written.,"A fun book but there are many errors. I still found it an interesting read but can't recommend it without reservations. A second edition, with careful editing, would be much more entertaining (since some of the facts are glaringly incorrect*) and I'm surprised that previous reviewers said it was well-written. *(I started making penciled corrections in a library book!)"
3,Well done book that is mostly accurate,"Tom Bergeron teamed up with David Hofstede to write this and the result is good. It mentions embarressments like Dusty's Trail (Bob Denver's post Gilligan flop series) and Cousin Oliver adding to the Brady Bunch and the switching of Darrins on Bewitched. I appreciate the rather factual dates given for when these shows aired. Lots of photographs of the shows too. Just one thing, when reviewing Dark Shadows it says (if I recall) that Barnabas is 240 (or around there). Huh? Barnabas was more like around 204 on DS when we first saw him."
3,Different for Girls...Who Used to Be Boys,"This is what some would call a ""slight"" movie. Unlike the more recent ""transgender"" film ""Boys Don't Cry,"" ""Different for Girls"" is not meant to be downer. It has its heavier moments, to be sure, but unlike the very American, very somber ""Boys,"" ""Girls"" is lighter fare, complete with a sly turnabout and a happy enough ending--and veddy British. Like ""Boys,"" however, it is extremely well directed, with top-notch performances by Steven Mackintosh and Rupert Graves. Saskia Reeves is among the several fine performers in supporting roles.""Different for Girls"" might serve as a perfect double bill for a heavier hitting, but similarly themed film, such as the aforementioned ""Boys Don't Cry"" or ""The Crying Game."" Run it second if you prefer closing your evening on an up-note."
2,Stupid and unrealistic.,"I would never recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 50. This movie makes immoral suggestions, and was hard to follow. The movie did not make a lot of sence to me. The plot had so many holes. The thought was interesting, and the idea of making a movie with this setting was a new and different idea. However, the scripting could be a little better. The casting was good, however."
5,"ROMANCE, WIT, AND INTELLIGENCE","Viewers will have to seek out this film, when, in fact, films of such quality should be all over the media. I rented this as a VHS tape when it was current, and I find that many years later, it still exudes the same intelligence and charm. Rupert Graves is irresistible, and his love interest gives a winning performance, also. Foreign films are so much more mature than most of the mundane pablum coming from the United States."
4,"Pleasant, informative, but not totally convincing","A needed, pleasant and reflective vindication of my own journey, yet could have possessed so much more punch and ""physical realism"", if not required to film ""personal"" scene in dark shadows, if casted with an actual professional-actor transsexual. However, I would recommend it as a tasteful eye-opening, in defiance of all the negative sensationalism perpetrated by the arch-damager of all transgendered persons, Jerry Springer, and others of his sloven-stripe."
2,"Good acting, decent script, just not my cup of tea","Different for Girls is an interesting film. It is well acted and well directed. However, I don't know that it is a film for everyone. It deals with the subject of post ""change"" of a transgendered person and how they try to fit in to society. It is quite touching and sensitive. Steven Mackintosh is quite good as the transgendered person and Rupert Graves is dynamite as he is in everything he does.If there is a problem with this film, it's that it seems to be preaching a bit more than I think it should. I'd rather see it less a drama and more ""a day in the life of"" sort of film."
3,Nicely Done But....,"....the fact that the energy is very sporadic is noticeable and spoils it.However, hats off to Stephen Mackintosh who is very good as the very feminine and complicated Kim. The mannerisms are pretty good and he plays her with sensitivity, understanding and charm.Rupert Graves isn't bad either as her chaotic schooldays friend Prentice who runs into her by coincidence and finds himself having to deal with the fact that he is falling in love with his former best friend who used to be a boy."
2,"Maybe it won't shatter, but the bottom will fall off!","We haven't dropped one of these glasses yet, so I can't speak to their durability, but there is a design flaw that bothers me. The glasses come in two parts, one of which is a round disc that attaches to the bottom of the glass. The disc doesn't screw on to the upper half of the glass, you just have to push it really, really hard. We pushed it really, really hard, then I washed the glass and the bottom fell off in my hand. I envision a lot of spilled wine ..."
2,A Nice plastic Glass,"It's a nice plastic glass, but still a plastic glass. I ordered on to see how it felt in the hand. It feels like any plastic glass."
2,The Reluctant Debutante,Watching the movie was blurry. It seemed to me that someone taped this off the tv and it was poor quality.
1,DVD will not play,"This is one of my all time favorite films and I was thrilled to find it on DVD. I am extremely disappointed however, that it will not play it on either of my DVD players (connected to televisions) nor will it play on either of my computers. When I contacted the company I was told that there must be a problem with my DVD players/computers. I find it hard to believe that both of my DVD players and both of my computers are defective! This is only only DVD I have ever had a problem with. Will never do business with this company again!"
5,Superb example of 1950s cinema delight,"Sure it's slightly cheesy sometimes, but why else would we watch these kinds of films if not the desire to sit back, relax, and escape reality for a moment? The Reluctant Debutante definitely allows for this and a few laughs as we watch Sandra Dee find her own place in London society and Rex Harrison finding his place as her father after an absence.A simple, delightful film."
3,So so game,"Chromehounds is fine if you really like the mech genre. I'm finding out that I may not really like the mech genre, and this game is helping me solidify that. I've also played Mech Warrior, and I am getting basically the same thing with Chromehounds. Shooting things and blowing them up is fun, of course. However, the environments aren't that interesting. I think the thing about mech games is that they are all one dimensional. You move your mech around and shoot stuff. That's it. I am so tempted to get Armored Core 4, but I am holding back. I so want to love this genre, but I can't. Darn!"
3,Chromehounds,"game had a lot of potential, but is sadly held back by multiple glaring problems. mission objectives are often vague at best. missions range from almost too easy, to hair tearing hard."
1,DO NOT BUY - servers offline,"Sadly, this was an acceptable game with many flaws that was sort of fun. Until they crippled it completely by shutting down the servers. Now it's completely unplayable. You cannot even use the mechs you built with online parts because now all your parts are gone. You can't play with friends, because there is are no servers. You can't even host your own game because they didn't think that far ahead. You can't get 1000 gamer points because there is no online service.It was maybe 2.5 stars before. I'd give it 0 stars if I could"
1,Horrible support. GG sega,"If you want your Xbox 360 to get the ""ring of death"" or whatever or freeze up while playing, then by all means buy this game. I hop on Xbox live and can't even play with my squadmates because the freezing is so bad. Also disconnects and other lockup issues are crippling to this game. DO NOT BUY THIS. Last game I will ever buy from Sega."
3,New 360 game missed again,"Call it a 3.5. The game is good enough with decent sound and the graghics at times are very good, but I don't think they are up to the 360. I cannot vouch for the online play, I'll leave that to others. But, for those of us who like a good single player game (not online) or to play co-op (offline) it ain't there. I love the fact that you can play any of the hounds and do each one through the limited single player game, but there really is no single player game, much less co-op. There really is no story line and it is over in about an hour or so. I was really dissapointed in that part of it. So if you're like most and only want to play online you'll probably like it, but if you are hunting for a good campaign game pass it by for now. One way or the other I'd wait for the price to go down if I had it to do over again."
3,could have been much better,"why does Microsoft do this?!!!! all these games coming out on 360 could have been on Xbox!! graphics! please, average game"
5,IT WORKS!,I recieved one of these for a gift. And was very not real excited about it until I started using it. Every tool on this works and works well. I'm a machinist and I know quality tools this is real quality.
4,Great Travel tool,"I work on photoshoots all over the world and this thing is better than the swiss army knife (which you also need). I have bent wire, made hangers, done minor surgery on a injured foot all with this tool!"
3,You've lost your way.,"""Los Gusanos"" is Spanish for ""The Worms"". Los Gusanos is also a band featuring CJ Ward (formerly CJ Ramone of the Ramones). CJ is the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist. The band has more of a ""metal"" sound than a ""punk"" sound, which was a disappointment to me. The songs aren't all that memorable, either. An okay CD, but I suspect that other Ramones fans will also be disappointed in it."
4,Wonderful!,"Wow, it is amazing what people find in storerooms! This is a great compilation of Skip James music that supposedly has never been released until now. I enjoy the album very much, Skip is a master of the Delta Blues. The music is soulfull and presented in a way that can only be acheived by Skip. My one dissappointment was that I didn't hear much of his wonderful guitar work on this release. It is primarily a piano album. The recording quality is pretty good for that era, though not up to todays standards.That said, I recommend newcomers get his Complete Recorded Works first for the best intro into Skip James' music. However, if you have that and other recordings already, get this to complete your collection and satiate that Skip fix."
3,Not What I Expected,"I am new to the tablet world so I didn't receive what I thought which is due to my own lack of knowledge. The pointer is about the size of an eraser head with rounded edges so the line output is quit thick. I was hoping for something you could ""write"" with in a finer line. This is really just a tool to replace your finger so I don't see any real use for it unless you don't have a finger or you just don't want to deal with finger prints on the screen. I would think having to remember to bring it along with you or chance of losing it would outway any value it brings, but that is just my own personal opinion. Needless to say, I don't really use it."
5,Used for a DigiTech JML2 JamMan Stereo Looper,"To get the full functionality out of the JamMan, my son needed this switch.Like all of the DigiTech pedals and switches, this one is well-built and sturdy.My son is still integrating the use of the JamMan into his music and it and the three-button switch have only just been added to his pedal board. But we expect this combo to last YEARS."
1,This drive is too easy to lose! Beware of bad design...,"I had mine for 1 week before it fell off the keychain shell and is now lost with my data. It is not permanently attached to the swivel shell. Only buy this if you are NOT going to take it with you. Also, record the serial number which is on the drive itself so that they may replace it for you if you do lose it. The barcode is useless and the s/n is not anywhere else."
2,Does not give the gender of nouns,"I bought this to help with my French studies prior to moving to Paris. I quickly discovered that the translations do NOT give you the gender of nouns. If you have ever studied French (or German, Italian, Spanish...), you know how important this is.If your intended use is trying to figure out the meaning of words on a sign or menu, this will serve you well. If you are trying to actually learn the language, look elsewhere.I will be returning this item."
5,Flatware,"The Pfaltzgraff flatware is great and is pretty much what I expected from the photos. I was surprised at how large the forks and tablespoons are but they're fine in use. Everything is sturdy, pretty and festive, which is what I wanted. I also bought the dishes, wineglasses, and serving dishes, and everything is a perfect match."
4,"People ""get"" TOC at different levels","This book separates those readers who get TOC at a deep level from those who don't. It's not easy reading because it makes you think -- hard at times. But if you stick with it and really comprehend it, the last section is just as valuable as the first two."
3,"Damn, where's that needle?","I'm an IT guy. I'm a huge fan of the theory of constraints (TOC) series by Goldratt. Then why do I give this book only three stars?When I picked up the book I was happy to go and read it. After reading The Critical Chain I was somewhat disappointed, but this new book was all about my thing... IT.The book reads the same as the other ones in the series, but it does not cover the excitement you had when reading them. Maybe as an IT guy I expected this book to be of great help and learn me some new stuff, but it basically states what every automation professional should preach: IT gives you the tools that make processes more efficient and profitable.There, I just summarized the book for you. Still not convinced and an addict of the series? Then grab yourself a copy."
3,Heavy going,"I am a huge fan of Goldratt and have got good results applying his ideas. This book is valuable, but only to those who have ready the more accessible books and thought about the content for quite a while. Definitely not an entry level Theory of Constraints primer.In part that is because of the writing style, which is full of CAPITALISED TERMS which make the text HARD to read."
3,The Haystack Syndrome,"The Haystack Syndrome provides more detail than other books by Dr. Goldratt, especially in the area of optimizing the constraint through an example the reader is to work through, as well as information on identification of the constraints. Unfortunately this book is one of Dr. Goldratt's harder books to read and understand, even with a moderate understanding of T.O.C.I would recommend the Haystack Syndrome for anyone already familiar with T.O.C., who is looking for a deeper understanding of the thinking process. For those who are just starting out, I would suggest reading some of Dr. Goldratt's novels first."
1,A disappointing re-hash of Goldratt's ideas,"This is a sloppy mess of a book. Poorly written, repetitive, full of irritating conversational tics, it is a poor source for students of Goldratt's innovative thinking on manufacturing systems. I picked it up second-hand since it is out of print, but now regret it. There are much better books on TOC, information systems design and scheduling."
2,"Good start, noisy and confusing finish","Goldratt starts the book with a solid and useful explanation of TOC. After that, however, he wanders into trying to derive the information needed to drive a business and the information reporting structures required to support the business. This is where he lost my attention as his examples and derivations just seemed to wander without point."
2,One good book?,"""TELL ME HOW YOU MEASURE ME, AND I WILL TELL YOU HOW I WILL BEHAVE.""OK, we expect you to publish on your theory frequently.Um, but I have nothing new to say. The theory was only big enough for one book.We won't consider you an expert if you have only one good book - the first one.OK. I'll rehash everything about every two years."
2,"yes, but no","Everything you've ever wanted to know about Baum's Oz career, written, alas, by a perfectly dreadful stylist who can't synthesize information, can't shape a thought, and, basically, can't write.The photos are nifty, though."
2,Are We All Reading The Same Book????,"I won't give anything away, but at one point the guy in the story is looking for his dog in his house and it takes at least 3 pages front and back to find him!!! He has other scenerios too where it takes forever for them to play out. Then they play out to a dead end. When the next scenerio came about I knew I was being taken for a long ride to no where.I read Frankenstein and The Face which he wrote, and they were good. This book almost made me feel as if he didn't write it. Yeah, it had that bizarre factor to it, but there was something missing. I mean, I could skip 3-4 pages and not miss anything in the book's plot. That's not good!I also have his second book out, the sequal, Seize the Night, but I wonder if I should really even begin to read it if it is any way similar to Fear Nothing. I can only hope that whatever problems came about with Fear Nothing with this Chris Snow do not reappear in Seize the Night, because if they do, I'm outta here!"
1,"Garbage...literally , I threw it in my garbage","Admittedly, this is/was my first attempt at reading Koontz. I normally don't read this type of fiction, but wanted to try something light and he is an author whose name I've heard a lot but never read.If ever there were an argument to be made for book burning 'Fear Nothing' is it. It will better serve you getting your fireplace started, or possibly propping up a wobbly table at the annual Spaghetti Dinner held by your local Knights of Columbus.This reads like the first draft of something written over a sleepless weekend by some tool who read some horror novel and was suddenly inspired to pursue writing."
3,Fear Nothing - Not bad,"This book in general tends to be slow at times but, is interesting enough to keep you reading. There are very few books I give five stars so keep that in mind. As one of the few books by Koontz I've read or have been reading it isn't bad."
3,Decent.. but not Great,"I'm a HUGE Dean Koontz fan but this book didn't quite do it for me. The beginning was good but then I just don't know what happened. And this being part of a trilogy.. I don't have time for that. Being that I'm a fan of Koontz, I will try other books by him but this one, nah! Time to give it away to charity."
3,I'm sorry this was not his best,"I love Dean Koontz's novels. I have found that he rarely uses that same central theme in his story as other authors: Example Jack Higgins (great writer) but how many stories deal with a document in a briefcase , in a plane at the bottom of the ocean and it's revealing will be catstrphophic to the world? Too many. But this book by Mr. Koontz has Watchers blended in with the Island of Dr Moreau.I can't place my finger on it, but the suspense seemed forced. ""You need to know...."" a couple pages later. ""You need to know..."" again , but that was it. This is unlike his other stories where the suspense seems to flow with the pages and the events. He seemed to have created them.Sorry, not that good. But hey, I did spend the money and bought it. I'll always read his material unless it become redundant."
5,Another winner from the king.......,"Mr. Koontz has done it again. Although not his scariest book to date, he has raised his prose to a new level with more characters we empathize with, and plot development that keeps the pages turning. It's as if he took the cast of ""Planet of the Apes"" and turned them into a street gang. I'm just disappointed that we Koontz fans will have to wait another year for the next one."
2,weirdo walks by night with his animal pals,"If you liked Watchers by Dean Koontz, don't read Fear Nothing. You'll be very disappointed.A daylight impaired hero, his cardboard girlfriend, and his noble canine companion. The dog is by far the most interesting character.A quick nod to Invasion of the Body Snatchers, a few psycho cops, a surfer dud (whoops, dude) with rilly rilly bad dialogue and of course, something EVIL going on in the old lab down the road. Don't bother, just go read Watchers again."
2,"Fear Nothing, Dean Koontz, eBook","The story was OK, though I prefer Odd Thomas... The problem was the eBook / Kindle edition was almost painful to read due to the double spaced lines. Blech...UPDATE....I was very new to Kindle when I wrote the above review and now know how to adjust line spacing. Still not overly impressed with the story, but I'm so taken with Odd Thomas that it may well be biasing my opinions of other work by Mr. Koontz."
2,Fear this,"Dean Koontz does write very suspensful books and creates good characters. Yet this book is'nt suspensful and the characters are perfect examples of modern morality. This is anouther one of Dean's book's where he is fantasising about being a 28 year old cool dude. Yet I don't know where he gets the idea that the banter he creates between characters is 'cool'. Koontz idea of what is popular and right makes me sick at times, merely for the complete simplisity of this man's world veiw. You read Koontz for suspense, to forget about the world and immerse yourself in his well developed characters. None of this happened in Fear Nothing!"
4,Entertaining,"There were times that Koontz tends to ramble on about a subject. If one can get through that, the plot was fantastic. Really makes one think how much of this story is true. Definitely one to read before bed."
2,be prepared to do lots of skimming,"I have read many of Dean Koontz's books, and have enjoyed most of them, even though a lot of his novels story lines are so similiar you have a hard time remembering which story line was from which novel. Fear nothing had all the classic Koontz ingredients: A young aspiring writer, his love interest, his ""chuffing"" dog, and a government conspiracy. This novel just didn't cut it for me. I found myself speed reading most of it, too much description and scene setting."
2,Beware! 5 star ratings are from wyvern mutants.,"The most fearful thing about this book are the 5 star ratings. I've been more frightened by cartoons. I have to admit I liked the story line, but there was very little tension to keep this story moving. ""Watchers"" and ""Intensity"", this book is not."
2,Not the greatest,"I have read a few books by Dean Koontz and I expected the same standard to be applied to this book as was to the ones I had read before. Fear Nothing is nowhere near as good as his others. It's OK but if you want Koontz, try any of his others"
2,BUMMER DUD!,"Too different for me. The surfer stuff bugged me. Give me the old Koontz style. But I do have something positive to say. I bought two books from Amazon last month, and the other one was killer! It's called, 'The Fist of God' by A.T. Nicholas. It's an awesome 'good against evil' story with some cool twists. This book has a great plot and sub-plots. I was very happy with this book."
1,"I'm still waiting for the ""Daylights to be scared out of me""","I was given this book by a coworker, who highly recommended it. I kept reading to the end, in hopes of finding what she found so thrilling in it. I was very disappointed, to say the least. I did find the humor given to Christopher Snow, made the book more enjoyable, along with his view of his limitations, enlightening. I was left feeling two days of my time lost in reading too many boring, monotonous details. The author could have left out over half the details, cut to the chase, and written half the book, and MAYBE, it would have been more enjoyable."
2,"Adventurous at the beggining, and then a slow paced climax!","This book was very disappointing! It lacked intensity, and could've had a better storyline. It took you so high in the beggining,that you had no place left to go but down. Very bad first impression!"
3,Not up to par,"I am a big fan of Koontz's but this book failed me on several points: the plot is pretty simple, and there is way too much casual conversation that has nothing to do with the story; it's too short (see point #1); and, why did the main character have to have such a weird disease (and will probably die young). Reminded me a lot of Iceburg (I think that's the name). It seemed like a ""crank it out"" type story, as opposed to Intensity and Dark Rivers of the Heart where he literally shone."
3,Boooorrrinngggg,"Slightly too detailed...how many pages does it take to explain that Snowman walked 20 feet? How many monkeys does it take to write a novel??? I love his books, but spare me the time and spare earth the trees!"
3,Is Dean too busy to crank the best novels anymore?,"Are my tastes changing or have Dean's last two novels petered out after gripping starts? Intensity was so riveting. However, Sole Survivor and Fear Nothing have been relatively unsatisfying. The clever dialogue and good characters are there. The familiar elements of Koontz's other stories are there as well. I guess it's some predictability of the plot, as well as unsatisfying resolution of the plot. Is Dean too busy with his movie script writing to write great books instead of good ones, or is his heart involved too much now in the screen writing to really pour his soul into his novels? Let's hope that he can make a new beginning with his next book. I'm not particularly in love with these characters and wouldn't mind discarding them in favor of new ones. The threat to see them in future novels makes me uneasy."
4,A good start to what could potentially be a great series,"This book isn't half as bad as alot of people on this page have been saying. Granted, the plot is highly derivitive of Watchers. But, and this to me is very important, Koontz's writing STYLE has never been better. He is today's modern master of the English language, bar none. The narrator's point of view was just terrific to behold-Chris Snow has a great personality. And as for this book being scary-the scene involving the dolls in the home of Snow's nurse is probably one of the eeriest scenes I've encountered in a Koontz book yet. What Koontz needs to do now is focus as much of his creative energy on the PLOTS of his novels as he does on character. If he makes this adjustment, the next 2 books in this trilogy should turn out to be instant classics."
2,Fear nothing as bsd as tick tick tick thats bad.,To much nonscence it just go'es on and on and there is nothing to the story. you don't know much more when you're finished than you did at the start.
3,Not his greatest ; not his worst.,"After seeing that the reviews of FEAR NOTHING range from 10 all the way down to 1, I feel better about my feelings about the novel. After reading reviews of it, I thought it would be a ""can't stop reading it"" kind of book. Not so. It took me a while to get started; finally, however, it began to pick up momentum and I finished it fairly quickly. I didn't get the enjoyment from this novel that I have from some of Koontz's others. Maybe I was expecting too much. Also, the ending left me hanging; maybe it's because there are more adventures of Chris, Bobby, Sasha, and Orson to come. Come on, Dean, give us what you used to!"
2,"This was a ""wanna-be-like-Chricton"" all the way through.","I kept thinking through this entire novel Koontz was trying to one-up Chricton on technical and social commentary. Entertaining to a point, but the surfer stuff was getting a little ridiculous. I prefer a great deal of ""well, maybe that could happen"", but this had something missing. Certainly, Koontz is a talented writer with many accomplishments. Try another Koontz before this one."
5,I will never look at animals the same way again.,"Fear Nothing is the most gripping book I have read since Intensity. Christopher Snow is the bravest character I have met, I wanted to hide and never enter the night again, yet he continued to go into the darkness. I was frightened by the thought of what would happen next, when he would be attacked by the monkeys, or some other being. I wanted to stop, yet could not put the book down until I knew that Christopher was safe. From page one to page 432 I was hooked and couldn't wait for the next adventure with Christopher and Orson. Exciting, Thrilling, Compelling !!!! The best! I don't think my heart has pounded so much, or have ever just wanted to enter a book and rescue the character like I did Christopher Snow."
4,Koontz is Back On Track!,"After having been disappointed with a couple of his more recent works, Fear Nothing, has me firmly back in the Koontz fold. I enjoyed it's similarity to Watchers (which still remains with Lightning my two favs) and really liked the Chris Snow character. Anyone who has ever had a dog, can't help but like Orson. Some other reviewers have commented that the book was too wordy, a little-I have to agree, hence the 4 not 5 stars. But I managed to read it in one sitting, not easy to do with two little ones running around. Looking forward to the sequel, which apparently came out yesterday. Think I'll get that one in hardcover."
3,"Slow start, strong finish",I strongly agree with some of the other reviews that I have read. Fear Nothing is slow to start but it turns into a real jewel!! Must Read!!
3,"Not one of the best, but OK.","He's had others that were better, that moved along a little swifter, but it was intersting. A good book for all the x-filers out there. And it appears from his new book this is turning into a series, so it could develop into a rather engrossing story."
2,disappointing,"This, in my opinion, is the least interesting and most contrived novel Dean Koontz has written to date. Neither the story nor the characters were believable, in contrast to many of his earlier works. Inconsistencies abound. For example, the main character is described as not knowing much about firearms, and later in the story proceeds to describe a certain weapon and its characteristics in detail. I usually enjoy Mr. Koontz's technical explanations, but I don't think he researched the scientific nuances for this plot very carefully. Also, I think he would do well to have main characters closer to his own age. Despite all this, as a loyal fan, I will purchase his next novel as soon as it appears."
1,Don't waste your time or money...,A story that was scattered without the first hint of mystery. I turned the pages because I believed the story was bound to take off at some point...I was wrong.
4,Not to bad,"I am in the process of reading this book after much hemming and hawing over whether or not I wanted to. I spent a long time going over other people's reviews here on Amazon before I finally borrowed it from a friend. Although I admit that it is not one of his absolute best, I do not find it to be as blatently boring as many people insist. I guess as the saying goes... ""You can't please all of the people all of the time..."" The plot has kept me intrigued and I can not wait to see what happens at the end. My only fear is that Dean Koontz will read all this negative feedback and decide ""Hell with it!"" If this is indeed to be a three part story then wait till all three books are out and read before passing judgement on just the first one."
3,What a disappointment.,"I've read Koontz before, and unfortunately this book does not measure up to his former efforts. While Koontz is a talented writer and craftsman, in this book he didn't even interest me, never mind frighten me. The premise is intriguing, and I did like the main character; however, I wanted more action and less detailed description of everything from the California coastline to friend Bobby's bathroom. I think Koontz has written so many novels that he has gotten bored, and to amuse himself, he loads his work with metaphors and similes, some of which are clever, but many of which do not work at all. I'm going back to his old works."
4,Orson-- a superb hero!!!!!,This book was interesting with its twisted plot. It had a mediocre ending that gave no real conclusion.
4,Above Average,"This was the second Dean Koontz novel I have read - ""False Memory,"" being the first. While I found the book compelling, it was almost too ""fantasy-like,"" all the way down to the characters. Chistopher Snow was almost too much of a hero.Nevertheless I found it to be excellent vacation-reading - when you just want to relax and escape. Koontz is an engaging author and I am eager to read some of his other works."
3,Not my favorite,"I have been reading Koontz for years, and this particular novel could do virtually nothing to catch my interest. While some of the scientific interludes were interesting, I felt that Koontz waited much too long to indulge his readers in the odd biological and scientific theories that make his novels so popular.On a lighter note, I would say read the novel anyway. We all have our favorites, and just because some of the reviews say it was not worth the read, doesn't mean that you won't enjoy it. The story did have its highlights, and I found it entertaining - just no captivating. Read it and make up your own mind."
4,Scary suspense,"This is really a page turner, though too many episodes are crammed into one night. The sequence becomes wearing, and the constant fear wears thin to this reader who is not usually a reader of fear-focussed novels. The situation is intriguing however. I read it because I recently moved from the east coast to live near Half-Moon Bay and I was curious about local color. This was so realistic and convincing that I think I'll order a home security service!"
4,Very Koontz-y,"Some Koontz books are incredible, some are okay, and some are a turnoff. ""Fear Nothing"" is classic Koontz - eerie, atmospheric, informed by a sense of right and wrong. FN is also uneven; Koontz has a tendency to go on and on, grinding the action to a halt, and he does that more than once in this book. And there is also the requisite revolting psychotic character although for once, this guy only talks about it but doesn't actually do anything. (Note to Mr. Koontz: I could really do with less of the gross-out psycho stuff and more of the psychological creepiness.) But otherwise, the characters are as likable as all Koontz protagonists, the story is intriguing, and the animals make you long for such creatures in your own life. (The GOOD animals, anyway.) The story veered way past ""unlikely"" and well into ""not believable"" more than once but I didn't mind because, overall, it was a darn good tall tale. I recommend it."
4,My first Koontz book - coming from a Stephen King fan,"Good story. It could have been longer and gone into more detail about the history of Wyvern and the characters' parents. I am used to King books which can be very long. This book definitely sucked me in, and I am going to read ""Seize the Night"" next."
2,Fear Something- This Book,"I am actually a big fan of Dean Koontz's work. Unfortunately, many times I find his writing to be uneven. One book will blow me away, and the next will have me vowing that I will never read one of his books again. Fear Nothing falls into the latter category. This book is just too boring and predictable. If this had been my first time reading Koontz, I'm not so sure there would have been a second time. If you want to read a Dean Koontz book try Phantoms or Whispers. Only after reading one of those far superior books will you be able to forgive Koontz for this one. Skip Fear Nothing and come back to it after you have read all of Koontz's other work. Better yet re-read them all a second time and save yourself the bother of this one."
2,Fear Something,"Fear this book. Once again Koontz foists his own paranoid ""the goverment is out to get us"" fantasies on his readers. This book is full of tortured metaphors and hollow sounding ""surfer speak"". If not for the dog, Orson, the thing would be a total loser. As it stands it's packed full of useless musings and slow-paced ""tension building"" that could easily be cut. As it stands the book is bloated by 200 pages.Fear this book. Buy something else."
2,Fear nothing because nothing happens,"Suspense lingers too much as promised in the cover reviews so one turn pages and pages expecting a twist but nothing happens. The development of the main character Chris is fantastic but the story is dull and not gripping, nevertheless there are very good reflections about life and human condition. No more Koonz for me"
4,A Koontz Hit!,"I agree with previous reviewers that have said recent Koontz (like the last 5 or so years) has been hit and miss. But Fear Nothing is a definite HIT in my opinion! Christopher Snow is a deep, emotional character and Koontz does a brilliant job of painting his motivations and the things that compel him to action or cause him reluctance and doubt.Other characters are painted less vividly, but that allows Snow to take center stage, as it should be in my opinion.I loved this story and I think anyone who loves character-driven stories will be drawn into Christopher Snow's predicament."
3,"Average, Koontz could have done a lot more with this one","I was slightly disapointed with this book. It started out slow and got a little better. The ending was amusing and I could wait to get my hands on ""Seize the Night"", hoping it would be better. I was wrong. In my opinion, ""Seize the Night"" was even worst! Koontz just drags and drags. Read Strangers or Watchers instead."
1,Boring,"This book was extremely boring. Usually the first few pages of Dean Koontz books catch my attention, however....I thought this one just had a slow start and might pick up. Never Happened!! It was boring from begining to end!!"
3,Major disappoinment,"I've read all or koontz's books and this is one of the worse. Chris Snow seems to gather information by osmosis -- with just a little information he's able to piece the story together. I guess because Koontz is planning a second book he couldn't tie up the loose ends, but I was left wanting more (more explanation, more closure, whatever)."
3,Not of his past writings.,"Upon reading this book, I found I wasn't into the story until nearly the end. There is usually a great deal of action right up front. The character (Chris) wasn't fully explained in detail (his disease) and therefor my husband and myself enpictured him STILL as an albino with the little detail we received. Dean has always been unique and when I ended this story and found it is ""continued"" so to speak in another book, it reminded me a lot of Stephen King who is another of my favorites, but given Dean's uniqueness, it sort of popped the balloon on creativity."
2,I am still amazed at how shallow and plotless this book was.,I am one of Dean Koontz most avid reader. I have always bought his books without even reading what it was about. This book has me in shock still...it was so drawn out and dull I didn't even wish to finish it cause I really didn't care what happened to the main character. I will let this one slid by and remain a loyal reader but please Mr. Koontz write like Mr. Dean Koontz.
1,not worth the time or money,"I have read all of Dean Koontz's books and I must say that this is by far the worst by him that I've ever read (yes, worse than Tick-Tock). Normally a superb author, Koontz just really didn't seem to put much effort into this novel, which left me exasperated to say the least. If you want a good thriller from Koontz don't read this, try Watchers or Strangers instead."
2,You can't see the story for the description.,"I love Dean Koontz. I have read everything he has done. BUT, this one was a challenge for me. There was so much description that it was hard to get into the story. I know that Christopher Snow, Bobby Halloway, Sasha Goodall and Orson are real (as per the authors note)and there could have been a very good story here but I lost interest when Mr. Koontz kept describing every little thing. Please Mr. Koontz, cut back on the filler and give us more of the subject matter."
2,Not in my top 10 of Koontz books,"Dean Koontz is my absolute favorite writer, but I was dissapointed with ""Fear Nothing"". I missed the ""thriller"" factor, and to be in suspense till the final pages. I have the impression this is more a ""routine"" job than the other Koontz novels. My favorites are ""Lightning"" and ""Strangers"". Luc, Belgium"
4,Absorbing read.,"This is not ""Intensity""!! No doubt many readers bought ""Fear Nothing"" thinking this would contain the fast-paced thrill ride ""Intensity"" was. Instead, ""Fear Nothing"" is a solemn journey through a small, strangely tweaked town on the California coast. Koontz's descriptive narration is especially inviting as it takes the reader deeper into the mind of the lead character Chris Snow, while also throwing in a few high suspense moments. Yes, there are many aspects of the plot that are quite similar to past Koontz books. But those similarities are the characteristics of Koontz's books I find especially worth reading. I recommend reading this book with the knowledge that this is a story...not a carnival ride."
2,A Very Disapointing Introduction to Dean Koontz's Works,"This was my first introduction to the writings of Dean Koontz. After the first few chapters I was bored and put the book away. Thought it was a waste of time. Having read several reviews of his other works, especially ""Watchers"" I bit the bullet and deceided finish ""Fear Nothing"". Perhaps I was not familiar with his overly long discriptive style and the lack of action or suspense. I just wanted to get this ""night"" overwith. I now have something to base his other works on and in comparing this book to the ""Watchers"" is like night and day. Not recommended as a first read of his works."
3,A Disappointment,"All these terrible things happen to the main character Christopher Snow, (for instance, his father dies at the very beginning of the novel) and you just don't care. His dog has more personality. The only riveting part of the book is when the police chief threatens to shoot the dog. A previous book, Intensity was much better because you cared so much about the main character, and wanted her to survive."
3,First Person Narrative Never Works,"I am a big Dean Koontz but Fear Nothing was a disappointment. The lead character (Chris Snow) has some real potential and will hopefully be brought back in a better future novel. The first person narrative can be very difficult to write as well as read and Dean Koontz could not pull this one off. I could not feel the passion or intensity that Snow was supposed to be feeling. The climatic ending was anything but climatic as you only saw through Snow's eyes and his thoughts kept getting in the way of the action. Lastly, I felt that the ""surfer"" dialogue was too phoney and contrieved and definitely not to be believed. Bring Snow and his friends back but Koontz needs to return to the style of writing he does so well."
3,Not Believable enough,Okay I admit this was my first Koontz read and I was not that impress. The premise sounds interesting enough but the resolution was not believable at all. It's just not genetically possible. And another thing I didn't like was that Sasha girl. It's not a horrible book but if you're looking to be amazed this ain't it.
5,Very Entertaining,"This was the first book I read by Koontz and I am hooked. Very good story that had me hooked from page 1. I loved all the characters. This book was one that I couldn't wait to get back to when I had time to read. I have now read a few other Dean Koontz books (The Face & Sole Survivor) and Fear Nothing is my favorite so far. I am ready to read the sequel to this one ""Seize the Night"""
2,"Good Beginning, Too Wordy","This is the 1st Koontz book I read. I enjoyed the beginning of this book and the main character's youthful exploits were interesting. Then, it seemed to drag after that. I found myself skipping all the overly descriptive parts and just searching out the dialog. It is weird that the next Koontz book I read (The Watchers) would deal with pretty much the same subject matter. What are the odds?"
4,Exciting and interesting plot. Held my attention to the end,"The book started a little slow, but once it got going, the travels of Chris Snow, in the two nights the book takes place, held my attention completely. In places Koontz got a little over discriptive, but generally the book read well and was fun. I would recommend the book for anyone who likes some sci-fi type plots and who likes to see the good guy win in the end; at least the end of this book anyway."
2,"to fluffy for me, try Phantoms instead","When I first picked up this book, I made the unfortunate mistake of reading the quote on the front cover that said ""Fear Nothing will make you fear almost everything."" I assumed('nother mistake) that this book would be a somewhat intense or dark journey into a fantasy world rich with horrifying creatures and mind bending enigmas. What I found inside was,in my opinion of course, a fluffy childrens tale about a man and his dog. Sure there were mysteries to be solved, but I began wondering if Koontz had read to many ""Encyclopedia Brown"" books as a kid. If you want to read a better attempt at dark and intense, try ""Phantoms"" also by Koontz. He has the right idea in that one."
2,How long can one night be?,"I was very disappointed by this book. I have enjoyed Koonz in the past, and look forward to enjoying him again, but this was not one of those books. My biggest problem centers around just how long one night can be! If I were to do all of the things Snow does in this book in one night, I would have about 2 minutes for each thing. Snow apparently had approximately 36 hours in one night! How unrealistic! It was kind of like watching Die Hard 2--the one set in the airport. No matter how good the movie(it wasn't very good), there was just no way Bruce Willis could be in all those places in such rapid succession. The same goes with this book. It does help a little to know that this book is part of a trilogy. That does explain the ending. I will probably read the next one just to find out what happens to Orson."
3,"This book was better when it was called ""Midnight""","Having read over half of Koontz's novels that are still in print, this book was disappointing. The book contains too many elements from past (and better) novels, such as Midnight and Watchers. With regards to such a prolific writer like Koontz, I could accept some similarities, but it seems that this book was no novel on it's own accord, merely a piece of a trilogy. The novel also held only a limited amount of suspense. Although the reader is kept guessing as to what is going on, there is never any heart-pounding situations or thrills. The only reason that this receives a 6 is due to the creative character of Snow and Koontz's superior writing style and language."
3,"""Fear Nothing"" falls fearfully short.","Being a Dean Koontz fan, I very much looked forward to this latest book. As with so many others he has written, the pace was swift and the timeframe of the story is very short (24 hours). Those are the about the best things in this latest Koontz offering. The ending is very anti-climactic, the cast of characters is not one in which you come to invest much care about, and the premise, though somewhat interesting, doesn't deliver the punch I am used to with Koontz. If you must get it, at least wait until paperback!"
2,A Disapointment.,"I've been a fan of Koontz's earlier books and had stopped reading his most recent ones, which were not close to the suspense and character development as his earlier ones. I was quite disappointed with ""Fear Nothing"", especially after hearing good reviews of it. I think that the pretense of the story was promising, but most of the book was spent in Mr. Snow's mind, trapped among endless questions and thoughts. The plot dragged on and on and by the time you got to the middle of the book, you were yearning for some kind of knowledge. I wished Mr. Koontz spent more time and detail about the actual experiments and about ""becoming"", instead of beach lingo, and empty characters."
1,"It was too complex &made you wonder ""why is he doing this?!""","The book was extended and had alot of uneccesary details I beleive. In the book Christopher Snow did alot of things that I beleive were dumb or he really shouldn't have done if he had any right mind.The book in a whole was good at the beginning ,dragged through the middle, and had a pretty pointless end. I had to do a book report on it and realized how outlandish this book really was when summarized."
1,So boring I could barely finish..,"I read Koontz a lot as a teenager and really loved his stuff, but this book was so boring and so unlikely that I had to force myself to finish it. There was absolutely nothing to fear in this book because it was just plain stupid."
1,"Painful to try to read, couldn't finish it.","I tried, I really tried. By the time I was half way through this needlessly wordy book I was scanning, seeking the plot through the murk of blather. When I got the basics, with 60 pages to go, I ended the pain. Have no idea how he ended it and don't care to find out."
1,Ear Poison,"RE: UNABRIDGED AUDIO TAPE. I read Koontz's SEIZE THE NIGHT first, not realizing it was a sequel and rathered enjoyed it as a guilty pleasure. Now I find in the tape version of FEAR that there's no place to hide from the narrator-hero's tedious mood-setting, mind-numbing overdescription and maddening reluctance to get to the point of any scene. This apparently passes for suspense-building. I realize now that as a reader I skimmed over all this nonsense in SEIZE, somewhat masking the failure of the book's editors. But no-can-do with the unabridged tape version - one must sit there and take it. Either that or fast forward and risk missing the fleeting pay-off moments. Yes, I understand that thoughtful introspection and eloquent description can enhance great literature. Here it doesn't and this isn't."
1,Dean is on his way down,"This worst book that Dean has written, I have all of his books and enjoyed most of them. His last three books don't hold my interest the way his earlier ones did. I'm not sure if I will read any more of his books or not."
2,NOTHING TO FEAR,"I've given this book a rating of 4, and that's because I'm a fan of Dean Koontz books. Lately he hasn't been writing compelling tales. The story is very long in telling. Once you realize who the bad guys are, you really don't care to finish the story (I did)."
1,"Dear Dean: Make this a solo, not a trilogy.","I really usually like Dean's novels, but Fear Nothing really stretched my capacity to suspend belief past the breaking point. If I were even close to Chris in affliction or intellectual capacity (a New York Times best seller book), long before p. 225 (on the boat with Roosevelt), I and everyone else we all know would have grabbed a few people by the throats and said: ""What the hell is going on?"" Chris is disengenuous; Bobby is a surf-dork without a brain; the dog has some potential, but I'm putting this puppy down now and starting the new Grisham novel. Get a grip, Dean."
4,Another great book from this west coast author!,Fear Nothing will keep you intigued till the very last page! The possibilities of these events happening without an entire city knowing is fascinating and believable. This is the second Dean Koontz book I have read and I find his choice of vocabulary refreshing.
3,"good, but could be better","This is a nice book, easy to read, some chapters are better than others, especialley when the suspense is built (Koontz is at his best in those scenes), but all in all, his other books are much better. Some of the ideas here appeared an his other books already, plus the plot is confusing and the ending is somewhat vague."
5,Best characters of any DK book!,"I had read Koontz before (Demon Seed, Whispers) but was only slightly impressed. The characters in this book were as realistic as any I've ever read. The book is more Sci-fi than horror. It is spooky first turning to action. I've already read the sequel ""Sieze the Night"", and I hope for more."
3,way way too wordy! One fact shouldn't take 10 pages!,Difficult to get through this book. He strays away from the subject in every chapter. His strays take up to 10 pages at a time.
1,ZZZZZZZZZ,"I've read many of Mr. Koontz's previous books and this one is a real letdown. Way too slow and really never goes anywhere. Especially frustrating is to find out that this is nothing more than a prelude to the next installment. I really don't care what happens to these so-called ""real"" characters. The author at the end of the book says he plans to spend ""years"" with these people. That's ok because it will give me a chance to read some other authors until Mr. Koontz gets them out of his system."
2,WELL BELOW QUALITY OF KOONTZ'S PAST WORKS!!!,"An avid reader of Koontz, this is the first time I have ever been disappointed. I normally read his novels in 2 to 10 days, but this one took about five weeks!! It seemed to promise something, teasing you with suspense, then nothing happened, nothing happened at all. I almost gave it three stars but felt that would be overly generous which Koontz was not with this book. Maybe the sequel will make up for it, will let you know when I get the guts to read it."
2,Yawn...,"I read the book Icebound and loved it, but this book is no comparison. You find yourself saying ""Get it over! Solve the mystery already!"" If you are an avid Koontz reader you will be disappointed."
1,TRASH--INSULTING,"I have been reading Koontz for at least 10 years. This novel is by far the worst he has written. Dean--stay away from the first person--It gets in the way of the action. Also that surfer language--plastic and cheap. I forced myself to finish this awful book because I didn't want to feel like I wasted my money. Stay away from this title. If you like Koontz, read his last good book, ""Intensity"". There's a good read."
4,Freaky.,"A bit more into the conspiracy theory than I would have liked, but Dean Koontz hooks you and holds on fast to the end."
2,Not one of his best,"This book didn't have much point to it. I had to force myself to finish it. Although I love most of Dean Koontz books, this one just wasn't a good book. It had interesting parts but most were pointless. If you have never read Dean Konntz, I highly suggest you don't start with this one."
2,Is my book missing some pages?,"I love Dean Koontz and his earlier books, they have always been fantastic, I couldn't wait for this book to come out. I read the book, and was so disappointed in the ending...I thought the content was good, but the ending was so abrupt, I thought I was missing a chapter or two. It could've been better, and I hope Koontz gets back his old fire, and stops trying to be so..whatever he's trying to be!"
4,Fear Nothing: A Novel (Moonlight Bay),"I always like Christopher Snow and enjoy seeing what he is up to now. However, I am not sure of this book. In 2001 I read ""Fear Nothing"". However, when I read ""Fear Nothing: A Novel (Midnight Bay)"" it felt like a new book. Was it? Are there going to be more new Christopher Snow stories. I have been wondering what happened to him."
5,One of the best books I have every ready,"This was so scary, because it makes you think it could happen. You never know what the the army is realy doing. That science have come so far that something like that could realy happen."
3,Definately Not Koontz Best,"I've read quite a few Koontz novels and this is probably my least favorite. I loved the characters in this book - but the plot was too predictable and bland for me. I never did catch the main reason the experiments were going on. Probably because I slept through it. I tried reading ""Seize The Night"" but didn't make it passed the first chapter. It was the first Koontz novel I could put down. Guess there has to be a first time for everything."
2,"Fear Nothing, except maybe being bored out of you gourd!","I read the 1st few pages and skimmed the book while at the book stand. I liked the author's writing style and the story line seemed to offer an engrossing read. Unfortunately, when I read on and found that the book's basic theme is ""science gone wrong"" and ""government research project out of control"", I was really disappointed. There is no real substance or suspense, and I found myself leafing through the last half just to get to the end and get it over with. Borrring !"
2,NOT ONE OF HIS BEST!,"Fear Nothing is the first Dean Koontz novel I've read that has left me feeling a little disappointed. As I read the book, I kept waiting for it to draw me in but that really didn't happen 'till the very end."
3,Just good enough to finish,"This thriller seems to meet the minimum requirements for most people to finish it. Overall, a rehash of ""Watchers."" Some good suspense scenes but the book was wordy and the story just felt tired. Protagonist's handicap made for a new character but in this case it seemed very contrived. A new plot, fresher ideas, and fewer smart dogs next time, Mr. Koontz."
4,When will the next book in the trilogy be on the shelves?,Loved Chris Snow and all the excitement and suspense in his life. I'm dying for the second book in the series to come out. Does anyone know when it will appear?
2,WORST ENDING SINCE DRAGON TEARS,"Okay, I really like Koontz and read all his books. But this time he has gone to far. We not find out nothing about what is going on in Moonlight Bay (Can you say...Midnight)until the last 10 pages. The story itself is stupid and a rehash of 10 Koontz novels. Koontz needs to try and write....ORIGINAl stories. I was soooo disapointed and I yearn for the man who brought us In The House of Thunder... :("
4,Engrossing,"Don't listen to the worst of the worst critics Dean!It was excellent.Only those with little knowledge and no intellect at all could bad-mouth your writing..I for one look forward{as always}to the next Koonz book..whether it be the sequel to Fear Nothing,or another masterpiece by the Master of Suspense..."
1,Fear Nothing : A recipe for disaster.,"Take one scoop ""Watchers"" (genetically engineered superdog). Mix in two quarts of ""Midnight"" (good ol' townspeople changing into weirdos with the by-now-familiar sexual aberrations). Add a dash of ""Intensity"" (animals out to get hero). Stir in generous quantities of flowery adjectives, fruity adverbs, 'cool' surfer slang and melt-in-your-mouth metaphors. Bake for one night in lukewarm oven. Serves the steadily decreasing population of Dean Koontz fans."
2,Too much imagery and too many side-journeys,"Vivid imagery and philosophical side-journeys can be good, but when overused, can dramatically slow down suspense. Sadly, this book is laden with things that slow the book almost to a crawl. I kept wanting to skip over long sections--several pages at a time--just to get back to the real action. I am writing a novel myself, and this book taught me what NOT to do. Also, I've decided that plots like this one are a bit too evil for my taste; I prefer plots with wholesome messages."
3,More originality please!,"Unfortunately, in this book Koontz is just rearranging his own familiar plots, settings and characters, resulting in a tiresome pastiche of his earlier works. SPOILER ALERT. Viz., biologically engineered animals, both good and bad (Watchers), a small coastal California town held in secret terror (Midnight) and part of a vast conspiracy (House of Thunder), genetically-whacked-out humans (Shadowfires; Midnight; The Bad Place). Been there, done that. Koontz needs to stop using the ""Cut and Paste"" function on his computer so much."
4,Fear Nothing,"This was my first Koontz book and it wont be my last. The action starts right away after Snow's father dies and he walks in on his body being taken. Everything snowballs from there as Snow finds one revealing fact after another. The book takes place over the span of two nights and the day inbetween is mentioned briefely before the action heats up again with the final showdown with the monkeys from hell. This is the first of three books in the Moonlight bay series and we get a good intro to the four main charachters here.Orson, the extraordinarially smart and humourous dog, Sasha the deejay, Bobby the surfer dude, and of course Chris Snow, the nighstalking self proclaimed ""elephant man"".This has the potential to be a great trilogy and I look forward to the next book."
2,Every situation is contrived,"While I loved INTENSITY, the premise of this one did not ring very true. I didn't feel like even Koontz felt much for his main character. The character's disorder felt like it was contrived so that Koontz could keep the action after dark. Every ""twist"" in the plot felt manipulated, and the dialogue (especially between Snow and his surfer friend) was horrible.Read INTENSITY. Then move on to other authors."
4,Fear Nothing (except the suspenseful parts),"This book is very exciting and has a deep mysterious plot with a lot of interesting developments in the prime of the story, but it leaves one with a sense of emptiness and questions when one is finished, leaving one to read the sequel ""Seize The Night"". Even though the ending may not be the best, the story is still pretty entertaining, with many interesting and suspenseful events that will put you on the edge of your seat (if you read in a seat), and keep you reading for hours.I enjoyed this book quite a bit, however I do recommend another Dean Koontz book, ""Tick Tock,"" over this book.-Reveiw by Dakota S."
3,Good Beginning But....,"something went wrong, and I'm not quite sure what, either. My favorite part of the book was where Chris was being chased through the woods after leaving the mortuary. I thought, this is gonna be great. I kept waiting for it to get that great again, and it didn't, and eventually I started skipping pages, which may be why I still have this nagging question at the end: WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST CREMATE HIS DAD? I still don't know.This was my very first Koontz book, and I was pleased enough that I will probably read another. But I wasn't blown away either. I think he has a great deal of talent, but needs to spend more time polishing his work."
2,fear this book!,"By far, the worst Koontz book I've ever read. I did force my way through it but it was difficult. I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone. Maybe ""Lightning"" by Koontz is a better choice."
2,What a Disappointment!,"Sorry Dean, but this book was just not up to your usually great works. I've been a fan a very long time, have read all your books, but this one just didn't cut it, the last 3rd of the book was when the story got going. Don't think I'll bother with the 2nd part. ""INTENSITY"" was GREAT so I know you've got what it takes, please try again."
4,Dark mystery that keeps you reading.,"The premise is a bit thin, but the story moves swiftly and kept me on the edge."
3,Disappointing,"Most of Koontz's books I would read again. This is not one of them. There were a few scenes where Snow is being stalked by people and/or creatures that had my heart pounding. However, some of the narrative and conversations with the surfer friend were a bit contrived and rambling, and I found myself skipping ahead."
5,One of his most lovable characters,"Christopher Snow is one of Koontz's most lovable & memorable characters. And that's saying alot because Koontz has written many novels & all with great characters!!Imagine living with XP, not being able to go into the sunlight. That in itself is a scary thought, leaving you feeling trapped. No imagine someone is trying to kill you.This is one of Koontz's best books. Go out & get it!"
5,An interesting read!,"Christopher Snow, faced with many problems such as only being able to ""live"" during the night. During the day, because of his illness, he has to be holed up in shadows and so forth. The plot thickens with his father's death, then his body being stolen, and Snow not being ""allowed"" any time to grieve... To find out the truth, he has to run from shadow to shadow (also having to avoid street light), follow wicked bad guys to who knows where and in the end stumble upon a mystery/problem greater than his father's bodysnatching... A great read, also very interesting, passes time quickly too! I found myself with the ""I've got to finish this chapter... well maybe one more... well..."", etc."
3,Koontz Bites Off More Than He Can Chew (spoiler),"Briefly, Koontz has done his usual frustrating thing: written a book full of likeable characters and highlighted by some remarkable scenes, but then shot himself in the foot by not knowing when to stop.A sequel to ""Seize the Night,"" ""Fear Nothing"" takes place in the same moonlit town. Orson the (almost) talking dog and his pigmentally-challenged owner hit the night streets to save the town. Some genuine suspense follows, but Koontz digs himself in too deep with too many plots -- an entire extended (and dull) scene involving an underground time-travel room should have been cut completely. As for the future of the town... and the series... what fun is it when we already know it is ""too late?"""
1,The worst koontz book of all time,"I love deans books, but this one is so boring, I really found it hard to finish it and it was not memorable"
3,"Classic Koontz, this is NOT!","As a fan of many of Koontz's books, I found this one to be ultimately disappointing. The descriptions seemed to be filler and the story died about 2/3 of the way through. I found it hard to finish, but I will buy the next in the hopes of a resolution to all that transpired in this one. Dean, stick with what you do best. Readers,do yourself a favor and read Watchers again. Skip this tired,rehashed genetic bore."
4,Great Book,"This is an awesome book. I really enjoyed it and the book easy to read and understand. This is truly a page turner and you won't be disappointed by reading this book. The second book about Snow, Seize the Night, is also a must read."
1,Dean Koontz has gotten on the wrong track.,"I love Dean Koontz novels and have read all of the ones I can find. But this one just pissed me off. How can you go back to a town that was haunted by weird super race people that became their computers, a super race, and start a whole new novel. Then this Sieze the Night crap is just making me more angry, because I hate series, I promise I cursed King when he did his Green Mile bull. If Koontz wants to succeed he should write some more of those earlier types of novels, like Twilight Eyes, Strangers, Night Chills, and The Funhouse. Those are his best novels and if he can regain the urge to write more of these, he will become the hottest thing since Brittney Spears. Hey I know I am only fourteen, but I just want to read some more good stuff."
2,Where's the fear??,"I read Dean Koontz to be frightened silly, which he's accomplished in the past pretty regularly. This book was a laugh -- it lacks a truly scary plot, action, and a satisfying closure. If it is just an installment in a series that will all revolve around this same evil, I think he's just writing books to make a buck and that I'll pass on the remaining books in the series. Too bad -- I've always enjoyed his work before."
1,I FEARED THAT IT WOULD NEVER END OR GET TO THE POINT,"I have been a Dean Koontz fan for many years, looking forward to the next book. Fear Nothing is my 10th Dean Koontz book so I know how great his writing can be. Unfortunately, in this book, there is no point to the story or the characters. I have no problems with poetic license, understanding the psyche of the characters, or an in depth story, but 300 pages of scenery is excessive. The entire book could have been summed up better as a short story. If you are looking for prime Koontz, read Mr. Murder or Whispers both of which still make me shiver long after I put the books down."
4,I can't wait to read the continuation,This is one of Koontz's best books. I couldn't put it down. I never got bored with the flow of the book or the story. I am looking forward to reading the continuation in Sieze the Night
1,Fear nothing is right. There's nothing to fear here,"I got this book as a Christmas present. I must say that this book is one of the absolute worst I have ever read. ""Fear Nothing"" is right - I wasn't even creeped out at all. I kept reading to see how bad the book could get, and I was not disappointed. I'm not even sure that this book qualifies as a horror novel. The only thing that can be said for it is that Mr Koontz (or his ham-fisted ghost-writers) knows how to tell a story in first person. If only the story was interesting..."
1,What happened!!!!!,"Let me first point out that four of my top ten favourite books of all time are written by Dean Koontz. I literally devour his books and they are usually satisfying in a way or another. When I first heard he was working in a trilogy I could not wait to buy my copy of the first volume. But, What a mayor dissapointment!. Difficult to explain , the idea is good and the characters original but nothing in this book is appealing. And that annoying surfing lingo!. This smells to contract obligations. So I will skip the next two and wait for the real Koontz to come back."
2,One of my least favorite books by my most favorite author,I was actually disappointed with this book. I wasn't at all drawn to the characters or hooked into the storyline as I am with so many of his books. I will probably read the sequel despite my less than positive review.
3,Mildly enjoyable,Haven't been a Koontz reader since his earliest books. Someone loaned me this and the sequel. I wouldn't really call it horror. More akin to Sci-Fi. The dog and the cat are more interesting than the human characters.
5,It kept my pulse pounding,"I have slowly become a fan of Dean Koontz and after reading this, well, I am addicted. The suspense from page to page kept me up all night. The characters were wonderfully written and some areas of the book were hilarious. All in all, I loved this book!"
4,"Not 'The Stand', but worth a read.","This was about the fifth Koontz novel that I read since running out of Stephen King books, and I have to say that it's not bad for an end-of-the-world-is-coming kind of affair. Intelligent dogs and cats, creepy menacing people, and a secret that could change the face life on the planet combine to form, with Koontz's dry humor, a very compelling tale that made me want to read it in one sitting. I didn't, of course, but it didn't take long. It's the creepy journey of a man who's just lost his second parent and goes looking for answers and finds instead... Well, I'll let you find out for yourself. I loved this book so much that I was praying for a sequel when I finished it. Fortunately, 'Seize the Night' just came out in paper, so if you like this one, you'll want that one. (Review coming soon)"
2,Definitely not one of his best works,"The story starts slow, too much descriptive language, and ends without satiating my appetite. It really doesn't explain anything and the ending is quite predictable. Would not recommend. Instead, read ""Midnight"" which is one of his best novels yet."
1,great disappointment,"I've read a number of Koontz books and have enjoyed them a great deal, but Fear Nothing is probably the worst book that I've tried to read in many, many years.The storyline would have been good, but the story telling made it impossible for me to read and enjoy. I found myself skimming page after page, trying to get to the good parts. The good parts were few and far between, unfortunately.The book has far too much flowery, needless, in-depth descriptions of the most mundane things that did nothing to make the story anything but a chore for me to read.I'd intended to buy the sequel, but I am afraid to waste the money on it."
1,Too wordy,"I have read many of Koontz's books and found this one to be extremely boring. He could have cut it in half and come to the point sooner. His descriptions were more than I wanted or needed to know in order to tell the story. Go back to writing short stories and forget the novels. Listening to the audio version, I was unable to skim through the descriptions and had to sit through too much muck to get to the point."
3,Fear Nothing was an okay book,"Fear Nothing was a good book that had a lot of potential, but did not deliver. I am a big Koontz fan and have read most of his books, and I thought that this book does not measure up to his usual books. I could hardly put the book down until I reached the end. In the end it seemed to me that Koontz tried to end the book too fast. The book was good, but not near as good as most of his books. I would recommend many other of his books before this one."
3,Not one of his best,"If you have read ""Watchers"" you will find many similarities in the plot and characters in this book. ""Watchers"" was better by far. I'm beginning to feel that some of my favorite horror writers (Stephen King especially) are running out of fresh ideas and are capitalizing on things they've written in the past to sell more books. The beginning was too drawn out and I was more than half way through before the story line really became interesting. Hope Mr Koontz does better next time."
5,An exciting and thought-provoking masterpiece.,"Fort Wyvern:Moonlight Bay's top secret research facility. Deep into its labs lies the future. The townspeople are unsuspecting, living their normal lives. One such is Christopher Snow. By most peoples standards, he does not lead a normal life. He has a rare genetic disorder that he shares with few other Americans. He cannot tolerate exposure to the sun. His skin and eyes are very sensitive. Upon the death of his last remaining relative, his father, he discovers a worldwide conspiracy that originates in his Southern Californian town of Moonlight Bay. He finds two unimaginable facts... END"
1,The basic plot was good but very poorly developed,"The story line had good potential but was never developed. The reader finds himself wading through obscure philosophical discussions that smack of filler in between significant happenings in the life of Mr. Snow. If all of the filler were removed this would actually be a short story. Mr Koontz must have cranked this book out in record short time. While he may be laughing all the was to the bank, anyone who purchased this book was taken. It is one of the poorest books I have read in a long time and definitely not worth reading. If an unkown had sent this book to a publisher it would have been rejected. Mr. Koontz appears to have run out of gas. I will waste no more time on him."
5,A gripping book!,"Fear nothing was an excellent book, which I loved. It provided an insight into the world of Chris Snow and the problems he had to face having XP. I liked the fact that this book is very realistic in terms of genetic enginering,as believe it or not we are not that far away from modified animals/people! On that note all I can say is look out for the monkey troop the next time you're at Sainsbury's! I would strongly advise all of Koontz's fans and new readers alike to pick this book up. Get stuck in to the 'Master of Fear's' best yet."
5,Koontz's best yet!,"This was the fourth of Koontz's books that I have read, and was one of the most enjoyable. He combines a thrilling tale with an 'against the odds' plot. Unlike other writters in the thriller/horror genre, he concentrates on character development and not just the blood and manadotory 'blood fest'. This book would be #1 on my Christmas list!"
2,FEAR NOTHING,"WHILE THIS BOOK IS GOOD READING, IT IS MERELY THE FIRST PART OF WHAT OBVIOUSLY IS A LARGER BOOK THAT THE AUTHOR HAS HALVED IN ORDER TO SELL TWO BOOKS. THIS BOOK SIMPLY INTRODUCES THE READER TO THE CHARACTERS THAT EXIST IN THE SECOND BOOK,""SEIZE THE NIGHT"". MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO BYPASS ""FEAR NOTHING"" AND READ THE MORE DIFINITIVE ""SEIZE THE NIGHT"", UNLESS YOU HAVE EXTRA MONEY TO WASTE. ""SEIZE THE NIGHT"" IS A MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE AND SCARY BOOK."
1,Watchers Recycled (badly),"Well, I just finished ""Fear Nothing"" and I thought it was awful. Dean Koontz has written some excellent novels; Watchers, Lightning, Strangers. This was *not* one of them, merely a cheap knock off of some of his earlier work, spliced with howlingly bad surfer dialogue. The surfer dialogue is particularly annoying because it doesn't appear until nearly 150 pages into the book when Christopher Snow meets his surfer friend. After that meeting, bizarre surf metaphors and similes figure regularly into the main character's speech. Forget the lame ""genetic infection"" plot, what really scared me was the idea that surfer-speak might be contagious."
2,Too Poetic.,The story is a good one but in my opinion it is Koontz's worst title. Paragraph after paragraph of lengthly descriptions that beat around the bush. It makes me think that he was trying too hard to be poetic. The situations are described so different than his previous work that I wonder if he wrote this entire book on his own.
5,CyberPower AC Power Converter,"My wife and I are planning a road trip this summer and wanted a way to charge camera batteries, cell phones and operate a laptop computer. The reviews indicated the CyberPower AC Power Converter was a good unit to purchase. We purchased the device and have since run several road test, 2 of which it powered an IBM laptop(with GPS software)for 5-7 hours. It worked GREAT! It ran cool and kept the battery in the laptop at full charge for the duration of the trips. We are very happy with this purchase."
3,"Find for smaller items, will not power my laptop","Bought this one to use when traveling and my Targus inverter went to Michigan with my son. It looks the same, but isn't. My laptop, an HP 17"" is 19v, and this will not power it. It works for about 30 seconds then goes off. It will work for items with a lower power requirement, but not a larger laptop."
3,Smaller Better,"Works well on small items but had to keep the motor running to power the laptop. To be fair, this may be due to Fords Power Drain Monitor or may not."
2,broke down relatively quick,"I used it primarily for my handheld apple devices. Rarely for a laptop. The thing broke down quite soon after the purchase, and was relatively loud. I have another converter that i really like by Duracell - flat, black little thing with a turn on blue button. Really nice."
3,Very different vibe from the 1st movie,"It had been so long since I originally saw this movie, I wasn't sure I'd even seen it until viewing my recent DVD purchase from Amazon. This movie is all about mayhem and pandemonium caused by the Gremlins, much more rude and crude than I remembered. Lots of gross gags and innappropriate noises at every transition of the film.I had read so many reviewers stating this movie was better than the original, I decided to buy it, it was so cheap.Kind of embarassing to watch, very much so, actually. In a nutshell, writing a good story took a back seat to blowing up Gremlins in a microwave oven."
4,Funny movie,"Gremlin movies are never very scary, but they are funny. This movie is especially funny because the Gremlins take all these potions that change them. There is the smart one, the gargoyle, the spider, and the lightning bolt. Christopher Lee is in this movie as a crazy scientist. He is funny in that role. If you are looking to be scared, don't watch this movie. If you are looking for a funny movie, try this one out. Make sure to stick around for the ending in the bathroom. :)"
4,Fun Halloween movie,Doesn't have quite the mood or atmosphere of the first one but it is still a lot of fun and Gizmo's animimatronics are better than the first one.
3,Not as good as the first but still not that bad,"A lot of people hate Gremlins 2 but I always found it to be goofy and creative fun. It's not as original and good as the first eventhough some critics actually gave it better reviews than it. Possibly because they thought the first one was a little too dark for kids and this one is a lot more lighter even if it still does have violence. It's mostly just goofy violence though. It gets creative with it's type of Gremlins this time around too. Since their is a mad scientist played by Christopher Lee who's chemicals they get into. One turns into a half gremlin half spider, one turns electrical, one has a face with vegatables all over it and another gets wings and can now fly. That's all fun stuff but at least I think so since I know a lot of people that hate this movie."
5,Great DVD!!!! Better then the 1st IMO...and heres an EGG!!!!,"Gremlins 2. One of the very few seaqulls thats as good as the original... possibly better! depending on who you ask?I wont waste your time with a review, i'm sure theres plenty of them already... but i will say, if you own this DVD and feel a little disapointed that it is the movie release version, and not the telivision version? Then I have some good news for you, if you havent already discovered this?If you go to the special features, go down and highlight the GAG REEL, then press right -> and you should have highlighted the gremlins hands...push OK and you can veiw the scene from the video version where the gremlins take over the movie, and go into the John Wayne film ..ect, instead of the bit where Hulk Hogan tells the gremlins off! So those of you who where disapointed that wasnt included....well, it is! and thats how to find it!!!!"
3,.,"Distinctly inferior to the original Gremlins, but although immensely silly, this is generally an entertaining sequel. A good way to kill an evening if you liked the first Gremlins -- it's inspired and imaginative -- but ultimately it isn't exactly the gem the first one was."
4,Childhood memories,"I enjoy this creepy comdedy, but it doesn't live up to the first one. Gizmo looks different, the storyline cheesy, and the villains silly rather than the suspensefully scary Stripe from Gremlins. However, I loved watching the VHS of Gremlins II as a child, and I have been searching for this movie for years. For that, I'm happy I was able to find it on Amazon and complete my collection of Gremlins. I enjoy watching it, even if only for the nostalgia."
3,Ok!,This was not as good as the first one and had some ugly rotten dudes in this one .Not for five and under and maybe ten and under. Wish I had not bought this one. The first was the best.
1,sucked(...)!!!!!!!!!,I hated gremlin 2 it was just as cheasy as the first one!!!!!! I was hoping that gremlin2 would be beter than the first one but it was just as bad posibly worse!!!!!!!!! some people and reviews that I red said that it was scary and it was listed as a horror movie yah right!!!!!! it wasint even a little bit scary.
4,Good Sequel,"Not as good as the original, but still worth a watching. Better Special F/X and more monsters! The 90's pop culture references are even funnier now!"
4,An Old Favorite,"This was one of my favorite movies as a kid. I think it's a lot better than the first Gremlins actually. The special effects are improved quite a bit at the very least. It also has a much more lighthearted tone than the first film.What I like about this film is it's like a violent family film. It's pretty unique. Monsters killing tons of people, and then getting melted into goo at the end. Sounds pretty violent. Even looks pretty violent. Still, it has a family film feel to it. The gremlins do a lot of cheesy comic routines, appropriate for every member of the family.I can't see how the good guys were able to play these role with a straight face, because the gremlins are goofy as heck. I like the gremlins. Gizmo is all right too.If you have kids around the age of 12, rent this for them and see what they think of it."
4,Another classic,Although this film may not be as good as the first one it is still a childhood favorite of mine. It is nice to see the original actors return after 6 years and the humor and horror mix is perfect. The gremlins may not be CG but the effects hold up pretty well. If you liked the first one than I recommend this one as well.
4,Funny Stuff,"They are back. Those ideous creatures this time with more spunk. As a science experiment goes wrong alot more gremlins with many more powers and abilities. You will love it more than the first,."
5,Gremlins 2,Awesome movie. Part of the few sequels out there that are better than the original. Definitely recommend it.
3,Pretty cute,The kids will enjoy it. I liked the first one better and actually so did my son. He said there wasn't enough of Gizmo in this one.
3,"Not as good as the first Gremlins film, but worth the watch","Gremlins 2 is a goofy film that has none of the horror element of the first Gremlins movie. It is a series of gags, with only a bare sliver of plot to hold them all together. This movie is very funny, although definately inferior to the first. The special effects are cheesier, and there are ""plot holes"" in what little plot the film has...but this movie is definately worth seeing if you liked the first film. The worst part of this movie is, in my opinion, Mohawk (the black Mogwai and the Spider Gremlin). He is SUCH a Stripe wannabe. He tries to be impressive and evil as Stripe is, but he fails utterly."
2,Gremlins 2? Really?,"I was so excited to discover that there was a sequel to the classic Gremlins movie. I was disappointed in this movie, however. Stick with the original. Dont waste your money or time with this follow up."
1,Cheap DVD case! Looks like a copy!,I wonder if every disc sent out looks like it was packaged in somebodies basement with photocopied paper and dollar store DVD case? I hate when people give reviews of the movie without buying it from here!
2,Those aweful little creatures,"How and why did this movie ever get made? It was a ridiculous follow up to the destruction of Kingston Falls instead taking place in the Big Apple inside a skyscraper rather than a small town.Billy Peltzer and his girlfriend have moved from their small town to New York, and are working at the same company within a skyscraper. Somehow Gizmo has returned to them, having escaped the clutches of the mad scientist lab in the basement of their same workplace. The story is exactly like the one before, except that the art direction team had a few more liberties and went further with the new cute mogwai, and even greater creativity with the monsterous gremlins. The plot was more overtly campy than the first one, without the slightest hit of a horror movie and just a bunch of screwball comedy antics. Gizmo is still cute, and I still want to squeeze him, but don't waste your time."
3,Deceptive Paint,"I purchased this sword stand because there was no mention of any symbols painted on it like most of the others did. If you want a plain, black stand, seek one elsewhere. Very disappointed that it was not plain, though all the descriptions and picture did not show it. Must paint over it.Otherwise, it works as intended."
2,Cheap,"This item shipped fast, which is nice. However, the pieces didn't fit together. I had to cut the notches larger to even use it, and then repaint it black."
3,"Meh, poor",Hard to put together and had cheap wood as well. Would recommend paying for a better quality one if your serious about swords.
5,This Is Very Nice,"This is a very nice looking stand, and though you can't see it in the image they have here, there in an oriental painting on the front. It's pretty with my sameri sword display.I would buy from this company again."
4,la salsa vive,"The entire CD is super fabulous! This is one of the CD's I use for exercising, it is very energizing!"
5,The clearest explanation behind Christianity,"I highly, highly recommend this book. The story is a parable of the main message of Christianity (the setting is probably during or around the Depression era), and the illustrations are breathtaking. My children are always visibly moved when we read this book together. You will want to read this book to your children over and over again."
2,Too much.....,"This book is too much, and I mean that quite literally. It's too long, too heavy and the style of hypnosis it teaches has been around too long. Slow old fashioned and labourious.I brought this to compare with my favourite book on stage hypnosis by Jonathan Chase, ' Deeper and Deeper ' available from his site or amazon.co.uk It doesn't compare. McGills tombe reads like a clinical diatribe with no humour or pazazz. And for me if stage hypnosis doesn't have that then it has nothing.Much of this book is directly 'borrowed' from the works of Coue, Braid and Eisdale and has little or nothing entertaining in it. The routines are simply banal or unoriginal and much of the history of the art is inacurate at best.I've no doubt that McGill was a wonderful person but his book should pass on as well. Overpriced and over written.Bill"
1,Outdate And Full of Impractical and Useless Information,"I'm sorry to say it but this is way over priced for what it is.Whats worst is it is more of a historical document than a worthwhiletraining aid.The contents are clearly outdated and things have moved on hugelyin the world of Stage Hypnosis in recent years.For far less money you can get a book which is just as big and moreimportantly is full of 100% Killer Dynamite content, you'd be wiserto buy this:The Encyclopedia of Hypnotherapy, Stage Hypnosis & Complete Mind Therapy"
4,a decent book on stage hypnosis,this is one of the best books on stage hypnosis that you can get it is very informative but is becoming outdated if you do buy this book you should also look at other training in hypnosis as well gerald kein and mark cunningham both have exelent vidio courses
3,"OK, but greatly over-rated.","Archaic techniques. OK if you only want to do stage work, but otherwise, read some Milton Erickson."
5,Excellant Book,"You want to learn stage hypnosis from a master? Buy Ormand's book. I have all Ormand's book and had the opportunity to study with Ormand. A well written book filled with a lifetime of experience! A must for any serious student of hypnotism. Although I have been a professional stage hypnotist for over 15 years, I still refer people to Ormands gem filled book! Spencer- SleepNow.com Productions- How to Hypnotize Anyone, Anytime"
2,Confusing,I bought this book thinking it would be an easy in to the world of fun hypnotism. Not really. It's kind of hokey. I couldn't get through the first twenty or so pages. I will try again though (when I've got time).
3,Not Impressed,"While they are fairly affordable, the quality is less than impressive. They are relatively scratchy. I like the ones that I purchase at Wal-Mart better. I do like the fact that the strap is made out of loofa material as opposed to string though. But I will not be purchasing these again."
3,Waiting,Still back ordered...so we will see. Good lord...it is a scrubby for the shower and I don't have it yet.
2,Not what I expected,"Main bag is small. Magnets are weak. Build quality is nice. Less than what I expected for the price. Looks big, it is not. A sucky bag."
5,Ex-Library books - Left Behind: Tribulation Force,"It is nice that these books used to be library books, they have extra reinforced cover and binding. These are an ideal purchase. Great seller!"
5,Turn Back the Hands of Time!!!,"If you are as I, a child of the 50's, you won't get past the first cut, ""May I Sing to You"", before you're saying to yourself, ""I'm a kid, again!"". Everything about this anthology of 45 ballads is true to the original; from Hugo Winterhalter's production and orchestration to the man himself. Especially valuable was the fairly lengthy bio-sketch which accompanies the two cd's. Taragon did a truly outstanding piece of work with this."
5,Awesome tapes and quick service:),"These tapes were a gift for my mother and she is absolutely crazy about them. She plays them on a daily basis. I'd recommend them to anyone who enjoys listening to Eddie Fisher, one of the best tenors ever:)"
4,very nice effort,Not as strong an album as i was expecting but some lovely tracks.Jill scott cover is the highlight for me.
5,The Independents Better Than Ever!!!,i Love this album!! The songs just stick in your head all day and night!!! one of my favorite records of all time.i loved the intro to never see you again but that song did lack.This band live will really blow you away!!!Amazing band
2,2001 pathfinder review,- took two weeks to receive in the mail.- about a 50% fit. small plastic tabs keeping this grille in place are not secure at all. i've been driving my truck with the grille in place for two weeks and it hasn't fallen out but i don't give it a chance of more than a few months before it falls out at some point.
5,"What Are You Waiting For? Buy This CD, and Spread the Word","Stan Ridgway is one of those ""special"" artists -- you know, the ones nobody's quite sure they've heard of, but people familiar with him just kind of wink, saying: I've been there.SR is film, he's music, he's literature, he's Johnny Cash and Rod Serling and Ennio Morricone and all sorts of other things all rolled into one. If Harry Dean Stanton wrote tunes, he'd be Stan Ridgway. If L.A. Confidential were a person, he'd be Stan Ridgway.Every album Stan's done is the best album he's ever done. They're addictive, they're good driving music, and some stuff, particularly on this CD and on the Drywall: Work the Dumb Oracle CD, will make you feel just a little uncomfortable to be living in this day and age.Underneath it all, Stan is a stunningly original talent. This is a fantastic CD.Okay? Buy it. Just buy it. If you don't like it, who knows? Maybe you're not living on the right planet (or maybe you are, and you just don't know it yet)."
2,Not what I expected,Probably my own fault. I was looking for something more like the Spirited Away soundtrack. This album is VERY experimental.
2,I'd heard it all before...,"While this book does make you wonder why the public tends to put popular stars on a pedestal, this particular book and it's poorly disguised resemblance to another R&B icon said absolutely nothing I did not already know. While it focuses on the relationship between the main character and Mr. Beemo, the publicized stories and gossip about this R&B singer makes this a book that could have been written by anyone who reads the latest gossip magazines and tabloids. I waited for that ""WOW"" moment, the moment that would blow me away, it never came. Ms. Dulaney is a promising writer, but I'd love to see some real fiction, based on imaginary characters rather than a biography of sorts, misrepresented as 'fiction'."
2,Used To Be The Best...,"The original Leatherman used to be the best thing around until they outdid themselves. I still own this original Leatherman (in any form they are better than the best Swiss Army Knife) but by contrast this version of the Leatherman is awkward and painful to use. If you really need a grip when the item is open the edges of the handle bite into the hand. The blades, as are all tool here, are inside, and nothing locks into place. I strongly recommend picking up almost any other Leatherman than this one, if you really need one you'll be glad you spent the extra money."
5,quality,"I consider this my first multitool. I had 3 gerbers and all 3 broke their pliers and hurt my hand when they did, they do not count. My brother who was on leave from the army left his PST with me and I use and abuse it daily. It does have faults but it has lasted so long that I don't even notice them anymore. This is a very high quality tool that sits in its pouch on my belt at work day after day while my co workers keep trying inferior multitools that never last long."
2,"Product is good, free gift offer is not true.","This product lived up to my expectations, but you should be warned that the maglite offer is not true. I ordered 5 of these for groomsmen at our wedding (about $150 purchase) and did not even receive a single maglite even though the minimum purchase was $25 and every knife we received repeated this offer. I wrote in about the error and never even received a reply email. Just a fair warning if you are buying this brand over another for the free gift."
5,Pocket Toolbox,"I'm on my 5th multi tool and my second Leatherman mini-tool. Because of its small size, I pack it everywhere I go -- at work they call me Fix-it Dave because it aids me in repairing almost any office equipment. When doing handyman stuff, the full size needle-nose pliers and the flat screw driver are great for electrical work. The needle-nose are sharp enough to dig splinters out of my hide. After years of use, I disfigured mine enough by melting the end and attempting to cut a hardened steel screw that it needs to be replaced. Hard to find, but worth the work. I almost ordered two to avoid the lag time in ordering. As long as Leatherman makes one, I'll own a mini-tool."
5,"Small, but very usefull!","Just lost my Leatherman ""Micra"", the one with the scissors. Saw this one and find it as nice if not better than the ""Micra"". I was using the small scissors for light occassional pruning in the yard and can still prune with the small wire cutters on the pliers, but I also now have a small and substantial pliers.."
4,River Monsters at it's best,"Purchased this to share with the volunteers working on the ""Amazon Journey: Vicious Fishes & Other Riches"" exhibit. Had 3 of the 5 programs on the Amazon, so was worth getting the full DVD. Very interesting & helpful information. A bit graphic in places, but not out of place."
4,"Simple,poignant and funny","A simple poignant story on the different reasons why people mourn or cry.This is not the best filipino film I've seen but it is definitely endearing and funny. It tackles a lot of issues and insights on modern filipino culture- the crossover of chinese traditions,economic migration,etc.Pastre's review is more of a personal attack on the actors (severely over-weight? Come on.) and the Filipino film industry rather than a critique of the story.Obviously, he or she is clueless how big A.O. Scott and Kevin Thomas are in the world of film reviews.Definitely, this film is worth watching.Believe me"
4,Good,"It's a good realistic story about how some single Filipinas live and the troubles they face: making a living alone, having low self-esteem, and dealing with married men who cheat on their wives. I liked Sharon's performance. She seemed very real and her character was not very glamorous at all, which I thought was courageous -- especially for a popular celebrity. Borrow it sometime, you might like it enough to own it."
5,Musica sagrada en tierras lejanas,"It was not until recent that I heard for the first time the music of Esteban Salas.I came across it by chance when I was looking for music from colonial Latin-America in amazon.com website. I listen to the samples that they had on the website,and I was very surprise with Don Esteban's music.I was very happy to know that here in the western hemisphere we also have composers as great as the ones in Europe.Don Esteban's music is very good and devotional also very simple.Don Esteban also shows how well he was able to work with his limited number of instruments and he does a great job at it too."
5,Love it,"Entrega rápida, embalaje excelente, precio muy bueno, gran calidad, mejores que los OEM, los recomendaria sin duda alguna y creo que los volveré a comprar!"
5,For my 2006 E150,Same as oem. Can't comment on price since I didn't shop around. Getting amazon boxes is like xmas every week.
2,Songs Differ greatly...,"I generally don't like this album. Some songs aren't that bad like their new single Drowning, and Beautiful is ok..... but I hate all the songs that have stupid lyrics like ""got so many tattoos...."", blah, blah blah.. and all that egotistical macho bs... just listen to the title track Darkhouse and you'll know what I mean. Also, they soo switched their vibe to try to sound more Linkin Park like - which everyone is doing... get one rap guy and one melodic singer, throw in a rock background... but it is just weak!! I know it's not on the album, but doesn't the song they did with Paul Oakenfold ""Starry-eyed surprise"" sound EXACTLY like ""Butterfly""??"
5,classic,"everyone wants to talk crap about cxt but this was by far thier best work. Seth give bret a ring ang get back together, I think you guys were just starting to sound great................."
1,found this garbage,"if i could id give this zero stars. i found this cd in a cd binder case i bought at a garage sale.not knowing what it was as i was driving i poped it into my cd player.i went through every track its was dribble on all of them.this cd should be used to torture people. i bet they would confess to murders after this.this album is full of a bunch of wanna be gangstas who cant play any of there intruments so they tune them down.i could probably teach an armless 3 year old to play this stuff.to conclude as i was done flippin through the cd, i fliped it out the window.thats the one good thing it did fly far and shatter upon impact"
3,crazy town what happen,they don't sound like in their debut album probably because ther is less rapping but they sound good after all .if you lke the first album buy this one y'all.this album is more for cxt fanatics.
1,YIIIIIIIKKKKEEEES!!!,Man this sounds horrible. The band seems to have digressed in their musical talent! It is no wonder why I had no idea the album was even out. POOOOOOOOORRRRRR MUSIC!
4,Fantastic Album!,"Wow is all I can say! They've really improved from the last album ""The Gift of Game"". I pre-ordered this album 2 months ago and I was a little sceptic about this new CD, is it really as good as the 1st one? The first CD had a huge smash-hit known as ""Butterfly"" and surprisingly, the 2nd single ""Revolving Door"" was almost as good as the 1st one.The rest of the 1st album was decent when I listened on it for the first time but after a while I thought it was just great!All I can say about this album is that it's simply awsome! I love when every song is good, even the two bonus tracks, track 23 and track 32 called ""One Fly Girl"" and ""Them Days"" are good too! 5 stars for me is a truly masterpiece album, Darkhorse isen't really up there but how many (CD's) is?!Summary: Go buy it immediately! :)"
3,sweet,"its f'in sweet,(but dont buy it burn it)or buy it if you want i could care less. it has some great songs on it like 'skulls and stars' and 'drowning' also 'decorated',the rest are ok"
1,Terrible,"The first album ""Gift of Game"" was much better in my opinion. The first album was real rap/metal and they came out with some aggressive rap lines backed by some strong distortion and catchy hooks.I was looking forward to this album DarkHorse coming out... when I bought it I was so dissapointed. Their style changed into some teeny-bopping bubblegum pop. They really put their skirts on for this one. The once rough edged hard lined lyrics and guitar chops from the earlier album were replaced by them trying to sing, harmonize and get in touch with their feminine side.Huge disappoinment. If you're going to buy one of their albums, choose Gift of Game... hopefully they won't repeat this."
3,CXT-LET DOWN,"CXT FIRST REALISE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE CDS OF ALL TIME BUT SINCE THA GIFT OF GAME..THEY SEEM 2 HAVE LOST THA GIFT THA NEW ALBUM SUCKED IT WAS SIMPLE LYRICS....AVERAGE GUTARIS.....AVERAGE SONGS CRAZY TOWN LOST THERE TUFF DARK LYRICS AND SLIGHTLY INDUSTRIAL FEEL AND PURE POWER IS GONE A PERFECT BAND THAT LOST ITS UNECIC SOUND. THA STAND OUT TRACKS ARE....BATTLECRY,TAKE IT 2 THA BRIDGE,CHANGE...BUT IF I KNOW CRAZY TOWN THEYLL BE BACK WITH SUM HUGE NEXT TIME AROUND IM WAITING ANYTHING WILL BE BETTER THAN THAT MESS....CXT 4 EVER (STILL GOT HOPE SHIFTY,EPIC BETTA GET THERE HEDS UP)"
2,nothing like the debut,"Crazytowns 2nd album is realy nothin like the gift of game. I basically went to sleep on tracks like change,beutiful,sorry,and skulls and stars. Decorated,hurt so bad,drowning,and waste of time are not that bad and battle cry and Take it to the bridge are cool metal rap songs. But basically this is not a rap/rock albums theres too many ballads."
2,"Oh, man...","Well, I loved Gift of Game. I really did. It was edgy, crazy, and out-there. It was my first taste of a serious combination of Hip-hop and Metal.But this?This is as if they've taken Gift of Game and watered it down. It's disappointing. The rappy songs aren't rappy enough. The angry songs aren't angry enough. The sexual songs aren't sexual enough. Basically, it's a big let-down. Crazytown are dead, people. Long live crazytown.BONUS POINT - On the second hidden track, wait till Epic says the words ""Bling Bling!"" It's the funniest thing I'm heard in a long, long time."
2,much more mature but not much better,"they actually dont rap on this cd (to an extent that is), but the rhythms they present have been used so many times before and all the songs sound the same.sorry crazy town, your days are up."
5,Wonderful,Garson does a great job showing off Tracy and Hepburn in this delightful book. You get to take a look inside Kate's life from a good friend of hers. Garson passed away in March of this year and he left many wonderful things behind. This book just being one. He also wrote several of the screenplays that Tracy and Hepburn stared in. This book is a must for all.
3,Crash of the Moons (1954),"Rocky Jones, space ranger, is the commanding officer of the United World's spacecraft. Rocky must somehow prevent the collision of two populated planets. Flanked by his bumbling sidekick Winky, the brillant professor Newton, and the lovely Veda, its up to Rocky to rescue the masses from certain doom."
3,Harmonica Alert!,"First, let me say that I didn't hate this soundtrack. In many places, it's quite good. It does hammer on pretty heavily, but I suppose that's due to the pacing of the film. The only thing I wish I'd have noticed before purchasing this item was the presence of a harmonica in the score. With deference to the composer, it's used well, I'm just not a big fan of this particular instrument in orchestral settings.Overall, as a fan of soundtracks I wouldn't discourage anyone from purchasing ""Hard Rain"", there's quite a bit to enjoy here. However, I think that the painful inclusion of the harmonica means there's a bit to cringe at as well."
4,Rainbowed beauty,"This knife, a rainbow finished balisong from spyderco, exhibits the usual razor sharpness that this company is known for; in addition, its quality is also all spyderco. A simple squeeze on the handle unlocks thelatch so one can 'do the dance' with the aide of the hole each handle. Though the handles safety lock the blade while it is closed, they DO NOT lock once the blade is exposed ( thus the 4 star as opposed to 5 star rating ) which may be a problem to some users. Overall, however, I would quickly recommend this knife to a friend or even purchase another, which is unlikely, since in many areas in this country this knife in unlawful to possess/sell/trade/ship."
3,"It's okay, but not great","Nice interviews and some nice cars but that's about it. The commentator is just short of horrible and the overall production quality is second rate. The only real value is the interview with Balboni.No real information about Miura, Jalpa, Espada, etc. Instead of naming this ""40 years of Lamborghini history"", they should have called it ""the years when the Countach and Diablo were made"". Even then, this dvd just touches the surface on these two models. And the ""lambo angels""- what a joke! Third-rate strippers the authors of the dvd must have picked up at the Clairmont Lounge while they were in Atlanta."
1,What was with the eye candy?,"An average experience unfortunately. Enlightening interviews with Balboni, but where was the Miura in this 40 years? Seemed to be all Countach, Diablo and Murcielago, and irritatingly pumped up, underdressed tarts."
5,a terrific read,"Jackson starts this miniseries with a tremendously powerful hook. The plot flows beautifully, piquing the reader's interest and delivering a first rate tale of love. Randi's accident ties all three books together in an originally unique method that both resolves the love story, yet leaves the larger purpose unanswered in THE MCCAFFERTYS: THORNE. I eagerly look forward to the next installment of the series! Highly recommended."
4,The <cCaffertus: Thorne,Lisa is a great writer. I didn't like the sexually explicit scenes. Some thngs should be kept private and that is one area that should.
1,Japura Books,"Product is awessome, but Japura Books sucks! Ordered for a friend ... no response to emails ... no delivery of product ... no refund on undelivered order, which would have been late anyway!"
5,"THERE IS NO BAD LANDAU, BUT THIS MIGHT BE HIS BEST","I just saw the master last weekend and could only marvel at this amazing guitarist......on this cd the vocals and the compositions are amongst the best LANDAU has created with any of his bands.....not one average tune and some of the best guitar work you'll ever hear......none of the endless scales and neck arobics that often pass for music.....not one note is wasted and every one of them would be missed if they wern't there.....if you like the guitar, buy this cd as it might be the benchmark by which all others can be measured.......while your at it, buy everything by THE RAGING HONKIES and BURNING WATER....you won't regret it..."
5,EYE OPENER!,"THIS BOOK OPENED MY EYES TO THE CONCEPT OF WHAT IS GOD, SPIRITUALITY & HUMANITY IN A WHOLE. THANK U!"
1,Just Awful,"The song, ""Yellow Balloon"" is one of my most pleasant musical memories from my teen years, and I am definitely a beach music fan, so I hate to have to write this kind of review. The only reason I am doing so is so you won't waste your money. This has got to be one of the worst CDs I have ever heard. Musically... artistically...it is awful. I can't remember too many CDs I have bought that I felt this way about, but there is no doubt in my mind that I am accurately judging this one. As I played it for the first time, accompanied by my wife, I was embarassed that she knew I had bought it, especially when we got to the backward version of ""Yellow Balloon."" Please...find some way to preview it before your make the purchase...it's THAT bad."
1,16 lumps of sugar in my coffee.,"Not the Beachboys and definitely not Phychedelic. Sorry, but if I could have given this zero stars I would have. The Partridge Family are by far a more credible band."
3,Yellow Balloon - self-titled (Sundazed) 3 1/2 stars,"Originally hit the shops in 1967, as this was the 'sunshine pop' band's only ever album they did. I thought they played this genre a bit better than others from that same era did. Tunes here that sort of grabbed my attention were ""Baby Baby It's You"", ""I've Got A Feeling For You"", the band's namesake ""Yellow Balloon"", ""Can't Get Enough"" and maybe ""Follow The Sunshine"". Line-up: Alex Valdez-vocals, Paul Canella - guitar, Mark Andes - bass, Frosty Green - keyboards and Don Grady (My Three Son's Robbie Douglas) - drums. Should, without a doubt draw in fans of the Monkees, Lovin' Spoonful, Jan & Dean, Mamas & The Papas and Sagittarius."
4,nice toy for a baby with better hand control,I really like this toy but for my 4 month old they were too big to sling around without bashing them into her head. She will love them when she can slowly bring them to her face. She was very captivated by them and wanted to play right away. I will just have to help her for now. So overall this s a good product for a 5m+
5,Bright Fun Easy to Grasp,I bought this set for my 3 1/2 mo. old grandson to play with while at my house. All are bright vivid colors. One has a smiling fun face that makes my grandson beam in response to this friendly fellow. The fish is a nice size for him to grasp and hold on to. I know the other selections will be a hit as well when they are introduced. They are not BPA free as one reviewer has noted. I searched and searched for BPA free toys and found very few. I agree it does not make sense for bottles to be BPA free and teething toys not to be.
5,"I love this set, and so does my daughter.","I bought this when my daughter was around 4 months old, she's not 16 months and these are really great teethers. She loves pretending to talk on the phone too!"
4,great rattles,"My baby loves all 5 piece of the toys, she laughed the first time she saw them which is amazing.My problem with them is that my baby licks them, I don't know if they are safe for her since they are rattles not teethers."
4,daughter is starting to like the toys,My daughter is almost 3 months and is finally starting to like to play with the toys. she likes the rings at the moment and the phone!
5,Great Starter Set!,"We bought this set when our son was just starting to reach for toys, hold them in his hands, etc., and we couldn't have picked a better set. All of the toys have something easy to hold on to, especially for tiny hands.By far, the best in the bunch is that fish though! This has been his go-to toy for months now. I keep it stashed in the diaper bag whenever we go out, and he never seems to grow tired of it. He's ten months old now, and we're still getting use out of all five toys.As another reviewer said, everything can be washed in the dishwasher. I've also thrown the fish in with a load of laundry before."
1,Drats !,"Upon receipt this item appeared to be well made. It was vibrantly colorful and likely appealing to an infant just ""itching"" to put the pieces in his/her mouth. BUT....it was made in China! I returned it for credit. : ("
2,not good for teething,"i order this because my LO eat her hand often. i decided to give her this but she cried because its so hard. before i gave it to my LO i boiled them for 2 minutes. the mirror broke, the teether with rubber melt. i guess it was my fault. but i used to boil everything i bought before i gave my daughter."
5,Brilliant,"I LOVE Sassy products! They are amazing value and always do their job perfectly. My baby is now 3 mths old and loves grasping and mouthing toys. This is a really great slection, colourful, imaginative and fun. He especially likes the fish and holds him on every journey we make. I wasn't expecting this pack to have so many different styles and to be so well made, but it really is lovely. Buy it!"
1,Sassy Baby's First Rattle and Teether 5 Piece Gift Set,Not very entertaining for a 5 month old. Maybe she'll start liking the rattles as she grows a lil older.
2,Not happy with quality,"These are cute, but we are not impressed with the quality. These are a baby toy, and as such are going to get dirty and need cleaning. I briefly submerged these in soapy water and all except the butterfly got water inside the ""tube"" portions. They have taken several days to dry out and that's during the winter with low humidity. Mold and mildew are going to be a serious consideration. Also wondering what's going to happen once she starts chewing on the toys--is saliva going to work it's way in, too? Would be an ok product if they were sealed better."
5,New Era Of Hip-Hop,"Remedy is one of the most outstanding MC's I've ever seen. I've actually had the privalage of seeing this young man perform live, and he is just great. This album has all kinds of interesting beats and lyrics. The words in every song have a significant meaning. Remedy is a promising performer. Look for him to make it big in the Hip-Hop industry. This CD is a great buy!"
5,Never Again!,"I've only heard a few songs from this CD but the track ""Never Again"" is hands down the most influential song I've ever heard. It's touching yet the rhymes are really inventive. It's poetry at it's best, with a message about hate, genocide, and not doing the right thing. This song alone is worth buying this CD!"
5,code red,hot dont think you hear stuff like this no more anyone who said this album is not good dont know jack tracks hot and he gets to the point if you dont have it get it
2,What is this?,"I remember a few years ago anticipating the release of the white rapper affiliated with Wu- Tang. I first heard Remedy, as I imagine everyone did on The swarm with ""never again"" which impressed me thoroughly. I looked for more of his music, never to find anything.So fast forward 4-5 years later, to me at the record store. I see Code Red and think ""oh man, this should be good!"" I bought it without hesitation, and went to my car to give it a fair listen. I literally started laughing at nearly all the tracks. Was this guy serious?Luckily he included ""never again"" (even though he added on a ridiculous intro, and it seems as though the sound quality has dropped slightly), seeing that my Swarm cd was stolen. Exodus was humorous, but decent. All of the other tracks were forgettable. I actually wish I could forget how poor some of them were. I was really rooting for Remedy, but he left me a little dissapointed."
3,Remedy's Second Album,"A decent second album from the Wu-Tang Killa Bee and former high school classmate of RZA and other Wu Tang Clan members. The Jewish Holocaust anthem Never Again is included. Music is downbeat with pianos, strings and hardcore beats, no sappy party music here. There's also a song called Exodus, about the Passover story with samples from the movie. A Muslim and a Jew featuring RZA is a harrowing track punctuated with spare a sparse piano on the anger Jewish people feel over suicide bombings in Israel replete with references to current events, people and places."
4,Fantastic little treats!,"Growing up on Oreos and milk is common. So I was taken aback with the brand extension of Oreo's to cakesters. And while I had low expectations, I must say these are better than normal Oreos. Although I can't say it'll beat the combo of oreos and milk, these are fantastic treats and relatively guilt-free. If you like cake and like Oreos you can't go wrong with Oreo cakesters.The filling will bring you back to your childhood while the cake will provide you with a whole new Oreo experience. Certainly worth a try - guaranteed enjoyment!"
2,Cookie chips were not very tasty,Chips Ahoy cookies were not very tasty. My children and husband would not eat them. I tried to give them away and everyone refused.
5,Good snacks,Such an easy way to buy calorie controlled snacks. The arrived quickly. So easy to take to work or when you need just an easy snack.
5,Peanut Butter Cookies,"I enjoy them a lot and so does my son. I have to say that this kind is one of my favorites. It is full of peanut butter flavor that you forget that it is only 100 cals. As for the amount you get in the bag, it is more than I expecting so I was very happy."
2,Not The Best Cookies I've Ever Had!,"I was sorely disappointed in these cookies.. They are pretty tasteless and damn hard too.. I wouldn't buy them again and I've certainly tasted much better low-cal cookies.. I definitely recommend saving your money, folks.."
5,Great Purchase!,"Bought this DVD as a gift for my boyfriend who absolutely loves the Gipsy Kings. We were surprised to see how greatly produced it was, and the amazing quality of both the video and the audio. Really worth it! You can play it over and over again and won't get tired of it! The only detail is that the DVD cover is not as the one pictured in the website; its a guitar in much duller colors... Still, creates a great atmosphere!"
3,Good Performance with Equal Quality Audio and Video,The venue is interesting. Gypsy Kings fans will enjoy the quality of the audio and camera work of the band. Many of their hits are included in the performance.
1,Why the mystery?,"OK, so Amazon now lists three different DVDs that are all named ""Gipsy Kings: Live at Kenwood House in London."" So, are these all the same DVD, with different packaging? Or are they different concerts?"
1,A ripoff of several great movies,"I am watching this so called movie with DeanCain. I agree with others as to the poor quality of this film. Just a remake of several great adventure flicks. High Noon and Outland are fine examples of what evil/good should look like in a quality movie. Dark Descent has no depth, no pun intended, or acting displayed on the screen. Do as others have advised, rent or buy High Noon or Outland."
1,doesn't make sense,"I purchased this video because I am a big fan of Dean Cain. However, the movie was not prefaced with any details about what was taking place or where it was taking place and therefore the movie made no sense to me at all."
2,Under the sea,"This movie makes for some bizarre early morning viewing.Dean Cain stars as a marshal investigating minsers' suicides in the Marianas Trench,mourning his wife's death,and battling baddies with the help of nuclear explosives.He gets to mumble a lot,get angry,and beat up on his psychiatrist who has been giving evil drugs to miners.One wonders if the Marianas Trench were an undersea USSR,since most everyone has an Eastern European accent.Still,the movie is very unclear.Is it set underwater or underground? What is really going on? Where's the plot? In the depths of the sea,the plot has gone missing."
5,A picky police officer gives it two thumbs up,"I was skeptical, I am of most law enforcement related books that I read. Mr. Dunn, as you will see, has a very thoughtful and easy to understand approach to explaining something that no book will ever really accomplish. If you are interested in this as a career, buy it, it'll give you a clue and its worth your time. If you are already in the profession, buy it, you will learn something, and its worth your time. (you also wont be disappointed, trust me!)"
5,A must-read!,"Anyone with an interest in the LAPD or police in general will want to read this book. An absolutely excellent title that is well written and hard to put down. William Dunn has done an excellent job capturing the essence of the LAPD officer's rookie year and the difficulties of learning what they don't teach you in the academy - especially the art of dealing with people, both inside and outside of the department. The stuff on the interaction between the LAPD and gang members is top notch. I gave this one a ten because it's one of those books that I may actually read again at some point. The only thing I can give Dunn a bad mark for is the fact that he hasn't written another!NOTE TO THE AUTHOR: Please - write another!"
5,What They Said,I agree with the other reviewers. This was a very good book - so good I read it straight through in 3 days because I couldn't put it down. I was surprised at the job related hardships the author had to tolerate such as being forced to rotate shifts and constant evaluations for a year. Who can't relate to being chewed out for something or tolerating abuse from a bully as a new employee. I also found the author's perspective on the rodney king (lower caps intended) fiasco very enlightening. Throughout the book I alternated between wanting to be a cop and thinking it was such a tough job I didn't know why anybody would be one. The author did a very effective job at helping this ex-Detroiter to understand police work in an urban environment.
5,Best Police book ever,I got this book 3 days ago and couldnt put it down (well olny for school and work)it has great ingight tio the world of law inforcment and the people (dirty liberals and civil rights goofballs)who try to make a police officer's job harder . great book wish there was a police academy prequil
5,"ONCE YOU START READING, YOU WILL NOT WANT TO STOP!","I am a police officer in Milwaukee County, WI. I was told about this book by a fellow officer. He told me how exciting and action packed it was. He was right! I rarely read books that do not interest me. If your interested in law enforcement, READ THIS BOOK! It is a very real experience. William Dunn makes you feel like your in the squad with him fighting crime in South Central L.A."
5,Winterberry 16-pc Dinnerware Set,We purchased this item for my mother-in-law to add to her existing collection. Arrived quickly and all in tact. I was sure to check each piece due to other reviews stating a lot of breakage in shipping and was relived to see that everything was just perfect. My mother-in-law will be so happy! Great price on the set too.
5,"Great quality, beautiful holiday dishes","I love the Pfaltzgraff brand and have them as my every day dishes as well. This year I decided I finally wanted to add some holiday dishes to my collection and wanted something that wasn't too overpriced, but something of high quality that would last.The Winterberry dishes are just that; high quality (everything by Pfaltzgraff seems to be high quality), classic holiday look with the red and green (but not too ""Christmasy"" that I couldn't use them all winter long), and priced just right.I had no problem with the shipping/packaging from Amazon - everything came intact with no issues. I'm extremly happy with this dinnerwear set, and may consider buying another set so I have service for 8."
3,great dishes-poor packing,"These dishes are lovely and have stood up well under moderate use. However, when ordering, be aware that it is VERY likely some of the dishes will arrive broken as mine did. Since your only options are to return the entire set or keep the damaged items and receive a modest refund for them, it may be wise to order an extra set at time of purchase if you need the dishes by a certain date. It seems it would be cost effective for Amazon to invest in better packaging to avoid frequent returns/refunds."
5,Winterberry Holiday Set,Excellent product. Free shipping was fast and product was not damaged. Price including shipping was cheaper than at the Manf. Website.
3,Broken dishes as promised,"Pfaltzgraff Winterberry 16-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4As promised by other reviewers, I received some broken dishes in the set. Two of the salad plates were in pieces when I opened up the dinnerware set box. The salad plates are sandwiched between the dinner plates and the bowls. The dinner plates and bowls were unbroken. The box of dinnerware was placed in a larger box with some wadded up brown paper for packing. The outside box wasn't damaged."
5,More than Holiday dishes,Nice winter pattern that we will use all winter. Great Pfaltzgraff quality.
3,Shortchanged,I received my order only to find that I only had 3 of the 4 cups. Also the finish of some of the dishes is rough .
1,Damaged,"Received broken dishes. The box they were shipped in was too big and only had paper bag type packing material and not much of that. Received a replacement, packed exactly the same way, but nothing broken this time. Good customer service."
4,Delightful dinnerware,"Too many years ago, I saw this pattern and wanted to get the set. At that time, all I could afford were a few serving pieces and four footed mugs. (The line was still made in the United States at that time.)Fast forward to 2008 and the world of computers and global manufacturing, how could I pass up on the complete four-piece dinnerset for less than I paid for my footed mugs?The set is delightful and has been in use this holiday season. It looks great on the table, washes well and I've received many compliments.The only drawback is that the quality (compared to the pieces made here in the USA) is not the same and the color is ever so slightly off. Who says Americans couldn't manufacture great pieces? Still, the price fits my very tight budget."
3,"Great Price, unfortunately broken items.","Bought as a gift, but items arrived broken. Shipped items back to Amazon to replace, and replacement items arrived broken also. Going to deal directly with Pfaltzgraff to try to eliminate more broke shipments."
4,Christmas Dishes,"I like my dishes very much. This is the fourth setting of four that I have purchased. However, the handle on one of the cups was missing. Since I ordered this before Christmas I am unable to locate how to get a replacement. Most of the time one doesn't use a full set of cups but I would like to have it replaced.Pfaltzgraff Winterberry 16-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4Amazon picked up on my message and replaced the broken cup - now I am really a happy camper!Grandma B"
4,bought as a gift,"I found these dishes at the Yonkers store here at home. the pre-christmas sales were unbelievable at the stores, but Amazon beat them all. I bought the wine glasses and then came home and ordered the dishes for my sister's christmas. did not have to go outside, fight crowds, hunt down overworked and yes crabby seasonal store cashiers, or otherwise join the ""oh yea, oh yea and hurrah, it is christmas shopping time again in the city crowd"". Gotta love Amazon!"
5,nice dinnerware and good customer service,"The whole set is beautifully made, except one cup is defective. Contacted Amazon customer service via email at night, and received response next morning, and they have already placed an order to replace the whole set.Very satisfied."
1,Broken dishes and coffee mugs!,"My wife and I are planning a wonderful Christmas party and fell in love with the Pfaltzgraff Winterberry dishes. When we order three service sets for 4 they arrived at our home smashed inside the Amazon box. So we called and return them with requests for special handling on the reorder, only to find the reorder in the same shape as the first, Smashed inside the Amazon packing. Amazon put the Pfaltzgraff retail box without any padding in their thin box and shipped them to us UPS. What a joke. UPS are animals when it comes to handling fragile items. I can not imagine anyone receiving an order of these plates without them being broken, DON'T ORDER THESE FROM AMAZON! You'll be disappointed."
3,"Broken, Broken, Broken!!!!!!!!!!!!","Ordered 4 sets of service for 16 of Winterberry Dishes. Love the dishes. but, the packaging is terrible. Each set came in broken. Each one was worse than the other. They put 1 piece of paper in a box to hold the box of dishes. The box the dishes are in are ripped and broken. Amazon does replace them and the replacements come in packaged expertly. But try to make Amazon understand that 4 sets are broken. When you write them they tell you they have made the replacement. Yes you did but that was the first set.Well dont buy anything fragile. They don't know how to package"
2,broken again,after ordering 2 sets and both coming broken I realize I will not get one that is not broken. the dishes come in a box too big for them and there is only one small piece of paper to support the top of the box. the dishes move all over the place all the way here. I give up...
3,Inferior Quality for the Price,"Pfaltzgraff was formerly known for producing quality everyday dinnerware. I wanted a set of Winterberry for everyday holiday use, but couldn't justify spending what a service for 8 would have cost. Amazon had a great Friday sale, so I decided to treat myself. Had I purchased these at the regular price, I would have returned them. Their quality is definitely inferior and even my spouse, who normally doesn't say much about things like this, thought they were of inferior quality. Two of the dessert plates were smashed when I received them, but Amazon was more than helpful and is replacing them. I just wish the quality of the product had matched Amazon's service."
5,Psychiatry. Ain't it Great?,"Based on the novel of the same name by Andrew Neiderman; TENDER LOVING CARE is the story of a young couple that recently lost there doughter in a car accidet. The wife Allison goes into denial about the whole thing and believes her daughter is still alive. The husbend ,Michael, turns to the famaly psychiatrist for help. A nurse named Kythryn is hired to help. But there is evidence that she has accepted the job for all the wrong reasons. This is where you come in. You are asked a series of questions. Your awnsers to the quistions shape the story and ending. I have read reviews that say that there was little interactivity and that the questions were irrelevant to the movie. That is NOT true! This is as interactive as it gets. The endings range from depressing to gloomy and don't be fooled by the title. This movie is not tender nor is it loving nor is it caring. It's more like macarb, dark, and cruel. It's not for everyone. But it's still realy great! BUY IT!"
3,Blue Strawberry Cookbook,"It's a cookbook I've had for years and wanted to give one to a friend. It wasn't in quite as good shape as I hoped, but the point is the recipes, which are all there! The delivery time was shorter than estimated, which was nice."
2,"beautifully written, but not useful for this reader","This cookbook, witty and wonderful as it is, will never be very useful to me. I loved the narrative; I don't think I've ever read a cookbook so intently. However, this book does not suit my needs as a cook. The base ingredients are butter, flour, and sour cream, for instance. As much as I would love to eat liqueur-spiked sour cream-based dishes every night, I cannot. I don't have time, and need a more modern, health-sensitive approach to cooking. The writer's assertion that anything fresh is healthful is not accurate, obviously. I also disagree with the writer that anything combination of ingredients that one comes up with is wonderful...maybe needing only the addition of salt (paraphrase).In short, I guess this cookbook is too sophisticated for me. I consider myself a good cook with eclectic tastes, but apparently I'm not as sophisticated as all that.I find this book entertaining and inspiring to read, but not useful for everyday application."
1,Dil Se never arrived,"This purchase is not with me... Dil Se never arrived, or it did not arrive till today (Fen12th)"
3,The music is the best thing about this movie,"I'll make this short and sweet for those who don't want to read through ten pages of adoration for Shah Rukh Khan.I'm an American who loves Bollywood movies to the point that I don't really care to watch much from Hollywood anymore. Add to that the fact that I am a HUGE Shah Rukh Khan fan and adore almost everything he does. Even so, I just don't care for this movie. I bought it for the songs, and I feel that they are such winners that it doesn't really matter that I don't like the actual film that much.Buy this and watch the movie once... if you like it, then you'll be happy. If you don't like the movie, you can always just play the songs and you'll still be happy. The music videos are simply outstanding."
2,If you like sad films...this is it,I guess I'm into more of the happier Sharukah Khan movies. Both of the actors played their roles very well. Sharukah Khan is my favorite Bollywood actor. But the movie was just too sad. So if you want a tear jerker - here it is.
5,Dil se,"yep a fool who followed his obsession of love.You could look at it 2 ways a obsessed fool or a total way off loving someone,the beginning song ""video clip"" with the text where beautiful.since i looked at it many times it made me look at it different way as described above"
1,Worst 3 hours of my life,"Spoiler Alert. Don't get me wrong. I love Bollywood movies. I'm a huge fan of shahrukh khan. But this movie sucked. He meets a girl at a train station, decides he's in love with her, chases her all over India and in the end, she's a suicide bomber and she's strapped in the bomb ready to go kill some people, and they guy is begging her to just tell him that she loves him, and she just looks at him and he hugs her and they blow up. The End.This movie was about 3 hours long. That's 3 hours of my life I'll never get back."
5,Finney's foundational ministry,This shows how the fervency of Finney was effective in influencing his generation to seek God in a most profound way.
2,"Cool looking, can't set time, lousy quality","Okay...i'll admit I was sold by the translucent tangerine faceplate and the blinky lights. I was also sold by the fact that I could actually turn off the ringer (somthing not found in most of the cheap models). The price is right...it's cheap and ""disposable"". So...it does the job and earns some stars.What the phone doesn't do is why I it only gets 2 stars. Sure, you can set up options and language, BUT YOU CANNOT SET THE TIME!!! Stupid. Waiting for a callerID call to set the time by is just silliness that is NOT explained in the manual. Duh.The sound quality is tin-box and the range is sub-standard. I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE IF YOU HAVE A WI-FI BASE STATION. Seriously...i could hear the ""tick-tick-tick"" background noise of my router over this phone. They are on the same frequency and simply do not play well together.Oh well....it's good enouh to throw in my garage and use as a spare just in case."
1,My 8 year old thinks this phone is garbage!,"This phone has the absolute WORST sound quality of any cordless phone I've ever used. There is static and feedback. You can even hear an echo of your own voice back through the ear piece.On the plus side, the phone is really cool looking. The lights on it and the color are what drew me to it. I just knew that this was the phone for my daughter. I had high hopes for it as it matched my daughters new room really well. Even she doesn't like talking on it.When an 8 year old can tell the sound quality is too bad to bother with, you know it is bad."
1,Don't take it even for free,I bought 2 of these phones from Frys and they are horrible.The audio is not good. You barely hear properly and when you increase the volume to hear properly it makes a weird beep sound every time the voice pitch is high.The keypad sucks and if you have to use it as a touch tone phone when calling customer service to input your pin or other things it does not work at all.(...)But i think it is not even worth paying for the sale tax.
3,HARD TO HEAR ON,"THIS IS A VERY COOOOOL LOOKING PHONEE., EVERYONE LOVESS IT. ITS LIKE A CHRISTMAS PHONE. BUT YOU CANNOT HEAR WHILEE TALKING ON IT AND U SOUND LIKE TUNNEL. LOTS OF FEEDBACK LIKE A BABYMONITOR WHSTLING."
4,Have had for almost 8 Years!!!,"The battery is starting to go but am surprised it lasted soooo long. Seriously have had it almost 8 or 9 yrs. When first got i was 9 and able to work it (with manual in hand) and unfortunately cant do much because i can only remember a few of the nifty settings. Sound Quality great, features are cool and fun to play with when you have the time, lights are a flashy conversation starter bonus & kids adore(obvious purchase reasoning). I hate the buttons because in the past 3 or 4 yrs they have been crappy-im not sure if they were always like this, but when you dial a number and realize you missed a number or two(especially w/looong numbers) you dont exactly laugh it off (after multiple times). Overall: not a bad phone, but not top notch ;) For 45 bucks (i think) not a bad deal. Also bought expecting it to only work a few months but really surprised have been able to pull it out of the closet after a $90 phone going out."
1,purple phone,"The sound quality is really bad. On top of that, the functions are tricky. I'm usually great with manipulating phones, but this one is complicated. It looks great, but really that's about it. :("
3,Not a bad phone for the price,"I'll admit, I only ordered the phone because it was cheap, it was purple, and it had those really cool dancing lights. I wasn't really concerned about quality, as I don't talk on the phone that much. I've had the phone for almost two years, and the battery is starting to go, plus half the lights are burnt out. It is also getting to be very fuzzy while trying to hold a conversation, so I will be buying a new phone soon. I don't think I'll be buying another one of these, though. Once the lights burnt out, my fascination was gone."
3,It's okay for a cheap phone.,If you have teens because you don't have to worry about knocking these phones around they seem to be pretty sturdy. I bought 2 at about 17 bucks apiece. The bad part is that you can't turn the ringers off when you want peace and quiet. The volume returns to its low setting when you hang up so that each individual call requires a volume adjustment otherwise you wont hear the person speaking on the other end.
1,Bought for the 7 year old and she won't even use it. IT'S BAD !,"The only thing good about this phone is the lights, our 10 month old loves it. The praises stop there. VERY Difficult to use, the sound is horrible, difficult to even make a call. I have 4 other phones by the same manufacturer and those work great, but this one is not worth the $2.99 AR that I paid for it. Do not waste your time or money unless you want a toy phone for the 10 month old."
1,One of the Most crapy phone in Amazon,I hate this piece of crap. I dont call it as a phone. Its looks like toy. Never ever buy this phone. Voice quality is so bad that u cannot listen to other side voice. It will give all kind of noise and low voice. If u increase the volume it will cry like a hell but will not increase volume. I am going to throw this phone to trash.
1,Love Michael York,"but this is one ""h___"" of a bad movie. I traded it in even before I watched the complete thing. Just not my cup of tea. Sorry Michael, some of your choices of roles are disturbing to me."
4,made a difference,"I'm using this with sandals in the summer. I can't say the smell is totally gone, but my feet feel much more comfortable through the day than before."
3,Talking Spiderman pretty sad,The talking spiderman could have had some better lines than what it did....the little boy who received this...had more dialogue than this toy.
3,A lot more game now,"This edition has a lot of content - as much as Guild Wars. I enjoy it largely for the community however (massively multiplayer it definitely is), and am able to overlook the many bugs in the game, the paucity of CSRs to handle problems, and the seriously imbalanced RvR (I play on the Co-op server). The state of RvR may cause the game to go the way of the dinosaur however."
3,great game when it first came out,"This was one of the best MMORPG Game I ever played. There were countless race and classes you could play. Anyone could basically immerse themselves into the middle ages and fight monsters, craft weapons, and even dye their own cloths and armor. Only the elite and rich could afford those 30 gold dyes. Only knights and soldiers that are level 20 and up could wear shiny plate armor.So why did I give it only three stars?I didn't like how the developers are always balancing and nerfing certain classes. I didn't like instances, this made players disappear from the world. Back in the good old days, you could find people everywhere, sitting down next to a group of monsters, recovering for the next pull. But these days, people just power level themselves in instances and keep to themselves, and this has made the world a very empty and cold place."
2,Cardboard box physics for the lose,"When I got this game I was excited, I hadn't played in a few years and was ready to get back in to the swing of things. Right from the get go I was dissappointed. DAoC doesnt handle the way you think it should, its like controlling a cardboard box. The ideas behind the game were great but not now. If they re-did the game engine maybe id pick it up again..."
1,Don't buy it!,This is only the stupid 'making of' and not the actual explicit tape! Don't waste your money!
1,liquid City,THIS IS NOT THE REAL MOVIE THIS IS ONLY THE MAKING OF THE OF LIQUID CITYWAARNING WARRNING THIS IS NOT THE MOIVE THIS IS ONLY THE MAKING OF WARRNING
1,I got jacked for my cake on this one!!!!,"Mystikal on the cover with some nice thick booty freaks on the cover surely had me interested. Until I popped it into my DVD player! Going to the the local retirement home partying with the senior citizens would have been of more excitement and entertainment to me. ONLY BUY THIS VIDEO IF U HAVE MONEY TO BURN. I give it 2 toes & 2 thumbs way, way, way down. Mystikal U suppose to ""represent"" man, after watching this...it's a shame he would even agree to be pictured on the cover."
5,English Bulldog Woman's Grips,"The English Bulldog grips are well worth the investment. I bought these grips for my daughter and ahe has not been disappointed. She has been using English Bulldog grips for over four years, and has found them to be very comfortable, easy to break in, and durable. These are the only grips that she would like to use and has recommended them to others. Ordering from Amazon Sports store was a fast and easy way to buy the grips. They came within two shipping days."
4,Light Bar,"The light bar looked exactly like the picture so I was pleased. It was easy to install, however one of the screws and washer inside one of the light sockets had come loose and I had to put it back in. It was very small, so I'm glad I found it. That's the only negative thing about it though - works and looks great!"
3,Video and audio quality poor,An otherwise interesting take on the era hard to like because of poor audio and video quality. Be prepared to lose interest...
3,Dance with me.,"This soundtrack features a mix of an orchestral ""score"" and ballroom dance music. The orchestral music is okay, for what it is. But the ballroom dance music is a lot better. The ballroom stuff is a mixture of instrumentals and songs with vocals by Brent Spiner. Spiner is a good singer, for an actor. The ballroom music includes covers of songs by Tito Puente, Perez Prado, Count Basie, Huey ""Piano"" Smith, Kool & the Gang, Irving Berlin and others. But the best thing on the CD is Bobby Darin's recording of ""More""."
3,Funny,This soundtrack is very good for a laugh. You will find that listening to Brent Spiner sing Oye Como Va will make you laugh forever. The rest of the music is okay.
5,Simply the best!!!,"This soundtrack is simply a good, home-down feel soundtrack!!! Here's how I would rate the songs:1. Main titles- great way to start the soundtrack!!! [ 5 stars ]2. You're Our Guest- another great song to start it as well [ 5 stars]3. Cheek To Cheek- 5 stars4. Celebration- 5 stars- great dancing song!!!5. First Kiss/ Charlie and Liz- 4 stars6. Canadian sunset- 4 stars7. Oye Como Va- very funny!!!- 5 stars8. Mambo # 5- 4 stars9. Proposal- 4 stars10. Jumpin' at the woodside- 5 stars- another great dancing song!!!11. Sway- another grest dancing song, hilariously sung by brent spiner- 5 stars12. Nurse collins- 3 stars13. Sea Cruise- another great dancing song!!- 5 stars14. More- simply one of the jazziest dancing songs of this soundtrack!!!!- 5 stars15. Finale- 4 stars"
5,I Like it.,"It's bigger than I had imagined, and I needed to brace it on the side by putting a pad between the printer and the wall to keep the massive printing head mechanism from swinging it back and forth on top of the stand, but I simply followed the directions plugging stuff in, installing the drivers and the optional network card, and BAM, it worked. It worked really well. The quality of prints, on good paper, surpasses anything I've gotten back from a photo lab. Granted, part of that lies in the ability to optimize the pictures directly from the raw format of the camera until printing, but we haven't even set up the calibrated monitor yet or a customized printer profile. I look forward to seeing the results we get after we get more meticulous about the process."
2,print head clogs,Great printer but do not let the print heads dry out. I had to let me printer set for a few months without using it due to a medical problem. I have have to buy new ink for all eight colors twice trying to clean the heads. It would have been cheaper to buy another printer
2,Didn't Like It.,"I bought this a while back and didn't like it at all. In fact, I just threw it out. I got no manner of coverage at all, and I wasn't expecting much! J It didn't even out my skintone or make my face look better in the least."
4,Lunch Lady Land.,"The soundtrack to Adam Sandler's EIGHT CRAZY NIGHTS is a high-charged, hilarious romp through the eight nights that make up Chanukah, the Festival of Lights. The album feels like a toned downed version of some of Sandler's previous comedy albums, but set to music.My particluar favorites on the album are:""Davey's Song""""Long Ago""""The Chanukah Song (Part Three)""""Davey's Song"" is actually quite depressing, but memorable and melodic nevertheless. ""Long Ago"" is a romantic love song that gets interrupted by a sudden tragedy. And of course, ""The Chanukah Song (Part Three)"" is the next part to Sandler's most famous holiday song. The album does contain some foul language, and because of that isn't quite family friendly. However, if you have a warped sense of humor or a fan of Sandlers, you will probably enjoy the soundtrack."
1,All reviews appear to be written by the same person,If it so good why would SOMEONE bother writing the same review over and over again. I have written many of covered calls and 25% is a bit lofty for a return. Look into more honestly reviewed/written books for details/strategies and see what you can do experientially. Start small and watch what happens to your returns on an annualized basis. Have an exit strategy before you start.
4,Outdated But Still Valuable,"Outdated at the scholarly level, this is still a good narrative account of the meandering flow of alchemy. Sober yet appreciative."
5,Crumbsuckers,"That stuff will blow your mind away. I'm over 30 and still remember the Crumbsuckers, you sould also definitely check them out."
5,Everything I need,"I love this tool! I've owned many different multi-tools, and while some offer features this little leatherman doesn't have, the Sideclip offers all I really need: a good knife blade, a couple of screwdriver tips, and needle-nose pliers with wire cutters. Most usefull, though, is its handiness; relatively compact and light, I clip it in a pocket in the morning and forget it is there until I need it. Like all Leatherman products the Sideclip is solid and well made, plus it is cheap at thirty bucks. Great tool."
1,Sadly disappointed,"This Leatherman was so stiff that I bent back my thumbnail trying to open it. Oiling improved it only slightly, but not enough to make the tool useable. I have returned it for a credit, which I await. Sad."
4,Second fave,All I have to say is that I own all of the sleaer kinney cd's and these is m second favorite.
5,"OhmyGod! Crank it & meet bliss (and say, hey, how ya doin')","Which album is better? This one or ""Dig Me Out""? Who cares - just get them both, now. Think music in the 2nd half of the 90s sucked? You weren't listening in the right place. Call the Doctor's first song, the title song, just kills (interestingly enough, the same can be said of the lead-off song on Dig Me Out). It roars with such a fierce energy that you may find yourself breathless (did for me). Little Mouth, Anonymous, Stay Where You Are...every song, all the way through the final notes of Heart Attack, hits. Among the best of the 90s (80s, 70s, etc.), easy. Great rock isn't dead, it's just back to where it was before Nevermind made it seem like some cool new thing - raw, full of energy and passion, and largely unheard. Here it is, something you can make special and your own, once again, just like when you were a teenager with telephone pole flyers on your wall. Take it from an old (relatively) guy."
5,Absolutely Essential.,"A transcendant jeremiad against patriarchy, Sleater-Kinney's sophomore album is required listening for fans of good music. Corin Tucker's amazing voice plumbs almost unbearable depths of passion and desperation, while Carrie Brownstein's work on guitar mixes intricate melody with pure power. The synergy between the two is a joy to witness. 30 minutes of pure, delicious punk."
5,Better than good...,"CALL THE DOCTOR: This album is a masterpiece of all things sonic, queer, and emotion excavation. It's really that simple. That this album was somehow humbly crafted in the shadow of grunge's flavorless armpit and riot grrrls's gnashing vagina is unthinkable to me. Also, for the record, one cannot endure the soul-raping, heteronormative panopticon without these brilliant pop songs. Trust me. (Still my ""go-to-album"" for dealing with all crises and breakdowns -- be they identity, emotional, academic, communication, nervous, etc.)"
4,An Eye-Opening Book,"What a wonderful book. I really felt as if this book explained a lot to me, not only about Japanese Women but also Japanese culture itself, and how it relates to women. It also painted a very accurate and intricate historical picture. Anyone interested in Japanese culture should take a look at this. It's really quite fascinating!"
2,very good book but horrible condition,"I love jack l chalkers novels and this novel i loved a lot the story was like watching a movie thats how good chalker writes but, finding an unused jack l chalker book on amazon is like mission impossible the book i recieved in the mail was in bad condition i mean i have used books from ten years ago which are still in mint condition so there is no excuse for selling a used book in poor conditon. i hope amazon.com gets some new jack l chalker novels which are unused afterall jack l chalker would be hurt to know his fantastic sci books are being sold to people as hand me downs."
4,This Is a good Book,I think this is a good book but not for younger readers. It has some inapproprate parts to it. Otherwise it is a great book.
3,a bit too scary for a 6 year old,"We've loved every other one of the Magic Tree House series, but this one (although interesting to me, the parent) was a bit too scary for my six year old son. We only read half way through it and that was it for him (the mummies were too much for him -- yet he didn't mind the ghost in the Wild West book). So parents, be prepared for this one if your child is young or a bit sensitive."
3,Mummies in the Morning is Great,"When I first got the book, I thought it was going to be boring because it was about mummies. I had never read about mummies before. When I read the book, it was exciting. It was fun when Jack and Annie went on their adventure. I would love to read another Magic Treehouse book"
4,Mummies,Another fun filled adventure with Jack and Annie. My five year old had trouble visualizing this story because we haven't had much exposure to ancient Egypt. He still enjoyed the suspense and fast paced action that is characteristic of all of the Magic Tree House books.
3,Mummies in the Morning,I read the book Mummies in the Morning. This book is a great. I liked when they went in a pyrimid. It is anamazing.It is a good book. I learned some interesting facts.I learnd that their are false passges. I learned about hirogliphics. I learned also about tomb robers. I would recommend this book for three resons It is an interesting book. It gives some facts. It is an exciting book. Mummies in the Morning is a very good book.
4,Book Review By Matt B.,"If you are interested in fantasy fiction books like this one, read this review. At the beginning of the story, Jack and Annie go to the pyramids of Egypt. In the middle of the story they find an Egyptian ghost from the past. She is trying to look for four egyption symbols. To find out what happens to Jack and Annie, read this book. I gave it 4 stars because of it's mysterious ending."
4,"Mummies in the Morning book reveiw by Matthew Broome, 3-29-07","Mummies in the Morning, by Mary Pope OsborneIf you're interested in fantasy fiction books like this one then this is the book for you. At the begining of the story Jack and Annie go into the treehouse and wish to go the pyramids of egypt. In the middle of the story they find a egyption ghost from the past. she is trying to lookk for four egyption symbols. To find out what happends to Jack and Annie, read this book. I gave it five stars because of its mysterious ending.By Matthew Broome"
5,I really liked the story!,"This story was so good that I got in trouble while reading when I was supposed to be asleep. I am saving for the next book, and I will be sure I will read it before my friends do!"
3,Mummies in the morning,Great book! So educational! This book teaches you a lot about Egypt and Egyptians from the past. You should read this
4,my kids loved it.,The whole series is fun. My 5 and 7 year-old like to have a joint story at night...and these are great for that!
1,Inappropriate for younger children!,"I can't believe that no one has commented on the subject matter of this book being highly inappropriate for young children, and entirely unsuitable for young Christian readers. I am not one to shun children's fantasy books, and we've enjoyed the other Tree House books, but this one is not for a five year old. Jack and Annie help a ghost queen find the ""Book of the Dead,"" containing magic spells that will help her pass through the underworld (a place of horrors with lakes of fire, monsters and demons). The ghost queen has been roaming around for a thousand years trying to find this book. This nonsense, along with detailed descriptions of rotting mummies, make this book one to skip in the series."
5,My favorite one yet.,These Magic Treehouse Books are great informative books for kids. My niece loves them and got me interested in them too for fun. I liked this one best so far. I liked the ghost queen!
1,unbelievable,"I can not believe that this album received such positive comments. I bought it because I liked the orginial Stargate Soundtrack by David Arnold and tho I do not watch the series frequently I still like its music. But this CD is just shameless money making. It contains only about 4 minutes of music from the TV-series composed by Joel Goldsmith, the rest of the 52 minutes is completly taken from the orginial movie recording. If you think you get to listen to new material on this one, forget it! All they did was to re-edit the Arnold score, blending sperate pieces of music into new ones or shortening others. The result is just aweful! Almost as if the laser of your CD-player is broken. The songs are not all homogeneous, but they remind one of a badly made video-clip. Jumping from one melody to the next without an introduction, stopping in the middle of a tact and so forth. By all means: don't buy this CD!"
5,Enjoy this soundtrack SG-1 fans!,"This music builds on the epic work of the movie. Although shorter by reason it still conveys the epic scope of the original story. This music is almost the study notes version for the original soundtrack in its tone and demeanor. It does what it does and that is, help convey the scenes with a graceful flair that only adds to the show itself. This is a great soundtrack to own if you enjoy the show."
5,Worth it,"The theme song alone is worth the price. Play it in your car and try not to hum along, it's impossible!"
2,Not an oil pan gasket,"This part is not an oil pan gasket. If you need an oil pan gasket and order this part, it will not work."
5,Montana on my Mind,"Gorgeous scenery with inspired technical and artistic talent combine to make an exploration of the land, the plants and the creatures an adventure that is never dull, never tedious and bears little resemblance to ordinary travel advertizments or documentaries. I bought several copies to distribute to my children and friends."
3,"Bought with enthusiasm, hasn't worked for me","I was motivated to buy this book by the positive comments I've seen. I can certainly recommend this book for teachers who may be inspired by Mrs. Yurko's philosophies about children and music education. But unfortunately, most of the activities in this book require proprietary supplimental items (sold by Mrs. Yurko, if I remember correctly) and only a few of these activities can be pulled out to use without a good deal of preparation and materials. If this isn't a problem for you, I can definitely recommend this book. It is a problem for me, and though I flip through it from time to time, I've never used it in the classroom."
2,Not Practical,"I agree with the other review in that this book requires way too much preparation before each activity. Although the activies probably to do work well, the materials that you need to either create or buy are necessary in order to present an effective activity. I think I used about two lessons in my classroom, not practical at all."
4,"Darkly funny, magical story","Asher and the Capmakers by Eric Kimmel isn't precisely a folktale. This delightful story is rather an interweaving of folktales from many traditions. Asher runs to the neighbor in the middle of a storm to borrow an egg for the family's latkes. First he becomes lost, but eventually, he comes across mysterious fairies who wear magical caps that can wisk them away to the Pasha's Palace in Jerusalem.While set at Chanukah, this book doesn't teach much about the holiday--which is fine--but it does thoroughly entertain.I'd recommend this one for children 5 to 10 years old. It's a little scary for the youngest readers."
5,great spoof of vintage horror!,Fans of old school horror will love this one. I did! The characters based on Lugosi and Karloff are extremely funny and Randall Malone is the lead actor and he's perfect for this type of material (although Conrad Brooks steals the show). I loved every second of this and all fans of vintage horror should check out Hollywood Mortuary for a good time.
3,it's not that bad.,It's no 5 star movie but if you like old corny movies you will like this. It's just dumb enought to be ok. I am not upset that I bought it.But the tape wasn't what I thought it was . I read it wrong. I was dissapointed about that.It's a movie about a horror effects artist who wants to bring back old horror stars. He has to dig up their bodies & turn them into zombies.
1,hollywood mortuary,The movie was not that good to be a horror movie.I will give it a 0% beause it was boring!
5,awesome toy for delayed babies,"my daughter is 6 months old and developmentaly delayed. She has a hard time holding onto a toy and bringing her hands up in front of her body, and with most toys all she can do is look at them. This toy, however, is very light and easy for her to hold and pull up to her mouth to chew on. It makes a nice little clacking sound which she loves and it holds her interest for a lot longer than other toys do."
3,It does the job,"The T794 increases volume about 50%. The best feature is the USB power suppy. I do presentations and I am always on the road. This allows me to do a quick setup and I don't have to worry about IT dept. slowing me down. I don't have to look for power outlets and carry an ext. cords.This product has been a great little friend, being on the road a lot, I can jam in my hotel room, and it takes up very little space. I use boosteroo with Harmon Kardon ball speakers and my laptop and/or Ipod and I have a nice sound systemPros- very small, USB Power supply, connect mulitple speakers,Cons - not much power"
3,"Booteroo volume better, but not as loud as hope.","The amplifier worked as described and I was able to increase the volume normally going to a headset, connected instead to the Boosteroo and then by a Y cable to the audio inputs on a digital television set. I have no electronic measurements, but only a subjective opinion that I could increase the volume 20 to 30 percent. The volume increase definitely helps, but I would like more. I like the fact that I can control volume with the TV remote rather than using the volume control on the laptop."
2,Boosteroo has tiny boost,"I have 2 previous Boosteroos and they were fine,this one for the fine is worthless-it has a TINY amount of boost-maybe a 30% or so volume increase at most.NOT worth the money, I am unlikely to ever buy a boosteroo product again. The vendor was very good, the product stinks."
2,"Scorching Kill Your Sons, blah everything else","When I first heard Live in Italy, I was a VU fan somewhat leery of solo Lou, and had my head turned around by the fire-breathing version of ""Kill Your Sons."" That led me to buy a copy and, at the time, since I didn't have any solo Lou, I really got into the solo songs (except for the stupid ""Martial Law"") but thought that the versions of VU songs were lame. Now, however, I have the studio versions of just about all of these songs, and find just about everything on this album lame, and its very existence pointless, with the exception of ""Kill Your Sons"" which is actually better than the version on ""Sally Can't Dance."" So, overall, I recommend seeing if you can download an mp3 version of it somewhere, and skipping the rest of this disc."
5,Lou reed- Live in Italy,"Fantastic, glorious. this is much more than what I thought. You got it and you got a fantastic live on concert"
3,Lou Reed Talk-Sings on this,"I love Lou Reed - but I really can't stand that talk-singing thing he started doing in the 80s. This is a pretty unremarkable disc. Some of the Robert Quine work is worth a listen if you can find a cheap, used copy."
2,"unfortunately, not all that good","You would think that with this band, this would be a great disc, right? Sadly, it's not all that great. Lou and Quine were at loggerheads at the time. As a result, Quine's guitar is oddly muted and minimized on much of this. As much as I love Lou Reed, and I do, he will never be the guitar player that Robert Quine was. This CD suffers, as a result, from Lou's lack of guitar skills - even on his own music, by his own standards. The second thing that makes it a not-buy is Lou's refusal or inability to sing. He simply shouts his way through all the songs. The third reason to give this a pass is that there are no dynamics. All the songs are played as loud as possible, meaning that ear fatigue sets in a little over halfway through. It begins to sound very samey after a while. Lou's best live set remains the semi-bootleg ""American Poet"" album. Even for a Lou Reed fan, this is not a must, I'm sorry to say."
2,"No fue para mis gustos, pero no es tan malo","Ya que Olga Tan~on es conocida por sus merengues eso era lo que esperaba de este album, su ultimo cuando me lo compre. Desafortunadamente eso no fue lo que encontre aqui. Este es mas un album de pop latino, el cual me aburre fatalmente. A los que les guste este genero quizas les guste el album, pero si eres merenguero ni pienses comprarlo."
2,Very disappointing,"Sobrevivir gets off to a promising start with the engaging ""Por Tu Amor"", but after that it is all downhill.""Easy Listening"", ""Middle of the Road"", ""Spanish Pop"", or my favorite pejorative ""Wall to Wall"" all describe the rest of this album.Routine ballads are the dominant element, and I can't distinguish one from the other. In between are a few hoaky up tempo songs.I'm sorry - Olga is one of the greatest Latina singers of all time, and this is not the direction I want to see her go.Yo Por Ti is the only different, yet creative album she has done since abandoning pure merengue back in 1997. Too bad."
1,"Very, very bad production","If you are a fan of latin music, don't waste your money in this album. I recommend you to buy the CELINES album called: HISTERIHA. The CELINES'new album called HISTERIHA has real merengue. Buy HISTERIHA by CELINES instead SOBREVIVIR by Olga Tanon. All the puertoricans in the island are very dissapointed with Olga Tanon for this bad album."
2,What's that?????,"I'm also very disapointed about this producion.It seems that Olga didn't understand that people want her as a merenguera and now I dunno what she wanna be or what.Hell naw don't waste youre money on that bull/#""%@.I aslo recommend HISTHERIA by a talented de la flor de merengue Celines.And for Olga,hopping that youre next cd will way much better than that mess."
2,Not the original,"The original game is great, with tons of stickers that don't slide and make it possible to have tons of acres to harvest.But this version comes with interlocking puzzle pieces that slide all over the board at the slightest bump, and less pieces so you are more limited. Buy the other version."
4,"Real life, educational","This is probably the favorite game of our family of six. Whenever we ask the children what game they want to play as a family, they almost always say: The Farming Game. It usually takes us about 2 or 3 hrs. to finish a game.As a mother, my favorite part is that each player is independent; you win or lose by your own decisions and chance. You don't win by putting everyone else out of business - you win by having the most money/assests when someone calls 'time.' This is great in not creating hard feelings and angry exchanges among the players. Nobody ends the game with a grudge towards someone else.We have had the game for at least 10 yrs. and it is still a family favorite."
4,A little complicated?,"My mom said this was a little hard to figure out, compared to say monopoly.IDK it seems like they like it."
4,The Farming Game,"This game is a really fun game for teenagers, and adults. It teaches you how life really is as a farmer. My family, and my extended family love this game."
5,Best Game EVER!,"I grew up in Eastern Washington playing this game ALL THE TIME. It's great because you play not only against other players, but also against nature and luck--just like real farming. The key to winning: Fruit. Buy all the fruit you can. Cows are good too.There have been many a night when several of us have stayed up 'till the crack of dawn playing the Farming Game. Running out of paper money doesn't have to stop play, just make up a few really big bills from post-its, paper shards, whatever, and keep playing. So much fun!I caught my mother trying to sell my childhood game of this at a yard sale for 25 cents. I still play that one, but the pieces don't stick to board quite as well as they used to 20 years ago. Oh well.Buy this game. You'll love it. Enough rambling...got farming to do!"
4,It is a Christmas gift,"So, I had a little trouble thinking of what to get my sister and brother-in-law for Christmas this year. I had narrowed it down to a game of some sort, and I was originally going to buy them Cranium. I happened across The Farming Game, and it seems really interesting! I ordered it a couple of days ago, and it arrived via the mail lady today. (I was extremely happy about that). Thumbs up to the senders! The plastic wrap on it was torn a little bit, but that's understandable. The post office, in my opinion, doesn't care what's in the box. Overall, I am excited to see them open their gift, as it is unusual and different. :) I gave four stars for everything because since it is a gift, I have no idea what it's going to be like."
5,The FArming GAme,This is a great gift for families.We have given it many times and everyone enjoys it.We got it as a gift and passed it on as we liked it so much.
3,Kiss the Score,"Kiss the Girls is an Great addition to the collection of anysoundtrack fan. But the soundtrack is only about 32 min(score only). This CD is over all not as good as Along came a Spider.If you Start it at track 5 ""Kiss the Girls"" and you will say ""this is a cool soundtrack"".... what the heck were they thinking when they put four songs on the soundtrack. Keep up the good work Mark."
3,2 appendages up(thumbs),"Code Hunter stars Vanessa Marcil (90210),Adrian Paul (highlander) and Bai Ling (red corner)with appearances by Tone-Loc and Coolio. ""It is about a giant storm controlled by satellites that threatens to destroy both american coasts. The only one who can stop it is the renegade hacker known as the jester. A virtual reality game gone haywire forces him into the deadliest, and most real, game of his life"" review by blockbuster Code Hunter has superb acting on the part of Vanessa Marcil and Bai Ling. Adrian Paul plays his cool self as usual Nick Cornish's performance is a little over done but the movie as a whole is worth watching. I rarely give a four or 5 star rating ex: 5 Star Lord of the Rings, Highlander 4 star: Time Cop, The One Maybe that will help you as to the rating. This is again worth watching. I own a copy!!"
4,pleasantly suprised,I thought this would be like a B movie but I was pleasantly suprised. It was really a good movie with a good plot. I thought the little tribute to highlander at the end was funny.
1,What the hell,"I know what the product says on the cover, but I was under the impression the 'biography' was maybe some information along with this cd.It turns out, this cd is just simply a British woman narrating their problems for 13 tracks or whatever. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. There should be a clear description saying this is not music. I know, it probably was my stupid mistake, but Im sure Im not the first, and Im sure I wont be the last.Someone has to make the mistake first, and I did write about it. Dont buy this cd if you want music. I was extremely angry when I found out this was no music."
5,Adams Chronicles,Great characters of history come across as very human. This helps us understand the motivations and determination that drove one of our most influential founding father & the personal costs that his public life caused.The Adams Chronicles
5,Finally!,"At long last, the ""Adams Chronicles"" miniseries is coming to DVD. Anyone with any interest in American history will enjoy this great work. The recently-deceased George Grizzard does a stellar job as John, William Daniels (accustomed to playing John Adams in ""1776"") is remarkable as John Quincy, and the rest of the cast is not too shabby either! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
2,disappointing,"I'd heard much about this 1976 series and purchased it because of the glowing reviews on Amazon.com. In fact, it isn't very good. The TV budget was obviously minimal, and the acting is soap opera quality (everyone seems to shout, as if on stage, and at times you can almost read the script). As for the history, well, a great deal is left out, and one can imagine most people being quite confused. The makeup is the outstanding feature of the series (although the line of the lead's bald spot is sometimes visible), which says too much about this lengthy series. It's wiser to invest the time in McColloch's biography."
1,Not what I expected,"Not too bad when it comes to history and learning about the Adams Family through the years, but it lacks production value and character development. This series is like watching a historical documentary that was written and produced to be an adapted English Romance novel. The first few episodes are marginal and the series goes down hill shortly after. The makers of this series also need a lesson in lighting. Awkward shadows mixed with ultra bright faces takes the viewer our of the 1800s and into a low budget 1970s studio. I would not recommend this to anyone other than a die hard John Adams historian."
1,Poorly Done,"This was a disappointment after watching ""John Adams (HBO Miniseries)"". Characters, script, filming, settings seemed to be of very low budget quality."
3,"Interesting, but not outstanding.","I found the earliest part with John & son John Quincy the best. I thought the John Adams mini series dvd (from HBO) was outstanding, & this series paled in comparison. It still was entertaining, had not seen it in 1976."
4,rev war reanactor,"i really enjoyed the adams chronicles, good acting through allthe series on the adams family. from john adams in the revolutionthrough the life of his sons and there contributions. all hadlived a life of integrity honesty and folowing in there fatherslife except one of his sons who had a drinking problem. i learnedmuch about the history of the adams. i would recomend this seriesto anyone who loves the history of this country and those whohelp establish it."
4,Adams Chronicles,The item was recommended by my very discerning American brother in law who says it was better than the more recent series on John Adams which I thought was excellent. Time will tell as I have not had the opportunity to view the DVDs yet. Perhaps over Christmas.
4,Great American history,I watched The Adams Chronicles when it was on PBS and enjoyed it very much. Now I am enjoying it even more.
3,Disappointed!,"Apparently this series was just copied from tape onto disc without any sort of touch-up or restoration. So after thirty two years since this series aired this is what we end up with. Well, it is better than nothing but far from everything digital dvd has to offer. Just imagine what this series would have looked like if Lowry Digital were called in for their services."
3,Transition Beyond Tradition,"Tsa'ne Do'se's latest release ""Transition Beyond Tradition"", is an ambitious album. Fans of the Native Amerucan Flute are well advised to purchase as many Tsa'ne Do'se albums as possible. Although I prefer his solo efforts where the mastery of this man shines, his newest release features some pleasant melodies and all the technical skills fans have come to expect. The album is beautifully packaged and definitely one you will be talking about."
3,Nice book but...,"I bought this for my brother for Christmas. The first time it arrived the cover was worn. So I let Amazon know and they sent me another right away (in time for Christmas again). Although the second one was better the cover still looked worn. I just thought for such a nice product on the inside, the outside didn't look so great."
4,Classic Cult Movie,"Considering its time of release, it's undoubtedly a classic cult movie. For those who could not stand awesome and disgusting scenes, it's better to avoid viewing it. As the Chinese edition of this movie is not available in Hong Kong, I have no choice but to order a U.S. edition. The director of the movie Kuei Chi Hung is a versatile artist who died in the U.S.A. in the early eighties, a real loss to Hong Kong movie industry."
4,"Great tool, but only if you need it","Like every Leatherman tool, the Tool Adaper for the wave is a great tool. but while the wave is recommended for almost anyone, and whatever you do in your life, you'll probably find it very useful, the Tool Adaper is for people that really work with the wave. if youm use the Leatherman wave in your work or for more then ""once in a while"" the Tool Adaper can help you get more from your wave. it a really good tool but not a ""must have"" tool"
3,Quality Tool Attachment,Nice to be able to attach driver heads to the Leatherman and comes in handy.
2,Definitely not a help for adoption,"I hoped this book would offer help to adoptive families. It does not. I felt the author was hasty in deciding that the majority of issues coming up in life were race related. One story in particular shows that her daughter is learning the same as she uses the ""race card"" easily herself."
4,"A ""Grand"" tradition","It is very captivating and fun to watch in the tradition of English period dramas. Some true-blue characters and some all out rattlesnakes and villains. And, also some enigmatic, fascinating ones. It captures the period in history that witnessed the emancipation of women, the rise of the middle class, the aftermath of World War I, the advent of socialism and the fast-paced hedonism of the ""Roaring '20s."" First rate costumes, sets and music enhance the production. The acting is consistently good and the very human plot themes hold the viewers interest from one episode to the next. The complete series of 18 episodes makes for an enjoyable month's worth of escape into a fascinating period of history."
3,The Grand,"This may be a matter of taste, but I did not like the subject matter. The acting was very good but the bad guys were really bad and good guys were not good enough. Thanks, Jane"
2,Melodramatic Let Down,"The first season was fairly entertaining. The Grand Hotel owned by a family, troubled children, and rivalry brothers, topped off with a dysfunctional staff filled with their own issues. The first season started off well, but I soon tired of Marcus and his less-than-honorable intentions. The epispode dealing with the young maid raped and hung for defending herself left a bitter taste in my mouth. It seemed frankly...pointless.The second season went from fair to just plain bad. Two of the characters were switch out with a different actor and actress. The personalities changed dramatically in the husband/wife couple, and the soap opera became boring and unbelievable. I didn't finish the second season, but just flipped through the descriptions not really caring how it ended.Not the best."
2,"If I want to be this upset, I'll just watch the news","Am abandoning The Grand. Too depressing, too much violence. Watching this is like going to prison. I watch British period drama to escape reality, and I feel as if the writer took all the misery left out of other period dramas, cobbled it together and handed us this. Susan Hampshire plays the only character that I wouldn't shudder to meet. Avoid, unless you enjoy witnessing relentless suffering and injustice."
3,"Mildly entertaining, but still worth a watch","This was something I found on Redbox. I did not know what to expect, but what I found was a series that contained a number of episodes that offered glimpses into the lives of service workers in post World War One England. It does get a bit gossipy at times, but it is still worth watching. Why? Well, because it focuses on the lives of these people that highlights the drama and struggle of everyday life. Even though it is gossipy, the drama and poignancy comes through and that is what is worth watching. Just be warned that it is not as elevated as some other British drama series."
1,"Really disturbing, Got very tired of all the violence soon on","After the 3rd disc, I had had it with this series. I like Susan Hampshire (Monarch of the Glen was wonderful!) After the 17yrs old girl is hung for being raped and brutalized by 3 men-after she kills one of the attackers, that was it for me! Tragedy after adultery, prostitution, homosexuality, violence and arguments and sarcastic remarks. Never a funny or bright moment. I couldn't take it anymore! horrible. I wanted to like it-hoping it would get better."
2,The Grand,I hoped to get much more out of this series than it really had to give.The plot is interesting but the events are miserably negative. You almost wish for something good to happen.The Grand did not generate any positive energy for me. Even the end was puzzling and disappointing.
2,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of British drama. I have over 100 DVDs in my colleciton. The Grand is full of wonderful actors but the writing and directing of the series is poor. The sudden, non sensible turn of reactons and emotions were silly most of the time. The story flows some how and is some how entertaining but makes you cringe at the same time. I don't know how to explain it. I have never watched a British movie or series quite like it LOL. I personally wouldn't recommend it but some may like it. Oh, and it's definitely about the seedy side of old Manchester if that's your cup of tea."
2,Very depressing,"I truly enjoy most British productions of this type, however, after giving these a try and enduring, yes ""enduring"" 3 or 4 of these episodes, we just couldn't take it any more. Although the plot of the story is sometimes a bit entertaining, however, the overall after taste we had after watching each episode was sour and depressing."
4,Entertaining series,My husband and I viewed this series over the Christmas holidays and found it quite entertaining--though not as good as UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS. It ends a bit abruptly. Definitely worth watching though.
5,Heron - Britains best kept secret,"This is a CD full of haunting melodies. This was mostly recorded outside, at a farm in Black Dog (a little village in Devon, England)in the early seventies. You can hear birds singing and the wind through the trees between many of the tracks. ""Yellow Roses"" is one of my favourite tracks - though the complete album is so relaxing that it is perhaps unfair to pick out individual tracks. Heron have returned to Black Dog recently, and recorded again! ...."
5,Extraordinary,"""Wings of the Dove"" is one of the most compelling scores i've ever listened to. Every time i listen to it, i get reminded of how beautiful the movie (and helena-bonham carter of course) was"
4,Great movie!,"I've got a house full of girls and they loved watching this over and over again! A nice, clean Christmas movie for the kids."
5,Pooh-riffic!!,"This is one of the cutest Pooh movies out there. I bought it for my grandson who actually wore his first one out. It is his favorite movie; he goes to bed with it every night. It is cute because it teaches the values of friendship and working together. And the songs are cute & catchy, too. If you like Winnie the Pooh, you'll love this movie."
5,Nana211,"My Grandaughter loves this video. We first saw it on the Disney Channel. With her right now anything Winnie the Pooh is a hit, but she enjoyed the singing snowmen as well."
4,More exciting Pooh,"My daughter had seemed to outgrow Pooh within the last few months, but these new Tigger & Pooh Super Sleuth movies are for a slightly older crowd. My 5 year old loves them! Good job Disney!!"
1,Not the Winnie the Pooh we know and love,This DVD sucks. It was such a disappointment that the characters are not their usual enchanting selves. They are in name and general appearance but the voices and personalities are completely different. This is definitely Disney trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of the Pooh franchise.
2,A pointless advertisement for other Disney properties,"This video is a major disappointment. When they say a run time of approximately 44 minutes, they mean it has seemingly an hour of advertising for other Disney properties before, during (Super Sluths) and after the main story. While the characters are technically Tigger and Pooh, it is as if the Disney computer generated the whole movie from a mix of scripts and characters fed into it. Very patronizing."
4,First rate,"Stunning, detailed account of the life of Charles Lindbergh; one of a handful of pioneering aviators with the vision and passionate zeal to advance the cause of commercial aviation. A very personal, and revealing study of the man who, in his record 34 hour flight from New York to Paris, changed the world in ways he never dreamed of; for the catalyst of his flight was the start of the Air Age. Well written and lavishly illustrated with photos rarely seen from the Lindbergh Family Album. Anyone remotely interested in aviation should read this book, or view the film ""Spirit of St. Louis""."
3,Works,The product itself is pretty cheaply constructed. But buying several as backups kept me from needing to buy a whole new weedeater just because this part broke.
1,This Part Doesn't Fit ALL Black and Decker Bump Feed Trimmers,"My model number was no longer visible on old 12"" bump feed Black and Decker trimmer (had an attached glued-on label that fell off years ago), so took a chance that this product fit it, but it did not. If you're looking for a bump cap that is approximately 4.25"" outer diameter, with an approximate 1.75"" inner diameter hole, this is NOT the product you're looking for. Have no idea where to find the part I'm looking for."
1,Waste of Money,Waste of money: the size is too small and it is not strong for the purpose. In a minute of use it falls apart (in two and then many more pieces)
5,Multiple Uses,I am the director for my church's VBS and I purchased this item to make a pyramid. The gold is the perfect color for a pyramid and it turned out great. Just wanted to give you an idea for multiple use.
1,Defective disks,"I purchased 2 packages of these and tried burning 4 disks from one package and 1 disk from the other--each with different content. My burner showed the burns as being successful, but, when played, each disk faltered at about 70% through. The disks would then intermittenly run and pause for about five minutes before normally playing again until reaching about 95% of the recording before freezing completely.As it's a real bummer to watch 95% of a recording and then not be able to watch the ending; don't buy Matrix disks."
1,Garbage,"Absolute garbage. I bought one pack to try and save some money. I won't buy anymore. You get what you pay for. Every single one of these are coasters. A complete waste of money. The problem seems to be right at the layer break with every one. Do yourself a favor and avoid these at ALL COSTS!!Want premium quality at an affordable price? Go with Amazon.com's ""Amazon Basics"" media. In my experience they're the next best thing to Taiyo Yuden and that's saying something. Taiyo Yuden is the top of the line in storage media."
1,Skip this,"Bought these awhile ago (25 pack) when on sale, and of the 6 discs I've burned so far across 2 different burners (LiteOn and Samsung), none of them work. The burns complete successfully, but the discs just can't be read.I burnt them at 2.4X; tried ISOs and simple data files, used Nero, Alcohol, Imgburn (InfraRecorder wouldn't even recognize the discs)... all to no avail. Evidently from the other reviews, there ARE some drives that can read them... just not any of mine!Not sure if Amazon still stocks them, but in case they do, skip 'em and go for something more reliable/compatible."
2,Not really worth it.,"DL DVD+R's are usually (in my experience) twice the price of normal DVD+R's and so this spindle seemed like a decent purchase. But my Nero external DVD burner on my PC & the DVD burner on my Macbook Pro were not fond of these blanks.I made more coasters with these on my PC than any other brand of DVD+R DL that I've used and not once could I get my Macbook Pro (that was bought in June of 2007 with a 2.4GHz Processor) to burn one at all.Fortunately, the Wal-Mart near where I live had their Sony DVD+R DL 10 Packs mispriced and I was able to finish the project I was working on."
1,This is real trash!,Folks - Save your time and money. Stay far far away from this product. I regret to give this junk even one star.
3,"Old DVD Writer could write DL discs by verbatim and other brand name companys, but not these, my new pc can use them","I had these discs put away among other what I had thought to be useless electronics/accessories, in fact I had them put away in the trash after wasting a few in my old writter. Once I got a new computer I thought hell why not if they don't work now the I will toss them. Ends up they work only downside is how terrible generic and slow they are at 2.4x it can take up to 45 mintues to write a dvd, but the bottome line is they do what I need them to do, but DL discs in general (especailly these) should be way cheaper DL discs are way over priced!"
1,Bad Product,"Stay away from this media. As other reviews suggest, you will be lucky to get a good burn. I've tried in three different dvd burners with minimal success. I suggest you try the Matrix 8x speed double layer media instead if your burner can handle that speed. I've had much more success with those. I also recommend the Memorex double layer dvd's as they have worked very well for me also."
1,Don't buy it - Zero (0) star.,"First layer writing goes well. On double (second) layer writing, you get error message after writing less than 1 GB, and it stops burinig. I have tried 5-6 times, and it has failed each time. I have a recent SONY DL bruner that otherwise works fine.I am using it as single layer DVD (at a burn speed of 2.4x !!!). Money wasted."
4,Xtra spices from MF Doom,"MF blessed us with beats that he and his collaborators made over the years that he spit over. Some of the beats are just loops from R&B songs but they are good too. Not going to say too much about a instrumental LP but if you are into production and love to freestyle over underground beats, this is for you."
4,For those who seek more Doom,"Ah yes, Doom's special recipes. The standard of quality on the entire collection is relatively high. This one happens to be my current favorite because he does mix in several beats that you've already heard (assuming you're an MF Doom fan). I would usually want to hear all different beats, but this is a fantastic compilation of some of his best instrumentals. The mix starts off with the relentless scratching of ""Saffron"" (Operation Doomsday title cut), then moves on to the jazz inflicted ""Arrow Root"". ""Coriander"" is the beat from Doom's cameo on the Monster Island Czars album. ""Shallots"" boasts an effective dirty guitar sample nicely. ""Monosodium Glutamate"" (""Rhymes Like Dimes"" beat from Operation Doomsday), ""All Spice"", and ""Lovage"" are smooth and sexy joints. The tweaked out super villain voices and cuts on ""Red #40"" remains a strong cut as well. Overall, there's plenty of tasty beats to hold a Doom fanatic over until he drops his next LP."
4,good instrumentals,these are alright but if you already own the original albums such as KMD and opreration doomsday their is really no point in buying this unless you are a completest. These beats are fun to freestyle over if you are into that sort of thing but I enjoy MF Doom much more with vocals.
2,Whole Album?,"Coriander and Eucalyptus are the best tracks out of this compilation. The other tracks are ok, but might sound better with vocals. Until HEY is released as a special herb, I'll be very disappointed."
2,Mediocre beats cd from MF Doom,"This, The 1st 2 volumes to the special herbs series is just a collection of beats that sound like they're outdated and much of these beats i could never see any rapper rapping to. The only beats that were worthwhile on this cd are ''Shallots'' [The best beat by far on this cd] and ''Saffron''. If you're a dj or an mc looking for good beats to use, Don't get this cd. Judging from how dissapointed i was in this cd, I wonder if the other 4 special herbs cds are any better. I do not reccomend this cd, But if this is your thing, Go head and get it. Peace out, Be blessed."
1,Ian Fleming Chick Lit,This may have been Fleming or his publisher's idea to sell more books to a female audience. If you are looking for the real Bond he is not here. This is the most sexually graphic of the Bond novels but from the female point of view. It is claimed that the first romance novel was written in 1972 but The Spy Who Loved Me preceeded it by 10 years. Instead of riding in on a white horse to save the damsel in distress he appears in a T Bird with a flat tire at a cheap motel in upstate NY. Did Fleming really write this?
3,Refreshingly different Bond story,"An unusual Bond novel because written in the first person voice of a woman. Perhaps more than any other Bond novel this is nothing like the film of the same name. Bond only comes into the narrative in the final act to save the heroine from a nasty fate at the hands of two viscious gangsters holed up in a run down motel in the Adirondacks. The suspense builds well and it's quite a page turner. Hitchcock always wanted to make a Bond film and this would have been the one for him to do, with its American setting, creeping claustrophobia and damsel in distress. This Penguin series has a cool (though racy) set of retro covers that draw on elements of the story. My copy came from the local IGA store in Kingaroy, Qld, so you never know what little treasures you'll find among the supermarket novels."
4,"Good book, okay voice acting","This is a Bond book taken from the perspective of someone he meets, and so we see him as others might see him: a dangerous man, but by his actions and charisma making him the sexiest spy, now and forever.The voice actor Samantha Bond... not trying to be unkind, but her mispronunciation of ""Adirondack"" drove me nuts and broke my attention away from the story, every time I heard it. If not for this I would have loved this audiobook.Listen to the other books read by Rufus Sewell and he will spoil you. You'll never want to listen to anyone else read again."
3,Super Reader,"The Spy Who Loved Me is very different from the other books, as the story is told from the point of view of a woman, who eventually runs afoul of a couple of gangsters.A long way into the book Bond turns up and has a confrontation with the crims and gets the girl. With SPECTRE finished, they are still looking for Blofeld."
2,This is NOT the best of Fleming!,"Well, after writing so many wonderful books Ian Fleming obviously thought he could get away with writing a bad one. There are a few good points, the character of Vivienne Michel is well written, but the first half of the book is nothing more than a soppy love story (or two, come to think of it) and Bond doesn't even appear until the last third. The villains, Sluggsy and Horror, are dirty, unsophisticated gangsters rather than the usual dignified megalomaniacs. I can't say how many times better the film is."
4,Page turner,Beautifully written....I saved numerous quotes on this book and couldn't help but imagine Daniel Craig while reading. First Bond book I've ever read and from a woman's point of view I enjoyed it...
3,Different...,"I didn't hate this book like some Bond fans, but its not the greatest either. I do commend Ian Fleming for taking a different approach in this 10th book in the Bond series. By this point, the template was pretty much the same: supervillain has some plot to extort money or work for SMERSH or SPECTRE, and there will be a damsel in distress whom Bond rescues, etc. So with that in mind, The Spy Who Loved Me is completely different.The book is told, first-person, through the eyes of Viv, an emotionally scarred woman who sets out to travel through American on her vespa and ends up the target of an insurance fraud scheme by some New York gangsters.Bond doesn't show up until about 2/3rds of the way through the book, where he predictably saves the day and beds the girl.While the signature template of the Bond novel isn't there, this is a unique telling of one of Bond's adventures and does a nice job of filling in the time between Thunderball and On Her Majesty's Secret."
1,Really?,"First Bond book I read in over 7 years, and I am HIGHLY disappointed. This 164 novella took over 100 pages to introduce James Bond. Really? That is like reading a book about the Revolution without mention of Thomas Jefferson. The plot was HIGHLY uninteresting and nothing to do with espionage, and rather bland. Bond just happened to go to Washington D.C. and happened to have a flat tire outside of the setting. Really? I'm glad this bore was a quick read.Feminists would abhor this book - as the main character uses sex to placate a man."
3,Ian Fleming earned this much,"As other reviewers have pointed out, The Spy Who Loved Me is an experiment, written from the first person of what in other books would be called a ""Bond Girl"". So we get a bildungsroman for that type of girl -- tough, beautiful, good driver, 20-30, but sexually disappointed (if not damaged; I won't spoil it). And we see Bond, then, not on a mission but rather during a hiatus, passing through the Adirondacks. He appears more flawed and uncertain of himself than he normally does. The enemies, too, are less diabolical. The stage set is far smaller. The weapons far more ordinary. This is James Bond looked at without the benefit of the narrative insight of an expert ex-intelligence man (Fleming's default narrative voice). Is it good? Not very. Is it fascinating when read as part of the evolution of James Bond? Yes."
5,Frightening and revealing,"The research is painstaking and relentlessly documented. Statistics and anecdotal evidence are interwoven flawlessly, bringing home the human reality and demonstrating the full scope of the problem. I recommend this book, without qualification, to everyone concerned with reproductive politics regardless of where they stand on the prolife/prochoice spectrum."
1,Don't waste your time,"As expected, if you like some honest information about the US, you got the wrong book. It contains America-bashing done in both the High Tory way and radical-left fashion. Honestly a better portrait of America could be found among Bill Bryson's books or from ""How We Talk: American Regional English Today"" by Allan Metcalf."
4,Misunderstood - 'Before The Dream Faded' (Cherry Red) 4 1/2 stars,"Recorded in 1966,but not released until umteen years later(or so it appears).Great garage / psych piece of work from another short-lived;1963-1969, yet under appreciated band. Most impressive tracks were ""Children Of The Sun"",""My Mind"",the semi-trippy ""I Can Take You To The Sun"" and ""Who's Been Talking"".Line-up:Tony Hill(of High Tide)-guitar&vocals,Rick Brown-harmonica&vocals,Glen Ross Campbell-steel guitar,Steve Whitway-bass and Rick Moe-drums.Should appeal to fans of The Creation,Pretty Things,Chocolate Watchband,The Seeds,Count Five and The Move.An absolute should-have."
4,Forget the Count V,"Forget the Count V. The greatest Yardbirds xerox is the Misunderstood's ""Children of the Sun."" Campbell was to steel guitar what Jeff Beck was to the Telecaster. For fans of garage/psychedelia, this is a must own. Not as essential as ""Black Monk Time,"" but pretty damn good."
5,Misunderheard before their time faded,"Essentially this collection which is not quite an album features a Yardbirds-like band who coulda been contenders if they'd had decent management---they were that good. It's circa 1966 and the sound on this CD is thin in the production-values department, but Glenn Ross Campbell's eerie, coiling pedal-steel playing makes all of the tracks fat and throbbing. A psychedelic punk jewel... buy it now before it's remaindered into obscurity again!"
5,Item As Described,"This fan clutch assembly for my 1998 GMC Sonoma V6 arrived in good time, maybe 3 days. It was packed in an ACDelco box, which was shipped in a larger box surrounded by packing paper. The clutch assembly appeared in new condition and was an exact match to my OEM unit, except there was no clear markings on the new unit indicating it was the same as the old. The new unit bolted right on to my water pump, and for the last week it has performed as it should."
3,Solid Hot Dog Cookery,"If you want to cook with hot dogs, this is the book. ""Over 250 new and exciting ways to fix this old time favorite"" says the cover, and it isn't kidding. Loads of mayo, cheese, and cream are part of the charm. Accent flavor inhancer is used throughout. Very simple to read and reproduce the recipes, no difficult ingredients to obtain or challenging techniques. Preparation times are clear, most can be produced in under an hour. It opens with a well written history of the hot dog and covers Hors D'oeuvres, soup, salads, casseroles, main dishes, sandwiches, vegetables, in dough, gourmet and grilling. A very complete index. This is an excellent cook book on a very amusing topic."
5,Tub Toys-Totally Terrific!!!,"As a former teacher, I am very careful about the books I select as gifts. I was wonderfully surprised when I read Tub Toys, preparatory to purchasing a gift for a grandchild. This little book is not only well written, it is funny, educational and beautifully illustrated. I'm so pleased to find it and plan to get a few more as my friends grandchildren will benefit immensely , also."
2,This is certainly not the best of all possible Logic books.,"It is hard to believe that there are not more reviews for this book. If you will be using it in a logic course you would be well advised not to take other difficult courses with it. If you work and go to school, you would be well advised to plan on budgeting significant quantities of ""free time"" for meeting with your professor and having him explain difficult areas of the text. This course here could really mess up your GPA. While I think this text is capable of teaching you how to think logically, you had better already be a logician to handle its difficulties."
4,Buddha is the transition,"This is an overlooked wonder by Bowie, primarily since importing it is the only way to get it. After finding it, I truly see where the departure from his 80's ""fall from integrity"" got its firm foothold. This is the missing link that explains the leap from ""Black Tie.."" to ""Outside"", alright to brilliant. A must for the true Bowie child."
4,excellent,"Buddha Of Suburbia is an album even some hardcore David Bowie fans don't know about. This was done for a TV mini-series of the same name in 1993.And is among Bowie's best: this has the gloss of his early 1990s work likeBlack Tie White Noise. Diverse as that album is, Buddha Of Suburbia may be even more so. The score is a mix of dance music, someLodger-like pop, ambient, and even free jazz. But the smooth sound makes the album completely cohesive.It is simple but true: David Bowie is a master musician that can make any music he sets mind to. This is pooff."
3,"Worth a listen for those who liked ""Outside""","This soundtrack for what I believe was a Japanese film has, like many soundtracks, some very worthy music interspersed with some filler. I found at least three of the songs to be above average Bowie compositions, and nothing on the album is really tough listening. ""Buddha of Suburbia"" shows a Bowie who is once again finding his artistic stride, one that he would hit more directly on ""Outside."" ((Bowie fans should listen for the ""All the Madmen"" reference on the opening cut.)"
1,Wait'll you hear this!,"Okay, if you thought that 'Never Let Me Down' or 'Tonight' was a big disappointment, try listening to this. I don't know about you, but I found this one just as boring as 'Tonight'. There is no fast music at all and I wasted all that money! Track two is the strangest song ever, and this album's version of 'Strangers When We Meet' is awful! In my opinion, don't even bother!"
2,Missing Ingredients,"Bought this book with the expectation that the author would give the reader some guidance on how to create dishes without always relying on a recipe. What you get instead is 7 pages of autobiography in the first chapter. The next chapter, ""About Flavors"", is only eight pages, which is filled with vague, hand waving observations on flavor. After a sermon entitled ""Pep Talk to the Reader"", the rest of the book turns into yet another cookbook based on specific dishes or treatments. The author made no attempt to extend his flavors framework about flavor marriages, flavor oppositions or flavor juxtapositions to the rest of the book. Spots checks on individual recipes didn't bother to show how they might exemplify the ideas set for in ""About Flavors""."
5,Worth every penny!,"Was looking for some inexpensive, nice looking rings and took a chance on this. I'm happy with everything about this ring. It's light weight, keeps its shine. I love the different colored stones in it. You can't really lose on this one. It's exactly as it's pictured. Arrived very quickly. Purchased other rings from this seller and all have been perfect. Look for sales, though. Some of the prices are kinda high. But, the styles are nice."
5,"When you want a brand name hose, buy this","This is a real Gates hose and as long as you know the model number you need, buy it and save yourself the hassle of driving to the store for a simple hose."
1,horrible,"these bags were cheap, but not worth it at all! they fall apart and you dont want that happening for what you use them for!"
2,Not a great representation of Hispanic lit.,"This novel about several Puerto Rican people who (are supposed to) have something in common is not well written mostly because of the author's mediochre grasp of English, and because of a disjointed plot which doesn't come together well. For better Puerto Rican literature try the ""Boricuas"" anthology."
5,Jadite,I highly recommend this particular book. The information is easy to read and there a many good quality pictures. You can find specific products and price information with ease.
5,The bible of Jadite,"My exposure to the wonderful world of Jadite is very recent. While I have learned most of what I know off the Internet, a complete guide with a huge number of photographs for the bookshelf was imperative. It is also easy to carry on those forays to antique shops.This collector's book is comprehensive and a valuable reference. My only criticism is the lighting used in the photos. Many are difficult to discern the various patterns and details. It could have been improved with some back-lighting.This is, however, the collector's bible for Jadite. And, at Amazon's low price for a hardcover book, don't put off ordering your copy! It is a beautiful edition."
5,Cute Little Tiger - Son's Favorite,"We purchased one of these tigers for our 6 month old son at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. It quickly became his security toy, and he absolutely had to have it when he went to bed. A few times it had gotten dirty, and was in the wash when it was his nap time, and that was a disaster - he would NOT sleep without it. We were very worried about what would happen should it get lost or destroyed - and since we don't live close to Las Vegas - we didn't want to take another trip there just to buy him another tiger. Luckily we found that Amazon sells the exact same tiger that the MGM Grand does. It was a life saver."
4,Sound advice,This is a book for the layman because the text is understandable and the information is useful. It doesn't go into depth but does provide a good overview about preventing diabetes. Research indicates that a person can't reverse diabetes but he/she can take preventive steps to change the course toward diabetes or lessen the effects once diabetes has developed.
3,Important notice,"This book is a fun read, though it contains far toomuch extraneous material and too little Necronomicon.Readers should note, however, that Colin Wilson has sinceadmitted that this book is not actually a decoded ancientmanuscript, but a hoax concocted by him and his friendsthat is not meant to be used as a grimoire. This willnot matter to some, but those for whom authenticity andaccuracy are more important than occult practice should bewarned."
2,Devil's Advocate,"Yes, for the record, the _Necronomicon_ is bogus. It is a bastardization of Sumer-Babylonian mythology twisted by the nightmares and imagination of Lovecraft combined with a knowledge of magick ritual and structure as well as a bit of tongue-n-cheek. A magnificent demonstration of the power of the imagination. Beware lest in the dark of night you too hear the call of Cthulu. All in all, reality /is/ in the mind of the beholder."
5,The Ancient Ones rise...,"Though its veracity is still questioned by fans of H.P. Lovecraft and most occultists, the Mad Arab's book is, at least, an excellent overview over the ancient Sumerian polytheism and demonology, with all incantations, seals, ancient texts (as the Urilia and Magan ones, somehow similar to the Gilgamesh epic) and the Abdul Alhazred's (a.k.a. The Mad Arab) testimonies. Definitely no child's play.."
2,Lenormant-Laurent connection,"Given that ""Science Occult; La Magie chez les Chaldeens ; by Lenormant"" and ""La Magie et la Divination chez les Chaldeo-Assyriennes; by Laurent"" have been mentioned, be it known neither of the volumes mentioned record the word NECRONOMICON, nor any likeness. One can assume that 'NECRONOMICON' is simply a fictional rendition of the title 'BOOK OF THE DEAD'. There are several of these from several areas. Assuming that a book called NECRONOMICON did exist prior to this century, there is no reason to assume this volume would be it. For a magician, objective validity is as much about truth as is belief. A certain store in New York, called THE WARLOCK SHOP, are variously claimed to own originals, though they will not visually verify. Only the publishers of the book make any connection, though the hoaxers were likely aware of these books, and kept them in mind during authorship. Interesting, but valueless."
2,Long winded breath from hell...,"Ok, I admit it. I am a Necronomicon junkie. I have them all. The Simon, Tyson, Hay, De Camp, even a couple 'Pulp"" fanzine style versions. I love it. The legnths people will go to to line my shelves with as many copies of a book that never existed. Well, until now. Sweet.Anyhoot, The Hay version of the Nec is not one of the better ones. Although it is famous, there is precious little Necronomicon in this Necronomicon. The loin's share of this book is devoted to Colin Wilson's rambling indignation of Lovecraft and his oh-so-interesting-if-you-are-a-dry-british-critic story about how he came upon this vile volume. The basic premis of Wilson is this;Lovecraft was such a hack writer with so little imagination or talent that he could not possibly have made it up. Therefore, it is real.Yep, that's it folks. That's the big secret!Damn you, Colin Wilson, for insulting H.P.! Maybe i'll go send one of the demons from the Simon version to harrass him."
3,Profanity!,"This is what I have learned after a lifetime of studying and practicing. The Necronomicon Is Very Real! The title is wrong though and Abdul is Not the author. The Real book had no title and was written on 600(not 666) klay tablets by an unknown(to most) Sumerian priest some 8 THOUSAND years ago! Later the Ancient Egyptians made several copies of The Book. All later Grimoirs are only fragments of copies of those tablets. The title ""Necronomicon"" is pretty fair though. ""The Book of the Dead"" would be even better. BE WARNED! Do Not Ever try to practice Anything from theese fragmented copies unless you are Very well prepared!"
1,Crockranomican?,"Yep! A crock! Anyone who takes this book seriously should have thier head examined and submit to any form of brainwashing which may come thier way! A more fun version: The Necronomican, used in FRPGs is much more entertaining!"
3,This CD is at best a novelty item.,"Chaka Khan should stick to what she does best...not jazz. The best part of this CD is the fact that the sideman are so good. You have Freddie Hubbard, Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Joe Henderson, and Lenny White. Face it, you cant go wrong with a combination like that. If anything, buy the record to hear these guys play together. The biggest problem with this record is that Chaka Khan is just way out of her league with the sidemen, she just doesnt quite measure up. However, one great thing about this record is that it prbly exposed some ppl to jazz that would have never considered listening to it before. That being said, this CD is still a novelty item at best. Kind of like Garth Brook's foray as rocker Chris Gaines....Sorry I take that back the Chris Gaines thing was a little harsh."
4,Clement is a cool cat,"Clement Greenberg does an excellent job of explaining how the individual and society experience and identify art. His essays on avante-garde, kitsch, and modernist painting are especially interesting, although his socialist ""tendencies"" tend to undermine objective discussion and mix art and politics (not always inseperable anyway, though). If you read Greenberg, you should also check out T.J. Clark, who takes issue with many of Greenberg's ideas."
2,"Dense, Unreadable, Ridiculous!","The most dense incompressible use of the English language I have ever come across. You can pretend to understand his what his wordy word words mean, but good luck. I believe he has a list of big words he intends to use and over use until the core of what he is say is so obscure the reader can only pretend to enjoy or understand what is going on. I am not questioning his expertise only his ability to communicate what he knows. Simply Painful Reading."
4,"Great, but I am glad Mikael kept his day job...","Ressurection through carnage is a pretty intense work of art. Fits very well in the Death/Gore Metal genre. Blast beats, rugged guitar, gutteral vocals, dark and violent lyrics, the works. I really like this CD, though I hate most metal of this kind. I was suprised because I was a little skeptical at first to listen to this album. I admit that I snagged it up because of the sole fact that Akerfelt is the vocalist, and his vocals are ferocious and raw. The guitars are decent, with no riffs that will blow your mind, virtually no bass, as is usual in this genre. The drums are decent.Overall this album is average at best, and I am thankful that Mikael left this band and went to work full time with Opeth, nuff said."
5,not your run of the mill death metal....,"Bloodbath is somewhat of a super group, and it shows. This album takes classic death metal to new hights, amazing vocals (provided by god- mikeal akerfeldt of opeth), haunting melodys, and fast paced verses. One of my favorite things about bloodbath is they're not the ""lets stay basic"" kind of death metal band they experiment quite a bit on this record, its really entertaining till the very end. This is one of the best death metal albums ive ever bought, great stuff"
2,Very sad..........,"This album is very dissapointing, love Nightmares Made Flesh, and have heard the new Unblessing the Purity and its good so thought i would go and buy the older album with the same singer as the new ep. The vocals are good enough, but lack the range and personality of Peter. Production is ridiculously poor and guitar sound is a joke. This is supossed to be a super group, must have had no super producer. And the drummer, ehhh the drummer, don't know where he came from, but it must not be a death metal band. If you want Bloodbath then get Nightmares Made Flesh it is lightyears ahead of this cd."
4,"Intelligent, brutal music","I think they were trying to achieve a classic ""melodic death metal"" sound (classified by many) on this side project which was suppose to be a tribute to death metal. This is one of those albums that just captured something great. I can't explain it entirely. There is so much corny stuff out there -this has style."
4,Good Program,"I was very pleased with this. I use Excel at work all of the time & found this to be very close. So for the price, I was thrilled."
4,Office Suite 2006,I received my order in a timely manner and it was very easy to install. I am very happy with my order
1,Crap,All it did is mess up my files. I can't open WordPerfect files anymore and this software doesn't accurately open all Word files. Don't waste your money.
2,OFFICE SUITE 2006,WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE A TOOL ON IT SIMILAR TO OUTLOOK. I HAD NO USE FOR IT.
3,no title,"I dunno, this series seems to be losing steam, but I can't quite put my finger on it. This one was definitely better than ""The New Men"", but not nearly as riveting as ""Time of Hope"", ""The Light and the Dark"", or ""The Masters"". I get the feeling that Snow has distanced himself more, is being rather more detached and objective. He had to bring his son near death for him to see into his nature and come to finally understand his core being. Wasn't there some other way? How autobiographical is this series? I would love to know. Still good, however, and definitely worth the read."
5,"A facinating, suprising book with intriguing answers","If you are very comfortable with your understanding of the problems of the inner-city, don't read this book. Roth writes in a very readable style, but he produced a challenging even startling book. His analysis of the interplay of inner-city problems is penetrating. He shows how these problems multipy each other rather than merely add to each other. He shows very compellingly how the social science establishment ignored what was right in front of them, because the truth was not welcome, and how public policy makers made foolish choices because of bad social science.This is a facinating book. A real eye opener. You may be uncomfortable with what you learn, unless you are ready to deal with reality. This book is a must for serious students and scholars of social policy."
3,Software Issues,"I bought this cd-rw because it was less than $100 and I was hoping to be able to plug it in and start burning cds with no problems. It installed very easily, but the software wouldn't even work on my computer, which I found strange becuase my computer is HP all the way. The box says that it is Windows ME compatible, but whenever I even tried to install the software on the disks, I got a big blue DOS error screen. Now my problem is finding software that will work without having to pay a lot for it. If you are interested in this cd drive, I recommend buying software for it right away."
5,Pretty cool!,"Nice graphics, just like watching the movie! I loved the comic book style, great way to get a younger generation into the star wars world."
2,Disappointed,"I was greatly anticipating receiving the small chest, but when it arrived I was very disappointed. The picture does not show the true color of the chest. Instead of the burnished gold, it is a rather dark brown, not nearly as appealing as the picture. For the price, this is a huge disappointment."
3,Does the job but not the right size,"This filter is hard to find, as the other reviewers state. It does not come ring shaped. Rather, it is shipped flat, with a couple of folds. You have to reshape it to fit in the humidifier.Also, it is a tad small. You cannot form a complete ring with it. That probably reduces the dust reduction factor of the humidifier, which is one of advertised factors in the listing (""virtually eliminates dust"").However, since the original filter that came with the humidifier was a perfect ring of the perfect size, the customer is being short changed with this product. There seems to be no alternative to it, however.Update: I recently (Mar 24) purchased two MAF-2 Essick Filters at homedepot.com less expensive and exactly the right shape and size. Fit easily into the humidifier just like the original one. So, I would say, get this only if the homedepot one isn't available."
2,Filter Quality and Prices,"If you want your humidifier filters to last longer, then use filtered water and an additive to the water to prevent bacteria, as well as mineral build up. We use Golden Solution Combination by Vista Solutions. And if you want to pay a much cheaper price for these filters, go to Lowe's and look for IDYLIS Universal filters. They are currently $8.98 each. We have an Essick Moist Air Humidifier model 12010, and these filters fit fine, though they are boxed flat and have to be shaped..."
2,There good for a couple weeks,If you clean you unit often this filter will fall apart from handling it once it's been wet and it gets a lot of build up at the top from the minerals in the water. Some filters have metal reinforcement and that may help prolong the filter but this doesn't. Just play on buying one or two a month. I add a tsp of bleach to my holding tank every other fill and that seems to keep the bottom part clean and don't have to take it apart to clean every couple days.
1,Smelled bad for first several days so gave up.,"The original filters worked fine, as did an identical replacement filter I bought at a hardware store. Both had black rubber backing strips. I bought three of these to stay ahead, but the first gave off a strong unpleasant smell for several hours each time I tried it, so I tossed it and never tried the other two. These didn't have the black rubber backing like the original and hardware one. I think I'll look for ones with those and see if I have better luck..."
1,not an equivalent,the best air humidiwick ef2 mailed to me as a substitute for the essickmaf2 is shorter in size and doesn't fit properly into my humidifier.i am very dissapointed in amazon.i
3,It could have been better,"Plaid is a very interesting working musical unit. I have listened to these two disc several times and do not find anything distinctly different or unique on them, but it is Plaid. I am anxiously waiting for the bands next REAL album to follow up on their Awesome EP P-Brane. The remixes are okay, but I want more."
3,"Dissapointing, but worth a listen","I bought this CD with genuine hope it would be awesome, alas it wasnto to be. Being a big Plaid fan since my first purchase, 'Double Figure' - I was annoyed mainly at the inconsistency of the album. Sure theirs 20 tracks spanning over 2 discs, and dont get me wrong some of the tracks are very good, take the bjork remix for example. It just isnt upto standard with most of Plaid's other releases. So, altogether ther are a good few decent tracks on here, dont get me wrong, but when I buy an album, I would like to think i'd still be listening to it in a few months, and I honestly dont think I will be with this one - quality not quantity Plaid! p.s If you want a good remix album, '26 remixes for cash' by Aphex Twin is a lot better buy."
3,"Wuthering Heights, beautiful but boring","I found the flow of this book to be very nice. I thought that it was interesting how in some parts, it was a sotry inside a story inside a story. The wording was interesting and there were many nice lines. As with most classics,for me, it was hard to get involved with the story right away, but being a hopeless romantic, my interest was held when I realized that Catherine and Heathcliff were in love. After the whole bit between Heathcliff and Linton, after Catherine died, the story kind of went downhill. I was no longer interested in what happened. It was depressing because the theme that existed throughout was of falling in love, and then dying. It was very sad, but at least it was written well enough to touch my emotions. I like Emily Bronte's style of writing, but the plot wasn't quite what I anjoy reading."
3,Refunded,"I was given a full refund of the product because supplier could not get the materials I needed. Although it was last minute, they did give me a very quick refund and I had no further problems."
4,Another good read,Yep this was a good read too. Just wish that Kira wasn't so trusting especially after being burned once before. One would think that she would have learned after the first mistake.Also wasn't sure if we were supposed to like Lady Litchfield or not. She seemed a bit manipulative and was obviously more interested in another man yet she was trying to hook up Gavin and Kira towards the end even though she was one suggesting a relationship between Kira and her own brother.Aside from those things the book did hold my interest:)
4,Very Beautiful Artwork,"A little expensive, but it was a gift for my sister who loves angels & fairies. She was very pleased with all the designs. Card stock seemed nice quality & the metal box is a bonus. Very quick shipping, also!"
5,This book will make your mouth water and your belly growl,"This is a wonderful book about eating in the South, eating out and eating in, about a whole host of things like family and fellowship that gather around any groaning board in the south, and what you want to eat where and what the people who live there eat, how to cook it and where you're likely to find it at a reasonable price made by food-loving hands. John Egerton clearly ate his way across the south to write this book, and he was careful to stay well off the beaten path. It's anthropology, sociology, recipes, culture and good humor, from the North Carolina mountains to the swamps of Cajun country. This book will make your mouth water and your belly growl, but most of all it's a fine read."
3,St Benedict for the Laity: Good for all Christians,"This commentary is written from the perspective of a Presbyterian minister so it brings a different view of the Benedictine life from those written by Catholics and Anglicans who are more familiar with the Religious Life of Monasticism.Decidedly centered in Christ, the Rule of Benedict speaks well to those who seek a disciplined and structured life in the Spirit. Dean's book is focused on the parts of the Rule which can be adapted to life outside the monastery especially for Oblates and those Benedictine Communities that are experimenting with life outside the monastic walls. Dean is himself an Oblate of an ecumenical abbey and spends some time discussion his own journey to becoming and being an OblateSometimes a bit ponderous, this book is probably not the best for someone beginning to explore Benedictine Spirituality for their own life. For that, Norene Vest's devotional commentary Preferring Christ would probably be better."
3,Galileo's battle....,"This is a well made documentary and I enjoyed watching it. However, the actor who played Galileo I felt was somewhat miscast and the re-enacted scenes were a little overlong, but it is in my opinion still worth a look."
4,"Too Much Drama, Not enough Documentary","This follows the format that is used on many Nova programs of having a historic figure portrayed by an actor. It's a good program, very entertaining but it seemed to me that they spent too much time on the dramatic presentation and not quite enough on the science behind Galileo's work. I gave it four stars and feel that it is worth watching but if you are like me you will have seen plenty of Galileo's character by the end of the program."
4,Educating and interesting about the life and works of Galileo,"This is another good demonstration of how religious dogma has been trying to prevent scientific thought. For hundreds of years since Galieo this battle continued. It still continues in the 21st century around the world. For example, even today some religions in some countries are trying to prevent Charles Darwin's theory of evolution from being taught in schools.Anyway, this documentary about Galileo is a very good source for students doing research and preparing term papers about this great pioneer of science."
2,One Telling Too Many,"A Parisian Jewish lad is sent to the country during WWII, easily conceals his ethnicity, and returns home at war's end. Between his going and coming is a sequence of vignettes that become increasingly tiresome and meaningless. None of the characters gains anything in the way of wisdom, understanding, or wiles.Michel Simon is outstanding as the old man who gives the boy a temporary refuge, but Alain Cohen, as the youthful protagonist, appears to lack the ability to carry off the demands of his role. Or maybe the director intended his semi-autobiographical character to smile vapidly 90% of the time. Or maybe this English-speaking American reviewer just doesn't get it. Indeed, nearly every frame of this feature is full of subtitles, resulting in likely fatigue for a non-French-speaking viewer. There's nothing in the narrative to break the tedium, and thus the movie's 87 minutes seem much longer. In truth, not every story bears repeating."
5,My Dad was with the Army Signal Corps as it began and developed,"Interesting reading. Gave me an understanding of what he did, and the progression of the Army Signal Corps that has radically improved. Recommend!"
3,Depends on How You Want to Judge It,"Some people might find the stories in this book difficult to digest in terms of plot, but that does not diminish its literary value in terms of the writing. Gabriel Brownstein's writing style is unique and thoroughly enjoyable. He writes with a very sharp wit that the reader would find both humorous and thought-provoking.I was not completely taken in by the stories themselves, but I would be willing to read more of Brownstein's writings. Undoubtedly, he has a tremendous amount of talent, but it just was not displayed well in this book. In sum, there are better stories to be told than the ones in this book, but his writing makes the book worth a glance."
2,I could only take two stories with me.,"When I finished this collection, only two of the stories stayed with me. The title story, a man who lives his life in reverse, is an affecting and fascinating examination of an unreal situation presented realistically with all the pains and emotions that such an existence would have in the ""real"" world. ""A Penal Colony, All His Own 11E"" about visiting a friend, who is slowly slipping away into schizophrenia, also possesses an emotional resonance that hits with a force only the best short fiction can supply. The other stories tend to meander through a series of events that smack of pretense and lack the power of these two tales. A collection like this will always be a risk for the reader; the short story is limited to accomplishing its goals in a limited time. This collection was a little lacking in value for me, although when taken separately the two stories I enjoyed have merit, I can't wholeheartedly recommend this one."
2,it's okay,"This collection of stories is good if you're bored and don't have anything else to read (i.e. don't buy it, borrow it from a friend or the library). I wasn't incredibly impressed, and I'm not sure how this book was awarded the PEN/Hemingway award. It's good writing, but I didn't find it to be quite as incredible or inventive as some of the magazine reviewers did. It was okay."
1,The Curious Case of How This Book Got Published; Apt. Sucks!,"I was absolutely disgusted by the content of this mediocre, mundane attempt. I found the one story about the boy's older brother to be obscene and offensive. I have no problem with the provocative but this was just smut. I lost valuable brain cells reading this book. I am astounded by the fact that the reviews hailed this book as a Salingeresque masterpiece. I see no relationship whatsoever. If you notice the sales rank of this book, the only people who have read this novel were relatives of the author. I feel awful for those people. For the sake of humanity, I hope that he is never published again."
2,painful,"This cd has two part: the first one (tunes 1-5) is mediocre at best. It has one of my favorite piano players, hank jones, and what was he thinking? The first tune sounds like a hawaiian dance and I felt is was prisoner of the elevator from hell. All the songs with the strings (1-5) are a waste of energy. The strings don't swing, don't mesh with the rest of the band, and the vibrato really is painful.The 2nd part (6-11) redeems the cd. It is a competent quartet with Sonny and Hampton Hawes leading the rythm section. But by the time I got there, I was ready to toss the cd out the window anyway."
3,Informative but too general,"This book provides general information. If you need an overwiew of what alternatives are available this book is for you. It does not give detail on when in your cycle you are supposed to use which herb etc., which is what I was looking for."
1,"Some good info, some outdated info","Let me begin by saying that the first book anyone should read if they are trying to conceive is Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Wechsler. This book has some good information and recommendations. I tried to conceive for 2 years. I began taking evening primrose oil daily after reading this book. About 6 months later, I discovered the website tryingtoconceive.com and learned that evening primrose oil should only be taken prior to ovulation because it can cause uterine contractions and interfere with the implantation of an egg. After discontinuing the EPO from ovulation to menstruation, I conceived within 3 months. So, I guess you could say, had I NOT read this book, I may have been pregnant sooner."
1,Where is the proof?,This book is for people who do not have infertility issues. It does not address any real actions for people with proven infertility. It is a waste of time for the infertile reader.
1,I don't recomend this book,"This book is OK for someone who doesn't know her menstual cycle, has never monitored BBT or cervical mucus, has never tried ovulation predictor kit... I mean, WHO HAS NOT STARTED TRYING YET. Otherwise, you won't find anything new here.This book introduce many herbs to boost your fertility.But NATURAL doesn't mean harmless.Each herb is explained like ""estrogen promoting"" ""Progesteron promoting"" but it doesn't tell you WHEN of your cycle you should take it.Don't guinea-pig your fertility."
1,the big surprise,"I was reading along feeling that this might be an allright book and then whamo! the big surprise. We find out (and I'm not sure Connor ever did) that Sophie isn't a virgin. Had sex with a ""friend"" when she was younger. No big deal. Yes it was. She wouldn't have just done that in this time period. I felt like the author just couldn't have a virgin heroine, so she plunked down the friend story. It was so unbelieveable. It ruined the book for me right then. I just felt this book had no validity. I don't recall if she ever told Connor about this incident. This book just entered TSTL territory for me. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
5,True Highland Magic!,"This is a wonderful, wonderful book! A genuine Highland adventure, filled with magic and love. I see that Sarah Gabriel is a new author -- I can't wait for her next book, this was a real find. Take a chance like I did, you won't regret it!"
4,The cherry of this book is its well-thought out exercises,This is a well-written textbook for beginners in financial derivatives. It is very comprehensive as it covers various financial products. The main attraction of this book is its exercises. Many problems come from past academic papers. I benefit a lot from doing those drills.
2,Mathematical Models of Financial Derivatives,"The book is only a undergraduate textbook with no surprise. The author just tried to collect every method in linear pde and applied to finance area. Content is more or less same as Paul Wilmott's ""option pricing : mathematical models and computations""."
4,Excellent Resource Overall,"I bought this book to teach at my homeschool coop. Great resources and ideas are in it from Bible to science, literature and history. Activities focus mainly on the theology behind the story and the renaissance and reformation. The CD with printable discussion questions is great! My only complaints are there are no printables on the renaissance and reformation only the story itself and its discussion questions. There are web links (a few of which have expired) which help. I wish it had included the second Pilgrims Progress book Bunyan wrote as well. If you have younger students (2nd-5th grade), I would recommend having them read Little Pilgrims Progress (which is more their age level and contains the 2nd book) but still using this book for more interactive ideas. I am very pleased overall with this book. It has lots of great ideas and activities mentioned. It works great for a Bible study, homeschool coop or homeschool study."
3,Crossover,"This is an Anthrax attempt for a radio hit. That being said, it's a pretty good song with a great chorus. I'm sure that the rest of the album will be along the lines of hard, thrashing Anthrax."
4,"Content good, video quality not great.","If you grew up watching Tara, Kevin, etc, you will probably like this short video. Great to watch someone who pushed the sport forward to the level it is now. Wish video quality was better, but it was probably meant to be low-fi to give it old school feel. Worth the watch."
4,Funny Man! But Oy - What a Sad Childhood,"I really enjoyed this book, but it describes a very ""bittersweet"" life. Jackie overcame tremendous odds - an impoverished childhood, headed by an overbearing father who insisted that his son become only a Rabbi - and forget the comedy shtick. But Jackie couldn't; and even though he became a Rabbi, he soon cast that off to pursue what he was naturally good at - making people laugh. And there are plenty of laughs in this book. In particular, I praise him for standing by the sense of humor he developed and believed in; even when he was told too many times that he was ""too Jewish for the Gentiles"". He proved that everyone came to love his jokes, and to accept him. I give Jackie credit for having the Chutzpah to really let us into his life - even though some of it wasn't pretty. But - don't let me distress you too much - if you want to laugh: get this book!"
5,"Intriguing, Involved Fast Paced Murder Mystery","Having been raised on a bayou in Louisiana, gone to school in Lafayette and lived in New Orleans for 22 years I found Mr. Haynes book fascinating, imaginative and insightful of the darker side of Louisiana Politics, criminal aspects plus the goodness of Southern hospitality. The characters are from every aspect of life in Louisiana, from down home country people through the flamboyant Gallery owner to the bigots, criminals and every other group that populates the landscape.This is a great murder mystery with many twists and turns. The descriptions of the locations are wonderful with great details. I am looking forward to the next book with Adam Stephens."
1,a very disapointing book on the subject,"this book is not that promising as it seems .only a small part of the book is dedicated to natural health,- wich that section needs an improvement!"
4,Nice collection at a great price,"It's unusual to find a multi-movie package where they're all pretty decent. This is a nice-price collection consisting of four movies that are of ""drive-in theater"" quality. ""Sssssss"" (1972) is great (or not-so-great) if you don't like snakes. Stars the late Strother Martin. ""Serpent and the Rainbow"" is one of my personal favorites starring Bill Pullman. ""Phantasm II"" is the sequel to the first Phantasm classic, and again directed by Don Coscarelli. I'm not as familiar with ""The Fun House"" but at this price, how can you go wrong for horror thrills? Highly recommended."
4,Four scary movies at a reasonable price,"Four ""let's get scared in the dark movies"". Not bad at all. You will enjoy them if you like thrills and chills."
5,Phantasm II,"I bought this DVD to get Phantasm II. All the single versions of this movie were many times the cost of this compilation. I don't like the other movies on this disc and have not watched them except some time ago on TV during a Holloween marathon or some such nonsense like that, but I don't have moneys so I did it this way. I love the Phantasm series, weird stuff!cIaO!"
2,Ok -Not great,This book is okay but not great. Lots of images but there still leaves a lot to be desired in terms of the content and usefulnes. Probably won't buy another book from this series.
2,Get the manufacturer's manual,I bought this book so I could find identify which fuse goes in which socket and which fuse socket is for the headlights. This was a waste. It told me how to test to find out which one it was instead of the very detailed information for this car make model and year. It was too general.
3,Old Unreal Fan Switching to Macintosh,"At first, I had a problem with the CD key, and so I went to Mac Soft's Web site to figure it out. Apparently, my installer would quit after I entered the CD key and you have to download the updated version. They have a link for the download in their ""Support"" section.Even then, you still have to download a couple of patches for the online gaming, which in my opinion, is the only reason to purchase the game. The single Player Game Type is plain boring. The map editing on this game and being able to play your created map along with others online is what makes this unique from the other FPS games.Besides that, there is an article I have read about a study that tested 22 players and how their vision sensitivity has improved. The article specifically mentions Unreal Tournament 2004. Here is the link below:http://www.livescience.com/health/090329-game-vision.html"
5,Just buy it. Do not think twice.,"This is game is awesome. It works perfect in my Mac (Tiger 10.4.11). It has many players where you can choose. Nice arenas. My wife loves this game. So, if you are reading this comment, just buy this game. In a few words, you won't waste your money I can assure you that."
3,shakey,ok this shoes are like beautiful in the picture problem is that when I first got them I almost fell. That is the heel is quite high and hard to balance on. Also after just using it once to walk up and down the stairs little wrinkle looking lines form in the front of the shoe. Other than that they are cute and shiny!
4,Nice shoe for the price.,I really like the look of the shoe. My only regret is that they don't come in a size 12 Wide. But for the discounted price they are great!
3,travel use,"i tried using it prior to my travel to Grand canyon. My first time was good but i noticed my eyes started watering and stinging around 5-6 hours after. to make sure, i switched back to my old sunblock and my eyes were not irritated. I used the wipes again the following day and my eyes started watering again after 5-6 hours.. i never got the chance to use them though in grand canyon because i freakin left it my hotel room! LOL oh well.. convenient product though"
3,"It's great for travel, and it's not sticky but....","there isn't much sunscreen on the wipes. So if you are just at like a sporting event and need to cover your face and arms this is lovely! Very convenient, not sticky and doesn't sweat off like most sunscreens. However if you are going on a vacation where you will be spending a lot of time at the beach this product is kind of a hassle to take out 6 of those wipes to cover your whole body in one sitting."
4,Great When Ounces Count,I got these for my emergency kits and for camping. I could have easily bought a big bottle of sunscreen for next to nothing but when hiking every ounce makes a difference. These work great; weigh next to nothing and save you from sun burn or worse. I also keep these in my first aid kits and car and they have come in handy many times. They are pricy but when used for the right reasons the price is worth it.I recommend this to all.
5,Masterfully written,"Bay Tanner is a likable, struggling contemporary who gives herself fully to her work. Family relationships and solving crimes fill her life. The characters are real, the situations believable, the plot twists and turns with a surprising outcome. I am looking forward to following Bay into more cases and watching her relationship with her irritating, but sensitive brother-in-law develop. The overall glimpse into southern legend and colloquialisms of the Carolina Bay area adds spice to these adventure tales. Great writing, Ms Wall!"
1,Stereotypical Road to Nowhere,"I did NOT like this book at all. Talk about stereotypes up the wazoo. Bay comes from Southern charm, grace, money, and let us not forget the black Mammy!! Please, a drug lord named ""Hermano"" I am Hispanic, and found the book insulting and not well researched. The only thing I enjoyed was the description of the mansions. Believe me when I tell you that I wanted Bay Tanner to go away. Every man desires her!! Please, I should have read a comic book."
3,Lame,"Perhaps the problem is in the presentation. Stories like these are better told by a witty reporter than printed in a book. While many of the stories were entertaining, I felt like many of them fell flat. Some of the stories were mere coincidences that lacked humor. Others just did not seem to fit under the title of the book. An undercover cop suckering a drug dealer is only amusing so many times.I did gain some enjoyment from this book. Because many of the stories are based in the Chicago area, the proximity made that stories more relevant to me. Aside from these stories, I could have lived without this book."
3,Or four if you're into this sort of thing,"The title is promising and the concept is good for some laughs as we struggle to comprehend the mind of the not-so-crafty criminal. However, the same story with different variations repeated 100 times is about 84 times too many. Probably younger kids will have the unique attention span to find all of these funny but juveniles and older will find reading the whole book a bore. The writing style is also QUITE elementary. However, if you just want to veg out and not use any brain matter, this is perfect uninvolved reading for a lazy afternoon with Cheez-its (not necessarily a brand recommendation) and T.V."
4,This is funny,"America's Dumbest Criminals is a really funny book about people who commit crimes and do really stupid things to get out of their crimes. My favorite part was about a man who was convicted of robbing vending machines, he pleaded innocent, and posted bail entirely in quarters. I also like the ""Shortest Case"" the Judge asked how do you plea? the man stood up and said can I explain why I stole car?I would recommead this book to any one who finds others mishaps funny."
3,Not that funny,"The book: ADC is ok, nothing great. I have a VHS video of America's Dumbest Criminals which is hilarious, but the book is so-so. The stories are not that funny. It's not even written that good.My advice: look online for stories of America's Dumbest Criminals and purchase a video of the show if you can find one."
4,Hilarious!,I bought and read this book while I was at summer camp nad I couldn't put it down. I just couldn't believe how stupid some people can be. Everyone should get a chance to read this book so that they will know how truly stupid the human race is capable of being.
3,Ehh,"For some reason this burner takes about seven minutes when writing off the hard drive, and 20 minutes when copying from the CDROM drive. I have new Pentium 4 with a 50X cdrom drive, so I can't figure out why it is so slow. Tried 4 different software programs (the bundled burning software from HP is terrible by the way), different IDE chain combinations, and even different OSs to try to speed it up, but with no luck. Hmm. On the plus side though, its had a lot of use (about three hundred discs) with no problems or coaster-producing tendencies."
1,Bad product,"I bought the hp 8220e with the expectation it was a middle of the road, slow but effective cd burner. Unfortunately it was slow and ineffective. I was able to burn my first cd ok, but then went 1 for the next 15. I tried three types of blank media (memorex, memorex rw, and verbatim) then tried slower speed (2x) and keeping all other programs from running while burning (all of this on the advice of the helpful but ineffective hp customer service person which cost a $10 phone call). I downloaded the latest drivers and version of myHP CD and still no luck. For $200 bucks I could accept a few missed burns but this thing is a piece of junk. I found out the HP doesn't even make this thing- it's made by mitsumi and if I complained enough to customer service they might send me a hp-labeled Sony burner instead. I'll cut my losses and look elsewhere."
1,Piece of [junk]...,This is the worst CD writer i have ever used. The driver froze my OS( windows 2000). The service folk at HP blamed it on my dell laptop USB port.. However i bought a mitsumi cd writer and it was plug and play.. Don't even waste money on this. To sell it they have included some nice extras free which you can buy anyway for about $...
2,"good hardware, bad software","This is like other HP products, decent hardware but junk driversoftware. If you buy this drive, you will need to spend anothersixty-dollars ... to get a decentCD writer software because the one comes with the drive doesn't run under NT/2000 Server, doesn't make VCD/mixed CD, has almost nothing you can config, can't copy CD to image file, and doesn't even save the CD layout. I'm lucky that I had NTI CD Maker 2000 and I'm happy about the combination, but I just don't think it is right that HP puts a higher price tag on their products while providing you a software with a lot less features than the average."
1,Even more compatibility problems (2 different computers),"I was unable to get the unit working with EITHER of my two computers. After third call to tech support was informed that they are having intermittent problems with computers recognizing the unit. The 2 computers I tried to get working:Dell Inspiron 7500 Laptop with Windows 2000 ProfessionalDell Dimension 4100 PC with Windows MilleniumWhen I tried to install to my third computer, I realized the unit is not certified for use on Windows NT.Returned unit and will purchase different brand. Beware!!"
4,No Problems Here!,"I bought this burner to use with my IBM T20 laptop which is running Windows 2K. Not only was Windows able to recognize the device, but I also had to drivers installed in less then 5 minutes and had to burner working in 10 minutes. This is a great portable burner. I really love how easy it was to use with my desktop also (although that took a bit longer because of Windows 98). I recomend this product to anyone who needs a decently fast and portable CD Writer for use anywhere."
1,GARBAGE!!!,"This CD-RW drive is absolute garbage, and HP does very little to support any complaints. I've had the drive for just over a year and it just stops working. Well, first it was just inconsistent - it burned a cd or two, then wouldnt. I uninstalled and reinstalled HP RecordNow (in safe mode) about 6 times so it's been working sporadically. Now I've corresponded with tech support via email and after many long messages, they were not able to help me. So I called tech support for $25 and they again couldnt help me. They gave me a case number which now they say they can't find and they want me to try to resolve this issue via email - again.What kind of piece of machinery just stops working for no reason??? Don't waste your money because that's all you'd be doing by purchasing this... thing...."
4,Good Item for the price,"This is a good product for the price. Easy to install, however the software could be a little better for photos."
1,HP CD Writer,"A complete disaster. Worked well at first, then problems with buffer underuns, then more problems with destroying CDs."
2,BUFFER UNDERRUN,BOUGHT THIS PIECE OF CRAP LAST WEEK NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS.EVERY TIME I TRY TO BURN A CD IT EJECTS A ND SAYS BUFFER UNDERRUN.SPOKE TO SEVERAL TECH'S AND THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERANT ANSWERS AS TO THE PROBLEM. STILL NOT WORKING RIGHT.SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A INTERNAL DRIVE.LESS PROBLEMS.MOST OF THEM SAID TO GO WITH...
2,I spent too much for a rotten apple.,"Now I do not know to much about CD Rewritables (Burners), that is why I have my friends who know more about it help me out. The main problem is I cannot burn blank CD's, unless they are Hewlett Packard brand. That's right! I was able to burn 1 blank CD that was given with the CD-Writer. I bought a 50 pack of Memorex blank CD's & screwed up 7 of them. I even had my friends try to help & they couldn't do anything. It made me so mad & frustrated. It would always give me an error. But it works fine with the HP brand. My computer is not HP either, I don't know if that had any other affect, but I truly do not recommend this product."
2,"This item is ok, but could be better","I bought this burner back at Christmas time, and over the first few months I really enjoyed it and had no problems with it. I was up and running in less than 30 minutes!! But over time, for some reason it stop writing cds..I have tried all kinds of cds to use...and the strangest part of it is that I will burn 2 cds and then when I go to burn the 3rd one for some reason it comes up with a troubleshoot message saying ""cannot write to high speed disc"" but yet it did minutes earlier!! It plays music just fine through my cd player on my computer, for I have an HP Pavilion 6623 with Windows 98. I don't know what happened to it, but I've even cleaned the player and tried burning another cd and it still doesn't work. The other thing I hate about it is that it won't burn from wav format like most cd burners do..so I have decided to buy another burner. I would give this a 2 star but its not something I would reccommend to my friends."
4,"a little slow, but a good product","I originally bought the HP 9350i CD-RW, and it wouldn't fit. So I returned it and purchased the 8220e about three weeks ago, and I have used it several times. I had it unpacked, the software installed, and burning my first CD within 30 minutes. I am running an IBM Aptiva, Windows 98, 96mb RAM, AMD 400mhz, with a DVD player. Now the software that is included is really user friendly, but not much info or instructions with it. I had no problem installing it. The only problem I've incountered, is that my DVD won't work if the CD-RW is connected to the computer. This could be a software glitch, I don't know. So far I am pleased with the performance, it's a little slow, but I am just doing some music CD's and hard drive backup. A nice product for a novice burner."
1,Avoid this one!,"I bought one of these, and now regret my purchase. It worked fine for about six months, but now, despite my having followed all of HP's guidelines re. performance and maintenance, I'm lucky to be able to create a CD 20% of the time. The little green light on the unit flashes and flashes, then suddenly stops... the status bar reaches 98%... and just sits there. Time to reboot, throw out the CD and try again!"
4,HP Software 4 Dummies would of been Helpful!,"Had a few to many setbacks to get this to work properly on my IBM Think Pad, 300 MHz Pentium processor, with Windows 98.After many thoughts of throwing this burner out the window - I found out it's the HP Software that was causing me a lot of grief! The burner works GREAT!!The HP Software disc 1 cd, kept freezing up (3 little words Ctrl. Alt. Del.) I also needed to download the updated version of Record Now & Dla for the 8200e series on HP's website.Go to the Control Panel, Change the Power Schemes in Power management Properties set all to Never & Shutdown all running programs except Explorer & I must shutdown and reboot after a complete burn or the next burn will freeze up & walla a successful burn!I have now started using Nero software at Nero.com and bingo, no problemo. So guess what caused the missing star, out of a rating of 5 stars!"
1,Piece of Junk!!!!!!!,"Whatever you do, DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!! After only having this cd-burner for about six months, it just quit working. The software that comes with it is terrible. It constantly comes up with errors that make no sense. HP tech support is useless, so just take my advice. Buy anything else!!! You will be glad that you did!!!!!!"
1,Slowest,This device is like a piece of junk considering the speed and accuracy of its work. It never finishes a task correctly and it take about 30 minutes to write a CD.
2,An average product,"It's an average product. The software packages bundled with the burner are ok. I had to buy a better burning software. It's a usb product but doesn't work on macintosh. Though HP claims the burner dooesn't support Mac, it's still bit disappointing to know that it doesn't really work on mac. I'm saying this, because when ZipCD first came out, Iomega didn't have the driver and software for mac and yet it still worked on the platform. Even MS usb mouses without a driver works on mac. What really amazes me about HP is that customer representative never replies your email enquiries. BTW, HP delivers rebate checks really fast, and that's the only thing I like about HP."
2,not impressed!,"I ordered this item for .50 shipped so I do not feel like I was too badly ripped off. If I had paid full price, on the other hand, I would not be pleased. It is cheaply made and packaged and definitely not worth the money! I do not recommend spending any more than what I paid."
1,You get what you pay for!,"I only paid a penny for it, and only one side of the tester works on batteries. I'm sure it's just a defective unit, but not worth pursuing any further."
3,I bought two.,"* Dumb me. I thought I would get two meters for one shipping and handling charge. Nope. Paid twice.* They work, though. Awkward to use."
3,Works...but is pretty cheap plastic.,It works very well as long as you have the battery positioned appropriately. I love that I can figure out which of the 6 batteries in a toy is low on charge. The tester itself is pretty cheaply done - light plastic and I would think the arm could break off if you aren't careful. It definitely gets the job done and for the very low price I paid I am happy.
3,Good for the Money!,This is an easy to use tester. The test meter is not very clear (unless you use the color code). Other than that it's a great value.
2,Not Impressed either !!!!,"I also paid $.50 w/ free shipping. That's about all it's worth. It's a very cheaply made, poor quality gadget. It does test batteries to some degree. It's basically a ""yes"" or ""no"", if it has some juice or not. Not very accurate, but you get what you pay for."
1,Disappointed in Colorado,"Be forewarned. This book expresses very little original thought and is merely a collection of ""other peoples"" articles. This provides for very little logical flow for someone wanting to apply RUP. Where are the examples, tips of the trade, and how-to's?Shame on me for not having gone to the book store first to look at the book as the online description gives no indication that it was in a periodical format.I expected more from Scott after having read is other great ""original thought"" books."
3,Multiplication Songs,"I am a second grade teacher and use music to teach lots of skills. I was excited when I came across this book, but was disappointed when I received the book and CD. The songs were not very fun to listen to. I did get a couple of good game ideas from the book and there are pages of reproducibles."
5,A Great Read,"This plan really works. Dollar for dollar this was the best diet ever and best of all it is a lifestyle change. It is so simple to follow and easy on the wallet. I saved over $100 on food the first week alone. Reading these words has set me free. Jeff, you are my hero and an inspiration for the masses. How did you do it? Where did you come up with it? You have empowered me to see beyond the fat and face the truth. Everyone should be required to read this book....the truth is powerful."
5,"A revolutionary ""species"" of diet book!!!!","This is truley a brilliant dietYou are crazy if you don't try it.Jeff Speiss is such a sageThere is wisdom on every page!I lost weight and now you know itI've become the ""The Skinny Poet"".If you enjoyed this review, you will love the book ""Construction Poetry"" available right here on Amazon."
2,Tiny,"Make sure you look at the dimensions of this ""cookbook."" It's very tiny. Almost index card size. The recipes look okay, but are very common from what I've read so far. Not worth it, IMO, as a companion to an Aebleskiver pan (which is why I got it)."
2,Wanted more,Got better recipes for aebleskiver pancakes from a web search than in this book. I wasn't looking for other Danish recipes.
4,Small but nice,"The best way I could describe this is as a set of spiral bound recipe cards with a nice, glossy cover sheet. Even though it is small, I really like it. The paper and printing are very nice. I bought it primarily for the Ebelskiver recipes and there are a bunch of them so I'm happy. The spiral binding allows you to go to the recipe you want and have the whole thing lie nicely on the counter - unlike a traditional book binding which would always be slamming shut."
3,Aebleskiver and More..A sample of Danish Recipes,"This item arrived very quickly. The book was smaller than I thought. It has some good recipes in it but I was more interested in the baking of the danish ""pancake"" Aebleskiver's. I would still recommend this book. Thank you."
3,Cute Little Recipe Book,"The recipe book is a collection of a few recipes for Aebleskivers, maybe six. The rest of the booklet is full of other tempting Danish recipes that do not use the Aebleskivers pan at all. I was disappointed that it had so little recipes for Aebleskivers given it's title. But I do like that it is small enough to take with you, say, for camping."
5,"WONDERFUL, HEAVENLY, RELAXING, REVERENT",I LOVE LISTENING TO THIS CD. ESPECIALLY THE FIRST CUT WHICH IS THE 23RD PSALM. THIS IS ONE BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF MUSIC. ALSO I GAVE A COPY AS A GIFT AT THE HOLIDAYS.
2,Buy the furminator instead,We bought this and then found the furminator. Buy that instead. It works much better and our cats love it!
2,"Unit didn't work, but vendor took it back promptly.","This was a questionable unit to start with. I had to get some software from HP to try & set up unit on my HP. It was obsolete and nothing worked. But, the vendor was aware of the age, etc. and took it back for a full refund. I was only out $10 for the software....Unit bad, Vendor great!"
4,for insight into The Simpsons,"Simpsons Fans: must read.One of the main characters in Day of the Locust is Homer Simpson, who is described by other characters in the book as ""a big idiot."" This is the birth of Homer."
2,So dissapointed,"These books are loved. They're on all the top 100 lists. I had such high hopes, and didn't enjoy either one."
1,a new veiw,"miss lonley hearts is a truely tragic story centered around a depressed lunatic and his immoral and drunk freinds. he sets out to solve peoples problems and ends up only making them worse ruining his life as well as others. while the writers craft may be good, and there are many levels to this story, it is not one to contrive morals from."
3,Two/Too Depressing Books,I agree with the other reviewers that Mr. West was a talented writer.I keep trying to read these two books. I find them so depressing that I stop midway through each of them.I hate darkly comic books including these two.
4,Dark and compelling,"Bleak, dreary and sad, these tales nevertheless are well written and intriguing. Miss Lonelyhearts is a series of vignettes detailing a man's downward spiral driven by his job as an advice columnist. The Day of the Locust also provides sharply defined character studies that I found compelling."""
5,Underrated Early-20th Century Classic,"Either book is good enough to stand alone. I'd pay $10+ for either by themselves. But, put them together like New Directions did and you've got a helluva deal.West writes with a rare, humanistic rage. Like only a great writer can, he balances his anger at the world--at injustice, the degradation of modern morals, the death and lie of the American Dream/American exceptionalism--with his love and empathy for the tragic nature of individual human lives. West had a huge heart and a great sense of the pathetic undercurrent of life in 1930s Hollywood and Manhattan.Great books, great writer. Dead too young."
4,"Fun, Old Time Western","This is a review of the Prime Instant Video, which I watched for free as part of my Amazon Prime membership.The story itself is simplistic yet enjoyable, recommended for those who enjoy early Western films.The digitized film is in somewhat rough shape -- very watchable -- but not of high quality by a long shot. Besides much dust and film damage evident throughout, there are also at least three brief clips where a scene is doubled. It is obvious that no care was taken to review the film after it was digitized."
1,Useless,"It seems like they never tested these. It takes 4 or 5 to do my mouth as the floss stretches, shreds and breaks lose. Last night the plastic posts that hold up the floss broke most of the way inwards leaving plastic shards in my mouth! My housemate had two similar experiences. We haven't had such problems with with other brands, but the drug store never seems to have the same brands each time I visit!"
2,Poor Quality !,I usually don't write negative review but this floss is of really poor quality. I ended up with this product because I was trying to find the cheapest kind. These are so poor quality that you will end up using more than any other brands on single use which defeats the point of being cheap. Floss string easily breaks or gets loose when I try to reach tight corners of my teeth.Pros:Shredded Resistant FlossTexture PickTongue ScraperFresh Minty flavorEconomicalCons:Floss string easily breaksLower quality ( Enough to outweigh all the pros).I won't recommend this product. I hope the company reads these reviews and improve the quality of product.
4,fio dental,I'm from Brazil. I met when I Vicwood the U.S.. The product arrived in Brazil a few days.
5,Better than a simple Greatest Hits CD!!,"I hate ""greatest hits"" compilations, especially when I already own the original CDs. Live CDs, on the other hand, are something I look forward to with great anticipation. ""Incognito: Tokyo Live"" does not disappoint in the least.I thouroughly love every track. An added bonus is the inclusion of a great rendition of one of my top-3 Incognito songs, ""Always There"". Excellent! The arrangements depart from the originals in unusual, creative, and exciting ways. The only thing that would have made this CD better for me would be if it was a double-CD. Ah well, next time."
3,Not bad for a rental...,"A couple of friends and I rented some movies this past weekend, this being one of them. While I was skeptical at first about renting it, I soon found the movie to be entertaining. I won't bother with an overview of the plot, as others have covered that, but I will say that I found the movie to be well done, with the actors involved turning in solid performances. However, I would recommend renting this movie first before deciding to purchase it."
3,Solid effort,"First of all, I am not a fan of the Wicker Man, and would not compare it with this movie at all thematically. I was, however, struck by a previous poster's comparison to ""The Lottery"", which I hadn't considered, but does seem to fit.Rockwell Falls has an unusual method of population control, and a young census bureau employee is about to discover its secret. The journey is really part mystery and part melodrama, with a few supernatural chills thrown in for good measure. The picture does a nice job of setting up the storyline and characters without getting too bogged down in unnecessary side plots. There is little drama associated with the likely outcome of the movie from the outset, but the story is told quite well and the ending is satifying, if not predictable."
4,I liked this movie,"For it's over all wierdness and creative horror. The story was a different one for this genre. The story was a good one and the acting was good as well. I like B horror flicks so, I do recommend this movie to anyone that likes B horror flicks as well."
3,Pretty Good - Enough for me to buy it,"Though my first impression of this movie was that it was predictable and not very good...I am someone who watches movies over and over and the more I watched it the more it reminded me of Dark Secret of Harvest Home. It gave me the same ""icky"" feeling (which I love!) and I knew that I would want to see it again and again. I don't do lengthy reviews, just enough to give my opinion and while it is only a 3-star movie, in my opinion, it is worth a look. The acting is good, there is some predictability but the ending might give you a thought or two. I thought the plot concept was interesting and made me wonder how these writers come up with these new and interesting concepts."
4,Glad I picked it up,"I had never heard of this movie, but I read the box and it looked like it had possibilities so I took a chance. I was pleasantly surprised. It was pretty good. I couldn't decide on the stars though. It's really not a 4 star movie, but is better than a 3. I went with the 4 because it was better than I expected. The plot has been done before and the ending was predictable, but the film was pretty suspenseful. Had to love Bobby. Anyway, this film is worth a look. Not the greatest film but not a waste of time either."
3,Direct-to-DVD Surprise!,"I didn't expect much when the movie started, but I thought since Jeremy Sisto was in it, and the fact that I had seen some of his other movies, and believe he's a decent actor, I figured Population 436 couldn't be all that bad. And you know what? It wasn't. It played out like a typical Stephen King miniseries. It wasn't heavy on the violence and CGI, which is a good thing because sometimes you just want the script and the actors to carry the movie forward like they're supposed to.It held my interest that I wanted to see it through to the end. I know that's not saying much but I do believe Population 436 is worth a viewing."
4,"""Wicker Man"" Meets ""The Stepford Wives""","Jeremy Sisto is an engaging actor who carries this film. His character's plight--trying to document a small town's population for the U.S. census. Things get stranger and stranger as he tries to mount what should be an easy task. And the townspeople are evasive and unhelpful. Cleverly directed and shot in a scenic community with a secret, Population 436 serves as a nice diversion with a twist ending. Light on scares, but it manages to successfully keep you guessing as to why Rockwell Falls population never changes..."
4,"Great Product, Great Price",Bought for my son who's in beginner band class...he loves it! Received trumpet in under three weeks. I definitely recommend Yamahaian.Only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars is because there was a dent on the 2nd valve slide that I thought should have been caught by their quality control. Yamahaian quickly made it right- great customer service.
5,can you say air guitar???,this album is amazing. its non stop air guitar playing . its hard to not want to play air guitar. the riffs are sweet country metal type and the solos are just fantastic. its good to know people out there still support this great band. MOTORHEAD ROCKS!!
5,Power motor,"In my opinion this is the best of all motorhead cd's. The tunes are catchy fast and furious. The production is good and their is some melody in this fast moving music. I like motorhead's earlier out put more than they're later stuff. The original line up was awesome with fast Eddie Clark at the guitar. Too bad he left the band after Iron Fist, which by the way is also a cd that I recommend. After iron fist I lost interest. Orgasmatron is a bomb, post fast Eddie Clark, just awful. So don't wast your money. About the rest of motorhead's output all I can say is that comparing they're earlier music to they're later music, all and I mean all the music without fast Eddie is just mediocre. Its only for die hard motorhead fans. Unfortunatly I wasted some money on they're later material hoping to find that same sound from the early music, forget it, its not there, its not the same.Motorhead's best cd'sAce of spadesIron FistOverkillBomber"
5,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent","Despite the fact that I don't like Iron Maiden or Judas Priest, I love Motorhead. They give a speed and power that isn't heard in any of the other music. Bassist Lemmy has a talent like no other before or after him. The speed of songs like ""Ace of Spades"" combine gritty rock n roll with punk and thrash to make a completely enjoyable experience. The guitars are a great pressence on this album. The drums fly with a speed and hit with perfect timing that is mindblowing to most drummers. Lemmy's voice gives a bassy and gutter sound comparable with Metallica and other metal bands.I suggest this album to any metal fan who does not own it. I also suggest it to punks who would like to open their mind to other types of music. It helped me and I listen to metal like a second language. This album is amazing and not many other albums compare."
4,100% testosterone filled fury,"Not known for their ballads, motorhead was probably the heaviest heavy metal band in the early 80's. Just one big, loud, anoying smash in the face to the music industry, Ace of Spades hit and keeps on hitting with the title track, ""The Chase is Better than the Catch"", and ""Jailbait"". Lemmy once said ""if it's fast, loud, and anoys your parents. Then its good"". Don't let your parents get a hold of theis one or they might burn it."
5,I don't want to live forever!!,"Other reviews have analyzed the songs and this album so I shall not tread there: Simply Imagine yourself sitting in your living room, you are startled by the fact that your door has been kicked down by a huge biker looking guy with the most awesome handlebar stache you have ever witnessed. He says nothing, he simply hurls you to the floor and proceeds to grind your face into the carpet, and as you you feel your skull collapse under the weight of a steel toed boot, your last thoughts are: ""THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!"" that is what listening to this album is like."
5,Classic,One of the finer Motorhead records of all time and quite enjoyable. Get ya one. Lemmy at his finest and the bit with OzMan in it is cool too.
5,minden id'k legjobb rock albuma,"A Motörhead ezzel a lemezével a metálzene egyik legjobb albumát készítette el. Kemény, hibátlan, eredeti. Nem maradhat ki egy rockrajongó zenetárából sem."
5,"If you only got one Motorhead CD, make it this one","This is the best quality Motorhead CD I have heard, and it is in my opinion better than the Overkill CD (supposed to be the best they did).The Ace of Spades album rocks, and if you dont like this one, you will not likely like Moterhead. This album also is one of the series that Eddie Clark plays on. To me, he was the driving sound of Motorhead, and when they were a classic trio, he was the guitar player.You cant go wrong with this one!"
4,An excellent study,This book was one of three chosen as textbooks by my professor for our Matthew class. It offers insightful exegesis by a noted Biblical scholar.
3,Check out Charleston Style!,"Despite author Susan Sully's grammatical errors, misspellings (""sheathes of wheat"" instead of sheaves of wheat -- why, oh, why don't editors catch those anymore?), labored metaphors, and use of cliche' (""dripping with spanish moss""), I loved this book. Josephine Humphreys writes a beautiful and moving foreward. The photos (by John Blais) are literally breath-taking (to borrow another cliche'). Imperative reading for the student of architecture or design, or for those simply enamored of regional style."
4,GOOD COLLECTION,"I have been a Hardcore fan of Faith no more for about 11 years now and I've never heard ""The Cowboy Song"" before so I got this and it was worth the money just for that song alone, Definetly one of the best FNM songs I've ever heard. and the live version of ""As the worm turns"" with Mike Patton on vocals is great, its good that they included songs off of ""We care a lot"" as well (Arabian disco), and I'm glad they included ""Annes song"" because that is one of my favs from the Chuck Mosley era, and its got ""Perfect crime"" which is a great song. other than that its pretty standard greatest hits album, I wouldn't say that its better than ""Who cares a lot"" greatest hits, they both have their pluses.The reason I give this one only 4 stars is because they should have included ""Ricochet"" and ""Stripsearch"". than it would have been perfect. but like I said, its worth it for ""The Cowboy song"" alone."
3,Market flood?,"A band with as many interested fans as Faith No More is not served well by a compilation of tracks that can easily be found on other discs that generally have other material around them that is at least equal in quality. What Faith No More fans deserve is a compilation that brings all those hard-to-get B-sides in the one place. You know the ones I am talking about. The rerecorded version of As The Worm Turns, Das Schutzenfest, a cover of Let's Lynch The Landlord, and so forth. Those are the tracks that I would pay to own in compilation form. This is at least the third time I have seen Liberation barf out a compilation of tracks I mostly already have on other compact discs, while my requests for easier access to the hard-to-find tracks that people trade on Kazaa are still going begging. My recommendation to anyone new to this band is to avoid these compilations and buy the albums. Your long-term satisfaction will be greater."
3,this is it,"save your cash,fnm are one of the best bands ever but compilation albums don`t give you a full picture.instead of this cd,get angeldust,king for a day and album of the year.these are true examples of fnm,punk,funk,rap and metal combined together to make great music,"
1,"Zizanie, but not 'de Fragonard'","I remember this cologne from the 1960's when Zizanie de Fragonard was much too 'mature' for me, and quite expensive. I got suspicious when I saw the price of the current product, which was about the same dollar amount as I paid 40 years ago, but I ordered it anyway. This is obviously not the same cologne. Note that it's called 'Zizanie', but 'de Fragonard' is not mentioned. In fact, no manufacturer or country of origin is on the bottle (just that the essences came from France), and the product isn't listed on the House of Fragonard web site. That said, it does smell like an inexpensive copy of the original, but even after 40 years, I can tell it's not the same. Tant pis!"
3,Fragrance From the Past,I had remembered this cologne from a very long time ago and wanted to see if I still liked it. It was okay but not the knock-out fragrance that I had remembered and loved so well.
3,GBA Bumper,This is handy to have if your child is like mine. Butter fingers. Helps to protect game when banged or dropped.
3,Good Writer - Poor Bundle,"Out of the box, the install was flawless (However, I have done this before). The HP software (light version, with typical come-on) worked very well. The drive is fast! The Adaptec driver leaves much to be desired as it bombs with a Fatal Exception Error (""Blue Screen"") when trying to write using DirectCD instead of the MyHP CD Creator. Using the Windows Media Player, File - Create CD"" option, the Adaptec Direct CD program is started, and all goes well as it converts the files for recording. When it goes to write, Bill's favorite ""Blue Screen"" appears, the program is terminated, and the disk cannot be ejected or the drive used unitl the system is re-booted. (emphasis on the boo!) HP's response for tech. assistance was no help. Adaptech will not take any responsibility. Pretty typical OEM buck passing. Updating to latest drivers and software does not clear the problem either."
1,Difficult Installation Experience,"I had a very different experience than many of the other reviewers. Installation was very difficult on a standard Windows 98 Gateway computer. The technical support line (free support) kept disconnecting me. I finally reached HP through their out-of-warranty #. Bottom line, even though I was replacing an existing CD-ROM (which should have been a 10 minute exercise as others have commented), I had to make numerous jumper changes, changes to the systems bios and had to reinstall other devices after the initial installation caused my machine to refuse to boot. I spent a total of 2 hours on the phone working directly with HP tech support (who were really trying to help) and at least another hour on hold when I was disconnected, trying to get back through. At one point, the Tech Support person acknowledged that this was ""a new product and may still have some bugs in it."" My recommendation -- proceed with caution and choose a product with a little longer history."
1,not what I expected,"I enjoyed Dog's Eye View's first and second discs as well as Propeller, Peter Stuart's solo. This current cd is way over-produced with a lot of electronica and syn-music. Not what I expected, esp. given the acoustic/straightforward rock/pop on the first two discs. I was anxiously awaiting the release of this latest disc, but I'm very disappointed. Also, I saw Peter Stuart solo at a small club and he was not very good. I would have preferred him with a band."
4,"Good CD, but not their best.","If you're a Dog's Eye View fan, a must buy. If you've never heard them before I'd say still buy, but be sure to also buy their debut album, with hit ""Small Wonder."" That album made me a fan."
4,Editorial Review is Incorrect,"The Editorial Review (above) is incorrect. Model 4160 does not have an automatic setting. If you are interested in that feature, you'll need to upgrade to model 4161. Since the unit is noisy on the higher settings, I would recommend rarely using anything other than the Whisper (somewhat of an exageration) setting anyway. It's built well though, and seems to work."
4,Does the job!,"I'd had sinus problems for many years,which had been getting into my lungsrecently. No relief from anythingelse, but this air cleaner finally didthe job. Presumably the infection wasfrom mold or fungus, so with all themold removed from the air, my bodywas finally able to clear itself.What a relief!!!Agree with other commenters that it'smoderately noisy, but it's a calmingkind of noise, good for background.Also agree that the control knob isa very bad design, impossible to grip.I wrapped it with many layersof duct tape to make it usable."
4,Great stuff from Bobby Timmons,Im a big fan of Bobby Timmons and therefore a certain amount bias probably creeps into my opinion of his work however I can honestly say that this set is of a high standard and a hell of a lot of fun to listen to. It combines two previously out of print LP's and plays for a solid 70 minutes. Fans of straight-ahead jazz/soul-jazz/blues will definitely find something to like on this disc. He may have worked the blues scale almost to death over his recorded output however this represents a variety of material which is well worth the purchase price. I hope you enjoy the music of this underrated artist as much as I have and will do for some time to come!
3,Synthesizer bugged me,"I want to buy a CD of Neapolitan songs as a gift. I listened to several artists' recordings on Rhapsody. I must say, I loved the singing on Ronald Naldi's albums the best. He has a rich, warm, open style.But I listen for the accompaniment, too. As I listened carefully, I kept thinking, Is this a synthesizer? The previous reviewer confirmed my suspicions. I will buy a CD by another artist...and hope that someday Mr. Naldi or his producers can afford to do it right with human musicians!"
1,fell apart in a month,I put this replacement pad on my car a month ago and the rubber is already falling apart. It is splitting from use. It is a piece of junk.
4,True back,"I love It!! Light, portable and it really works. My lower back pain has lessened since using True Back. I use it twice daily when I can and feel instant relief once I have finished. Took me a while to be able to comfortably use the "" high"" end of the True Back but bit by bit it is getting easier and I feel great afterwards. Well worth having in the home if you suffer from back pain."
1,in completed item was mail and never respond to my request since !!!,"First item was mailed to wrong address and has returned to sender.Second item arrived but missing vibration and comfort pillow, I wrote a letter to CS requesting the missing items to be mailed since August 2012 but it never arrived.Honestly I won't able to comments or write the full review due to incomplete items and the Trueback just became one of my unwanted item/ collection at home.I don't think to shop or recommending anyone to purchase from the 'amazon.com' with my bitter experiences."
5,El mejor disco de Ricardo Arjona,"Este es para mi el mejor disco de este gran poeta, es una mezcla perfecta de rima y ritmo bien logrado. Además con una excelente ltra de te hace meditar, como es el caso de La Nena que es una de las mejores canciones o la reflexión sobre el tiempo en Minutos, realmente es una gran prodocción discográfica que no le puede faltar a nadie porque es la mejor. Además el VCD que trae es muy entretenido, se siente como estar con él en uno de sus conciertos. Además de este disco debes adquirir Lados B, con grandes éxitos para mi de el mejor cantautor del mundo: Ricardo Arjona."
1,Arjona...explotando la ignorancia humana,"Arjona es un tipo listo. No muy talentoso...pero listo...y con la suerte de conocer dos o tres cosas sobre la mediocridad.Arjona no tiene nada de poeta...nada de artista...nada de novedoso...lo que pasa es que como la mayoria de la gente no tiene muy clara la diferencia entre poesia y estupideces...toman sus canciones como verdaderos cantos inspirados de gran profundidad. No hay nada de profundo en Arjona. Lo suyo es poesia de supermercado..de la facil....de la simplista. Fito Paez es un poeta, Silvio Rodriguez es un poeta.....Arjona esta disfrazadon de poeta..pero en realidad esta a solo un paso de ser un simple musico pop mas que se aprovecha de la falta de lectura que plaga nuestros paises."
2,Arjona lo peor....... de la cancion en español,"Yo no se que le pasa a este tipo, todas sus canciones aburren y carecen de inspiracion,y esta review no es solo a este disco sino a todos los que ha hecho, quieren escuchar a un buen cantautor con buenas historias que contar JOAQUIN SABINA, ese si es un tipo con talento que sabe escribir, cantar no, pero escribir, si que escribe muy buenas letras, en fin que arjona siga en lo suyo, perdiendo su tiempo y haciendole perder el tiempo a los demás."
3,Mas de lo mismo,"Definitivamente Arjona nos vuelve a reptir lo mismo de sus ultimos discos, las letras son muy parecidas a otras que ya ha escrito antes, y es una estupidez quien dice que esto es poesía, porque definitivamente no lo es, algunas letras son divertidas y algunas son atinadas, eso es todo. De las 14 canciones que incluye el disco, a mi gusto solo son dignas de mencionarse, El Problema, Dame, Minutos y Vivir Sin Ti Es Posible."
4,Arjona Delivers,"As always Ricardo Arjona delivers excellent music for the ""bohemios"" of the world. It's a totally complete collection of beautiful songs with and edgy rock rhythm and an orchestra. It'd definitely Ricardo ARJONA at his best!!"
2,The post is actually 25 mm not 25.4 mm diameter,"This post was a replacement for a 1 inch diameter post, and I had to shim it out with two pieces of aluminum flashing to make the diameter large enough to be tightened in the bicycle."
4,A very memorable book,"I read this book almost twenty years ago and the story is so vividly written, that I recall most of the story to this day. The story is of a young woman who experienced the San Francisco earthquake and the resulting fires that further devastated the city. I remember thinking that I could almost smell the smoke that choked the city. I did love the story and would certainly recommend the book."
5,Becoming Barack: Evolution of a Leader review,This is a great story about the details of Obama's political background in the 80's and 90's.Becoming Barack: Evolution of a Leader
1,Can't use it,"I bought many products from this company and was very disappointed to see the ingredients list.All of them have magnesium stearate which it presents health risks such as immune suppression, toxicity, ingestion of trans fats and exposure to carcinogens.It can actually weaken your immune system.I won't use them."
3,product review,"Sometimes this product works for me, while other times it just doesn't do the trick.I usually need 2 or 3 doses."
3,"It's OK- not as good as their album ""One Nation Under God""","If you want to hear some of Tragedy Ann's good stuff, check out their other album:One Nation Under God"
4,"Good, not great resource","If you are looking for a job in a specific city, a job bank book is a great way to get started. If you do not currently live in that city and have easy access to their local resources, it is especially valuable. It is a great way to start identifying companies and job search resources in that region. Comapnies are listed by industry and size. Some companies even have HR contacts listed.But don't expect huge job search boosts from this--the job searching techniques section is not particularly good. As in any successful job search, you still have to pound the pavement to discover the best opportunities."
3,Not So Great.,"This book does not have a great description of anything, really. It touches on many typical problems but does not fully explain much beyond the obvious. I think if it was not easy to photograph and explain the authors just skipped it."
5,Love that Lucy,Season 4 is another great season of Here's Lucy and I can't wait to get it since my stores don't have it so I have to order it offline but as long as I can get it I don't care. (besides it's cheaper to get online than at a store).
5,Wonderfully inspiring!,"In this book, Paul McCartney proves that he is not only an immensley talented musician, but a painter as well. His paintings are unique; he has a style all of his own. I am so glad he had his paintings published for all of his fans to enjoy, they are truly remarkable, as he is."
1,Weak,"I'm a Beatles freak, and fan of McCartney through them, and I tried to see some merit in these paintings. But they bite. McCartney does not have artistic talent. A celebrity painting makes one groan anyway. But I had to admit after viewing Anthony Quinn's paintings and Tony Bennett's paintings, that they were actually quite good. (Even Tony Curtis's paintings aren't bad, in a hotel-room-art kind of way.) McCartney doesn't have it. And the interview with McCartney in front of the book is pretty bland. So the book isn't even worth getting for that. Of all the talented artists alive now who will die unknown, and here's an untalented artist getting national exposure. Oh, well, that's art and commerce in the age of celebrity. McCartney is a talented MUSICAL artist, of course, and should not have strayed from that."
5,"9 stars !!! Totally Bizarre, different, great, original","This is a simple review. I love all forms of music, but these guys are simply too original. I tend to stear mostly towards more progressive titles, but these guys simply rock. No noise, simply unconventional writing and playing that never ceases to captivate. I don't even know how to classify it.... progressive rock-metal-jazz-fusion-grunge-progressive-new wave-techno-acoustic....Listen to All Too Real, then you'll get it"
2,"heavy, awkward, and breakable",Well the first time the toy dropped the piece holding the eyes in place broke off. It is very heavy so my 4 1/2 month old can't even shake it. Even when I shake it there isn't much in the way of a fun noise and so it's just another in the heap of useless toys. I was very disappointed - I expected more from a Melissa and Doug toy.
2,Not for me!,"There should have been a notation in the description that this is a very Catholic book, and as I am not, I gave it to a Catholic friend of mine. Hopefully she enjoys it."
1,BE WARNED,"I purchased this to replace the filter on my 04163 unit and although the description (and box) say it is compatible with this unit, it was the wrong size! I still don't know how to order the correct one."
5,Fits perfectly as always!,Hamilton Beach continues to produce great filters in support of their products even if they are over 15 years old!!
1,avoid this company,"They take your money and do not deliver product. Google ""Light Impressions"" problems and you will see what I mean."
3,Very strong,"Stronger than I needed and would cause some bags and purses to become damaged, I think. I bought them to fill a ""free shipping"" order. I will find a good use for them though, I'm sure."
3,Has potential,"Works but not for long. The ends broke off in the purse and the thing fell off. The magnet is strong and it was great until it broke. I might have installed it wrong, I will try again."
3,Not for big dogs..,"It works decently - I bought one to use on my husky puppy because her coat isn't thick enough for my other brushes yet. It strips off the fur that she's shedding, but definitely isn't heavy-duty enough for a thick coat or larger dog."
5,More fun reading,"Firefox, if you have never read any of their books, provide a wonderful read aboutold time processes of living and include some charming, family stories as well."
3,Americana Romanum,"Readers should understand the correlation between Roman history of empire and America's. One reviewers skin is a little too thin if they turn a book review into a paregoric about the writers' failure and forget to see the truth in Vidal's message amidst the honeyed vitriol. Vidal IS our only Suetonious, our only Tiriesias. I think we can indulge the man- forget the disgruntled reviewers' puritanical false rectitude which passes for discourse. Instead, enjoy the incisive wit a la Twain that Vidal brings to a subject larded with the detritus of America's lust for self righteousness."
5,a great little book,"this book is small--truly pocket-sized and also cheap.for its size and cost, it is truly a great starter for anyone just starting out with mobile development."
4,"Get Mad, It's Out-Of-Print","For years I've enjoyed Thad Jones' albums on Blue Note so when I saw some of his OJC CDs in the cut-out bin a few years ago, I snapped those up too. ""Mad Thad"" was orignally released on the Period label, part of the Everest Record Group, in the late 1950s. Much like the amusingThe Jones Boys(see my review), which was also the brainchild of critic/producer Leonard Feather, a whole bunch of Joneses drop by to lend Thad a hand, including Jimmy, Eddie, Jo, Quincy and brother Elvin. But we also get contributions from Franks Foster and Wess, Doug Watkins, Henry Coker and Tommy Flanagan. The highlights are an early version of the Thad-penned standard ""Bird Song"" and the CD bonus track ""Ballad Medley,"" which was Thad's portion of an old split 10"" with Sonny Rollins. But with this title now OOP, don't get mad about having to pay collector's prices for ""Mad Thad."""
2,Don't smell like real pine,"It's more like cleaning fragrance.If you burn, it evaporate so fast.Don't smell like a real pine.Et eg"
4,Ths is a good deal,Da Bird is great cat toy and this is a good way to buy it - very good value.Love the peacock feather too - nice surprise.
2,Great until the string fell apart,"Both cats adored the toy, but within a week the string connecting the feathers was completely disintegrated. If the cats bit on where the feathers attached to the string, it would basically snap off. Maybe the string is old or bad quality? So now I'm left with a pole and a couple of toys that are essentially useless.Sure I can ship it back, but of course I already threw away the 3 foot box it came in. I guess I'll have to find some higher quality string to use instead. The toys that it came with were decent quality, but were getting shabby before the string snapped for good. However, I wouldn't consider them great considering their previous wand toy lasted over 4 years."
5,BEST CAT TOY EVER!!!!,This cat toy is the BEST TOY EVER!!!! My cat loves her toy just wished I could of found it sooner for her!!! You know it's a GREAT TOY when Jackson Gallexy uses it on his show My Cat From Hell!!!!! Was really hard to find in pet stores. To bad cause every pet store should have this on their selves!!!! A must have toy for your cat!!!!!
3,Fun but not sturdy,I have now bought 2 of these poles. First I bought the whole package but my cat tore through the string. I bought a replacement handle with a wire string by the same company at a local pet store. The piece holding the wire onto the handle pulled off. I've glued it back on but I can't let them catch it and pull any more. It just comes apart. Very disappointing since the kittens were having such fun.
5,Beyond a hit!,"As soon as we unpackaged it our cat was all over the feather attachment and became infatuated with it. He could not stop playing with it, despite exhaustion. The feather attachment worked great and simulated a bird flying amazingly, have yet to try the other attachments but im sure they will inspire great play. The rod is really long with a good length string so it is easy to get the cat moving and jumping like crazy. You may tire of this toy before your cat does!! even when put away our cat continues to look for it and ask to play with it"
5,Da Bird is Da Bomb!,"The shipment arrived on time and intact. I liked the fact that the pole included in this super pack was one piece, as opposed to the two-piece poles you would normally get at the pet stores. The feathers are great and my cats also like the puffy toy attachment as well. I haven't tried the sparkle attachment yet, but I am sure it will be a hit as well. It can be difficult to find toys that keep the interest of my bengal cats, but this one is definitely a favorite. This is an AWSOME toy - a must-have for cat owners."
4,Pleasant new Brazilian electronica,"Modern electronic remix tracks, with samples drawn from ethomusical percussion albums, the afro-samba band Ile Aiye, old ""cinema novo"" art films, and from field recordings made in towns inside Brazil's Mato Grosso and in rural Argentina. The mixing and production concepts seem somewhat unidimensional, but it's still very nice, and the choices of source material are pretty creative... There's a Sergio Ricardo credited on one track, presumably the old 1960s bossa nova pioneer; yet another reason to check this disc out."
4,A must for all women,"I think this book should be required reading for all young women.Beware, through this book I started believing again."
5,Great book,"I'm a fan of this author, she is insightful, knowledgeable about the subject matter, and her facts and research are impeccable."
3,No Light!,I am SO disappointed! I just returned from Target with the last Hamilton Beach HEPA UV Air Purifier they had (had to drive to 3 stores to get it too!) Unpacked it and the UV light does not work! Grrrr...I hope it's only the bulb and not the starter too. I've been all over town today looking for one of these and Target was the only store that had ONE.
2,Seems like a great filter but too costly and not sure it works,Beware that the cost of the refill filter is $50.00. You could buy another filter for that. I bough 3 of these filters after developing severe sensitivity to pollen and mold and had it in a room at work that turned out to have toxic mold in the air. I had the filter running at slot to high 24 HRS a day and I don't think it killed any mold. I developed a severe allergic reaction to the mold even with the filter running all the time. Then I found out that it costs 50 dollars to get a new filter at a discount place. I am throwing the filter out and keeping my old ones that I think work better.
2,it lasted about 2 months,you think if you pay top dollar you get top quality right? i bought 2 of these units for my condo. one of them is dead after about 2 months of use. what a waste. the retailer where i bought the unit... stopped carrying them and the filters. now i have no where to buy filter replacements except at some online rip off outlets. i was happy with the unit before it died.
4,I'm so glad I read the reviews and bought this filter,"My husband's snoring had increased to the point that I was sleeping on the couch every night. My nose was so stuffed every night that I was taking allergy pills. I read the reveiws on this filter and felt it was worth a try. Miracles!!! My husbands snoring is reduced to almost nothing, I've been sleeping in our bed every night, haven't taken allergy pills since I hooked it up. Wish I could leave it on automatic, but I find that it does get loud at night -- but the sleeping level creates just the right amount of ""white noise"". Thanks to all you other reviewers who took the time to fill it out! Hope it works as well for you!"
4,Quite-works good,auto setting works great-when I fold clothes it kicks way up. keeps the air virtually dust free.
3,Too noisy for my taste,This product works fine to clean the air in my small work room. The quick clean feature is particularly nice to clear something immediately. I gave it three stars mostly because the fan is too noisy on the lowest setting.
5,Happily surprised,"I an happily surprised with the quality of this product. I have used it for several weeks and find that I am sleeping comfortably through the night. Prior to having the Hamilton TrueAir Air Purifier, I awoke every night with a blocked head and dry mouth. This does not happen anymore.The TrueAir is small and quiet. I do not even hear it during the night. I have noticed that if I am in the room cleaning or moving things around, the machine starts to work hard, then quiets down.This machine is a good deal and well worth the moderate price."
4,3 years user of the Hamilton Beach 04161,"I just want to say that after three years using this device I reduce my colds in about 50% so I only get sick maybe one or two times a year after I purchase it, because in the night when we sleep is when we are more vunerable, after using this model I reduce all my complication, the only issue is when the hepa filter start to fill with dust, is not a silent device anymore, so It will depends how dry is the weather in your Area."
2,Not as promising as it looks,"Baught this air purifier hoping to have quite nights with clean air. Well, the first part is definately not part of the equation when it gets to this unit. It is VERY noisy and we ended up stop using it. I do not know if the problem was with the specific unit that I recieved or with the product in general, but it is something that you should take under consideration."
2,Short life cycle,"The unit is noisy at highest speed, but it creates a nice breeze and really collects dust. But the motor konked out after just 4 months. Avoid!"
3,very difficult book-both literally and subjectively,"This author is very intelligent. So much so that she isolates very good percentage of her potential readers because of her level of thought. Once into the book, it gets better, and the subject matter is very provocative. Unless you are ready to handle some very heavy reading, I would let this one pass."
1,Ridiculous Customer Service,"I purchased this drive in large part because of a rebate HP was offering at the time. (Don't worry the drive costs less now without a rebate.)HP expired the rebate just one month after the last eligible purchase date. I called them and the just said 'that's just the way it goes.'I know other companies use rebates as a gimmick to get a quick buck, but until now I have expected more from HP."
5,A Must Read,"Martin and Odell - an experienced team demonstrates object oriented concepts to the theoretically educated audience.Without the enlightning read of 'The OO Foundation' (Martin, Odell) the buyer might encounter difficulties to follow the discussions.As the title clearly states, the authors discuss the applications, mostly pragmatic, of oo concepts and methods. This includes the realization of oo concepts in programming languages, their limitations, best practices.The book is structured as a cook-book with powerfull how-tos not only for the application design but also for tasks of a software development process.Please note that this book does not define any methods nor does it specify a software development process. It gives you a pragmatic view based on the rich experience of the authors - even today, six years after the book was first published.A must read for every serious software developer."
2,difficult to rate,This book is far to difficult in explaining basic OO-terminology. Not a good choice to learn OO. I never could encourage myself to read it completely. So far it mainly serves as reference to other books. It has rather good reference lists after each chapter.
5,This is probably my favorite Immolation cd...,"At first, i didn't really like but a couple of songs on here. This is what happens to me on the first couple of listens on all of the Immolation cd's. It's like i like it at first, but at the same time i don't, does that makes sense? After some time though, this has become one of my favorite death metal albums of all time. I don't know what it is about this cd, just the atmosphere, production, riffs, drum-work, everything just rules. I highly recommend this land-mark release to any fan of death metal. Immolation has become one of my favorite death metal bands of all time."
5,Just like ghosts.......souls in hand,"I have to say this is my first Immolation cd , I was expecting this to be brutal , which it very much is, but much much more than that. Great Vocals,Amazing guitar and drumwork. At times i'm reminded of Gorguts or Meshuggah with the polyrhythmic way of playing. This cd can be haunting (see the beginning of ""of martyrs and men"" , and ""rival the eminent"") as well as just downright brutal. I also enjoy the lyrics very much, instead of just full out blasphemy they actually thought about what they were going to write (heres an example from ""sinful nature"", how can we live with ourselves our jealousy, our tyranny the lives we make, the lives we take the fools we serve, the fools we are). Overall i'd recommend this very much so to anyone looking for a not just your typical death metal band."
3,Not their best,"Immolation is one of those bands that you either love or hate. Many have called this Immolation's best album. I must disagree. Dont get me wrong, this is a good death metal album, with many twists and turns, but none of the songs jump out at you. Sure, Reluctant Messiah and A Kingdom Divided are decent songs, but they just cant compare to songs from any other Immolation album. Lastly, the production of the album annoys me. The drums have that triggered feel to them and it takes away from the sound that Immolation has.Of all the Immolation albums, I rarely listen to this one."
3,todo por servir se acaba,"Excelente músico, por lo que precisamente esperaríamos un trabajo excelente de él.Desgraciadamente es un trabajo complaciente y simplón, sin la fuerza creativa y expresiva que caracterizó a sus trabajos anteriores.La experimentación quedó atrás para dar paso a melodías ""bonitas"" que debemos aceptar, están perfectamente ejecutadas.Radius sigue sinendo un virtuoso del instrumento pero desgraciadamente se ha domesticado.Si quieres escuchar un disco agradable ... adelante ... pero no esperes escuchar música de vanguardia."
4,Great Bookend to an Excellent Series,"While some people may find the end of the story exploitive or stupid, it is quite the opposite. The typical character crossover in the comics world consists of two spandex-clad characters meeting, punching each other, then teaming up to solve crimes perpetrated by their opposite numbers. Nothing changes in their respective worlds.Final Orbit is quite the opposite. Ellis uses the Aliens as a force for change, and as a result, the story is spooky and effective."
1,final letdown,"The genius of the Authority and the fantastic Transmet. has produced quite possibly the worst series ending story in existence. Garbage is what this is, pure garbage. I was truly insulted by the choice of scourge. Aliens. Sigourney Weaver's Aliens. Oh yeah. Quite insulting. I won't say how it ends because I want this review posted, suffice it to say that you'll be hurt and digusted. Ellis must have been possessed to write this disaster. DO NOT BUY."
5,"Nice, sturdy, wide enough for suit shoulders","What a good suit hangar should be. Cedar, sturdy, wide enough at the ends that I'm completely confident putting a nice suit on it, unlike many wooden ones in stores."
5,Great TV,"Really nice A/V quality. Simple, effective, not overly technical adjustability. Overall, very happy with this TV, however, having only one HDMI input is definitely a shortcoming if you want to use up-converting/HD-DVD, games, etc. (You'll need a splitter, or manually switch the HDMI, or learn to be happy with the lower resolution the other connections provide.)"
1,I got 2 of these plasmas and they both died!!!,"Buyer beware! I bought this TV from a local store and I had it for a week then I heard a loud snap. The picture went out and it was dead. I returned the TV to the dealer and they gave me a second unit. I had it for 2 weeks and I tried to turn it on one morning and...NOTHING. It was dead. No picture at all. This time I still had sound. I returned it to the dealer and got all my money back. I really wanted this HP plasma TV to be the $1500 high tech wonder I thought it was. Instead it turned out to be a overpriced nightmare. I wound up buying a 32"" tube tv for $300. At least I know it will work. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!"
5,"Great value, quality and style","I shopped around for several 42"" plasmas. The HP was easily the most stylish and I liked the ability to remove the 2 side speakers. The sound quality from the speakers is fantastic. The picture is crystal clear and I haven't experienced any of the negative items seen in some other reviews. HP delivered the TV for free and even set it up for no extra charge. I paid $1500.00"
1,newborn TV dies,"We had this TV for 24 hours.I loved the look and the sound quality was great with the two side speakers. Then, without warning the picture went out. I called HP and they asked me to try one thing, then quickly said the motherboard had gone out. They diagnosed it so quickly that I felt it was happening often. So sad."
1,Do NOT buy HP,"I had this TV for 2 1/2 years and loved it. We had issues with the volume difference between watching movies and TV but other then that no problems at all. Until.........my husband was watching TV and all of a sudden the picture was gone. After trying to figure out the problem ourselves, we called HP. It was going to cost us $629 for them to come out. If they didn't fix it, it would still cost us $369. I think that is crazy for such a newer model of TV. We could not order the part or take it to another place to fix it. Our local TV repair person said that HP does not give out their diagrams to repair places. You have to go threw HP. So now we have a worthless flat screen that is to new to just throw away. We can almost buy a new TV for the price they want to repair it so we are kind of stuck. So DO NOT buy HP! The good reviews are from people that haven't had it go out yet but it will. We loved our TV to up until last week. We looked it up online and it is a huge problem."
1,"Known issue, no service","I recieved this HP when my father in law passed away. I found the original receipt as to when it was purchsed. The picture went out at around the 2 year from purchase date. After looking at the $100 an hour service calls (the warranty was only 1.5 yrs) I started browsing the web to find out if other people were having problems.... and yes!!!! there were many. Finally, after finding a spot on the HP website regarding this apparently known issue I gave HP service a call. Well, to my shock they would not come and fix the plasma because the serial number was not within a certain range. After emailing the customer service link I have not recieved a reply, except for a link requesting me to fill out a survey regarding my latest call to their service department. GEE.... what a turd."
1,PIECE OF TRASH,"The tv worked great...for 2 years. Then the picture and sound went out completely. After numerous fights with HP over the phone, they have decided to stick to their guns about the warranty. So if your warranty has expired, you are 100% out of luck. Seems to be happening very frequently with this tv!"
1,not good,"I cannot decide if this album is a ripoff of Dave Matthews or of Phish. The lyrics are occasionally original, but most often not.To be fair, one of the singers has a good voice, for example in Best Day. But in this and all the other tracks, I can't put into words how irritating the drumming is in most places -- to the point of making it quite taxing to listen to.Bottom line, if you like Dave Matthews or Phish, just buy one of their albums instead -- these artists are as successful as they are for a reason."
5,"ingenious and hilarious, as always","Another incomparable hit! Starts off slowly, with a lot of clever literary references in the dialogue. Then complications set in, and the ending has wonderful twists which extract Barmy and his girl from the scheming skunks. Involves plagiarism and big-time, high-stakes theatre production."
4,Get this concert video while you can,"Christian music videos are notorious for going out of print quickly so this is the time to get this high quality VHS of the standard Sandi Patty concert of the 1990's. Mark Lowry and Sandi's clan appear throughout the video. It all starts with the inspirational pop praise medley and concludes with the Passion medley. The most sparkling moments are the recitation of ""Sam's Rainbow"" and one of the encores of the concert: the song from Sandi's duet album with Kathy Tricolli (""Together"") ""The Last Days"". There are at least three other Sandi VHS concert videos made available to the public: ""Sandi Patti Live"" (1983), ""Let There Be Praise"" (1987), and ""Make His Praise Glorious"" (1989)."
5,The life of a women living in the outback of Aust,This is one of the best books that i have ever read and i would like to read more of her books
2,Pretty basic,"It's good but it has the basic folds every book of this type have. No example images, and at least for me, it's not very easy to follow the instructions. I know some different folding books that are more interesting. If you want different and challenging folds, look a little more out there."
3,How to Fold,This book is good for an idea starter for novice. If you are serious about this and want actual production you should contact the professionals. I like the idea of the CD with the structures shown in the book.
3,Don't expect original ideas for folders.,It is quite a good compilation of solutions that you can use to refresh your mind when creating something new in fact.And it can also be helpful when you don't want to spend much time creating something to your client.
3,Nothing ground breaking...,I teach College and it is handy to get students outside of the letter sized frame of mind. But for a seasoned professional it isn't that jazzy. The box/container book in this series is really good.
4,a must for designer*,"I bought the book last week, and I recommend it to every designer. It shows lot of examples of folding. It gives you ideas for next project."
1,Not very useful,"I purchased this book because I understood from the description that it would be helpful in various kinds of folds, including boxes. The book is primarily a 2 dimensional folding exercise for pretty simple items. I returned it."
2,Disappointing,"Unless you are buying this strictly for decoration, I wouldn't recommend it.I have had mine for about 3 weeks and it has already broken. The top half of the hall stand just fell off. It was attached to the bottom part of the stand with a very small threaded rod that went straight into the (unthreaded) wood. So, in effect, it was going into stripped wood, rather than an anchor like it should have.My boyfriend originally put it together and he complained about all of the screws not really fitting into the holes properly, and consequently the hall tree has always been a little crooked. He is repairing it right now with some stuff he bought at Home Depot.It is definitely not worth what I paid for it."
2,A year later...,"I don't own the product. Its fallen apart so many times I finally got fed up and tossed it out in the garbage. It never did have good support, kept falling over immediately from being top-heavy. Pretty to look at, everyone loved the appearance but in reality, it wasn't that great."
3,HB Air Purifier,"I purchased this unit for my infant son's bedroom approximately a month ago and have been fairly happy with it to this point. He was diagnosed with asthma at 5 months old and has been controlled on medication. As we approached the fall and winter (when asthma is apparently more problematic), I wanted to try some preventative measures and thus, bought the air purifier. We leave it running on low speed at all times and try to keep his door shut. It is a bit noisier than I would have liked, but doesn't seem to disturb the baby. He seems to have had fewer incidents since we began using the air purifier, so it seems to have been a good investment."
5,"Good price, and good quality","After using it during the nights, my wife and I have experience less allergic reaction in the mornings, and we are both very satisfied with this machine. In addition, UV Germicidal light is a plus!"
5,"an overlooked, but great recording","I saw Garden Variety many many moons ago, and I bought ""Knocking"" at the show. I must say that this was one of the best buys I have ever made. If your looking for some angry, fast, and just plain fun music, check out Garden Variety. I only wish I knew what happened to them!"
4,Trips off the tongue,"I thought maybe this was a less well-known kid's book as I seem to have missed it when my first was the ""right"" age, but I see from the reviews it's pretty well known. I'll second much of what is said here - nice illustrations (and nice to see a slightly frumpy, frazzled family that still almost pulls it together - like us!) and fun, readable, bouncy rhymes.Only downside, for us, is we had to try and make the cake. It was (with a bit of adapting) edible, but by no means very good! - and, since they both did most of the cooking - very messy... just like in the story!"
4,Another jewel,"Mary Ann Hoberman is a genius. Her stories are fun to read.My children loved the ""result"" at the end of this book and now have a better understanding of food contents and how much work is involved in cooking for a picky family."
2,I hated reading this book,I had to read this book after all the glowing reviews. I found the story very sad. The poor mother who keeps having kids has the pickiest eaters ever. They don't even eat healthy food. She accomodates all the silly requests. It was pathetic. I love silly books but this one was just sad.
2,"Pretty pictures, but stupid story.","I'm a teacher and can spot a good children's book when I read it, and this one is no good. It teaches children that it's ok to be picky, lazy, demanding and impulsive. It also teaches that cake is a good meal. The pictures are pretty, but that's not worth the ridiculous story."
5,Words and pictures: a perfect match!,"I have to admit that I got carried away by the rhythm of the words. Mary Ann Hoberman's prose -- or poem, actually -- flows like a river. The arrival of each child in the family is a tributary that joins the swiftly flowing river and adds to the volume of its beauty. But there's also a heaviness as each child joins with its own fussy behavior, which threatens to slow the river down to a sluggish waterway; when along comes a change of pace --and voila! A wonderfully surprising ending, that makes us think of a strong river, in full flow... Marla Frazee's illustrations add to the words, are a perfect match, and flow beautifully with the words. They hold the child's attention, while the parent is lost in the whole experience. Thank you, both, for a book that's as much a delight to the parent as to the child! As much an experience as a thing to have..."
5,The Seven Silly Eaters,This book is great for children and their parents.They can share in the diversities of each child and the love between them and their mother. This is great way to helpyour child understand the love a mother has for her children.This is a fun and loving book in which many should read.
5,A winner!,I buy this book in bulk to give as a standard birthday gift. The story brings a smile to the face of every child (and parent).
4,"Silly, indeed.","The poor Mama! She looks so burdened, trying to please her demanding family. My family of helpful little boys just hollered out all sorts of unsolicited advice to Mrs. Peters while we were reading this book -- they seemed very concerned about her situation.Their best advice was... don't change diapers in the kitchen.Hmmm..."
5,One of our favorites...,"I have had this book for about 12 years. WE LOVE IT! I have 4 children ages 16,14,11 & 8-boys & girls. This is a family favorite. Each one of my children has brought this book to school whether it was for show n tell or storytime. My youngest even did an oral book report on it as well-all the foods were great visual aids.The rhymes are funny & entertaining. I HAD TO BUY A NEW BOOK BECAUSE THE OLD ONE WAS WORN OUT!"
5,A Mom's Favorite,"This book not only appeals to my two boys (ages 3 and 6), but also gives me a great laugh each time we read it. What mother can't relate to Mrs. Peter's picky little eaters? If only her outcome in feeding her family were as simple in real life! I highly recommend this book and in fact, just did to a friend of mine who was hoping to borrow it to read to her children's class. I sent her packing to the bookstore...we can't be without this book for any length of time in my house!"
5,GOOOOOOD CD!!!!!!!!!!,"I usually dont really like cover albums, I dunno, most of em are just, bleh- but for THIS legendary treasure, saying ""bleh"" is a sin! This is like, my favorite cd ever, and I know it's kind of recent to put it up at the top but i dont care, this cd is too good. Sometimes when I'm listening to this I forget I'm listening to Iced Earth- THATS how good the covers are!!! and,, when I listen to the original versions now, they actually sound dull compared to these! This whole album is amazing, but my favorites: ""Creatures of the Night"", ""Long Way to the Top"", the 2 Maiden covers, and ""Electric Funeral""(of course, what kind of metal cover album would be complete without a BLACK SABBATH cover???). and just as with every Iced Earth cd, a very nice cover :)Buy this cd and play it LOUD to show all those little Linkin Park-loving kids what HEAVY METAL is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I LOVE THIS CD!I LOVE HEAVY METAL!I LOVE ICED EARTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Pretty damn good cover album!,"I have to say that rarely will I check out a cover album, yet alone buy one, but this one I wish I got sooner!! Iced Earth covers mostly 70s & early 80s tunes but they give these tracks a modern day heavy & raw sound which is nice! They are not trying to perfectly copy the original version of the songs & it sounds like Iced Earth playing them! Definitely cool if you want an upbeat metal album that also gives you a musical history lesson!"
4,God Of Thunder and Rock n' Roll.,"This works, and it's a lot of fun. ""Tribute to the Gods"" is way more focused than Overkill's ""Coverkill"", whereas that particular album seemed to jump from metal to punk...(don't get me wrong, I like Overkill's CD, but I like Iced Earth's more).The best covers are Maiden's '# of the Beast', Priest's 'Screaming For Vengeance', and AC/DC's 'It's A Long Way To The Top...If You Want To Rock n' Roll'.The only thing that keeps this from get 5/5, is the absence of Sabbath's 'Electric Funeral', which I would've rather heard than 'Black Sabbath'.Mark my words, we will see ""Tribute to the Gods II"" some time in the near future."
3,Good album,"With Jon Schaffer's typical habit of doing things over the top, the tittle of this album is TRIBUTE TO THE GODS. Eleven songs (two each from Iron Maiden, AC/DC, Blue Oyster Cult and Kiss - and one each from Black Sabbath, Alice Cooper and Judas Priest)are played with the usual ""hard as a rock - no subtlety"" style typical of Ice Earth. It's not necessaryin your collection, but serve as curiosity."
2,ICED EARTH KICKS SERIOUS ASS.....BUT,"THESE SONGS THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO COVER ARENT ALL GOOD....THE IRON MAIDEN AND PRIEST IS GOOD, BUT THE REST JUST ISNT."
3,NLP for Business,"This book is primarily a course in solving business problems with Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP). It is geared toward showing you how to create and evoke your own internal resourceful states of mind, which will then allow you to create positive solutions for your business needs. Interesting but more of an NLP beginner level book. Some practical guidelines."
3,Got her Freak on,I was never really impressed with her verses I actually thought they were pretty wack but the beat on this was great and it saves this single just a tad but does not help its cause all that much this one I believe was also produced by TimbalandLyrics 3/10 Production 10/10 Overall 6.5/10
1,Wooden cars fell apart,"This set comes with two wooden cars. One wooden car came apart on Christmas day. The axel came out and the wheels fell off. No way to fix the car. One wooden car kept flipping sideways and would not make it down the ramp. Matchbox sized cars will also fit, but Thomas trains will not. Wooden cars would sometimes fly off the back sides of the ramps. Kids liked the idea, but we returned our set. Wood ramps were sturdy, but it was VERY difficult to line up the ramps for assembly. As soon as you get one peg in place, the other pegs popped out. Took about 30 minutes to finally put it together. I was dissapointed, as I had looked at many other ramp racers and opted for Melissa &Doug. This product was not reviewed by anyone on Amazon prior to Xmas of 2006, so I hope this review helps other parents."
4,solid!,This is a great solid construction like the toys of old. It should have more than two cars that come with it though.
4,"Our kids LOVE it, but...","We bought this ramp racer for our 6.5 year old girl and 3 year old boy this Christmas and they absolutely love it! They play with it all the time and love making up stories and games with the 2 cars and ramps. HOWEVER, we bought the recommended race car set with it...DON'T BUY THE SET OF EXTRA RACE CARS TO USE ON THE RAMP RACER!! They are too large and do not fit under the low points of the ramp slopes. I have emailed the company asking them to address the issue. Otherwise, the ramp racer is well built, durable (it's been knocked over at least twice with no problems) and will lead to hours of fun."
2,Falling apart already,"This is a fun toy that a 2.5 year old boy loves, but it is falling apart. We already have had to reconstrunct the flip-down ramp at the bottom, the paint is peeling all over the place and the whole thing is becoming unsteady. My son plays with it as it was intended to be used (he is not abusing the toy, in other words) and it is just not holding up. I'm very disappointed because I bought this one over other brands based on the fact that it is a ""Melissa & Doug"" toy. They may charge a lot more, but the quality is crap. I'm so disappointed!"
3,Other wood car sets don't fit track.,"I purchased the track along with a set of race cars, as suggested by Amazon. The other cars do not fit the track, are way too large, and it only comes with 3 cars. Hot wheels do work on the track also, so that was a life saver. My 18m old loves it! I love it because he can't take it apart. Dissapointed about the other cars tho."
2,Disappointment,"I bought this toy for my 2 year old son, who like every other 2 year boy old LOVES cars! Amazon was GREAT with the fast shipping! We were very happy until Christmas day when we found that the toy did NOT come with the screws needed to put it together. THE SCREWS WERE NOT IN THE BOX!!!! After the the long and gruesome search for the screws that WERE NOT THERE through all of our Christmas wrapping paper AND seeing my son's sad face :( I would like to tell Melissa & Doug YOU RUINED MY SON'S CHRISTMAS!!! When we finally were able to put it together with screws that we bought, the cars that the set came with couldn't make it down the ramp WITHOUT flipping over!!! THIS TOY WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!! I have always felt that Melissa & Doug was one of the best toy venders out there, known for their sturdiness and eye catching toys; but after a few disappointing purchases, and this one in general, I will pass when i see Melissa & Doug!"
5,RAMP RACER APPROVED!,"MY SON LOVES THIS CAR RAMP. HE IS ONLY 22 MONTHS AND HE LOVES TO SEE THE CARS MOVE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM. NO BATTERIES REQUIRED! WHICH IS A BIG PLUS. WORKS WITH MOST OF HIS HOT WHEELS, SO THERE IS NO NEED TO BUY SPECIAL CARS. HE DOES TEND TO KNOCK IT DOWN FROM TIME TO TIME BUT HAS NEVER BROKE ANY PART OF IT. ITS EASY TO PUT TOGETHER. I DID IT MYSELF IN LESS THEN 10 MINUTES. I WOULD RECCOMMEND THIS ITEM."
1,Very Poor Quality,This toy is poorly made for a Melissa & Doug product. It is difficult to assemble and the wooden pieces are glued together and came undone. Don't buy this.
4,Amusing Enough,"We bought this second-hand which is probably why we're pleased with it. I don't think it's worth the price to buy it brand new unless they start including more cars. Our son is vehicle obsessed so it holds his attention probably longer than other kids who don't like cars as much. He really enjoys watching the cars go down and setting them off at different times. We often use matchbox cars on this but most of them flip over by the second ramp and finish on their hoods. Our son doesn't seem to mind this, he doesn't have a perception of how they 'should' go down so it's part of the fun for him. I'd say if your kid really likes cars it's a good toy, otherwise skip it!"
3,Needs more cars,"I bought this for my 2 boys about 2 years ago. They are now 4 and 6. It's a good looking track which is sturdy, colorful. But it only works with the 2 cars shipped with it. Other Melissa and Doug wooden cars are not compatible (too big), and matchbox cars are not heavy enough to stay on the ramp. Since somehow there's always one car missing, our boys rarely end up playing with this toy."
4,Works best with the wooden cars!,"The wooden cars that come with the set work very well. I could not find a Hot Wheels car that did not fly off a ramp - watch out if you try this! Marbles fly off the ramp as well. This is not an educational toy per se, but I use it in an educational setting as a quick reward. The two cars can ""race"" down the ramps, so find a way to keep score and play over and over and over!"
2,"Eh, Its Not That Great","We were excited to get the Melissa and Doug Ramp Racer Game for our children 2 and 4. Unfortunately, it is just not that interesting, amusing, versatile or educational. After watching the cars go down the ramps a few times, the kids are totally uninterested in it. In addition, part of one of the ramps broke off within a few weeks of getting the toy. While I love many Melissa and Doug products, I would not recommend this ramp/racer toy. Ours will likely go in a spring yard sale."
3,Breathtaking in scope; pity about the QA.,"I've been reading this series since 1998, and love it. Having it available in eBook format is a fantastic plus; I'm on limited space, and need to cut back on the physical volumes.Unfortunately, this Kindle edition - unlike the physically printed ""dead tree"" edition - is marred by myriad typos and formatting errors. Some of them are minor (using the wrong apostrophe for abbreviations; hyphenation marks where they don't belong); some are more significant (spelling mistakes, probably from OCR errors that weren't caught on a proof-read; poor text flow - missing paragraph breaks and similar.)The book itself - indeed, the entire series - is a fantastic read, and well worth the asking price. Sadly, the eBook edition needs more polish before it can be called a properly finished product. The same applies to the other three books in the Westlands cycle of the overall series (I haven't yet bought the other 11 books for my Kindle.)"
3,Somber limitation,BPB is this mangey alt-country artist in my favorite incarnation: refined and pronounced. The songwriting doesn't vastly improve but the conscious effort to parlay actual talent rather then obfuscate with questionable wear falls gracefully in Oldham's way and is even accentuated at times when atypically sharing the vocal spotlight.
5,"so simple, yet so nice","this is one of those amazing albums that is just a few chords and a few pluckings, but the recording quality is so intimate and clean and personal you can't help but love it. fat and away his best effort in my eyes."
3,"It grows on you, but...","I bought this album on the recommendation of a friend as well as some reviews I read in various English music magazines. Until now I'd never heard of Will Oldham or whatever he's calling himself this week, but I was curious.The album is pretty good, but he sings so softly that I fear I'm never gonna know what the heck he's singing about without a good pair of headphones and a very quiet room (not likely in my house).Plus, am I the only person who thinks Oldham is trying to channel Nick Drake here? Heck, if I want Nick Drake I'll go put on ""Bryter Layter.""I would like someone to LOAN me another one of Bonnie Prince Billy's albums to see if it's any different, as Mr. Oldham certainly has something to say. I just wish he'd say it a little louder."
1,Post-modernism is for Nazi sympathizing pederasts.,"It's been well over a solid decade since closet yuppie Will Oldham started milking ""po'white"" culture for his chic fringe dwelling mates and it's about time someone took him to task for it. This guy's music is so fake I bet he has Brett Easton Ellis on speed dial. Avoid, unless you really do like some bald dude with a trust fund getting his ""back-woods Brecht"" on."
4,Excellent Arts & Crafts Furniture,"The designs that Schultz uses have an asian flair to them, adding curves to Arts & Crafts style furniture. Cutting these curves is certainly more work than traditional straight Stickley furniture, but it also adds a nice touch.Schultz includes a section at the beginning of the book covering technique, which is especially helpful on the curved legs. This section also includes information on making mortise and tenon joinery with a router.There are many plans in this book, and they are accompanied by color photos of the finished product; which I really like. I would prefer better detailed drawings, and more of them, but the text is quite descriptive. It just takes me a little more to figure it out that way.This is one of my favorite Arts & Crafts furniture books and I refer to it when drawing my own plans for a piece in our home."
2,Not that great,"Really cheesy designs and lousy construction. Good side bar on making flared legs. Otherwise, I got nothing from this book. I also bought ""The Furniture of Gustav Stickley"" which is much better."
4,lovely book,"This book is a helpful resource for those who are at least intermediate woodworkers. Nice, simple, basic furniture and good instructions-- but it assumes a certain knowledge base that a true beginner does not possess. excellent photos as well."
5,Barks scores again,"The Soul of Rumi is Barks most sustained adaptations of Rumi to date. It should reach a wide audience and of special note is his translation of Book IV of the Masnavi, Rumi's masterpiece (and previously available only in Nicholson scholarly and stilted version). Barks has a way to make Rumi's rich imagery come alive in a natural American diction. In this volume Barks own natural voice is brought to the fore with acknowledgement of his own limitations and appreciation of the guidance he has found along the way, making this the most fulsome account of his own interpretations of the Persian poet."
5,"not ""The essential Rumi"", instead the most essential","This is the best book of Rumi translations there is. It has so much Rumi -- much more than ""The Essential Rumi"" -- & includes the complete book IV of the Masnavi, one of the greatest Persian classics. Get this book. This is the Rumi book. This is thge spiritual poetry books, of all the ones that want to be."
5,Good read,"This book had some great lines and remarkable phrases. However, it can be too much if you sit down and read it all. This book is great if read in parts, otherwise, its just too much at once and you forget the great ideas beause so many new ones come back atcha!"
1,Find Rumi's Essence Elsewhere,"Rumi is one of my favorite poets but Barks does not do him justice. The translation poorly written so it feels choppy. Furthermore, he changes it so it water down the power of Rumi's poetry. Do not choose this book."
1,A Beginner's Book for Experienced Programmers,"I bought this book so that I could learn VC++.net. From reading it, it appears that if you are already an experienced VC++ programmer, then you'll be able to understand what they're trying to teach you. I am using the original studio.net, and maybe the book is geared towards studio.net 2003 - but I could not find info stating that.The text/screen shots of the examples are of so poor quality that it is extremely difficult to read and prone to the reader making mistakes. The ebook included on the CD is of the same poor quality. The code examples on the CD are only of the extra examples, and not of the main tutorial. Once I got stuck - the book provided no way to get answers.In the end I browsed the web and found sites giving VC++.net tutorials.My advice - Save your money - browse the web."
3,Get Cogswell's other book,"This book is okay. You can tell it was written by multiple people, because some pages have a very different writing style and very different screenshot looks from the rest of the book. I'm not sure why they put Cogswell's name on the cover. He wrote a better book in the Dummies series about C++. Get that one instead. It has a section on C++.NET and is much better than this one."
2,Unable to recommend this book,"Unfortunately, I cannot give this book a good recommendation.The book is difficult to follow and its true what another review wrote that the screen shots presented in the book are difficult to follow. The verbiage in the book is okay but it needs improvement...that is why I gave this book 2 stars instead of 1. Its unfortunate, but I will have to try a different book to learn Visual C++.NET."
3,a little repetative,A good album but I find that loading it on my ipod and doing a shuffle is the best way to listen. I find sitting down and listing to the complete CD it becomes repetative. I also like it in the car. I will hear one or two tracks. Get where I'm going and then dance on the eay back home.
2,Viet Nam Misfire,"Heroes was made at the height of Henry Winkler's popularity as Fonzie on the popular sitcom Happy Days, at a time when many thought a great actor lurked beneath the leather jacket and smile. In this bizarre little film he portrays a Viet Nam veteran with dreams of opening up a worm farm. Escaping from a mental hospital he hooks up with Sally Field in her pre-Oscar days and finds a Viet Nam buddy along the way, played with genuinely spooking intensity by Harrison Ford, the film's only bright spot. Of course Winkler is carrying around ghosts, but he lacks the acting chops to draw us into the story and make us care about him. Eventually his eide eyed performance becomes over wrought and finally ridiculous, which is not I suspect, what was intended. A curiousity piece at best. Made the year before Coming Home and The Deer Hunter, it was quickly and mercifully forgotten."
3,Ending Blunted By Generic Replacement of Kansas Song,"The ending of this movie has always been etched in my memory as one of the most harrowing depictions of what would later be called PTSD I've seen in film. It's blunted and trivialized somewhat by the replacement of ""Carry On Wayward Son"" by Kansas with a generic rock song over the end credits. The reason I have a fond memory of that song is because of this movie, so to see the ending altered in such a crude way is somewhat upsetting. However, the movie itself is still worth a look for a flawed but interesting and risky performance by Henry Winkler, and good supporting roles by Sally Field and Harrison Ford before both became the respected Hollywood actors they are now. The movie as a whole is hit and miss, but its depiction of PTSD I think is fairly accurate, though the subject was better handled some years later in Peter Weir's Fearless."
2,Does anybody know if the original version of the movie is available?,"I saw this movie in the theater in 1977 and the ending is very powerful, the song Carry On My Wayward Son MAKES the ending powerful, and in fact makes the whole movie. Now I see from the other reviewers, that the song was removed from this DVD version of the movie, which changes the ending considerably. If the song is credited to the group Kansas, why in the WORLD would they take it out? I will pass on purchasing this version. Thanks to everyone who alerted prospective buyers to this ridiculous alteration to the movie in this DVD. I would like to know if anyone knows if the original movie version is available on DVD or VHS (with CC- English captions for the hearing impaired).If anyone finds one, I would appreciate finding out the name of the company that released it or where it can be found. Thank you."
3,disappointed,"Love this movie, not the copy I received, the main song at the end was dubbed out (carry on our wayward son). Disappointed."
2,False advertising,"This is *NOT* the 1977 movie 'Heroes'. It is a pathetic, butchered imitation thereof. Buying it will only encourage Big Media to think they can get away with selling cheap ripoffs instead of the real thing. Yes, this is entirely because of the removal of the song 'Carry On Wayward Son' from the ending; it really does make that much difference. What was a powerful climax has become a fizzle."
3,Molina/Oldham,Another of Jason Molina/Will Oldham mellow cd's.They are joined by Alasdair Roberts (Appendix Out).This isn't better than the Bonnie 'prince' Billy/Matt Sweeney cd.
4,good explanation for non-economists,"This book, a guide to the WTO agreements, gives a brief historical background of the framework that produced them, and also predecessor agreements whenever these are relevant for understanding the new provisions. The text explains technical terms in understandable language, giving examples whenever appropriate. The author, a fomer India's ambassador and Permanent Representative to GATT and Deputy Permanent Representative to UNCTAD, wrote it based on the materials prepared as the training modules for UNCTAD; so don't expect to find any critical view of the WTO agreements, but rather a concise explanation of them."
5,awesome shirt,i got this tshirt for my hubby because we were going to OzFest. Pantera is a great band and the tshirt was a great buy! i thought the design was really kewl. my hubby still wears his shirt!
5,Great Shirt,"I've received a lot of compliments on this shirt along with a few ""odd"" looks (you know, from Fundies, Boy Scouts, old fogies, et cetera). It's not cheaply made either. I've had it for a couple of years now and the graphic hasn't faded or peeled a bit.Note: There's no graphic on the back."
1,"""All that glitters is not gold.""","Somehow, no matter how great this kit looked online and even IN the package, it is still a bad kit. The case was too small to hold my PSP 2000 (which is SMALLER than the original PSP) and the cartridge holders without breaking the zipper (which it did twice when I tried). I do not know how the dock fits other PSPs, but it did not fit mine (cheap plastic anyway). The headphones turned out to be slimmed down to fit in that nifty roll-up container and as good as listening through three layers of cardboard. I did not use screen protector because I wanted to return it, and I do not even WANT to know what the car adapter would have done to my PSP..."
1,Ripoff,Includes:-a PSP dock it... that was already available in the PSP pack I bought-Earphones that are not as good quality as the ones sold with the PSP-A car charger for those who really need to charge the PSP while going to work to be able to play in the bathroom-A neck strap for those who think that a PSP can compete with Bling around the neck-A screen lens protector that is already scratched and gives a 10 year old feel to your brand new PSP.-The only valuable piece in the whole kit: The neoprene case. However the strap that holds it snaps after 5 minutes in your hand.If i had one advice to give you... don't buy it
1,Dont waste your time,"This is a complete waste of time and money, do not buy it!!! I kept the case to hold the umd's and psp,until i can get a better one,but got rid of everything else!!!"
1,What the ****?!?!?!,"Okay, so I'm reading the other reviews, I saw the picture of what is being sold, (very excited I might add that the docking station is included), to then realize from the other comments, in fact, THERE IS NO DOCKING STATION. Yawn! How misleading is that? You don't ""show"" something in an ad and then not include in the package. Based on these other reviews, this sounds like a waste of money and the vendor clearly is misleading people. Thanks for all the reviews so I don't waste my money!!!"
3,Young Adults Review,The only good thing in the starter kit that was worth anything was the carring case itself. The headphones are so cheap that U can hardly hear Anything. The charger Would Keep pushing itself out of the socket in my car and my moms car. the stand was ok but there is really no point to it. The game cases were OK
2,Matching models wrong size,"I have the same model listed on the package it even has a picture of it on the box but the filter is only half the size of the original carbon filter. It was so small it didn't reach the ""grippers"" that hold it in place so i just basically threw it in and closed the panel. You get what you pay for"
5,awesome movie set.,These movie are very funny and great for the whole family to watch. They thought the movies were funny and watched them over and over.
3,"Some good, some not so good.","I bought this set because I wanted a copy of King Ralph, a nice little John Goodman film that features the great Peter O'Toole. We started watching Pure Luck, but it really didn't engage us and Ghost Dad (with Bill Cosby has always been not that great. We haven't seen For Richer... yet, so I'm not sure if we'll like that one or not.But as a collection that isn't that expensive, this was a great way to add a wanted film to my DVD collection. The only disappointment is that no extras are included with the films, but I don't buy films for the extras, anyway."
3,Enjoyable movies,"All four of these movie are enjoyable. Our favorite is 'For Richer For Poorer', I always like Tim Allen movies and Christy Ally is a great match for him in this movie."
2,Down Waste Your Money,This book is too small for one to appreciate the beauty of religious artwork from Eygpt and there are many better ones out there. Don't bother with this book. It is a waste of money.
4,Works well but very noisy!,"This air purifier works very well to eliminate dust, polllen, etc. from the room. The auto detector kicks it into higher speeds when impurities are discovered -- very cool! It is extremely loud, however. It is essesntially a three-speed fan and its noise level is comparable to a medium-sized fan. We turn it off at night because it's in our master bedroom and keeps us awake a night. I'm pretty sure mose machines like this will create a similar noise level, so I still give it a high score."
2,Works great....until it breaks,"This purifier worked well for about 5 months when it broke. The fan motor just died. The cost of repair, plus all of the expensive filters etc. make this one costly unit to operate. ..."
2,Cleans well but...,"It did a great job of cleaning the air. I noticed right away that I wasn't nearly as congested. However it is a bit noisy, and the motor burned out after about 8 months of moderate use."
3,What is this smell coming out of it?,"It smells like ""new factory"" plastic, and I suspect it comes from the HEPA filter. I see one of the reviewers mentioned it. Does everyone else have this problem? Please let me know if there is a way to get rid of it.Besides the smell, everything else works fine. The noise is acceptable, and the sensor seems working."
1,Does NOT work for seasonal allergies!,"So I bought 2 of these Air Purifiers from Amazon after seeing them highly recommemded online and their claim that they remove 99.97% of all allergens from the air including particles as small as 0.3 microns. After continuously running for 2 weeks, they haven't made ANY difference in either the kids' or my pollen allergies. The digital display continues to claim that the air quality is ""Good"", I even tried running it at High, but it doesn't seem to have removed any pollen from the air whatsoever. Called up Hamilton beach Customer Service today to see if I was doing something wrong and they were quite unhelpful Just said that if it doesn't work for you, return it, which I plan to do!"
3,Which one would you Choose?,"I at a point where i need to buy one, i live in a place where it's just dust city. I have bought the Ionic Breeze and something from Home Depot. None of them did the job. Now, this one they say is good, i like the Air-Quality Sensor screen.But there's one that they are selling on HSN called the Hunter QuietFlo HEPAtech Air Purifier and Ionizer. They say that one is quieter but people have a hard time replacing the filters because they can't find them. Need Help."
1,Loud and expensive to operate,Initial value is good but the continued operation of the unit is costly. Figure it will cost you near the price of the unit each year in replacement filters and bulbs. Higher line units may have an initial cost of 2-3 times the price of this unit... but if you operate the unit for 3 or more years you have reached the pay-back point. Also higher line units offer higher CFM rates that will cover a larger area. If Hamilton Beach would cut the cost of their replacement parts in half.. this would be a very nice unit.
3,Made a difference in my family's Quality of Life,"I would recommend this to all my loved ones - friends & family. I like performance of this unit in my apartment - made really big difference in air quality. I gave 3 start only because if its noise. This unit is designed for residential use, but sounds somewhat more suitable for heavy duty environment. =)If noise cannot bother you as a big of the issue, this is pretty good.(...)"
2,Not for newcomers,"This book assumes you already know something about table saws, I dont and I found this book no help to me. Having read this book, I dont feel any safer or smarter about my new saw and how to use it. I read 'The Bandsaw Book' by Lonnie Bird, and it was fabulous for a neophite like me. I wish he would have done the table saw too!"
2,Item pictured is not what is received,"Received the item promptly but had a couple issues:1. Item was not as described nor as pictured. Item is labeled different and didn't come in a box (partly because Seller's ad stated there were ""100 per pack, .57 cent each pack"", when in fact it was priced INDIVIDUALLY but not stated so in ad (seller has since revised ad).2. Item has an off smell - almost like dill pickles. Doesn't seem like it's old stock, as exp date appears to be 09/14.3. Despite description, lotion does seem a bit greasy. Had to wash it off as between the consistency and the smell I didn't like it.Unknown if it works as sunscreen as I won't use it... can't get past the odor.The good part is that the seller was a prompt shipper, but between them not living up to their advertised price, the poor quality of the lotion, and not getting the item that was described, I would not buy this item or from this seller again."
3,Excessive exercise,"Although a little too consumed with their technical articulations on silliness to truly pummel at desired effect, the band does offer a dizzying array of scattered scorching throughout the convoluted convulsions."
4,"Jazzy, inspired... but a bit short","It is really incredible to see Barry Manilow bounce back into the charts with one excellent album after the other, especially now that he clearly puts his emphasis on jazz.""A Christmas Gift of Love"" is certainly one of the best Christmas albums ever recorded, and the mix of standards, surprises and newly written material is just perfect. Barry Manilow's version of ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"" is probably the best rendition this song ever received. Joni Mitchell's ""River"" is a perfect addition to the wonderful mood of this CD and the self-penned closing number makes you want to start playing it all over again immediately... which also brings me to the only minor irritation: at a mere 33 minutes this ""Gift"" could have included a bit more music or at least longer tracks."
1,terrible,"I am a manilow fan, but this album really is terrible, played once and i had a blue christmas"
4,Great... But Where's The Rest?,"This Is A Great Christmas Release But Just Like The New Johnny Mathis Christmas Cd, This Clocks In At Just Over 30:00. YIKES Sony(Columbia) Should Have Just Put Them Together On One Disc!!!Beyond That It A Terrific Cd With Great Arrangements!!! Barry Sounds Good & He Is Dueting With BARBRA On Her ""DUETS"" Cd So I Am Happy!!! Happy Holidays All-David"
3,Very Veeegaas!,"We enjoyed this CD and Mr. Manilow's voice, but were a tiny bit put off by the smattering of smarmy glitz present. Though we've never been to Las Vegas, nor do we want to visit, the influence of that cursory destination is highly evident in Barry's arrangements."
2,I Feel Cheated,"First of all, I AM a Barry Manilow fan. When I heard that a new Christmas album was coming out in 2002, I was excited. After his first Christmas album, Because It's Christmas, which was an excellent album, I couldn't wait to buy this one and hear it. What a disappointment. Only 11 songs, most of them shorter than 3 minutes, some not even 2 minutes long. There's not a standout song on the entire album. Better luck next time, Barry."
4,"Manilow Scores with "" A Christmas Gift of Love""","Manilow scores big with "" A Christmas Gift of love"". This Cd is full of what is great about the holidays. From track one to track eleven you are compelled to move and grove to the sounds. Manilow takes the classics and makes them his own. Love the Big band, Swing sound and the lavish orchestrations make these songs jump out at you. Only regret is that this CD is just too short. Would have loved to have heard a few more selections. Barry gets you worked up and in the mood then he leaves you hanging for more. A great companion to the first Christmas album "" Because it's Christmas"""
1,B Manilow -A Gift of Love,"This cd is the worst that I have ever bought of BarryManilows, this has the same rating as his Paradise cafe albumAlso Barrys Ultimate Manilow is just another cd with previous songs.Cann^t say that I am impressed with the Latest cds!"
4,Manilow Xmas,"I actually bought this album for the song, River, written by Joni Mitchell. As christmas albums go it is fine. Manilow has a voice that is very easy on the ear. I am a loyal fan from when it all started in the 70's."
1,Do not buy this product,I have had such a lousy experiance with this machine. I have burnt about 2 cds and wasted atleast 30 other cds trying to get this machine to burn. It takes forever to burn and then when it is almost done it just says there is an error and you've wasted 20 minutes on a cd that didn't burn and is not usable. I went through customer service and customer support and they kept telling me to do the same things that they told me to do the time before when I went for help. Save your money and buy a different brand. I have lost all faith in HP products as of now.
4,So far so good.,"I got this burner yesterday. It is fairly easy to setup. First I installed the hardware then pop in the driver floppy disk. After that I installed the software. It is fairly easy to use too, I burned my first data cd within 30 minutes. I was surprise how big this burner really is, from the pic above it looks small but this thing is about 10 inches long and 5 inches wide. But that's no biggie as long as it keeps burning. One complain though, it takes a while for me to burn stuff. Like it took about 12 minutes to extract one CD and about 5 minutes to burn my data CD. That's like an eternity. It'd be so much better if they make it a lil faster. But I guess with this price, that's the best u can get."
1,"Hewlett Packard Customer ""Service""???","If you are thinking about buying this produce, chose Sony or some other brand. Not only does their software not work as advertised, but they have no customer service to speak of. You have to dial a long distance number, sit on hold for at least 30 minutes, only to be told: the problem is your computer, your ISP, etc., anyone but them. When they finally admitted to a software loading problem, and confessed that it does not come with the software to make the product work the way they advertise it should, their answer was: buy RW discs and keep trying! It takes 8 tries to make a disc, and forget about music discs - it cuts the last few seconds from most tracks. DON'T BUY THIS. In fact, steer clear of HP altogether and you will be much happier. If I could have rated it a ZERO, I would."
1,Junk!,"I wish I had read the other reviews before wasting two days of my life trying to set up this piece of junk. My experience was with a Gateway desktop machine, not a laptop. As stated above, it cannot recognize CD-R disks properly during ""write"" process, spits them out, thinks they are high speed. It consistently hangs up during the read process.Most importantly--HP SUPPORT IS NONEXISTENT!! Hours on the (long distance) ""help"" line would have been better spent on the home shopping network, although the suggestion that I email them with the problem was novel and humorous.You may as well carve CDs out of stone tablets if this is the only other option."
3,"If you have Adaptec Easy cd creator ver. 4.02d, it's OK!","If you happen to own Adaptec (Roxio) Easy CD Creator 4.02d and/or Direct CD 3.01d, according from Adaptec (Roxio) website, HP 8230e is compatible with these two softwares. You can get Easy CD with ($) rebate before Dec 31st,00, details for rebate check out...Be careful, HP always has a problem with buffer underrun, so you have to select advance option (from copying CD software) and burn the CD through your hard drive (usually people use this option to burn multiple copies) to overcome this problem. It is a lot slower, yet it works.If you can afford, go for external Firewire( IEE 1394 or i-link...they are all the same) or SCSI CDRW. They are a lot faster.Go for new Yamaha 2100EZ or TDK (new one) for burn proof technology. Both of them are internal and costing more however.I hope it helps."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,"i am now on my THIRD drive of this model. I bought the original just 4 months ago, and it stopped working 3 months later (wouldn't burn a full CD). HP then sent me a second one, which quit working 1 month later (wouldn't read audio track information correctly.) The third product HP sent me has NEVER worked, unless you burn at an excruciatingly slow 1x speed. And this is using an HP computer, HP disks, and all HP software. According to HP tech support ""these things just stop working after a couple of months."" If you like software that crashes 1 out of every 3 times, and hardware that works less reliably than that, then this drive is for you! Or, purchase this if you really like talking to tech support people, 'cuz you'll be on the phone with them weekly (and it's a toll call.) Enjoy!"
1,hp 8200e usb wont work with win 2000 pro....darnit !!!!!!!,"Did a clean install of 98se to w2k pro. I can not get my hp 8200e to operate fully. I can burn small files and 1-3 mps'3 at a time but errors out if I cue up 10-12 mp3's. Also, If I try and burn a large data file it will error. ASPI ...checked and shows ok cdr software used 1) : easy cd 5.01 less take two 2) : various versions of nero 3) : clone cd also have tried various media. also have tried various hp driver updates, but only 5.0.2183.1 dated 11/14/99 will work.If you have any ideas.......????? yeah, I'd like to know"
1,Problems,"The 8230 comes with a very friendly price tag. Unfortunatly, you get what you pay for.I have had the 8230e for several months now and I continue to have problems burning audio CD's. My success rate is less than 50%. The drive has successfully burned MP3 files into CD format from HP MyCD at 4x speed less than half as many times as I have tried. The drive has always been successful when burning MP3's in Music Match Jukebox, however the fastest it will burn is 2x. I have only been able to make a direct copy of an audio CD twice out of over 20 attempts.Data CD's are not a problem.The error that consistantly appears is ""Buffer Underrun"". Despite closing all programs, disabling all power management and downloading and installing the latest drivers and program updates, the drive still fails to work consistantly.MY ADVICE: Spend a little extra money and purchase a better drive."
1,Absolute Garbage,"This is without a doubt the worst computer hardware that I've ever encountered in all of my years. It is very unreliable. I got it to burn ONE cd (the disc that came with it) out of TWENTY. The customer support people were friendly enough, but very unhelpful. After my third call, I was told to buy yet ANOTHER pack of discs. I was very hopeful that this would work...however I got the same silly error message over, and over, and over again.I worked with this for three days straight, and got one CD. Finally, I returned it.Save yourself the trouble.....don't buy this. Don't even THINK about buying it. Stay FAR FAR FAR FAR away from it!"
1,Misrepresented piece of junk!,"Shipped me an old 8200f burner with 8220e/8230e software. Will burn files and folders...However, just opening up a CD containing a Windows Folder (Not even trying to open the folder!)in DLA causes total computer Memory Dump and requires System Restore. Spent six hours and $20 worth of blank CD's doing all upgrades, patches, workarounds, etc. Is not a USB problem, as a CD ceated in DLA by this burner does the same thing when opened on my internal NEC burner. Worthless and I can't trust it with my data, so I'll have to go buy another one.Already spent too much time to want to go through the hassle of returning it. I've spent thousands of dollars with Amazon.com, but I'm now reexamining...Will prbably go to Best Buy in the future!"
1,Absolutely worthless and a major headache,"All summed up in one word is easy to do on this one: BAD!!!! It has great and easy software, but is a headache. The hardware is bottom-of-the-line misfit junk, and screws up the computer very very badly. One time, one of my computers was having a hard time starting the hardware. I ended the task and shut down, and when it was started again, it only started in safe mode, never to work again!! I ended up uninstalling every last driver and software and reinstalling it to get the computer working again. the warranty had expired, so the thing got thrown in the garbage. I hope a compactor has flattened this peice of garbage. HP has absolutely no reliability. We tried an internal one of their burners before this, and were able to return it. the internal screws the system up just as bad as this one. DO NOT buy HP products. The only thing that they are even remotely good at making is printers."
1,"Poor Product, Marginal Tech Support","Bought this to support my home desktop (older Pentium running Windows 98)and work laptop (PII Running Windows 2000). Could not get the burner to work consistently. Tech Support was marginal in advising me that I did not have enough system resources (shocker I know). However, even w/ all processes shut down and with plenty of resouces it still didn't work consistently. Finally got fed up and bought a Iomega Predator and have had nothing but success with that product. Well worth the extra 50 dollars."
2,Can anyone please help me?,I bought this cd-burner about a month ago. I havent got it to work yet. I have been getting the same high speed message. I dont know what to do. I have re-installed it over and over...this thing is driving me crazy. I dont know what to do...
2,"Good Hardware, But Serious Compatibility Problems","This CD burner worked perfectly when it was working ... but unfortunately, I had severe compatibility problems using it with my Compaq (running off a Pentium III). The software wasn't very intuitive to begin with, and would crash my system repeatedly without warning. Bizarre installation problems turned into frequent reboots, which eventually turned into fatal exception errors. For the first couple of days, I was making flawless CDs; but after a week, I was struggling just to keep my computer running. So yes, it's great hardware, but if you get system errors early on, be very careful."
3,Reasonable burner - miserable software,"I have had mine for a week now, and after a rocky start, I am fairly happy with it. As far as the recorder hardware goes, it works fine. It is a little slow (4x), but that is due to the USB more than anything else. It's biggest shortcoming is the awful ""MyCD"" software that it comes with. It also came with Adaptec's barely adequate DirectCD as well. Get new software if you want to use this drive! Also, due to the shared nature of the USB interface (the 'B' is 'Bus' after all), you don't want to do much of anything else while it writes - especially don't let your screen saver start up."
2,Suggestions for avoiding coasters,"My experience echoed a lot of the complaints here. The set-up worked fine on my Dell Latitude, and the drive made data disks just fine, but no music disks. It would report a write error and spit out a coaster every time. After weeks of frustration, I tried this: shut down all programs, including the screen saver, rebooted. Opened HP RecordNow. At the ""Welcome to Record Now"" menu, I clicked Options, then the Advanced tab. For Recorder Speed, I checked ""limit maximum recorder speed to 1x."" Since then, I've burned several music CD's with no coasters. It's not fast, but it's working. Clearly an inferior piece of equipment, but since I can't return it, I'm happy I can at least make it work."
2,More problems than discs,"I bought this cd burner about a year ago. Problems with burning cds occured anytime I tried to burn a cd while multitasking other programs. I was forced to only burn cd's when I had nothing else to do on my computer. Since each cd takes at least 45 mins to burn this was not the best situation for me. My computer no longer sees the cd burner attached to the usb port. Upon visiting the hewlett packard site I was appalled to learn that I must spend at least [$] for troubleshooting since my product is no longer covered by waranty. When I bought this thing it was over [$]. I burned about 20 discs. Works out to over 15 bucks a disc, geez might as well have just kept going to music stores."
3,Okay product,"Looking for an USB CD writer because I have multiple machines at home including a notebook. For anyone who is not in a hurry, wait for a USB 2.0 CD burner (speed is 480 mbps rather than 11 mbps).Install the CD writer into my Dell Latitude notebook running Win2000 Professional. Connect everything up and the machine freeze as soon as the driver is installed. Can't even safe boot into command prompt (have to disconnect USB drive). Spend 2-3 hours trying different things including downloading latest HP drivers. Eventually, went to Dell web site and found a BIOS update that fixes the problem (readme.txt states a problem with HP CD-Writer). Update the BIOS and everything works. The whole ordeal lasts about 1/2 day.I have burned about 20 Cd so far and don't have any problem. Drive speed is okay but the software is very weak. The size of the unit is also larger than I expected (maybe 10 inches deep?)...."
1,Awful,"Software write error. Error stated I was using a high speed disc which was incompatible with the drive. I was using standard Sony discs. Spent two hours with tech support and still, did not work. Tech support says software 'record now' is new to them. My computer operating at optimum speed and still, did not work. A waste of time and money."
1,"I'm returning mine, Don't bother buying it","I found this cd-rw to install very easily, and it was very well priced, but I just could not use any disks that were 1x-16x or 1x-12x compatible, and that is baisically all you can find out there. I have hundreds of extra disks lying around that do not work with this drive. Error message after error message and ruined cd after ruined cd, I am returning this piece of junk and spending the extra hundred like i should have in the first place."
4,Arthur Learns Teamwork,"Children who are ready for their first chapter books will enjoy reading about Arthur's adventures on his ball team. The story is written in a fast-paced style with a lot of dialogue, so most kids will zip through it in no time. The book's emphasis on teamwork and encouraging others just makes the story that much more worthwhile. Great for kids, regardless of whether they are Arthur fans."
4,Lounge Rap Buttering Up,"J.Rawls was best known for producing Mos Def and Talib Kewli, but he is also the other half of the Lone Catalysts (Cincinnati.) A little lounge music, light jazz, sweet beats are what he has assembled here. This is a full blown studio show, imitating the art of the lounge act. OG's will hate this rap; jazz fans will soak it up. ""Dank and Jammy Show"" is more for wine and smoke rather than for carburetors and hydralics.If Quincy Jones' ""Juke Joint"" symbolize the early juke singing of the 30's, then ""Dank and Jammy""represent the modern jukin' of jazz clubs. Take it a bit tongue-in-cheek, but trust it: the cd delivers and doesn't scream out with a `what the hell??' cut. Smooth rap has its place but I wouldn't play this cd at a party unless you're playing cards. Stretch out and wear this cd.It fits.Jeff Feezle of Macafeez"
5,Tasty recipes,"I didn't buy this book for the diet. I bought it for the recipes. There are alot of good ideas. I've always liked pocket sandwiches. this book gave me some new ideas. If I lose weight, that will be a bonus."
4,Perfect Portion Control,For me watching my weight is a big deal and this helps me I also receive a alot of comments that the pockets look really goos and they want recepies.
1,Deceptive and outdated,"The title of Davidson's work certainly doesn't lack in aspiration, however, it proves the point that appearances are deceptive! It's disappointing in comprehensive coverage, bar maybe it's narrow scope on MBS. Worse though, statistics and contents are largely outdated. Even though I found a few rare pages worthy of reading, I still can't recommend this book to anyone. There are many superior alternatives in the market."
2,Compendium,"This is yet another compendium of contributed works. While this book isn't awful enough for one star, it isn't good enough for three. I woudl have felt more neutral if it said anything new or anything that you can't get from the fixed income research group of an investment bank or trading house for free, such as one right here in Greenwich."
2,Mortgage Backed Securities,This wasn't a particularly good overview of the securitization market. It focusses on cash U.S. mortgage backed securities.
1,Cute...but beware,"Prior to purchasing these shoes, I read a review where the reviewer experienced discomfort with this style. However, I'd owned several pairs of Reebok Classics in the past so I felt this was a lone bad review. Unfortunately I should have heeded the advice given by the prior review. These shoes were SO UNcomfortable after only being worn for a few hours, that I couldn't wait to get home to get them off my feet! After wearing them only a short time the bottom of my feet were near raw and very sore. I've never experienced my feet hurting after long-term wear of sneakers! My experience was so bad that I only wore these shoes once. I do not recommend them."
3,"Next to silk, these just don't cut it.","I purchased this plant because I have used the Tetra plants in the past and have been happy with them. Well, ignorance is bliss! In the same order, I also purchased Vibran-Sea and biOrb products and the difference in price was more than worth it. The plastic Tetra product just looks fake next to the other products. The more expensive products also have far superior bases. The base on the Tetra plant is clear plastic, hollow v-shaped, and 2"" long. By burying it in the gravel substrate, it stays in place --- unless you have Cichlids with their penchant for moving gravel, or you clean your tank; in either case, you end up with floating plastic. The more expensive plants mentioned above use ceramic bases which stay in place much better. In comparison, the Tetra plants just don't measure up; they are perfectly functional but just don't look very natural."
3,Plant is good...but received it broken,I was very excited to put this plant into my aquarium...but received it with a broken base. Still works but it should have been in a better packing :(
3,Nutty,"This is a good recording. Monk is solid throughout, and it's nice to hear him fill the spaces he created in other ensembles when playing with Coletrane, Miles Davis, and Rollins. But the rhythm section leaves much to be desired. Al McKibbon's bass playing is plain and unembellished, which is contrary to what is expected from the instrument in a small ensemble format. And Art Blakey, who played well with McKibbon in the Herbie Nichols trio, is sedate and not very creative in this recording.This is a good CD for the connoisseur but not a good place for someone relatively unfamiliar with Monk to begin."
1,Cheaply made garbage!,"With a title like ""Bizarre lust of a sexual deviant"" you would think this movie would be creepy and edgy but what you get is a very soft core B-movie. I won't bother you by talking about the so called plot because there isn't much of one. Here's the overview. A guy knocks women out,takes pictures of them naked and then goes home...that's it. Oh yeah, he also likes to touch the womens necks and shoulders while they are knocked out. He is very careful not to actually touch the womens private areas because that would cross the line from being a bizarre sexual deviant to being just a sexual deviant. This movie is so bad i actually threw it away. Avoid at all cost!"
1,"Terrible, not what I expected!","This product was not as good as I thought it would be. There were good parts but overall, I was not satisfied with this movie. For a person looking for real womanization (for lack of a better word, I would not recommend this one."
1,Ripoff Artist,"I purchased Stopzilla in 2006 and when MS IE7 hit the market, the software would not work. I un-installed it and let them know via phone that I had stop using the software. They still billed my credit card for the renewal price each year. I missed it in 2007 but caught it in 2008. I called them and credited my card for the $39.95 charged in 2008 but refused to give me credit in 2007 stating that they had no record of my cancellation. There are better products on the market--Don't Buy!!!!"
1,Beware! They tried to overcharge my credit card,"At first, I thought Stopzilla was great: it found a Trojan that few other AV softwares could find.It then proceeded to ask me to buy a subscription in order to remove the Trojan.I bought the subscription, which was advertised at $9.95 on their website. The total of the credit card transaction was also indicated as $9.95.I activated the software.Stopzilla told me that it had removed the Trojan. However, the Trojan reappeared immediately after. I was never able to use Stopzilla to remove it.The next day, I saw on my credit card statement that I had actually been billed $39.95.You tell me: is all this a good sign for an antivirus software?My advice to you: don't buy it."
1,Be aware of this Scam Company,"With so many Credit thefts nowadays, I pay more attension to the details of my credit card bills lately. Today, there is a mysterious charge of 39.95 on my bill from STOPZILLA 877-877-9944 FL.I did purchases a copy of their software 3 years ago with full payment without anyextended terms ( retrieved and reviewed my 3 years old purchase receipts ). When I call the company to ask why they charge me again, they answered they are extending my licenses to a life time, and pointing me to a corner of their homepage as of today. I said I never got these type of agreement when I purchased the software, and never want to deal with a company act like a theft.Users, be aware --- there are so many reputable softwares on the market, you don'twant invite a credit card theft to clean up your PC."
1,Detects a problem only to SELL support - expensive,I detected a virus/trojan...not Stopzilla. When I contacted their support they took control of my PC on-line and looked at this and that then pronounced that Stopzilla was working fine but I must have a virus/trojan already on board. They then proceeded to offer to fix for $209; used scare tactics; must fix NOW; must have a 'certified MS technician'. They even have a 'closer' come on line to press for immediate purchse of support. I felt like I was being mugged.I complained to Stopzilla about the tech support tactics. They never apologized or contacted me; they just cancelled my license and refunded my $39.99. They know what is going on! Don't fall for their cheap price because the technical support is only an add-on sales tactic for someone in India or Pakistan.
1,Dishonest business practices,"I installed Stopzilla after reading a review that said it was free and downloading it from their website which said it was free. After reporting that it found some Trojans, the program said I had to upgrade for $9.95 to fix them. I did this, but my credit card was charged $39.95. I called Stopzilla about the overcharge and they said they would issue a $30 refund. The refund never showed up.They also automatically signed me up for their ""customer protection"" program which will charge me $39.95 every year. I had to call to cancel that."
1,"stopzilla total ripoff scam ,con artis all the way..","A few days ago I got a virus called system tool After asking around about norten macafee etc.I was told these only prevent viruses not get rid of them once I have one. I went on line typed ""remove systemtool"" in and up poped stopzilla they scaned my pc ,found 49 bad things and for $19.95 would cure it all. I sent the 19.95 credit by card and got an authorization key which did not work,but there was a number to call in this event .After calling it I was told they needed to get into my pc to see what all was wrong ,then thery told me for $199.95 thet could make my pc like new again.I said I wanted my 19,95 back because they were just lowlife ripoffs.I also addeca few choice words you wont here in church. The guy hung up ..Be ware this is these peoples way of getting our money..Hwe was also very rude from the start,when I asked questions he kept on talking like there was a time delay ..Anyway I here with a junk pc still/"
1,Watch out for continuous credit authority,Warning. When you activate this product they will automatically take money from your credit card every year. In fact they take it at 11 months and not 12. Not giving you the option of cancelling first. And when you ry to log into your coconut to cancel the payments you can't get the portal to accept your credentials..Also the product is nt that good and slowed down my pc so much I took it off. Lon grime ago.
1,Another 3rd World Rope-A-Dope,"Trying to bail daughter's laptop out of a rouge spyware infection I stumbled across Stopzilla. Big mistake. Purchase key was invalid only to give you the opportunity to speak to a ""technician"" , who after examining system remotely identifies registry damage and offers to do a discount cleanse of $209 which is much cheaper. Screw them.Their scan didn't discover the trojan that infected the system and now I will be on look out for auto renewals, overcharges on card, etc.Serious waste of time."
1,Beware this is a scam. Do not give them your credit card!,"I bought and installed this program a year ago. When I realized it was actually spyware I uninstalled it. It was not easy to do this as the uninstall program does not work. I did not ask for my money back as I should have. I just figured shame on me for not doing my research. Today I looked at my credit card bill and found that stopzilla had automatically charged me 39.95 for a renewal. I NEVER authorized this. I called my credit card company and they are removing the charge.I have now spent some time researching this and found that I'm not the only one to have this happen to. Please believe me this is spyware!! Getting it off your pc will cost you if you don't know how to hack the registry, kill processes and delete the correct .dll files."
1,Garbage Security Software,"I just bought the Stopzilla security software.(A) It does not block Pop-Ups.(B) Now I cannot even open my AOL e-mail.I will probably have to format the hard-drive and re-install everything.This is Garbage, and I expect the other two security programs they sold me is just as destructive to my computer operations.."
1,Scam Artists,I bought a lifetime stopzilla warrentee that for some reason keeps expiring over and over again. When I call they tell me that I need to give them 199 dollars to fix my computer problems. when I tell them I do not have computer problems I have computer spyware problems they become rude and forceful insisting I need to buy their expensive product. When I become firm with them they give me a new code so I can update the spyware product again. But six months later it expires again and they take up a lot of my time trying to sell me something I dont need again. And the cycle contines...
1,STOP ZILLA DONT GO THERE,"This company are the worst worst ever. Even though you cancel the package, every year they take money from you. Please avoid them."
1,Con artists,I regret not checking the online reviews before buying this - I had to make a claim thfough paypal to get my money back. Stay away from this company
4,The Essentials of Teaching Reading 2nd edition,"Product arrived promptly and w/ free shipping. Brand new, yet had slightly bent corner (cover and about 40 sheets)."
3,Good Start to Learning More,"I found the book interesting, but sometimes I would find myself lost. I do not know French and knew very little about post war France to begin with, so I think that lead to my confusion when Roberts made cultural references. To be fair, she does explain the story lines of many of the books she uses to back up her thesis. I also enjoyed how the book is spilt up into three sections to represent the three different types of women in France in this time. (The modern woman, the mother, and the single woman). To me the section on the single woman was the most interesting and easiest to understand. I am sure that if one already has a general understanding of French/French culture, they would find the book an easier read than I did. Still it is worth checking out if you are interested in gender."
4,fantasy collection,I love Jim Henson's work but I don't understand MirrorMask. Labyrinth is good but The Dark Crystal is my favorite. It is very imaginative and cute.
5,"Wonders, magic, and Hensonvision","These three movies are extremely impressive. My son and every child, kid, and grown-up with fun inside just love these films. Jim Henson and family, company, friends, & neighbors have always been on the cutting edge of what is impossibly possible for movies. These definitely need to be in everybody's collection!"
5,This had been a birthday gift to someone a few months ago. He loves it !,Great movies. Lots of nostalgia ... my son used to watch a couple of these movies when he was much tounger. I recently gave him this set for his birthday and he loves it.
3,Star Wars meets Muppets,"I had mixed feelings aboutThe Dark Crystal. The puppet animation holds up surprisingly well even in the age of digital animation. Some of the scenes are beautiful, such as the heroes rowing on the lake with papyrus. The movements are generally smooth and not jerky. It shows Jim Henson's genius with puppets. My problem with the movie is with the human side - the script and voice acting. Sometimes, it seems the scriptwriters got lazy and just copied scenes from Star Wars, including characters suspiciously similar to the Ewoks and Yoda. Some of the voices also seem a bit weak and lighty for their characters. Finally, the movie seems to want to be an epic, and has the makings of it, but is just too short at 1.5 hours to really be of epic proportions. I'd recommendThe Dark Crystalfor kids who like fantasy/epics like Star Wars, but I don't know if it will appeal much beyond that audience."
4,Quality,"It was in perfect condition. As if I were to have gone to the store and picked it up myself, but you know, without all the walking."
4,"Labyrinth & Dark Crystal good, MirrorMask not so much.","I received this for Christmas since I am a big fan of work from Jim Henson's studios. I had seen Labyrinth and Dark Crystal, but not MirrorMask. It seemed odd to me since there was a lot of CG from the mid-2000s, and not a lot of the puppetry and animatronics, which is what I really like the most about Jim Henson's creations. It seems clear to me that this one was created after his death. I believe his daughter produced it. It wasn't a total failure, just wasn't as good as I was hoping. I still think the other two are worth the box set, though."
1,"Cut the price in half, then we'll talk",There is no benefit to buying these three movies packaged together. Buy them separately and save $$$.
4,Speckel me Green!,"Neopets: 7""Speckled Green Shoyru Plushie. This is a cute little collectible Neopet. I purchased this from a vendor on Amazon some years ago and my child still has it to this day. Please note, that this is a about 7 inches in height. I would suggest that you look at a ruler and compare the size. Overall, I would recommend this product for all those Neopet fans."
2,Didn't Like This Pouf,"I thought a shower pouf is a pouf, so I bought this whole pack. I now know that not all shower poufs are created equal. Firstly, this does not have a nice little ""yarn"" like loop thing to hang it with. They kind of made a loop out of the mesh itself and it is very thick and very hard to use. My biggest problem however is that this pouf is VERY rough. It actually turned my skin bright red. I would not recommend this pouf unless you have tough skin."
2,Product damaged on arrival,"Upon opening the box, I found that the gasket on the backside of the filter was broken and not attached around the entire circumference. This appeared to be the result of a manufacturing problem and not shipping damage. I made the decision to trim and glue the gasket back in place. It remains to be seen how effective this will be. I considered returning it, but figured that the hassle and shipping wasn't worth it. Despite my reluctance to return the this item, it was expensive enough for me to expect better quality."
4,A requirement,I'm glad that amazon still carriers these. I cannot find them anywhere else. I have 4 of these air cleaners - 2 large and 2 small - and I run them 24/7 due to asthma and allergies. I do notice a difference in my son's asthma symptoms if I do not keep them on all the time.
3,too expensive and too noisy,"Although I like this air cleaner because it does seem to filter out dirty particles, I have decided not to continue using it.1) filters are way too expensive12) the air cleaner is noisy - I turn it off when watching TV, or conversing with others in the family room.3) the air blasts out of the top of the unit -- you can feel it as you walk by; this has a chilling effect on a person as he/she walks by - especially in winter.(The smaller 4381 unit for my office, on the other hand, is quiet, efficient and more affordable!"
5,These HEPA filters also fit the Hamilton Beach Air Cleaner Model 04152,"Although it doesn't mention it, these HEPA filters also fit the Hamilton Beach Air Cleaner Model 04152. I had to email Hamilton Beach to find out, but they were very helpful and responded right away. When the filters arrived from Amazon, I saw that on the box it says ""Fits Models 04162, 04163 & 04152.""With our cat and houseful of antiques, we always seem to have dust bunnies floating around. I run this model in our office, under the table which holds the computer. Since placing it there I have noticed the buildup of dust around the modem is almost entirely eliminated. I placed the larger model in our living room and it certainly is doing its job. The regular settings can be louder than expected, but I leave them on the ""whisper quiet"" setting when we're in that room and I don't even notice them being on. I would definitely recommend the Hamilton Beach air cleaners."
4,Add $2 and get the whole machine.,"I started to purchase this replacement filter for my model 4152 air purifier but luckily decided to see what the whole machine is going for -and it was on sale for $49.99 (this was for sale at $47.99).So I bought 3 spare machines - and even if they're not running, I'll have no regret, because they contain the replacement filters. And I got free shipping as a Prime member.Next time out I'll look for washable filters because these things are expensive."
5,Hamilton Beach 04163,"Amazon asked me to review the replacement filter so I thought I'd go ahead and make some comments about the Air Cleaner itself. Prior to buying the air cleaner (must have been almost 3 years ago) I'd wake up most mornings with a runny nose. Since running this overnight for the past 3 years I very rarely ever have any stuffiness or runniness in the mornings. In fact, if someone shuts it off during the night my wife and I both notice the difference in the air in the house. I recommend this any time someone tells me about their allergies - it is one of the highest value purchases I have made - ever"
