1,Misleading,"Brita implies that with each filter purchased it ""saves"" 300 plastic bottles.The fact is that with new bottles weighing in at 8 grams or less that is a bit misleading.Each Brita filter has almost 5 ounces of plastic, not including packaging.Also Brita filters are considered contaminated so they often can not be recycled.Plastic water bottles are 100% recylable.Just something to consider the next time you watch a Brita commercial and hear ""Each Brita filter can take UP TO 300 of those (plastic) bottles out of the equation."""
2,Not working as expected,"The filters doesn't seem to filter the water,tried multiple filters ,both seem to have same issue, leaves lot of black color specks on top compartment of the filter, some times they even comes down to lower compartment and drinking water."
3,I switched to Pur. Better safe than sorry.,"I used Brita filters for a couple of years before I noticed black carbon deposits floating around in my freshly poured cup of water. They are very hard to see.I purchased my first Brita filter system for home use. I didn't notice it for a long time because I always pour into a glass. I eventually bought a second system to use at work. At work, I use a paper cup. That's when I noticed the small carbon particles. It is easier to see the particles floating around in a white cup, as opposed to glass. I tried rinsing several different filters per the Brita instructions, but it didn't help.I have switched to using Pur filters. No black carbon deposits with the Pur system.I give the Brita filters 3 stars because they do remove the chlorine smell from city water (which is why I use water filters), and they filter the water reasonably quickly. If Brita can correct this problem, I will switch back to the Brita system."
4,Improves Water Taste for Sure,"I'm not a huge water drinker, so anything that can improve the taste of my water is a plus. This doesn't make it taste perfect, but noticeably better for sure."
3,Were a good buy.,"These filters used correctly in a Brita Jug do a great job of filtering tap water.They were a terrific buy from Amazon, then they either realized they were under priced, or decided to make more profit, so they really upped the price. Now they are the same price as a lot of other sources."
2,Not Brita Filters!! But Velvet Sales and Amazon handled my complaint very well!,I purchased a 10 pack of what i thought were Brita filters from Velvet Sales. They turned out to be generic filters made to fit the Brita system. I complained to Amazon and was given an immediate return authorization and my credit card charge was quickly reversed even before I had sent the filters back. I posted a negative review of Velvet Sales and was contacted by them. They apologized and asked me to let them know how much the return shipping charges were so they could issue a refund to me. I still feel the posting is misleading and they should make it clear on the web page that these are not the Brita filters that are pictured but they acted responsibly and did the right thing. I am very satisfied with their handling of the problem and would definitely try buying from them again
5,Brita Replacement Filter,I was very pleased with the Brita Replacement Filter I ordered. It arrived sooner than the expected said date which was three days earlier! I was so happy! These filters last quite a long time!
5,economical,"This is the best way to purchase your Brita filters! It is way cheaper then buying one or two at a time, and they don't go bad! The box is slim, so storage is pretty easy. I definitely recommend purchasing the 10 pack!"
5,Great Water,We've been using Brita pitchers and filters for at least 10 years and they do a great job. You can definitly tell when the filter needs to be replaced due to the taste not being as good.
5,EXCELLENT,Took the filter out to see if the family noticed the difference. The results were immediate.....They couldnt drink the water. The filters are a must in our house
4,Brita Water Filters,"The product is good, the price is also ok BUT........ when you add the shipping, its no better than retail. I've order them twice on Amazon but won't again unless Amazon lowers its price to be competitive after shipping with retail."
4,Brita dispenser,"This is my 2nd Brita dispenser. The 1st one cracked while inserting a filter after 8 years use. We use the pitcher for coffee water, because it doesn't clog the coffee maker and the coffee tastes better than w/our tap water.I like the new one a little better because it seals the water from slopping out when I transfer a full container of water to the refrigerator."
1,nicole,"I've been using brita for about 2 years now. Filters have never been a problem bu with this pack of 4 the water has been tasting like chlorine, tap water, and sludge. The water goes through the filter too quickly and I think this is what's causing the water not to be filtered. Brita doesn't even have a recall and I have no way to send it back and get filters manufactured from a different batch. Very disappointed."
1,What Happened?!,"Yuck!! I've been using these for years, but this last batch makes my water taste bitter and undrinkable. I was very surprised and tasted my tap water,..........it was a million times better straight out of the tap than what this batch of brita filters did to it. I thought I'd just gotten a bad one, so went ahead and opened a second filter, it did the same thing. I have no idea what's going on with the filters. I checked and don't see a recall notice for them. Blech, I'm still trying to wipe the taste off of my tongue!"
4,Filterin' Fun!,"Ok...so its not really fun. Actually, it's quite boring waiting for your water to pass through the filter.These Brita filters arrived pretty quickly.You get 5 for a great price on Amazon. Although, I did notice Walmart can sometimes have them cheaper when on sale. But it is hit or miss.I usually replace my filter every 3 months, so I should be good for another year with this pack.I even keep an extra smaller 5 cup pitcher that I got at Walmart for $10 bucks (with a filter).The reason I gave these filters 4 stars is because when I opened the one it had the black charcoal specks all over in the wrapper. I never had this problem before. It still seemed fine and I am of course going to use it but I thought it was worth mentioning. Maybe I just got a strange batch.I recommend buying these filters from Amazon for their great price!"
4,What can I say,Produces tasty water. Four starts because it doesn't remove fluoride!! Release a filter that removes fluoride and I'll improve the star rating.
4,good price for multiple pack,"checked local retailers and this was better price, the multiple pack was good deal, shipped very quickly and will order more when needed"
2,It works but...,The one that originally came with the unit was better. These fall out of place easier when pouring and have more little chunks of charcoal that float out through the top when filling the reservoir. You'd think it would all be the same thing but evidently not. Still filters the water though...
1,Filter full of ANTS,"I've been using filters (mostly another popular brand) for the better part of 20 years, but this was my first experience buying replacements from Amazon. I opened one of the filters this evening, read the directions, and soaked it in a clean measuring cup.After 15-20 minutes, I poured out the soaking water, rinsed off the filter, and set about replacing our old filter. I poured the water out of the old pitcher, tossed the old filter, and put the new one in. I filled the pitcher with water, and started noticing little specks in the water. I thought it was carbon and thought nothing of it. Then I looked closer and realized the specks were ANTS, loads of ANTS.I poured the ant-y water out, took the filter out and rinsed it, only to have more ants come crawling out. The filters are now quarantined in the garage and will be returned ASAP."
5,Brita Pitcher Replacement Water Filter Cartridges,My Brita Pitcher needed replacement Water Filter Cartridges and ordering them online saved me from going to a store to purchase them. I am very pleased with my purchase and it was received very promptly.
4,"It's good, but wish it was fresher","Brita 35516 5 Count Brita Pitcher Filters Purchased from Good Buy NY. 5 pack filters for our Brita. They seem to be fine, but the one I just opened is very dry. This is the first time that I have had a ""dry"" filter with the carbon falling out of it. They are usually very moist. Gave it 4 stars for losing losts of its carbon in the packaging due to it being so dry.However, after soaking it for a few hours it seems to be fine. I hope it lasts as long as my others do."
3,good product,good product for best results need to soak in water to work goodgood price no black specs in water
5,brita pitcher filters,not much to say except it works.. clean great tasting water.. and with a recommended change every 3 months.. I got a whole years supply for a great price..
4,Brita water filter cartridges,I have been using the Brita cartridges with my new Brita water pitcher purchased through Amazon.com since before Christmas. They work very well and provide fresh clean water for my new Keurig coffee maker. I recommend them to anyone who likes a fresh tasting cup of coffee!
5,Brita Replacement Filter,The replacement filter did its job.....the price was good. I received it in good time since it was part of a gift!
5,what a bargain...,i pay less per filter when i buy a 4-pack which is very convenient and cost-effective... and more Brita for me!
5,Good value,"Brita filters have been around for as long as I can remember. This is for a reason: they do their job. I can't assess their ability to remove contaminants with no taste (like bacteria and heavy metals), but I can tell you that they improve the taste of tap water remarkably. This site has a better price on them than any of my local stores, so I order here."
5,great filters,"i have been using these filters for year and i love them. they make the water taste great and last a very very long time. unlike some people who use this water for only cooking purposes ,i drink this water and love it. the filters last a very very long time and its a great purchase. it saves you a lot of money vs having to buy water"
3,These surprised me.,"I've used Brita pitchers off and on for years, whenever I've had smelly, chemical-filled water. I've never had a problem with them in the past. But for some reason, the filters that I recently ordered were a bit too small. There was a gap between the filter and the space they occupy in the pitcher reservoir, so the water was just flowing through without actually being filtered. I'm returning the filters to Amazon. I also contacted Brita about the issue, giving them the batch number printed on the boxes, but haven't heard anything back from them. I'll try to remember to come update my review if I do hear anything back from them. I did find some off-brand filters made to fit Brita pitchers:Mavea 1007930 Classic Fit 2-Pack Replacement Filter. They fit very well and I love they don't require the pre-soak, plus the price is great, so I'll probably buy those as long as they're available."
5,brita filters,they're your typical brita filter. got a three-pack for about five bucks cheaper than it usually retails. great buy
4,Just as Expected,I received the item in a timely manner. It was just what I wanted. Plus the free shipping was good.
2,This is bad pricing,"You get it at $42 at Costco. While you are there, you can also grab yourself 25 lb. of tortilla chips and 3 gallons of Salsa."
2,bad product!,"Okay - there's something wrong with Brita filters. They don't always fit into the pitchers - when I tilt the pitcher I can hear the filter shifting inside - and yes, I am aligning it properly. It may filter out impurities contained in the tap water, but only to replace them with thick black carbon particles. I've followed all the instructions and replace the filters every second month, but darned if there isn't a problem with every single one! Don't buy this - look for another alternative!"
1,Very delayed shipping!!!,"I ordered these Brita filters and was given the impression that they were to be shipped within a week. Then I get a back order message but can't cancel it because it was in the, ""processing phase."" I will never order anything from Target online and wouldn't recommend them to anyone! They are dishonest and unethical about a consumer's right to cancel an order that was screwed up early in the processing stage."
1,Did Not Receive Them,"Brita filter pitchers and filters are great. We use them all the time to improve our drinking water for coffee and tea.However, we did not receive the Brita Filters that were ordered. There was a mix-up in the type of shipping used and the US Post Office sent them back as undeliverable.Amazon Customer Service said they would give us a FULL refund, including shipping charges, since their vendor selected the shipment method, but a week later, sent a message saying they were holding back shipping charges because we returned the product. NO RESPONSE from Customer Service since."
1,SLIM SHOTS,"Tastes great but doesn't work!Just the same old, same old new weight loss product hype.I won't waste anymore $$ on this item.Lisa"
1,Arrived in an open box,"When I received this item, it arrived in an already opened package. I expect more from Amazon."
1,they feel more like fake brita than real ones,"Water is filtered in less than 10 seconds, without any observable gap between the pitcher and the filter. It tastes like tap water. Very different from the store bought ones. It seems like the filtering particles they use are different. I wonder if they are counterfeits."
3,"At this price, just buy another Brita Slim Pitcher","Since the Brita Slim Pitcher is only $7.99 and includes a filter, you're better off just buying another pitcher."
1,Product description off base,I was looking specifically for Brita filters that filter out Lead. The product review stated twice that this model removed Lead. When I recieved the package the side panel didn't mention anything about removing Lead. I returned it to Amazon and won't buy filters from Amazon anymore.
2,Are these fresh filters?,"I received the filters promptly but the first filter I used left the water black. Brita filters I have purchased in the past did not do this. I began to wonder if the filter was too old but did not see any expiration or ""use by"" dates on the product."
2,not filtering correctly,"I've bought these filters for years, but the last batch (bought on amazon) are no good -- a lot of carbon particles in the bottom of the pitcher each time I refill it, and the water runs through much too fast. No appreciable difference in taste when compared with regular tap water. I am hoping this is just a bad batch and they haven't changed suppliers/factories/manufacturing standards."
4,"It's a water filter, it does what it's expected to do.","These remove any trace of odd flavor from my tap water. My only gripe is that sometimes carbon from the filter gets into the water. You can still drink it, it just has little black bits in it."
1,Micron rating of filter cartridge,"I noticed that the Brita cartridges did not take out a lot of color from the water I put in. Later I found out that it was rated Class 5 on NSF's scale - by looking up the NSF site, Class 5 means 85% reduction of particles between 30 to 50 microns. The scale is a 6-step scale with Class 1 being the best. After checking with the Greater Vancouver Water District, our sediment particle size in the water averages 2.5 microns - No wonder the water coming through the cartridges is still yellowish brown in color!"
1,Old filters,First of all the package of Brita filters is advertised as a box of 10--I received two boxes of 5 which were already open and the boxes were old and flimsy. The filters themselves seem to be dried out because a lot of the black carbon is on the outside of the filter. I already had a new filter in my pitcher so I have not actually used one of the filters yet but I'm skeptical if they are going to filter out anything at all. I was not happy with this purchase at all!P. S. I accidentally clicked on one star and was not able to change it or there would be no stars at all.
1,Very dissapointed,"Very disappointed,Very disappointed. The 10 pk was actually two 5 pk. One of the boxes was open when I received. When I opened the one filter, the blue granular pieces were all over the filter and inside of the bag. In addition, it has blue stains on the filter. I never saw any filters like this before and was wondering if it is used or it has expired. So I wrote an email to the seller - ClaudiaOutlet. But never heard back from them. It's a waste time and money buy.I checked the seller on Amazon.com, but couldn't find it anymore. Hope it went out of the business. Just afraid that it has changed its name to continue selling their defected products, be aware!"
1,Lots of carbon particles,"They are not good any more, seems the manufacture change the filter design in recent years. I bought 5 filters pack, and 4 of them gave me a lot of carbon particles in filtered water, from the first day of usage. I have to discard at least 1/4 of water in each glass to prevent eating those free bonus Brita provided.Goodbye, Brita, I will swich to Pur, although it is quite slow. Clorox, you destroyed Brita, Burt Bee, what is your next acquisition target?"
4,If you've come to Amazon to look at this buy it here,"This is good stuff, the filters work for upto a couple of months to three , it says upto 40 gallons but am not sure if it goes till that but then I am not sure how much water I drink in that time.The water filtered by this is good - tasteless odorless. The price for these is the best on Amazon."
4,Brita Pitcher Replacement Filter,"The carbon particles which come off the filter is a little bothersome. However, it probably does not hurt anything, since it is carbon and I have not noticed it in the finished product, only in the top part of pitcher before it is filtered. It is a little annoying though. I would give it 5 stars, if not for that. It does make the water taste a lot better after the filtration."
3,"Ordinarily would give 5 stars, but...","Nov. 2012: I've used these filters in the Brita pitcher for years, and the filtered water tastes much better than local water, which has high chemical taste. However, the last two filters have run the water through at high speed - very different from usual slow filtering. I actually threw away a filter thinking it was faulty, but the next one from same package did the same thing. The filters aren't cheap, and I'm wondering about checking with the company about this. First I'd like to know if anyone else has had this problem recently. (I see there were some complaints of this in 2010). Thanks for any replies."
3,Brita filters,"So far they are working ok, they just release a small black pieces from the container but they don't fall to the pitch, they remain at the top of the brita. It's not the normal working, I mean, this pieces are released only at the beginning of the normal working process. The taste is totally different."
4,gattumahesh,"It is good, took some more days time to ship, but the product Brita water filter i like it.Found the price also good."
5,"Brita 42432 Replacement Filters,4 pack","If you are buying replacement filters ,you really already know how good these work. These filters would make swamp water taste good...but I use mine in Louisiana where the city water ,while safe to drink, has been used by all the people up-stream and I feel better PLUS the water tastes so much better with my Brita Pitcher and these replacement filters.I even gave one to my good friend Bubba,who drinks water dipped from the lake...and with this filter ,he says ,the water tastes good and he doesn't get bugs or sticks in his teeth. Now that is a good thing."
4,Tasty water,"If you want your water filtered and to have a good taste, go no further. No need for bottled water, this is much more cost efficient."
3,Not as good as I used to got.,"From the package, I can't see any difference from this one and the one I used to got. But the water just does not tast as it used to be. After using it for 2 weeks, my water still smells carbon. And sometimes I even had to dump away my food after using the water for cooking. And I now using water directly from the tap, leaving those unused filters alone."
3,Not like all others,A lot of black bits release into the carafe. Moreso than ones I previously used. Curious if the are from a second party manufacturer. ??
3,Pricing unsatisfactory,Why does it cost more per unit when buying a 6-pack of refill filters than it costs for a 4-pack or 5-pack? We're saving packaging and shipping yet they're charging more. The Brita company and Amazon should reward customers who buy in bulk and save on materials and energy.
4,Great price,Must have at home...super fresh water...great price...I would definitely recommend....sure beats buying cases of water at supermarket and the environment will thank you as well
4,good deal,I've used the britta and filters for years. This was a good buy. Usually only get 3 to a pack.
4,Tried and True,Product came very quickly and with a good price. I'll be glad to purchase from source again and would recommend to others.
5,Necessary item,"If you have and use a Brita, you periodically have to change the filter. Why not order 4 at a time?"
1,"good product, but too expensive at $19.17 for 3 filters","I thought this contained 10 filters. This impression was from others' reviews (e.g. a review on Feb 10 by Corvallis, OR mentions this is 10-pack) as well as the package image that showed 10 filters (this image is now nonexistent but was there about a week ago when I ordered it). At Target, you can get 6 filters for $27. I love this product, but will definitely buy somewhere else next time."
5,great improvement,i love the new feature . it makes it easier to know when to replace the filters. one less thing to keep track of!
2,What's with the Black Particles???,"The water certainly tastes great and you can find these just about anywhere. Also, they are easy to change and the pitchers are well-designed. But, what's with the black particles? (Either carbon or coal?) They are frequently in the draining basin, but if you attempt to pour water while this basin still has any amount of water in it, you can get these in your glass. I don't understand why this is so difficult to fix but it doesn't seem from other reviews that Brita is too interested in doing so."
2,Okay - if one isn't wasted,"I've used Brita for years and didn't want to change to another system. I was very disappointed that one of these filters was so defective that I threw it away unused. It ""leaked"" so much carbon that the soaking time made the water black. I can't believe there would have been enough in the filter to filter the water, so I threw it away and started a second one. It's only a bargain if you can use all the filters. This is the second time that has happened, though the first time was NOT this seller, so I may reconsider changing to another system now."
3,Receieved somewhat quickly,"Received 5 Brita filters and the first one is performing just fine. I was disapointed when I learned that I could have purchased the same 5 pack at K-Mart for the same price. However, I am mostly satisfied."
5,Very nice deal here,"Such a good idea to buy this from Amazon, the average price is so much lower than in places like Walmart."
5,Briat Pitcher filters,Have used Brita Water pitcher for years. Can hardly tolerate drinking any water that has not been filtered. These are good cartridges and last about a month if the pitcher is filled once per day.
3,"Definitely works, but little bits of something keep floating up into the reservior.","PROS: Works as advertised, makes Baltimore water taste way better.CONS: Every time I open the reservoir, I see what looks like pepper.FINAL VERDICT: Don't have much of a choice when it comes to what filter you want to put in your Brita.SUMMARY: As mentioned above in Cons, the filter appears to be causing backwash. Note, this is not going into what I drink, the other way around. When I fill it up with water, there is a top half (reservoir) that slowly allows water to flow through the filter and down into the bottom half. It's the reservoir that is filling up inexplicably with this stuff. I rinse it out and it keeps coming. But as long as it doesn't get into my drink, I suppose I can't complain. Just not too appetizing."
5,Fast Delivery!!!!,"I bought these Brita filters online, because they are way cheaper even with shipping than buying them at a store. The filter has worked great so far!!! I am very pleased and especially pleased with how fast the items were shipped. I would buy anything from this seller!!!!!!!"
2,Not sure if these filters are good,"Already getting a ""Change Filter"" warning on my pitcher, one week in. So I'm not quite sure what I received was a box of brand new filters, or if it's been sitting on a shelf somewhere for years."
4,Just like the ones in the stores,"Just like the ones I usually pay a little bit more for in the stores. Beats the price and waste of bottled water, and does a good job changing the taste of city water."
5,Good for filtering water,"Tap water tastes better after filtering it, I guess. I heard something about using water filters to lower the alcohol volume of vodka, though I'm personally not interested in verifying."
2,wrong size,"I ordered these filters thinking that they matched by pitcher,they didn't. I used them anyway because I need the filtered water. The filter doesn't fit down completely in the pitcher."
1,Filter doesn't fit,"I received the Brita filter as a wedding gift. To my surprise, the filter does not fit. The water just runs around the filter into the pitcher which defeats the purpose. I am very disappointed."
1,too late,"I orderd this item on sept. 7th, and finally got it on Oct.1th. What a speed!Do not trust this shop anymore."
2,Taste Fine.,Taste fine but just a pain to fill over and over. I am doing this just for me and my dog so if you have a family this is not the way for you to go.
2,filters are fine; vendor is not,"So I thought I'd save myself a trip to Costco and order these online. A week after the order, they still haven't even shipped. But of course they are ""preparing to be shipped"" so I can't cancel the order.Lesson learned: next time I'll get in the car and go to the store like an old analog person..."
5,Excellent Service,We received the mdse very quickly - the order was correctly filled and arrived in good shape.
3,Looked used!,Came in a box that looked mangled... like it had been sitting in a closet for a long time and got trashed. One of the filters doesn't seem to be letting the water thru like normal either...
4,Replacement Filters,Not much to review here. I did find this filter to be a perfect fit to the old Brita pitcher which I no longer used because the filters (number obsolete) were hard to locate. Glad I saved and bought a 10-pack for my new pitcher and now have two working pitchers for different locations.
5,Brita filter cartridges,"The Brita pitcher and filters are great! I used to use Pur, and it drove me nuts. The filter wore out quickly and took forever to filter the water into the pitcher. The Brita filter is fast and lasts much longer before needing to be replaced."
3,expensive filtration,"I feel these Brita filters are overpriced for what you get. No matter where you buy them, be it in the stores or online, the price is too high thanks to the Brita Company."
5,Best price I have found for Brita filters,"I have been using Brita filtered water for years. 2 of my pitchers are at least 7 years old. The filters are still the same size. Some manufacturerschange the design of their filters, forcing you to buy a new pitcher but I have never seen Brita filters change in the ten years I have used them.This 10 pack of filters is the cheapest price I have seen online or in stores including Sam's."
1,Poor quality filter,"I recently purchased both a birta and a pur single stage filter (and a pitcher each). The taste of water from both the filters seems to be comparable.However, the filtered water from brita filter contains a lot of fine black particles(my guess is that they are charcoal particles). I followed the instructions closely which suggested soaking/flushing the filter initially. Initially, when I saw the charcoal particles, I thought that they would disappear after I have used the filter for few days. This is not the case and I still see black particles in water after 15 days of regular usage. I think the quality of brita is inferior to pur filters and would not recommend buying brita."
1,don't buy this item from Amazon,This was my first time buying Brita water filter's from Amazon. I have bought numerous items (from tea to textbooks)for many years from Amazon and this is the first time that I wanted to return an item. I did not open the water filters until the return window roughly 6 weeks) had closed. All 3 water filters were ruined. The black filtering particles somehow escaped from their packaging. Usually there are a few in the individual wrappers. But this time in each three filters around a teaspoon had leaked out.Long story short DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM OFF OF AMAZON!!!! Buy it from a local store with a better return policy
1,Damaged Goods,"I usually buy this item at the store and they are fine and clean.These arrived damaged, dirty and full of particles."
1,Store brand work better,Bought this to replace the one that came witht he pitcher and they suck. Buy the store brand *Target a lot cheaper and work much better.
1,Leaking black particles of all sizes,"Not sure about the purification quality, but this filter leaks black particles of all sizes. It is just a mess to clean them up even if one ignores their health effect. Finally, after some web research I threw away unused 4 packs into the trash when my concern over these unidentified objects outweigh the taste of water. I find it inexcusable for Brita to ignore earlier customer complaints and continue to sell this product."
5,healthy and clean water,"I heard that it's much healthier to drink filter water. With all the bleach they put in the water now it's not a good idea to drink tap water. I have used Brita filters for many years and they work great. If there are any toxins in the water, it will be filtered out with Brita filters. The only negative thing about this product is it's expensive, but if it is good for your health. I am willing to pay."
5,Better Pricing!,Much better pricing then where I was buying just a two pack at a local store. This is where I'm going to buy my filters from now on.
4,Decent filter,"These are decent filters especially for those on city water. If you have a spring or well there is not much that these can do. They do not filter out lead, fluoride, or microbes so be aware."
4,good quality but high price,"actually I do not know if it is good or not because it is the only product I used. However, it is delicate and convenient, and the water tastes good. The only thing I don't like maybe is its price is a little high"
1,Not a fan of the American DIC Version!,Sailor Moon is a cartoons for young teenage girls for ages 15+ in Japan. In america they rate it 7+ cause they take so many parts out. The japanesse Version is more for older kids and i prefer it in japannese then Dubbed. Once you get to the 3rd and 4th season the dubbing gets alot better. So if you love uncut sailor moon go out and buy season2 uncut!
4,An important film - captivating,"A hole in a fence grants us a captivating view into Red Hook. It is a snapshot of this Brooklyn neighborhood at a time when so much is changing in its make-up. The film maker chose wonderfully eclectic characters and obviously has a real knack for making them feel comfortable in front of a camera. Their responses are candid and bring depth to the film. I also greatly appreciate that the film does not attempt to overreach and feed the audience a pre-chewed meal, instead it does what worth while pieces of art often do: it asks important questions."
5,The best book I read in 1997!,I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It made me sad and made me laugh- what a good book! Clutie Mae is quite the character and her story is unique
5,"Wonderful, Informative essays","Beautifully written essays that illustrate the problems of the Holy Lands frankly and passionately. Oz brings me my first real understanding of both sides of the struggle in Israel. He succeeds with the clarity that has alluded most news teams, and does it in a way that degrades no one. As always Oz's writing, is remarkable."
2,just one song ??? and no music video ???,just one song ??? and no music video ??? for $10.49 ??? no wonder amazon's profits are skyrocketing. the song and video are great. they should both be together for this price.
5,A witty account of the background of Shakespeare's Hamlet.,This three-part work combines the ancient legends to present a convincing psychological portrait of the lives of the royal family up to the outset of Shakespeare's play. In the process it offers stunning insights into the play itself. Another Updike tour de force.
4,Gertrude And Claudius,"The book is an interesting attempt to supply the background material, or the prologue to Shakespeare's play Hamlet. It is the history of the marriage between Queen Gertrude and King Hamlet, Prince Hamlet's parents; the adultery between Queen Gertrude and Claudius, King Hamlet's brother; the murder of King Hamlet; and, why Prince Hamlet had returned to Elsinore from Wittenberg prior to his encounter with the ghost of King Hamlet. The book ends where Shakespeare's play Hamlet begins - probably because the author assumes the reader knows what happens in the end of the play. The book is well-written and I enjoyed reading it."
4,A novel that offers a refreshing diversion,"Gertrude and Claudius as a novel is sheer entertainment. Given that everyone knows the Shakespeare Hamlet, with so many movie versions cropping up yearly, it is a pleasure to see a contemporary writer of the stature of Updike apply the bard's techniques of story telling to introduce the dysfunctional family Hamlet ultimately destroys. If Updike is tedious at the outset of this novel - who in their sane mind wants to wade through the mire of Danish myth/history replete with irritating name changes, period language, etc - once his tenor is set he takes us on a rather winsome journey of royalty, class, passion, adultery, murder and courtplotting that makes for a page-turner of a novel.In the end, I think Updike's novel, for all its meanderings, gives us a broader vista of why Hamlet is so troubled when the curtain opens on Shakespeare's play. There are insights here worth pondering. This is a great little book for an evening's diversion."
2,"Interesting premise, badly executed","So how did Hamlet get to be the Melancholy Prince? John Updike explores the events leading to the start of Shakespeare's best-known play, starting with Gertrude's arranged marriage to Hamlet's father and following into her affair with the man who becomes Claudius. Hamlet (alternately known as Ambleth or Hamblet--depending on what part of the book you're in, Updike changes the spelling of the characters names, a device obviously intended to be clever that just becomes annoying after a while) is rarely seen, but discussed quite frequently. Updike, unfortunately for the casual reader, is the type of literary writer that believes where one sentence could be sufficient, three pages would be even better, and Gertrude/Gerutha/Geruthe's story gets lost in all the convoluted, lofty language. Shakespeare fans will either love it or loathe it, but unless you want to be lulled to sleep on your blanket, it's not a beach read."
3,Shakespeare Remembered,"Browsing library shelves I became intrigued by the word ""prequel"" inside the cover page. Still, not being a fan of Shakespeare, nor having read the book reviews, I thoroughly enjoyed the story with my own recollections of high school Shakespeare. Mostly enjoyed the author's writing style."
1,the book group made me read it,"I could not wait to finish this book ordeal! . Flat characters that never develop. The author assumes of the readers a profound knowledge of Shakespeare. He then turns this knowledge in to a tounge and cheek article worthy of the magazine ""true confessions"".Rich and descriptive prose like a dinner of sweet whipped cream!"
1,Not really my type of thing....,"This was an extra credit option in lit class, and if it hadn't of been for the 15 points on my grade I would have refrained from bringing this book near me at all. John Updike starts out slow and never gets out of the far right lane. There is some pretty cool imagery in this book, but if you are looking for something fast paced, or even remotely exciting don't look here. My suggestion, go rent the latest version of Hamlet and enjoy the sword fight and the other drama."
3,Sometimes Bravura Isn't Enough,"I was disappointed in this combination of HAMLET and John Updike. God knows, the language is enviably beautiful. Some of the sentences are so exquisitely crafted, they're like a mini writing-course in and of themselves, simultaneously an incitement to better writing and a discouragement that one will ever write as well. Rhythm, metaphor, irony, perception -- they're all there.But ultimately, what you have here is artifice, rather than true art. The core is lacking -- a double disappointment given how deep HAMLET is."
5,"Honk if you're an Updike, Hamlet, Shakespeare lover",Extremely good. Very readable. Wonderful extention of the play experience. Male/female relationship insights and unique perspectives abound.
3,"Good read, but nothing special","Gertrude and Claudius is a good book. It serves its purpose as a prequel to Hamlet and the actions and motivations of the characters are as good as any I might have come up with myself. It was a different perspective than Hamlet, and that was worthwhile. Seeing Gertrude and Claudius as human beings and not just shadows in Hamlet's life was very interesting."
2,Good and bad; the bad does it in,"As single issues, the comics that make up The Kingdom"" were fairly good, some better than others. As a collection, they don't work very well together.The storytelling is very patchy. The beginning gives a great set-up: the creation of Gog, the birth of Superman and Wonder Woman's child, the deaths of multiple Supermen, the appearance of the Linear Men, and the reappearance of many supporting characters from Kingdom Come. The middle of the book, however, breaks the flow by setting aside this storyline and focusing waaaaaaay too much on a select few supporting characters, even one who wasn't IN Kingdom Come. By the end of the book, when the original storyline resumes, you'll be hard-put to still be interested in what's happening, and the horrible art in the last chapter was an insult to Jerry Ordway's and Ariel Olivetti's beautiful work in the beginning."
1,Very Poorly written Book,Largely because here we are introduced to a concept caled Hyper-time. A new way for DC to bring back it;s alternate Earths which were destroyed in Crises.I don't know what DC was trying to do here. First they destroyed their universe in Zero Hour and now the Kingdom was a way of scattering the pieces.
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A little of a story about Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and a child. Gog and Magog, and all that sort of thing. A lot of sidetracking to use some other characters and points of view. This is also partly a continuity fudging, apologist and essay about self contained stories versus the soap opera aspect of comics. He throws in the whole Hyper-Time thing to talk about this."
4,The Kingdom has come home.,"Space and time dance a merry little jig when time-travelling lunatic, Gog, murders Superman over and over, every day.The sequel to Kingdom Come, Kingdom opens with Gog's origin, and follows both Gog's madness and the lives of some of Kingdom Come's minor characters. The books are well-written and interesting, though the art sometimes falters (most visibly so when, over the course of three panels, a woman changes bra sizes each time). Unfortunately, Alex Ross was not part of Kingdom, and the work suffers for lack of his touch. Interesting ideas (i.e. Magog actually being Superman and Wonder Woman's child) are raised without resolution, and Gog's secret masters have no noticable goals."
2,Let's be honest here......,".....really the only reason you want this is for the appearance of Earth-2 Superman pounding on the mysterious wall.......because you were a little late looking for the back issue and now this is the only way to get it.Right?Everything else about this series is bunk. Hypertime?? Really?Still, I can't begrudge you for wanting it. That Superman thing IS kinda important."
2,Mark Waid should go to hell for this.,"Kingdom Come was one of the best stories ever and had the potential for a lot of great follow ups but is completely ruined by the Kingdom. Why did Mark Waid think that this was the way to follow up Kingdom Come? There were too many mistakes here to be believed, the story was bad, the art was bad, and all it served was to create a plot device that completely undo's Crisis and is sure to be an even bigger mistake in the future. It also screws up Alex Ross's character designs. Batman doesn't wear his helmet in the final part, why do we want to see an old man in Bat-armor. The Flash's look is reduced to the regular custume with Jay Garrick's Helmet (why, why, why!!!?). In it's defense the filler stories showcasing the Kingdom Come characters decent, enjoyable stories with good art exploring the Kingdom Come future, which is what a KC sequel should have been about. But these aren't enough to forgive Waid and to ever just his writing again."
4,It's like hanging out with your frineds.,"I found this film in the video store and rented it without knowing anything about it. It ended up being one of the most entertaining films I've seen in a while. At first you might think the film is slow and not that entertaining, but that's because the film is about real life and real life just isn't always interesting. The movie just progressively gets better and better and you can't help but laugh and compare the characters to your own friends.At the very least I recommend you rent the film, but I say help support independent filmmakers and pick this movie up. It's better than anything you'll find in the theaters. This is the way movies should be done."
2,"Ajay Naidu offers another wonderful, natural performance.","My only reason for wanting to see this film is because Ajay Naidu is in it. Mr. Naidu offers another wonderful performance. He plays a character that would be a best friend to any good man. He plays ""Sanjay"" who works in a stuffing envelopes business until one day he is fired for making too many mistakes. He is single and lives with his mom. This character much unlike Ajay Naidu himself has played such a wide range of characters in many films already, why he is not getting bigger lead roles in major motion pictures is beyond me. This character Mr. Naidu plays in You Are Here* as an easygoing man is a natural for him. The DVD version contains ten deleted scenes available in the ""special features"" category. The Director's Audio Commentary is good for new film makers to hear."
5,"Randall Jaynes, the next Nick Cage","When someone pops out of a movie and stares you in the face with a performance that you can't shake off, you better let other people know...watch out for hot Randall Jaynes. He plays Jason in You Are Here and he is rock solid. He plays a card that is like that wacky best friend who is let's just say, semi-deranged (an all too close attachment to a discarded items like vinyl couches and babydolls) but totally endearing...You want him around just to make you feel like YOU are maybe kind of normal. It doesnt hurt that the rest of the cast is amazing too. The movie is a tender slice of life that some of us may know too darn well. If not you'll get to catch a glimmer of those who ( for the time being atleast) choose to ""live by default."""
4,Want to design a Cisco Internetwork? This book is for you,"Full of some very usefull case studies, this book has good approach towards network design. As a candidate for CCNP, I used this book to get some additional knowledge, from a practical point of view."
4,Good Book - but not study material,"This is definately not a book to use to study for your CCIE, but it contains an amazing amount of information on a wealth of different topics from Routing protocols(including BGP4), APPN, SNA, ATM, Multicast, etc. It will sit on my desk as a great reference."
1,horrible quality!,"Did not like the quality at all.... fits ok, not what i expected! Would not be worth to return it due to all the return fees and shipping cost."
1,Did not fit,"Did not fit, had to return it. Return was easy, and received order in a timely fashion. Material was very thick and was afraid it would be too much underneath my wedding dress."
5,"Great service, great product","I love this bra, it's going to make my wedding so much more comfortable. I was happy with the service I received. At first they didn't have the color I wanted. They gave me the choice of waiting for it to come in or ordering another color. I chose to wait but it wasn't very long. The quality of the product is wonderful. No painful wires or boning to make it uncomfortable but strong enough to do its job."
3,Incomplete,"While this does have some of the very best of Alan Parsons Project, I feel it is incomplete without any music from Tales Of Mystery And Imagination - Edgar Allen Poe. While I won't condemn this collection, I can't give it 5 stars, either. If you're new to Alan Parsons and looking for a general overview of his style, this is not a bad place to start. And if you decide to get Tales Of Mystery And Imagination - Edgar Allen Poe, be careful - get the original version with the dark green cover. It has more guitar and also narration from Orson Welles."
1,Not Worth The Bottle They Put It In...,"This stuff is worthless...and thats without even knowing if the chemical makeup of it can even keep your pipes from blueing.You'll never get far enough to find out and here's why. This stuff has the viscosity of water and a longer cure time than concrete.Per the instructions: Cap off the ends of your pipes, pour in the liquid, rotate the pipe around to coat the inside, remove the caps, hang the pipes with the filler end down. GRAVITY WINS EVERYTIME!!!!!!. Long before this stuff is even close to dry it has completely ran out of your pipes...DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
1,Ripped Off,"This was bad. The fact that I paid 49 bucks made it even worst. As another reviewer said, if it was free it would have been overpriced.It doesn't teach you anything. You bring up files from a project the author had done and he gives you half ass explainations of how he did it. Most of the time he has left out critical information that would have allowed you to recreate the file.I did learn something about Flash, only because I went to many other sources to try to figure out what should have been spelled out by the author in this book.Don't buy this book !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible","A complete waste of money. On page 77 it leaves you hanging with an unfinished and pointless project, the file on the CD ROM to which it refers in non-existent, and the lesson ends abruptly with nothing accomplished. Fast forwarding to other sections, I find the same to be true. I suggest avoiding books by William B. Sanders forever."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"Being a complete novice, I figured this book would be a good way to get initiated into the world of Flash MX. Unfortunately, much like others who have reviewed the book, I found out the hard way that buying this book was certainly not the route to take. It is simply a step-by-step guide to making a silly flash project that doesn't even utilize Flash's more interesting tools. On top of this, it has glaring omissions and vague wording that make following the steps extremely frustrating and difficult. I would suggest to those just getting into Flash MX, trying ""Flash MX 2004 Demystified"" by Bucknell, Hogg, and Swann and by all means AVOID this book."
4,Very funny,"Although it's funnier when you understand Mormons and their lifestyles, but it is still funny no matter who watches it."
1,"Worst movie I've ever seen. Razzie, anyone?","If I could give this no stars, I would! The person from Kearns, UT who thinks this movie would be great for non-mormons, think again! I inadvertantly rented it at the video store, thinking it would be funny. In unbiased hands, it could have been. Skilled writers and actors would have been a plus, too. The acting was awful. The dialogue was stilted. The plot was unbelievable. Apparently the writers have never even watched a TV crime show, let alone done research. This movie played out like it was hastily thrown together by a couple of college kids pulling an all-nighter for film class. Worst of all, the whole thing came across as a thinly-veiled proselytizing tool. It may be A+ entertainment for mormons, but for regular folk like me this was nowhere near the quality one would expect."
2,"Afterwards, I wish I'd kept my money.","Chip Brown is a thorough writer. Perhaps providing too much commentary on an already confusing subject. I was hoping for some unbiased journalism on a notoriously subjective topic. Instead, Brown only nods politely in the direction of objectivity as he jumps headlong into the metaphysical and drags the reader down with him. Although he takes us through the time and space of his life, ultimately we arrive where we began - more confused than ever and wondering how such a professional journalist could ever really conclude that extraterrestrials had implanted a ""bug"" behind the right eye of his ethereal body."
4,very informative but...,"I really enjoyed chip brown's new book,and I can thoroughly recomend it to anyone who is just a teensy weensy bit sceptical about many aspects of the the health and healing industries. If anyone would like to know the real cause of most common illnesses,have a quick look at my home page;www.geocities.com/broadway/orchestra/3086"
5,great mixture of blues & rockabilly,"This is a great CD, with a fantastic mixture of driving blues and cool rockabilly sound. great guitar, great voice, great songs ..."
4,Definately shows improvement,"I damaged my hair years ago from highlights and its taking me a long time to get rid of the damage. I was skeptical but I have noticed more growth. Lets say I dye it ever month, with this I need it within 3 weeks. I worried about it being kind of expensive for such a small bottle but it goes a long way. I washed first with another shampoo and when I used this I only used a little bit to get a the roots (and I have long hair) and noticed it would lather much better that way. I would use this even if it did not make my hair grow more. My hair just felt better. Silkier and healthier. Great product. Wish it grew faster though"
1,The worst product I've ever tried.,"I've used this product for about 2 months, every morning and every night before going to sleep, it kept my hair the same lenght, I'm very dissapointed. My hair used to grow faster without using this product."
2,Nothing yet!,"Its ok, did not notice anything yet, but I will wait and see until I finish the whole btl."
3,Okay,"I ordered the shampoo and conditioner as a way to grow my hair one inch before prom- I'm 16 years old and my hair is around shoulder length and I highlight it every 6 months. I don't see that much of a difference in my hair after using this for almost a month-but it definitely has grown some. I'm not planning to purchase this a second time because I feel like my scalp has gotten dryer and hair a little frizzier. So I guess this product did what it was supposed to, but not by much."
1,DON'T BUY THIS,I anxiously awaited for this shampoo and conditioner. I have steadily been thinning since I've gotten little older. I couldn't really tell if this would make your hair grow or not due to the fact that the shampoo produced very little lather and the conditioner was so thin that it failed to allow me a smooth comb-out after the shower (I have color treated hair). I hated these products.
1,Don't waste your time!!,"I remember when i bought this I was obssesed with growing out my hair at the time and this product looked very promising! But while i continued to use this prodct for about 2 months my patience for it was finally over, I saw no growth whats so ever and while i would use it in the shower as i applied it to my hair it didnt feel soft as I would put any other shampoo or conditioner in my hair so i guess you can say it made my hair more dry and after I used it for a while I had an itchy scalp and it was horrible it also made my hair look dull and my hair just felt like straw maybe i would recommend this to someone with finer hair but definatley not with thick hair!!!"
2,GROW! Shampoo & Conditioner,"It didnt really do anything for my hair. I honestly wouldnt recomend this product to anybody. i starting using the vitamin Biotin (you can get it at walmart), and iv already grown and inch of hair this month! not to mention it made my nails grow too."
4,this product works,"First month my hair grew 1in total with just shampoo and conditoner. I am half way threw 2nd month I am talking the vitamins, and amoina acids still using shampoo and conditioner my hair is already grew 1 1/2in total."
4,Hair Grew!,It seems that my hair did grow a little faster than normal. I would recommend this product.
3,i havent noticed anything,"i havent noticed anything good, but it hasnt hurt my hair, either. neutral smell, doesnt seem to over clean or add too much moisture, but i bought this to help hair growth and havnet noticed anything in that direction."
2,Doesn't work,"I tried this and i had to use SO much of the shampoo for my hair to actually feel clean. I probably used 1/4 of the bottle (at least). So it will last me another 3 washes......ummmm for $20, that's not good at all. Definitely not worth the money. My hair didn't feel cleaned or conditioned. As for lengthening, i can't tell yet, but i won't be spending the money on a month's worth (which is the time they say it takes to notice any growth) to find out. Disappointing :("
2,"Don't like the shampoo, Makes my hair feel yucky","I bought these about 2 week ago to help my hair grow faster. I don't know if its helped with growth yet but I really don't like the shampoo. It makes my hair feel like straw while I'm washing it out. It does get better with the conditioner, However my hair is fuzzy and feels dry and unmanageable. I think I wasted my money and should of just stuck with just my hair vitamins and rosemary/olive oil hot oil massages which has been making my hair grow and look better."
2,GROW! Shampoo & conditioner for fast hair growth,"I recently purchased this Shampoo & conditioner because a few months ago I chopped off my hair , trying to find a new look. Well, sadly my hair hasn't grown at all and it makes my hair really dry and frizzy :| I'm not saying it wouldn't be perfect for someone else but its not something I will ever use again."
3,Grow,Didn't care for the shampoo and conditioner very much. Says it helps with breakage and split ends but it did not! Left my hair full of oil.
2,Disappointed....,This product does not work. I was very disappionted in it. my hair grew am inch from when I bought it (nov. 20). I would not recommend this product if you are in a hurry to grow ir hair fast.
3,photo miss leading,The photo made the cups look like they where slate gray on the outside and white on the insides. They where all white.
3,"Standard B-movie fare, nothing remarkable","Is it a horrible movie? I have seen much much worse than this. Does it merit 5-star ratings? You have got to be kidding me. If not for the fact that the stars went on to become President & First Lady, nobody would remember this movie any more than the countless number of B movies that were being churned out at this time.It is interesting from the standpoint of Ronald Reagan's movie career, which was rapidly drawing to a close. Movies like this are indicative of an actor whose film offers were become less & less frequent and desirable, and it explains in part why Ronald Reagan would shortly thereafter leave Hollywood behind once & for all.Do you want to kill a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon? You could do worse, for sure. But let's be real and recognize this movie for the unremarkable work that it is."
5,A treasured collection,"A wonderful movie of our beloved President Ronald Reagan, made at a time when Hollywood was patriotic to the love of our great country. My father served in the Navy during WWII and fought in the Pacific for the defeat of the Japanese Imperial Navy. This movie captures a glimpse of the heroic sacrifices made by fighting American men such as my father. This is truly a treasured collection to my library."
4,Worth A Look.,"If you are a Dodger fan, or a baseball junkie like me, you will enjoy this dvd box set. As a Dodger fan you may long for more than two games from the NLCS.Game 4 and 7 were both thrilling. However, that was an incredible series against The Mets. MLB should have put all seven games in the collection. I am not a fan of LA and I was wanting more. Overall, it is a nice set for any Dodger fan or a fan of baseball in general."
5,Very good item,"This is a great collection of games for the 1988 World Series and a great memory of all the Dodgers fan, was one of the motivate of history for the first game where Kirk Gisbson homered to Denis Eckersley in the ninth I really liked to see this series, and I hope that Major League Baseball kick for sale, 1981 world Series, where Fernando Valenzuela brightness."
1,dont buy it,you must use lexmark ink no other ink will work with this printer.i had for two years.cant not waite to get rid of it.
1,REALLY REALLY SLOW,"I am only using the kids review section so I dont have to give them my email address and get more spam...This printer works great for photos, but with the photo printer ink cartridge it only prints about 1, yes one page per minute of black and white. You cannot put it on the quickprint mode if you are using a color cartridge. I just printed 28 pages and it took 22 minutes. Horrible. Its like if you want it to do a halfway decent job of printing text then you cant use the photo cartridge, but you need that cartridge to get the 6 color photos that are so nice.NOT FOR USE AS PRIMARY PRINTER!!!"
2,Was Great for the 3 months it actually worked.,"For three months it was the best printer I ever had....then all of a sudden i couldn't move past the darn ""PAPER JAM"" error message. It also stop feeding the paper through correctly. Turned out to be a hundred dollar piece of junk! Don't waste your money."
2,Not the best value!,"I bought this printer because we have a very old Lexmark that takes a licking and keeps on ticking. Sad to say, I have never been pleased with the output. The scaner is not working properly, have not been able to get the copier to work (I still use my old HP for that) and the colored output is very bad.The photo ink is not printing as good a photo as my HP did. I finally realized that I am paying a lot for my ink and do not seem to be able to use remanufactured ink. I can buy a new printer for what I pay for the ink. Cartridges do not print as many pages as suggested when you buy the larger sized ink cartridge. I will find another printer that is ""greener"".I can say the ""fax"" worked perfectly when I needed it. So I gave it one star for that reason. I will not buy another."
4,True to size,"Well made. This item is true to size which I have trouble finding exact sizing for clothing that I have purchased. Generally the large fits like a small, the XL fits like a medium so on. This XL is actually XL which naturally is too big for me, but it is good to know for future reference I can order a medium and know it is a true medium."
5,Makes a great gift!,Open to any page & enjoy something wonderful. This book is a must have for creative people in touch with their poetic side. I own dozens of poetry books as well as art books - this is the perfect combo. A terrific coffee table book too!
3,Best of the 70's: Hits of 1972,"Although this compilation only has 10 songs on it, only three of them are the original hits you listened to on the radio. The other seven are ""sound alikes"". The reproduction is clear and well produced, but as I have stated only three are the original hits by the original musicians. They are: 1) Too Late To Turn Back Now - Cornelius Brothers; 2) Precious and Few - Climax; and Rock and Roll Lullaby - B.J. Thomas. So if those are the songs you're after for your collection then you will be gratified. Otherwise, you will be disappointed."
1,Band not flexible,The band on this watch is not very flexible at all. It is almost like a solid braclet. Not comforable at all. Very disapointed with this purchase.
4,Stylish or useful?,"apart of great look and seem durability, it is strange feature in such kind of dial. You have chronograph, but you do not have idea where it stops. 23 or 26 seconds? Difficult to find out with such a dial..."
5,Fossil Watch review,The quality of the product is great and was just as advertised. The delivery time was excellent as it was promised for a week delivery but arrived the next day! Great company to do business with.
2,Makes a great milkshake!,"The Euro-Pro Triple Ice Cream Maker sucks at making ice cream but it makes a pretty good milkshake. The batter never stiffens enough to make solid ice cream. The canisters just aren't big enough or cold enough to get a good ice cream consistency. Since I have a Kitchen Aid mixer, I hunted down the ice cream adapter for it. Just used it a minute ago and made a perfect batch of ice cream. Don't buy the Euro-Pro. It was a big disappointment."
5,Do the MArio,This is an excelent dvd i like how it sticks to the games very well i like all the video game sounds. I like the game and hidden episode. The MArio dance is so...funny.
2,Captain Lou.....CAPTAIN LOU!!!!!,"NEVER have I been so depressed over a DVD. All of the live action sequences DESTROYED! All of Captain Lou Albano's liquor induced hysteria GONE! ...for a DVD of nothing but terrible cartoons. Beautifully wretched and disgusting cartoons, but not worth their own DVD. No Captain Lou? No guy who played Luigi? No Winny Cooper as abandoned orphan girl? NO PIZZA PHONE?! And worst of all......no Do The Mario. NOOOOOOO!!!!!I'm not swinging my arms from side to side...and it stings! OH IT STINGS!... Trust this review, this DVD is not what it claims to be. 8 Colmplete episodes? Only if by complete you mean ""not complete.""So now I cry. Not in sorrow, not in pain, but for all of those who will never experience the glorious divinity that is Lou Albano stumbling durring a scripted sequence. Good night, you princes of television. You kings of entertainment.....rosebud"
1,details,"Now that I have more time....There's not only the problem of the missing commentary, but the quality of the entire DVD. It's awful. Not only are 80% of the live action parts just plain NOT THERE now, but the sound doesn't synch up on some of the episodes, inspector gadget's constant presence through the menus is just awful and useless, and the dvd's box says that it contains ""8 complete episodes, stereo, exciting game, trailers, scene access, english subtitles, and much more."" Well, it has 8 partial episodes, stereo, a lame 8 question trivia game, a sort-of trailer for their StH cartoon, subtitles, and nothing at all more.And I don't know how the other reviewers even saw it in january, it just came out this week. Shame on DIC and Trimark for releasing this in it's sorry state."
2,school success,I did not like the elementary school success disk. There were no instructions included. My 10 year old said it was too boring and easy for her.
4,Champions,Did a good job getting my item to me. Would have liked more info about where my item was at
5,A great cooking resource...,"This was one of the first dessert cookbooks I ever bought and it is still the most used (pretty much the only one now). The instructions are easy to follow and very concise. I get rave reviews on anything I make - from the Black and White Cheescake that women at a cookoff called ""Orgasmic"", to the ""Gift for Dad"" that was so rich you thought you would die. The mousse recipes never seem to work for me - but everyone loves the taste. Some recipes are difficult, but they have all tasted great. Overall, it is a great book to own and entertain with."
5,"Oh, Alice Medrich!!!!",I have all her books. One is better than the next. This is her top one. Her best one. Her creme de la creme.
3,Not sure yet,"I will buy the second book but not sure about it yet. The main character is a wise cracking sword totting teenage grim reaper(he does not appear real smart at times either, but at other times you suspect maybe it is an act.) The background this wise cracking kid is the most powerful swardsman to have ever lived or in this case died. He was in his area of hell/heaven, people like him are beyond judgement, when after only a week he had kicked the ... of all his roomies. So he was turned into a kid and made to work for the king of hell, I am guessing this was someones idea to keep him out of trouble or something??"
5,Like A Fine Wine,"Like a fine wine, ""How You See Anything"" is to be savored ever so slowly. Each story speaks to our values, thoughts, and feelings which reflect evry day living. You need to allow adequate time to assimilate what each lesson is trying to tell us. The authors through their stories remind us we have choices in life, we need to respect ourselves and others, and always allow for the unexpected..........truly how we interpret our world is how we will react to it. Certainly this book of treasures is a wise choice for gift giving to those you find special in your life. I look forward to learning more from reading Volume Two of How You See Anything in the future."
5,JW PET Company Whirlwheel,"My dog absolutely loves this toy. It is the ONLY toy she consistently wants to play with. It is very durable and a great value. I was so happy to find it on Amazon as we were dogsitting for a friend who brought this toy to our house and my dog was just obsessed with it. After I ordered it on Amazon, I was afraid she would have no interest since it didn't belong to the other dog but she was very excited to play with it and still is everyday. In fact she often takes it on walks with us."
2,"Excellent Product - Not, Updated","Excellent product. Flies very nicely and is convenient. I have a small dog and the small size is just right for my 10 lb. Havanese. Easy to pick-up for the dog. Not for big dogs or extreme chewers. As with all dog toys, supervise its use.Update 11-11-12: This is durable for my small dog, and has a nice squeeker, but it drops fast, is heavy, and does not fly far. I recommend the soft edged fabric type as it is light, kind to the mouth, easy to pick-up for the dog, durable, and flies far; folds into your pocket, too. I, and my Havanese, do not recommend this JW Whirlwheel."
2,jw pet company whirlwheel flying disk,I was under the impression that this toy would hold up to chewing and aggressive play. The toy was in bite size chunks after 0ne play session. If your dog has teeth I would not recommend this toy.
2,Not chew resistant,"I bought this for our vigorous chewer because of the reviews that said it would last long. Not so. By the end of the first day, my dog had chewed through the toy and removed the squeaker. He still loves the toy, but it's not what I bought."
2,My Dog Could Care Less,I bought this whirlwheel along with two other Frisbees. This one is the one she has no interest in. Absolutely none. I can't say I like it much either. It does not fly well which is the way it's designed. It may keep some dogs occupied but mine has no interest in it.
3,It's Okay,"This is an okay product. Personally, my dog has not shown much interest in it. I suspect she could easily chew it to pieces if she spent any amount of time on it, but as it stands, this is just one of those toys she doesn't really care for. It came coated in a strange white powder and I had to scrub it off before giving it to my dog."
4,"Awareness of dying, awareness of good research","First, let me state that I only decided to purchase this book because of its place as an exemplar of qualitative research. I did not buy the book because I have an interest in medical affairs. I only mention this because I had no way to judge that aspect of the book. Anyway, this book is a useful example of how to write up qualitative social science. It's strength rests in the fact that the authors are able to create with much success the details associated with the experience, as well as the meaning of these events for those involved. This is an important step in making one's research relevant for those reading it, and this book's authors get it. All in all, one of the more enjoyable examples of this type of research."
2,Two things that shouldn't go together,"An interesting mix of rock instrumentation to traditional middle eastern vocals. Unfortunately, the two styles don't mix well when both are left in their unaltered style. Some very nice music here, broken by the swooping and shaking vocals. Just goes to show that some things just don't sound good to a techno beat."
1,Seven,"Although this book is depicted as being art, I fear it is not. The poses of the girls are explicitly sexual, not erotic. What is even more alarming are the phrases being shown beneath each picture. Phrases such as: ""Ne tochez pas"" and ""Not until or unless I say so!"" express the desire to have sex with a little girl.There is nothing wrong in being shown naked. The problem comes when others say or influence the way you will pose, and even worse, they will decide what ""you think"", like it is being shown in the phrases underneath each picture in this book.The photographies are excellent but the way Hamilton displays ""erotism"" is in doubt."
4,Nude Photography by Hamilton,"This book takes a sensual look at beautiful young people and nature. Although it is not Hamilton's best (see 25 Years of an Artist for a great sampling of his previous work), it is definately a great buy. I'd also recommend family naturist books for those interested in the beauty of youth and nature 'Holy Nature: A Celebration of Naturism in Todays Russia' is one such book sold through Amazon (excellent choice for Hamilton fans)."
2,A cynical manipulation with pretensions to high art.,"Hamilton's work is erotic and titillating, which I am very much in favor of, but it seems he's uncomfortable appealing directly to our lust. He borrows heavily from classic art and literature in hopes of elevating his photography in the public's eye, and elevating his reputation to that of artist (or ""artiste""). He makes maximum use of soft focus, sepia tones and other tricks to give the work the appearance of art, but the deception is paper-thin; ultimately the pictures strike me as saccharine and precious. They are accompanied by high-sounding quotations culled from various literary works, the sort of thing that leaves students in Freshman English gasping with awe. His models are naked and they could be delightful; unfortunately he dresses them up as nudes."
4,As complex as its subjects,"This is possibly the most beautiful set of photo portraits I've ever seen. Like the subjects, though, the beauty has a scary side to it.There's a lot more to say. The pictures are intense, and more intense as a collection. I'm sure everyone who sees it will have more to say, and everyone will say something different. For that matter, I could discuss this in three or four contradictory ways. This time, I prefer to let the pictures speak for themselves and to let the readers form opinions of their own."
5,Brilliantly erotic photography of pubescent girls,"If your a fan of David Hamilton's work this is an absolutemust, every photograph has it's own unique beauty.This book really shows that there is no more beautiful imagein the world than that of the female body especially in it'sage of innocence."
4,Beautifuly but Hazy,"Hamilton's famous 'haze look' is clearly evident, many of his subjects poses are one dimensional. I experienced many mixed emotions upon viewing this work. On one hand, Hamilton definitely is a very talented photographer. Other photographers have borrowed his ideas and techniques. However, the book is really more about his artistic technique with a camera than about the beauty of his subjects. I purchased this along with another book on Amazon, ""Holy Nature: A Celebration of Naturism"". Both books are created by photographers who seek to capture the beauty of the nude and nature. However, in the Holy Nature book, you can the photography is clear and the prints large and in color. You are seeing the beauty of the female nudes and their surroundings. In this book the beauty is often obscured by a blurry or hazy black and white image."
4,very good!,"David Hamilton touches on the heart of innonence with this book. Their will always be people who think that nudity in any form is bad. I feel if you have an open mind for art and the beauty of a nude{no matter what the age}, you will love this book."
2,Too much photo cropping,"The reputation of Hamilton suggested that this would be a valuable book on the subjects of his photography. While the quality of the paper and the printing was excellent, the photos fell short of what I had expected.There was far too much cropping of the photos, leaving out too much of the photo image. That was very disappointing. The artistic presentation and the verses for each photo were excellent.Next time, show the complete subject of the photo - - - don't cut off so much."
4,Some comments on the DVD...,"First, in response to a previous review, there does not seem to be anything cut from the movie. It's 90 minutes long, and that agrees with how long it should be according to IMDB (Internet Movie DataBase). I don't recall any scenes that weren't on the DVD. On the other hand, I could have sworn that the line, ""If you like it so much, why don't you MARRY it!"" was from the movie, so either I missed it, or I'm guessing that I'm mistaken and that it's from _Pee Wee's Playhouse_ or elsewhere.Secondly, as someone else noted, there are 4 ""deleted"" scenes included on the DVD that aren't mentioned in the description or on the box. However, they aren't very strong scenes, so it's easy to see why they were deleted.All in all, it was the movie that I remembered and loved. As a 37-year-old, I appreciated more the absurdist art behind the film. My 4-year-old said that it was the best movie ever (though I skipped the part with Large Marge and two small bits of violence)."
1,Extremely Low Quality Copy,"Almost unwatchable. Ghosts, shadows, and something odd with the contrast. Like looking at a really old TV. Extremely Low Quality Copy."
4,The greatest of the weirdest,4 *'s because this is a true gem of a movie. The DVD is about as basic as it comes w/ few special features.
5,awesomeness,"Ecxellent.. I had no problems with the DVD and it arrived sooner than I thought. I also like the movie, it's funny. A good kids movie"
5,"Great Stuff, you ignoramuses!","To the people who no NOTHING about this movie:You obviously didn't know that this was Burton's FIRST film-give him a LITTLE credit, will you?And also Danny Elfman's first theatrical score ( not including the Forbidden Zone theme ). The breakfast machine is awesome. The movie was well done, especially the heard task of a much down-graded character like Pee-Wee Herman. Paul ( Reubens ), you did an EXCELLENT job!!!The plot is meant to be funny, and the film meant to be enjoyed by all. What did you expect out of this film?? Well, it met MY expectations.The DVD is awesome. Special Features include:* audio-commentary by Paul Reubens and Tim Burton* music-only track with commentary by Danny Elfman* theatrical trailerGood job all!"
5,Best DVD Experience Yet!,"Words cannot describe how I felt when I first turned on this DVD. The movie by itself already is a classic. This DVD is probally the best thing since sliced bread! Amazon.com also forgot to mention the awesome deleted scenes, especially the one with Amazing Larry (and his flying toupee)! If you're a Pee-wee fan, the meaning of life is in this DVD. One big but(hehe!)though is that this edition is widescreen, so you don't get to see the goofs like the chain coming up through the bike case. Despite that minor fact, this is still the best DVD ever. So run out and pick it up now!"
4,Another Tim Burton Classic!!!,"This is a really good classic of the 80's! Since it's a Tim Burton film, you get a depressing tone, Danny Elfman music, and black & white stripes. I love the way Pee-Wee's house looks. Pee-Wee's pimped out bike is stolen, and he goes around America looking for it. From Texas to Hollywood he looks for it, and he finally finds, but he has to outrun the security guards of Hollywood. If you loce the 80's and comedies, you'll love PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE!!!"
3,This is cool!,"This is SO cool! I was looking for those ""Omen"" movies, and guess what pops up? Yup, ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure!"" I mean, I KNOW that Pee Wee...ahem...movies have been...naughty, but is he really the antichrist?"
2,Great Great Comedy..........But Wait a Minute.,Does anyone i mean anyone notice all the major sceens that are cut in this movie. DONT BUY THIS DVD ITS CUT CUT CUT. 92 MINUTES COMON WHERES THE OTHER 15.
1,His Face Looked Like This....,"I know that this sounds pretty silly, but this movie scared me more than anything. I don't remember much of the movie, except for one scene.....LARGE MARGE. I must have been at least 3 or 4 when I saw it, but that was still terrifying. This is not a child's movie, but if you want your kid to see it, I'd skip the Large Marge scene. Come on people, her face EXPLODES. It's not for kids! Bravo to Tim Burton though, being scared of this movie has actually been one of my favorite experiences."
1,Dumbest Movie Ever!,"Pee-Wee Herman is the biggest scumbag to ever hit the big screen. Tedious work made by Tim Burton, the same guy who made ""Batman"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"". I was disappointed to find out that he had made such a stupid movie. Who in the world would go search for a horrible-looking bike like that? Awful."
3,Good movie!,I've seen this movie in the theaters along time ago when I was four. Now that I am twenty years old I don't like this movie that much as I use to. I guess when your a little kid you like this kind of movie but when you get older you start to hate it. My parents do not like Pee-wee Herman but I do. I think he's a good comic actor that made little kids laugh and brought them joy. I use to watch this movie all the time when I was a kid. I think it's still a good movie even though if I am tired of it. I mean heck Phil Hartman wrote the script right and Tim Burton directed it. The director who did Batman and The Nightmare Before Christmas. Those were good movies too. So if you are a parent and have kids I think you should let your kids watch this movie because they would like it. It's a great family film to watch. Rent it or buy it!
2,Not the same Pee-wee who was on children's TV,"I discovered Pee-wee Herman through Pee-wee's Playhouse on TV in the late 80s when my son was little. We all loved him. He was as sweet and gentle as Mr Rogers but with an edge of extremely creative insanity that was a lot of fun. He is not the same in this movie. He is bad-tempered, selfish and creepy. Expecting to find the same character who was on TV, I was very seriously disappointed. This movie was made several years before the Playhouse, and I read (after watching this movie) that Paul Reubens intentionally modified the character for children when he started the Playhouse; I like that character much better.I can see why this movie would please a lot of adults, but not any children I would want to know. If anyone else buys it expecting to see the Playhouse Pee-wee they may be as disappointed and turned off by this movie as I was. I read that Reubens wants to make a movie of the Playhouse, which will make me happy if it resurrects the right Pee-wee."
5,pea wey,"pea wey iz a grate moovy, it iz goood, and i lik it. it iz mie favrit moovy evr maed in the wrold. in facct i luv it becuz it iz adventiris, becuz thee guy swingz froom a rop abov a lak and goz on his bicicl. fun and exitng."
5,Let's make an international Pee Wee Herman day!!!!!!,This is the best movie I have ever seen. Paul Reubens is absolutley phenominalllll! I hope everybody aggrees with me that we should have a national pee wee herman day!!!!!
1,Cut Cut Cut,"This is also a chopped up version just look at the running time it is 90 minutes, the original film was much longer,i have the previous relese dvd and it is 90 minutes and it has many many parts cut out even my nephew noticed all the parts that were missing, till they relese a fully restored version dont buy it."
5,Classic!,"Who doesn't love Pee Wee? Used to watch the Playhouse on Saturdays so when this came out, I couldn't wait see it with my friends. Watching it now, years later, brought back all those memories. And I got to share it with my nephews and niece...they love it too! Now they walk around saying all the funny lines...""I'm tryyyyying to use the phoooone! Ha-ha!"""
4,classic comedy madness,"I never saw the original Pee Wee Herman show during the 80's, but still enjoyed this film. It starts out funny, but isn't really hilarious all the way through like some comedy films are. Some of the one-liners are pretty good, and I like most of the characters. (the woman who does the voice of Tommy Pickles plays as Pee-Wee's love interest) That being said, it's a $5 DVD, so I bought it as an impulse buy. Definitely worth the small price, even if you don't watch it often."
5,A one-of-a-kind classic comedy,"It is really such a shame about what happened to actor Paul Reubens and his alter-ego Pee-wee Herman. This is an absolutely delightful, one-of-a-kind classic comedy. The follow-up film, Big Top Pee Wee, while it has it's moments, can't possibly even begin to compare. As one film critic said of this film at the time it was released, just leave your sanity at the door and enjoy it!!"
5,An American Classic,"This is the funniest movie I have ever seen, and now that it's available on DVD makes owning it even better. It's great to be able to jump instantly to your favorite scene, and the narration with Paul Reubens and Tim Burton is a really nice extra.Paul (aka Pee-Wee Herman} can make me laugh harder doing something as simple as brushing his teeth with a giant toothbrush than all of today's comedians and their crude language put together. The man has so much talent, it's a shame he was exiled from tv for something so harmless. I hope he brings Pee-Wee back to television or the movies soon.Now if MGM/United Artists will just bring the Playhouse episodes out on DVD, Happy will be my Secret Word."
5,You wouldnt be here if you werent interested!,"A great movie. Tim Burton, fresh off the disney lot hooks well into this movie, getting the chance to do multiple Genre's in one film. A great piece of limited budget and special effect, proving a good script and good actors can save you ever time. The DVD is fair, with some specials on it and extra footage. The commentary by Burton and Ruebins is alright, although they sit and laugh a bit too much. Still, interesting insight into some of the little things in the movie. I Would recommend this movie to anyone interested in film, or comedy!"
5,The funniest movie...,"Pee Wee loves his bicycle, like it's his own child. Francis, loves it too, and will do anything to get it. He gets his way, and as a result Pee Wee begins a frantic search for his precious bike. His agony over the loss leads him to a fortune-teller named Madame Ruby, who tells him (by way of store signs) that his bicycle can be found at the Alamo, ""in the basement."" He believes it and hitches rides with an escaped convict named Mickey, a ghost truck driver who goes by the name Large Marge (her scene is hilarious) and a sardine-eating hobo in a train car. He gets so annoyed by the hobo's off-key rendition of ""Jimmy Crack Corn"", that he jumps off the train, and lands in San Antonio. The adventure continues from there, with lots of funny characters and memorable moments."
4,Pee Wee Rocks!,"Again, this could be a five-star movie, depending on your point of view. The whole movie is a comic masterpiece, using every kind of humor it can, from slapstick to social to just plain looney. Tim Burton's first film really captures his vision of surrealness. Paul Reubens gives a touching performance as Pee Wee. Aside from a couple scary moments, this is great for the wee kids and massive adults, too (and teenagers going through insecure rebelious feelings, like me). The only people who won't like this are those who need to lighten up. It's magical."
4,SILLY,I LOVE PEE WEE. I HAVE TO ADD THIS TO MY COLLECTION BECAUSE IT TAKES ME BACK AND GIVES ME WARM FEELINGS...HOPE ITS NOT PEE WEE
4,Good product,"I love this movie, so I wanted to make sure that the copy was just as good. To my surprise, the movie quality was excellent. Definately work the money spent."
5,ARARARARAGG!! tell Large Marge sent ya! Heheheheheh!,"What else to say...Get it. Watch it alone and laugh, watch it with your kids and repeat lines forever. Watch it as a drinking game and be hammered by the end of ""I don't make monkeys, I just train them!""."
4,A silly good time....,"This is one of my all time favorite movies! Not only is it the original PeeWee movie but also a very early Tim Burton movie. If you are a PeeWee fan, this is a MUST see...one of my favorite scenes is the pet shop rescue....I have had a copy of this on VHS and DVD for a few years. I am passing the ""PeeWee bug"" to my two nephews for Christmas this year..."
5,Long Live Pee Wee,"You know how when you're young you laugh and laugh and laugh at the silliest things and your laughter makes others start to laugh also and then more people start to laugh and everyone forgot what was so funny to begin with? I remember what we were laughing at...Pee Wee Herman!This movie is classic from top to bottom,from that big goofy bike (complete with handle bar streamers) right down to the dumbest dance I have ever seen performed to, ""Tequila"" and I have done my fair share of time in establishments that serve Tequila ;)Pee Wee is always entertaining and the adult humor goes right over the kiddies heads so they can enjoy it too...Long live Pee Wee!"
5,A Classic,"I've loved this movie since I was a child. It's still just as funny as it was the first time I saw it.It's about a man who never grew up and still acts like a child who has lost his precious bike and sets out on a long journey to get it back,meeting many people on the road.I don't see how anyone could dislike this movie. Some people say that it's about nothing but sex! There is hardly anything to do with sex in this movie.Also, I thought I should correct one reviewer who says that this movie is not appropriate for children because Larg Marge's head ""explodes"". Her head DOES NOT explode! She turns into a monster for less than 2 seconds. I repeat, her head DOES NOT explode!"
4,A movie both kids and adults will love,"I loved this movie growing up, and now that I'm an adult I think I love it even more since I appreciate a lot more of the jokes. This is a Tim Burton film, which lots of people don't realize, and it has a lot of dark-but-hilarious parts. Really, a very high-quality, cleverly written movie. Don't let Pee Wee's later . . . ""misadventure"" . . . turn you off from this great movie."
4,Pee-Wee's Best!,"Well, it's up against another Pee-Wee movie. Big Top Pee-Wee that is. This one is so much fun because it seems that it came from a child's imagination. It's a big kid's world. Like the whole world is Fun World. And it's funny! The humor is amazing! The show never takes itself seriously at all, and Burton had scored another hit!"
5,Plain Hilarious,"I am 14 years old and I used to watch Pee-wee's Playhouse on Sat. mornings since 1987. I think that if you like Pee-wee's Playhouse, you'll like Pee-wee's Big Adventure."
5,Greatest Movie of All-time!,"This is my ALL-TIME favorite movie. I'm not really a Pee-wee Herman fan, but this movie kept me laughing the WHOLE time! The hilarious gags and clever ideas were excellent. This is Pee-wee's masterpiece. I don't remember a movie that matches the creativity and imagination of this. I'd also like to add that this was Morgan Fairchild's best movie as well, even though she only appears for like 2 minutes in an uproarous James Bond parody at the end. YOU MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
5,Think this movie is going to suck? Think Again!,"I rememeber the day I first saw this on Encore, i had caught in the middle thinking it would be a bad movie, but boy was I wrong, it's funny, smart, and fun to watch again and again, I love the first about 25 minutes the most, Pee Wee at the magic shop and his fight with Francious are hilarious. I think Tim Burton has be a genius for his direction in this film he moves the camera as if he is telling you what is going on scene after scene. Also, listen to Danny Elfman's score as you watch, I love his 'Psychoisque' song whenever Pee wee's bike is stolen. Paul Ruebens also did a great job in this movie, despite what all that has happened to him, see this flm will make you wonder - why don't they making another one of these movies?"
4,They don't make funny like this anymore,"This movie is even more funnier than I remembered. Paul Reuben really nails this role and when you check the credits behind this film in terms of Phil Hartman as a writer and Tim Burton directing, it is no surprise why there are big laughs in almost every scene"
5,Awesome movie!,"My childhood favourite on DVD! Didn't even know its directed by Tim Burton, not surprised as I love all of his movies!"
5,As good as I remember,"Watched it with my kids, and they loved that I can still recite this movie line for line. I love the whole ""Alamo"" part with SNL alum Jan Hooks. My kids favorite scene? ""Large Marge"" of course!"
5,clasic movie,"this classic still holds up today and brings back good memories, i would recomend if you like 80s style movies ."
4,"Knitting, and knitting, and knitting...","Visually, verbally and otherwise, this movie is delightful. Ahead of its time for 1985, tastes have caught up but Pee Wee hasn't lost any steam; a minor, underrated classic."
5,Funny Movie!!,"I *LOVE* this movie. I love the part with Large Marge. She is so cool. Paul Reubens is brilliant as nerdy Pee-Wee Herman. This movie is one of my all time favorites. I have the movie on VHS and the soundtrack on CD. But I am wanting to get the movie on DVD it is that good. If you haven't seen ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" I suggest giving it a try, because you won't be disapointed. I also suggest trying ""Big Top Pee-Wee"" and ""Pee-Wee's Playhouse."" I have loved ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" for over ten years.Music composer Danny Elfman composed the perfect music. The circus like music is perfect for this movie. Danny Elfman is one of my favorite composers. He always composes great music. Danny Elfman has also composed music for the 1989 ""Batman"" movie, ""Batman Returns"" and ""Beetlejuice.""Tim Burton did a fantastic job at directing this laugh out loud comedy. Tim Burton also directed the 1989 ""Batman"" movie, ""Batman Returns"" and ""Beetlejuice."""
3,Pee-wee Herman is still just as dorky- and funny- as I remember.,"I watched this movie way back in my early 20s, and bought it so my teenager could see who Pee-wee Herman was. She thought it was hilarious!"
2,"Strange Flavor, Bitter Residue","This soup had a strange, gritty texture in my mouth, like when you get a mouthful of sea water, and it left an unappetizing residue at the bottom of the bowl. It also came out darker than most mulligatawny I've had in the past, with a bitter ingredient I didn't recognize, a flavor that lingered in my mouth, and not in a good way. I can't say I hated this soup, it was palatable, but I won't go out and pick up another pack any time soon."
5,Great Show...Too bad my copy was defective....,"The Jefferson's 2nd Season is one of the show's best. Now you can see this super season in all it's glory!Unfortuately I had to return my first copy becuase for some reason the 1st disc wouldn't play on my 2 DVD players! At least I saw the last 2 discs. I did finally replace it with no problems.Anyways, I love this show and like I stated above, think it's one of the series' best seasons. My favorite episode of course is ""George Meets Whittendale"" which is the classic episode where George gets locked in the bathroom with the Willises.Funny stuff. A lot of the scenes during this season are featured in the following season's opening title sequence (ex. George dancing on his bed, Louise acting like an indian in front of Lionel and Jenny in the kitchen, the Willises and George locked in the bathroom, etc.)Make sure you get this if you are a fan of The Jeffersons. If you like the first season set, you'll love this, and vice versa."
3,"5 stars for series, 1 for lack of subtitles",the jeffersons must be one of the greatest tv shows of all time and this dvd is great. unfortunately I'm really disappointed by the complete lack of subtitles (the first series had them).so I'll give 5 stars for the series (and the dvd the reunites the complete second season) but just 1 star because of the missing subtitles.
2,design flaw on closure,"I bought this to replace a Polar that just didn't fit well, and was happy to have the great fit of this one. The clasp closure broke after only 4 uses, and it is NOT a replaceable part, so I had to return it and give up on this item"
5,They Can't Get Enough,"When I purchased this CD, I thought my kids (ages 5 & 7) might enjoy the story once or twice. I haven't had much luck in the past with products that were supposed to be ""educational"", and I thought they would see right through my attempt to sneak in a lesson about virtues. Boy, was I wrong... they can't get enough of this great story. I hear them singing the songs, even when the CD isn't playing. Steve Green is an excellent storyteller. I hope your young children will love this as much as mine."
5,Great stories and great fun,"Got this for my 4 year old to listen to in the car. It has evolved into his nighttime story and he chooses it even over me reading to him on many nights. Great fun voices and songs and the stories all have a nice point. It has even initiated disussions I had not expected like, why is little dog lazy?Can't wait to share with my nieces and nephews."
5,Worth it's price,"We've had this set for over a year now and our little girl (now almost 5) still loves it. She loves building and uses all the shapes and can still make-up new constructions. We've also had fun combining with her marble run and Thomas the Train set to make additional tunnels, bridges and buildings - sometimes placing little flameless tea lights inside some of the buildings to make them shine. She's put her little plastic animals in the buildings she's made at times. It's just one of her most used, fun toys!"
5,awesome toy!!,my 3 year old daughter loves it. she has them in school and most her friends have it. try to wait for the price to go down bec. 200 is a lot. 100 pieces is def. not a lot but its a great starter amount. if it goes cheaper eventually i would love to buy another 100 piece
5,My kids love these things,"My kids are 6 and 3 and they are always playing with their magna-tiles. Yeah, I was a little hesitant to lay out $126 when I bought them, but they've held up exceptionally well and my kids have gotten a LOT of play time out of them. If you do your calculations as hours of fun per dollar spent, then this toy is a wise investment. The 100-piece set has a lot of different ways to build things because of all the pieces, but I'm considering adding on another set. Still, I haven't done that yet, which I think is a testament to 100 pieces maybe being just about right."
5,Magna-Tiles Translucent Are The Best!,"I bought these for my Grandson two years ago.....Now at the grand ole age of 3-1/2, I'm buying another set. He has two sisters (ages 10 & 8). They all absolutely LOVE these - hence, the reason for another set. These are a bit ""pricey"", but worth every penny when you consider the quality and how much they are played with (even Mom & Dad get creative!)."
5,Can't have enough of these,"We have 1 large set and 1 small set shared by 3 boys ages 4 to 6. We have had them over 2 years, and they are by far the favorite, for my boys and their friends that come over. They started out making buildings, and now create spacecraft. boats, launches, docks, etc. They make boxes and ""wrap"" toys in them for gifts for momma. I really see these as the modern day wooden block, with magnets and great colors. And unlike legos, there is building without millions of tiny pieces that can get lost. And you really can't have enough. I think we will add to the collection this Christmas and get another large set. $150 is expensive, but if you think of all the junk out there with little pieces that break of get lost, and the creative value it gives children, it somehow seems worth it. My boys play and imagine for hours. Can't put a price on that."
4,Brilliant,With loads of other new toys opened at christmas this toy was the one that was played the most and by all ages - from 3 years to 9 year olds.
5,The toy that gets played with the most,"These are my almost 3 year old's (and my) favorite Christmas purchase. They get used almost every day and for at least 30 minutes. I think what makes them fun is that they can be ""snapped"" into endless combinations making for a toy that little ones (and me) never get tired of. They're also beautiful (like stained glass) to look at. I was on the fence about which set to get and this larger 100 piece set was really the way to go. And while 100 is a lot of pieces, you see how quickly they get used when building something. I can't imagine having any less. Spring for this set, you and your little ones won't be disappointed."
5,100 piece set does have large squares!! great item,"someone gave this a negative review that the 100 piece set didn't have the large square it does, we now have the 36 piece and the 100 piece and we love it!!"
5,"Great toy, well worth the price","My 2 boys (1 & 3 year olds) have enough toys to stock several departments at Toys R Us, yet this is the toy that (by far) gets used the most.My older son enjoys building, and the younger one enjoys destroying; so, as long as we manage to keep the younger boy occupied long enough to allow the older one to complete his construction project, and then help the older brother channel his anger into re-building vs. hitting the young wrecking ball, we can have them occupied and delighted for long stretches of time. Therefore, despite the high price, I feel that this purchase has been a great value and recommend it to all of our friends with kids."
5,magna tiles,"Unbelievable! I have a daycare and it is the toy every kid from age 1 to 15 want to play with. I will be ordering more sets of the magna tiles. Even though they are on the upside, price wise, they are well worth it."
5,Imagination Galore!!!,"I have a 4 year old son who is autistic. He has always played with Legos and Fisher Price Trio. I needed to find a new toy to be used as a reinforcer for therapy and to keep him busy during down time. This set was the perfect solution! My son creates patterns and builds towers. Clean up is so easy. The tiles' magnets snap together into piles in seconds, and you are out the door. It is almost impossible to lose them!I understand that the price is on the high end (@ $1.20 per tile), but, I just ordered my 2nd set of 100. They are soooo worth it!"
5,A must-buy,"I am a preschool teacher. This is the best toy I've ever seen. Day after day, 3-5 year olds, girls and boys, enjoy this toy."
3,Five Star Toy at A Rip Off Price,"I love these tiles and ordered a set of 100 last year. The kids love them so much (2 to 12 yrs) that I decided to get a second set. Just paid $110 delivered from Module R. This company wants almost twice that much for the same tiles.Normally I don't downgrade an item for the cost but if I had given the product five stars, the alert would have been lost.Check the manufacturer's website for other alternatives to purchase."
1,Dont pay over $100 or you're getting ripped off!,"Just a fair warning. The scalpers have jacked the price up from the regular, year round $100, to close to $300....it is nnnnnnnnnnnnotworth that....dont believe that all the people who have left good reviews have paid this price. Other than that....$100 is still on the pricey side, but you've got to figure it might be worth that price to figure what all the hype is about. (hype as in good reviews, not like its advertised on tv or anything)"
5,Buying our Third Hundred Piece Set,"We bought a set of 100 when our son was 4 and they were an instant hit. At his request, we bought another set when he was 6 so that he could build bigger and more elaborate structures. He has requested a third set as a 9th birthday gift. He has used them to build everything from generic skyscrapers to Clone Wars bases to Angry Birds setups. I love that they are incorporated into a wide range of play. They are one of the best toy purchases we have ever made and I am happy to spend money on something that he plays with regularly and helps him be so creative. I cannot recommend these highly enough!"
4,Magna tiles,I purchased the Magna tiles for our 3 yr. old granddaughter. She loves them and plays with them in many different creative ways. Her 7 year old sister seems likewise captivated by the many ways she can build with the tiles.
3,Great toy but beware paying 200 is almost twice normal price,I'm getting this for my son for Christmas but shocked at how high the price is considering the normal price for the 100 set is around ~$120! I got mine from a third party vendor Lakeshore Learning which sold these for $120 and google to get an online coupon for a further discount.
5,Love them!,"My daughter LOVES these! Actually, all my kids (10, 8 and 4) love these. My 4 and 8 yr olds could spend hours creating and playing with them. It is fun to see what they come up with. It usually has something to do with a home for a little animal or a spaceship of some sort. I bought them because they are so popular at my daughter's preschool and she kept talking about how she played with them at school. Highly recommend."
5,Amazing toy,"I bought this toy for my 5 year old boy. Ever since he got this he has not asked me to turn on the TV. This toy is very educational and a lot of fun. He is learning a lot about geometry. He now knows the difference between an equilateral, isosceles and right triangles. I just wish I had purchased it sooner."
5,Magna -Tiles Translucent 100 pieces,Child & parents are enjoying playing / working with the Magna - Tiles. I thought they were expencive tho. The translucent are very pretty too.
5,Hours of fun,My 4 1/2 year old son had these at his preschool and loved them. We got the 100 piece set for Christmas and he is a budding architect. Even the 6 1/2 year old loves building structure and they play together. We bought a light box for them to build on so they can see the colors and it looks fantastic.
3,Great for an only child,Super fun toy. Super easy for a young kid to create beautiful geometric structures. Super easy for a sibling to grab one tile from the bottom and send the whole thing crashing down to a chorus of screams and retributions.
2,Do not purchase online,"Do not purchase this guitar online. Especially not from the company Music123. On it's second use the input jack fell apart and is now inside the guitar. When I informed the company of the issue they referred me to the manufacturer warranty. Since I purchased this online, if I want to have something simple like this fixed I would need to mail it back. For what you pay for this guitar, you expect more than a few hours of play time. I will never purchase a guitar online again."
1,Don't buy this,This is the second Kanguru card reader I bought - and they both were a waste of my money. Don't bother with this - buy an Atech Flash card reader instead -
1,I Must Tell the Scroogey Truth,"Yeah, everybody else is so gung-ho about this book that I feel like a real puppy-kicker to have to say that I really didn't like it - but I really didn't like it. There's no real tension or suspense - or even point - to the title question -- since the child is addressing God (or Jesus) by name at pretty much every point where the question is raised. And prayer is what? I mean - DUH! Who wouldn't get it? And who would want to be dragged through an entire day's worth of repeated examples, hammering the point home? Not I, buckaroo."
1,Doesn't really work right,"I was trying to get this product on eBay for $35, but didn't win the bid, so I went to Amazon and paid about twice as much for it. The first thing I noticed was the circuit card in the control module seemed to be in the wrong case, as it didn't really fit right, and the case had big holes where it didn't need them. The kit works fine, and the range on the touchpad is great - you can put it very far from the module and it would still work. Installation is also pretty simple. Mine does have one problem though - when you enter the code to unlock the car, it does nothing, and when you start entering the code again, like push 2 buttons, then it unlocks. It's also supposed to lock the doors when you push the last two buttons at the same time, any time. This only works within a couple seconds of entering the unlock code. Perhaps mine is defective. I think there are better units out there than this one."
3,2 Writers Equal A Good Mystery,"In the beginning of this book I found the changing of viewpoints every other chapter disruptive of the flow of the story, but this improved as the book went on. Overall, this is a good book and I would recommend it.I prefer the Sharon McCone books written only by Marcia Muller, but this book is definitely important to the history of Sharon McCone and is worth reading."
4,another good film by Brett Piper,"Brett Piper is probably seduction cinema's best film directors around. Bacterium is kinda a rip off of The Blob, but different. I have been a fan of Piper since I saw SHOCK-O-RAMA, another one of his films as well as Screaming Dead and Bite Me! All in all see films by Brett Piper and be surprised."
3,good,"Good item, but i rather have the original CD album rather than download from the comp. a little pricey too but worth the double disk chopped too"
3,Not the same...,"I don't think this is one of SPM's top albums. Unlike 3rd Wish and Power Moves, it seems like they get weaker and weaker... I even like Never Change and Time is Money, and I consider myself a big fan. This is simply not a very good album... 2 or 3 songs are really good, but the rest is so-so..."
2,Nothing new---except spin,"Lots of chest-beating, ""Germans"" won Waterloo stuff (Germans? These small nationalities did not consider themselves Germans...I know; one was my ancestor). So what value does this have? Minimal, in my opinion; just another book on Waterloo passed off as groundbreaking.Want to own a really good book on Waterloo? Get ""The Waterloo Companion"" by Mark Adkin...it is a superb book that blows away this hyperbole."
3,'Old Boney',"I think it was the actor Christopher Plummer playing the Duke of Wellington who, at the height of the Battle of Waterloo film says: ""If Blucher and his Germans don't arrive soon, I've a good mind to march down this hill and whip old Boney myself."" That's been the general view of the battle by English historians for almost 200 years now. This book dispels that notion. There are more German allies than British in Wellington's army and its Blucher's Prussian army that carries the day.Lots of details like various march orders tend to slow the book down to a crawl, especially after the battle when the day by day doings of every brigade just becomes tedious to read."
1,"""more a german victory...."" ?????","In short, this book came from total bias. Whilst the author claims that he has accurate records etc., it doesn't take long for the reader to see that the author is determined to make Wellington look bad. In between those ""accurate records"", his (the author's) own negative opinions, and strong opposition to Wellington, is evident. No matter what Wellington did, he was wrong...The author forgets that it was an allied victory, the Prussians were late and, that the French were too strong for them (Ligny)! Whilst the Prussians joined in the battle (even though late), they certainly were NOT the reason for the victory won.If you want history, don't waste your time or money on any of this author's writings... We wish we hadn't wasted our money!"
5,Much needed book!!,I think a homeschooling book from an LDS perspective is much overdue. I was very impressed with the work put into this book. Love the Quotes and resource information. Good Job!!
5,Missing and Murdered Children,"I think this book was very informative. I was doing a research paper and if I didn't have to have four periodicals I would have only used this book. I thought it was great, it was sad but it was good for my paper. I would recommend it for anyone related to this topic or that needs information on this topic."
5,Amazing Zucchero,"Excelent, a very good production an perfomance of Zucchero, the audio is amazing,the songs are beautifull .Special ambience and athmosfere of the Royal Albert Hall, you fell that you are there.H.Fernando"
5,"Solid, reliable and well designed","I have used this in my tent for a number of family camping trips and it works exactly as advertised. It is much more rugged than Mr. Heaters, although I built a platform with chicken wire to keep a safe space around it so sleeping backs and other tent hazards don't ignite. Use this or Mr. Heaters with extreme caution in a tent!"
1,BEWARE! Company out of business?,"BEWARE! to any purchaser of a Paulin Propane Product, There is no after purchase support for warranty or replacement parts. Their website is shut down and their phones are disconnected. Can't recommend a purchase of this or other Paulin Propane Products."
3,"For the true Broadway fan (or Bacharach fan, or Orbach fan)","Buyer beware! This cast album is not up to the caliber of greatness the talent involved would suggest. Half of the songs are good, but the other half are summed up by the song ""Turkey Lurkey Time."" Jerry Orbach's singing is very strong making ""Promises, Promises"" and ""Wanting Things"" exceptional. Unfortunately Miss O'Hara shrieks through her songs (which should have been some of the best songs) as if she were still in the cast of ""Hair."" Even with all the force she exudes it seems she is having trouble clearing her throat (too bad she didn't drink a tall glass of orange juice before entering the recording booth). Otherwise, the arrangements on the ""good half"" of the album are very good."
2,"Good CD, Bad seller","CD was fine. Paid full price and got a damaged CD case. If they sell junk, it should be at a discount, and they shouldn't pass it off as ""new"" condition. Did I mention that the seller was Amazon?"
2,gas tank woes,"I think I like the Swisher - if I coluld only get to use it. After just a few hours of use, gas leaked out of the tank and when i took it off I discovered the tank was defective and had a weak spot in it that melted through hence leaking the gas. Sounds dangerous, doesn't it? I have ordered a new tank, but two weeks leter I am still waiting on its arrival. Getting parts is not that easy, as Swisher buys its engines from Briggs & Stratton. The end result - I'm not a happy mower."
4,Open season,Enjoyed the constant suspense and the characters. Good read. Did not see the outcome which is always a plus. Hate being able to figure it all out.
3,A book for slow readers,Story format was fine. Kept wanting to speed up the action especially in the area of detail. Would read another book of this author.
4,open season,i enjoyed the book. the story was good. i liked that it didnt make the police perfect it showed that they are human and can make mistakes.
4,open season,"not what i was expecting, kept me thinking as to who done it all the way to the end, great reading kept me entertained all the way through"
4,liked it,"good read I am 50+ female and enjoyed reading it and shared with co workers, they enjoyed too. Could not put down"
4,Open season,A very easy light read. I enjoyed reading it and look forward to reading more in the Joe Gunther series.
3,Not to exciting,I thought that there way to many detailed descriptions in this book and not enough suspense. The story line did not move along very fast.
4,Open Season,"I was intrigued with the plot, characters, and basic story. It kept my interest. I would recommend it to anyone who likes mysteries."
5,"Suspenseful, fast paced read!",This is the first Archer Mayor book I have read. I chose this book because it was free and less than ten pages into the book I was hooked. The main characters of the book are extremely detailed. Joe Gunther is a character with whom it is easy to identify. The action flows throughout the entire book. The twists and turns kept me waiting for the next page to find out what would happen next.
3,A good read,"I enjoyed this book by Archer Mayor. The characters are well developed and you get to know them and the plot is enough to keep you turning the pages. I enjoyed reading this mystery and a Joe Gunther novel.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"" and ""Wesley's Wars"""
1,Language,"I love a great mystery but I don't like foul language or sex in my books. Oddly, blood and gore don't bother me. This said, within the 1st chapter there was some foul language was used so I stopped reading."
2,I didn't finish it,I only got through 3 chapters. The book did not capture my attention so I decided not to waste my time.
4,Open season,"Good reading. The book kept my interest throughout. Well written , interesting characters with a good plot , and solution."
3,Open Season,The book was a little hard to follow at first. But after a few chapter was hard to put down. I would recommend this book to mystery buffs.
2,Slow Read,"I found this book and author by accident and figured I'd give the book a chance. It's a very slow read, and it's written in the first person which doesn't help it along at all. The story line seems to be missing some clarity. The book ends in a very awkward way, like you don't feel like the book is actually finished. I don't anticipate reading any more by this author unless it's very highly recommended."
3,Was ok but nothing great,"This book was ok, but really wasn't as riviting as I would like. At one point it was very good, and I felt that I couldn't put it down, then the author just went on a tangent and all the action faded and it started to loose my interest."
5,Open Season,"Seriously, if this book wouldn't have been free for my Kindle I would have NEVER bought it. And that would have been a major loss on my behalf. I can not believe I had never heard of Archer Mayor or the Joe Gunther series before this!! It is an EXCELLENT series. Archer Mayor has an ability to make you vividly see in your mind the words you are reading on the page. This is the very first book in the Joe Gunther Mysteries and it is a must read. I hope you fall in love with this series as well."
4,Good detective story that could easily be updated,"Written in 1988 there are no cell phones when needed, and the forensic part is now out of date because it does not refer to DNA evidence - they are still comparing blood types. Since this is an ebook (uploaded and downloaded and not printed) it could easly be brought up to date by the author with minor modifications. If you are not bothered by these facts the story is good and very inventive - good reading."
1,Open season,I liked this book. It was a fast read. I would definitely read more from this author. I like his pic.
4,Good mystery,I enjoyed the story; just enough twists to keep you interested. Good character development. Minimal bad language; not a fan of too much profanity.
4,Very good read.,Mayor weaves a believable plot around Gunther. Nice detailing to put the reader into the book's environment. Action moves along quickly enough to keep the reader eager . Looking forward to the next Gunther book.
4,Excellent first novel ofJoe Gunther,"I really enjoyed reading this Archer Mayer novel. It is the first book in the Archer Mayer series. Place in the 1980s, there are no cell phones or GPS systems. There is just feet on the ground detective work, come rain, snow or dark of night! As you move through this fast-paced tale, the plot keeps adding unexpected twists and turns. The evil villain stays a step ahead of Gunther until the very end, and appears to know so much more than anyone else, almost beyond possibility. But, I have known US veterans of Special Ops who really did know so much more than the rest of us, that if they had turned toward the darkside, they would have been just as difficult to defeat. Suspend your New Millennial technological know-how, and drop back a few decades to solve crime along with Gunther in a snowy Vermont winter!"
5,Well Done!,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Moves right along and keeps you on the edge of your seat right to the very end.
4,Nicely crafted mystery,"Really enjoyed the author's use of the language to build pictures and atmosphere in the book.Characters were OK, but loved the story line.I'd look for more Joe Gunther books from this author."
4,Comparable to Others,"Archie Mayor's first book in the Joe Gunther series was a freebie I picked up here at Amazon. Within 10 minutes of reading I was more into it, than many other boos I read of the same mystery/thriller genre I can find at the local Walgreens. Settings were well described (I feel - though I have never been to Vermont) though character development was a bit lacking. I did find myself liking the whole... solidarity of the Joe Gunther character. How he could non-emotionally take control of things, and yet lack the short-sightedness of ""being human"".I had a hard time putting this first book - of the series down, and constantly reminded myself it was similar to a John Sandford, with his ""...Prey"" series. Definitely something I will be following more of, and look forward to how the series continues (as I have not read any others yet)."
4,Great Read,Open SeasonThe book was suspenseful and kept my interest. I did not expect the twist and turns. Great read.
4,A great first book in a terrific series,This is a terrific series. Archer Mayor is an extremely readable writer and his plots are well thought out. I enjoyed this book and would highly recommend to anybody who likes well done work. It's a keeper.
3,Engaging story with believable characters,"I love mystery and suspense novels and I used to live in Vermont, so I thought this one would interest me. It was an engaging read that got me hooked and reeled me in so that I couldn't put it down. There were some situations and some character flaws that bothered me, but overall, it was a good read. It was definitely written by a man with a masculine audience in mind, though. How long about was this book written (or when was it supposed to have been set)? I ask because it's been a LONG time since an expensive home went for only $200,000 - even in the middle of Vermont where real estate is less expensive. I think it was supposed to have been set in the late 80's (based on the fact that it mentions something occurred in 1983), but nowhere is that made clear beforehand."
3,Pretty Good Book,"I'd buy more Archer Moore, Joe Gunther, books. Kept me entertained while trying to figure out ""who dunnit"".Bob Garramone"
5,Awesome!,Great mystery writer! I strongly recommend this author for serious mystery readers. His plotting is most ingenious and intriguing. I have a difficult time putting his books down.
2,Its Okay,"Mr. Mayor does not do much to describe the characters, leaves missing wondering the whole time what these characters look like. The plot is okay and some characterizations are unique. I almost didn't finish it."
4,New author,"I liked this book, it had a bit of a back and forth nature to it and was better when read for a length of time rather than over a few lunch hours. Left me guessing on how it was going to finish."
4,Good,I liked this book and his style of writing. I would read more in this series. Living in New England makes the story seem real.
4,Open Season,"I like crime books and in particular those that centre around a police detective. I found Archer Mayor Joe Gunther books to buy but noticed that to purchase they started from series #2. To get the general idea I wanted to check our the first book and found it in Amazon as a free Kindle instal. I was quite impressed with that and naturally ordered it and read it. I liked it very much. The character of Joe Gunther is very believable, the style of writing easy to read, the plot and side plots very good. So I have now purchased all the other Joe Gunther series and and looking forward to reading the rest. The lead character is very interesting, I would recommend that you start with Open Season and see whether it is what you would like. I think like me, you will get hooked into the rest."
3,Not Bad,"I was looking for a new series to read and this one was OK. I probably won't read any others in the series, but this book passed the time admirably."
3,Not bad for a free book,This book is a little slow but gets better. The author spends a lot of time describing the Scenery and gets off course of the plot. Overall it a ok book.
5,Fantastic!,"Great novel by a local author in Vermont. Kept me guessing and looking forward to continuing with this series, character, and author."
4,Captivating,"The story is slow in spots but, overall it is a very captivating book. I enjoy the charactors and the plot is very good."
3,Open Season (Joe Gunther),This book was okay but I would not recommend to a friend. Too many details about things that were not really relevant details.
4,Open season,"Fast paced. Would have liked more character development.for example, why was Stark such a monster? Why did his wife allow it? Would recommend it."
3,Open Season,"Enjoyed the characters,the pace, and the story. Kept me interested. I'd definitely pick up another book by this author. Recommend"
4,Good suspense,"Enjoyed the characters,the pace, and the story. Kept me interested. I'd definitely pick up another book by this author. Recommend."
5,Fabulous,"Joe Gunther is a very determined man, regardless of the consequences he determined to solve this case. This book held my interest to the very end, I will definitely read the series."
3,Ok...but not great,"While the story has potential, at times the writing was lacking. The main character is flat and ordinary. I would be interested in seeing if the authors style improved in the next few books."
4,GOOD TWISTY STORYLINE,"THIS IS A GOOD TWISTY STORYLINE, A LITTLE TOO LONG AND DRAWN OUT THOUGH. I ENJOYED IT A LOT, BUT WAS READY FOR IT TO END. IT SEEMES LIKE TOO MANY CHARACTERS IN THE PLOT AND SOME WERE NEVER DEVELOPED COMPLETELY. BUT, THIS BOOK HAD LOTS OF ACTION AND VERY FAST PACED WHICH I LIKED A LOT, DIALOGUE WAS QUICK AND EASY TO FOLLOW. REALLY A GOOD READ......"
4,Very good read,This book was a real page turner. First time I have read Archer Mayor and look forward to another book.
3,Lost interest a few times,Not a horrible book but at times I had to force myself to keep reading. Ending was unsatisfactory and abrupt.
4,Good read,"It started out slow, but as the story progressed, it was better. I really like this book and I look forward to reading more books by this author."
2,Very slow,This book felt like it dredged on for days. I skipped a bunch of pages simply because the description of the setting was too detailed. I wouldn't recommend this book.
4,Found a new series.,"I am still reading this but so far am very happy with the story line and the main character. I am not a big fan of series but it seems more and more authors are going that route. Will get another ""Gunther"" story when I finish this one. Hopefully it will be as good as or better then what I'm reading now."
4,A Pleasant Read...,"I needed another bullet in my 'time at the coffee shop' holster, and downloaded this novel to my kindle without much research. I'm glad that I did. I found the story well written and engaging, the plot line solid and entertaining, and for me the suspense mounted until the final chapter. I'll likely read more in this series."
2,Slow read,"Even though Joe Gunther seems like an interesting character, I found the book too long and boring at times. I can read a good book in 1-2 days, This book took me 3 weeks. In fact I almost deleted it part way through. Way too much detail, Seems like he just filled in with too many descriptions of location.I'm glad this was a free book or I would be very disappointed to have paid money for it."
4,OPEN SEASON,Very well written and keeps your interest all the way thru. Enough twists & turns to keep you from figuring it out.
5,Open Season,"One of those books that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through, cant wait to read the next one."
4,Lots of interesting twists,"This was a pretty good book. Liked the main character quite a bit, and the story kept you guessing what was going to happen next. Like a lot of current books, though, the bad guy in this one was just a little beyond believable, though I will probably consider other offerings from this author."
3,Pick up the pace,The book was okay but just okay. It did not move fast enough for my taste. I like a book that grabs you from the start and keeps you going all the way through.
4,enjoyed this one,This one had a plot that was not predictable and I liked the lead character. I will look for more Joe Gunther books in the future.
3,Entertaining,"The story was a bit slow at the beginning. The plot became a bit incredible toward the end. The characters are realistic and the description of Vermont makes you feel like you've been to Brattleboro for a visit. Overall, an entertaining story."
2,Very disappointing cd,"I was very let down when I listened to this cd. There were some songs like ""Lady"" and ""Gotham"" that I just couldn't stand. I don't like cd's where there are alot of unnesssary vocal noises, ""ooohs,bahp bahp"", type of stuff that really wreck the songs. There are many smooth jazz artists I find guilty of this. Anyway, the first three songs were decent, as was the last song. I found that the songs I hated were enough that they detracted from the entire cd. In all fairness tho, the title song, Mediterraneo, is beautiful."
2,"Lots of potential, somewhat of a disappointment","There are some excellent ideas and potential in here, but the CD is marred by a few fatal flaws.1. Endings of the songs - there are only 3 songs that have endings. The rest just ""fade out."" It gets very annoying having song after song fade out without any conclusive ending. 3 out of 11 is not very many.2. There are a few songs that introduce one theme and repeat it needlessly. Songs like ""Cuba Nova"" and ""Gotham"" have good ideas, but need more variation. And you guessed how they end - fade out.3. The entire album is a bit short - 47 minutes. That's a little more than half of what the CD can hold.I think Marc should have developed some of his ideas a bit more and come up with some memorable endings for the songs. This could be a 5 star CD; Marc's very talented (don't try to play along on the guitar - very hard), but the disc needs a little refining."
5,awesome bath wipes,"These dog wipes are really awesome. I have used many different brands for in between bathing and there is not one so far that even compares with these wipes. I have been searching all over the internet trying to find this particular brand and product, and I am ordering several today. They're nice and thick, and just the right size for my doxies, have a really nice scent, and my two dogs love the rubdown they get!! It leaves their coats clean, soft and shiny. It is great for in between bathes. I love it!! I am totally sold and highly recommend this product. You won't be sorry you bought these."
5,Nice and thick,These are great wipes for your dog between bath when they get a little dirty from being outside. They are nice and thick and moist. I'll definitely be ordering more when I use all I currently have.
4,"Beautiful ankle bracelet, difficult clasp","While I love this ankle bracelet, the clasp is very difficult to maneuver. Easier for a necklace, but getting around it on an ankle is tough."
4,right angled adapters,"These took a while to find, but I had to have something to fit in a very tight space. They fit perfectly and are working like a charm."
1,Hilariously awful!,What a waste of 36 minutes. Filmed and narrated by a truly unhelpful couple with nothing of any interest to say to a potential tourist. One half of the film was night time on the beach and the rest on a trip up Sugarloaf mountain in a driving rainstorm and fog so thick you couldn't see the view. This resembled a boring neighbor's gastly home movie--don't spend your money.
1,Awful!!,"I'm Brazilian and I've never seen such a bad movie about Rio. Very poor quality of images, not interesting at all. The couple just used their amateur videos from their trip and put into this film. Don't reccomend to anyone."
3,Package Price,"See ""pricing question"" entry from 1/13/06...I was wondering the same thing...why is the package price of 3 DVD's more than the sum of them purchased separately?I think it's a question for Amazon to answer."
4,Pricing Question,"Can someone explain why buying volumes 1, 2 & 3 separately is $ 33.05 less than the 3 volumes combined? Based on the individual pricing, the total is $ 141.94."
4,Amazon lowered the price.,"Volumes 1-3 were a total of $129.54 with Super Saver Shipping. If you order each volume separately or purchase Volume 1-2 and add Volume 3, either way they are more expensive and cost about $140.00. Amazon must have listened to some of the complaints.I grew up loving Looney Tunes, especially Bugs and wanted to share them with my daughter who is nine. She loves watching Looney Tunes and seems to prefer them over the cartoons that are on currently on TV."
5,"Film school in a box (well, three boxes actually)","Want to know more about angles, shot selection, juxtaposition? Want to funkify your visual style and frame shots more creatively? Want to strip the fat off of your stories so they're lean and mean? Want a crash course in what is required for screen performance and what is not? DON'T SPEND MONEY ON FILM SCHOOL! Watch the Looney Tunes collection a couple dozen times and leave your hundred grand in the bank! This is Sergeant Peppers for comedy. This is ground zero for tight, hilarious, audacious, sadistic, anti-establishment HILARIOUS (I said it again) visual storytelling. ""Benjamin Button""? Bah! Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you, ""One Froggy Evening"". Enough said."
2,Wrong Colour versus Advertisment,The gauge I received had a silver face and not the black face as shown in the listing. So now I have a silver gauge amongst a group of 5 other black face gauges. Not worth the hassle and trouble to return it.
2,went out with a whimper,"This is Naked Raygun's last studio record, and the only record they recorded without longtime guitarist John Haggerty (who went on to form the excellent Pegboy).The loss of such a key member really shows on this record; the recording sounds flat and uninspired, and the songs aren't really memorable, (""Home"" being the notable exception.)I'm not writing a review to simply slag this record, I'm trying to warn potential new fans, that this is the one bad record to avoid. Lots of great bands put out a stinker, and this happens to be Naked Raygun's.Pick up any of their 4 previous records: Throb Throb, All Rise, Jettison, and Understand. All of those records get 5 out of 5 stars in my book."
3,It's not that bad!,"The production is rather muddy and Raygun just isn't the same without John Haggerty on guitar, but a good 50% of the songs are worthy of being called Raygun songs. Still better than 95% of the punk out there."
1,The End of a great Band,"No good songs, every other album is ten times better. Do not buy this, it should never have been a Raygun album. Too bad they didn't break up sooner."
4,NICE BUT...,"IT'S A GREAT BAND, GREAT MUSIC, GREAT SONGS, BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE THEIR MOST IMPORTANT AND POPULAR SONG: ""PSYCHOBILLY FREAKOUT"", CAN NOT BELIEVE IT!, WHY, THIS ""20TH CENTURY MASTERS"" RECORD LABEL MUST BE THIRSTY AND NEED PLENTY OF WATER TO DRINK, BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO HELL!!!"
2,Mildly amusing but not great,"This is a mildly amusing novel, with the humor mostly arising from the narrator's wry point of view. But ultimately the plot is pointless, and the character is irritatingly hapless and self-lacerating. He makes it clear that his problems are all self-induced, which becomes a little tiresome. I found the biographical sections about Kate Bush quite interesting, but subsequently learned from [...] that the author repeats some untrue minor facts from other published sources. The best part of the novel was the sense of camaraderie the protagonist has with all the Kate Bush fans he encounters--the most unlikely characters discuss her music in great detail in the most unlikely situations. It's a delightful premise, but not quite enough to make the book entirely successful."
2,Very disappointing,"I was under the impression that the book was mostly about Kate Bush. It's not. So DO NOT read it if that is what you are looking for. The book itself is mildy amusing at best. Most of the time it is just boring, irritating and it lacks creativity."
2,Bad Clasp,This button has a straight pin that pierces the cloth and is fastened by a clasp on the back. The clasp that came with this particular pin did not properly 'pinch' the pin on the button. I had to use the clasp from another pin in order to fasten it properly. This is not to say that all of the clasps that come from this company are faulty. This review merely reflects my personal experiences.
4,Dog loves this toy but...............,"We have a larger dog, approx. 70 lbs. He loved this toy, but he destroyed it in a matter of seconds. He also ate a lot of the string and stuffing inside the toy, which made him a little sick. Not sure it's the best toy for a larger dog."
1,Hated it. I didn't like the main characters or the story.,"There was too much crude, vulgar and foul language. I recently read a different book, where I actually enjoyed the swearing by one of the characters, but not so in this book. It was unpleasant. I had no sympathy for the main character, Julie, who worked in a chain restaurant. The manager and fellow workers treated her unfairly and badly. I couldn't believe that she didn't try to find another waitress job. She becomes a pretend girlfriend for a famous movie star, whom I don't like. I also didn't like Julie's girlfriend Billie who partners with Julie to get free stuff from retail stores simple because Julie is the girlfriend of a movie star. This book was not fun or interesting. Sexual language: none other than vulgar swearing. Number of sex scenes: none. Setting: current day U.S. Copyright: 2005. Genre: contemporary romance."
4,Steve Howe: The Man & His Guitars,"Altho' pretty barebones as far as DVD features go, this DVD is more about Steve Howe talking about how he began to play the guitar and then goes through an overview of his career up and until the late 80s, prior to ABWH merging into the UNION lineup. In addition to Howe being interviewed, he performs some acoustic songs and some excerpts from solo songs, Yes songs, and even GTR. His role in Asia isn't given too much discussion, but he does offer some interesting insights as to why the original band dissolved so quickly. For the most part, the DVD concentrates on his work with Yes - which I'm sure will please the audience for this DVD. At about an hour, this is a good little DVD to pick up if you're a big Steve Howe fan."
3,POCA EJECUCION DE LO ESPERADO,"SINCERAMENTE, COMPRE ESTE DVD PENSANDO, EN VER A STEVE EJECUTANDO MAS PIEZAS MUSICALES PARA PODER APRECIAR MAS AUN SU EXCELENTE VIRTOUSIDAD CON LAS CUERDAS, PERO LO QUE PUDE OBSERVAR, ES MAS BIEN UNA BIOGRAFIA DE SU TRAYECTORIA ARTISTICA.LASTIMA QUE NO SE PUEDA VER SI QUIERA UNA PIEZA COMPLETA QUE NO SEA UNA SIMPLE TOCADA DE LAS CUERDAS YA QUE SU TALENTO ES MUY POCO COMUN."
4,GET YOUR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA -- get a life not just a job,"You need to get a life not just a job. It will be crucial to even be considered for a job in this day and age. It's also a great supplment to chapter 7 of my current book which is on Wealth and Wellness, you can never undestimate the value of education which is PRICELESS -- see more info about why you need to update your skills and create multiple income streams"
2,Don't buy,"As a Kiss fan, I'm not familiar with a lot of the songs on this album. I don't like these covers. Then songs like ""Foxy Lady"" and ""Going Blind"" are covered, which have been covered so many times."
2,Well written but very biased,"This book gives good coverage of it.s subject, but is biased from start to finish. It is also inconsistant. First it claims Thompson is working long hours and struggling to get by, and then it has him traveling endlessly with the Klan and spending all kinds of money on it.Thompson has a lot of personal turmoil in his life due to the death of his son, marital problems, and alcoholism. He finds a feeling of self importance as a Klan leader and quits when the thrill wears off. Did he ever really believe in the Klan or was it a form of escapism from his personal problems? Worth Weller makes it plain from the start that he isn't sympathetic to right wing political movements. He seems to think the social problems the KKK confronts are in the Klan's imagination. Even if you don't agree with the Klan's solutions or approach, anti-white discrimination, racial tension, and government corruption are very real major problems that concern all Americans."
2,Useless information,"I bought this book seeking a source of information on civil airplanes, not WW2 and earlier military AC. I am in the market for another plane for my own use and that will most certainly not be a FW190 or a Corsair.Combined with some obvious typo errors that should have been corrected in earlier editions, I would not recommend this book."
4,fun,need a little more detal like aircraft options avable for the moters and insterment some things are not corrent in ti but alll and alll it gits it close
1,Spectacular example of very long sentences,"Nobody writes longer sentences than this man did. If there is ever a TV contest show for smart kids diagramming sentences, the works of Allan would be ideal subject material."
2,"Rambling, full of pomo silliness/jargon, disappointing","I wanted to learn about racism and xenophobia in Sweden.I didn't learn much from this book.It is not a study at all -- it isn't really even social science -- but rather, a whimsical and often psychedelic collection of random quotes from people like Kant and Myrdal, various pseudo-intellectual poems (yes, poems), and stream-of consciousness musings on the nature of racism and ""the Other."" The pomo style is truly annoying.I am certain that that author put his heart into this book, and I give him credit for trying to do something ""new"" and ""original"" -- but the result left me extremely bummed. I regret buying the book."
2,Much smaller than anticipated,This bowl is very small - much too small to hold even a modest amount of soup. Make sure you review the actual dimensions of the bowl before you purchase.
2,NOT a collectors reference,"Although it's a nice little book with lots of lovely pictures, this is not a useful reference for collectors. It gives some nice background on several (but by no means all) well-known manufacturers, and lists some of their current offerings. But as far as a rundown on many more models, don't look here. Pricing is extremely vague--more like movie ratings, with one to five stars showing the range of prices for current models. The index is terrible--hardly anything there, the table of contents lists only the major sections of the book, not each subdivision of individual manufacturers, and there are no useful running headers or footers to help you know what section you're in when flipping through the book. The pocket size is deceptive in that it really isn't a pocket reference. More of a mini coffee table book. Buy it if you already own a decent reference and like the idea of having a little book with pretty pictures in it."
2,Unfair!,"This is pretty much a jazz trio (with a drummer)... that's a marked departure from the classical saxophone quartet which The Fairer Sax otherwise masquerade as.The quartet has recorded two vibrant classical albums (yes):[1] Diversions with The Fairer Sax (1987)[2] The French Collection (1990)The other two albums consist of jazzy cabaret music (no):[3] Blowing Hot and Cool (1989)[4] Comparing Notes (1991)The classical style is their forte (you know, its fairer than all that jazz)...___________________"
4,Soft and Fun to Play,My son loves his pet frog that he got for Christmas. It is so soft and he enjoys playing the online games.
5,Webkinz Tree Frog,"Well made, bright colors, hours of entertainment for kids that love the virtual world of Webkinz. We ordered 4 pets and love this one the best!"
4,bought for my daughter,"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday which isn't until November, I bought it has kind of a gag gift she'd freak everytime she saw a frog around the swimming pool.She likes tree frogs though so I decided to get her one."
3,Frogtastic,"The Webkinz Tree Frog was a great value for the money. My friend loves frogs and so we got it for him. He loves the Webkinz online world allowing him to escape from school to a fun, safe, educational world."
2,"Well written, but biased","If you are looking for a reason to tell a patient not to use any alternative medicine, this is your book. If, however, you'd like a book on safe and effective alternative medicine, as the title suggests, you will be disappointed. This text appears to be funded by one or more pharmaceutical interest. When studies that support the efficacy of a particular therapy are actually mentioned, they are later brought into question. However, even the most anecdotal negative study will be highlighted. The message of this book is: There is no alternative medicine. Sadly, there seems to be no source that will fairly assess the risks and the rewards of alternative therapy. Keep looking."
5,Best alternative medicine book I have read so far,"Best alternative medicine book I have read so far. I have a whole bookcase full of herbal books and this is the number one book. The book does not have any photos for identification. Of course, that is not the intent of the book. It is mainly written to show the chemically active ingredients of herbs. This to me is important."
3,light weight sunglasses,I have owned Oakley Blades and Smith HP sunglases which have a simular style. They seem to be good quality but I feel the lenses are too small. The major complaint I have is the nose pieces which literally disolved after only 4 months of use: unaceptable; they should last years. I also don't know where to get replacementsnlike oakey and Smith which have detachable nose pieces the Bolles nose pieces attach directly to the frame. These glasses are good value with 3 sets of lenses and the lenses are far easier to change than Oakley or Smith. I would not buy these again because of the poor quality and design of the nose piece which was probably made in China
5,Very nice,Very nice. They fit perfectly and they are exactly as I imagined them. The sun is blocked as it is required.
5,Great swim trainer!,"My daughter started using this at 13 months old and has loved being independent in the pool ever since. At first she was a little unstable (would roll forward or to the side) but she has since been able to ""feel"" the water and help herself balance by using her arms and legs. A great teaching tool for water independence! I also enjoy being able to kick laps while pushing her in the swim sweater."
3,close supervision necessary,"of course there needs to be close supervision in a pool setting. however, i was hoping this product would allow my son (2yrs 29 lbs) a little more freedom. the product makes my son tip forward, so it is necessary to have a hand on the front of the raft at all times. i was hoping he could kick around a bit, but i need to be right there with him so he doesn't tip forward and get a mouth full of water. i will continue to use this product but i was a bit disappointed."
1,Never again,"Sent me a headband not a wristband. Customer service was no help and never accepted the fact they sent me the wrong item when it clearly says wrist sweatband in the description. I personally would never deal with this company again. All this grief for a sweatband, really?"
1,Ripped Off!,"Hello...I placed my order, was billed and then stiffed! After not receiving the product for a couple weeks I emailed the seller. I was told it was ""out of their hands"". Unfortunatley the same can't be said for my money!"
1,Neither Light nor Darkness!,"Having read most, if not all, of Milton Osborne's previous books on Cambodia and S.E. Asia, I found this book a big disappointment. The author seems to have re-written chapters from a previous book and added a few new ones but did not undertake new research for this book about Prince (now King) Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia. I served as Private Secretary to King Sihanouk from 1981-1991 and I believe that the Cambodian monarch is a much misunderstood monarch. Certainly not a perfect human being but neither a ""prince of darkness"". It is a great pity that Osborne does not pay much attention to Sihanouk's leading role in bringing a certain peace to Cambodia and the special role he has played in protecting and nurturing the newly acquired democratic rights of all Cambodians."
4,"a good album, maybe their best","I saw Superchunk several times in the late 1980s, 1990, and 1991. This album strikes me as their best work. Often called ""Muppet Rock,"" because of the upbeat nature of many of their tunes, I guess (unless it was the bouncing around on stage...), the tunes are bouncy, the lyrics are personal, and yes, it's sort of punkish.""Skip Steps 1 and 3"" seemed to be the tune of the day on college radio, but I came to like ""Cast Iron"" and ""Punch Me Harder"" better.It was hard to beat The Chunk for pure energy back in that day. It's still a fun listen."
5,My 3rd favorite of 5 SUPERCHUNK albums.,"And it's the albums that are the strongest. I got most of the eps and each one is, to me, half great songs and half nothin' much songs. This albums, however, is very strong. Rather than petering out after about 5 songs I really like the first 11 of 12, and the first 9 even better. They hit me in the right groove, guitars that don't quit, a vocals I like, and music that has a strong indie rock sound. Lyrically, it's ok, though, I gotta admit, lyrics, in general, have little interest for me. At church when the band that sounds like SMASHING PUMPKINS has worship lyrics, then it hits it for me. Still, this album, if you want movin' sounds, that is, not slow stuff, fun occasional harmony and a real modern American sound, this is it. Sure, on occasion they slow down a bit, but usually this is driving music, perfect for the road really, if you ask me. chrisbct@hotmail.com"
3,"Not bad, but tries too hard","I hate to be critical of a book that is so grand in its scope, but there are things that just do not set right in this one. The good points: interesting characters, detailed motivations, and a generally captivating story. The bad points: a very annoying almost voice-over type narration that creeps in occasionally, the author's constant desire to impress us with the books he's read and, after all the wordiness that comes before it, a very tidy, pat little ending. However, this is not a bad book and there is stuff to enjoy. Just don't feel badly when you want to skip a few pages or if you have the desire to roll your eyes at some of the conceit."
5,compelling,interesting insight and description of the meth addicted lifestyle of a gay man in san francisco. haunting imagery that stays long after one sets down the novel.
2,I've read better,"The premise of this book is so complex that the author gets lost in in sorting out his own plot line. You want to like the characters but they are so superficially self absorbed, I couldn't skip pages fast enough to get to the end."
4,Fascinating,"A fascinating look into one woman's life as a Mormon. This is not your typical praise or bash book. It is instead a look at the life of a woman who loves her religion and her lifestyle, but can question it at the same time. A must-read."
2,Sludgy slush,"Typical in an overhyped, flavor-of-a-moment way, where so much feels irrelevant or downright ugly-edgy in an attempt to subvert the lack of real talent (hear how the intro sounds like TVOTR's- who can be overpraised in their own right- retarded step cousin)...but, including just enough compelling musical insight throughout the jagged and jaded indulgence to wearily lead me into a final, (beginning of) track where he seemingly ""gets it"" and places ingredients of doom, bloom, and boom optimally."
3,hard to install,"I tried to install software on my XP, but has some error, not I put it aside, it wastes my money."
5,Great,"Item did not have software for it to operate with Windows 7. It was my fault, I didn't read all the specs before I hit the Buy it Now button. Seller did provide a link for me to use to download software. Link didn't work. Seller did offer a refund. I haven't gotten around to sending it back yet. Sending it back would cost almost as much as the item itself. Seller worked well with me. Was great!"
1,DOES NOT WORK IN WIN7,I got this years ago and tried to use it in win7 with my BT headphones. It does not work.
1,Not happy,The adaptor seems to work but it's hard to tell because the software for it doesn't do what motorola says it does. Motorola support is non- existant. One of the support people I talked to said she would find out what was wrong and call me back. I never heard from her. I sent email and never was answered. Don't buy anything made by Motorola.
3,WORKING WITH WINDOWS VISTA,"Believe it or not, I FINALLY GOT THE PC850 to work with windows vista. I can connect to my cell phone and everything!"
4,Worked As Advertised,"I am not sure what I am comparing this product to, since it is my first experience with Bluetooth technology. The product was easy to install, and worked as advertised. I was quickly able to connect my phone and headphones to my computer. What I didn't anticipate was the relative slowness of Bluetooth compared to my wireless G network. This is not the connection that you would want to use to download music or any other large files of data to your phone. I gave up on trying to download a song to my phone after several minutes. It is much faster to use the USB interface. However, Bluetooth is a convenient way to synchronize your phone's calendar, or download a 20 second ring tone. Bottom line, the product does what it is supposed to do."
4,Bluetooth Hotsync Interface for Palm 650 PDA,"I bought this to try as an alternative to performing a USB hotsync from my Palm 650 to my old Pentium III Compaq desktop running Windows XP. The Bluetooth interface works fine (it works slower than the USB cable connection, but the downloading is simple when it's cable-less)."
1,NO VISTA SUPPORT,"This product DOES NOT work with Windows Vista ""Any Addition""BEWARE if you intend to use it with Vista, it DOES NOT work!"
3,Rough around the edges - but useful,"Still a new and not-so-user-friendly technology. But if you're fairly tech-savvy and willing to take the time to figure out the bells and whistles, this can be a very useful device if you have many bluetooth enabled products including those not made by motorola. For instance it took some playing around with to figure out how to get it to sync with the palm OS software on my smart phone. It's great for music headphones if you got them. But the catch is you can't listen to music with bluetooth stereo headphone and sync your pda at the same time - the music get very choppy. The software (like some of the other reviewers said) seems it has a lot of bugs with no downloadable drivers from the website. If this is the case I think this should help:[...]It's a 130MB downloadable "".ZIP"" file that (I think) is more updated than what the product comes with. BEWARE it's still not compatible for Vista users."
1,PROBABLY A GREAT PRODUCT BUT.....,"This is probably a great product but I realized after it finally got to my house and I ripped open the packaging that it doesn't work with WINDOWS VISTA. Motorola has announced it is releasing a new bluetooth adapter with Windows Vista support rather than updating the software for this particular model (PC850). So if you have windows VISTA heed my warning, save yourself the time and the money and get a different model or brand and make sure it is compatible (on the products webpage) before you purchase any product."
2,Maternity pants,"While these pants fit my daughter (she is a young teacher), she won't wear them because they are SO OUTDATED! They appear to be from the 1980's. They were very inexpensive however!"
1,can't complain about service cos trere are none,Not yet received need tracking number date date date date date date date date date date date date date date date date date
1,Never again !!!,"I enjoyed this series with its light hearted and somewhat goofy story-lines, but when they introduced a hom0sexua1 character, I said... Here we go again.I get sick of the subtle indoctrination which is intended to make the people see hom0sexua1s as normal and good and even superior.In this series the hom0sexua1 is the one with the clearest moral compass... He was ultimately the ""good"" guy.If they would have left the hom0sexua1 stuff out, the stories would have still worked and no one would have been blindsided by the in-you-face perversion promotion.I will not buy any more of these DVDs.Judgment on this country is coming SOON !!!"
2,Good season but got bad discs!,"Warehouse 13 is good entertainment that combines humor and action. So when the dvd comes out, I quickly add it to my collection. Sad to say Amazon was dealt a bad hand with the discs I got. Discs 2 and 3 both were damaged (major scratches) requiring their return. It looks like it happened at the manufacturing facility as it came sealed and was inside a insulated bag. Bummer to say the least. On the plus side I will be able to view the Season 3 episodes-elsewhere via streaming- so I will not miss out completely. If you order the discs, be sure to inspect the discs immediately to make sure there are no problems. I hope what happened was isolated to this one package but sometimes things can go wrong."
2,"Was $16.99, now $24.99","If you didn't order this HD streaming version before early July, you now get to pay the $8 premium. Streaming is now the same price as a DVD, so take your pick.Of course, the show itself is lots of fun!Edit: Apparently waiting until after release means you get to pay less for streaming ($19.99), and more for the DVD ($39)!"
5,Prepare for Laughter,Any fan of Warehouse 13 will not be disappointed with this years Christmas Episode. It's heart warming and funny at the same time. Reality minus Pete being born is a hoot; check out the picture of the President behind Myka's desk in her office; this sets the pace for the laughter. I highly recommend this episode.
5,COPY CAT,I love it when networks play copycat. It's always interesting to see the similarities and differences. This episode copies the new season of Fringe in which Peter Bishop shows up in everyone's lives and no one knows him.
2,Something has been misplaced.,"Season 1 was very entertaining, Season 2 was pretty good, but Season 3 demonstrates that Warehouse 13 has lost an indefinable something. Something has changed in the running/writing of the show that has lost some kind of synergy. Save your money, Amazon will have this on sale for 20 bucks soon enough."
5,WAREHOUSE 13 SEASON 3,I LOVE THIS SERIES THE SEASON FINALLY WAS AWESOME I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT SEASON WHICH STARTS JULY 23 CALLED NEW HOPE I SURE HOPE THAT JINX IS BROUGHT BACK I LOVE HIS INTERACTION WITH CLAUDIA GREAT SHOW I JUST PRE ORDERED SEASON 3 THE PRICE DROPPED TO 24.99***UPDATE*** GOT DVD GREAT SET IT CONTAINS ONE CHRISTMAS SHOW(SECRET SANTA) WHICH WAS FROM SEASON 2 I GUESS IT A WONDERFUL LIFE ONE WILL COME WITH SEASON 4 ALSO JINX WILL BE BACK SAW A GLIMPS OF HIM FROM RECORDED SEASON 3 THE STAND I ALSO HOPE THEY BRING BACK HG***spoiler alert***SEASON 4 OPENER A MUST SEE THIS SERIES IS THE BEST SHOW ON TV AT THIS TIME***HG IS BACK I LOVE ANY PROGRAM WITH TIME TRAVEL
3,Warehouse 13,We purchased this video for our grandson as a Christmas present. He was happy to receive it as he had two other videos that preceded this one.
5,It just keeps getting better,"Season two set a high bar for quality and enjoyment. Season three is even better. Good plots, good writing, good acting - this show has it all. This is SF for the thinking adult. Warehouse 13 is the best SF show in current production, and compares well to any other TV series now being produced."
5,One of my favorite shows.,"It was great to see this show available here. I've become hooked on this delightful, imaginative, and exciting sci-fi show."
4,I still could not pass the third episode of this season three,"The reason I bought this season 3 was because I truly liked the first two seasons; although I really don't like the main male character, so vulgar and childish to a disgusting point.But the third season seem so sluggish and out of new ideas or blatant bad ideas I would add. And I simply could not even finish watching the third episode of this season 3, so the jury is still out there :)"
3,Not bad,"I bought this book based on Leslie's book, Sister Got Game, which I loved.This story was much too convoluted for my taste - too many characters - hard to keep track. Disappointing ending"
5,LA Banks grabs you from begining to end,"Absolutely loved this book series!!!!! Betrayal Of the Trust makes you crave to read more, it makes you wonder about what happened to the characters and the story line.LA Banks (Leslie Esdaile Banks) does not disapoint her readers. She made this story line into a four book series. You would leave yourself hanging if you didn't seek out the other three books (the intrigue was just that good.)It is sad and unfortunate that she is no longer around to add to her amazing body of work (i.e. Vampire Huntress series) but her works lives on in this Crime Thriller series;Betrayal of the Trust, Blind Trust, Shattered Trust, No Trust."
2,BORING,"This book is so boring for me to get into. Usually I read a novel in a day or two, I have been reading this book for over a month because I just cant seem to get into it."
2,Not as good as her other work,"I read this book as it was a book club choice, otherwise I would not have finished the book. The beginning was very slow, though it picked up at the end. Ms. Banks is at her best when writing ""love"" scenes. True to form, Ms. Banks creates strong female characters. I very much enjoy her Vampire Huntress series and I highly recommend them."
4,Interesting,"I have never heard this story before of this scandelous hero.I'm sure different people would present different varietiesof this same story. I enjoyed it, however I am still notquite sure what to make of it. I would want to compare itwith different sources. I wonder how the Afghan peoplefeel toward Charlie Wilson."
1,"I'm Disappointed, History Channel","This felt more like a propaganda piece or a political ad for Charlie Wilson than a decent documentary.Joanne Herring, a described fervent anti-communist, was portraying facts of the war without any qualification. Charlie Wilson's entry into politics via emotional appeal and his social behavior while in office seemed to be portrayed more as a prank than as actual issues, even if irrelevant to the Afghan war.Unfortunately, I can't give a complete review of the film, as I turned it off 30 minutes in."
4,straightforward presentation... fascinating story...,"I haven't yet seen ""Charlie Wilson's War"" but I am watching the HIstory Channel's ""The Truth @ Charlie Wilson's War,"" which thankfully is free of the bombast that nearly spoils some History Channel documentaries. But then the presentation doesn't really need it. The real life Charlie Wilson's Afghanistan adventure makes for a wild story, complete with high class 'socialites' determining the fate of nations, party-boy politicians, drug use scandals, illegal arms smuggling operations, and the lives of millions on the line - at least the Afghans wanted Wilson's help (and that makes a big difference for me), and whatever has followed since, he definitely delivered, in his own unique way. There's nothing fancy about the storytelling here, but the story doesn't need the embellishment."
4,Charlie Wilsons War,Product was received on time and in good condition. The content was as expected and even though I had seen it before about 1 1/2 years ago I enjoyed seeing it once more. It makes one understand just how corrupt polatics realy is.
2,Not happy with gift,I bought this gift basket for my mothers birthday and was not happy with this purchase. When I saw the gift basket it looked very cheap and the products were not up to my standard of quality. The lotions were very watered down.
3,bright beauty,"Andre Breton was a cruel and stupid man. He was irresponsible in the fullest and truest sense of the term. If you ever decided to look up the word ""selfish"" in the dictionary you should not bother to be surprized when you see Breton's photograph.But even Breton - like all of us - was capable of stumbling across a masterpiece.Nadja is a star. Nadja is exactly the kind of girl that you would not like to bring home to mom - but you find yourself craving and loving her anyways.Nadja is a grotesque negative print - the kind of print that drives photographers mad. She is as wild as wild gets.Some time ago the diagnosis of ""hysteria"" meant something. That was back in the good old cruel days when mentally ill people were either celebrated or cursed. Nadja is worth both celebration and cursing. She is the Marilyn Monroe of surrealist objects.She is deranged, tormented when it does not matter, full of the heat of love."
4,gloves off!,"I absolutely love this book and recommend it to dreamers and people in love. I highlighted and wrote all over it, but haven't read it again which is why I only gave it 4 stars although it is surely due another read. It is a romantic book especially if you look art history b/c this book mention many Surrealist front runners. Yes, I am bias b/c I am an art history major but, it's entertaining and if you were ever a dreaming that wanted to run away leaving you less pragmatic side behind, this is a short novel for you!"
1,Beware of Shipping Cost!,"The shipping on this product was as much as the product. I was charged based on product weight of 10 lbs. when, in truth, the item weighs less than 1 lb.as packaged. The tank cover is fine but I will not buy merchandise from this provider again after such flagrant deception."
1,very bad waste of time and money,"i thoght this book would be more, but it was not. all it was, was a waste of time and money. i think my tailgate get togathers are much better. and further more where is the pro side all he talks about is the college game. so for all you future tailgater, walk around the parking lot of your favorite stadium take notes and go home and make your own plan from what you had seen. thats what i did i travled to numerous game and just took every thing in that the fans where doing. and my buddies will tell you they have a blast at the browns games when we tailgate. so my advice to you dont buy the book in fact i am sending mine back today if that tells you anything."
4,Quintessential indie-rock,"This record made me want to be something more than I was...its spirited playing, passionate lyrics, and warm, punchy bass tones that ring through your rib cage make this a record you'll keep listening to year after year...styles comes and go, great records stick around - this is one of them."
4,She's Entertainment!!,"Combine a fine stage singer and actress with a totally charming and beguiling raconteur, and you have Faith Prince on her CD, Leap of Faith, recorded live at Joe's Pub. Her song selection is delightful, her delivery of each number is sublime. She wisely keeps the proceedings simple and straightforward..and wonderful. Her tale of performing with Jack Jones is delicious; all of her stories are witty without being mean spirited. It's all great fun. I particularlly enjoy The Man With A Horn, with a very jazzy assist from her trumpeter husband, Larry Lunetta. The whole recording is marvelous, very enjoyable."
3,Better As A Studio Recording,"Ah, imagine these songs sung in a studio setting. Great repertoire indeed! Although much of the spoken stuff is funny there is far too much yakking between songs. Makes for not wanting to keep spinning and spinning this disc over and over again. Check out Nick & Nora, Falsettoland and Little Me cast recordings for some classic Faith Prince!"
1,Poor Representation of Talented Performer,"Faith Prince is one talented lady, but cabaret is not her strength. The song choices are not suited to Prince's voice, and there is entirely too much chit-chat recorded here."
4,Faith Is Wonderful,"This is a live recording of Faith Prince at Joe's Cafe, so there is some talking on it. Most of the people who have reviewed seemed to not like the chatting Faith does. I don't mind at all. The stories and the songs flow well, and even though Faith admits to being a ""cabaret virgin"", she does very well. Some of the songs are unfamiliar, but are very good, and the new jazzed up Adeline's Lament is a kick. Buy this, you won't be dissapointed."
4,A bigger fan now.,"Fantastically entertaining. Great music, unique voice, funny, funny lines; what a personality. This is one of the most enjoyable, from start to finish, CDs I have encountered in a long, long time. Congrats on a great solo debut CD. It's worth having."
2,Does not Work in LA,"Bought this for my car for driving around downtown Los Angeles. the 4 frequencies that the device operates on are always all filled, making it impossible to use for an Ipod since there is no blank signal. Drove from LA to Las Vegas, only had open frequencies for a few hours of the trip, quality wasn't that great though. Not saying I don't recommend but check your radio frequencies before you buy."
1,Did not work for me,"I have tried this product in 3 different vehicles and with an mp3 player as well as an ipod with no luck. In some areas, it will work temporarily and then cut out to static and I have to change to another station. When I finally get one of the 4 stations to work it will go out again and i have to start over. However, it does seem to work a little better in larger cities (I live in a rural area). But I would not recommend it for long trips as you are constantly having to change the frequency."
3,Ok-Good,This is not a hunk of junk but neither does it go very far it barely covers my trailer and wont go through the alluminium siding at all so if 88.5 and 88.1 are coming in strong in your area you will have no luck with 88.3 (so thats 3 channels you can't use) and 88.7 might get feedover from 88.5 anyway it will work in a car great but if its for your trailer forget it if 88.5 and 88.1 are in use locally.
4,"mad @ first, happy now","At first I thought this thing was a POS: it had TERRIBLE sound quality, but then i realized it sounds like this if you have the volume on your device (phone; ipod; etc) all the way up.. i was pretty dissapointed at first and literally almost threw it in the trash, but once i turned the volume to about 50% (on my ipod) and the volume up in my car, it sounded great! reception over the four channels is good, especially on the highway. Definitely worth the $20, no question about it.. i guarantee that anyone who expereinced bad sound qualiry from it simply has their device turned up too much."
3,OK..,"It didn't fit in my chevrolet cavalier 2004, but i'll find a use for it. It works in my moms ford so though. i would recommend it cause it sounds great in the ford. Just don't buy it if you have a cavalier."
3,Average,"The idea is good. But the writing is bad. If Perry is indeed a writer of children's books he should work a little on his style and choice of words. I do not speak of the dialogs, but I think the colloquialisms and wrong grammar of the descriptive parts are no good, not even in a low quality paperback written to entertain and nothing else. Surprising events and twists in the story make the novel a good read, though. Some of the events do not have a motivation (why would the battleships destroy the earth?) and it is not really explained psychologically why Jay actually joins the MiB. But, nevertheless, a good book for a not too long journey on a plane."
5,This book is so freakin funny,"I laughed so many times reading this book. It is so funny! I also like it a little better than the movie, because there is more stuff."
5,T&T Like My Own Video,"I have purchased two of the videos from T&T and I will admit that it is like one you would see when you go to visit friends, but that's it charm. I can see PBS and the History channel all the time, but to see it like I would see it makes it real to me. I would love to know this couple and I admire their joy of travel. I too love to travel, but do it with tours as I travel alone. I envy their shared love of travel. These are young people that I would like to have as friends. They are adventuresome and see sites not on the regular tour. I thank them for allowing me to relive my own travels and to share theirs with me."
1,Hideously appalling...,"Do these people have no shame?Here's a short synopsis... One amazingly annoying couple go to Egypt on their third year wedding anniversary, and decide to make a slide show to ram down the throats of others, and have the nerve to sell it.In short; the shooting and editing sucks, we don't care about their pedestrian opinions, they look clueless, and there is no story other than their verbal onanism.I so desperately want my money back!"
2,This CD is different,I own all of Gary Taylor's music and this is the only cd he has done that I wish I had kept my money.
3,okay,gary taylor does a good job here but this work is not as good as his earlier music. I's not a square one or mood of midnight. on his early stuff every song is good. this is not the case here. something is lacking here. i really like his music buit this is not his best.
5,Had To Have This on CD,"I own this album on wax & now on CD I can take it to the car. I love Reggae and this album is a must-have,"
4,Get This!,"Back in print! This wasn't available for YEARS, and when it was, it was available as an import only! So happy to hear it again!!!"
4,Debut album from an early Brazilian rocker,"This is a reissue of female rock singer Wanderlea's first album, from 1963. It's original title is ""Wanderlea"" and it features covers of North American pop-rock hits (by the likes of Bobby Darin) and many more Brazilian originals, notably several tunes written by songsmith Rossini Pinto. Wanderlea became one of the regulars on singer Roberto Carlos' ""Jovem Guarda"" TV show, which was a focal point for the 'Sixties ""ie-ie-ie"" sound."
4,Gentleman Boss: The Life of Chester Alan Arthur,Slowly making my way through biographies of all the presidents. This book does a good job of explaining the life of an obscure 19th century president.
4,Beautiful Except for the Annoying Bumblebee,"This is a very relaxing and delightful cd in almost every sense as well-played cello music often is. The selections included on this Naxos collection are almost all slow movements or romantic pieces from fairly well known works (not a surprise given the title). The only exception to this is the extremely annoying (and I'm convinced misplaced) ""Flight of the Bumble-bee"" which is neither relaxing nor enjoyable. Thankfully it's only 72 seconds long, but that's more than long enough to ruin a romantic moment with my darling spouse Bessie."
5,I wanted to learn more about flamenco,"I have recently began teaching myself flamenco guitar and I wanted to become familiar with its history, development and the people involved. This book was really good at answering a lot of questions I had about flamenco. It caused me to purchase a lot of CDs, DVDs, and other books to become even more aquainted with this art form. I don't have any reservations about suggesting this book to anyone seeking to enhance their knowledge of flamenco. It had good quotes from lots of flamencos past and present. My only criticism is that is did not contain any photographs of the people it mentioned. But this is fine because I looked them up online. The writer seems to have a disdain of those flamencos who are making this style into cash-cow. But what true fan wouldn't?Great book."
2,pronzini needs to find better ways to keep reader involved,"bill pronzini's carpenter and quincannon lacks clear focus and thought. While i read the book in hopes of being entertained, the various detective stories pronzini writes about are as elementary and outdated as the very events in time that take place. While he utilizes a clear and consice writing style, one that incorporates a kind of formalistic, European-Anglo type, the content of a suspenseful, thought-provoking narrative definitely lacks. While he writes about various detective stints that his San Francisco detective agency encounters, the stories lack a good climax and fail to keep the reader guessing as professional detective stories often do."
5,A girl's best friend,These boots are great I am already planning to buy another pair. They fit great and are so comfortable. If you have a tiny build and are looking for a cute knee boot that actually fits like it's supposed to then these are a lovely choice.
4,Fun and comfortable,"Super fun shoes. Good shoes that don't kill you feet. Super warm, they are exactly as they look. They arrived in a timely manner and in good condition."
5,THE MAGNIFiCENT MISS DANDRIDGE!,THIS INCREDIBLE WOMAN WAS BLESSED WITH ACTING TALENT TO RIVAL ANY ACTRESS IN FILMS TODAY!...A SPLENDID SINGING VOICE AND BEAUTY BEYOND COMPARE! This CD is what Dorothy was all about! It is just fabulous! No collection should be without this one!
5,For the price; Perfect,"Well, I'm returning for my second pair of these glasses in the last two weeks because someone felt they needed them more than I.They wrap around your forhead just right, so the wind doesn't hit your eyes and no more crying like regular glasses.I highly recommend these glasses for the price. Amazon, you rock."
4,Muy funcional!,"Los ocupo todas las noches que viajo en mi motocicleta, son de buen tamaño y son durables."
2,a bit sad,"the delivery for my item purchased was fast, although it wasn't exactly as shown. the picture for these glasses show a tint, howvever they are completely clear."
4,GOOD BOOK FOR PRACTICE.,The book is good for the starter to start the project.but it lacks in the general application for the projects of the various Industry.Some of the guidelines are being left half the way and needs to get more elaborative.Otherwise book is really good for the beginer in the PM and it definately releives so many doubts and fear for practising PM.
5,Thorough and informative!,"As a project manager, I've seen and purchased many books on the subject of project management and find Mr. Westland's book to be one of the best. It outlines his straightforward methodology (MPMM) and includes countless examples, diagrams, forms and checklists. The CD-rom that's included gives a great overview of the methodology in powerpoint format. I find myself returning to his book countless times during the course of a project and feel confident knowing that all my bases are covered.If you can only buy one book on project management, this is the one!"
4,Good Crayons except purple,"These crayons were very good - except purple.All the other colors were bright and just as expected.The purple looked a lot like a different shade of blue.I ended up buying some separate purple crayons from aleading company website. Other than that, they werevery good. I had a few crayons that were broken uponarrival but I didn't contact the company because therewere still more than enough in tact for a class of 32.Overall am happy with my purchase, though."
4,Cool Folding Headphones,"I find that this headphone is great. While a lot of people go for the earbud type of earphones, I personally don't like that type of design. I am not comfortable with putting anything down into my ears.So this headphone fits the bill very well for me. It is very comfortable to wear, and the 40mm NeoDymium Drivers provide a lot of bass. What is really neat about these earphone is that they can be folded up, so they don't take up a lot of space when I am not using them. I also like the ""L"" design of the stereo 3.5mm plug.So, if you are like me and don't like earbuds, you will really appreciate this unit. I have had this for over a year with out any breakage."
5,Must Have Collection!,This Romance Collection is Amazing! All 8 of these mini series are Must See Classics! Totally worth the money!
1,Very disappointed in the quality,"I am familiar with most of the stories and given that my husband enjoys watching these with me I figured it would be a great Christmas gift to each other. I was really disappointed because while Emma, Jane Eyre, and Lorna Doone were fine, Pride and Prejudice and Tom Jones are skipping often and sometimes we can't get through the scene - we have to stop and go to another scene, or my husband just gets really frustrated and doesn't want to watch the end of the movie.This happened with Little House Season 1 (he bought that for me) as well - I noticed the reviews there mentioned similar quality issues."
2,Improper material for viewing,"The inclusion of Tom Jones in this collection leaves a bad taste for the whole product. The inclusion of nudity and immorality was unnecessary. I am sure that the screenwriter and director chose these portrayials but it ruined the crediability of the set. I put the Tom Jones DVD in the trash as I do not want that type of material in my home.The Jane Austin films are good, the other films were interesting but due to the above I would not have purchased the set had I known."
4,Mostly great romance and value but...,"Hard to beat the number of flics for the price. Really enjoyed most of them and will view them over and over for years, I am sure, but found Tom Jones too raunchy and sex-obsessed for our tastes and have retired it to our frisbee collection."
4,A CLASSic Collection,There is no doubt that the BBC produces the finest dramatic interpretations of classic English literature. This particular collection enchants from beginning to end.
3,The Romance Collection,"The service was fantastic and the quality of the DVDs are excellent. However, I didn't like all of the movies. I have watched all of them and will give this collection to someone who might appreciate it more."
1,really bad,Do not waste your time or money on this poorly written book. You will spend a lot of time trying to figure what you are supposed to do because the examples in the book do not match up with what is on your screen. I do not understand how this book was ever published the way it is because if somebody like an editor actually went through this they would see that it does not work.
2,Dreamweaver MX Complete Course,"Dreamweaver MX Complete Course started out nicely. You'll find clear instructions and the four-color displays of the Dreamweaver interface are good. Then as one reviewer mentioned the good turned bad. Session (chapter) 10 was gobbledygook. Many of the files didn't match the instructions and I found myself improvising frequently to make sense of it. I stumbled into similar problems again in Session 15.In addition to file problems, the author uses terms inconsistently throughout and her instructions are often a riddle. I don't think this book received a hard edit.Parts of the book were wonderful, but the problems I mentioned were frustrating and support is useless. I would not recommend this book."
1,Total Confusion,"I am stunned by the number of high ratings for this book. If you knew next to nothing about Dreamweaver, you would never to able to understand how to use it. When you are given directions without rationales and then something crashes, you are stuck and have to try to figure it out for yourself. This book is a waste of money and your time."
4,Great book,"I have been looking for a book that would show me how to work with Dreamweaver for a while now but was always disappointed when looking thru them.This one however provides step by step instructions on how things are completed. Its a great book but with some flaws...There are errors such as that on page 106 where they talk about linking the training and the designing .htm file. It is reversed. Other annoying things I found was the terms they use are at times inconsistances such as the ""restore down button"" ... normally, people call this the minimize and maximize button. Some guides are not as clear or that I have problems understanding/following. An example is on page 112 step 17.Besides those flaws, this is a great book for beginners and even for those who have worked with Dreamweaver before."
3,not Mac-friendly!!!,"I bought this to help students learn Dreamweaver MX. We use Macs in the lab, and this book shows Windows pictures and terminology only. There are several places in the Dreamweaver program which are worded differently, but there are no notes referring to this, or pictures to show the difference. It would have been relatively simple to show both. I was extremely disappointed , and I am considering pitching it and getting another instead."
1,Still have not recived hat,It's been almost a month and I still haven't recived this hat I mean honestly is it that hard to put it in a box and send it off!
3,Their first album. Not bad. I'd get 5 others of theirs first.,"Yeah, this is my 7th of 10th favorite albums of SUPERCHUNK. To me they really didn't find their swingin', guitar dominating, sometimes emotional song writing thang till the 5 albums that came out after this one. The one song here that's as great as their later material in the 90's is Slack Motherf. I don't listen to this one that often cuz it doesn't have the musical goods I find in: incidental music, foolish, no pocky for kitty, on the mouth and indoor living. chrisbct@hotmail.com"
1,Good Movie Bad Transfer,"This movie was an obvious ripoff of ""Star Wars"" but it's still entertaining. The quality of my DVD, however, has much to be desired. A third of the way through the movie, the picture starts skipping frames. This inferiority makes it almost impossible to watch. Avoid this product."
2,"Nice set, if you're a collector","I bought this item for my daughter this Christmas, along with the other 2 sets, and she was thrilled. We really enjoyed the movie, but the characters are definately for DISPLAY ONLY. I did get them to stand up well, using the stands they came with, but when my daughter tried to play with them (she always pcks them up by the head- that might have something to do with it) the heads broke. We did get them returned, but I think she will be getting something else from the Corpse Bride movie, instead of another set. However, if you plan to use them as display, they are very detailed, and not poseable- aside from the few arms that move."
3,"not really new, slightly damaged","I assume these frames are from a store that took these off the shelf because they had some damage.Mine arrived dirty, with a couple small scratches, and a small crack. But I assume a pristine version of the frame would be more expensive so I didn't return it."
4,Interesting,"Nothing new in the video for anyone who has studied the events, but it is enjoyable to view the hunt for Booth."
5,"Dated, but Still Good","A lot has happened in the aviation world since this book was published in 1990. McDonnell Douglas which was formed with a merger of McDonnell and Douglas companies in 1967 was itself bought out by rival Boeing.This is a book for serious aviation buffs. Facts, data, statistics abound about every plane, helicopter or airliner built by MD from 1920-1990. The DC-3, Phantom II, Skyhawk and Harrier are just a few. Of course, there is a short history of the founding of each company and the key designers & engineers. Clear B&W; photos (although small) and line drawings help the reader see each plane.It's a shame the aircraft industry has shrunk so much. Only two companies remain - Boeing & Lockheed. This book captures a day when there were many more brilliant designs, rapid growth in aviation technology, quicker design to development times. Very good reference book for anything ever made by McDonnell or Douglas. Still a great addition to your library."
5,God Always Keeps His Promises,This is a wonderful book that reminds us of God's faithfulness. Easy to read and one you will want to re-read.
5,"Seems like it'd work, but....","...Thank Goodness, I haven't had a chance to use this here at the lake.I hope never to use it!It hangs on a tree JUST IN CASE.It's heavy. I assume I'd not throw it, but use it in front of me as I swam to extend it tothe person to be rescued.This life ring appears to be durable and well made and provides a sense of securityto our lake front.It arrived in a VERY large box."
1,Again another sellout bad dvd,Well here we are again watching a dvd wich should be a great sounding one as well as looking but the picture looks like crap and the sound not in dolby digital like it should be the menu is but the show isnt i am still woundering why they did that i just dont get it why so many dvds these days are being put out with nothing good on it thats what we are all looking for are we not???its the sound thats what its about
3,Poor production,"I saw Queensryche during this concert tour and they actually blew away Dream Theater as far as stage presence. But here, it's done in black and white and it's just okay. At times, it actaully sounds like Geoff isn't quite hitting the notes. Not that this DVD is overally bad, but it lacks what the Dream Theater (Live in Budokan) DVD has. Also, you can tell that they've pieced together songs from several of their concerts instead of just giving you one concert performance. If you're a Queensryche fan, then this would have to be a must have and you will enjoy it, but hopefully they'll do better next time. Hopefully they will put out a DVD of their Operation Mindcrime's I & II performance's. Wait and see."
3,"Great Performance, Bad Quality Control","First of all, what the hell is ""Strereo""? Look on the back of your dvd cover and tell me...I'm a huge Ryche fan from 1983 and am disappointed with this release. I don't mind the black-and-white, looks artsy to me and makes it unique. The sound is great, however the missing 5.1 sound ruined the experience for me since I have a kick ass system.I don't see why they had to have THREE different versions of ""Losing Myself"" in the extras. The extras were way too short and not worth even bothering watching.I'm actually going to meet the band at a signing tomorrow in New Jersey. If I get more than three seconds to talk to them I'll let them know how disappointed I am with the quality of this dvd.All that being said, Queensryche could put out a DVD of them rehearsing in their sleep and I'd buy it!"
2,"COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH, MUCH BETTER.","It's amazing. Queensryche is such a great band, and perhaps because of the limited budget this DVD kinda sucks. Tate's vocals are way too processed, it seems they turned on the 70's 'Dolby noise reduction' button and every single word he sings sounds squashed (too much compression maybe) and without dinamics. The drums sound amazing thouugh and I believe Rockenfield's Paiste Cymbals raise the bar even more with that wonderful crisp ride cymbal sound. The Guitars sound good too and bass is ok.The show itself (in black and white - lame!) is good, I enjoyed it, but if only production would have been more careful this DVD would be a hit. Come on guys, enough with the slow-mo cameras and the matte finish! This is 2004. Oh well, I will probably sellthis DVD on eBay in a couple of weeks. The Dream Theater appearence at the end is awesome though."
2,Disgusting waste of money!,"The back of the box shows color screen shots, but this DVD is black and white. Are you friggin' kidding me?? After the beautiful Live Evolution they put out this CRAP? There is no 5.1 audio (the back of the box says there is but there isn't). Can you say FALSE ADVERTISING???The song selection is also very poor, could have had at least 3-4 more tracks that were performed on that tour. The only reason I gave this piece of garbage 2 stars instead of 1 is because I am a huge Queensrche fan. Don't believe me? Check out my other reviews of their stuff.Bottom Line: If you liked and enjoyed Live Evolution, do yourself a favor and do NOT waste your money on this nonsense.A MAJOR LETDOWN from Queensrche."
3,walking the hair path,Recovering from economic recession is just like walking in a hair path. Not everyone has absolutely the same capability. But no one save until he makes it. So read the book and one may try to win or to loose. This is the price on should pay.
5,Now I am the Champion of the Ninja!,"I'll be wearing this fine headband whenever I watch movies with ninjas in them, movies without ninjas in them, or whenever I feel like being a ninja (all of the time)."
4,Worthwhile addition to your investment library,"Fine book, it is full of common sense and worth reading. Author covers a variety of topics, from different investment periods of high inflation to stock market bubbles, large cap equities to hedge funds, asset allocation to market timing, active management to passive management...Book highlights include:1. Looking beyond mainstream investment opportunities. Benefits awarded to those that travel in illiquid and inefficient segments of the market.2. Portfolio rebalancing, correlation matrix assumptions, optimizers.3. Contrarian Investing.4. Manager performance assessment and biases in index data.5. Benefits of US Treasuries in a portfolio.6. Multiple examples of BAD Investment ideas. Panic of 1998. Outlier events.Neil R. Chelo, CFA"
2,A lot of nothing,This book has very little to teach you and it's virtually unreadable. Make sure you read one or two pages before you buy in case you are like me and you can't stand his style.
5,Good book,"This book is about a boy named Ben Uchida, who has to move to an internment camp along with his family, because he's Japanese American. This book is a good book that teaches a lot about history."
3,Journal Of Ben Uchida,"The book The Journal of Ben Uchida by Barry Denenberg is about a boy named Ben Uchida who lives in San Francisco, California in the year 1942. Ben Uchida was a normal kid 13 year-old until the bombing of Pearl Harbor and everything changed, everyone around him started treating him different because he was Japanese. This is the story of Ben and his family having to go to a concentration camp and finding out about everything that is going to happen during his stay and everything that is wrong about.I recommend to young adults because it tells you what it was like to be that age back when people were being treated unfairly and it is in the point of view of a young adult."
3,good,"i thought it was good, but i kept on puting it down because i could not keep on reading it for more then 10 min. at a time. (it's to boring). But i found something odd, it's the journal of Ben Uchida but in the pictures in the back on page 151 they have a picture of three boys, and if look at the middle boy you will see that he is in the exact same clothes, position and has the same face as the boy on the cover(they are the same). Which would be fine except for the fact that they call him....Bruce Sansui. So i wonder how researched this book is......"
4,The Journal of Ben Uchida,"I recommend this book for children 10 and older because it shows fighting in the United States that might make younger children scared. "" This book has a little violence too, because people die and they lose a lot of friends and family. The book is interesting because it shows how friendship is made and how friends help out other friends even in tough times. One example is when Kenny comes along and steals the ball from Ben. Mike gets very mad and punches Kenny. He says, ""Don't take anything from Ben. For example, when they were going to sleep one of Ben's friends died of hunger. Ben was very sad, so he decided to write to his father. He wrote, "" He missed him and that he wanted to go home."" This book is fiction. It really happened. In conclusion, if you are interested in war, fighting, and sadness, then I recommend this book."
4,The journal thats outstanding!,"It makes you feel like you're Ben when you read the book it's scary, sad ,and great."
2,Ben Uchida Journal,This was boring to be honest . It didnt seem interesting and it left me confused about a lot of things.
3,pretty disappointing,"This should have been an excellent book, because the subject is so important, but it wasn't. The main character seems like a nice boy but his sarcasm, which is constant, makes him sound too much like Holden Caulfied (""...if you want to know the truth,"" p.71). The other characters are grossly underdeveloped. We have no idea what happened to Ben's father, even after he is reunited with his family. Not only is the ending abrupt, but the epilogue is completely unsatisfying; why didn't Ben ever marry? Did internment ""ruin"" him? Also,the photographs are fascinating, but they all refer to Manzanar or Topaz. Was there even a real Mirror Lake camp? I'm not clear on it. The author should have explained that in his notes. A different author would have done a much better job."
2,Don't waste your money!,"During my 37 years of driving I have probably owned a dozen repair manuals, most of which rated 3 to 4 stars. This Chilton's manual barely makes a 2. It covers too many years and models to cover more than the most rudimentary maintenance in any depth; there are too few illustrations; and it does not contain one exploded view of my 3.2L Trooper engine. There are parts on this engine that cannot be even found in this manual! Let's hope Haynes publishes one soon."
2,Leaves the Reader with Questions,"Good documentaion in a manual should not be written as though the reader has prior knowledge or hands on experience with the item being described. Haynes does a much better job of photo illustrations along with detailed instructions that are so precise that you accomplish a task with no prior expereience. Chilton's Maual leaves the reader asking ""what is that"".Definitely not user friendly!"
2,Not for beginners...,...this is ok for a general overview but not worth getting for any in depth work...
4,"Overall, a pretty nice book","I happily settled in my recliner to take an ""arm-chair trip"" to Savannah when this book arrived. Savannah is one of those historic cities I've always wanted to visit, so in the meantime I'll do it by book. This book is not a disappointment - there is tons of information on the history of the city, and nice photographs of the old homes and buildings. Also, the author included photos of some of the grand old homes which were torn down...sadly. It kind of made me want to slow down the pace of life after looking at it - and I found myself somewhat drawn to go there even more just to experience it in person. Nice book - great information, and great photos to go along with the info."
5,You kids have alot to learn,"Cmon now really Dropkick Murphys, The Business, that is total opposite of what these guys are. Maybe if you were in your mid twenties now you would understand better kids. Stop buying sucky music with your parents credit card"
4,solid on the ends,"the title track proclaims the band's self induced picture of themselves ""looking like animals"" and they want a mix tape with a little Husker Du. Me? I sit and smile while my head wiggles from side to side, the fog suddenly disspates and Davey's lisp reverberates around my flat with glee...A portion of this EP was recorded during the ""Very Emergency"" sessions and it shows...happiness is still the rage and it seems like the crew has found something that feels good....however, why they are touring with Bad Religion is beyond me. the underage, drunken boat that sailed in for the Warfield show taunted the band and proceeded to throw beers at them while constructing a pit of testosterone that probably would have gone on even if Burt Bacharach would've intervened."
2,this band isn't that good,this band kinda [stinks] because of the guitar.He always plays the same note but the singer is awesome.They should make their songs better and then i would like them more.Well anyways.If u just like a single riffed peice of music get this cd i guess.Later
1,garbage pure and simple,"This is weak and cheesy music. The whole EMO genre is complete BS. If you want punk riffs listen to The Business and The Dropkick Murphy's, two bands that blow the Promise Ring out of the water."
4,If you have Java in 21 Days on need this book,More java in 21 days will start from where java in 21 days droped off. This is fill with useful information and I think everyone should read it.
5,Perfect,"All completely as advertised. Works great. 100% percent transparent. I am very pleased with this purchase, thank you very much!"
2,Mixed Reception,"This book has its ups and downs.Like another reviewer mentioned, this book is very verbose and unnecessarily full of pictures that are not helpful.Concepts are often very poorly worded. Just because I'm an EE undergrad doesn't mean I like to decipher sentences that appear to be paragraphs at first glance. After 4 commas, two dashes, and a colon, I no longer have any interest in net-torque on a cylinder. A subtitle of ""for scientists and engineers"" is not an excuse to write in indecipherable technical terms.There are easier ways to explain things.Ultimately, I think this book fails for the same reason most physics books and professors fail: it is written by and for people with a natural gift for physics. For the other 98% of the world, it might as well be greek.While a thorough reference and good guide for physically-inclined folk, this is a very difficult book for first year undergrads to use.I would opt for a different textbook if I had the chance."
4,Why has this man been relegated to the scrap heap of history,"Dan McCaffery has done a great service to the memory of Tommy Burns and his place in boxing. Villified in his time for fighting outside his nationality and for being the first World Champion to fight outside his race , and lose. Dan McCaffery tells an engaging story of a young man who was small ( 170lbs 5'7"") and who became as a Canadian, the World Boxing Champion.An engaging story takes him through his fights and victories to his loss at the hands of Jack Johnson in Australia. That is when Tommy Burns really lost the fight of his life, as he was torn apart by the media of the day, and remains to this day listed as the worst Champion ever. Luckily Mr. McCaffery in this story disproves that and brings us a truly amazing mans life."
2,Waste of Time and Money,"This book was written by someone who has spent a short amount of time in the business and probably did a fair but not large amount of sales. I am surprised she says she is a sales manager. In her mathematical example (20% of purchase price), she couldn't even get the answer correct. Having been in the business for 20 years, I found it very weak with substance and it appears to have been written by someone who thinks she is a trainer but isn't. Sorry. It was a waste of my money."
4,Great drive,"Especially for the money. Easy to install, great software bundle to boot. I simply love the drive. Now, a little skinny on the media. As of now (3-23-05) the dual layer DVD's are about 3-4 bucks a piece. They are convenient, but as of right now, you pay for that. The light scribe technology is also not free. Light scribe cd-r's, which you must use to get the light scribe to write a label, adds about .40 cents per cd-r. Does not sound like a lot, but buy a 100 cd-r's and this adds up!!! The technology is cool, it takes about 20 minutes and you have a really cool (greyscale) label imprinted on the cd. No labels, using sharpies etc. The speed of the drive is fantastic. 16X for a DVD is really flying as of now. You can't beat this drive, just don't get too excited about the technology it uses at this time, you pay for convenience. All that being said, the short falls of the drive are not the actual drive's fault, it will just take some time for the media to drop in price, and it will."
4,A speedy slow-poke,"I purchased the drive because I was interested in the Lightscribe labeling capabilities but I found a more significant and useful feature was the much faster read times compared to the DVD-ROM drive that it replaced.As for the Lightscribe features, printing is slow, the media is expensive and the label has low contrast text and graphics.The lowest contrast (least legible) print setting for a simple two-line text label takes about 5 minutes to print. A high contrast (most legible) text and graphic label can take up to 30 minutes to print.Based on various prices and brands, the Lightscribe feature adds about $0.50 per disk to the cost of media, both CD-R and DVD+R (there are no DVD-R's yet available).The printable side of a Lightscribe disc is a dull bronze color. The text and graphics produced are darker shades of bronze depending on the print quality level selected. It never reaches a true black.This labeling technology is still in its very early stages but has great promise."
5,Great for transporting heavy equipment,This transporter works great because its low to the ground folds up easy and allows me to transport heavy computer servers and equipment.
2,Very Disappointed,"Even though I have always loved the books published by Sybex, I must confer that I am very disappointed with the lack of useful material contained in this book. There was no in-depth coverage on any of the critical exam topics and after reading the book I can assure you that you will not pass the exam based on this book alone.I had to purchase books published by another vendor prior to taking the 70-219 exam to fill in all of the holes left by this book. I am happy that I passed the exam, but upset that I had to read more books than necessary to do it.Thanks, but no thanks Sybex!"
1,Not so good,This book is not that great. There are many technical errors and places where items were not cleaned up when there was an opportunity to do so.
4,Recccomended,"I've always like this series. This book, in addition to some hands on with the 2000 directory and DNS should be enough for you to pass."
4,Chamber music for the indie-rock set,"With cello, contrabass and drums, Bonfire Madigan appears to be a group of indie-rockers who never could shake the classical music training of their youth."
3,My son just loves it,"This is not an exciting toy in my view, but my son just loves it. He has this toy since he was one, and he is still playing it now (he is 4), mainly during the bath time. It is more durable than I expected mainly due to it is simple."
3,does this work?,i dont kno if i should get this because i have a sk8 wheel and its got rubber burns or skid warks or wateva they called and i wanna kno if theyll come off in it
3,"Classic, But Not What I had Expected","This is more of a entertainment read, a starting point, or an introduction. It doesn't include very detailed information on specific topics and lacks any pictures or color which would be great."
3,its ok,the book had a lot of useful growing tips but without pictures can tend to be a bit useless if you have no prior knowledge on the plants. it is pretty helpful if you also have other books that you can reference to
4,Learn all about it.,"This book covers many different subjects with details on growing and harvesting plants. Not all plants are easy to grow, nor will all grow in your zone, but it is a good review of what is possible if you want to peruse the possibilities."
1,Not worth having,"This is one book I only flipped through and realized that it's a completely useless book. It's like someone wanted to write a book that would bring in some money, but would not like to put more then a week into researching it. It's a book with 1,2 pages of useless information per plant that would one find on Google with 'I feel lucky' button. The infos are non-specific and unpractical. It gives no knowledge regarding the plants.It's disappointing form beginning to the end."
1,"Woah, Don't even waste your money.","This book lacks almost everything you would want and need to know about cultivating and harvesting psychoactive plants. No instructions really on obtaining seeds or equipment needed. In all honesty, a quick google search on the topic will sum up this whole book plus more."
5,Just what I was looking for...,I bought this sleeping bag for my girlfriend's daughter and she loves it. The weight is prefect for sleep-overs and camping trips. It looks good and seems very durable.
5,awesome book,"this book is so awesome, use it everyday and i great condition for a used book. lots of space to write down your thoughts"
2,Over rated Book,Bought this book because of the good reviews. Turned out that it was over-hyped. Don't really find the arrangements nice to play. Maybe 2 -3 songs are nicely done but the rest are a disappointment.
3,These ar DUETS!,"Yes, great collection, but somewhat false advertising as this is a book of duets. Otherwise 5 stars."
3,It's just an ink cartridge,"We have a Cannon copier in our office that requires this cartridge. It's an older one, 10+ years, so finding someone to service it was no easy task. All the service people we contacted were only interested in selling us a new copier. We finally got someone to come out. The issue we were having is, whenever we made a copy, we had to set it darker for the lettering to show up well, then we were getting dark streaks across part of the page. The guy that came out did nothing more than tell us we needed a new cartridge and gave us a bill for the call. He never even opened it up to take a look. We thought maybe it needed cleaning. Anyway, we bought this cartridge and we still have the same problem with the copies. But we should get another 10,000 pages now."
1,Review of Sai Earrings,"The earrings were much cheaper than they appear and broken when I received them. The folks in customer service were helpful and very responsive. It was easy to return them, but I was disappointed in their quality."
5,Just Perfect!,"This is the best tent I've owned! It is a perfect size for two and all of the stuff you need--it advertises that it sleeps three but I don't see that happening unless it is 3 kids. We are 5'8"" and 5'10"" and had more than enough room for our hiking packs at our feet and other stuff at our heads. It is very lightweight and so quick and easy to put together! Our first trip using it was on the coast of Northern California. We used the rainfly over the top and it kept out most of the condensation/fog though the sides were a bit wet on the inside in the mornings. It kept us very warm and was so easy to travel with! My favorite part is the screened in skylight to watch the stars and feel that much closer to nature while keeping the bugs away."
1,Three Season does not mean much,"I bought this tent thinking that three season meant better quality. When I received it found out that it does not mean that at all. The poles were the cheapest quaility I had ever seen in a tent and the material was not much better. I have a cheap regular tent that I bought several years ago that is heavier but much better quality. I was hoping that this was a good deal but I guess it is like they say ""you get what you pay for"""
5,The Systems Revolution and Walter Wink,"I believe that if anyone can prepare the ""modern"" church for its critical next step into the future, it is Walter Wink. His development of the critical use of scientific theory mostly drawn from the ""new"" physics and the ""new"" biology, are extremely helpful in providing a guidepost into the integration of theology and science, using a philosophy of science integration.The is one point that wish to state clearly. This series of texts is not about ""your father's (or mother's) Jesus!"" Wink demonstrates a Jesus that is dealing with issues of power and domination. It seems that little ""theological reflection about the nature of the church"" is present within the current psychological disposition of the American church. Wink provides a necessary corrective to this religious culture of psycho-babble.It will be a difficult read. Keep a Bible handy."
1,Dissatisfied,"I bought this DVD because Pee Wee Kirkland was advertisedon it, but it was not what I thought, wish I can get my moneyback!"
1,Gets old fast,"The cutesy ""serving up fresh phrases"" banter that fills this tape would get truly annoying where one to listen to more than once. Much better choices are available."
1,Don't waste your time on this one.,"As one who did not know any German, I tried this two tape edition. I had a great deal of trouble following and repeating the words and phrases and was very frustrated. It wasn't until I tried the Pimsleur Travel Edition that I realized how bad the Drive-In German tapes were."
5,Excellent Book For Parents of Pre-Teens,"I purchased this book looking for ways to talk to my boys (we have 10-year-old twins) about drinking, drugs, and smoking. What I didn't know is that there is an entire section on inhalants, (sometimes known as huffing). This is something that I know nothing about because this wasn't an issue when I was growing up. Children are most vulnerable to inhalants between the ages of 9 and 12, and because regular household items are used, it is not something that they have to got out and buy, and it they are not illegal.This book is an excellent resource for parents. Book includes pictures and is VERY informative. It also tells you what to look for if you suspect your child is using.This book should be mandatory reading for all parents!"
4,not bad...,"This is a decent enough album--I can't say it exactly blows my mind, but given that it was more or less thrown together in a week, it's not too bad. Graham doesn't have a great voice (there's a reason Damon does most of Blur's singing...), and some of the lyrics are sorta simplistic, but all in all I was pleasantly surprised. And besides, it's a federal law that all Blur fans must own it."
4,Damon who?,"Great solo record from the workhorse behind blur. I dare someone else to try to play his lead guitar parts while singing dead-on harmony. He's more than ""the guitarist"" now, he's the Author."
1,Not Usefull,The design will not let the bit reach the project without it being pulled to far out of the collett.
3,Accurate measurements?,"While it does cut circles nicely, it is not good for cutting smaller circles (25 - 50mm) as there is no way to accurately measure them."
2,As with most dremel products...,"it is cheap, flexible, and inaccurate. If using it to guide a cut in soft aluminum, the bit tends to ride to the outside of the circle, adding nearly 5 mm to the circle's diameter. Wherever you stop to adjust while turning the circle, the tool leaves a chunk of material protruding into the circle. For it to be accurate in cutting circles, the plastic section that attaches to the tool would need to be much more rigid."
4,drywall holes are easy,"Makes cutting drywall holes sooooo easy.just the sizing is a little confusing and I would have to do a test on a piece of paper first to see if the size was right. (just dab a little marker or paint on the bit and do a circle without the device on, on a piece of paper then overlay the paper to see if the size matches up.I recommend it, makes a nice addition to dremel"
3,Works well for occasional use.,"I believe this tool is primarily intended to cut holes in sheet-rock ceilings to mount concealed lighting fixtures. If you already have a Dremel Rotary tool and a couple of light fixtures to install it's worth it. Obviously, if your contractor can do these all day long, A Roto zip or similar tool with proper attachment would be far more useful. It's nice for carving occasional circles or straight lines in wood or plastic projects."
3,it is just okay,"it does cut Ok, but if you try to cut a deep cut (about 1/4 inch of more) the cut groove gets clogged with the cutting dust and either heats up or jump out of the cutting pattern"
2,Be careful,"I stripped the threading on mine after using it twice. I wasn't aware that the plastic was THAT cheap...If you buy this for the price be sure to tighten your Dremel unit all the way, but not too tight or you'll quickly wear out the threads. Also, hold the Dremel very firmly at the base along with the Dremel mount. Any amount of odd wobble can strip the threading.All in all, I got one good circle cut and I [i]might[/i] be able to repair it. If I was to do it all over again, though, I'd probably just try to build myself something similar. It's really not that complicated."
4,Not Bad,"Unlike the router table, the housing it screws into is better.I've used it to do over sized radii by making an attachment for it.A sharp cutting tool improves the quality of work. I also triedusing a 1/8 inch end mill. Not sure if it worked better than theDremel cutter, still, after getting used to it, thought it workedpretty well. Feed rate is important."
4,Made nice circles,Shipped quickly and did the job.I would have liked the measurement guide to be more easy to use but a tape measure from bit to center filled in perfectly. Only dawback was on the white ceiling some plastic edges would have prevented the marring.
5,A collection of examples and wonderful insight,"This book has a unique way (as far as design books go) of illustrating concepts. Instead of the usual and typically boring style of writing out information and then giving the reader a few tutorials and examples to illustrate, this book works only with examples. And the examples aren't just any examples, there is an entire collection of beautiful examples written and explained by top designers and artist of our time. I've always been one to learn best by a visual example and if you feel that way too, then this book will kick off your study of digital design in a fresh unique way that is unparalleled in today's publishing world."
4,Digital Arts,"This book shows you the tools different graphic artists used to complete specific works they have done. It shows you key elements they used, but it does not say how they created their entire piece. It is kind of basic stuff, but it is a good reference book to learn or review some techniques. The programs most often discussed are photoshop and painter. This is a good book for graphic design students."
1,Awful,"Jeremy Sutton as good as he is at this,should have picked some better examples to put in this book.There are a couple of artist in there,you could call digital artist,the rest should not even be in here.I'm glad I bought a used one,so I'm not out the money what the new ones go for."
4,Just Like The Picture,"This looks just like the picture. It's very cute. Just remember to buy two, this ring does not come as a set!!"
5,Provocative and Paradigm Changing!,"I found the comparison of rank and peer assumptions, logic, and practices to be quite eye-opening. The examples and illustrations the author gives are very helpful. The writing style was very readable and engaging. I would highly recommend this book."
4,More fun with Spider Jerusalem.,"Warren Ellis, Transmetropolitan: Year of the [censored for Amazon consumption] (Vertigo, 1999)As a non-review note, it's really kind of ludicrous--the kind of thing Spider Jerusalem would be amused by, no doubt--that this review got redlined for me putting the title of the book in the header. Do something about the sillier aspects of your filters, Amazon, plzkthx.In its third volume, Transmetropolitan managed to do something I didn't think it could: get even funnier. Feeling the old ennui creeping back in, Spider pumps himself full of everything known to man (and some things that aren't). His editor snags him a new assistant, but with a catch: she's his niece, which will (hopefully) stop Spider from doing the same things that have caused him to lose his other assistants over the years. Fat chance. How, Ellis asks us, to find meaning in a meaningless world? I'm not entirely sure he'll ever come up with an answer, but it's certainly fun to watch him try. ****"
2,Tiresome,"You know, one can get enough of a venom-spitting, bitter cranky tattoo man. Satire is great, but maybe Doonersbury and Walt Kelly could be as scathing without being so acrid, vulgar and unpleasant,All celebrate Warren Ellis for TRANSMETROPOLITAN,but, let me tell you, I don't think I will suffer this constant bile for ten issues! Oh, and one more thing: CALVIN of Calvin and Hobbes, from where Warren Ellis has obviously derived the idea of monster snowmen, had more imagination in his horrid snow creations.Give me FREAKANGELS any time!"
2,Very very average,"Same old formula...strangers on a train mix posessions (though mobile phones in this case, not briefcases,or files, or whatever), meet each other again, fall in love, get married, live happily ever after. The only thing keeping them apart from the start of the book till the end is the heroine's unwillingness to get involved with a man again after her late husband left her life in a mess, complete with two kids. The main characters, Matthew and Georgia, acknowledge their attraction, but only trust is in the way, therefore dragging the story somewhat. The characters don't shine, conversation doesn't sparkle, and in all it just turns out to be any ole' book."
2,Cropped,"I hate it when the companies who produce DVD sets of old TV broadcasts insist on cropping the picture in order to give the image a widescreen appearance. The top and bottom of the picture, as originally broadcast, are missing (I still have an episode on VHS from an early 1980s PBS broadcast to compare). As I watched this set, I kept wanting to hit the zoom-out key. It's a nice show. They should've done it right."
3,All You Need Is A Remote.,"I found this set overrated at best. Although there is some interesting footage, much of it is woefully dated and, frankly, dull. Have your remote handy to move through the segments where the director spends wwaaayyyy too much time. You'll know 'em when you see 'em. I will be hard-pressed to watch most of this set a second time."
1,Sony - Not at Home,"I purchased a SONY VAIO Desktop, and am very disappointed. The monitor must be adjusted (rotated, pin balance, key balance, horizontal, vertical) and I cannot get it to my liking. It also flickers. It may be a defective computer.Unfortunately, SONY's warranty does not include in-home service. In order to have someone look at the monitor and computer, I will have to pay (...)an authorized dealer to come to my home.I have not received a response to E-Mail I sent SONY. The technician was not upset when I asked if anything could be done before I told everyone how unhappy I was.Maybe there is still hope. But were I to purchase another computer, I would get one with in-home service. This aggravation and disappointment is not worth it."
3,How much?,"I played with this slick looking machine at the local outlet of a national electronics chain and I must say I was taken by the cool, futuristic design. However, looking over its specs, it is really a fairly run-of-the-mill P4 with just a built in TV recorder (not a tuner, just a VCR-like feature that uses your TV's tuner) and a DVD-R to brag about. On the short end, it is hardly expandable at all and the price is positively gargantuan considering today's going rate for even a top of the line Dell."
2,Where is the Rambus memory ?,"A machine geared for broadband and graphic capabilities like this should definitely be configured with top of the line memory-Rambus RDRAM or at least DDR, not old technology SDRAM. This will cause a bottleneck in performance and the decision to use SDRAM is very disappointing."
1,this computer has been a NIGHTMARE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I started in the computer industry (b4 PC's) in 1969. This is without a doubt the worst computer I have ever owned. The TV portion works OK. You cannot add any non Sony components (such as another hard drive), as they are incompatable and cause strange operating system problems. The mini-disc player/recorder can only be used as an eraser. Put in a disc full of tunes and attempt any kind of edit and you get a BLANK DISC.It is a home networking joke. I have 4 or 5 machines connected to my home network at any one time. Never a network problem with any of them. The Sony is always trouble. Refuses to recognize or be recognized by other machine on the network. Sony's support staff is inept.I have 2 Sony computers, 2 Sony TV's, 3 Sony stereo systems, 4 Sony mini disc machines, 4 Sony cell phones. To say the least I WAS Sony devotee.I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SONY PRODUCT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Good belt for LIGHT duty,"I actually just replaced this belt with something more substantial. I bought this exact same belt a few years ago along with an AWP tool pouch. This belt worked well during electrician school, but as soon as you start loading it up with more/heavier tools it becomes uncomfortable. This is a thin nylon web belt. Loading it up causes it to curl and dig into your hips.If you are doing very light duty and/or not doing construction work alot this works just fine. If you are a normal person planning a full room remodel or a full time construction worker then I suggest looking at something better (like a reinforced padded belt).I just picked up a padded leather/nylon AWP belt at my local big box home improvement store this morning and it it leaps and bounds better.Spend twice as much on a better belt. It will last longer and be alot more comfortable to wear."
3,Mathematical problem solving,"I would have loved the book. My son is a high school math teacher and would love to have had the book. The package was ripped open and the book removed before we received it. All we got was an empty envelope. We received a refund from the seller, which we very much appreciated. Amazon was also understanding and quick to make sure that we were compensated. The book is very expensive (even used), and the one I ordered was the only reasonably priced. We were not able to re-order the book."
2,Difficult book to read and understand,"Although this book is but 15 chapters and 336 pages long it took me an incredible amount of time to read through it due to the complexity with which it was written. I've read several Cisco Press books in the same time it took to read this one! Further, I found myself asking the question over and over again, ""If this book is about the fundamentals of Voice over IP and is 'A Systematic Approach to Understanding the Basics of Voice over IP', why is it difficult to grasp even the 'basics' as presented by the authors?"" As stated in a previous review, the authors have a great understanding of the topics, however, like my Theory of Operating Systems instructor, they do not do well in 'dumbing' down that information to me, a layperson in this field. This book was definitely written by VoIP engineers for VoIP engineers, not for beginners like myself."
2,"Cover many topics, but need lots of improvements.","This book covers many topics, which is nice, but it needs much improvements and careful revisions:1) It has many typos and errors in the books; You can easily find several dozens of them.2) For the SIP and SS7, seems that the author know little about these topics, so they just get the contents from the ITU recommendations and RFC. they are not explained clearly.3) The writing is kind of dry."
1,If your are looking for fundamentals check out Voice over IP First-Step instead.,"I was looking for a book on the fundamentals of VoIP. I had high expectations for this book because I am a big fan of Cisco Press. I felt after reading this book that it was full of GREAT content but fell short of delivering it in a decipherable manner. It was loaded with information, too much information and seemed to be stuck in a transition phase of VoIP. I went ahead and wrote Cisco Press about my displeasure. They recommended I check out Voice over IP First-Step (Paperback) http://www.amazon.com/Voice-over-First-Step-Kevin-Wallace/dp/1587201569/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1269372437&sr=8-3 and sent me a copy to review for free. Based of the reviews on Amazon I am looking forward to cracking this bad boy open."
1,Like eating dry leaves,"I've read many certification books, but this one was far and away the driest book I think I've ever read. On every page I'm thinking, ""Oh, no - not another page..."" The book is great on technical-ese; but the authors don't seem to get it when it comes to readability. No personal notes, no analogies to help keep the reader's interest - only pure technical information, and the more detailed, the better. Woe to you when you get to the SS7 section!I don't really have anything good to say here, unfortunately. I'm about to order a different CVoice book to study. Anything could only be a step up. If anyone says that this book is easy to read, well, they've been paid by Cisco Press to say it, IMHO."
1,serialization delay not relevant?,"From page 168, ""serialization delay is not covered because its influence on delay is relatively minimal."" Why do the authors think we need fragmentation? They seem to think it's needed because of propagation delay. I don't think the authors understand ""Voice over IP Fundamentals."""
2,Fragmentation is necessary because of serialization delay,"Fragmentation is necessary because of the time it takes to output bits in large frames on slow serial links. This time is called serialization delay and it is relevant for low-speed interfaces where delay-sensitive voice packets might need to wait a long time while a long frame is pushed out the interface, at say, 64 Kbps. Propagation delay is not the issue. This seems like a very basic telecommunications 101 issue that the authors should not have gotten wrong."
4,Thank you guys,This book looks into the soul of women with an amazing honesty and clarity that is both painful and enlightening. There is a need for healing in our communities and this book goes a long way towards starting the process. These 2 women deserve thanks.
5,What deliverance from God can do!,"It is awesome what the grace of God can achieve. Sometimes, it seems as if there is not way we can take another step. Then God steps in and picks us up. God's continued blessings on your works and your life."
4,"Very warm, but a bit stiff","The coat is as warm as I need it to be (maybe even a little warmer than i expected). It seems to be well-sized (LT fits nicely for me, not always a forgone conclusion). Overall the coat is of heavy construction and appears to be ready to last a long time. I have found that the coat is rather stiff, particularly when I sit down, causing it to bunch up rather awkwardly."
3,Very warm but restricts motion,"Fits very well and is very warm. In fact, the temp. really needs to be in the teens or you going to get sweaty. If warn with the matching bibs the coat doesn't allow for much free range of movement while working."
5,Great,"very nice jacket, very well made, runs a little big because a medium fit my son who normally wears a large."
4,nice coat,I bought this coat for my dad since he works outdoors. He says he is happy with the coat and I must believe that since my dad is not the easiest person to buy gifts for. =]
3,We Shall See,"I got this coat for my husband for Christmas..it arrived the other day, when I took it out of the box this thing was so stiff it would not straighten out..till I put it next to our wood stove. Its 25 below zero here and stays like this most of the winter, he has all the other carhartt warm clothing and none we stiff as this..I stayed away from the carhartt jeans-pants because they were so stiff..everyone says they soften up after a year or so of washing..anyway..I hope the jacket works out in this cold..I hate to think we have to wash it a few thousand times before its a comfortable ware."
4,extreme aritcic coat,great coat i like it better than the traditional because material does not fray up not as warm as they say dont think it is made in usa overall very good second one
4,Warm but big,"I got X Large. It is slightly too big. It has tons of great and large pockets. Its WARM! A bit too stiff, but to be expected because of durability."
1,20000 years history a new mexico...,Not what I was looking for. I will donate to the local Library.Next time I won't buy unless I can look inside.Thank You
3,good but..........its aight,"long and boring but good and logical movie funny if you dont laugh at punchlines but laugh at people geting shot or beat up he shot dude ""too bad for dogg guess we only live to die"" i thought that was very funny good suprise ending"
2,Not as good as expected,"I put this on all my plants and surrounding areas and still had deer tracks right into the area. I also noticed deer chewing on my plants. I'm pretty sure the product wasn't washed off, as it didn't snow until a few days after it was applied. Disappointed because this isn't cheap."
3,keep rabbits away but some plants never recovered,The product definitely repelled the rabbits but some of my petunias and especially snapdragons did not recover. Leaves died and several snapdragons have not recovered in the last 3-4 weeks with constant nursing. Most petunias ok except for leaf damage. Hostas were discolored but OK.
3,Disappointed,"I used this product last year with wonderful results. Yes, you do have to battle the bottle so to speak as the product tends to clog the nozzle. I have been told to add water or an asprin tablet and I did find diluting it somewhat helped. Some batches seems to be more troublesome then others. HOWEVER, this year we either have one deer or several who no longer mind the odor and keep right on munching the salad bar in my backyard. Very frustrating because even if I spray multiple times a week they still keep right on munching. I'm sort of at a loss as to what to do next."
3,Plantskydd Deer Repellent,"It works. Keeps deer away. Foul smelling stuff. Flies like it. Problem is the sprayer keeps clogging. I had to use a different, more heavy-duty spayer. Very frustrating to use the supplied sprayer as it clogs constantly. But, like I said, the product definitely keeps deer away from my shrubs, which they were destroying."
3,Trigger not good,"I have purchased this product in the past. Seems to work ok. Terrible if you get it on your hands (good luck getting the smell off) USE GLOVES. Mainly the biggest issue is the nozzle/trigger is just awful. If it works, it does not last long. The liquid is thick and it seems to clog very easy; even the very first use. This bottle I could not get it to spray, in the past it worked for a couple plants then got clogged...."
4,Deer Repellent: Pantskydd,So far so good. The deer have left the blueberry bushes alone. I applied the spray more than a month ago.
2,Was not what I wanted,"I ordered this product in order to keep deer away from my birdfeeding area. After reading the literature that came with the product, I called the sellers. A very nice gentleman told me I probably should not use it around birds, so I returned the product and received a refund. So, the 2 stars really reflect the fact that the product did not suit my needs. But the sellers were very helpful and polite. And I would not hesitate to use the product in the manner the product is designed to be used."
5,Compelling and with a lot of depth.,"This film was excellent. It raises some very complex issues that are so pressing to contemporary society. In many ways this movie is extremely unnerving. Words such as democracy and freedom are tossed around so easily these days...often in the name of distorted political posturing. However, those words also carry with them very high ideals. After watching this film, how might you think about your rights and freedoms today? Don't take my word for it. See it for yourself and you decide what is most compelling about this film."
2,as the title reads...STRANGE,"No doubt a good review of what can happen in our paranoid times. BUT, it takes a great deal of patience to stay with this film. Also the switching back and forth from the film lead and the actual man involved in this story can be confusing.I am afraid after a half hour I found myself numbed by the prologue and turned the film off."
5,Recommended,"The Prime Number Theorem is one of the really great theorems of mathematics, first broached by Gauss and Legendre. I have always to wished to understand the theorem and ancillary material better, particularly the proof. With this book my desire has been satisfied. The book is well organized, the development rigorous, the proofs understandable. The material is well-motivated and the historical asides greatly enhance the text. The book is suited for self study; the material is covered at the beginning graduate/senior undergraduate level."
1,sad blatherings of a misogynistic redneck con man,"This sad, poorly written ramblings, of a white trash red neck pseudo intellectual, self inflated polygamist.This creature was the lead character in a reality show about the sordid life of his poor sad wives and children.It creeps me out to think that I actually put money in his disgusting pockets.His life has fallen apart, all the kids have left him, his two other wives hit the road after coming to their senses.Please don't buy this book, thus rewarding this creepy lizard of a human being.His kids have myspace accounts discussing how they hate him, and are afraid to be alone with him.Google his name before you reward him for mentally abusing his wives and children by buying this trash.yeeech, I need a shower after thinking about this freak."
1,Not Educational,"This book is a long litany of terrible things that can happen to a child, it is hard to believe that it all happened in real life and not in an author's imagination. Further than that there is no advice on how to live, no advice on how to make a marriage (with any amount of wives) successful. This book seems all about shock value .If you want to get down in the pit and waller with the author....go ahead. I would prefer to spend my money on something more uplifting."
1,Psycho - Delusional,I read the first few pages after seeing the TLC special and tossed it aside. The man is a misogynistic deviant who has schnookered one too many woman already in his lifetime. If you're looking for some sort of guidance for you own life you'd be better off heeding the words of Jack Handy.
5,A Visionary,"Many peolple complain about how things are but do nothing except ask ""why?"". . . this man has asked, ""Why not!"" and i think he is a brave man for doing so. He has set a tone for other men to follow and by all indications has truly put his family first. A feat that many profess, but so few actually accomplish.I loved the final chapter. Deep, very deep, yet refreshingly simple. It truly should be read by every father in America. I have recommended this book to every friend I have and I cannot say enough good about it. Truly inspiring!"
4,Refreshing,"In the mundane world of popular music today ie., Brittany, In Stink, etc., it is refreshing to listen to the music of James Mee. Original melodies, powerful emotions, and thought provoking lyrics all come together in some of the finest song writing of our time. It is amazing that real talent often goes virtually unnoticed and the white bread ""boy Bands"" sell zillions of records. Do yourself a favor and purchase ""You Are All That I Will Ever Need""."
1,LEARY,I bought this grape seed oil to be a carrier oil for my lavender. First off the package arrived late. The packaging was sub standard. It did not have a safety seal and was wrapped sloppily with white bandaging tape. It also smelled unlike grapeseed oils Im familar with.I bought 4 bottles to share with my friends. We all were reluctant to use it. I will have to throw it away. The seller does not refund shipping so it would not be worth the cost to ship it back. this whole purchase has made me leary of amazon as well. They could not do anything for me since they stated this was a 3rd party sale. Ive learned a lesson at a cost.
1,bad bad bad waist of money,"this oil is exactly like the ""wheat germ oil"" that i bought a while ago..........bad. so enraged. i spent money on something i don't know what it is.long story short....the seller took some plastic bottles and filled them with vegetable oil if not worse. sealed them with black tape and send it to me.i'm furious. do not buy from this seller.you'll regret it. if you don't believe me, try and you'll see. I would not recommend it to anyone. what a scam!!!!!!!!:("
5,Listening with the Heart,"J. Philip Newell is a well-respected sage of Celtic Christianity, which has enjoyed a deserved revival in the past two decades because of the beauty of its language and its vivid imagery.In ""Sounds of the Eternal: A Celtic Psalter,"" Newell has drawn inspiration from the oldest hymnbook of the Judeo-Christian tradition, the Psalms, and combined them with images and rhythms of Celtic spirituality. The resulting prayerbook can bring refreshing streams to any soul traversing a spiritual desert.This reviewer found the book to be best used when its prayers are prayed aloud in solitude, to give the magnificent language an opportunity to be heard by heart as well as mind. Added to the language are rich illustrations, which combine the Psalms' Hebrew history with the vivid jewel tones of Celtic art, creating designs that serve a nearly-iconic purpose for meditation.Newell's book is a worthy addition to anyone's library of spiritual resources"
5,a stellar disc,I play the Shostakovitch recording so o0ften I am afraid I will wear it out it is so good. Thanks for the fast delivery as usual and good quality. Patty
2,"Lexmark, so not so good","You get what you pay for. It's Lexmark, so it's inexpensive and not so great quality. And I'm using Lexmark ink with it. Doesn't dry quickly, and the quality of the print isn't that great. I'm going back to HP for my next paper/printer combo."
4,Lexmark Photo Paper,I love the Lexmark Photo Paper. I have a new granddaughter so we have been taking alot of pictures. I pop out the card and print up pictures on my photo printer. The pictures always are beautiful.
1,not worth the time; uninteresting,emotionally raw. the plot was unfulfilling. the main relationship never developed to a good point.. witness 2 unstable people hurt each other and living horrible lives
4,Gegen die Wand,"This is one of those films that neither of us knows how it got into our queue. It turned out to be pretty good, though. If you have any squick for cutting, this is not your film. Otherwise it is fairly tame and a very realistic love story, once you cut through the semantics surrounding it. It was also a lovely film, typical German high art and cinematography. I really enjoyed being exposed to new actors (literally in some cases)."
4,Immigrant drama looks like Turkish remake of Sid and Nancy,"This fierce drama about the doomed love of two Turkish immigrants in Germany looks like an Ottoman remake of Sid and Nancy. Punctuated by the songs of a female singer and her band in Istanbul, it tells the story of Cahit (Birol Unel) a middle aged drunk and widower who has just attempted suicide by crashing his car into a wall head on (hence the title). In a hospital ward in Hamburg he meets the twenty one years old Sibel (nicely performed by porn actress Sibel Kekilli), and they soon agree to a fake, sexless marriage in order that she can escape her conservative family. While they both initially agree that this will be a marriage of convenience, hot tempered Cahit will eventually be unable to stand the jealousy caused by Sibel's promiscuous life. A violent tragedy will soon ensue. Another great film about the difficulties and alienation faced by immigrants in Europe."
5,"The most intense, heart-wrenching film I've ever seen.","Think of a punk rock version of Dr. Zhivago on amphetamine. Well - that's not QUITE it, of course. But it's quite a ride. One of the most MOVING film experiences I've ever had. I really can't even BEGIN to coherently analyse the film in any way that doesn't deteriorate the synaesthesia that the experience requires. Just SEE it!! Please. I BEG you. Honest - you'll thank me later. The soundtrack is absolutely incredible, too. It's actually got me buying up all kind of new music that I'd never really considered. In short - perhaps this is putting it a BIT dramatically - if you don't cry during this film - you're not human."
2,"i didn't like the story, ive seen this happen alot to people","usally a see a movie to escape , this movie is depressing and a little sick, i don't care to watch Sibel's actions again. The acting was good but the story is horrible. When you watch the trailer you thing your watching a love story instead you get this girl Sibel who's a whore that cheats on her man , i am sure thier pently of women out there that act this way, i just don't care to watch such a thing again. The film was top notch dvd transfer, music was good in the film. but i never want to see this thing again, if i had the dvd i would be in the garbage. two stars , one for acting and one for music"
5,Incredible. Heartbreaking. Fierce. Indescribable,"I'm sure more than a few US moviegoers were left a bit flummoxed when the 2005 ""Top Ten"" lists started coming out from ""important"" reviewers and - lo and behold - there sat a German film about Turks smack-dab in the mix and often in the pole position.Believe the hype. This fierce, almost indescribable film will blow you away with its intensity and ineffably heartbreaking ending. The beautiful Sibel Kekilli launches a film career like she was shot out of a cannon (well, her non-""adult"" film career, if you catch my drift). Birol Ünel puts on a jaw-dropping performance. Director/Screenwriter Fatih Akin is brilliant. Full stop. This movie took the Best Director and Best Film awards at the 2004 European Film Awards.The German title of this film is ""Gegen die Wand"" which means ""Against the Wall."" The English title is almost better. Even director Akin has said so. ""Head-On"" has connotations at two or three different levels."
1,Why !,"This is unbelieveable. I thought the last movie I saw was the worse movie I saw. This takes the cake. The story made absolutely no sense. It starts out with a kid getting kicked out of school and cursing out his mom. he gets sent to texas to live with his uncle and the story just goes down from there. the kid narrates the story talking about his day to day life with his uncle and his wife. not really sure what his uncle does, he's either a drug dealer or a club owner. the movie goes back and forth between the two. why the kids mom sent him to live there is beyond me. everyone uses the f and b words in every sentence. they're all ghetto as i dont know what, the uncle cheats on his wife constantly, she knows it and says ""he owes it to her"" to marry her...ughh..its stupid. dont ever in your life buy this movie. i cant even give this a good review. the movie is pure garbage. the stupidity doesnt end."
2,Save your money,"The best thing about this album by far is the cover art. If you purchase it, I suggest you hang it on the wall, but don't play it. There are at best 2 good tracks on the whole thing. The bulk of this recording sounds like watered down r&b pop. If you like syrupy ballads by Boys II Men, then give this a listen. I also own the album 96 Degrees, which is one of the best performed, best engineered reggae albums out there. If someone recommends Third World, that would be the album to get."
2,MORE OF THE SAME,"THE THREE NEW SONGS ON THIS RECORD ARE MORE OF THE SAME TYPE OF MUSIC TO WICH THIRD WORLD HAS US ACCUSTOMED TO. GOOD PURCHASE IF YOU DON'T HAVE OTHER RECORDS, BUT IF YOU HAVE PRIOR RECORDS IT IS ! JUST MORE OF THE SAME!"
2,Arms for Spain,"Howson's book is clearly well researched and documented. He does give the reader a good idea of the machinations behind the supplying of arms to both sides during the civil war. His thesis posits that the Republicans were denied and cheated out of arming themselves against the Nationalists. The nationalists however faired far better with the support of mussolini and Hitler. Europes reluctance to funnel military aide, under the pretext of nonintervention, to the Spainish government is presented as both nearsighted and duplicitous. That being said, Howson's book is a tough and ""crowed"" read. His attention to detail, in this case weaponry, is beyond a laymens appreciation or tolerance. His entire premise can be obtained from his conclusion, far more readily than traversing the 200 plus pages. For anyone knowledgable in the area of ""Janes"" weapons catalog, this is a must read. Beyond that, look elsewhere. Try orwells ""Homage to Catalonia"" as an interesting into to the Spanish Civil War."
1,Wrong Item Number & Description!!!!!,"I really wanted the WATCH IN THE PICTURE. When I received the watch, it was entirely different. I called the retailer it was shipped from, and they told me the description and item number was wrong for this picture. The watch I received has the number KC2446. I had to send it back and Amazon promptly refunded my card. Hopefully this will be corrected soon."
5,Great Fiction,I really enjoyed this short story. Liked the parts about the children and their dog the best....Cute.
5,Great Machine,"This is a sweet machine, definitely a desktop replacement option. I would suggest this for office work. For home users I would suggest the R or the A series. I use this machine at work, and have an X series at home. I have been a laptop user for years, and these are the reasons why I chose the T-Series:(1) The keyboard feel is the best there is out there, hands down(2) best weight - 5lbs as opposed to others which can weigh as heavy as 8lbs (*cough* dell *cough*)(3) a whole slew of interchangeable ultrabay options(4) thinklight!(5) build and quality"
3,It just doesn't have a fresh clean scent,"It's ok. It's nice that it can switch from hard wood to tile. I just used this product for the first time since I finally finished using the bottle of Old English floor cleaner that came with the machine. I cleaned the kitchen floor first and it seemed to do all right. I did miss the clean scent that the Old English cleaner had. Next I cleaned the linoleum in the bathroom. It didn't seem to get the floor as clean as the Lysol cleaner. It didn't scrub the hairspray residue off the floor like the other cleaner does. And again, I missed the clean smell from the Lysol. The smell of this cleaning fluid borderline stinks. I don't know why Hoover had to mess up a good thing but I wish they wouldn't take the Old English cleaning fluid off the market. If I have to choose between cleaning ability and good scent or a fluid that is versatile but stinks I would choose the first one."
4,"Works, but use a LOT less than they tell you to!","I bought this for my wife--kinda had to since I also bought her the Floormate for xmas... She said that the directions make it WAY too concentrated. She was using 1/3 cup instead of 2 cups (or something like that). This is great news to me, since it means the same bottle will last a lot longer! Overall, we've only used the floormate a couple times, but it seems to do a great job on our tile. Get's it clean, and no residue (especially when diluted properly--i.e. about 1/5 the recommended amount...)"
3,Should have stocked up,"Hoover should not have discontinued the original cleaing solutions that worked with this machine. I way preferred the smell of the original ones. I use it mostly on wood floors, so the convenience factor was not an issue for me."
4,WORKS WELL,I own the Hoover Floormate and this solution works really well. It doesn't smell bad but there is nothing really special about the scent. This solution is rather expensive in local stores but Amazon has a really fair price.
2,hoover floor scrubber cleaner,leaves film/streaks on the quarry tile; use less than manufacturer recommends. i haven't tried the grout cleaning product yet.
4,Smell? What smell?,"I can't smell this stuff. If it has an odor, it must be really faint. Anyways, this stuff seems to clean just fine with my H3044 scrubber. The only thing I don't like about it is that it looks like brown water to begin with."
4,floor to floor cleaner,"Works great run it twice a week. Deep cleans the tile and the linoleum. Better than using a mop, does not streak or leave dirty spots. Good at scrubbing out the grout between the tiles. The grout was looking very dull and gray. Fast delivery, will order again when I start getting low."
1,Worst customer service ever,"I wish I had never tried to purchase anything from Allergy Be Gone and will certainly never do so again. They shipped the wrong items. When I tried to return the items every time I called and actually got to speak to a person to get permission for a return (so they would not charge me a restocking fee), as soon as I said I want to make a return I was disconnected. Finally after repeated e-mails I received their return shipping instructions. I was told I would receive my refund within 3 days of receipt of the return. I made the return through Fed-X on July 3 and I'm still waiting for my refund. I've contacted them twice. The first time I was told I would receive a full refund but not when. On July 21 I was told the refund would be posted to my account that day or early on the 22nd. It's the 24th and still no refund.I know Amazon has a policy of making the customer whole in these type of situations so I guess that's what I'm going to need to resort to."
1,Way to expensive! It isn't Gold you know,"I have been using this product in my hoover floormate machine for years. The smell seems fine to me. However, I cannot believe the price on this product. I can buy it elsewhere for around $7.00. Who would spend $50.00 for this product? Are you nuts??? I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon, but cannot believe this."
5,"Janacek: Orchestral Works - Danube; Moravian Dances; Suite, Op. 3",It is exactly as advertised and I even received it a few days early! Thank you for the great service.
3,CGFNS exam prep guide by Jack Rudman,This is an excellent review book for CGFNS preparation. It covers the the almost all the topics of a graduate nursing program. Also it is presented in the same fashion that we can use it for NCLEX-RN exam
1,Rediculous price.,"The price whoever is selling this item for is totally out to lunch. You can buy these all day long for around five bucks, give or take from several different sources. And that is in most caliber choices. It pays to shop around. This posted item is NOT A BARGAIN!!! The reason I rated this with one star is because they don't have stars in the NEGATIVE catagory!"
3,Beautiful,"It may be out of date and of more historical value, but it is fun to look back at. It's amazing to see the progress Nashville's made in the past 10 years. The photography is gorgeous. It's a fun book to flip through."
4,Funny pillow but smaller than I thought,My co-worker loved this pillow! It was well made. It was smaller than I thought. It was very durable though. The four stars is because it was smaller than expected.
4,I'm retired in writing! Cute gag gift!,"I knew the size was going to be small, just big enough to get a laugh out loud from my husband. He has been retired since 2006 but has just started stressing the point that ""I'm retired"" everytime he has been asked to do something. The words on the pillow were just exactly the words that he says - so it was the perfect Father's Day present. He opened it, tossed it on the couch and went back to watching golf on the TV...and he did not have to do anything all day long."
3,Retirement Gift,"I purchased this as a retirement gift and it will be great for a good laugh. It was smaller than I expected, but I think if will suit my purposes."
3,Not Acrobat 6.0!,I wish I had known that this was not going to cover Acrobat 6. The current version of acrobat does forms completely different than version 5. This is a dinosaur now.
1,Beware -,"This book is horribly outdated! If you have Acrobat 5, - fine. Or maybe not so fine... use the money you would have spent on this book and upgrade to the current Adobe version: Acrobat 7 as of Sept 2006...and beware of Wiley Books that don't specifiy the application version - - Wiley is notorious for this -- remember, when purchasing a Wiley book -- think twice if the version of the application is not specified.."
4,Two books that are the same with different titles,"Death by Misadventure and Cocaine Blues are the same book,but by either title the book is a fine first novel.As the series goes on Miss Fisher becomes a more finished . The only problem with Kerry Greenwood's books you have to buy them from a dealer in Australia for the most part . Poision Pen Press has printed about Five of series"
2,Is there something I don't know about German Grannies?,"Is Oma looking for a good time? Is that why the symbol for ""male"" is shown after the words?"
2,Quality and Quantity,"This book was a little disappointing. Not withstanding the fact that I'd ordered a new copy and received a second hand one with many of the pages written on, the content whilst generally good was rather brief and the pictures of theBirds were in my opinion poor quality."
3,it widen my knowledge,"this book had widen mt knowledege OF birds in SIngapore as it had also allow me to take it to the field to actually do study on birds to actually obvserve them in the nature.this book also tach about the behavior and nursing cycle of vairious birds,a ver interesting read for the biginner like me."
3,Stimulating Treatise,"Garret Sheldon's short work opens up a door previously pointed out by Katcham, in which Ketcham specified Madison amongst others believed the Ten Commandments, Sermon on the Mount,and Romans to be canonical. As most of Madison's personal papers may have been destroyed this work offers an insight not frequently explored, but certainly worthy of consideration."
4,Unexplored Avenues,"Sheldon explores an area of Madison's life most just generalize - his early education. Frustrated by the lack of direct Madison writings covering this early period, many authors choose simply to generalize his educational process. Sheldon uses evidence we do have about the people (John Witherspoon) and institutions (College of New Jersey) to help better define what shaped this Founding Father. Very helpful in understanding what motivated Madison - especially the time spent under the strong Calvinist influence of John Witherspoon and the College of New Jersey (Princeton)."
3,A Decent but Narrow Study,"Sheldon offers a pithy, engaging survey of Madison's political thought. It is certainly worth reading for any scholar of the American founding. Sheldon's paradigm, however, is too narrow and ultimately unconvincing. The thread underlying all of Madison's political thought - including his nationalist years and his time as a Republican leader - is a Calvinist worldview which informed his conception of fallen human nature. While Madison's time with John Witherspoon at Princeton undoubtedly helped shape his view of human nature, Sheldon attempts to force this interpretation into every corner of Madison's thought. This practice is ultimately detrimental to a full understanding of other influences."
1,Too long winded,"It started off boring and ended ok. I would not recommend this book to anyone who likes to read, it will bore you to death."
4,Adorable,"She's as cute as the picture, her wings have a iridescent color.a great addition to my fairy garden. A little over priced"
2,This is EXACTLY what your doctor tells you,"I found this book to be a regurgitation of what I had already been told by two pediatricians regarding my 4 year olds recently diagnosed asthma. Nothing new here at all. I was surprised that the doctors do not seem to acknowledge the large role diet plays in a condition such as asthma. I am not a doctor, however, even I can see the significant link between diet and health. Since my son's asthma diagnosis a month ago, I have dramatically restructured his diet and began supplementing him with magnesium. Guess what?! My son has shown significant improvement over the past 3 weeks! Even his allergies seem to have improved. I am proud to report my son hasn't taken a single asthma or allergy medication in two weeks. If you are resigned to a life of medication and supporting the multi-million dollar pharmaceutical company's, then this is the book for you."
2,Water Downed Doctor version,I agree with the other reviewers this is things I already know and have heard over and over. I was looking for something with more of a natural approach and this is not that. So if that's what you have in mind(natural approach) do not buy this book.
5,Silky Smooth Soul from A Legendary Mixologist,"Ron Trent just secured his ""legendary"" status with this CD. When I finally got his Urban Afro Blues double CD I could not stop playing it. I finally stopped playing, only to start playing this one over and over again. It is alot like his early stuff on Prescription, especially ""Comin Back"" - awesome production. ""Another Night"" is quite addictive as well! Come to think of it, ""Just Pilau"" is utterly incredible, too! This is my third Ron Trent mix CD and to this point I have to say it was money well spent. I am looking forward to future compilations.Ron, if you're reading this: KEEP THE MIXES COMING!!! YOU ARE A CREDIT TO HOUSE MUSIC AND THE CITY OF CHICAGO!!!!!!!!"
4,A fun read,"Art Gibney's first book is compilation of some of his short stories. Many of his stories have appeared in such publications as South Dakota Review, Tennessee Quarterly, The Bear Essential Magazine. His masterfully told tales illustrate what the contemporary rural Nevada could have been like. As the pages turn, let Gibney's imagination take you back to a time of a more simple but wilder (as he calls) Adaven a.k.a. Nevada. This book is delightful easy read that is a must for all us with the frontiersmen or women hidden away inside, or those who ponder what Nevada may have been like in earlier times."
3,More of a Ferris Wheel,"The title refers to the thrilling roller coaster the protagonist enjoyed after initial reluctance. ""Mean Streak"" had little of the thrills of a roller coaster and more of the plodding of a old steam engine.The references to the wild new legal territory for the attorney were too great in number to be justified. Characters were introduced with little coloring to match their supposed epic status. Some of the courtroom passages were intriguing, but I found it hard to visualize much of the other narratives. Maybe that's my own weakness, but I think some editing could have made for a more direct, hard-hitting novel."
2,The Macade Brothers,The book has typos which is weird. A whole section is repeated. Also the plot is very typical of Nora Roberts and leaves no suspense.
3,Rafe/Jared MacKade,"This was a fine book, could not stop reading it. Specially Rafe's story, very well written. I was able to laugh with the MacKade humor and antics. Even cried at the end of Rafe's story, very touching. Didn't particularly like Jared's story although it did have some good moments...like when Jared and his soon to be stepson were in the woods towards the end of the story. Overall it was a good read and am looking forward to the next."
4,Some 80's lost jewels,"Fly back to the 80's to listen to some not so well known titles by memorable alternative/new wave bands. Enjoy inspired lyrics in Human League's ""Human"". Be introduced to Aztec Camera, a prime 80's British band, with its hit single ""Somwhere in my Heart"". A good collection of pieces not easy to find."
4,Happy with my purchase,I just took it as a carry-on for a business trip to Israel - it was very convenient to wheel through the aisle and fitted into the overhead bins perfectly. The pockets in front are very convenient. The best part is the laptop storage section - it was very easy to pull out my laptop and put it back in when going through
3,Very functional but poor support,"I travel weekly for business and love the functionality of this bag, it has just the right number of compartments in just the right places, very convient. I have had it for two years(in black) and haven't had a problem until recently. The handle is held on by two screws and where the screws penetrate the handle is rubber. The rubber split and the handle came off. I called their customer support several times and get put into VM. Finally contacted the operator and it appears they only have one person in customer support. I have sent an email and will see how long that takes to get a response. If it wasn't for the customer service issue I would highly recommend this bag to anyone who makes 2-3 day trips on a regular basis."
3,Enjoyable,It is nice to have a CD with all these great songs on it. I highly suggest you pick this up!
5,Awesome New Talent!,Laurie Moore is giving Sue Grafton and Janet Evanovich a run for their money! Cezanne' is a great character with a riveting back story. I cannot wait until the next book in the series is out.
2,Weak tester,"I bought this because of the construction look of the device and what an easy task it can do for testing. The light on this is so weak you really not sure if it is working. Contacted them and they said that is normal. Well sorry for them, they could of had a great product if built better."
4,"Excellent value,children loved them!","This bag is perfect for children.light enough for hiking or car camping.Well constructed and much better than any bag you can buy from the number one retail chain(apawl mart)LOL.No snag zipper is a big plus for anyone especially kids.Sizing is perfect for growing children or smaller women.Buy now,take care of it and your kid or wife wont need another bag for years."
4,Alexander - the Great?,"""Alexander: The Ambiguity of Greatness"" is a good book for those who have never read anything about Alexander before and are just beginning to learn about the Macedonian king. The book covers all the basics, from the first ride he took with Bucephalus, to his death at a young age. The controversial nature of Alexander's claim to the throne upon the death of his father, Phillip's murder being a possible conspiracy, is examined too. Overall the book is simple to read and informative.Review by: Adam Platts"
3,BUCEPHALAS WAS THE MOST INTERESTING CHARACTER,"Melville, the first among equals, wrote that to have a mighty book, a writer must have a mighty theme. Rogers delivers the ""mighty "" theme - Alexander - but does not deliver the mighty book. We never really ""GET"" Alexander: a bi-sexual, alcoholic sadist.The weakness of the title character's development aside, this book shines superbly as military history"
1,Not worthy of Alexander,"For inconvenient facts which he doesn't like, such as Alexander's sexuality, Rogers demands the most rigorous evidence good enough to satisfy a supreme court judge. For inconvenient facts which are undeniable - the murder of Cleitus, the purges, the burning of the Persian city, the tortures of prisoners, etc. - Rogers forgives, justifies, rationalizes, mitigates, papers over, whitewashes, or simply passes over. If Walt Disney ever decides to make an animated film of Alexander for children, Rogers would be its perfect consultant. This biography lacks the competence or the neutral, even-headed perspective required of a true historian of Alexander."
2,2012 Honda Civic Coupe Ventvisor???,"I purchased this product using Amazon's car selection menu to make certain this would fit my vehicle. After entering the information that I had a 2012 Honda Civic Coupe, the selection said it did fit that car. Having searched continuously for a ventvisor for my car for some time now, I was glad to finally find one that fit. However upon arrival, I took the visor still in packaging out to my car to make certain it looked like it would match before opening it, and it clearly was not for my car. Therefore, I want to make clear I'm not giving this product a bad rating, just wanting to inform others that if you are looking for something that fits the same model car that I own, look elsewhere. The model number of this product #192410 is what was the number on this listing and the same one on the product I received, but again, it will not fit a 2012 Honda Civic Coupe."
1,Window hits AVS In Chanel Ventshade,When closing the window it hits the Ventshade and reverses.The Ventshade is installed properly.I ripped them off and ordered the one with the tape that goes on the outside of the window chanel.The Ventshade that mounts to the window trim looks fine unlike the ones that mount to the painted surface of some vehicles.
4,Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid Review,Good product. Exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately packaging was not sufficient and item got minimally damaged. Price was a little high but otherwise I am a satisfied customer.
4,In case you were disappointed with the first season...,"I watched this after watching the first series which I personally was a bit disappointed with. This series reloads to give you more of what you saw in the first series but this time the creators do a much better job of fleshing out the characters. Everything is just more polished, including the animation that was already excellent to begin with. You could watch the second raid without watching the first season but you'll be missing out a bit on the various relationships between many of the characters. Unlike some series though, you won't be totally lost.I just wanted to do a quick review for those who have seen the first series and were also left feeling disappointed and wondering whether they should go for the second, I say yes. If you're just a casual fan of the anime genre, you can go ahead and skip the first season without missing out on too much."
5,Full Metal Panic! TSR,Great continuation of the original series. The expansion of the narrative and the world itself are well done and mirror the light novels and 2nd manga series.
5,Worth owning.... -Jult Warfell,"This series should have been a full season with an upcoming third. the First season was great, aswell as the 'FUMOFFO' series which also should have been a full series. -Jult Warfell"
2,IRECHARGE NEEDS IREFUND,COULDNT FIND POWER CORD TO FIT THIS PRODUCT.MY POWER CORD WOULD NOT FIT.YOU TAKE THE CHANNCE OF YOURS NOT FITTING.CUSTOMER SERVICE WOULDNT TAKE BACK.....I GUESS THEIR RETURN SHIPPING COSTS IS THE REASON.BUY THIS PRODUCT AT YOUR PERIL.
2,"item does not work, no customer service","my computer, a new Sony Vaio is not listed on their web site but i bought it. for some reason it does not add any time to my normal battery. i tried customer service but you can only get through to them via customer service and customer service does not answer. apparently I recharge has sold this company as they told me that they don't take calls there anymore. it does charge, but has no effect on my new laptop"
1,really lousy documentation,"Of course, by the time I got around to trying to use this thing and double-checking it would work on the laptop I needed to use it on at the moment, I had no idea where the compatibility guide had gone to. No problem, I thought, I'll just google it. Nope. Could not find the compatibility guide on the web using google. That's just amateur, there's no excuse for it not being on the web. And Amazon is not much better; I went to Amazon hoping for a link...when I clicked on the link for Technical Details, all I get is the stupid Amazon ad, no mention of the compatibility guide. What a bunch of morons. I'll never buy anything from this company again, and if I could find all the stuff, I'd take the $*#@!! piece of #^@! back. It was pretty darn pricey for such lousy documentation."
3,"iRecharge: good value for the money, especially on older laptops","The iRecharge has worked well for me, on older T40 class Thinkpad laptops for the past 4 months. Battery life seems to be consistent and it increases my run time from almost 2 hours to over 3.5 hours attaching the iRecharge with a fully charged battery.For the price, my experience until this week was ****. It is unfortunate that there are many laptops now available that do not have the correct power adapter to use the iRecharge. I just got a Thinkpad T400 and there is no adapter for the newer, 20V Thinkpad power connector. So I've downgraded this to *** as the company could have offered a broader range of power tips as an accessory and ongoing business.Given the wide variation in experiences, I'd purchase this ONLY from a vendor with a good replacement policy AND if the laptop power supply connector/voltage is explicitly referenced in the iRecharge supported device list."
1,terrible customer service,"Do not buy this battery, or anything else from cellboost. I have called and emailed cellboost a number of times to try to get a replacement cable, but there is no response, so my >$100 investment is now useless. I'd give them 0 stars if I could"
1,No T60 support,"Weak. All excited for a trip to Japan with this extra battery which says fits 1000s of laptops and all IBM/Lenovo. Well guess what, get home after making the 30 minute drive to Fry's and great, no plug for a T60 which isn't new at all. Thanks for nothing."
1,Doesn't work; what laptops run on 2.5A?,Customer service from cellboost doesn't exist for this product. TD said they bought from some other company but that company wasn't any help either. Tiger Direct doesn't refund shipping and this is not stated online. The product was defective. It didn't power my laptop for any length of time. The charge indicator lights lit up when button was pressed. In fact the lights depended on how hard the button is pressed. This is really suspicious. All of this may be my mistake because the input (or output) is limited to 2.5Amps (var. volt) and my laptop is 3.5A. However i am pretty sure there are few laptops with this power requirement. Also the extended list of laptop models includes many models i couldn't find on manufacturer spec lists.
5,It is a very good buy!,It is a great project management book with lot of free templetes. Writers explained everything very easily. Every project manager should have a copy of this book.
3,Reads like an early Deborah Crombie....,"If you want an easy to read and mildly entertaining book for a long flight somewhere-this is the book for you. The characters are sterotypical--including a career policeman with a failed marriage, his professional but meddlesome girl-friend, a troubled child, her caring teacher, an embittered husband (of the corpse-natch), and gypsies not much different from Auntie Mabel and Uncle Herbert who bought a camper for traveling around the U.K. Heck, this book isn't even scary. Granger will make a mistake if she marries the two main characters at some point--then there'll be no tension. Well, I read it anyway, but hey, I'm home sick today with a head cold."
3,the lesser known songs,"The album contains material that is generally heard in the background of the Buffy episodes, some of which didn't make a very big impact."
4,great CD,"I didn't fall in love with every song on this CD, but there are a enough songs like Sarah McLaughlin ""Prayer of St. Francis"" and ""Key"" that make this CD entirely worthwhile!"
3,Slight disappointment and strange track list,The tracklists shown on different websites are incorrect. The actual tracklist is1.Buffy main title theme- The Breeders2.Stop Thinking About It- Joey Ramone3.Bohemian Like You- Dandy Warhols4.Everybody Got Their Something- Nikka Costa5.Key- devics6.Sound of the Revolution- Lunatic Calm7.Ballad For Dead People- Dashboard Prophets8.Blue- Angie Hart9.Pavlov's Bell- Aimee Mann10.There's No Other Way- Blur11.Prayer of Saint Francis- Sarah McLachlan12.The Final Fight (Original Score)- Rob Duncan
3,Buffy soundtrack,"I have not purchased this cd yet. It looks okay, and gets points just for being a Buffy soundtrack. I've made my own Buffy soundtrack with the songs I think are great and are played at key moments in the show. Hardly any of the songs on this soundtrack are on mine, except for Prayer of St. Francis (which is a very good choice). I have no idea when any of these songs were played, but I hope to find out. I will be buying this though just because of the fact that its a Buffy soundtrack. If you are a fan of the show, you'll want it even if you disagree with the song choices."
3,Get the import instead...,"The UK version has twenty-one cuts, as has been noted before. One of those is a Christophe Beck score (Which score?) and two are different versions of the Buffy theme. It does NOT have Sarah McLauchlin's ""Prayer of Saint Francis,"" but it DOES have Cibo Matto's memorable ""Sugar Water,"" from ""When She Was Bad"". There are still a lot of songs I would like to hear, notably ""I'M THE MISSUS,"" from season 7, and Sarah McLauchlin's other important number, ""Full Of Grace,"" from ""Becoming, Part Two"". Maybe on a future album entitled ""Buffy's Graveyard of Forgotten Oldies.""Back to the point, though, this album reads like a full priced sampler of the British version. Why?"
1,This is a joke,"How can Buffy fans be expected to buy a CD when you can't even nail down a definite track list and some cover art. Virgin records is doing a horrible job of releasing the information to retailers and customers. I've seen at least 4 different track lists and twice that many complaints of a songs that were advertised but not on the CD. Until Virgin can figure out how to promote and sell a CD so that you *the customer* knows exactly what they're gettting, I don't love your odds of being pleased with whatever they send you."
3,I would spend the extra and get the UK version,"This one is OK, but the UK version has many many more tracks. 22 I think. Either one is a great buy for a Buffy fan though!"
3,Nice mixtape,"Even though this version of the soundtrack has less tracks than the UK release, I prefer this one because I can listen straight through without skipping. I find all the songs here very enjoyable and it would've been a perfect soundtrack if Coldplay's Warning Sign and Michelle Branch's Goodbye To You were included. Hopefully there will be more Buffy music released in the future."
4,Better than the first,"Unlike the first soundtrack for the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV show, I had remembered and liked all the songs on this album. Most of the tracks are from the recent (6&7) seasons. Though Dashboard Prophets from episode 2 season 1 (Darla and Luke entering the Bronze) is also included. The best part of the whole cd had to be the music from the last battle from Chosen. I personally love the music by Christopher Beck and the shows other composers."
4,Acceptable...,"This CD is definetly good...but it's missing some major tracks from earlier seasons. Such as ""Full of Grace"" by Sarah McLachlan (The track playing at the end of Becoming Pt. 2) and of course, ""Goodbye to You."" Really can't believe they left that out. Also, I thought the theme song was by Nerf Herder...that's what the credits always say. Anyways, this is a really great collection of songs for any Buffy fan, and really it's just a good CD for anyone. Virgin may have been a little messy about the way they went about the press releases, but I am happy with the final product."
1,yawns,Very dull collection of alternative songs. Would have garnered more stars if they had included more orchestral clips from the show like previous outings. Also begs the question...when do we get an ANGEL soundtrack?
2,The peace prayer is great,"I bought this CD just for The Peace Prayer by Sarah Mclaughlin. It is fantastic, but the rest is just trash. I would say down load that song on you I-Pod or MP3 and leave the rest alone."
3,"Solid, but the UK version is better","Frankly, I'd advise buying the UK version over this (just go to amazon.co.uk), because it has many more tracks and is hardly any more expensive.One little gripe I have with both versions: where's Anya's song ""Mrs.,"" from the episode ""Selfless?"" I love that song and I'm sorry it's not included. I hope we can someday get an album devoted to ""Buffy"" score music, as we now have from ""Angel."" This show has had some fabulous score music and I wish we could have it released on one CD."
3,A little disappointed,"First of all, I LOVE the first Buffy CD that was released, so when this CD came out I raced to the store to get my copy. Alas, I was not as pleased with this effort as I am with the previous CD. There were several songs that were sadly absent from this CD....although it does include a Sarah McLachlan song from season 2 that I'd been wanting....I guess you can't have it all..."
4,"Not as good as the first soundtrack, but...","If you're a fan of the show, you'll definitely want to own this CD. There are some excellent songs, such as ""Everybody Got Their Something"", ""Ballad for Dead Friends"", ""Blue"" (which was co-written by Joss Whedon), ""Pavlov's Bell"" and ""Prayer of Saint Francis"", a song I'd been dying to have ever since I heard it on the show. It was previously only available as an import from Japan. The last track, which is an instrumental is also excellent and sounds like something out of the ""Lord of The Rings"" movies. I was disappointed that other great songs from the show weren't on this soundtrack, but it was still really nice to have another CD available after the show ended. It's also nice that Joss Whedon participated in this soundtrack as well. It would have been better if there were more pictures in the booklet inside as well as more tracks, but I don't regret buying this CD at all. You can tell that real thought was put into creating it."
1,I'm not into it.,"These guys are a big deal these days. Many people in the darkwave scene consider this to be their favorite band. Speaking for myself, I have no idea why anybody would be fannatical about this band. Thye are way too soft, way to pretentious, and way to poorly produced. IMO, The Cluckshadows are the modern day goth version of a Hairband, only to make it worse they added in a little of the Backstreet Boys into thier rediculous live show. If you want to listen to real goth band than may I suggest Christian Death, or Bauhuas. Or if you insist on something more modern, how about My Dying Bride. Whatever you do, don't bother with these posers."
2,There is just too many better metal CD's out there than this,"I just could not get into this. To me, it was very repetitive. They use the same guitar chord progressions, and the singer (screamer) never changes his voice or range. So combined the repetitive guitar with the never changing vocals and you have a boring repetitive album. A lot of the songs on here you could not guess one from the other if the cd was set to random. ""Feeding on the Opiate"" and ""Detestation"" are the best two song on the album. I gave this album a star for every good song on it."
3,A good reference book,"Be warned, I am a pretty harsh grader.Well first off this edition does not contain the entire book in a pdf file for easy reading on a laptop/computer so that was definatly a minus. One of the reasons I liked 3DS Max 4 Bible was because you didn't have to carry around the entire book (I've had encyclopidia sets smaller that this folks).Other than that no real complaints. Newbies will not get much out of this one as this is more of a reference book and not a book of tutorials and techniques.The book is well written and give good (black and white) photos of what certain effects and/or modifiers look like. I give it 3 stars because its a solid reference book but when you think ""bible"" your kind of hopeing for more than refence."
3,Slightly dissappointed with this one,"Having previously owned Inside 3D Studio Max Vol 1-3, perhaps my expectations were too high. While the 3DSMax 5 Bible does have plenty of nice pictures and tons of simple tutorials, there's little educations value to this book other than a road map for doing tutorials. The author's style tends towards shallow overviews and sudden lessons, without much thought for explaining how to get the most from Max, what practices to follow, how to avoid pitfalls, etc. Indeed, one is liekly to learn more from Max's tutorials and reference guides than from this book. The Chapters on Maps & Materials were exceptionally dissappointing, offering little more than a guided tour of the immediately obvious.Having bought this book and read it cover to cover in good faith that it would indeed give meaningful coverage of Max 5's new features, I find myself hard pressed to recommend this book to fellow readers."
3,"Good Reference, but...","I am a Max user with intermediate skills. I was hoping to get a little more insight into some of the new aspects to Max 5 (particularly the lighting and optimizing it). Unfortunately, the book does not go beyond simple explanations in most cases and doesn't begin to suggest ways to optimize things to speed up rendering (a huge problem with GI and Radiosity). I was very disappointed with this, as it is worse than the tutorials that come with Max 5.That said, as a simple reference guide, it's good. I am glad I bought it, but it could have had more suggestions."
2,"Max 5 is big, this book is not!","I've been using Max 5 for about 6 months now and thought this book would be a good addition to the Discreet courseware... I was wrong! I get the impression the author ""rushed"" this book just to get it on the market. There is not much detail, and I feel there's much missing.One day while in a book store, I noticed the 3DS Max 4 Bible and took a look at it. It has twice the pages as the Max 5 book does! I mean the Max 4 Bible looks like how a bible book should look, THICK! What happend? Max 5 has many more and new features than in Max 4, like radiosity, and the unwrap UVW modifier, etc.If you are an absolute beginner, this book may help. But I'd save your $$ and stick with the Max tutorials, on-line help, etc.Disappointed."
2,Poor content and demos,"OK I haven't thoroughly read this book - I bought it as a supplement to max's courseware books, thinking it would go into more details on what can be done with the tools in max. Some of the demos in the book are laughably impractical. Example: placing a dozen or two omni lights against a plane to create a starry background? The author apparently isn't aware of real-life issues like render time.. Seriously, a new user is still better off using the 3ds max courseware, its short, but at least its informed."
1,Overpriced,"It is made from a very thin cheap piece of poly fabric that is folded in half and overlock stitched along the outside edge to keep the fabric from fraying. The ends of the overlock stitch are not well done and will unravel. The headband is 40"" long and about 2.5"" wide. The sticker price of about $3 is fair enough I suppose, but after adding shipping it is just way too much to pay for what you get."
5,Aviation Mechanic Handbook,"This is a great reference book, containing many formulas, conversion charts, & look up tables.Great to have even if you are not in the Aviation industry.Covers most Geometry, Electrical, Hydraulic, & Mechanical aspects.Also covers standard maintenance practices."
4,Perfect for your toolbox,A comprehensive handbook for any Airframe and powerplant mechanic. Perfect to throw in your box for whenever you need a quick reference on a particular question.
5,Great Reading!,"This book is packed full of information about this war that I didn't imagine existed from what I found (or didn't find) in other publications. This author has created a wonderful account of this seldom mentioned war, which was actually a turning point in American history, and saved it from forget. I think this book should be an education text on this war. I couldn't put it down!"
2,"Ughhh... totally barbaric, and unbelievable.","This book was another romance that I've found to be compared to pulling teeth. There was so little romance in this book, it was more, ""I'm going to marry you, and you have no say in the matter."" The 3rd book in the Connelly series dropped the ball. The 1st two were excellent. This one felt like the outsider of the series, it didn't stay true to many of the storylines that had begun in the previous books. I would not recommend this to anyone, unless they're reading the series, and want to know the few details that come across in this book that are relevant to the mystery of who is trying to kill off King Daniel."
4,suit the need,This book won't win an award but you are not looking for a Tolstoy version here. It is enjoyable and gives another facet for the series (The Connellys).
2,Terrible video quality ruins this excellent mini-series,"This is an excellent mini-series that I enjoyed watching on TV when it was first shown in the late 1970s. I hadn't seen it since and was therefore willing to take a chance on buying the only DVD version available. I don't normally buy a DVD unless the reviewers say the picture quality is good. But there was only 1 Amazon review which did not note picture quality and no reviews on the Web, but I took a chance anyway. Big mistake. The picture is awful, looks like it was dubbed off a video tape or TV broadcast. The focus in every scene is soft and the colors are washed out. I like to leave a negative review in cases like this to spare anyone else the grief of spending their money on junk like this."
1,aaaaaaaaawful!!!!!,This is the WORST romance I've ever read. There are too many characters. I skipped entire pages at the end. I didn't care for the main character at all. It was just bad all around. Absolutely no sex. Absolutely ridiculous actions by the characters. I was so not entertained.
1,NOT for young girls,"This book does not contain innocent romance. It is a marked change from Eva Ibbotson's 'A Countess Below Stairs' and 'The Reluctant Heiress'. The main character in this book, Harriet Morton, is a weak minded people pleaser. At one point in the book, she miscommuncates her intentions to speak on someone's behalf. She realizes that the man she wished to speak with expects to sleep with her. Instead of correcting her mistake, she dejectedly prepares to sleep with him. There is also table dancing in this book. By this point I quit reading. This is simply a cautionary review for those who are seeking clean books for their daughters or themselves."
3,Much Smaller than it looks,"This came in a smaller than expected box. The image looks bigger than what you get. I will see what the response is on Valentines day and update my review. Make sure this is not the only gift you have ready or she will be disappointed!! I will check back by 2/19/2011.OK- Valentines was here and she did like the little bear in the basket. I upped my rating a star. Everything was smaller than it looked... it was nicely packed... the soap was in the shape of a honey comb, all items had a bear theme with honey and almonds. Was OK, and she said she liked it, but she loved her other items more... It was ok as part of a barrage of gifts... Remember...If your ""honey"" aint happy, aint nobody happy:)"
5,HOney Bear Spa and Bath Set,"I received the Honey Bear Spa Bath and Body Set and the packaging was wrapped up like a present, not just in a box.A gift card was attached making mom feel like Christmas.The honey lotion was soft and creamy, not watery like cheap brands. The scent was wonderful and trulysmelled like almonds."
3,very thin material,These covers look very nice but are made of very thin metal and have doubts as to how long they will last.
5,a must read,"if you want to know the emotions and motivations that really lies behind the smiles and sound bites of the new world order global elitist wannabes (ie.politicians, media, royalty, aristocracy,bankers,spooks,and would be henry kissingers) then read this book. its a jaw dropping rollercoaster of a ride through history the like of which you've never seen before (with the very great exception of DAVID ICKE) he may be wrong about some of the details but after much research and thinking i know that the author is chillingly correct about the big picture which this book covers. its a great read! if anybody wants to e-mail me on the subjects covered in this book please feel free. NO SPOOKS."
2,"Interesting, but lacking in documentation. Has some errors.","This book is a fascinating read, but isn't a good source of factual information. The author makes several statements that can be easily confirmed as false. He may be right about the possibility of a group of 300, but he doesn't provide enough convincing evidence. He hurts his own credibility somewhat.There are other books on this subject, that are much better documented and more reliable. ""The Naked Capitalist,"" by Dr. W. Cleon Skousen is one such book."
4,the committee of 300,please check out john colemans book out as it is very well written and researched. it will enlighten the reader as to how and why the super rich and powerful families intend to enslave the human race.
1,He did it again.,"Lacking in documentation? It would be more accurate to say he has NO documentation, (it is hard to cite what does not exist).What is more, he seems unaware that 'Foreword' and 'Forward' have different meanings."
1,Makes the National Enquirer look like the New York Times,"You remember in the 10th grade when your English teacher said you needed to back up your opinions, however fervently believed, with evidence? Well, Mr. Coleman was absent that day. (Docked one star - a very gracious star at that - for his writing ""style"", a frothy, chaotic, incoherent mess. And for ignoring hard evidence to the contrary that the Beatles wrote their own music - Mr. Coleman claims someone named Theo Adorno did it, you guessed it, to brainwash America's youth....."
2,Sort of works,"I installed this on a 1989 Montero. It was pretty darn close to fitting, but not there. On the bottom, I had to dremel off about 1/4"" to get it to fit. Once I did this it fit like a glove and looked great. The only bad thing is that some of the rigidity is lost when you have to cut off the bottom. Maybe it fits other years better, but it was only ""close"" on the 1989. I did still use it."
1,Instructions poor...better products out there,"I'm an art teacher...I've done plenty of casting, but the instructions for this need to be rewritten. They state leave 1.5 inches at the top after filling with water....not enough space for the powder...and if you pouring then mixing... then the product has different consistencies. [...]."
1,The worst windows 2000 book I've read to date,This book has been very poorly edited with numerous typos in the text and the illustrations which make it confusing and frustrating to read - I would hesitate to buy another book from this publisher again. Buy something else instead - this isn't worth the price.
3,"If not for the Stomper applicator, I would pick another kit.","I bought this only for the Stomper applicator which is nicer thanother ones I have seen with Surething and Avery's own applicator. The included software did not support the printable sleeves and labels, while Surething CD Labeler Deluxe 4.0 does and also other brands of sheets. This kit did not come with vinyl sleeves, instead it cam with printable paper sleeves, which is anoying because your CD label is hidden and thus you have to print you sleeve to convey what it is. The included software only supports Stomper and Avery's own sheets. this all makes sence once I learned that Avery bought Stomper [...]."
1,dont do it,"Purchased item in Oct 2011. Was never happy with water spout part,today is 032512 and its been replaced for about a month now. It was workingbut never very well...water spray has gaps, hard to change to different sprays.The handle, now has an issue.. sigh... it worked wellfor about 4 months, now all the sudden is hard to move?"
2,Seriously mishandled,"I find it rather difficult to share the opinions of many other people who view this show as one of the lost treasures of the musical theater. I think of it as a missed opportunity - a lovely, intimate story and fascinating characters which could make for a wonderfully delicate musical; instead we get . . this. Some of the music is indeed ravishing; generally when the principal women are involved it is quite charming. But when the men open their mouths, its clear we are in amateurland. Just try - try - to listen to ""Floozies"" and not burst out laughing. The score swings wildly between folksy ballads and pure unadulterated 70's trash (much of it obviously inspired by Burt Bacharach.) What a show this could have made! What a shame."
1,Not what you may expect,"I was dissappointed by this product because Amazon's description is misleading. I am unsure if this is Amazon's error or the manufacturer's. You are lead to believe it has screws and this sort of security actually contributed to my purchasing of the device, when really it is just glue alone that attaches it. Even the instructions by the manufacturer show screw holes in the product that do not exist. It is just a visual deterrant wheras In the amazon description it seems to be more. Instead purchase the other model number that actually has the screws."
1,Not As Advertized. Don't Purchase this Product.,This unit had no holes or screws to secure it to a surface. It also didn't come with that nifty looking cover pictured in the ad. The pictures are all wrong and nothing like the unit itself. It only comes with glue. Don't buy if you need true security.
5,"American ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy""","This is a really amusing series of tapes for the most part written by Mark Wolverton, author of ""The Science of Superman."" The hapless Dirwood Funnt captains an interstellar garbage scow on adventures on the planet Barbatus, planet of bearded men, and gets caught between the warring Space Brains and Winarians. Dirwood is really funny and the dopey supporting characters are hysterical."
2,Not as great as people reviewed,"I had this book for a class a little while ago and I have to agree with my professor that this book skips over a lot of important stuff in the ""history of Comic Art"". There is not nearly enough info about main stream publishers (Marvel and DC) and yet there are pages upon pages of independent works from the 70's. Don't get me wrong it's valuable information, BUT it's not balanced. It's like this book was written in the early 80's and written based on personal experiences and comic book tastes rather than hard research."
4,description is for a different book,"As others have noted, the description for this book on Amazon is one for an entirely different book. The book listed is fiction whereas the description is for a non-fiction book."
1,Boring!,"This is an album for people who do not want anything to happen in their music. Monotone simple dub beats that go nowhere, each song the same thing......repetitive and dull...I have no idea why others gave this 5 stars...."
4,The real malice and misfortune,I was so happy when I finally found this cd at Amazon because I couldn't find it in the stores. If you like Those Unknown then you'll love this cd. It's true to their sound and just flat out cool.I defiently recommend them.
3,Great Music .....BUT!,"The music is fine but the problem is Hippo. Why in the devil do you record companies keep putting out the same old songs that you put on the last record. Hippo's 2 cd collection was nice but it had the same tunes that the MCA cd's had on theirs. The Dells recorded almost 3 albums of Burt Bacharach tunes all arranged by the great Charles Stepney yet, you guys at Hippo and MCA keep pushing the same old 2 dozen songs. Why don't you put out ""Sweet As Funk Can Be"" or ""The Dells Sing Dionne Warwick."" Then Hippo would really be hip."
4,old school love songs favorites,"This is a nice cd to add to your old school collection. It doescontain just about all of their best hits. If anyone is browsingthrough your music collection,they will ask you do you have anyold dells music? This cd does feature my favorite dells hits,they are: Open up my heart, The love we had stays on my mind, and Heart is a house for love. If for no other reason buyit so you can have the extended version of Stay in my Corner. You will enjoy. JayelpriceBeltsville,Md."
1,Predictable,"I read alot of suspense thrillers/""who done it's"" and this was predictable from beginning to end. I did enjoy the character of Marvin but that was about it. By the 3rd chapter, you knew exactly how the rest of the book was going to turn out. However, I did read the entire book even though I could have stopped at he beginning and told you exactly what would happen. It was written like a first attempt at writing a suspense thriller."
5,MPD Angle Perfect,"I liked the author's explanation behind the killer's psychological state. Thought the killer was portrayed quite well. The investigating detectives and their speech patterns fit perfectly with the location and contemporary style. Realistic and fast-paced, this book kept my interest going. I recommend this one."
2,USA Made for TV Movie,"I'm a big fan of Mystery/Thrillers and I hate to write a bad review, however this book reminded me of a made for TV movie. The book has it's moments...but overall If you've read more than one serial killer thriller...I think you will ultimately be disappointed with this book. It is a fun read..but it is no way near a five star book. I apoligize to the fans of this author..but I had to give my 2 cents on this one."
1,Don't waste your Money on Wayne's Dead,"This was a huge disappointment to me after hearing all of the hype about this book. I was able to guess who the killer was from the moment they introduced the person. There were a few attempts to make you think it was someone else, but very poorly done with little to no character development to make any of these attempts very believable. Perhaps I have just read too many murder mystery books but there was no cliff hanger for me in this one. I would not waste my money another book by this author."
1,AM I MISSING SOMETHING!?!?!?!?!??!?!,"My book club read this recently and all but one of us were left thinking....huh? At the end.This was not a good book,why?Withought spoiling anything:-Only 180pages-NO, I mean ZERO mystery. None. You know what's what in the first 10 pages-No character development. We don't know much about who they are or why they behave the way they do-Paints men as dumb and sex obsessed. (Okay maybe some are, but this was a bit extreme). The characters in general were one-dimentional and boring.-Bad dialogue. If this were a movie, you wouldn't watch it. Worse than a soap, CTFrench obviously didn't talk to ANY black people before she wrote the dialogue for her black characters.Overall, CTF had a good idea but totally wack development. I only finished it because I kept waiting for a shoe to drop, it never did.Don't waste your time or money."
5,BEST FICTION OF THE YEAR!!!,"""Wayne's Dead"" by Christy French, is without question the best book of fiction I have read in months! Suspense, and tension on every page. The characters are believable and the plot is one that could just as easily have been heard while listening to the nightly news. I think this writer is awesome!"
1,Wha what what?,"I bought this book because of all the five star reviews on this page. I cannot believe that those people are not shills. Read the other low reviews if you want to really know what's up. This was the most predictable book I've ever read, and that includes the ""Choose your own adventure"" series. I had to write this, my first review ever, because I felt so burned.But by all means, if you think ""Rush Hour"" is a great example of a karate movie, then this might be the book for you."
3,"Good story but,","Christy French has written a good story with Wayne's Dead. I would have given her book 4-stars had she not given up the 'bad'guy' so early in the story. In my opinion, doing so took away from the suspense of the story line making the remainder of the story predictable. Nothing personal intended, just thought this would have been a great story if she would have made the reader wait just a little longer."
5,I'm Hooked!,"I am so hooked on the great stories by Christy French! If you like top-rated action, chilling intrigue, and characters that will make you shiver then you just have to read WAYNE'S DEAD by Christy. You will become a fan too (that is once you read this book!) So, what are you waiting for?"
5,I'm a Fan!,"I met this author when she was vacationing in Florida, so was curious as to what she had written. I purchased her second book first since I prefer thrillers, and I was not disappointed. The ending gave me goosebumps. The book is about a serial killer suffering from multiple personality disorder who preys on married, middle-aged attorneys. The reason why is easily understood. Christy writes with a quick pace, and the story moves fast. The characters are portrayed realistically, as is the dialogue. I like the Southern influence as well as setting she gave to the book. Now I'm going to order her first book - I'm a fan."
5,Enthralling Psychological Thriller!,"I became a fan of this author after reading her first book, ""Chasing Horses,"" which is a romantic comedy, and took advantage of her publisher's prepublication offer. I was surprised to find she had written in a totally different category with this book, her second, which is on the other end of the spectrum from comedy, proving that Ms. French has the ability to write about either ""light"" or ""dark"" issues and write well.The author's style is unique, and once again she has written a book which moves at a fast pace and kept me interested throughout - in fact, I read this one in one sitting. A fantastic book that lets the reader peek into the mind of serial killer suffering from multiple personality disorder, while keeping the reader guessing throughout as to who the killer actually is.I read where her agent compared the book to ""Basic Instinct."" Take it from me, this book is better!"
5,I'm a black woman and I thought this story was excellent!,"I don't know what the reader/reviewer from Harlem was thinking when she slammed this writer but I think it is she who is whacked and not this book! That being said, (geez!) Wayne's Dead by BESTSELLING AUTHOR CHRISTY FRENCH, is a terrific story that had me swiftly turning the pages of this book as fast as possible! (Ignore the insecure jerks/other/writers Ms. French they only wish they could writer a story line as terrific as you do!) For you it has become a reality, however, for them, their still dreaming! Now, hurry up and type out another bestseller for me and my reading group! We Love You!"
5,My Vote For The Book Of The Year!,"Wayne's Dead by Christy French gets my vote for ""Book Of The Year."" Very unique subject matter ""M.P.D."" A lot of writer's have tried to write the perfect murder mystery creating stories around muti-personalities, but none (in my opinion) have been able to get their point across as colorfully as this writer has. GREAT NOVEL!"
5,Both Chilling & Exciting!,"Wayne's Dead was both a chilling story as well as an exciting one. The characters ring true to life and the plot was thrilling. If you are a mystery reader like I am, then Wayne's Dead, by Christine French, is the book to order. Take my word for it you will not be disappointed!"
4,A Great CD!,"It was SO nice to see some new material from Berlin. The live cuts are great and lively and Terri Nunn never sounded better. The new material, some live and some recorded, ain't bad either. I really liked ""Steps"" and ""XGirl,"" written with Charlotte Caffey of the Go-Gos.Its nice to see that at least one 80s band has not disappeared and is still kicking a-s!"
4,Two Dollar Pistols Smokin',My only complaint is the album is too short! Tift Merritt's lilting country voice is the perfect complement to John Howie's gruffly penetrating retro sound.
4,Love it!,A great pairing. Reminds me a bit of Waylon Jenning's world weary vocals conjoined with Emmy Lou Harris. Favorite tracks are Counting the hours (it doesn't get much better than this!) and One Paper Kid.
4,Very Good for what it is.,"What is it? A comprehensinve list type book on the history of rock and roll. Not much depth, but ALL genres covered."
5,"Excellent, concise resource for the social history of rock","I have read and re-read this book many times since I first picked up the 3rd edition in 1996. I am a high school social studies teacher and I use this book as a resource constantly when I am teaching contempory history. Well thought out, concise yet complete, easily readable. I applaud Mr. Szatmary for his effort, the book has inspired me to research the sociolgical implications of rock and roll and not merely the ""pop history"" currently offered. Further, I was so inspired by this book that it prompted me to author a website dedicated to the sociology of rock and roll history."
3,White social history,"Ok, so there are about 3 chapters dealing with African American social life but they all are written from the viewpoint of a white person. Soul becomes white, Run DMC has white fans etc.It's not exactly clear what the author wants. A social history? Well, for 90% it's American history, with 10% dealing with England. Besides a racist the author also is only concerned with (white) anglo saxon culture and history. Nothing about German pop music, nothing about the influence of Bob Dylan in the former Soviet States, nothing about the Spice Girls, Backstreet Boys kind of pop sung by Asian singers selling Billions.There is no clear point, just a collection of paragraphes about artists. Btw, Radiohead, Sam Cooke, the entire Britpop scene of '94, country & western (very important socially in the American South, sorry but a few paragraphs on Garth brooks won't cut it). Too much to mention really.Oh well... (to quote another group not mentioned)"
1,errors,"In just glancing through this edition, I noticed these errors on page 52:1) Elvis' Army induction date as Jan. 20, 1958.It is my understanding that he was actually inducted around March 28, 1958.2) That a month after Elvis' induction came the tragedy Don McLean called ""the day the music died"".The plane crash that killed Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and Jape ""Big Bopper"" Richardson and their pilot Roger Peterson, occurred on Feb. 3, 1959, around 10 months after Elvis joined the US Army.3) That the Beechcraft Bonanza crashed near Fargo, North Dakota.The plane was enroute from Mason City, Iowa, to Fargo, but crashed in a farm field near Clear Lake & Mason City, IOWA, not long after takeoff."
1,Don't Buy,"this book is 2"" x 2"" - something not shared with purchaser. Bought for a gift and gave to Good Will."
2,fun size (not in a good way),"I thought it was gonna be a taaaad bigger.I can literally close my fist with this ""book"" inside.Taking ""pocket size"" to a whole other level... well done. Not."
1,Little Book of Etiquette,"I ordered The Little Book of Etiquette. I have received it. When it said ""little"" it literally meant ""little"" I all most threw it away it was soooooooooooooooo small. The book is about 2""x2"". Don't waste your money. Be cause it is soooooooooooooooo small I will not return it even though I should. Unhappy customer"
1,an unhappy customer,"i ordered for this book in july, this is august 26th and in have not received it.this is really not excellent customer service whereas my account has been debited.how then can you people expect me to review a product i have never received?"
3,Where's the meat?,"I find it sad, as a society we place so little value on the feelings and sensitivity of those around us. I was looking for a little more direction and specificity than this book offers. Pre-teens and teens have few good resources for instruction on manners and etiquette."
3,Good for Fine Dining,"I also wanted to ring in on this particular book. While it is small, don't be fooled. It offers a great deal of information on eating out, the do's and don'ts associated with putting your best foot forward, so to speak, and making a good impression when eating out. On the downside, etiquette and manners extend well beyond just the dining experience, so as a 'be all and end all' for all of your etiquette needs, I wouldn't recommend it. In fact, you can zip over to the elite manners website and just take a quick look to see that etiquette covers everything from the way you carry yourself, present yourself, introduce yourself, your choice of language, clothing, and mannerisms. With prom season upon us I just don't want anyone thinking that this book is about 'everything'. It is a VERY good book for eating out properly."
4,Helpful book before the meal,"The Little Book of Etiquette helps people to enjoy their meals with confidence. People judges others by how they eat. So, it's good to know about the etiquette and table manner. This book is very small, so it's not easy to flip the page, but it can fit in the pocket or purse. I wish the book was little bigger, so I gave them four stars."
1,Do Not Purchase This,"My husband and I purchased two pieces and used it once from Germany to Florida. The luggage itself looks nice and is conventional but one trip and the luggage came off the conveyer belt at the airport looking like it was beat up. The seams ripped on both pieces and the wheel completely broke off of one. The luggage had black marks on it and it just looked stained, worn and used. I would not recommend this piece and definitely not this color."
4,Easy to spot coming off the bagage claim,"28"" case is fashionable and big enough to pack a weeks worth of clothes and toiletries in. Four wheels to make it easy for you to haul around without breaking a swet. Went to LA and Costa Rica within a two week stretch and was able to locate my bag without a problem. It's Swiss Army, so it takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'!"
4,Cisco Networking Academy Program CCNA3 and 4 Companion Guide,Clear and concise. I couldn't have completed program without it.
4,A lot better............,"Well, if you are one of the poor souls half way through the CCNA course then you will be pleased to know that Cisco have greatly improved this 3/4 semester book compared to the 1/2 sem. book which was simply awful. This book's contents are is in the exact order of the online course, no jumping around... good questions, good CD with videos, flash cards and lab excercises. Know this book well and you could probably miss the class stuff altogether."
4,Sammy Cahn: All the Way,"I saw Jeff in concert in New York and was immediately hooked by his delivery of these timeless Cahn classics. He has a wonderful tenor voice that is well-suited to the songs on this disc, and that clearly coveys the emotions of the lyrics. I heartily recommend this cd to anyone who is a fan of cabaret, or of the music of Sammy Cahn."
5,Molybdenum,Delivered within estimated time. Great price and deal online than health food store. Liked that I could order easily without difficulty. I would reccommend to anyone looking for a great product like Molybdenum.
4,A good read,"In some ways, I really preferred this book to David Strauss' Chang and Eng. This one, told from Chang's perspective, was much more lyrical and better written. The descriptions of the Mekong Valley, the surreal world of Siam, and the familial love between Chang and Eng and their parents, wives and children were superbly drawn. Don't believe the reviews that say this is some sort of copy of Chang and Eng. It simply isn't true. The subject of 2 conjoined brothers who leave Siam and end up slaveowners, husbands and fathers certainly provides enough material for two novels, and many more than that as well. This book does a good job exploring the ontological aspects of the twins' conjoined state. They had one body, but did they have 2 souls? An interesting novel, well written and full of lucid observations about human nature."
3,"Remarkable, yet strangely lackluster in the end","I found this the strangest combination of a masterpiece and a flop. There is much beautiful, lyrical writing, and the historical details are vivid and compelling. But the choice to narrate in a prolix nineteenth-century ""literary"" style was a mistake, I think; it took away all empathy for the main character and his brother. In the end, though less virtuosic, Darin Strauss's version of the same story--Chang and Eng--is the more memorable and affecting novel."
3,Smaller than I expected,"I received the pillow fine, no problems. Looks better on screen though. My main gripe is that I expected it to be a little larger. I know it's just a decorative tapestry toss pillow, but gosh it is really very, very small."
5,Pillow,I gave it to my sons grandma and she was too happy to get it. It was the first thing she had with grandma on it. Perfect gift.
5,Great Store :),"I read some other reviews from this store and was hesitant at first. But I am really glad I bought from this shop. The item was really decently priced and the shipping wasn't too much either. I didn't expect to get my package for at least a week but it came within days. I would definitely buy from this shop again, simply because the package came much sooner than I expected."
4,Great stitching but the back looks cheap.,The backside is a cheap nylon or something that distracts from the overall great front side. However it is cute and a nice gift.And just as a sidenote- beware of opening the item. We ordered a lot a once and this arrived in a manilla envelope with no padding. So when you feel the package- you might think its a padded or bubble wrapped item. We took scissors to the side to open it and cut into the back fabric. Thank God it was just a half inch or so and I was able to mend it.
4,cute!,"My grandma is going to love this. It was a little smaller than I thought, but i didn't bother to really look at the measurements. It's super cute and any grandma would love this.."
5,"Works great, highly effective, Reommended by my Dr.","This product seems to work very well for me. My GI Dr. told me it would help reduce pain and it would help heal my insides and I think it has. I know when I stop taking it for a week or so last year, I don't feel as well, but when I went back on it,I felt much better. Since them I've stayed on it and I have no intention of going off it as I've also read a good deal about it on the Internet. Also it seems to help with a number of my health issues. If you are not familiar with it, I'd suggest you read about it on the Intent and then I think you'll feel as I do that it's an invaluable thing to take every day for those of us with health issues that Curcumin addresses."
4,Good product but caused heart burn for me,I took this product for a few months. Lately I had been experiencing heart burn and was wondering what was going on. Then I came across an article on advantages of curcumin. The article praised the supplement for its myriad advantages but cautioned that it may cause heart burn. Alarm bells rang for me and I stopped consuming the capsule. My heart burn stopped quickly.I used to take the whole turmeric herb without problems. I would go back to it instead of getting curcumin.
5,Noticable Difference,"I have noticed a decrease in the amount of joint pain since I began using this product. The glucosamine seemed to have stopped working so I was in need of a replacement. I found this product through an article in Natural News that spoke of its benefits. So far I am pleased, and at the huge cost reduction its a win win!"
3,Can't see results,"If it makes a difference, I didn't notice it. I wan't to see the results for my money. Won't try again."
3,its a supplement,"Don't know what to say, it is a supplement. It is easy to take, but can't say anything about health benefits either way as I haven't experimented with lab rates"
3,good product with side effects,I was thrilled to start taking this as turmeric is supposed to have anti-inflammatory qualities. It did seem to help my fibromylagia but it also caused major stomach upset. I had enough good results from it that I am going to try it again.
5,So Far So Good!,Jarrow's Products are AWESOME!! I'd recommend them to anyone looking at supplements.As for this specific one i'm new to taking it. I certainly haven't had any bad reactions to it so i'm assuming that it's benefiting my overall health but specifically the GI tract.
5,maybe placebo but it worked,"not sure if I got the placebo effect however, my back pain is gone and I feel less swollen in the morning."
5,"Skeptical at first, but feel it working after 3 weeks","I have Osteo and Rhematoid Arthritis and wanted to go the natural route to reduce the inflammation. In addition to high doses of fish oil, chondrointin, glucosamine and MSM, I added this to the mix and feel an even better benefit. I'll continue to use it."
3,"It seems a very good value, but I have learned that black pepper is needed for best effect.","It dsoesn't contain any black pepper or other substance to boost tumeric's effects. I take it only with food with pepper in it, otherwise I feel that I'm not getting any effect. I am currently looking for a product with another substance included to get the full effect."
1,No Difference,I've been taking this product for over a month now for cervical and back arthritis. I have noticed no change.
1,There are better...,"Cucurmin is poorly absorbed and should be taken with an ingredient to enhance absorption, ie piperine or phytosomes. It is puzzingly that there are so many positive reviews from a product that is not absorbed."
2,Didn't make a difference,I was disappointed with this product and stopped using after one bottle. Don't waste your money. Would not recommend to others.
4,Curcumin-95,"Good product, timely delivery but pricey, especially with the exorbitant shipping charges. I will reorder because the product is not available in local stores."
2,Very slow shippers,"This is a good product, but you have to wait until hell freezes over before you receive it. I think they send pony express."
2,Did not arrive on time,The primary reason I ordered this product is that it would be delivered as scheduled. It did not arrive and there appears to be now way to predict when it will.
4,brain saver,"havnt taken long enough to know if it works as ststed maybe will help long term, cant hurt anyway"
2,Not What I Expected,"I recieved it very scratched up, the shrink wrapping was of poor quality, pages inside didn't seem freshly new..Really disappointed. I was going to buy lots of these based on what I thought when I was going to recieve the first 1..Sadly, no1 cares."
5,Real Bayreuth Ring,"I have listened nearly all complete ""Ring"" recordings including several original Bayreuth recordings. Everytime I feel that this magnificent work can be heard correctly only from the acoustic of Bayreuth festspielhaus. This recording confirmed me once again. If you listened Solti's, you listened a ""fairy tale"", but If you listened Kna's, then you listened a ""Epic"". This is the difference. Sound quality? as far as I know, this recording is the best of all Kna's ring set including Music&Arts recordings and other Golden Melodram recordings!!!"
5,Next Generation Southern Rock,Cross Canadian Ragweed confirms the belief that the heart of Southern Rock is still beating. I wish mainstream country radio played this stuff more often. These guys ROCK!!
4,This Gravy is Delicious!!,"CCR does it again. Soul Gravy is like Donnie and Marie - Its a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll, and everything in between. But Unlike Donnie and Marie, this album doesn't suck. Fans of the band or lovers of outlaw country will especially like this masterful CD."
5,One of best cds ever!!!!,This cd is by far one of my most favorites!!!! Everyone that has listened to this cd has fell in love with it!!! Thank you CCR for this wonderful music!
5,Amazing,"This is the second greatest trance cd I have ever listened to, right behind Tranceport 1. The tracks are unbelievably well mixed, and puts you in a completely different state. Doran (who was a former stock broker!) is a god behind the turn tables. You will definately never regret buying this cd. My only complaint is that it starts off a little weak, but is negligible compared to the rest of the mix. Buy this now!"
3,Family Fireside Christmas,"It wasn't what I expected as there really wasn't anything written on Amazon to tell what it was. I was Christmas stories about the true meaning of Christmas, songs and a lovely fireplace scene. I actually liked it but gave it a three star rating because I think it could have been put together better."
4,Pleasant.,nice background to have around the house. love the fireplace setting the the crackling noises.
2,No real value,"Scripture ""Christmas Story"" reading is nice, however, graphics are cheap and amateurish. I would not recommend this DVD."
3,Implausible plot well-enough handled,"The writing in this book is okay (the first star). The plot is stupid to the point of unbelievable, but the author manages to make the parts involving the two women swapping places seem more or less plausible most of the time (the second star). The hero is unappealing for most of the book; the plot hinges on his choices, and most of the time, they are only thinly motivated. I kept thinking to myself ""Oh, yes, this is necessary so that the whole house-of-cards plot doesn't come tumbling down on page 75"".On the whole, it wasn't a huge waste of time, but I sure won't be rereading it or recommending it to anyone else. I only gave it the third star because I liked the cat."
3,Looks thicker in the picture,This headband looks a lot thicker in the picture than it really is. Our 11 year old son still likes it though.
4,Pretty Good Quality,"The headband looks good, I bought it for a friend for his halloween costume. It definitely looked good and did the part well. However for extended use I don't know how long it would last."
1,Poor quality,This is made of thin fabric and the stitching is visible on the lower portion of the fabric. Poor quality.
3,WHAT CAN I SAY?,IT IS WHAT IT IS . THE PRODUCT WAS AS DESCRIBED AND ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION. ITS RECOMMENDED FOR PURCHASE. STILL DONT KNOW WHAT IT SAYS THOUGH
2,"Kids only, not a quality item","This is a very cheap headband. Not cotton, not very long, and really just a kid's item.There is a 3ft. long cotton version at Amazon for almost the same price.Not recommended."
2,uncomfortable as anythng,"these are the worst boots ever! they are sooo uncomfortable,blisters everywhere! the heel is too high, the buckle make noise when you walk. waste of money!"
3,Better than I Thought It Would Be,"I had heard some bad reviews about this show, but as a Broadway fan with over 150 shows in my collection, decided to give it a chance. I might add that I am also a big Sherlock Holmes fan. Maybe that helps. I was then rather put off to see that even the liner notes did not have anything good to say about the show or score. So, with low expectations, I gave it a listen and was pleasantly surprised. The score has a certain charm and wit, with excellent performances, and that distinctive Broadway sound from the fiftie's and early sixties. I actually found myself humming along to a number of songs. Definitely worth a listen."
3,finally on cd!,"My mom used to listen to the LP of this soundtrack all the time, and I have been looking for it on CD for years. Some of the songs are boring, but there are a few catchy ones like ""Letters"" and ""Jewelry"" that I was dying to have. I wish I could have seen the actual theatrical production, that always makes the songs better, when you know what is going on while the people are singing!"
4,The First Broadway Show I Ever Saw,"Baker Street was the first Broadway show I saw as a child and I was totally taken with the magical atmosphere that was presented on stage. Fritz Weaver was perfect as Holmes, Inga Swenson was charming, and Peter Sallis was amusing as Watson. Plus Tommy Tune and Christopher Walken were in the chorus. The show had wonderful sets and costumes and puppets, to delight a young boy like me. Is this a great musical? Not really. But the songs work well within the show and the book was a lot of fun. I'm so glad this is available on CD because it really is a special show."
1,Dead in Ten Months / Burn Hazard / Faulty Timer,"I received my DeLonghi the first week of Oct 2008 and it died the first week of Aug 2009. It is very easy to burn yourself on the upper heating element while pulling something out of the unit because you can not pull the rack forward. The rack will fall down if you pull it forward at all, so you have to reach in with your hotpad to pull dishes out, which can result in burning your hand. The toast timer does not always move toward 'done', although it makes the noise as if it is working, resulting in burnt toast. We had to check every time we made toast to be sure the timer was actually moving. Also, I could not find a chicken small enough to fit the rotisserie. I love the color and look of the unit, but will not be buying another one."
3,Probably useful for others.,"Our daughter is not a fan of the bouncer. I haven't tried any others so I don't know if it is a bouncer hatred or just this particular one. Ours sort of makes a lot of noise when the vibration part is on which, again, not sure if it is supposed to or not as I've not tried others. But the noise is really distracting and loud. Not our favorite."
4,Great for infant,"This chair was perfect for my daughter around 1 to 2 months old. She is now 5 months and is too big for it. She is trying to sit upright and this bouncer really reclines with the child's weight. Therefore, she doesn't like being forced into a reclining position to play- she tries to sit up and cries."
5,LOVE THIS!,"This is my sons 3rd bouncy seat and the best! He loves to bounce and hit at the monkey and bird toys. It makes nature sounds and also plays music. Great settings, great quality and lots of fun for baby! Highly recommend!"
3,Good,This is nice because my son likes it. It's lightweight so that I can move it to wherever I need it. The bad part about this is that it takes 4 D cell batteries. I would've been nice if there was an ac adapter option so that I didn't have to change out the batteries so much.
4,Rainforest Bouncer,"Appears to be a good quality item. The sounds, lights and music work good. We haven't had the baby yet so I can't describe how it holds the baby or the baby's interaction with it. So far I am happy with the product."
2,not secure enough,Setting this up was easy... too easy. It wobbles and the connections are very insecure. The music is annoying and shorts out. The toys hang way too low and touch my newborn. The rings that attach to the monkey are not secure enough for children to not pull off. I took it back.
5,excellent!,"this was the 2nd bouncer we bought for our grandaughter (now 4mo.) and she loves it! its very interactive and she kicks, plays, and grabs at the monkey, bird, etc.i highly reccomend it to any new parents as money well spent"
5,Wish it was mine!,"One of my best friends owns this bouncer and I own a kick N play (handed down) and a leap frog bouncer. However, all of my (3) children have prefered the Rainforest bouncer at her house. I wish I had bought this. It keeps them occupied for longer and I've even watched both her children and mine fall asleep in it!"
2,OK,"This bouncy seat is OK, but.....if I had to do it over, I would have bought one of the infant rocker bouncer seats that convert into a toddler rocker. What I didn't like about this seat is that it wasn't as curved and comfy as other seats. It was kind of reclined back at a weird angle. The toy bar was hard for my baby to reach and other than watching the pretty waterfall lights, there just wasn't much to it. The toys were kind of bland and didn't do much. I did like the pretty colors and decor, but it just didn't work out for me. When he turned 8 months, I sold it and bought the rocker/bouncy seat that converts to a toddler chair."
2,Cute but several problems....,"This bouncer is cute and seemed nice when I got it. However, it was not very practical. When my baby was still very small his legs hit the plastic vibrating piece. Also, the little animals on the toybar made loud clicky noises when they moved. Not very relaxing. The hanging toys also laid on top of his legs. On the box it shows the baby nestled farther up so this didn't happen, but anytime I put a baby in this they slid down further and the toys hung on them and they kicked the plastic piece. I returned this, not very comfy, even when he was still little."
2,Not Great,"Get the Itsy Bitsy Spider bouncer! We have both and by far the spider one is loved much more. It is simpler, but our almost 6 month old likes to kick the hanging spiders and make the bouncer bounce and the Rainforest bouncer doesn't seem to work for kicking."
4,Great but...,"My son loves his bouncer. He doesn't actually bounce by himself yet, he's only 4 months old, but he loves to kick with his feet and grab the toys. The toys are a little low but it doesn't bother us.The only thing I don't like is that I can't turn off the music and leave the lights on. It turns off for maybe 5 minutes, then it comes on by itself.My son doesn't like the music/forest sounds. He starts crying 5 min after listening to them. He loves the lights though.I tried adjusting the different music settings to totally off with no luck.We had a problem with the moving frogs. Every time they moved up and down they make this loud, continuous clicking sound. I had to take the unit apart and disable them. My son never paid attention to the frogs anyway.All in all it's a good toy. It really keeps my little one entertained for about 30-45 minutes at a time. He's so quiet sometimes that I forget he's in there."
4,Must-have baby item,"I gave this as a gift, and having one myself, I knew it was the ideal baby gift. This thing made showering possible for me for the first 7 months of my little guy's life. He loved the vibration, and when he got a little older the toy bar with the music, sounds and lights entertained him. I know it is a huge hit with the family I sent it to. Highly recommend this seat for new parents!"
4,Rainforest Bouncer,"My son loved the rainforest theme.This bouncer was okay, but my son outgrew it VERY quickly.I felt like this bouncer couldn't support his weight,not like I thought it should.When ever I put him in, he was practically laying down.In the end, my son was only able to uses this for about 3 months."
3,Great bouncer! Just be careful,"My baby loves sitting in this chair! He gets a little bored of the toy attachment but we take the seat all over the house. He watches me cook and do dishes, entertains himself while I shower and watches me do odd jobs around the house. It's very stable and almost impossible to tip over. Just make sure you buckle baby in because all they have to do to fall out is arch their backs. Also, this thing will trip you on your face like nobody's business so be very careful when walking past it while holding your little one. The legs stick out farther than you think!Finally, be careful when attaching the toy bar while your baby is sitting in the seat. I always watch out for his hands but still managed to pinch my boy's little fingers in it once. His screaming broke my heart! ( he was ok)."
1,Broke after only a few months,"Had this for maybe 2 months before it stopped vibrating. checked the batteries, put fresh in still didn't work. then the part that goes over the chair with the rainforrest animals shorted out. started randomly blinking and the animals would no longer move up and down. it basically turned into something I just strapped my son in and that was it. maybe it was just mine - but seems like it could use some improvement."
3,Rainforest Bouncer,"The bouncer is cute and colorful. Downside, the seat is not very cozy. My son loves it so if he's happy then I'm happy."
4,"i like it, hopefully my son will",I got this because my nephew loved it! I think it's the best bouncer I've seen. My son is only 6 weeks and soo far it seems that he's too young to really pay attention to much on the bouncer. I'm just hoping he will like it as much as I do pretty soon!
3,Good except sound bar,"Just bought this bouncer and put it togather. The seat seems soft and well padded which I like, and over all looks super cute. Only problem is the sound bar plays music but none of the moving parts are working. Called fisher price, they were really nice and are sending me a new sound bar. Hopefully this will fix the problem, since baby is not here yet this is not a huge problem for me. Just hope it works!"
4,Rainforest Bouncer,"Nice quality. Baby likes it. Got scared at first with the vibrations, but now loves it. Puts him right to sleep. Would have been nice if there were some sort of head support like they have in car seats. Don't use the activity feature as much because it is a bit too close and claustrophobic like. Will use more as he gets a little older."
3,Too small,I purchased this bouncer for my 7 month old. He is small for his age. When I put him in the bouncer his knees went past the monkey and toucan toys and almost touched waterfall. The arch is MUCH LOWER to the seat then shown in the picture. I had to return it.
3,Meh,Every baby is different ... I was hoping my daughter would love it as much as the other reviewers did. -It was a no go for her ...she could sit in the boucer for about 10 minutes but after that she was restless. -It is very cute and a well made bouncer but just not the right one for us.
4,Our little one loved it!,"This was a must have for us...my daughter loved it and still does! She would play, nap, or just hang out and watch me work when she was in it. She's out grown it, but will still sit in front of it and play with the hanging toys. I'm only giving it 4 stars though because of the frog making that horrible clicking sound. However, my husband took it apart and disabled it, no problems now!"
5,Great for Baby!!,"I have had this bouncer since day one. My son is now 7 months old and still uses it. Out of all the baby gear we have bought, this is by far the most used. I did have a problem with the frog clicking but I simply called Fisher-Price and they sent me a redesigned replacement bar at no cost to me. That fixed the problem.I like how the toy bar comes off, this way he can interact with me while I do other chores around the house (i.e. dishes) and it keeps him from crawling off when I cannot easily attend to him. The music is very pleasant and fun to listen to...I did not find it to be loud at all. My son really enjoys this and gets excited playing with the monkey and parrot, which do not seem low for him. He is 19lbs now and has no difficulty in the bouncer. I do own other pieces from Rainforest collection and find them to be good products as well."
5,Fabulous Customer Service!,"My son absolutely loves his Rainforest Bouncer, unfortunately, when I put him in it this morning and turned on the toy bar it started making a terrible clicking noise. I called Fisher-Price customer service and couldn't have been more pleased. The lady I spoke with was very nice and in less than 10 minutes had a new toy bar on its way to me free of charge."
4,I bought this today,"But, there are 2 things I don't like. One being that the toys hanging from the bar are too low. My sons knees hit it and he is only 6 weeks old. Second being that the continuous play songs, don't actually continually play. It actually pauses for about 1-2 minutes. My son will fall asleep to the music, then it pauses and starts up again, waking him. i do love the vibration feature, which is the main reason i bought it. All in all, it is worth it."
5,Magic chair,"Our newborn is now 7 weeks old and has been using this seat, day and night, from the first week of his life - he loves it! The vibration relaxes him and he falls to sleep as soon as we put him in it. He doesn't love the toy bar yet, but it is removable which is nice. The chair is magic and made our lives so much easier!"
2,Toy Bar Broke Right Away,"My baby loved this, but the toy bar has a frog that moves and it broke right away. The gears got messed up or something and it began to make this loud clicking and grinding sound. This upset my baby and also upset me since I payed so much for this. I have since read other reviews that say theirs did this same thing, so it must be a flaw with the whole line of these and not just mine."
4,Our go to in the first three months.,"We're 99.9% overjoyed with this swing, and the volume issue mentioned by other reviewers is our only complaint about this swing. We often used this to get our daughter to sleep and would have liked the option of turning the volume down or off once she had drifted off.Apart from that, this swing was our go to baby item in the first three months of our daughter's life."
1,Useless - and someone please tell me how to change the batteries in the top!,"I don't get this thing. I can't figure out how to change the batteries in the top bar, so all it does is crackle. My daughter is 3 months old and can't reach to hit the toys with her hands, and can't kick it because the bar is so low and the toys hang by her knees. Are they supposed to knee the toy?? The music won't play because of what I believe is the battery issue. So, since I can change the batteries for the vibrate function, all it does is vibrate and she gets sick of it within 2 minutes."
3,"Good overall, but water leaks","Used this for many months with my second child a couple of years ago. Overall, the product is good. It did the job. However, the plastic front and pieces are very hard and would bump my daughter on them sometimes when putting her in and out of it. Very cumbersome to take the parts on and off for going in and out of it multiple times. The water leaked out of the rainforest plastic piece and ended up throwing away. Now that I am expecting the next child, I am choosing a different bouncer seat this time around."
1,Rainforest dud,"I purchased this product, thinking by now Fisher Price had fixed the broken toy bar.After one day it would only work on child play mode.....not on continuous play.I am so disappointed in Fisher Price. This same complaint has been going on since 2007.I would buy another bouncer,I do not recommend this one.I should have paid more attention to other complaints on the same problem.DO NOT BUY!!!!"
3,Not as good as I thought to be,"We received this as a gift. The music is bad, compared with tiny love mobile and baby einstein toys we own. The toys attached on the bouncer is quite minimal, my daughter get bored in a couple of minutes playing it. We did not own other bouncer, so no comparison with other model."
3,MY SONS FOOT GOT STUCK,"My 4 month old son loves this bouncer, he actully sleeps in this at night. This was my fav. thing intell about 30 min ago when i herd my son screaming and went in to find his foot stuck in the toy bird on the toy bar. His poor foot is black and blue.as much as he loved it i think i will have to stop useing it now."
3,Not for the chunky babies,My husband and I are over addicted to the rain forrest theme for our first boy so naturally we had to have the bouncer! It's adorable but not for our chunky son! He rather big for his age wich I admite has made this bouncer not useable for him. It sits in th corrner of our living room. If we put him in the bouncer he sags all the way back and I'm scared to death he will roll out of it. Just be careful if you have a chunky babie before purchasing this item!
2,Made my daughter cry,This toy was useless to us in the first couple months because I had better places for her to sleep and had a swing that she liked better. She has never been a fan of the vibration. What most concerns me is that this toy has made her cry more than once. She starts to get all excited about the lights and music and waves her hands about. Then her hand strikes the hanging toys which are quite sturdy and she cries.So we sent it back.It's really cute and might be good for calm babies but maybe not so good for excitable babies.
1,HATE this thing,"first of all my son hates it. secondly, there is some kind of short circuit or something and the lights and music never stay on. absolutely hate this baby item!"
5,I love this bouncer!!!,After my mother helped me by changing the batteries on my ocean wonders bouncer I had to have a new bouncer since she unscrewed the wrong side and took apart the motor!!! Needless to say she is not getting near my new bouncer! I chose the rainforest model due to the fact it is adorable and I have always leaned towards fisher price products. I am not disappointed in my selection - my daughter LOVES this bouncer! She could have cared less about the toy bar on the ocean wonders one but this one keeps her attention and she loves it! I have not had any issues with it yet and it seems to continue to hold her attention after a month.
1,DO NOT BUY,"My baby really loved this, however the seat broke went he was in it. I was hoping I received a faulty product so I exchanged it for another, with the same results. The green plastic parts used to hold to seat together are cheap and don't hold. The screw that is suppose to go in to the cheap green part also strips out the part making it impossible to fix. If they made the seat frame one piece, all the problems I had with it would be solved. However until then....don't buy this its a waste of your money."
3,Baby Loves This But Toy Bar Broke Immediately,"We just received this bouncer today for our 10 week old. This is the third bouncer we have tried and this is the only one that the baby has liked. The light-up waterfall captures her attention and the hanging toys are low enough that she can grab and play with them. She smiles and laughs in the seat. She also enjoys the strong vibration. I am giving this bouncer only three stars because like many other reviewers said, the toy bar started malfunctioning almost immediately. The two animals at the top of the toy bar which should go up and down stopped moving within 5 minutes of use. Luckily, Amazon makes returns incredibly easy and are sending a replacement now."
5,Very Enchanting,My baby loves this bouncer. She will sit in it for up to 30 minutes and swat at the monkey. The toys hang just at hand level for a 0-3 month old and it keeps her attention for quite a while. Plus the seat is the perfect height to prop in front of the tv for her to watch her baby einstein with the bar removed. She likes the seat because she doesn't like to lay all the way down and the vibrations help her sleep when she's restless.
5,Great bouncer!,"We initially recieved the papasan bouncer for our son and well, it doesn't really bounce or have much to look at. So we got this bouncer and it is a BIG hit with our little man."
3,Gotta have a bouncy seat!,"We received this as a gift and although we still have yet to buy the 4D batteries to make it work, the seat itself is great. I like how you can remove the waterfall thing and it can just be a seat. She actually slept it in her first week of life because it's elevated and she had reflux. I can type online and bounce it with my foot. I think everyone should have a bouncy seat for their baby."
4,Fun for Baby,"This bouncy is great. My son is now 8 weeks old and has been enjoying his bouncy since his 1st week of life.The cover is soft & comfy. The music and noise levels are great, Lights are amazing to baby.The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars is that the vibration is LOUD! Very loud so loud in fact you cant hear the music over the rattling if the seat. When we put more weight/pressure on the seat the noise lessens so Im thinking that when Baby weighs more it wont be so loud."
2,Regret buying this thing..,"I thought my baby would be mesmerized and fascinated by the lighted musical waterfall.. but I think she's rather intimidated by it and all the stimulation. The waterfall is not as cool as I expected and the music or sounds weren't all that impressive. The hanging toys which are made of hard plastic, indeed hang too low so every time she moves her legs her knees activate it, which seems to agitate her. The seat is pretty and uses good fabric but overall this item is not really worth paying its price.I wish I had just bought a used or cheaper bouncer."
5,Very Entertaining,The babies love the seat although they get a little uncomfortable if they have been there a long time. The vibration is very soothing and all the music and visual stimulation is great. I'd buy it again!
2,Scares Baby,"This worked great for a couple months. Then the monkey that moves up and down started making a loud clicking noise. The gears must be slipping. My poor baby gets really excited to kick the parrot to make the monkey move, then gets scared at the loud clicking/popping noise and starts crying. Really sad."
2,BE CAREFUL,"I BOUGHT THIS BOUNCER WHEN MY SON WAS SIX MONTHS, HE IS SEVEN AND A HALF NOW AND HIS FOOT WAS TRAPED IN THE BIRD'S SWING TWICE, AND THE SECOND TIME IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FREE HIS FOOT AND INJURED IT. THAT WAS REALLY SCARY FOR ME. SO PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN YOUR CHILD IS OLD ENOUGH TO PLAY WITH HIS FEET. IT COULD BE A GOOD BOUNCER FOR BABIES UNDER FIVE OR SIX MONTHS"
2,WHAT happened to the packaging?!?!,"This was a gift that was purchased for a friend's baby shower and the box the bouncer came in was completely destroyed. Unacceptable. Then, they tried to tape it all up to cover the ripped box-so now the gift looks even more hideous. Absolutely annoyed."
5,Great for infants,"My little boy loved this. He used this for several months as an infant. He was fascinated with everything from the music to the lights, bright colors, and everything that's dangling. He especially found the little dangling monkey interesting and kept turning it around. The bouncing motion also helped him relax."
5,The best on the market,"I read other people reviews before I made my choice for my newborn baby Girl. The best buy, she loves it, and all my family loves this product because we can do something while she is so comfortable there."
5,LIFESAVER!!!,"this bouncer is incredible! the lit-up waterfall and dancing animals keep my babys attention for a long time, plus she loves the dangling bird and monkey she can swing and play with. the seat also vibrates and the bouncer makes jungle noises. i bought another bouncer before this one, but this was one of the best investments i ever made. well worth the small price!!"
5,Pride Eagle,"I bought this Eagle for my son for Christmas. It is nicely made, and sturdy. The fur is very soft. There was more than enough stuffing to fill it completely with a little left over. Most of all, my son loves it. He loves birds and is very happy with his new eagle."
2,Bible Challenge,This product is nothing as I thought. The quality is very poor and the DVD gets stuck on questions where you cannot move on....
3,"OK, but a little disappointing...","When I got this book, I guess I was expecting a bit more theology and less ""devotional"" material. The information is solid and theologically sound, but the authors seem to flit from topic to topic. I wanted more at the end of each chapter, but then we were on to a new topic.If you have the right mindset, it's a good book. If you're looking for something more academic or in-depth, this probably isn't what you're after."
1,Not authentic or even good,"This book does not have authentic Vietnamese recipes as suggested by the title of the book. The biggest slap in the face is that the recipe for Vietnamese baguette (banh mi) does not even turn out properly. Many readers had tried the Vietnamese baguette (banh mi) recipe in this book, and it did not turn out well for any of them. No point in wasting your money buying this book."
1,Looking for Vietnamese Cookbook (Good),"I am looking for a good vietnamese cookbook to impress my husband. Since I'm jewish I don't know anything about this style of cooking, but am ready to learn. However, he tells me that the only people who eat dog meat in vietnam are drunken men who do not invite their wives to go eat with them. Whatever may be the case, I don't think I'll be buying this cookbook."
3,Not as impressed,"I haven't been as impressed with this cookbook, and I've tried at least 2-3 recipes. I do, however, enjoy the background she gives with the recipes and her family's history."
5,10 yo Loves These Books,"My 10 year old got the original ""Bathroom Reader"" - and requested more. He pick this one and the ""scary"" one out all by himself and was so excited when they came. He really enjoys these books. (And likes sharing his quirky trivia!)"
1,Very Disappointing,"Robbin has been hanging out with Michael McDonald way too much. Supernatural (which unfortunately collides with Santana's new album with the same title) is, imho, a big disappointment for Robbin Ford fans. I understand he wanted to stretch out a bit to the mainstream, but this stuff is fluff.The only good tunes on this CD are the last two songs, which ironically are the most bluesy.This is the only Robbin Ford album that I would return... and I am a huge fan."
2,Unfortunately...,"...this CD, The Authorized Bootleg, Tiger Walk were disappointing to me. I have been a fan ever since Robben Ford was with the Yellowjackets (the YELLOW ALBUM, a must have!!!!!) but it seems lately that he is either changing styles (again!) or is totally uninspired. Too bad!"
2,Not his best,This cd was a major disappointment for me.It really doesnt showcase his playing..and gets lost at times.I find myself wondering what he was shooting for when putting this cd together.Its not really blues blues...nor is it really jazz jazz...which I love both of those Robben's styles.I found it boring. So many other of his cds to choose from..I would skip this one though
3,"Robben does his ""departure"" album","Robben, I'll buy your work even if you only do six bar solos on 1/4 of the songs. You've got blues elegance that few are gifted with. Supernatural is the album that you deserve to make for 2 reasons: You've got nothing to prove and why not get a hit and reward yourself financially? Bonnie Raitt did and the music didn't suffer.I'd like to get my teenager to appreciate it and tell her friends, but it falls between her tastes and mine."
3,"frustratingly short but adds ""color"" for my students","This is a collection of VERY short videos (mostly 10-30 seconds long) that are so short they frustrate me to death--but my middle-school students were riveted. They were excited to see the ""Edison"" tag introducing each clip and LOVED the clip of the horse trainers. I used this AFTER we studied the Spanish-American War so they had frames of reference for the ships and locations---but don't get too excited about the clips. They're just so.short. Side benefit of showing these clips: It jumped a GREAT discussion on the advance of technology in the last 100 years and led into a great brainstorming about what the future holds. Bottom line: history geeks like me will like it but not love it---teachers will get limited use from it. Students will enjoy the brief exposure to early film."
4,The Experiencing God Study Bible,"I love the wide margins on this Bible, and that is the main reason that I purchased it. I am glad that the Bible is printed with a larger font, but I wish that the print was darker and more ""popping"". I also prefer an indention for each Bible verse, rather than the paragraph form that the Blackaby Bible uses."
2,Plodding and ultimately unsatisfying,"I began reading this book with high hopes, for the idea of the plot (a woman leaving her home for unkown reasons, and being determined to possibly have some sort of mental problem) seemed very interesting. Unfortunately, the longer I read the book, the more boring it became. The action (if you could call it that) moved at a snail's pace, and the underlying ""mystery"", the deaths of several young women, was capable of very easy solution.When the plot finally came to an end, and the suspected murderer was unmasked, it was just ""ho hum, I knew it all along"". Rather than end the book on the note of discovery, the author had to attach a very sappy ending, which made a poor book even worse. I definitely do not recommend this book, but I will say that my wife enjoyed it very much, and were she a reviewer, would give it 5 stars. Perhaps it's just a woman's thing, and I ""didn't get it""."
5,Nice shoe,"This shoe is deceiving because of the heel height. Once I broke them in,they were very comfortable."
1,You will be disappointed,"I purchased this CD with high hopes, because all of the songs on this CD are good songs. However, the arrangements presented here will leave you cold.The first two songs on the album (""The Look of Love"" and ""Raindrops Keep Falling..."") are the instrumental versions of the song and not the versions that you might expect. As you get deeper into the album you realize none of the songs are the hit versions that you remembered and enjoyed.This is essentially the greatest hits of Bacharach the way you won't remember them. I listened for 1/2 an hour trying to find something that would make the purchase worthwhile. I found none.If you like Burt Bacharach and want to listen to the songs as you remember the, it looks like you'll have to try ""The Look Of Love: The Burt Bacharach Collection "", which unfortunately is 4 times the price."
2,Folds to the weight of the bags.,I loved the concept of a push to lock belt. I found out with all of the tools I have that this one is flimsy. I have leather bags and when I put my belt on the belt folds over. The fold now is permanent which makes it uncomfortable to wear since it makes the belt half of the thickness.I realized if you have leather bags get a leather belt because it'll be sturdier and not have this problem and if you want to just keep your pants up buy this belt.After this I purchased the DEWALT DG5198 2-Inch Heavy-duty Leather Belt which is perfect for heavy tool bags. It is wide sturdy comfortable and there are two loops for the belt which doesn't put a strain on the loops. I seriously recommend this one. The only very small letdown for me is that it didn't come in a natural leather color.
2,Tool Belt,"It lasted about 6 months. The webbing started to come apart.The buckle is durable, the belt is not."
1,Lousy quality,I bought two of these not even three months ago. Lost the red in both right away. The last one I lost the red and had printed only six papers. I wouldn't waste money on these.
2,printer ink,Very blah colors. Nothing compared to the original colors. Would never purchase this product from this company again. Can't even get the red to print on one of the cartridges. Junk and garbage are comparable
3,worked okay for a while,Worked okay for about a month and then dried out.....never had a cartridge last only a month.I do not print that much. They have always lasted at least three or four months
3,Just.. ok.,"It looks good and with two 150 watt bulbs it is BRIGHT. However, per other users, the control (especially with the remote) is annoying: do I tap once, twice, hold down the button??? Dunno. Anyhow, my remote stopped working after a year (no, not even with new batteries) so I am trying to figure out how to get a replacement - I recently e-mailed the company. The remote is useful as I keep this lamp behind my couch in the corner of the room and I do not have an easy way to get it on a switch in my apartment."
2,Cheap construction and appearance,"Ehhhh. I thought this looked like a quality lamp. Heck, Target sells it for $100 so I figured I couldn't go wrong when it went on sale here for $54. Wrong wrong wrong. It had to be returned immediately. it was cheap looking and lightweight. No way would I spend $50 on this (let alone $100) if I had been able to really see/feel it ahead of time. Save your money."
1,Very disapointed,"Item does not work, manually or remotely. I am a senior citizen with health problems and could not take it apart & ship it back. My money is just gone for nothing. Will now have to have someone put it out for trash pickup."
5,lets sexareeno,"this album is one of the best rock and roll albums i've heard in along time.nice bass and keyboard work.great to dance to.les sexareenos are a crazy band and they're live performance is great,seen em in hawaii.low low low!!!"
5,Congratultions on your new book Steve! Excellent!,"Steve - Thank you for sharing your broad based knowledge with the rest of the world! Your book is a work of art: 1) The photos are fabulous and 2) The information contained within will help newcomers to the sport or to the Riviera Maya understand the various cave systems, fragility and beauty of the environment. I too have had the honor and priveledge of diving with you and can share first hand that you practice what you teach re: conservation, careful/sensitive diving in the fragile environment so others may experience the beauty and pristine nature of many of the systems you write about. The accident analysis and review of safe cave diving practices are a huge bonus. Thank you for signing my copy while I was in the Yucatan last month! It is a treasure! This book should become a bestseller!"
5,To go where few men have gone before!,"I have dove with Steve In the Cenotes of Mexico. I find it such a fascinating country that I have been to this area 4 times and Mexico in general, many times. I had no intention of buying this book, but a friend wanted it so I bought it for him. He never got it! I was completely spellbound by the pictures and stories and did not put the book down for several hours. It is well written and quite factual and will impel many divers to see this part of the world that only a few people are privileged to see. This is not a book that you will ever want to part with."
2,Big head? Wrong sweat band!!!,"Okay, to be fair, never worn a sweat band before in my life. I am in Karate with my 12 year son, and we both have long hair. Thought the sweat band would keep the hair out of our eyes while we were doing our cardio. I am sure it would have worked fine, if it weren't for our big heads. These bands were just TOO tight, they bit into my skin, and made my head hurt. So, if you have been called ""big head"" or ""lollipop"" any time during your childhood, DON'T buy this band... :)"
1,This book is awful!,This book is based on the following fallacy: calculation is more important than insight! The authors teach discrete mathematics as an exercise in mindless logical manipulation. They actually encourage the student to trust manipulation over insight and recommend facility with calculation as more important than real understanding. The authors are great researchers but they are followers of a pedagogically destructive ideology that is due to Dijkstra. A reader can use this book to learn to calculate with logical formulas or to wrap fried fish but she cannot use it to learn discrete mathematics.
2,Why there are no answers to the questions in the book?,"Those who wrote positve stuff about this book, please tell me why nobody even mentioned that the authors did not give the answers to all the excises in the book? I just can not believe this, am I missing something here? Is this a math book? What am I supposed to do now with those questions?"
5,THE BIG BUD TAKES THE PRIZE,"WODERFUL product, does what it claims. Makes beautiful huge flowers. Thanks Amazon for making it so easy to buy my Hydro grow necessities."
5,Wiggly Wiggly World - next WiggleMania,"Just when I thought the Teletubby phase would never end we discovered the Wiggles. Now my 2 1/2 year old can't get enough of Anthony, Murray, Jeff and Greg. The DVDs are great - no rewinding. We enjoy the CDs even more since we can take them in the car and sing-a-long together to his favorite songs (all of them). After viewing the DVD/Tapes a few times my son learned the moves and listens to the CDs in his room and dances along. This is fun for the entire family. Wiggly Wiggly World adds lots of local charm to the fun songs written for the gang.Hope you enjoy Wiggly Wiggly World as much as we did."
4,Not your traditional Wiggles music,"My 2 year old likes this CD although it does feature numerous other artists on it. We always have to listen to The Wiggles in the car. We have many Wiggles CDs and listen to a different one each day we are in the car. If you have a Wiggles fan, this CD is worth a try."
4,Fun and Long-lasting,All my kids love to dance and sing along to this CD - it's very well done and enjoyable to listen to. The guest musicians are a nice bonus. This is a great CD!
1,Kui Lee never sounded like this in person,"I was really disapponted with this CD. The description that comes with the CD indicates that a ""jazzist"" named Mike Berniker produced the album. Unfortunately, what resulted is a jazzy, and snappy series of songs that do not do justice to the Kui Lee who used to sing with a slower and deeply emotional delivery. During the time that Kui Lee was singing at Queens Surf I was living in the Waikiki Aquarium and I used to listen to his music almost every night. It was beautiful and haunting and this CD does not begin to do justice to the Kui Lee I remember."
5,He deserved better and he deserved to be archived better BUT..,"This five star review isn't a comment on how Kui Lee performed live, or on the quality of this particular recording session. It's one of the few opportunities to expose his work via CD and keep it alive. Kui's gone, Don Ho is gone, Elvis is gone... Kui deserves to be heard today in any form. His lyrics are as heart wrenching today as ever."
5,Great Follow up to Broke Down,I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes good old grassroots folk/country music. Slaid Cleaves is a great song writer and performer and it shows through in his recordings. Honestly if you haven't listened to this CD you are truely missing something.
2,I don't believe a word of it,"I purchased this disc after having read the glowing reviews and because of Slaid Cleaves' association with artists I admire. Unfortunately, I find WISHBONE utterly boring and unlistenable. Every note, word, syllable and emotion is so perfectly placed that it resembles the work of a gifted graduate student who has assimilated the works of the masters without really having anything of his own to say. The overwhelming effort to convey sincerity and passion seems processed and canned. I greatly prefer his UNSUNG disc."
3,GOOD MATERIAL BAD PRODUCTION,"Slaid Cleaves has shown that he is an absolute lyrical wizard.Unfortunately Gurf Morilx's production on this CD is awful and almost succeeds at ruining this CD completely.While not in the same league as his previous outstanding release ""Broke Down"" its still Slaid and the songwriting is solid (again not on a par with Broke Down)Im not unhappy that I purchased this CD. its just a shame that Slaid like so many others has fallen prey to slick glitzy overproduction at the hands of Morlix"
2,A little too country,"As much of a fan as i am of Slaid Cleaves, i didnt enjoy Wishbones. Slaid's relocation to Texas is strating to seep further into his music. The folk sounds of Lifes Other Side and No Angel Knows have been left behind for a more ""twangy"" sound.Slaid, come back to Maine!!"
2,Disappointed,After the acclaim this album has drawn I was looking very forward to hearing it. I was disappointed in it and found it impossible to get into. I listened to it through 5 times trying to find a groove with it but never did.
2,Items are HUGE and they charge for exchanges,"I ordered two shrugs. They came in a timely fashion, however the M/L are enormous. When I inquired about an exchange for the small I was told that I would have to pay to ship them back and pay 5.00 each to EXCHANGE the item. Even if they have the greatest products--there are too many online stores to pay more money for poor customer service policies. I will make due with the larger shrugs. Buyer BEWARE."
1,I RECIEVED THE WRONG ORDER!,YOUR ADD SPECIFICALLY SAID IT WAS FOR A MELITTA MILL AND BREW 10 CUP THAT IS THE COFFEE MAKER WITH A BUILT IN GRINDER AND BASKET FILTER THAT IS WHAT I ORDERED BUT I WAS SENT A12 PAPER FILTER MAKER THAT I DO NOT WANT! I HAVE CONTACTED THE SELLER AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD SEND A UPS RETURN LABEL FOR THE PACKAGE AND I HAVE NOT RECIEVED IT! IF I DO NOT GET THE PROPER ORDER ASAP I WILL ADVISE MY CREDIT CARD TO DISPUTE ANY CHARGES1
2,Replaced mine,"Whether you like a pickup or not is extremely subjective. Besides, a pickup that works marvelously in one guitar may not do so well in another. In short, choosing a pickup is basically a crap shoot.Well, I purchased a 59 neck for my two humbucker Strat. It and I just never got along. I found it muddy, unclear, and inarticulate. This was a bit of surprise since my guitar leans toward bright and percussive. Another surprise, given my preference for distorted tones, I found the 59 too hot.In any event, because I absolutely LOVE the Tom Anderson HN2+ I have in the bridge I figured I would go Anderson again. Bingo! The Anderson H1 is fabulous and just what the doctor ordered.Again, when it comes to pickups, your mileage may vary."
3,Save your money Composite Tubular Flask,About all I can say is it does work. Not well but it does work. The valve leaks small amounts of powder. It is dificult to fill the spout. You cannot change the spout. If I could start over I would spend a little more and get a brass unit with a gate valve and removable spout for different volume charges. I would return this unit but it is not worth my time and effort. It is better than pouring directly from the powder can.
2,Two Broke!,"I bought this truck for my son's second birthday. The first one arrived unable to operate the side loading feature right away. I ordered a second truck from another company. It worked for about 4 hours, then broke. I replaced batteries but no luck! It's so sad to dissapoint a 2 year old like this. He loved the side loading lever and how the garbage cans actually had wheels on them (though their tops come off and break over and over) unlike the Bruder trucks garbage cans."
4,cheap and easy to use,"i bought this printer to copy pc game pdf files , i have a lot of flight simulators with big manuals, i got about 200 pages copyed with the black cartage no.17 .........the printer is ok...for that use ...i wouldnt recomend it for photo's and such."
4,"No USB cable, No black ink cartridge","I bought this for my son and although it was new it came without a USB cable and only the color cartridge was included. It was printed right on the box that a black cartridge needed to be purchased separately as well as the USB cable however no where in Amazons description are these things mentioned. It would have been nice to know this as I could have had them ready to use when the printer got here. As it is I'll have to wait a day or so to get to the store to buy these extras. Fine job on shipping, printer arrived in good condition and will be fine for a kid who has a habit of burning them upon, but Amazon is falling down on the job with the descriptions."
3,illegal sample??,"In the track ""Gilentium"" you can hear a sample of Darth Vadar's breathing apparatus ""fuuuuuuuuuu - paaaaaaaahh""!!!Somehow I doubt they were given legal rights from Lucas Entertainment to use this as a sample :/"
3,Disappointed,The prior reviews built up expecations not met by the actual music. I like the other guys better. I gave this album to my daughter who will listen to anything.
4,a great imitation,"This CD is a thorougly enjoyable hybrid of mystical Gregorian chant and sensual electronic rhythms. Many previous reviews have compared Magna Canta with Enigma, which is certainly justified. However, the comparison is really only applicable to Enigma's first album (MCMXC A.D.). That being said, Magna Canta's style is strikingly similar to what you will find on MCMXC. In fact, If I heard the songs Ritmo and Alleluia (two of the songs on ""Enchanted Spirits"") without knowing the artist, I would swear that Enigma created them.So as you can see, Magna Canta is not really breaking any new ground here. However, the music on this album is very high quality. It's one of the few CD's where I don't mind listening to the whole thing over and over. If you like music that is spiritual, mysterious, sensuous and timeless, this CD is for you. Thanks to Magna Canta for picking up where Enigma left off."
5,WOAH!,"People always ask me "" what kind of music do u like?"" Well honestly I'm a jazz fan. When I first heard this it wasn't what I expected when the title read ""Group Improvisation...That's Music!"" But interesting nonetheless. If you are into hard core or rock I would recomend this album. The album also has a little little bit of softness in its first track- Lower Egypt. The poem read by Dan Higgs is quite the truth and I like it. This Album is deffinitly recomendable. Infact, I say buy it!"
5,Pee - Your - Pants Funny!,"This hidden camera show is absolutely hilarious! Kennedy's unique comedy and varying characters are fantastic- my favorite is the driving instructor and all the dental surgery characters. You'll even see the original B-Rad, the rapper from the hard streets of Malibu who went on to make ""Malibu's Most Wanted."""
4,"An elaborate ""Candid Camera.""","It takes a great deal of nerve to take the old ""Candid Camera"" idea of filming unsuspecting people tricked by pranks, plaster your name on the name of the show, and then take that very old idea and call it an ""experiment."" The only thing new here is how elaborate and well-planned the pranks now are. Some of these hoaxes must have taken months to plot and plan. The result is some pretty funny stuff. There is also a very lame trick of having Kennedy pretend to have jaw surgery and needing to have his mouth wired open. This pathetic stunt is repeated several times throughout the first season - which hints that they were running out of ideas even then. Still, some great, hilarious bits. But it isn't an experiment. And it didn't start with Jamie Kennedy. Or Candid Camera (the idea was done on radio way back in the 1940's)."
1,What a waste of time,"This has got to be one of the worst shows of it's kind ever produced. How did this guy ever manage to get financing for this show? It looks like he had plenty of money to finance the show, but the thing was, in the end, the pay offs where pathetic.That sketch he does where he's a fat women with a talk show.. whats funny about it? He pretends to be a women, fools the audience, says something stupid then takes the mask off... if the joke is finding out shes a he, then hardy har-har (sarcastic laugh) but it would be funny to actually do a prank, or some kind of a joke, not do something for real then all of a sudden reveal it's him. There is nothing funny about that at all.This guy has no talent."
5,Be Prepared to laugh!,"For under $35.00, the purchase of this 3 dvd disc set is just the fail-proof ""experiment"" everyone should take. If you like surprise comedy, you'll like this. It's funny, fresh and the setups are quite believable. Oh and I must say, with his arsenal of characters, Jamie is quite the ""master of disguise"". Characters like Brad Gluckman (the rapper from Malibu,Virginia Ham (the Oprah-like talk-show host)and ""Judge Jamie"" are hysterical. Can't wait for the next seasons to be released on DVD, I just hope Jamie doesn't do an ""experiment"" on me!!"
5,A MUST!!!!!!!!!,I've been hooked on Jamie since the first time I saw his show. I watch it every week but I still got the set to keep for when friends who haven't seen them come over. One important question........ Where's Season 2?????
4,A Classic Aviation History,"I have always been a nostalgic fan of the PT - series of Stearman planes. This book is a wealth of information and well worth the buy for any ""Stearman"" fan."
4,Radiation Shielding,"I have read 'Radiation Shielding' from cover to cover,and I must say that Shultis hit the nail on the head for almost every question I wanted answered.This book was very helpful in that it provided great detail for shielding procedures, step by step,unlike many other books I read.The only problem I found with this textbook is that the binding on it is weak,and comes off easily. Plus the pages have a strong smell of sulfur(fart) .This was probably due to a problem with the manufacture of the paper,but don't worry,it's not that bad.Thumbs up.Great book."
5,My husband can see what's he's doing!,"The internet is great. My husband commented he was having issues seeing up close while metal working and welding. Bingo, a quick internet search and I ordered him a pair of magnifier safety glasses. I can see! I can see! I can see! he exclaimed as he came from the garage."
5,Great Horror soundtrack!!!,This Soundtrack is a must! Any fan of Re-Animator will love this CDit is very enjoyable and suspenseful. It has all of the original classic score from the movie. Even if you haven't seen the movie you'll love this soundtrack.
2,Ho-hum sci-fi,"This book tricked me into reading it. It starts out promising, but after 300 pages of unimaginative character development, it leaves the reader without an ending. I felt cheated. Nowhere on the book jacket did it state that it is the beginning of a series. I recommend the ""Well of Souls"" over this series."
3,"Dripping with philosophy, ending unimpressive.","Jack L Chalker did wonders with the Well World Saga. His witty cynicisim and infinite imagination do not end there. In ""Deamons at Rainbow Bridge"" he takes on another set of philisophical themes. However, dealing not with racial differences as in the Well saga nor with crime and punishment as in Lords of the Diamond Chalker takes a good hard look at Governement, it's form, It's ideaology and it's implications. Three interplanetary empires, the capitolist Exchange, the Naziesque Mychol and the theocratic Miztlapan (Excuse me if I misspelled that) wrestle for control of the known galaxy. Told in multiple points of view with an thourough examination from the perspectives of each of the empires, Chalker is oddly holistic though this work does retain his typical anti-religion undertones. One warning, this book is clearly the first in a series. The tale only begins here. Do not pick this book up expecting a complete telling, expect a saga from page one."
2,Mediocre book,"This book is an introduction to what I gather is a longer series of books.Unfortunately, the book spends its time introducing us to three separate groups of characters, none of them particularly interesting. They don't actually arrive at Rainbow Bridge until the very end, whereupon the story ends with nothing resolved.This wouldn't be a problem if the story and/or characters were interesting enough to make me care about what happened to them in the future... but such was not the case."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Tripartite chase.Humanity has split into three factions, with three differing philosophies of existence. This first novel in this trilogy is an obvious and not that great set-up for the rest of the series as each particular group is introduced via a set-up character, and things only get a bit more interesting towards the end, with the discovery of the necessity of going to find otu what the Demons are up to.The end of the book is not well placed and a bit annoying.2.5 out of 5"
3,Undecided,I found this book to be fairly dis-jointed. The plot that was finally presented at the very end seemed like it could be interesting. Maybe Chalker pulls things together better later in this series.
4,Memory Course on a CD,"Dominic O'Brien, the several-time world memory champion shares his techniques for developing an effective memory. I saw him perform some amazing memory skills at a book signing, such as memorizing dozens of random numbers and an entire page of a news-paper! Quantum Memory Power provides practical applications and exercises to test and strengthen your memory abilities. O'Brien covers some of his favorite techniques, such as the Journey Method, Mnemonics, The Story Method of recall and much more. Rick Sheridan, ..."
2,a messed opportunity,"While the language on these discs can be identified, with close scrutiny as a form of English, It is extremely difficult to understand, especially if one's hearing is a bit below par.I think customers should be warned if language used is not English or non standard English. The speaker is also unskilled, often swallowing the end of his sentences. Very frustrating trying to catch this all, and the lists that he asks you to memorize are impossible to understand. Mispronounced words can be figured out if in a sentence, but not on a stand alone basis. I have never been exposed to this form of English before. It was unnecessarily difficult and, in my opinion, a different reader should have been used."
2,"something over and over,","I gat this couse,I told is going to be Good ,but it' was just ok.the firth Cd.talk about momorize 8 stations .Good the second Cd. talk about memorize 10 stations.is ok.hey third as well and so on.up to the 8 cds' come on."
4,really does work,"these were ordered for my husband who listened and gained a great deal from them, he could not remember very much and after listening he remembers even my phone number...he hasn't done that in 13 years.... great product and I would recommend to all."
5,A Great Read,"One of my all time favorite books, for it brought me back to yester years when life was simpler but love the same."
5,childhood memory,"When I was a child in the 1940s my mother received O, the Brave Music as a Book-of-the-Month Club selection. Later on I read it, and read it, and read it. I totally identified with Ruan. Now I see that I can order a used copy, which I will do right now.Carolyn Morrow Long"
2,disappointed,"Not very challenging at all. The same questions are repeated too many times, regardless of the level of difficulty. Not worth the money I paid."
3,Decent,"I like this album. I wanted it mostly for the songs ""Sitting On A Cloud"" and ""Never Stop Being '67"". The other tracks are pretty good as well. Word of advice, though, don't waste over a hundred dollars buying it from online sellers. You can download it from Napster for ten dollars!"
1,terrible,"terrible containers and lids. leaked/didn't seal, seeped through the paper, couldn't freeze b/c of air that got in-- lids literally fell off with the slightest pressure. returned them."
4,EVERY CHARACTER WAS PATHETIC,"The movie was quirky. Tracy Orbison (what's in a name?) is obese. People take advantage of him because he desires companionship and can't get it. He has a mom who wants her wall flower daughter to get married and have children, but when she gets a boy friend (Tracy's acting coach who plays the field) she openly prays to God to help her promiscuous daughter. Why does every Indie film have to have wall flowers? Tracy has been working 11 years as a stock boy, then gets promoted to assistant manager only to find out everyone is already and assistant manager, it is just a feel good title, like Walmart Associate. The action is slow, but steady. The plot is simple with no real surprises, at times boring. The movie is humorous, but not laugh out loud funny. Acting superb."
4,ok but... didn't really start until half way,it was an ok book.. but i'll probably lose interest by the time the next book comes out the start of the book is .. not as good as most starts but great book overall
5,The weather as an integral character,Many novels have used variations on extreme weather to challenge and motivate characters. Some have used weather to uphold weak characterizations. J.V. Jones has made the weather of the clanholds a living breathing character with apparant motive and direction. this is a enjoyable twist on the usual sword and magic fantasy.
1,Am I Reading the Same Book???,"Am I reading the same book that is referred to by all these rave reviews? To put it succinctly (which the author knows not) this book is slowwwww..... If you like at least a moderate amount of action to help keep the story vibrant, then look elsewhere. These other reviewers fooled me into buying this snoozer. I figured out that this must be some kind of conspiracy in which the author's family members are generating these faux positive ratings & reviews. Don't fall for it like I did!!"
4,Wonderful and Chillin Read !,"This is the first book I read from J.V. Jones and I must say that it has been a wonderful start,the book is great and she excels in describing the settings and places throughout the story and developing the characters as well. The cliffhanging effect in the end will surely drive me mad untill I get my hands in the next installment ! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars was that the book could deal with more action, as to keep the pace a bit faster and steady instead of rising slowly as it seemed to me. Nevertheless this is an amazing read with it's frozen and dark settings and if you have the chance, go and buy it as fast as you can !"
3,Vivid. Depressingly vivid.,"This book's author is a master of her craft with words. She can sculpt a landscape so real you shiver with the characters, and you will do a lot of shivering. Ms. Jones also dispenses with the coddling that most other authors are guilty of giving their protagonists and proceeds with crushing their very souls. Murphy's law reigns supreme, everything bad that can possibly happen does. Usually in reads such as this an author will put a scattering of hope throughout the prose to lift up a readers spirit, but hope is for wimps. The scene where women and children are mowed down relentlessly was a nice touch.To sum up, there is nothing wrong with the storytelling, but the story left me feeling drained and crushed my faith in humanity. Only read if you want your world to be cloudy, grey and bitterly cold."
3,Uneven,"Very uneven, and takes to much time with the story until the abrupt and hurried ending. The protagonists are pretty weak and feels strangely disconnected. The bad guys however are much more interesting. The novel left me with a lot of questions though. So many in fact, that I probably will read the next in the series sometime."
4,Good Read!,"One of those books that builds a bit slow, but ends up with you unable to put it down for wanting to know what happens next. Character development follows a gradual path, but is richer for it. Looking forward to reading the entire series!"
3,"great characters, lackluster storyline","Jones creates a great fantasy world, but falls short in her storyline. What great characters she produces, she brings them down to the typical evil is coming, must fight it. As well, although the novel is a trilogy, there is little to no lead in into the next novel. Decent read,but not the best."
3,"Well-written, yet a bit slow...","...it is by far a bad book and if you have read and enjoyed Jones' Book of Words Trilogy, then you will also enjoy this, since it is written in the same universe, called the Known Lands.It has a good, but not new story, we have seen it before, but like in BOW, we hear a lot of the intrigues that goes on in the world, among the clans.What I miss in this book is what I loved in BOW, the dynamic way of writing, I loved that you could follow a lot of different characters in one single chapter...and I loved Tavalisk and Maybor, so obvious I miss them and could wish that they were featured in the new trilogy.But one thing I will say...there is a big surprise for those who loved BOW, for you will meet one whom you have missed... I won't say anymore...Enjoy it."
3,decent reading with some notable flaws,"The book wasn't very satisfying...It was readable, but the embarrassingly shallow charactors made it torture to continue and I will never pick up another Jones book ever again.Mace Blackhail is easily the most irritating charactor I've ever read in a book. There are similar charactors all over fantasy, but by the time Jones has gotten around to it...the very idea of a ""Mace"" charactor is extremly frustrating. I also agree with an earlier reviewer that Clan Blackhail are a bunch of idiots to believe the drivel that Mace tells them...Everything he says is just ""Aye, aye"" and nodding agreement. Raina not saying she was raped for whatever reason was also annoying.Unless you like reading something with a plot a 8 year old could predict, I would stay away from it..."
4,Praise for the magnificent J.V. Jones,"J.V. has outdone herself. I was slightly disappointed by the Barbed Coil after the spectacular Book of Words Trilogy, now J.V. comes back with a fist of thunder. A Cavern of Black ice is full of intrigue, likeable characters, and a great plot. If you read her books avidly and haven't read this yet, I promise you, the end will shock you so much you'll need a minute to recover!"
5,Anxiously awaiting the second book,"J.V. Jones does it again. Once you get past the first three set up chapters, you get sucked right into the story. She is a great one for interweaving story lines and characters, keeping everything very consistant. Loved it! (can't you tell?). Now, if she would only hurry up with the second book......."
4,This book subconsciously affected my physiology.,"While reading this novel, which is set in snow and ice, I felt the cold. I spent the entire time next to the heater wondering why it was so cold. A novel has to be good when you subconsciously start to feel the weather. This novel is worth reading for its ability to totally submerge you in its intricate storyline."
5,A very good book you can fall into,"This is a great book that is very well written with numerous indepth plots that fit together very nicely. Once you read the first 20 pages you are hooked on the book. The characters are great--you really get to love and know the main characters very well and the villians, like Mace Blackhail, are really set up well so you hate them easily and hate them more for getting away with their crimes. And they are so well created so that they fit into the book perfectly. I think that the world the book is set in is just great. With the all the clans and then the other more advanced cities around them, its just set up very well. And the dreaded Sull, which we see little of, just add a little fear effect needed. All they geography and peoples make the world fit together and you can really get in touch with it all. A very well written book, I await the next in the series."
4,Waiting impatiently for a sequel....,"This was a very well-written book, and I loved it. I think that the violence could have been toned down a little, but, overall, this story was a great, fresh idea in the realm of fantasy that has been moving slowly lately."
5,Epic Fantasy With Balls,"This is a truly wonderful story. It has a tension and a sense of drama that most lack, and it executes and creates these with ease. It's sequel is at least as good as well.This is the strength of Epic fantasy, the longer it runs, if done right, the more invested in the world and it's characters we are. The longer it runs the stronger our imagination takes it and runs with it.Well written. Unique. Tense. Good read."
3,This book isn't finished,Story and plot was mediocre. Entire book felt intentionally peiced together. I have only read the first book in the series to date. Book 2 I am reading now because I have to know how the story ends. I have a feeling I will be reading the full series. Don't read this book if you can't see it through to the end of the series.
4,A Cavern of Black Ice.,"This is the fourth book that I have read from Jones. Like all the others she creates characters that feel real. I could not put this book down, I had to keep reading to find out what happened next. I cna't wait until the next in the series is released."
4,Old book republished,Such a joy to have this book as I am a rabid genealogist and have many direct ancestors involved with this church.
1,THAT IS NOT THE SONG!!!!!!!,THAT MORTAL COIL CRAP IS NOT EVEN LOSE TO THE SONG!!!!!!! IT DOSNT SOUND THE SAME AT ALL!!!!! UGH! I THOUGHT I FOUND IT BUT NOOOOO IT IS NOT AS GOOD!!!!!!!!!!
1,THE SONG ON THE TRAILER,"Hello all. I've spent the last 6 hours trying to find the song that is on the trailer, as well as the website, and it's called ""song to the Siren"" and it is by This Mortal Coil. Hope this helps you all! =)"
4,Creepy score for a creepy movie,"This review refers to the score for 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', as opposed to the album.Relatively little-known Steve Jablonsky has done an AWESOME job with the score for the remake of the 1974 horror classic, 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. The score creeped me out so bad I got chills down my spine just from listening to it. It always seemed to hint that something unpleasant was going to happen soon - whether that meant Kemper getting whacked by Leatherface's sledgehammer, Erin's wild run through the woods at night with Leatherface & his chainsaw close behind, or Andy's panic-stricken run through the backyard of the Hewitt house, steps ahead of the loudly-buzzing chainsaw. Jablonsky created a central theme - probably Leatherface's - using low brass, bassoon, and French horn to give the movie the sinister, creepy tone that runs through the movie. It's heard several times in the movie, which was why I bought the score. DO NOT MISS IT!"
3,Trailer Song,the opening song to the trailer and the theme for the film. is called Song to the Siren by Moneypenny. it is not on the soundtrack and it is not a single. seems they left off the best song. which is a drag i know. but again we get cheated by missing out on having a beautiful version of a classic song.it is not the chemical brothers. thats a completely different song. its not This Mortal Coil. their version is much more gospel sounding. and Tim Buckly did not sing this version. and there are several several other cover versions. but the one for this film is by Moneypenny.so stop trying to find it. cause its not anywhere on the net. and its not on any album.so hope this helps. bad news i know. but maybe one day it will be released on a format.
4,that elusive song from the trailer.....,"the listing for the full version of the original song is....Did I Dream (Song to the Siren) by Lost WitnessNow that the mystery is over......""Look what your brother did to the doooorrrrr!!!!!"" (The Cook in TCM(1974)"
3,Song to the siren,"I recognized this song from Lost Highway by David Lynch. The song isn't on the Lost Highway soundtrack either, but looking at IMDB.com i found the following:""Song To the Siren""Written by Larry Beckett and Tim BuckleyCourtesy Third Story Music Inc. (BMI)Performed by This Mortal Coil feat. Elizabeth Fraser and Robin Guthrie (Cocteau Twins)Courtesy of 4 A.D. by arrangement with Warner Special Products"
3,TRAILER SONG: clarification once and for all...,"The song on the trailer was FASHIONED after the version by This Mortal Coil but was actually sung by my sister Renée from the band Moneypenny. It performed just by her (not the whole band) and only the portion heard on the trailer was recorded.Also, yes, there is indeed a band called ""Moneypenny."" If you type ""Moneypenny"" in the search box under ""Popular Music"" on Amazon, their cd's will appear--""She's All The Rage"" and ""Apply The Labels.""Hopefully this will clear things up--thanks!"
3,This Mortal Coil,"Yes, indeed. ""Song to the Siren"", the song that has caused so much ranting and confusion is a song sung by ""This Mortal Coil"" in their 1984 album ""It'll end in tears"". Someone in this thread correctly states that the singer of this song is also Cocteau Twins' lead singer, who happens to be Elizabeth Fraser. However, Fraser did not sing with DCD (Dead Can Dance), and there is an error in that statement. DCD's lead singer is Lisa Gerard, who has a similarly bewitching and overwhelming voice. I have almost all of these two groups' albums, so if you need any more info, I will be glad to give it out. I do hope the movie is as good as this particular song."
1,Trailer song,"O.K. to clear things up, the trailer song IS This Mortal Coil- ""Song to the Siren"". It's on their CD ""It'll End in Tears"". The album came out in 1984. ""Song to the Siren"" is contributed to the Album by the lead singer of ""The Cocteau Twins"", and as far as I know is NOT on any of their (The Cocteau Twins) albums. As a side note she also used to be in the band Dead can Dance. I don't know anything about the song being done by Moneypenny, I am pretty sure that it is just a rumor. Hope this is helpful."
4,The song at the end of the trailer,"I saw the trailer plenty of times, just because I loved the song that plays at the ending of the trailer. Can anyone tell me the title of the instrumental piece that plays at the end of the theatrical trailer?Thanks a lot..."
1,Song to the Siren,"Actually, while wandering around the web about a year ago, I came across a site by Casharel, Or Cashavel ..its a french beauty company-they make perfumes, etc. They had this song on a cd compilation they had put togeather celebrating unknown female artists. So it can be found on the web, it just takes alot of poking around. I cant for the life of me recall who their version was by, though."
5,ENGAGING GIFT FOR ENGAGEMENTS,"What a great book for couples, or those thinking of walking down the aisle. I read MARRIAGE CONFIDENTIAL first, then I made sure my fiance did so, too. It brought a lot of issues to the forefront, and I'm glad we've talked these through BEFORE the wedding.The Browns bring up issues in a fun, funny, or insightful way. In fact, consider it as an engagement gift. Any bride and groomwill be glad you did.Mollie"
3,Good? Yes ... Great? Ehhhhh,"I recently had the great pleasure of seeing Mr. Barrett in ""Chicago"" on Broadway, and was very impressed by his vocal talents. When I saw he had an album out I couldn't buy it fast enough but with all honesty - he's better on stage than in a studio. On some selections his vibratt gets a little out of control and he looses a great deal of his warmth that I remembered from his performance. While he is no doubt one of the finest up and coming performers on Broadway, he still has a little to learn about studio singing. The album, as a collection of great Kander and Ebb songs is wonderful, and at times he really hits the nail on the head. I certainly look forward to both his next stage performance and album, but can't give this album a whole hearted thumbs up."
5,I thought I'd never find this!,"I'm a grape-motif fanatic...and have lived for a long, long time on old Oneida silverware and hand-me-downs. Never did I think I'd be able to EASILY afford this beautiful set of stainless with a raised grape pattern! They are long, sturdy, shiny and heavy...unbelievable purchase! I bought two sets of 8...I know I'll have these for a lifetime! Best purchase I've made in years!!!"
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered this set of flatware because it was a really good price and it received good reviews. I was very disappointed when I received the set. The first thing that I noticed was that it really wasn't all that heavy. Plus, and nobody bothered mentioning this, but the design is only on one side. The bottom side of each piece of flatware is just plain and completely unadorned. I guess it doesn't really matter if you're just looking at it in your place setting, but once you pick it up, I felt like it looked kind of cheap. All that being said, if you just want a decent set of flatware for everyday use, the design is unique (if you really like grape motifs)and the price is appropriate for what you get. Just don't expect this to be great deal."
1,what ever to the other reviews....,"out of all the indie i like and all the music i like to listen to this by far has to be the absolute worst album i ever downloaded off of my emusic account, all i have to say is that this band is horrible in every aspect i listened to the whole cd and thought wow music is going straight in the dumps these days but hey what do i know most people never even know what i am talking about music wise, maybe i just have a rather refined music taste where i just chunk out all the bad and hope for the great ones and this isn't great at all...."
5,Just what the doctor ordered,The powder form of this probiotic is excellent for people who cannot take the standard capsule form. The flavor is fine and the product dissolves completely. It does the job in just a few days. Continuing to take it daily is great for catching disruptions before they start.
4,five lac,This product seems to have worked for me. It has a plesant taste and is easy to take. Individual pouches can be carried with me and I can take them where ever I am throughout the day.
3,FIVE LAC,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT; I'VE USED THE THREE LAC BEFORE AND FELT GOOD RESULTS SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY THIS FOR GREATER RESULTS. IT WAS VERY SWEET INDICATING A HIGH SWEETENER CONTENT, AND I HAVE FELT NO SIGNIFICANT RESULTS."
5,glad I found this.,"I had been tired and run down for a long time before I found this stuff. Since I have been taking it, my life has improved in many ways, and I am not tired anymore. My Wife takes it too, and it has helped her to quit drinking. I Can't say enough about how great it is that she doesn't even feel the urge to drink anymore. We have tried to tell others about fivelac, but they are often skeptical. It is certainly their loss. I don't know how I would have made it through the last few months without fivelac. Thank you to the makers of fivelac!"
5,Fits our needs,My husband cannot take anything by mouth and has a feeding tube. Chemotherapy has played havoc with his digestive system. This probiotic in powder form is like an answer to a prayer. Good price for large supply. Very effective.
2,Hit or Miss,"This product is really a hit or miss. It worked alright for me the first time I bought it about a year ago, and then when I tried it again it didn't work. Everybody's body is different but if you have Candida Overgrowth my advice is to do a lot of research and try different products out there to see if they will work for you because it is a very nasty disease and won't go away on its own or just with the candida diet..."
2,ineffective and makes you smell awful,"This product produces a nasty die-off smell which is like a yeasty body odor. It made me smell really bad and feel strange, and I didn't notice any boosted immunity or feelings of increased wellness. I suffer from candidasis and bad allergies and sensitivities. I will continue with the rest of the product I have left until I run out, and if I start to feel better, I will return and change this review."
4,Good Bacteria,"I got the product on time and I loved the taste and the packets they came, so it's measured out for you. I don't know what it did for putting the good bacteria back into the intestine. I only take one box, which I probably needed to take more, not sure."
3,three-lac is better,in my opinion three-lac works better and costs less. not sure why. i have ordered and used and recommended three-lac. i will not buy this fivelac again.
3,FYI: Contains Lactose (among other things),"I was taking this probiotic for about a year before I even realized it had lactose in it so I wanted to write a review that explicitly points this out. I gave it three stars because while it did help me, it also hurt me. I bought it to fight candida, which I'm pretty sure it did because I felt better. However, I'm also lactose intolerant and was wondering why it felt like I hit a wall with this stuff. Well, now I know and hopefully others do too."
5,good stuff,"I used ThreeLac before, and I like it. I think this is even better. Best probiotic I've tried...and I've tried many. Well worth the price for the amount you get."
5,Fresh!,"I have had horrible digestion problems since I was 14. A wide variety of symptoms that I can't even beging to list. I tried everything. Only thing that a doctor could recommend was a parasite cleanse. It worked, but it never fully went away, and after not using the parasite cleanse for 2 days or longer it would be full on attack again. I got threelac after doing some research, and now i'm trying fivelac, hopefully this is more potent, and hits some of the spots of candida the threelac couldnt. Ordered it on monday night, shipped out by tuesday, it's thursday today and it was on my front porch."
3,good product with some side effects,"I think this product has certainly helped me with my digestion and possibly Candida. I have all the symptoms of candida, oral thrush, occasional foggy head/dizziness, constantly tired etc..I've been using one packet a day for the past 3 1/2 weeks. I stuck to a strict candida diet for the first week however I noticed in the second week that I was losing weight. I am a 28 yr old male. I started out at 172 lbs. I am in good shape and workout 3-4 days a week. I am now down to 165 lbs. Now this may be a good side effect for some people however I do not want to drop any weight. I may attribute this to diet however in the last two weeks I went back to eating almost as I was before taking the product. I may have to stop taking it. Has this happened to anyone else?"
5,a classic,"I will say that there are slow points in the 1st cd but she makes them seam.......i don't know, worthwhile. CD2 is truly an amazing piece of work.IMHO I think it's a classic. By far her best work to date. She just knows how to bring you up with her fearless mixing. She really hits you and just takes you away. Simply beautiful. I've always liked sandra but she was never a favorite of mine. This puts her in the top spot, without a doubt.I'm truly amazed with her. I'll see you in Miami. :)"
2,good to fall asleep too,"I thought Sandra took it down a few notches witht this cd.I would consider her a great dj, but I dont agree with the ""progresive"" tracks that she played in this cd.On both cds I only got into to 2 songs and thats it. This cd is really slow. I played it driving from Vegas to Phoenix and I almost wrecked cause I was falling asleep.Sandra live is much better. Sandra on other cds is much better.Sandra on this cd is much worse. I hope she makes it up on her next cd."
2,This CD is too melodic,"I have other Sandra Collins CDs and can honestly say I dislike this one the most. It seems like Oakenfold is Sandra Collin's puppeteer. This Cd is way too melodic for what Sandra Collins has done before. This CD is pretty typical of what ""Perfecto Presents"" releases: too melodic without enough spunk. I have other Perfecto Presents releases and have been disappointed with them since only a few tracks are really worth my while on said CDs. Hopefully PP will add a little more energy to their releases."
4,confused...,"first off, this is good. really good. i've listened to far too much sandra at this point..and these two cds, from front to back, tell a story. THIS, folks, is progressive trance.however....this mix is NOTHING at ALL like the tour she did for it....which, in my opinion, was better. so i guess fingers crossed for a mix like that from miss collins eventually..she's finally on her game."
5,Good but not for the beginning trance fan!,"I picked up a copy of Sandra Collin's latest hoping that it would be alot like her ""Tranceport 3""cd which came out a few years ago.This is a great 2-cd set but is not for beginners.I've been listening to trance ever since 99'.Sandra spins a different kind of trance than most dj's,and you have to let the cd play all the way through without skipping a track to really enjoy the mix.This girl has incredible mixing skills,showing no errors and taking you into dreamland!This is the dark style of progressive trance...a style that is used by such dj's as Christopher Lawrence and other European dj's.You have to be in the right mood,but when you are this cd will really space you out and make you feel out of this world.Check this dj out if you really like trance because you wont be dissapointed!!!"
2,Surprised by this DVD (in a kinda bad way),"I was expecting something quite a bit different, and felt a bit ripped off. Be that as it may, I own it now, and will try and make the best of it with my class. It really should be retitled as, ""Some Archival Footage of Presidents"" or something more accurate. History of US presidents implies depth and comprehensiveness that isn't present here."
1,It's not at all what I expected,I fell asleep on this movie. I love Katt Williams. This movie was not good at all.
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!!,"THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE, KATT WILLIAMS AND MASTER P ARE WRONG FOR MAKING THIS MOVIE. IM A FAN OF LOW BUDGET MOVIE, BUT THIS MOVIE WAS JUST DUMB. IT WAS NOT FUNNY AT ALL. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A FUNNY MOVIE ABOUT INTERNET DATING, LOOK FOR THE DVD CHAT ROOM, ITS WAY MORE FUNNIER THAN THIS MOVIE."
1,Horrendus,"Like so many comics before him, Katt Williams shows fantastic promise while on the stage, while showing little talent as an actor. On top of this, the movie feels so low-budget that you feel as if you could potentially get your home video camera and make a film with a few friends that could be sold in stores nationwide. Imagine how you would have felt about Clerks if you never laughed once. That's Internet Dating."
2,Approach with caution,Interner Dating was a very low budget movie. The movie was confusing and it didnt flow correctly. His stand up's are way better. You will laugh not at the movie but the poor quality.
1,Your Time is Worth more than this movie,"Do not watch this movie under any circumstances, I like Kat Williams, but this may possibly be the worse movie ever made."
2,So Bad It Was Funny,"The plot of this movie did not make sense in the least, the acting was horrible, and the low budget showed in every possible way. However, I laughed out loud throughout the film, and often because of how bad the movie was. This IS a terrible film, but if you are a fan of movies that are so awful that they actually become funny, I think you might enjoy this one. I wouldn't recommend purchasing it, though."
3,Not a blockbuster,One of those camcorder type movies Cant Believe kat williams did this movie does not comb his hair lol in movie
1,Currently using this dvd as a coaster,"The worst movie I have seen in a long time. I am gonna give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe the cast and crew did not watch the movie before they released it. There is no way they watched it and thought or said ""this is gonna be a hit"". Keep searching and spend your money on another movie."
2,just ok,"it was low budget and very corny, but it had a couple of laughs here and there. Master P still doing the same ole same type of film that he has pretty much always done. another low budget film, but it's a bargin."
2,Continuing on my search...,"Currently I own two PS books. One by Scott Kelby (Photoshop for digital photographers), and the other one is this one. I must say they are two extremes. The one from Scott is too simple, and he doesn't go into why you're doing something. It's more like a tips and tricks books. This book on the other hand is too much information scattered around in different chapters. I find it very confusing and difficult to read especially when the author makes unrelated examples to throw you off. I spent much time reading the chapter about writing curves but I still could not understand the correct way to write my own rather than follow his. Overall, I think this book is very un-organized which makes finding a specific topic difficult."
5,Wow can't stop reading this book,Love the specialized content. Love the writing style. Can't stop reading...Hope more books like these are published.
4,Not for me,"As a pro photographer I found this book heavy going and irrlevant as it is CYMK based and photographers use RGB.I've tried to ""dip"" into this book every now and then in the hope of re-discovering things I missed on my first read but I've found it useless.A good photoshop book (I like Scott Kelby) will give you all you need in color correction.Is the only way of getting good color by converting first to CMYK then back to RPG? Sounds nonsense to me.I picked up on a few things put it did not solve my photoshop color problems. A waste of time for me.Anybody want my copy?"
1,Find Color Correction Advice Somewhere Else.,"I thought I would write a review because I did not want you to spend your money buying this book. It is rather out of date, which is not bad in itself, but with the ongoing, strident egoism and my way or the highway attitude: I would advise you to look elsewhere.I could go into particulars but enough said. Look elsewhere for more up to date, user friendly advice."
5,Best book on Color Correction on the market,"This book has the most in-depth and real-world explanations and guides to getting the most from a color image, bar none. It's not always the easiest to follow, as it expects the user to have a basic familiarity with the product, and some of the concepts are difficult to grasp, but no other book I've seen (I own over 50 Photoshop books, and have read at least another 100) gives as thorough a foundation to permit correcting colors and salvaging faded images.It is NOT a general-purpose guide to Photoshop: it concentrates solely on color and tonal correction and enhancement. To my mind, that is a benefit, but if you're looking for a general Photoshop handbook, this is not the one to use.For photographers, pre-press operators and such, this is THE book to master."
5,A must-have text,"Not bedside reading, but an essential companion for anyone seriously involved with producing better images from digital cameras."
