3,Parker pen refill,"Parker Pen refills are hard to find in the local department stores. I am appreciative that they are available on-line. But, they are way too expensive."
1,ugh,What a waste of time and money.What a waste of time and money. What a waste of time and money. What a total waste.
3,Strangely enough . . .,"In what has got to be just about the only St. Patrick's Day romance out there, the king of the fairies gets together with a skeptical reporter, to recover a magic shoehorn. No, I am not kidding. I had few serious objections to this story (except for their premarital fling, unfortunately sadly typical of the American Romance line), but it was just kind of disappointing, since a lot of cute ideas were brought up and never developed much, the action was never very logical (ie, things happened for no reason), and the ending was pure shamrocks ex machina."
5,This is an excellent book!,"THE BOOK THAT I READ WAS THE RETURN OF THE HOME RUN KID . THIS BOOK IS ABOUT ABOUT A BOY WHO WAS LABLED THE HOME RUN KID CAUSE HE HIT A LOT OF HOME RUNS AND NOW HE IS BACK . HE WAS OUT CAUSE OF AN INJURY AND PLUS AFTER HE WAS WELL THE SEASON ENDED CAUSE BASEBALL SEASON WAS OVER. IN THIS BOOK THE BOY DIDN'T GET OFF TO A GOOD START BUT LATER ON HE WAS HITTING HOME RUNS LEFT , RIGHT ,AND MIDDLE AND THAT CONTINUED THROUGH HIS HOLE BASEBALL CAREER. THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK. BUY IT."
1,Not as advertised,"The jersey was advertised as a poly/cotton fabric, but what arrived was 100 percent polyester. Also, I ordered a 2XL and received an XL, told by Fan's Edge that the sizes don't arrive with the order so they ""just guess."" How helpful.I immediately returned the jersey and bought one I liked at Sports Authority. Still waiting for my refund, three months later."
4,"Eclectic mix of Jazz, Electronic, Pop instrumental themes","PASSED TIME is a mix of mostly instrumental jazz tapestries, which range from cool and remote (Track 5, ""Midnight Pearl"") to up-front and disarmingly honest (Track 4, ""My Daughter"") with various shades partway. Many tracks have a reflexive tongue-in-cheek quality, which happens when mischief meets abstraction.This is the sort of album that, if listened to in your car on a late night trip on a dark 2 lane highway, would coax formerly lost and distant thoughts to the surface once again. If played in a retail store as background music, it might initially sound like 'mall jazz' but the customers would look up when they hear the dog barking on Track 7, ""This Present Darkness.""Passed time is a bit reminiscent of Eschliman's earlier album, An Urban Christmas, particularly in terms of the 'mischief' element. (It's now out of print and hard to find these days, but worth the trouble.)"
4,This is a down home Ted's kind of music,"Ted did an excellent job in blending jazz and music flavors into songs that are real life. Ted makes the songs very enjoyable and fun to listen to. The song Jesus loves me is refreshing consider many other rendition had been out since Jesus is alive. Thanks for sharing your tapestry with us--Ted. By the way, I like that trombone solo, it makes me wondering whether Ted is playing the trombone with his pyjamas on and sitting on a love seat with Robin and Coco :)"
4,Armenian Phrasebook,"This is very good ""pronunciation"" dictionary for everyday travel phrases. It does not provide much help for reading, such as Armenian street signs or restaurant menu. If you're planning a brief stay in Armenia and want a small book for your jacket pocket, then this is probably the choice for you."
3,Ok travel book.,"I used this dictionary and phrasebook enough that it fell apart while I was traveling in Armenia. It was ok for travel but I would not recommend it for study. My wife who is Armenian found many errors in the book when I would ask ""Am I correct in my pronunciation?"", she would respond ""What!? Nobody says that, say it this way."" The book also lacks many commonly used phrases that should have been included as well. As other reviewers have noted, the phrasebook and dictionary is Romanized and lacks Armenian script so is not useful for reading signage. A very good English-Armenian dictionary (not phrasebook) can be found while traveling in Armenia though, and uses Armenian script. It is titled English Armenian Dictionary and is a green and black book printed in Yerevan. It cost me 3000 dram while I was there, the equivalent of approximately $9 USD."
3,More a tourist guide than a wordbook,"If yu are looking for a parlour to get around in Armenia, along with a simple wordbook covering the basics, this is your thing. I you need a wordbook to get around in the office and stuff like that, well, buy a real wordbook.The book is divided into chapters useful for different situations. The chapter about how to get around in the doctor's office contains the sentence ""please take off your clothes"". Does not always work on Armenians, but it is a nice ice breaker!"
1,"Eastern Armenian: Armenian-English, English -Armenian Dictionary","Totally useless, romanized, no accent marks given to indicare which syy\llable to be accented. Only useful for someone already familiar wit the language."
1,disappointment,"this dictionary is either out-dated or the writers simply did not think about how one would need to actually communicate while visiting Armenia. For the most part this dictionary is useless! Common words and phrases are not listed (like: how are you?), but what is in the dictionary is a section on war and relief aid---totally USELESS for your time in Yerevan or even in the village where I went to work for several weeks! some of the helpful parts were the ""grey boxes"" which highlighted food and drink or ""common expressions"" In fact, the word for yes is almost exclusively used as: Ha! not ayo, which is more of the western style."
1,Poorly written and unoriginal advice,"A friend of mine gave me this book, and I was disappointed. First, I read other business books before this one and felt that they were better and gave me real advice. Second, I showed this to my boyfriend, who had a good point. Why is this a ""women's guide"" to success. If we are to succeed as women we don't need special treatment. These ideas are about 20 years old. Come on Jane! It's the 21st century already. Can't there be a book for both men and women?Third, I already knew how to get a bank loan and how to make business cards. It's a very condescending book.Read the ""Seven Habits"" by Stephen McCovey or ""The Personal Touch"" by Terrie Williams for better advice."
1,Naive and unhelpful,"Although this book was recommended to me by a former co-worker who opened up her own office, I felt that I read it all before. Like ""Get a notebook to record everything you do."" DUH! I learned that at one of my first internships ten years ago. There are a ton of no brainer ideas."
5,Indispensable guide to starting your own business,"Reading Dive Right In made me feel like I had my own personal business advisor. I was just launching my own company when I found this book and I can't say enough about the valuable advice it contained. I especially appreciated the material about the challenges women, in particular, face in striking out on their own. It's sad but true that women continue to have fewer role models than men in the work world, and that we continue to be judged by different standards. Reading about Jane Wesman's own experience, and the experiences of the many women she interviewed, made me feel stronger in my own conviction that I really could do it. I have revisited the book again and again as I grew my business -- for example, the advice about hiring and motivating employees was extremely helpful. Whenever any of my friends tells me they're thinking about striking out on their own, I always recommend this book."
2,Spend your money elsewhere,"Seconding another reviewer, expect this caddy to rust. It's worth about $8 to $10 at best considering you are going to throw it out after a year. It gets a couple of stars from me because of its design, being fairly functional. But if it's going to rust out, why bother? I ended up throwing out actually two of them and finally biting the bullet by investing in a nonmetal shampoo, conditioner, hook, and shelf arrangment that affixes to the tile. Sure, it was much more expensive, but I've had the latter one for three years, there are no problems at all, and I'm never going to have to replace it."
1,i thought this was not supposed to rust.,I was very disappointed to find that this caddy started rusting within a couple of weeks after installing it -- look elsewhere!
1,Want Rust? Buy this Shower Caddy!,"I bought 2 of these. Exactly 2 weeks after putting them up, the rust started. It has now been about 8 months, and both are covered in rust, as if they are 10 years old, ready for the junk yard.Why do people make products like this? We all know showers are warm, moist places, right? So...why would someone make a shower caddy that disintegrates in the very place it was intended to be used?Very disappointing!"
4,More than just Callbacks,"Ginger Howard Friedman's book, ""Callback"", is about more than just what to do once you've got a callback. She tells you how to audition in the first place to succeed in getting a callback, and then how to sinch getting the part.Through explainations, examples, and anecdotes, Friedman shares with her readers what directors are looking for, what they hate, what they love, and even gives brief overviews as to how the whole process of auditions and callbacks work. The fact that the book was all-inclusive is what made it such a wonderful find from my point of view. Friedman leaves almost nothing unanswered, including how to audition for a potential manager or agent, and the secret as to just why most young actors impress directors at the actual audition, but then blow it completely at the callback.For a young acting student such as myself, this book gave me information that I didn't get from my college theater classes, making it an invaluable addition to my personal library."
5,EXCELLENT CD,This CD is great! I heard it from a friend and knew I had to have one of my own. Check it out...I definitely recommend it to everyone. Great job Len!
5,Easy to replace,It's super easy to replace your used up ink with this refill. The ink is so smooth that I never want to use another pen. My only beef with the product is that refills for the micro point only come in black and none of the other colors.
2,Uni-ball Vision Elite pen refills,"The refills are not worth the money you think you are saving. The threads on the screw-in refill are not substantial, and when you try to pull the cap off the pen, the bottom comes off in your hand, and you are left with the cap on the refill. Very inconvenient and not at all satisfactory."
3,Great title track,"Unfortunately for the album ""Human Touch,"" the simultaneously released album ""Lucky Town,"" received the bulk of the great songs Bruce Springsteen had to offer at that point. The absolutely fine love song that is the title track is the highlight. Beyond that the quality drops off considerably. By the end you find yourself longing for the since departed E Street band. Maybe Bruce got too contented as he approached middle age and found out that it was time for him to stop running."
4,Favorite of two releases,"This music moved me, catchy rhythms, thoughtful lyrics. In middle of Carlins bio of boss, interesting to see who played on album, not e street. Randy Jackson, Sam Moore, (can I get an amen), bunch of others."
4,Not all that bad.,"""Human Touch"" #2 (1992).Released at the same time as ""Lucky Town"", just like Guns And Roses did in 1991. This to me is one of the worst things the record companies did back in the early 90's. This album is Bruce's 3rd solo album without the E-Street Band, only Roy Bitten appears on this disc. Bruce brought in session guitarist Tim Pierce, old E-Street member David Sancious, the late Jeff Porcaro (Toto) on drums,(one of his last sessions) and American Idol's own Randy Jackson on bass. This release is a polished set in, ""Human Touch"", #1 MSR, #16 hot 100, the breezy ""Soul Driver"", ""57 Channels (And Nothing On)"", #6 MSR, #68 hot 100, not much on in '92. You also get the rowdy ""Roll Of The Dice""# 6 MSR, ""Man's Job"", the playful ""All Or Nothing At All"" and the gentle ""Pony Boy""."
4,understated classic..,"okay, so I'm a Springsteen die-hard and can't find fault with any of his recordings. This one came out in liason with LUCKY TOWN. HUMAN TOUCH is a great song that came out when Bruce was going throught some difficult personal stuff. So this collection is introspective but not as dark as some of his other work. All in all, good stuff."
4,"Human Touch, were is it now?","This album is the worst in bruces colection, but he has great albums, so this really earns a 4 1/2 stars. Human Touch is perhaps the best song I had ever heard in the 90, while Glorias Eyes, Man's Job, and All or Nothing at all. Buy it, u wont be disopionted"
3,You won't wish you were deaf,"Four great songs, ""Real Man,"" ""I Wish I Were Blind,"" ""Man's Job"" and ""With Every Wish,"" make Bruce Springsteen's HUMAN TOUCH worthwhile. Springsteen dared to please himself by releasing LUCKY TOWN and this CD at the same time. He could played it safe by combining the best tracks from each on just one album. HUMAN TOUCH (and LUCKY TOWN, for that matter) did not affect me the way several other Bruce albums have, but who knows, it could grow on me. For now, HUMAN TOUCH still merits listening."
2,Bruce makes average record without E-street band,"Bruce puts the E-street band on hold and releases A mediocre record.Unfortunately it contains some of the worst songs Bruce has ever released ""Real Man"",""Mans Job""and All Or Nothing At All"" are probably my least favorite Bruce songs.Also contains my good friend(and all time #1 Bruce fan) Ed's least favorite live Bruce song"" 57 Channels"""
3,"Okay, but repetitive","This book is easy to read in that it contains four short stories or ""novellas"". However the plots are predictable and the style of writing leaves you saying ""What?"" The stories could be more original and the writing style more imaginative. If you want a real mystery try ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle."
2,Tongue of shoe slips below laces!!!,"I usually like how Asics Nimbus or Kayano's fit my foot--I'm an endurance runner and have used Asics for 7 plus years. I thought I would love this pair, however, I realized when I ran over 7-10 miles, the tongue of the shoe slips down under the laces, which is very uncomfortable!! I was recently in a marathon and I had to keep stopping to readjust the tongue (pull it back out). Finally I gave up, resulting in discomfort and a bruise from the laces, after the race. I was very disappointed and hope this doesn't hinder any other runner or exerciser. Works well for crosstraining--comfortable shoe otherwise."
3,Defect,"The shoes came very quickly and packed very appropriately, but there is a defect in my right shoe and it gives me terrible blisters. I don't feel I can return them because I've already run outside in them - don't ever buy running shoes online!!"
5,Fantastic shoe!,This is the second time that I've purchased this shoe. It's one of the best that Asics has to offer. I received the shoes fast with no problems.
3,An essential must have!,"Quite an essential addition for this vacuum, but the product should have been engineered so as not to require this extension hose. Besides, there is no onboard storage for this extension hose. You have to find another place to store it until you need to use it."
4,"Useful, but Stiff","This a useful addition to the Hoover vacuum, but as others have noted the 'stretch' on the hose is very stiff. Although I haven't measured it, I seriously doubt it is capable of stretching out to a full 20 feet. We don't have stairs in the house, but bought it to use in those hard to reach places - plant shelves, high ceilings, etc. - and it is handy for that although a bit bulky because of the stiffness. In short, it's tightly coiled and will pull over the vacuum when you're trying to stretch it out. If you need extra vacuuming ""reach"", this is your only real choice."
3,OK for direct duust pick up...,"The hose is well-made and ok for just direct dust pick-up, but the upholstery tool with the tiny rotating brush won''t work with it, as, even tho the vacuum (Hoover bagless WindtunnelI) is very powerful, the suction isn't that great when a really long hose like this is attached."
1,Wrong product,"I had to return the hose -- and pay for all shipping [a total of almost $20] -- all because the description on Amazon did not specify that it was for vacuums WITH BAGS. Mine is bagless, and the hose didn't fit."
5,Smart Purchase,I bought this stretch hose so that I can easily vacuum the cold air returns for my furnace/air conditioner. The hose is very flexible and is made to last. I highly recommend it.
4,Stretch hose needed some 'modification' to fit.,"The plastic knobs on the hose where it attaches to the vacuum cleaner were a fraction too big for the slot on the Hoover Widepath Tempo. The hose of course is advertised for the WindTunnel version. Luckily, the knobs are plastic and I sacrificed one of my diamond nail files and filed down one side of each knob, and that did the trick. I am a little concerned about the coil hose part especially at the top because the coil seems kind of flimsy, but it appears other people have made an accommodation for this by using duct tape. I haven't used this attachment yet...I hope it works as expected!"
3,A Hoover Wind Tunnel Must,"The hose that comes with the Wind Tunnel models is just not practical for use with the attachments when one needs to reach. The longer hose really does make cleaning blinds, ceiling fixtures, closets, and corners much easier."
3,Doesn't quite reach,Hardly comes close to stretching 20 feet. Stick with the one that comes with the vacuum as it appears sturdier too.
5,Great Idea!!!,"Thanks to these Amazon hose reviews I saved money! I filed the ears from end of the eight foot extension hose that came with the vacuum and connected it to the shorter vacuum hose. That made it a great extended hose! Two wraps of tape make the connection leakproof and tight. My five foot wife reaches the ceilings without effort! Next, for a simple way to vacuum the carpets, I wrapped the combined hoses around the vacuum cleaner and attached the end to the base. It worked well! Also, our vacuum never tips. With the extended hose, I just lay the vacuum on its back and move it when I need to reach another area."
5,Great Vacume Hose,"I Have been looking,All over Even a Hover store and they could not find one, So i looked you up an had a million choices."
2,Incorrect product for Hoover bagless vacuum,"Amazon has shown this hose bundled with Hoover bagless vacuums. In fact it is for Hoover vacuums with bags.It will NOT fit on Hoover bagless vacs, such as UH70210. You can make it usable by buying an adapter from the plumbing dept at stores such as Home Depot, Lowe's, etc, but it will not fit unless modified. The ends of the hose on the vac and the extended hose are the same size, so you cannot use it as advertised. It is an extended hose to replace the shorter hose on Hoover vacs with bags."
5,Hoover Wind Tunnel Deluxe Stretch Hose,"I should have purchased this extended hose when I bought the vacuum.It reaches all the way up a set of stairs just like they say it doesand makes the job of vacuuming the stairs so much easier. I also useit now for regular vacuuming as I can go alot further without draggingthe vacuum with me. Sometimes the vacuum used to fall because I pulledit too hard; now, that doesn't happen. Great product."
2,Disappointing,"False advertising. It is only 15'-16' *fully* stretched and is only a ""20' reach with wands and crevice tool"" according to the tiny print on the bottom box. This is not an extension but fits as a replacement, so you are only getting 9'-10' more reach than the original 6' hose. That is still helpful, altho the quality of the tubing is 1/2 that of the original hose and will not sustain pulling or pinching with the same durability."
1,Hoover 20 foot hose,"This is a product that sounds much better than it really functions. First of all, it isn't 20 feet long. It doesn't stretch easily, pulls over the vacuum cleaner whenever it's stretched very far, and it only extends usefully about 8-10 feet. On the box it comes in it states that with all extensions and tubes added, then it reaches 20 feet. This product is simply falsely marketed as something that it is not. It should be marked as a 10 foot extension hose. For the price, it is grossly overpriced. It's worth about $10. I don't think two of them connected together would stretch out easily to 20 feet. And, you had better have someone around to hold up the vacuum cleaner while using it. It's easier to move the vacuum cleaner than use this."
4,Hard to find product,"a little awkward to have on vacuum, but other hose was too short, and rather stiff, not allowing for using the attachments with ease."
4,Excellent product,"First off, I would recommend this product. It works as advertised. It is somewhat hard to extend because of the vacuum' suction."
4,great for cleaning the stairs,"I bought this extension to go with my windtunnel to vacuum the stairs. It works well and I can leave the vacuum at the bottom when I use it. It's a little heavy, so I only have it on the vacuum when I'm using it for the stairs. Other than that, I leave the standard hose on."
2,Over Springy,"This hose does make the reach a bit more as compared to the original hose, but it acts much shorter than advertised due to the hose being too springy and not extending nearly enough before tipping over the vacuum."
5,Minimized my stress and injuries,"I love this! I hesitated to purchase it for my Hoover Tempo due to the price; however, the original Tempo hose was made so poorly it always collapsed upon itself, or caused the entire vacuum to fall on me when I used the hand tools. I like my Tempo. I also have pets and vacuum often, so after being whacked one too many times in the head by the vacuum, I decided this new hose was the definitely way to go. (I'm still attending school and I need all my brain cells.) The locking portion on this hose matches the one on the Tempo perfectly. The hose is quite long, so to keep it from dragging/drooping I put it onto the hose hook (as with the original hose); then, I wrap the hose around the front of the vacuum once before attaching it to the inlet. Now the vacuum works exactly as I wanted. I'm so glad I bought this."
3,Better than nothing,"Too bad Hoover's engineers did not think the overall sweeper product through well in the first place. This ""extension"" is obviously an afterthought, and it came too late, so it could not be fitted properly onto the sweeper the way the sweeper was already designed. This hose REPLACES the existing hose -- it does not just add on to it, so you lose the 2' or so of the original hose that could have been used. Also, as other reviewers have noted, this hose is not very flexible in terms of stretching out. It stretches only a little, and any further pulling on it just pulls your sweeper over.That being said, once you figure out how to use it with the limitations, it is better to have the extra 8' or so that this hose really does give you, than to struggle with the original hose. (Although, when you use the sweeper as a normal upright, you have to put the original hose back on, or else somehow work around all the extra hose hanging off.)"
4,Good addition to your Hoover vacuum,The hose is great for cleaning drapes and stairs. Too cumbersome to leave on the machine permanently. You can still pull to hard or to far and tip the vacuum. But overall I'm pleased with the purchase.
3,not an extension hose,"read carefully if you are purchasing this hose, as i thought it was an extension hose to add length to vaccum hose. it turns out that you have to remove the original hose from the machine and hook this one on, which is ok if you are not going to do curtains or baseboards etc and then go back to regular vaccuming. the hose has no where to hang for regular vaccuming."
5,Hoover 20 ft. extension hose for Windtunnel upright self propelled vacuum cleaner,"I ordered the Hoover Remanufactured Upright Self Propelled Vacuum and the hose is too short to vacuum my walls, so I ordered the 20 ft. extension hose, and too my suprise, I can now clean everything in my house. Highly recomended."
1,Does Not Fit WindTunnel T Series,"Not known what if any Hoover this fits-I was misinformed that it would fit the bagless-so I gave that one to my grandson and bought a WindTunnel T with bags as it states on the box ""For ALL WindTunnel Uprights That Use Bags""-it would not fit this WindTunnel T-this is a P.A.W.S. model-meaning has a dog hair accessary (that did not work) -have no idea what Hoover WindTunnel this will work with--very disappointed as can not return (over 90 days)-these Hoover WindTunnel vacs need a longer hose-hard to belive that one is not made that fits my WindTunnel T series--which I bought specifically to be able to use this hose. Don't buy this unless you really know it will fit!"
3,Not that great,it's ok..but it has to be stretched out to get that long...and it doesn't suck quite as well as the short one
1,wrong size,"this hose did not fit my sweeper which is a hoover windtunnel t-series pet rewind plusand i was very disappointed! i had to return it, & am still looking for a hosethat will fit my sweeper. i love the sweeper but those is so short, it's stupid!why would they make it that short?! so if anyone out there found the rightkind please respond! thanks!"
4,great upgrade,"Great product, now i can do my stairs and giant sectional couch with ease, no more restricted movement, I highly recommend this product."
2,Doesn't quite fit the vacuum correctly.,"The quality of this hose is excellent. Same as the smaller original one. It is longer and does extend the reach a fair amount. My problem is that it doesn't fit on the vacuum properly. Each end connects like the original but because the hose is slightly longer than the original when fully compressed for storage, it doesn't lay in the retaining groove like the original. It just sort of flops off to the side of the vacuum and catches things as you vacuum. I'm returning it. The floppy hose is more frustrating that having to move the vacuum to get hard to reach places."
4,Worth buying,Works well but if you try to stretch it anyway near 15 to 20 feet it is difficult to pull that far and will tip over the vacuum.
2,too long,"I got this to replace the original hose which finally just collapsed. The hose is well made, but it's so long, it hangs off the vacuum like saggy skin."
4,Must have,"This extra hose makes my vacuum much easier to use. However, I had to super glue it to the existing hose because it slipped off so easily. Now it works great."
2,20-Foot?? Nope,"The hose will work, but will not function at 20 feet. After about 15 feet, it will pull any connections apart, and will topple the vacuum cleaner well before the 15 foot stretch. The biggest stretch is the description."
1,terrible attachment,"The idea that this is a twenty foot extension is completely ludicrous. If you have a strong person hold onto the vacuum it is possible to get this extended to twenty feet, but if you don't have anyone holding onto the vacuum you are lucky to get 6 feet out of it. Any attempt to extend it further will likely topple the vacuum potentially damaging furniture or walls. I've damaged at least two walls severely."
3,read which models it will work on first,Just wanted to save some folks a tip about hose extension.Hoover is a great product of course. I just bought the hoover wind tunnel pet rewind model. We love the machine but agree the hose is a little short. So we ordered the extension hose. As always on time. The problem is this hose will not fit then hoover wind tunnel pet rewind model. We do hope they can engineer one for our model.
3,Definitely not 20ft long!,"I bought this extension with the intent of cleaning my carpeted stairs, at least half way up without lifting the vacuum. No way... this hose is longer than the standard hose, but DEFINITELY not 20 ft long. Maybe 10 ft at the most. Still, it is better than the original hose and I leave it on the vacuum to give me a longer hose for cleaning corners, hard floors, reaching air vents, etc... Also, the connection is just like the original hose and does attach perfectly at the suction end. I wrap the extra hose around the handle and keep iot ready to go all the time. As far as value goes, not worth $30 but would feel OK about paying about $15-20 for it."
4,hoover 20 foot hose for Wind Tunnel,"This hose really is a great addtion to the Hoover Wind Tunnel. Rmember an upright cannot get under the couch and into small nooks and crannies. If you like the Wind Tunnel, then you probably should buy this hose."
5,great bag!,"I use it for my Sony DSLR. hold camera with lens, 5 other lens, battery charger, extra batteries, filters and more.even hold my pocket mini camera."
2,No,This is far smaller than expected. It will not hold two cameras and lenses. Only a body and very few accessories. It would be good for a trip with limited amount of equipment. Build quality is very good. It is not for professional use.
4,"Excellent bag, bad internal distribution","The bad feature of this product is that it does have one velcro pad on the inside that allow you to re-size the storage compartments to your own personal needs, the rest of the pads, only have the velcro to adapt, but it is very limited. I had the Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack 200EG for Canon EOS SLR Cameras, it's zippers were strong but difficult to manage, so I changed it for this bag; but I'm disapointed, because of the difficult to design your own space, the pads make it very limited.It can carry very well the tripods that are light. I'm buying a 6 pounds tripod, and I don't know how is going to work in it."
2,too short - too little,"This is a fairly nice bag - if you don't have any large lenses. I have a Canon 5d with 24 - 105, a Canon 100-400 lens, a Canon 50mm, and a Canon 580ez flash -- there is no way to get these items in the bag and keep them readily available for use."
5,Awesome Bag!,"Just received the Canon 1EG Gadget Bag for my new Rebel Xsi and I absolutely LOVE IT! Everything has a place with lots of padding and protection. Many zipper pouches for holding extra batteries, memory cards, etc. I much prefer this to the backpack and hard case I bought for my last Rebel. I highly recommend this bag to anyone wanting something that will hold and protect their camera and accessories."
4,"Great gear bag, solid build","I've had the bag for a little over 2 weeks now, and am enjoying it well...I can carry 2 Canon DSLRs quite comfortably with 4 lenses (16-35, 24-70, 24-105, and 70-200), and 1 flash (420)Only issue I have is the bag height - it is a little tight having the 24-70 mounted on a body, and loading it vertically.Overall, great price and sturdy build (bag stays firm fully loaded), and the non-slip shoulder pad keeps the bag secured when carrying...Would definitely recommend!"
5,Excellent bag at good price,"What can I say, this bag stores my gear and does what I need it to do. I had outgrown the smaller, backpack style bag that Canon makes, so I upgraded to this bag. I am really satisfied with the quality of construction and the layout of the interior."
2,TOO SMALL!!!,"I agree with others, that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this bag... IF you only have one camera and a bunch of lenses. However, I have 2 DSLR's and there is NO WAY to fit them in this bag unless you disconnect the lenses first. If you are looking for a bag to keep more than one camera in, this is NOT for you."
3,Canon Big Bag,"Superbly made bag, but far too large for my Canon gear: Rebel XTI, 17-85 IS lens, 70-300 IS lens, and Canon large flash. Side and front pockets more than I needed. Had to return bag to Amazon."
4,An Outstanding Read,"I am the fortunate owner of a signed first edition of the 1994 limited edition and I am thrilled to see it in print again. I cannot recommend it too highly as a valuable addition to the LRRP genre. I have many many books in my collection of 490 books on the Vietnam War which cover LRRPS, rangers etc and this is one of the best. It gives a much fuller account of the man and his experiences than many others in this field. The endorsement of such luminaries as Michael Lanning, Jim Morris and Keith Nolan all of whom produced standout works should be enough for any reader. When you have enjoyed the book check out the video."
1,Disappointing,"I was under the impression that this book was a true to life accounting of events leading up to the Tet Offensive of 1968. I bought the book based upon the recommendations here. I was disappointed to find that it was more of a heavily gilded diary, with little to no credibility where actual events are recounted.Further, I did not enjoy the overall ego-centricity of the contents, and would've like to read about the accomplishments of the men in this LRP unit, rather than the personal jabs (sometimes scornful) and off-hand speculations of the first-person author.I've judged the contents of this book as misleading, but perhaps others will enjoy it more as a story that plays fast and loose with the facts. I guess I was just expecting this book to be more of a hard-core Vietnam era combat account. [...]"
1,not what title implies,"The books name belies its content. The part of the book that pertained to service was in the last few chapters. The first part of his book was all about his childhood and school problems he had which, to me, was not the name of the book. Yes, the language was salty, but this is to be expected when decribing language in the boonies. This book was a cathartic for the authors feelings and I for one did not appreciate it. For me it was a waste of time trying to read this treatise."
4,Works just fine,I bought this mobile base for the Model 60HH Powermatic jointer. It arrived in fine condition by UPS - it's one piece in a relatively large box - no assembly required. The jointer fits into it well. I only wish that the wheel locks on the two non-turning wheels were something better than bolts with star knobs on them which turn into the wheel face (and one of the bolt holes wasn't tapped too great and when combined with the paint on the threads makes it pretty tough to turn). B+
3,"Good, but just more of the same","Solid Sevendust album. Exactly what I expected, but nothing more. I really do like Sevendust's sound, but once you've heard one song from this album, you've heard the whole album (as usual for them). And once you've heard one album you've pretty much heard all of them. Given the inflated scores on this board, I'm sure some will disagree, but there really is very little difference from one Sevendust album to the next. Sure, the intensity of the sound differs, but the sound itself is always the same. They have a formula. It's good in terms of consistency, but they'll never really surprise either. And that leaves a lot to be desired."
5,LONG WAITED; MEAT AND POTOES. THANKS AGAIN,"SO HERE WE ARE AGAIN, VERY MELODIC AND VERY, VERY, HEAVY FOR 7D. TIME TO GO BACK TO OUR ROOTS, AND THANK'S AGAIN. THIS MAY JUST MIGHT BE THE BEST TO COME FROM THE 7D BROS YET!! I CAN'T EVEN SAY ENOUGH."
2,Very Disappointed,"I'm a die hard Sevendust fan and have been true to the band since day one, but their new album just doesn't cut it. The songs blur together and their best song on the album is their single. I went to their latest concert tour and was also disappointed. I think they're trying to be too flashy and have gotten away from their true talent. They need to take a breather and get back to how their previous albums were, which were top notch by the way. Sevendust, I love you, but you gotta get back in the swing of things."
3,"Good, but no ""Anomsity""","It's WAAAY better than their last album (2005's ""Next""). But that's not saying much. It seems that since founding guitarist and principal song-writer Clint Lowery left in late 2004, the band has lacked the spark that ignited the fire in albums such as ""Animosity"" and ""Seasons."" It has it's high points, such as the energetic ""Deathstar"" and catchy lead-single ""Driven"", but the album as a whole also has many boring lows that make me wonder if Sevendust is beyond repair."
1,The Sevendust Disappointment,"The new album ""alpha"" sounds like a completely different band. I understand that Sevendust has changed quite a bit since their debut album that was self titled. I don't necessarily think it was a great decision to change but I bought and kept and still listen to every sevendust album ever recorded besides ""alpha"" Lejon has the best voice in the genre of rock. He has the tough and aggressive vocals that can be changed to the greatest singing voice in rock. I felt like this album completely wasted this talent by using way too much of Morgan's vocals and not Lejon's. Morgan does not have good vocals for screaming or singing. Sevendust does not need two vocals or three vocals when you have Lejon. I tolerated Morgan's voice in the album ""next"" but ""alpha"" just has way too much of his vocals. I give this album 1 star because there is not enough Lejon and too much Morgan vocals."
5,Awesome!! I am Never Dissapointed!,Sevendust has always been one of my favorite bands! I was a bit dissapointed with next but I was completely blown away by Alpha. I saw them live the day I bought the CD and I haven't stopped listening to it. They seem to really want to get back to the Roots of Their self titled CD. My Favorite Songs are Driven and Beg to Differ! I highly Reccomend it!
5,Great,"Best Sevendust CD in years! They are back. They dropped the Electronica, the slow songs, and all the sap. Born again hard, I didn't think they could be this heavy!"
4,RELAXING,I ordered BEYOND THE RELAXATION RESPONSE to replace the one I had worn out reading. It is an excellent tool for learning to relax and deal with the stresses of the day.The purchasing process went smoothly. Thank you
2,It was okay,"I had higher expectations for this book, but found it to be repetitive and not very informative. After the first chapter, you need not read more."
2,so small :[,"this thing is lame -it looks nothing like ketchup, other than its red, my daughter hands it to me and has the look like ""what am I to do with this thing"" its more doll house size and its way smaller compared to all her other ""fake""foods, I got it as a add- on item and it was just rolling around the box, not packaged at all, and the picture shows 2 but you only get one. I would get something else if your reading this...."
5,Who is Barry Chamish and what else has he written?,"I have been student of the Middle East for the past 40 years and have read hundreds of books on the Arab-Israeli conflict. All of them combined don't add up to what Mr. Chamish done: he has given us the real story, not the propaganda we read in the so-called ""free press"".One can only wonder what this man can write for an encore.Efraim Menashe Kibbutz Amchofshi Israel"
1,Pathetic Lies from the UFO chasing conspiracy nut,"Save your money. Chamish is 100 times stupider and more idiotic than the worst ""911 Truth"" Cult of Conspiracy Nuts"
4,Good Magic Story,"I liked how when he went to the bubble gum machine, he got that special gum and made him invisible and he had all sorts of adventures."
4,A fourth grade student review,"This book is about a kid named Pete and his brother and Halloween is coming up and Alex is going trick or treating with his gang. Then Alex asked ""If he could go to the bathroom"". So the person who is handing out candy said ""yes"". So Alex went into a room and a person was sleeping in that room and he went to the bathroom and Alex woke up the person who was sleeping, and she thought Alex was stealing her diamond ring. So she called the cops. So Pete had some gum that made you invisible and he ate one and walked up the stairs and gave a piece to Alex and they went out of the house and went home and counted there candy. Invisible In The Third Grade is a great book that you should read. I really enjoyed it and laughed as I read it. ~Dr. Pepper"
4,Herlin Riley's A Gem !,"Herlin Riley gives a great performance and instruction in the old style of playing, and leads up to the newer styles. Highly recommended..Nicholas Payton is on trumpet but seems to be having a bad day, as does the piano player who hits clams on ""High Society"". The trio plays better on ""Oh Didn't He Ramble"". However the focus is on the drumming and thats what counts.Johnny Vidacovich gives a fine performance and instruction as well.I have not gotten to the last two drummers ( Earl Palmer and Herman Ernest) but would recommend the DVD on just the first two gents alone.If you want to learn New Orleans style drumming, this is the best DVD I have seen so far. The companion book to this DVD is very good and highly recommended as well."
3,A Nice Part of the X-Factor Collection,"I bought this trunk to complement the X-Factor brief and undershirt I had bought previously.Like its linemates, the fabric is superb and adapts to your body shape well, producing no lines visible on your pants. It also comes in a nice selection of colors. I liked the grey waistband, so I went with white.My only complaint is that the legs tend to ride up a little, and the rise is a little high, possibly due in part to the X-Factor fabric's nature.At any rate, I highly reccommend the X-Factor brief as well."
1,Terrible quality. Buy the Classic,"I own all three versions of the ECCO Pro series, and they are all terrible quality. The handles are cheap plastic and easily break. I've replaced the cheap plastic piece that holds the handle several times. Worse, the motors lasted about a day longer than the warranty. It's been a total of 2 years, and I have ONE functioning ECCO Pro filter...and that's because I've used spare parts from all the broken ones. Eheim is a good brand, but this model was Eheim's attempt at the ""entry level"" market. Fail. There's a reason most stores don't carry this garbage model anymore. Get the Eheim Classic. Proven design, long history. Avoid this one."
5,Best pens,I have been using these pens for years & they are my absolute favorites. They write very smooth & with bold color. Love em!
5,GREAT SHOW! GREAT MUSIC! GREAT STORY! GREAT LESSON!,"I would HIGHLY recommend this to any parent who appreciates, QUALITY, CREATIVITY, SUBSTANCE & MOST OF ALL....... FUN!!! Our whole family really LOVED this show! It has great songs that we were all singing in no time! It's funny with a really touching story. I liked that it was clever and had a moral message that our kids could all relate to. The message was, we're all special just the way we are, friends are a valuable treasure, it's important to say you're sorry to someone you've hurt and important to forgive someone that's hurt you. Not rocket science to be sure, but GREAT life lessons for us all to remember. The message was delivered simply through an engaging story with wonderful songs & adorably hip characters! Our children have watched this show every day since we got it, and sometimes more than once a day!"
5,We need More Musicland Band Episodes!!!!!,"Although not a parent myself, I have shown this and bought for several of my friends' children and they can't get enough of it. I wish there were more episodes and stuffed characters as all the kids are into the many characters especially the Sticky Twins & Gil. The music is funny and smart and not as annoying as some of the other twangy songs you hear on other children's videos. I appreciate the moral theme surrounding the value of friendships and love which is what children need to learn at young ages"
2,it's ok.,"i have played this game and never beaten it. it's not hard or anything its just boring and a bit laggy. The thing that got me irritated the most is that this game is simlilar to pokemon where you level up to get stronger. i'm just sick of that type of gaming, you find a monster you like its at the lowest level and you have to level it up again. soo time consuming."
4,Useful evolved Spectrobes,"Spectrobes evolved forms are some of the greatest forms that are almost the greatest, but the Goes are the best. My house has flies, there are barely any flying creatures in this game, but this games reminds me of my house. Battling for evolving minerals are the best way to help your Spectrobes. I really like it!(Review by Xander, an 8 year old)"
4,Spectrobes-the ups and downs,"Nanairo planetary patrol officer Rallen and his partner Jeena discover an escape pod with an old man inside. Nicknamed 'Mr. X' the man eventually awakes and informs Rallen about spectrobes, beasts that are used to fight the evil Krawl. This game, in short, is fast-paced, challenging, and interesting to the max. An action packed plotline brings Rallen to seven planets in search of the Krawl nest. Activties in this game include incubating Spectrobes, Battling krawl, and digging up and awakening fossils. I greatly enjoyed this game overall, and I am confident you will, too."
5,Great and fun game,The gameplay is very intriguing and the control of the Spectrobes in battle is very intuitive and interactive. The storyline is very immersive and unique. The entire game concept is just great and I would recommend this to anyone who loves a fun game.
4,"Good, inexpensive game","My 10 year old daughter loves this game, and it was not expensive at all. She found it to be very fun and easy to understand."
3,A waste of your time. Don't bother.,"The story is nonexistent and the controls in battle are poorly mapped and the battles aren't fun at all. Everything that this game tries to do was done better by Pokemon or Digimon 10 years ago, and a lot of the newer DS titles by those franchises blow this game out of the water so much that's it's not even on the same planet. The Dragon Quest Monsters games are also another possibility.Shovelware, pure and simple. Avoid."
3,worth reading,"My nine-year-old enjoyed having me read this book to him, though it was not nearly as compelling as some other math books we've read for fun, such as Math Trek or The Number Devil. I liked his getting a better picture of the real meanings of big numbers, since he'd had a lamentable tendency to use the words for large numbers, such as ""million"", ""billion"", and ""trillion"", interchangeably. My five-year-old enjoyed the pictures, though he really did not get the concepts."
3,U of A South Elem. Education Student,"I liked that this book was fun, but it was hard to read and go from bubble to bubble on every page. That made it very easy to get lost in and throughout the story. I did like that it had a lot of fun facts, which came in handy for older kids at least 4th grade. The book was also very good for the powers of 10. I would recommend it for teachers who are at least 4th grade to about 6th grade."
2,"Great concept, but waste of money","When I purchased this item I thought, ""what a brilliant idea!"". But while it's great to have a water bottle and bowl all in one, this thing is cheaply made and a waste of money. The bowl attachment broke off on the first use. And you really won't want to pour your dog's slobbery, dirty water back into the canteen for a 2nd use. I'm still using this, as it's convenient, but wouldn't recommend to others."
4,Solid useful product,"Interesting & useful way to carry water for your pets on foot or in the car. This is not earth-shaking innovation, it is practical & useful. I wish they made a larger size, as I have two large dogs."
2,Poorly Made,"I purchased three of these over the course of a few months: two for me, and one as a gift. I really liked the compact size -- It was perfect for taking along in the car or on walks. However, the stoppers, which are held on by two very thin and flimsy pieces of plastic, broke off within weeks with just normal use. It's a shame, because the bowl worked great..."
1,"Great Concept, VERY poorly made!","Needed a larger water bottle for my 75lb Bernese Mountain Dog and this 32 ouncer seemed like the perfect one. I used it once. It leaked like crazy, the rubber seal came off right away, and the plastic hinge tore almost immediately. Do not purchase this item, you will be thoroughly disappointed."
1,Pet Canteen,This product did not serve very well. Hard to use and I returned it after one use. I don't recommend it.
2,Poor design on cap retainer strap. Broken twice,"This pet canteen would be a great product if it were not for a design flaw. There is a thin, brittle plastic strap that keeps the cap plug from getting lost while using the funnel. If this were attached with a rubberized strap if would be great. We received our first item broken, ordered a replacement which was also broken upon arrival, and are now getting a refund."
3,Pleased,"We take our dog for walk to give her some exercise. She is part lab part shepherd. As you may guess she is a large dog that needs exercise. Here in Houston it gets extremely hot from around 11:00 a.m. until around 6:00 p.m. You absolutely must hydrate or die. We normally take a separate bottle of water for her but I have to pour the water in my hand for her to get any. This product was great for this purpose and any traveling we might do.Drinkwell Hydro-Go Pet CanteenBelle, our dog, loves it!"
3,Standard crime family drama,"Attempts to ride the Godfather popularity wave. Okay story, but not as compelling as Puzo's work. Good performance by Douglas."
3,Solid effort,"Kirk Douglas is the sturdy center piece of ""The Brotherhood"", an early mafia family saga. Douglas is electric but the movie itself pales next to the classic ""The Godfather"", because of a predictable plot, pedestrian direction and also weaker supporting actors - particularly Alex Cord. But it is well worth seeing for Douglas alone."
1,Ruined 3 Shirts,"Here's a test for you. Put the point of one of these uniball pens on a paper towel and watch the ink just spread. Do the same with a papermate and there is no ink transfer. Why does this matter? Because if you happen to have one of these pens on your desk and it comes into contact with your sleeve, you can forget about that shirt. I have banned all these pens from my office."
1,I didnt get what I should be getting!!,OK. Either it's me or it's this thing I bought. I didnt get any fun and I am unhappy!!! Now whom should I blame??
5,Purchased as present,Purchased this for husband birthday present - very pleasantly surprised that my husband likes & uses. He has almost everything he wants & very hard trying to think of something neat to get him as present - this was good high tech toy & he looks cool with the kids & grandkids (when they use indoors this one doesn't break).
3,Very Nice IR Scope but not 100% as mentioned by mfg.,"I have the Igen 20/20 for 2 years now. It is a work horse but their are a few problems.1. It would be nice if the company added a power supply jack for longer use.2. The springs that hold the batteries tend to get compressed over time and makes for a poor battery connection.3. Use rechargable batteries otherwise you will pay a lot for regular batteries.4. The image is not as the company advertises. It does have distortion on the edges...not 100% as they claim.5. When viewing lights far away at night, bright lights are blurry. If you turn the gain down it looks better but you can no longer see dimmer lights. This 20/20 is ok but can use some improvments.6. I wish the company made this IR camera with HD or better resolution and had a little more magnification (3 to 5 power) for other applications."
1,Life expectancy...not long,For the price and manufacturers reputation I would have expected it to last longer than a year. It did...one year 3 months...not long enough. It was leaky and the heat was inconsistent. I am very disappointed in the product and it found it's way into the trash yesterday.
5,4 Years of daily use and still going strong!,"I love this iron. I am very, very picky about my irons and would never use something if it wasn't efficient and comfortable to use. I have found this Rowenta iron to be exactly that and more!I have found that it never leaks, never leaves unwanted residue on our clothes, and never stains anything - unlike all my previous b&d; irons.It glides so well and SERIOUSLY gives me first swipe results! I never have to physically push down on the iron! It is a joy to use so much so that I actually ENJOY ironing all my husband's shirts!We have owned it for 4 years and I use it daily and have never cleaned it or had any problems with it. It was well worth the $135 we paid for it 4 years ago."
1,An Honest Review From an Ironing Fanatic,PURCHASED AND RETURNED IN THE SAME DAY. Extremely disappointed! Was looking to replace my five year-old Black and Decker Pro Finish 750 ($90 top of the line at the time). The old Black and Decker blows this thing away any day. One-swipe ironing that produces flawless results is not inherent in this ultimate expression of German household engineering. Ramie and Linen shirts took forever and were still wrinkled in some areas. Jeans were not crisp. Also the Rowenta seemed too lightweight. Bothersome design flaw of no on/off switch also puzzling. (Heard it's for safety but I don't particularly care for plugging in or unplugging live wired appliances). Those reviewers that rave about Rowenta on here must have never used a real iron. One that allows you to do a quick one-pass and voila...wrinkle free perfection in a matter of seconds.
1,Very disappointed,"This is my second Rowenta. The first one lasted 3 years, it was OK just that it wasn't warming anymore, I liked the weight. The DM 991 has a nice temperature but it leaks a lot. I'm very disappointed."
4,"Great essays, terrible copy editing in Kindle version","The essays on this book present a fascinating series of perspectives psychoanalysis has to offer to learning. I found that, as usual, reading psychoanalysts brings important issues and perspectives to light in beautiful, meaningful ways. The book, at least the Kindle version, is filled with horrible typos and poor formatting. This should be fixed, or the Kindle version should not be sold. I don't know if these are replicated in the print version. Book is well worth reading, regardless."
3,Splatter screen,"Nice item, easy to use and something that I've been wanting for a while. I would recommend it."
3,slow,"Book arrived within specified time but.... other books I have purchased from other sellers arrive between 2.5 to 5 days, this paperback book took 9 days not including weekends... way too long in my opinion. I think they are just ordering it from someone else then repackaging it and sending it to me. I don't know that for sure but that would explain the very long mailing time with no tracking whatsoever. That way you don't ever know where the book really is in the shipping process."
5,Too Much Gain!,"Do you like the soul side of The JB's? O.V.Wright?Slow, grinding stuff that's mellow and tight?If you are looking for a southern soul compilationthat goes beyond the most obvious songs, then thisis an excellent choice.Some truly amazing stuff on this one. Eugene Evans,never even heard of the man, sings his heart out onthree tracks, and ""Too much pain"" is a stone coldclassic.In addition to Evans, a James Brown influenced soulshouter, you get great songs from Robert Moore, BillySoul, Lord Thunder, Cody Black, Sam Baker and GloriaWalker. Walker's ""When my baby cries"", is a supersweetlovesong and a maybe the shiniest thing on here,togheter with ""Too Much Pain"" and ""One Hurt"".It's not all killers, no fillers though. There are some weakand too sentimental tracks on it, but all in all it's aimposingly even compilation."
3,"Final Fantasy 1, but with a job class system","Ok ok, maybe this game has a bit more of a story behind it then final fantasy 1, but not much. It is a pretty short game, I am almost at the end, only reason I haven't beaten it is because I'm so bored with it and rarely play it.The worse part of it, the job system. I have said it before, but I hate that all characters are equal and can do anything. Everyone is different, they should have there own strengths and weaknesses. Could make this game incredibly easy if you just pick the best classes, but too easy just isn't fun, now is it?I can see why this game didn't make it over to the states when it first came out, but it is a classic. If you don't mind all your characters being equal in everything, then this game is for you!"
4,FF III Not for the faint of heart,"This game is incredibly difficult. I only recommend it for serious strategy players with lots of patience. While it can be totally frustrating it is also very addictive. An online guide is a must have to find hidden idems, LIKE SWORDS IN A CLUMP OF GRASS. Pretty good music and graphics, cool job system. Totally random attack powers, will die a lot, and have no idea where you are going or what your doing at points. story is not well developed, you are saving the world imagine that. As I said I have become addicted to the game despite its flaws. A must have for FF Fans."
5,A Final Fantasy you must buy!!!,"This game is great! Good controls, gameplay, and graphics. The only thing wrong with this game is the generic storyline that can be found in other RPGs. Other than that thee is nothing wrong with it. It is pretty long for a rpg on a handheld."
4,It's all fun and games until the end,"HAving never played one of the FF games with jobs, it took me a while to get into the feel of it. It's a fun system. The game is big enough to really enjoy for a while. I must caution you, without spoiling anything, the Crystal Tower at the end...there is no save point even after you spend about an hour in there. And the boss is about an hour further...be sure to level up a lot before going to the end or you'll end up flinging your DS acrosss the room when you get sent back several level and hours of work."
4,A Wonderful Game All-Around,I love how you can change your job whenever you want and how there are so many different types. I recommend this game for all RPG/fantasy fans. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
3,"Great game, many flaws.","Final Fantasy has been one of my favorite series to follow since they came out.I had very high hopes for this game, and they were met for the most part.Pros:Graphics:10/10No words can describe themSound:9/10Can get repetitiveControls:10/10Buttons or stylus; your choiceCons:Online Play:1/10I have to give Nintendo SOME credit for trying at it, but it was not what it was hyped up to be.Basically you can send letters to others. Sounds fun, right?Well not really, since both sides need to have the code, and that isn't always easy to do.Side Quests:5/10I live for side quests. However, the only way to accomplish the side quests is to send letters. And I don't like how you can send one an hour. And I know you can change the time, but that will take longer than needed.Basically you cannot unlock anything without using this featureOverall:7.5/10Good difficultyGood plotDecent game"
2,Disappointed,I was hoping to play a game as good as Final Fantasy 6 which I enjoyed on the SNES. Instead I got a plot-less exercise in grinding with a final dungeon that finally put me over the edge. A complete waste of money. There are plenty of better DS RPGs like Chrono Trigger.
3,so so classic game,"The game is good for people that like rpg, and is a classic, very nice intro but nothing new in the gameplay, maybe just the FF series fans can enjoy it."
4,I didnt like it buy my bf did.,Its a strategic game and I really didnt like it. I thought it would be different but I had no idea. I gave it to my bf and he loved the game. It's one of his fav ff games right now.
2,Not an experienced player,"I'm not giving this game a single star because I don't think the game is no good. In fact, I understand that this is a great game by people who would know. However, I didn't understand what an RPG was (role playing game) when I bought it. What that seems to mean is that you have to tell your character what to do in any situation, ie, fight, run, etc. Personally I find this tedious, (I'm 47 and pretty new to this stuff). I understand that it's an ""old school"" technique that is really popular. If you don't know what RPG really means, ask a teenager. After they finish formatting your computer and showing you how your Wii works that is. lol"
4,Great Remake of a classic Final Fantasy RPG,"Pros- Great graphics, and great new feature of using the stylus for playing and going through your menus. I've had it for several weeks and it has been fun. I enjoy it alot. Battles are pretty quick and easy to control with the DS stylus feature.Cons- Leveling up is a bit slow and can get boring and tedious. Story line can leave you not completely sure where to go next.Overall I think it is a must have for any FF RPG fan."
3,A remake of an old game - and it shows,"Final Fantasy III is a good game, visually and audibly. It comes close to rivaling the graphical power of a game for the PS1. Almost, that is. Perhaps the next-gen handheld will look as good as the PS1.Gameplay-wise, this shows it's age. It's from an era when adventure game=wandering around for hours, leveling up your charachters with random encounters, and dying if you dared stray off the storyline path. Everything is turn based, and sometimes there isn't any real clear direction to go. Just...do this, but you die when you get there because you didn't spend hours wandering around, etc, etc.Overall, a decent game, but there are better ones out there. Pick this one up used if you want it."
4,The missing link,"It's finally here! The final fantasy game everyone thought they had played is here for the first time since its first appearance in Japan. Many final fantasy gamers will instantly think of the characters Terra and Kefka. This is the real FF III never released in the us Terra and Kefka are from FF VI. FF III introduces the job system which lets you change your characters costume and abilities. Some of the most recognizable ones are Black mage, white mage,thief, and warrior. It also allows you to chat with freinds via WIFI using mognet. Moogles of course run mognet and you can send ""e-mails"" to other FF III players as well as npcs ( non player controlled characters ). Over all this game is worth the money and time you put into it but if you get frustrated with the puzzles don't give up to easily just keep working at it. :0 : ) =D"
4,Final Fantasy,"like the game series, but i would like the old versions. the lower bitform gives a more retro feel that the remake 3d"
3,its a good shortish rpg,its a fairly decent rpg same as the other FF i like to play it in the car or on roadtrips as a distraction :)
2,not for unsupervised teen reading,"Careful reading reveals the author eliminating the parent as an authority with any rights. In this book, the author tells us that after a 15 yr old girl properly and carefuly consults with caring fellow teens and maybe a high school conselor, [parents exluded] it's fine for her to have sex with a guy for any well chosen reason, at any well chosen time, at any well chosen place. From boy to boy to boy ---. When she one day gets married, How Is She To Stop a Behavior She Has Made Such a Habit? Or will her modern husband care? Interesting world."
4,Great product,"Bought this processor with my new intel board, works great so far. Was also easy to install."
4,Excellent Album,"I didn't really know what to expect when I ordered this album. I was never that much of a fan of Glenn's earlier material, and knew him mostly from his songs in the Rankin/Bass Productions of THE HOBBIT and THE RETURN OF THE KING. I only ordered it because of the versions of 'The Greatest Adventure"" and ""Roads"" contained therein.But I was suitably impressed. :-) I particularly liked the songs ""No One's Gonna Hurt You"", ""Something To Adore"" (Holly's voice is beautiful. :-) ) and ""Fare Thee Well"", along with the afore-mentioned tunes, originally appearing in THE HOBBIT.Of course, the theme is a little ""New Age""y, and fans of Glenn's older stuff might not like it as much. Just a question of personal taste, I suppose."
3,Good for No Names,"When you first listen to the album, you instantly think its Karaoke. The instrumentation on some of the songs sound so much like the originals you think their just singing over them. Great renditions of classics like, Michelle, Love Is All We Need, and my favorite, Norweigen Wood. There's Jazz instrumentals of Nowhere Man and Strawberry Fields that are great. I also like the LSD Instrumental. Overall it's good work for bands I have never heard of. Pick it up."
1,For die hard collectors only,"Mainly note for note boring renditions, but with some nice surprises. A lovely ""Yesterday"" version on flute and guitar. ""Nowhere man"" goes on a ""theme and variations"" style. ""Sgt Pepper's"" picks the choral arrangement by the cast on that film by the Bee Gees and Frampton.The rest is predictable."
2,DO NOT BUY,"I bought this Vornado heater from Amazon.com about 3 years ago. Within the first year, the thermostat went out (producing too much heat) so I paid ~$25 shipping to return it to Vornado for repairs (no local authorized repair dealer). Over the past year (3rd year we've had it), we've had to turn the knob more and more toward the low heat setting to keep it from overheating. We've been using it on AF (fan only) for about 4 mos. now because it was overheating even when it was barely above AF. Last night, the smoke detector went off shortly after I turned the Vornado on in my daughter's bedroom. The Vornado, still on AF, was making a burning smell and smoking. This thing is going in the trash.I have an older model Vornado heater from 1993 that has worked reliably since I first bought it, so the problem may just be with this particular model."
2,disappointed,"Fan is a bit noisy, not recommended for sleeping in same room, quality is poor (fan rattles and top controls shake around a bit -- I'm returning it), 750 watt low heat seems to be enough so that's ok, thermostat works well, fan does cycle off with the thermostat (unlike their DVTH model), fan just too loud -- should be a low speed but sounds more like medium."
2,"This ""heater"" doesn't!","This heater doesn't heat. I had an older model Vornado that was great. Unfortunately, in the newer models the thermostat turns off at the highest setting even though the room is still quite cold. When the thermostat goes off the fan just circulates cold air. Freezing here..."
1,Waste of Money,"Honestly, I bought the Walmart model, which is #EH1-0025-01 and I may as well have used a fan. It didn't heat anything at all! Don't buy it! I'm returning it ASAP!"
3,Gideon,"Personally, I was not impressed by the book. Gideon, the maincharacter, was not very believable. I have a hard time believing thata normal fourteen year old boy would know how to smuggle guns and food into another city.However, the book wasn't all bad. It did have a lot of action during the middle and end. It also describes what life was like in a Jewish ghetto. I would recommend ""Gideon"" for young readers that enjoy serious books. END"
3,Gideon,I think this was an ok book. I think there could have been more detail. But over sll this is a good book to young readers who are easily intrested in the Holocaust.
4,gideon,I read this book when I was in junior high..I have been looking to read it again since I understand a little more about WWII and what happened to the jews. I really enjoyed this book when I was young.
1,No Power-Through Capability,I bought this cable thinking I would be able to charge my phone off the USB port on my computer. You can forget about that because it has no power-through capability. Bummer. Oh well. Into the recycling can it goes. Back to square one.
3,just an ok service,"I purchased this product because I needed to download pictures with great sentimental value that I took during a family trip. My digital camera ran out of battery so I used my cell phone. The product arrived very quickly but they didn't send a cd with the necessary program. I tried it anyway. It fits my old phone fine, but won't download the pics without it. I've sent a message to the company and I still haven't heard from them and of course haven't been able to download my pics and share them with my relatives. I ordered this cable over a month ago. Thumbs down for the service."
1,DON'T BUY THIS DVD,"Most of the Scholastic Video Collection DVDs that I have are really good, though some of them are truly excellent. The main stories tend to be better than the bonus stories, but a few of the bonus stories are on par with the features. This DVD has a collection of stories that are even BELOW the standard of the most mediocre bonus stories. Don't waste your money on this one. Opt for Pete's a Pizza, Chyrsanthemeum, Harry the Dirty Dog, and Is Your Mama A Llama?"
4,"Great stories, kids like it.","As with most of the scholastic videos, my kids enjoy watching this.My son especially likes to watch The Emperor's New Clothes and Swineherd.We have quite a few of these scholastic videos and this one is one of our most watched.The stories are longer in length, so I think it's more appropriate for preschoolers rather than toddlers."
2,First roads to California.,"Scholarly yes, dry absolutely. I know the author is a Professor, but you need to appeal to your readers. There was some good research into this book, and it is obvious the author traversed some of the roads himself. However, why not elaborate on some of the tales of those emigrants coming into California. This was a relatively short book, but it took me nearly four days for me to read. That said, the author explores new ground on the hardships of people going overland to California. This is a story that needs telling.This book is for those interested in California history. It is more focused toward the academic audience, and a general reader has to have a great desire to learn more about this subject."
2,Not Too Pleased,"For a failry expensive product, it fails to live up. To start with, it doesn't have an ""On/Off"" button, which means that you have to pull the plug out of the outlet everytime you're finished. The water level is extremely hard to see when filling, which invariably leads to one filling more than the required limit. On Auto steam, water gets depleted in around 10 mins of ironing. The power steam burst is quite weak as well. To be fair, I do have to say that the iron does a good job."
5,This really is a great table and chair set!!,I am a very picky shopper especially when it comes to things for my little girls. They are rough on furniture and toys like most kids but this table and chair set really is very sturdy and durable (which for the price is amazing)! Not to mention it is so pretty and perfect for a true princess room! It will last my 1 year old and 3 year old a long time!
3,Okay but can break easily. Bought 2 both broke.,"Length:: 3:06 MinsThis is a good product. However, caveat emptor (buy beware), the build of this product isn't the best. It's made of plastic and the part of the cord that is attached to your bracket can break very easily when your camera and flash are horizontal. The weight of the flash (and your diffuser) can break the plastic that keeps it in place.I recommend screwing this piece in place to a bracket such as theStroboframe Camera Flip Flash Bracket. Hope this review helps.[...]"
5,Works as expected on 30D,"Unlike the 3rd party brand off camera shoe cord, which did not work with some of the automatice flash functions, this product works great!"
3,Great item if you've got a third hand.,"Getting your flash off camera is crucial for natural looking lighting in many situations. Having to endlessly dismount the flash, mount the cord and finally attach the the flash to the shoe on the cord only to reverse the process when you want to put your flash back on the camera makes this otherwise priceless accessory tedious at best. It's not long enough for use with an umbrella so why does it not come with some sort of quick-release feature that will allow you to switch quickly from on camera to off?"
4,Does what it's supposed to,Does what it's supposed to. The price is a little bit on the costly side considering it's just a wire. Of cource it's needed if you are going to do off camera shoe flash photography with a dedicated Canon flash.
3,Great accessory-- until it breaks.... Part can be ordered,"This is a great accessory with one major flaw: eventually the flash end of the mounting shoe base breaks. It is made of plastic (and according to Canon is engineered to break/sacrifice the shoe vs the flash-- even tho one reviewer said he was able to just catch the falling flash before it hit the ground!) The plastic part may last a few weeks to a few years but, even the most carefully used will eventually break.Canon does have a replacement part. Canon Parts 1-866-481-2569. The replacement runs $3.73 + 6.00 ship + tax. Order two."
1,Needs a mounting screw,"The flash bracket end only has a screw hole for a tripod, useless when used with a typical flash bracket. As such, there's no way to security fasten the flash bracket end to the bracket, so it just keeps sliding out of the channel. Hey Canon, think before you design!"
4,Good piece to have....,but I agree with other reviews - should be more reliable - seems very flimsy and will have a short lifespan.
1,Sucked,No way to put in your own photo. The program was just the most basic throw together so they could collect your and my cash.
1,Incompatible,I bought this as an upgrade to Version 6. What a disappointment. It's worse and most of all it cannot open or import drawings from previous versions. It is simply incompatible.
2,Not intuitive,"To be fair, I haven't read the entire software manual yet, but right out of the box, I can't figure this out! What I have read of the manual has not been helpful, like, What is the difference between lot size and property line? I have had experience with MSDraw and other computer art programs, but this I can't figure out. I'm disappointed that it isn't easier. Maybe someone can recommend a good resource to learn how to use this."
1,3D Home Architecture,"The product came without a written ""how to"" Book. Difficult to utilize, and no clear idea as to how the landscape would look at any given time. But for $8 what do you expect?"
1,Miss led Again!,"I had a 3D architect a few years ago that I was happy with, but cannot find it anymore. this program tends to lead to landscapeing which I thougt would be a plus or a add on, but it is more of a landscape program not an architect program. I am not happy with it."
2,Nice but not real,I bought this because well it's a beautiful ring and looks so real. But after a week of wearing it my ring finger turned green. It's not real silver. I still think it's beautiful and the stones like so real but I guess you get what you pay for.
1,What a disappointment,"I don't understand all the raves for this CD, I was so disappointed when I listened to it. I've always liked John Barry's film scores but in this re-recording all life has been drained out of the music. Where's all the emotion, the excitement and pathos? Instead, every track sounds the same -- they're all filled with a melancholic boredom. Give me any of the original soundtracks over this ""easy-listening"" interpretation."
5,Beautiful and Epic music.,A must have for fans of film music. You will love this music as well as the movies themselves.
5,Love Early Soul Music? You'll Love This!,"The guys at the UK label Kent have delivered another winner here in the Birth of Soul series.Like the others in the series, you get a good mix of minor hits (""A Quiet Place"" by Garnet Mimms, ""Untie Me"" by the Tams), early sides by future stars (""Don't Feel Sorry For Me"" by Jimmy Ruffin, ""Shorty's Got to Go"" by the Impressions), early Northern soul sides (""The Palm of Your Hand"" by Chuck Wright), cult heroes like Carolyn Crawford and Billy Watkins, and obscure artists like the Taylor Brothers. My faves are the Tams track and ""Watch Your Step"" by Brooks O'Dell, but I'm sure after a listen or two, you'll have your own favorite tracks...and I'm also sure that you'd want the other volumes in the series as well!"
4,You are paying for a name...,"I bought these for $30 from Amazon and I love them but the reality is that you're paying for the Burberry name and trademark plaid case. They are just simple black plastic sunglasses. Why anyone would pay retail for them is beyond me. One thing that kind of irritates me is that the ends of the ear pieces dig into my head, but, then again, I have a big head so maybe it's me!"
5,Breathtaking & Memorable!,"This latest CD by Nicholas Gunn is undeniably different and reminiscent of his past recordings. With latin influences and world rhythms, it captures your imagination and takes you for an upbeat journey with visual sounds and melodies. You will find yourself far, far away from your everyday routine and captured in a most memorable experience that no other instrumental record could offer you to date! Enjoy it today and always!"
3,Bummer,"I bought his Grand Canyon National Park album, which I loved. I thought I'd give him another try and I must say I was disappointed, seems each song was like the last and it got pretty boring. I'll try some of his others because the guy had talent for sure!!"
5,Salmon Forest,Great story and beautifully illustrated with vibrant colors! It tells of the interconnection of all living things. I bought the hardcover edition for my grandkids whose father worked in Alaska at a salmon cannery for several years when he was younger. They will love it as much as they love eating salmon. I enjoyed the glossary in the back of the book and also the recipe that was included. Nice addition to the story.
2,Never will I Recommend this to Anyone,"We bought this as our old bag vaccum had to be discarded ....bought this from costco at agood price ....it wodrked well for hardly 6 motnhs and then the belt started to tore off ..we had to change atleast 3 belts in six months...it is worst and time comsuming and very heavy if u have to vaccum stairs......also the belts comes off soemtimes while vaccuming and then its the hurdle of fitting it back again and then starting the vaccum....as for the hepa filter located on the side of the vaccum, we never felt as if it is doing any job other than sitting there idly......and it looks new as ever always....then y the hepa filter tech.....dont buy this....vaccum..."
2,Not for Pets,"This vacuum while seemingly good at first, after use noticed pet hair not coming off the carpet. Hair seems to clog very easily in hose and filter compartment. The vacuum is very heavy up stairs and the power paw feature has only worked a couple of times. I would return if possible."
3,Its good but there are better in same price range,Got my vaccume within a week. I wasn't happy with the box looked like an old used vaccume first but inside was okay al the parts were unused I guess. The vaccume works good although it is very heavy to use. HEPA filter does good job. The vaccume is short on accessories. Stair cleaning can be more efficient and less work if they have longer extention hose. also it leave line marks on carpet sometime. This price range give you many options. If you have pets dont even think about it
2,Not What I Had Expected,"When I ordered this upright vacuum cleaner,it was a great buy! I may have overlooked some items which I would have liked in my new upright vacuum cleaner. This is my first upright vacuum ever, and I may have been going by price rather than the features and benefits. I do not like the fact it does not have a bag system - where when the bag is full you can replace it with another bag. Now I am faced with emptying out the dirt and dust onto the floor (which I have placed with newspaper to catch all of the ""stuff"" as I take it out). It does a good job of cleaning. However, the bag or lack of is a real turn off. If this was mentioned in the ad I did not read it, as I was looking at the price plus 'no shipping'!"
4,"Happy, Female Vocals, Indie Pop","It's a pity that the tracks can't be sampled, or even listed, at the time that I write this. The CD includes 11 songs, melodic, upbeat, with female vocals and harmonies, clever lyrics, with an unobstrusive background dash of 60's bubblegum style organ. Other bands that have some similarities to The Icicles include The Eames Era, Cub, & The Concretes, all of whose music can be heard on Amazon. If you're a fan of this type of music, I'd recommend The Icicles. Of the 11 songs, all are good and 5 or 6 have migrated to my mp3 player for long term listening."
5,"Senseo Douwe Egberts Medium Roast Coffee Pods, Decaffeinated, 18-Count 4.41-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)",The rich flavor and the convenient of automatic purchase and delivery makes the Senseo Decaffeinated coffee the right chose for me.
4,Wonderful Coffee,"I must respectfully disagree with the other reviewer. The Medium Roast coffee I received with my Senseo produces a teriffic cup of coffee. For a coffee shop like taste, go with the dark roast, but the Medium Roast is perfect for an every day morning blend."
5,Excellent!,"These are by far the best coffee pods! In my part of the world, I'm saving approximately $5.00 by purchasing them via Amazon."
1,Nasty smell,The aroma from the cup was so awful I did not venture drinking it. Tried a second pod with a different brew setting and it smelled just as bad. Tossing all in the trash- what a waste of money.
2,Decaf disapointment,I love the Senseo medium roast coffee. The decaf was said to be the same only without the caffine. So I was so excited to receive my order this weekend. However I was soon disapointed as it had a sort of burnt carmel flavor. I guess I will have to drink the caffine and limit myself because the whole reason to use coffee pods for me is to get a fresh cup every time; not one that tastes like it has burnt setting on a warmer too long.
4,Very Pleased,I really love the convenience of having automatic shipments; and signing up for this service enabled me to get a great price as well. It is terribly hard to find coffee pods in any of the grocery stores anymore and decaf is next to impossible to find. Thank you Amazon.com for providing the product I've been looking for.
5,"Quick Delivery, just what I ordered",Can't find these things anywhere in the grocery stores in the decaffeinated variety. Shipping was fast and my handicapped Mom didn't have to go to store after store looking for them.
5,Great coffee - great system,"Senseo makes it easy to have a very flavorful cup of coffee, as close to a latte as you can get without steaming the milk, in about 2 minutes. This is a great device and the coffe I have used from Senseo has been very flavorful and quite good. I usually use only one pod but make two cups - tends to keep it strong enough and flavorful enough without having to use two pods - and they last twice as long. Can't go wrong with their coffee."
3,Senseo Decaf - kind of weak,"These decaf coffee pods are getting hard to find in stores. They are convenient, but the flavor is pretty weak."
1,"I did not receive the medium roast, but instead I received various ""gourmet"" senseo coffees, with a few less pods in each packag","I did not receive what I ordered. Instead of medium roast senseo pods, I received various ""gourmet"" senseo pods, which had 16 pods in each bag, instead of 18."
2,Watered Down Taste,"I recently received my new Senseo single brew coffee machine, and eagerly brewed my first cup using 2 decaf pods, which is the medium roast without the caffeine. Also, because I wanted a full mug, I needed to use 2 pods. I was so disappointed to find it was very weak and tasted so watered down. I like a pretty strong cup of coffee. Definitely not in the espresso range, but this was WEAK and had almost no flavor. So, thanks to Senseo's generosity, to my relief and delight I found a complimentary 18-pod pack of the dark roast inside the box in which the coffee maker came. I took one pod of the dark roast and one pod of the decaf and combined them. This, I was hoping, would taste closer to how I like it while still only getting half the caffeine. And voila! It turned out perfect. Now, just add some hazelnut creamer and enjoy the garden with a great cup of freshly brewed coffee."
3,Tell me something I don't know,"This book won't tell you anything you probably haven't stumbled on before...grocery stores, book stores...working for big companies...see...you've probably already thought of more of them.But, it does provide some laugh-worthy ideas. My personal favorite is the one about putting out a $500 bounty with your friends for the person who fixes you up with your future spouse.I would say use a gift certificate for this book, but don't waste your own money on it. It tells you nothing you haven't already figured out, most likely."
3,Not bad,"One of my least favorite songs of The Crystal Method. However, track 1 and track 4 make this single worth the money."
3,DON'T BUY THIS TRICYCLE!,"Don't buy the hype. This tricycle is real nice but...Harbor Freight sells the exact same tricycle, only red for $59.99. You have to put this together and it not the easiest. You are paying for the name. At this price I expected it to be made in America - it's not."
2,a few problems,"I had to read the instructions to put this trike together and I would suggest to read them carefully because it would appear to be very simple but it's not. After that's completed, the handle bars loosened several times and took all my strength to get to the point that it didn't come loose again. after several weeks, it's been OK. So far! Also the pedal was always coming loose too. Once again with all my strength it finally tightened it. and it too appears to be OK. But....It's a wonderful trike, the kids love to ride it and for this reason i would recommend it, do to it's very well built steel construction and the air filled rubber tires. Most others are plastic and solid tires. and it's a john deer!"
4,JD Mom,"This will be a Christmas gift for my 3 yr old son. I cannot really rate it yet, but I'm sure he will absolutely love it."
2,The Tires REEK of Chemicals!!!,"This trike is fine in most of the ways it should be. The handlebar assembly is difficult to adjust & tighten properly, but that's par for the course these days.What is inexcusable is the stench of chemicals coming off the rubber (?) tires. How can no one else have mentioned this? Were ours the only tires made of material recycled from a toxic waste dump?I thought the smell would blow off, but now it's been almost 5 months with no abatement (in fact it's worse in warm weather!) making me REALLY wonder if i should let my kids ride this thing.A return at this point seems unlikely -- perhaps I should buy new tires? But at what cost!?"
2,"writes well, but...","I really want to give this pen and refills a 5 because they do write very smoothly, but here's the problem: they run out of ink so quickly. Not only that, with the amount of plastic used in the pen refill, one might as well buy a whole new pen. Other than liking the writing performance of this pen, the main reason I purchased something refillable was so that I would be reducing plastic waste. However, I think I would've been better off just purchasing the Pilot Precise V5 Rolling Ball pen instead. It probably contains about the same amount of plastic as 1 or 2 of these refills and lasts at least twice as long."
5,Another exciting bloodhound thriller,"The intrepid Jo Beth Sidden and her lovable, talented bloodhounds continue their daring exploits in this third suspenseful mystery of the series. This time our heroes deal with the kidnapping of a child, a murderous judge who's carrying on nefarious deeds in the woods, a bank robbery perpetrated by two drunken locals, and a rampaging alligator. And, yes, psycho ex-husband Bubba is still around. Add dangerous treks through the Okefenokee Swamp and stakeouts in the forest, and you've got an absorbing, unputdownable thriller. Unconventional characters, exciting subplots, vivid descriptions, humor, Southern atmosphere and, above all, those irresistible canines make for a most enjoyable read."
4,Nude re-release,"I bought this CD set from Amazon without reading the track listing. The majority of the songs in this set were also in Nude. (The chronology is a bit funny -- the tracks were first released on the net, then turned into Nude, then collected again to form this set). The point is, this isn't a double set of new songs. Look before you leap."
4,Refreshing and just as powerful,"I've always loved VAST since I discovered the music 9 years ago. Jon Crosby's self titled album was my favorite. When ""Music For People"" came out I was a little disappointed because it wasn't as emotionally charged, lyrically beautiful, and musically creative as the first. Then I picked up ""Turquoise and Crimson"" and it revived my faith in this band's talent. Songs like ""Dead Angels"" and especially, ""Where It Never Rains"", leaves you with a deep and soulful feeling. I don't find it to be VAST's best but it's definitely worth listening to and has a different, but just as impacting, sound as the first."
3,"Worth the Money, Not VAST Best","It's like someone talk Jim into putting all the material he wasn't quite happy with on a 2-CD set. And if you're a big fan of VAST, like me, you'll find songs like Turquoise, Dead Angles, Desert Garden, Winter in my Heart, and Senorita are excellent, while the rest of the tracks are redeemable, but not Jim at his best. Still, the 2-Album Set is worth the money."
2,Boring,"While earlier VAST was interesting and engaging, this collection of songs doesn't go anywhere or do anything. It was, at times, torturous to listen to. Hopefully, further VAST CDs will contain some sort of emotional content."
1,Soldier's view,"Mr.Corbett did a good job putting me there with him during his 77 days of hell. This was not meant to be a story about Khe Sanh but a personal account of a young man's terrifying ordeal at Khe Sanh. Yes,the book is full of 'short choppy sentences' but it is not a history lesson. Mr. Corbett's intimate details are a must read for all Americans who just don't have a clue what Vietnam Vets endured both during and after serving."
4,High School Acquaintance,"I went to high school with Jack Corbett 40 years ago so I'm a little biased. Still, I could picture him as he took us with him through the Battle of Khe Sanh. His prose is short and brutal, but brings his experience of battle to the reader's hands and heart. Yet through the terror of battle, he never gives up hope, even when covered in the brain matter of one his compatriots. His book is a testimony to the men of the Marine Corps, who live and die by their motto of ""Semper Fidelis, Always Faithful""."
1,hate it,The spy tracker is not great and not even good! the range is terrible you are out of range if you stand across the street i do not like this
4,Step by Step learning of chinese,"The cassettes give a very good start of learning the spoken chinese. It starts really at the bottom line. Hearing the pronounciation of different native speakers and then pausing for yourself to rehearse what was said, followed by a direct feedback for your own pronounciation. I used the cassetes in my car when driving from and to work and I am amazed by the speed, I learned the basics of Chinese."
3,there there,"book in good condition, information in the book is information you can mostly find on the internet if you had topic or titles to help you along the way. It is worth to buy if you do not want to search the internet for the information, and have to print or write stuff out all the time. Some information is useful but most of it you find online. As in it elaborates as if you searching it up online. At least it a good start in the topic."
1,BEWARE!!! Follow your own heart.,"I use to have a belief that ""psychics"" could actually tap the ""Truth"" from the other side. But after paying $200 for a reading from Echo Bodine, I now strongly doubt it. She gave me completely INCORRECT answers, which caused me harm physically.At this point, I don't believe you should EVER pay for spiritual truth. If someone is charging you, they are taking advantage of you. Follow your own instincts and your own heart!!!!If she is wrong in a reading -- how accurate are her books??"
3,The Gft Understand and Develop Your Psychic Abilities,Helps for understanding my gift but if you don't have a group of people to work with not much help for development.
4,Interesting,I had a good time reading this book. I found it to be very informative. It was also easy to read.
4,Great but one problem.,The thing about this book is that it makes it seem like if you use tools in your work then your not a psychic. Some of the best psychics I know use divanation tools. Theres nothing wrong with the tarot astrolgy i ching or reading palms. Its like anything else in life. We cant cut wood without a saw. We cant boil water without heat. Same concept. Other than that its a all together great book.
4,GPS is what I needed.,"This item is the very basic of GPS mapping. I have been to two different lakes with this device and it gives only the outline of the land mass, it does not show underwater obstructions, roads, bridges, Marinas, just the basics. I wanted a GPS device that shows me the shore lines so when I am fishing at night I will not run my boat aground and that is what it does. I use lake maps for the rest. You do not have to download any maps with this device.The vertical sonar,fish finder, water temperature, boat speed, longitude and latitude all works great.If you are looking for a GPS that is more detailed with mapping capabilities, this device is not for you, but if you just need a basic GPS to keep from running aground at night it works just fine."
5,Understanding Theology Volume 2,"Very pleased and a welcomed addition to my library.It is easy to read, easy to understand, obviouslywritten with inspiration, and I will be ableto use this book to teach from often."
3,Short but interesting...,"This brief book gives a few interesting insights into the spiritual significance of certain aspects of Hawaiian quilt design. It would have been nice to see more examples explained this way, and to have included more traditional examples in addition to the authors' own designs."
1,One of the most bogus books ever written,"This is a pure scam by some compete idiot claiming to be ""Jesus"" who should be put into a mental institution immediately. This guy has no idea what he is talking about except putting out lies in the form of ""autobiography"". One other reviewer has pointed out various faults, along with which I would like to add, the state of ""Orissa"" did not exist at that time, where this fraud claims to have gone. I don't know what kind of ""authentic"" research was carried on. But this guy is definitely in the long line of fake writers just to fool some people and make money."
1,How low can I rate this?,I won't waste too many words describing this woeful effort. New age mumbo-jumbo passed off as the life story of the Messiah will not and cannot fly. If only I could have given it a lower rating!!
1,Response to Carolg23,"I can't speak for everyone who gave it a low rating, but I know that the reason I did was not because it was a non-traditional view of Jesus. I'm all in favor of new views. I gave it one star because of all the flaws I mentioned earlier."
4,Controversial - definitely. Enjoyable - DEFINITELY,"Now I understand the controversy about this book. I see the reviews have ranged between 10 and an unrealistic 1. I have to say I came down on the 'pros'. This is a very challenging novel at many levels. You know how you can watch a movie and ten minutes later can't even recall the plotline and yet movies like Schindler's List reverberate for days after?! Well this Autobiography is STILL resonating. I wanted to give it a 10 but can see that I would be considered one of the 'Conspiricists' that an earlier review seemd to think were colluding on this book, so I'm giving it a reluctant 8. Loved the book, hope the author has more in the works."
4,Flawed but Captivating and Thought-Provoking,"Once you get into it, it's definitely a page-turner. Not only that, but it will shake up your concept of Christianity--and for the better, I think.The writing problems, unfortunately, interfere with the flow a bit. But, despite these and other flaws, the book presents Christ in a way that haunts you.Personally, I have an easier time believing the essence of THE Autobiography than what I find in the Bible, which seems to have been scrubbed, sanitized and ""reinterpreted"" for the benefit (?) of furthering a cause."
5,THE Autobiography is a revelation - and great reading!,"After 2000 years, you would expect that everything that could have been told about Jesus the man, had been said. Wrong! Richard Patton has produced a fresh and convincing portrait that is spell-binding and no less than a compulsive page-turner."
4,I love Old Universal Monster Movies,"Truth be told, the movie lingers with Mr. Talbot's horrible affliction, but I like having this movie in my collection."
3,"Lon Chaney is great, Bela is not a good Frankenstein","This had to be the easiest script for Lugosi to perform in his career, he grunts, growls and yells; a classic Universal release which just spit out monster movies like watermelon seeds in the 30's and 40's. I feel obligated to give it an 'OK' because they made plastic models out of these characters, which I doubt Lugosi and Chaney saw a nickle."
3,"Lon Chaney great as Wolfie, Lugosi so-so as Frankie","Great scenery and imagery in cemetery like the first two Frankensteins, but Lugosi as the Monster left a little to be desired, not as ""human"", not as nuanced as Karloff's portrayals. The good thing was that you get more Wolfman than Frankenstein in this one, and with Lugosi'd Monster, that's a good thing. Best scene just might be the entire ""New Wine Festival"" of the villagers, but Lugosi's lumbering Monster in the scene is laughable (watch as he TRIES to kick the wine barrels off the getaway cart driven by Lon Chaney)."
5,Both were fabulous!!,"This is a sequel to two films. The prequels are: Ghost of Frankenstein and the Wolf Man. Fabulous horror from beginning to end. Later in the film, the resurrected wolfman digs out Frankenstein's superhuman monster, who still stands tall and strong after being burnt and blown up so many times. Coolest!! I have no favorites out of the dozens of great horror classics made way back, and this a wonderful clash. I won't ruin anything else for you, so enjoy...."
4,A GREAT MONSTER BASH !,"This movie is great, it is a great adittion to the classic Universal Monsters collection. It's got a quicker pace, a better story, and more excitement than some other monster movies like Dracula and House of Dracula. I recommend this to anyone who likes the monster of Frankenstein or the Wolfman because this has both! This is one of my favorite Universal Monsters movies. Get the popcorn and Pepsi it's starting!"
4,wish they make more movies like this,"i t hink the classic universal frankenstein has been played 4 times by different actor's....karloff...is a classic, but i likeglen strange from abbot and costello better.this movie good for a saturday afternoon..!"
3,Sequel to both GHOSTS OF FRANKENSTEIN and THE WOLFMAN,"There's plenty of thick-headed dialogue and corny scenes but who cares! This is an enjoyable horror flick with Lon Chaney Jr. fabulas as the Wolfman (and Bela Lugosi hilariously dumb as Frankenstein's monster). Larry Talbot (The Wolfman) is dead until he gets risen. Meanwhile, the Monster is walking all over the place shouting for some unknown reason. Anyway, sfter awhile thet both find eachother, start fighting but guess what? A tidal wave comes along, washes them along and spoils the match, that's what I really don't like about this film."
2,Low volume,Just isn't loud enough to overcome the distance to the ear and wind noise above 60mph in a fullface.I bought an in ear phone with mic and it works much better.
1,Low Volume and Bad design,"I use this in a full face helmet and I have 2 issues with this product. First the volume is way too low, I can not hear any phone calls. Also when using it for music on my iPhone I can barely hear the music going 50-70MPHs. The other issue is the connector at the helmet is a big block and it does not feel good against your neck. I had to keep adjusting the cable while riding which isn't safe. This also does not allow you to switch the headphones out for better ones unless you cut the cord. The cord is almost too short if you have a handlebar mount for your phone. The cord needs to be about a foot longer for this setup."
4,Nice product,"The headset is easy to install and is very simple to use. It is great when riding at lower speeds, but speakers could be louder highway speeds. It may just be my helmet though. I have recommended this product to others."
5,"Practical, comfortable, and stylish backpack","I was looking for a backpack to replace my old Targus laptop backpack, and bought this a month ago from for only $14 (at CircuitCity.com after rebates) - it is easily worth far more. It is a very well-designed and stylish backpack. It has several separate zippered compartments, and the section for the laptop keeps it well protected. There is plenty of room for power adapters, a mouse, MP3 players,and other accesories, in addition to extra clothes and a water bottle. The padded straps make it very comfortable, and the backpack distributes the weight well so that it doesn't feel that heavy even when loaded. Alternately, it is easy to carry by the top handle, which is very solid (reinforced). You can also stand the bag up due to the solid base."
2,Not sharp picture quality-,"The quality of this set is slightly out of focus. I don' think its my dvd player or Blu-Ray player. I tried the set on both of them. No excuse for this; Its taken a long time to get it out to us. CBS is starting to worry me with this and Hawaii Five-0 (season 10).Has anyone else had this problem with Season 4, Volume 1?"
2,Unacceptable DVD quality,"Have I purchased a cheap pirated version or is this what passes for a studio quality release? Give me a break. Are my wife and I are hostages to this awful vertical blur on the entire season, just because we're big fans of the show? We rented the first 3 seasons from Netflix and there was no quality issue at all. What the hell?When I purchased the ""brand new"" Forth Season Volume 1 from Ebay, I had to return it, because I thought it was just a bad pirated copy. Then we bought volume 2 from a different supplier and experienced the same thing. How could CBS do this to their customers. We continue to watch the episodes because we love the show. But the quality truly sucks!"
1,picture quality as bad as hawaii 5-o season 10,Not only was 90% of the episodes as boring as hell...the quality of the dvd was just as bad as what cbs paramount did to hawaii 5-0 season 10. The previous seasons were beautiful to watch as was the strong stories. Fist half of fourth season has just a few strong stories with the bulk limp-wristed or poor attempts at mild comedy.Only Bonanza pulled off comedy real well while maintaining strong stories. If the second half of season four is as poor my collection will end with that season. gunsmoke however is quality dvds season after season and powerful stories. ...by the way where is Bat masterson and Lawman?Bloodspiller: Book One: Warriors of Palahia Series
5,Sigh!,"As always, Rawhide features two of the handsomest men ever filmed, Eric Fleming and Clint Eastwood.Reason enough to watch."
5,Really good purchase,"These little wire drill bits are perfect for miniature work. The price was/is excellent and they were delivered quickly. I WILL use this company again, especially since I cannot find multiples of those bits that are smaller than sewing thread! If you shop around, you will find that you end up at Amazon. Don't buy the first one you see, as the cheaper one is further down the page. It cost me a mere $2 and change. THAT is a REAL bargain. Now then, go buy several. ;o)"
4,under false pretences,"The wealthy heiress, Carole Van Moren, founded the hospital in Majorca and appointed Luke Hallward as its director. Unfortunately, she felt her status gave her lifetime rights over Luke and his activities. The arrival of the unexpectedly attractive young surgeon, Amanda Verne, certainly didn't fit in with Carole's future plans--or Lukes!"
4,"Purchased as a gift, but it is adored!","I bought this as a housewarming gift for a dear friend of mine who is a tattoo artist. But before I wrapped it, I couldn't resist taking a peek inside. The book is thinner than I expected, but still fantastic for the coffee table.What really makes it impressive is the collection of stunning pictures... each large, vivid, and crystal clear. Absolutely beautiful shots of body art.The recipient loved it, and the book was passed around at the party all evening."
3,"Good, but thin","THis is a good gloss over of tattoos. But, there isn't a whole lot of content. I think what I was looking for is a picture book of tattoos."
5,Well done reference book for Military Horologists.,"Well done reference book for Military Horologists. It is the first illustrated guide devoted specifically to the highly collectable field of military watches and clocks. Covers deck watches, pocket, wrist and clocks. Current prices are provided (in Sterling) for timepieces covered. This book is highly recommended to all fellow military timepiece collectors! -- Chris, chronometer.net"
5,Wall of Death,"I found this book in the ""english"" section of a bookstore in Grindlewald and it was my introduction to the facinating world of mountaineering through literature. I have read many similir books since and nothing compares to this series of harrowing tales that progresses from the earliest climbs, through the first successful climb in the 30's and on to the stories of the worlds finest climbers and their attempts on this infamous wall. I was afraid to sleep after reading the Kurtz chapter it was so utterly depressing."
3,Phytoestrogen is not estrogen,"While a woman may get some benefit from phytoestrogens, they are not estrogens. Plant-analog estrogens, which are not bio-identical to human estrogens, may help relief hot flashes, but are unlikely to prevent vaginal atrophy/dryness. This product should not be advertised as estrogen at all."
5,Incredible!!!,"I speak very little Spanish, and understand even less. However, I love to listen to Spanish music. The first time I heard a Pepe Aguilar song I became obssessed with finding out who he was. After asking a co-worker who he was, I ran out that night and bought this CD, and Por Mujeres Como Tu. In the past 3 months, I must have listened to this CD more than 100 times. It is the most beautiful, heart felt, incredible, awesome CD EVER recorded!!! I can not say enough how this man and his music have touched me. Pepe's voice is in my opinion the most awe inspiring I have EVER heard in ANY language. I now own 4 of his CD's."
5,LO MEJOR DE LOS MEJORES EN UN DISCO.,"Sencillamente IMPRESIONANTE, lo mejor de CAMILO SESTO, NAPOLEON, JOSE JOSE, en la magnifica voz de PEPE AGUILAR, un cd que NO DEBE FALTAR EN TU COLECCION, para esos momentos de TRANQUILIDAD Y DE AMOR,, nada como este cd.A MUST HAVE CD, a TRIBUTE to CAMILO SESTO, NAPOLEON, JOSE JOSE, in the magnun voice of PEPE AGUILAR, the Best for your collection, in a MIX of love and tranquility, this is a must...that you can't miss."
4,"Classic Latin Ballads recorded ""Balada Ranchera"" Style","Classic ballads recorded in the past by Jose Jose, Emmanuel, Camilo Sesto and others are sung by Pepe Aguilar with ""Mexican Ballad Style"" arrangements. A worthy succesor to Pepe's ""Con Mariachi/Por Mujeres como tu"" CD."
2,No very stable,"Purchased this stroller for a 27 lb dog. It is not very stable. If she moves to one side or the other it is hard to keep the stroller straight. You must keep both hands on the stroller to keep it going straight. It moves dramatically when the road dips and changes. It would be much better with regards to the steering and stablility if it had four wheels. Not sure a 60 lb dog would fit. Also, small rocks in road make indents into the plastic tires."
4,Probably best on market--Like it,"Just put this stoller together tonight. Overall, I think it is a very good stroller, certainly much better quality than most pet strollers. I also like the appearance and it pushes easily and smoothly. There's plenty of room for my pomeranian. I'm not certain it can safely hold 50 lbs as has been suggested. I think it will do very well for my needs ( a pup with a broken leg that's on the mend) And it will be of use after he's healed too. I would agree with others that have said the instructions are not well written. Also, I was totally unable to attach the tray (not really a biggie), not because of an inability to figure out how it should be attached, but because it is going to be extraordinarily difficult to snap on--maybe slight design issue."
2,Wheel wobbles & zipper tore up on 4th use,"This stroller looks great and SEEMED to be well made. However, the second time we used it the wheel started wobbling. The zipper was really difficult to manipulate and tore up the 4th time we used it. Reluctantly, I would not recommend this product."
4,Handle extension,"The handle for this stroller is not comfortable for people taller than 5'4"". I am 5'5"" and could use an extended handle because my feet want to hit the brake bar, would be nice if the stroller gave you that option to adjust the handle length. My 2 dogs both ride well in this stroller and really seem to enjoy it. Good quality and easy assembly."
3,Good for 4 months!,"I have had this stroller for four months now. I use it at least once a day and up to today I have been very happy with it. However, Today I noticed that the screen material is tearing at the zipper. Once this tear spreads, the stroller will be of no use as it will not contain my dog. I am disappointed that after only four months, this would happen. I cannot afford to by a new stroller every four months and I was hoping for a little more durability. So that is why it gets only 3 stars from me. The stroller itself is well designed but the screen material is already tearing. So if you are looking for this to last, I would look elsewhere!"
4,Comfortable,"I'm basically leaving the stroller open for my cats to use as a lounger/sleeper on a regular basis to allow them to be comfortable in it. If and when an emergency does arise where I have to take them all out of my home, all I have to do is put my dog in a small carrier, put that into the stroller."
1,Entirely Pets Price is Misleading,Price: $449.98Sale: $199.99You Save: $249.99 (56%)No one sells this item for $449.98. Entirely Pets 'sale' of 56% is bogus!
1,Cheap product for a high price- try this one instead,"If you're buying junk, why pay so much? Try this stroller instead. It has reflective strips to protect your pet at night. It's comparable quality but it's $80 lessBeige Pet Jogger Stroller"
2,Disappointing,"I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed at the content of this book. I purchased it with the intention of giving it as a gift to a European friend I'll be visiting soon. I wanted to give my friend an overview of what my state looks like. Unfortunately, while the photographs are nicely done and the quality is excellent, the shots are mostly just closeups of people involved in various activities. There are very few photos of the state's scenery - the pictures could have been shot almost anywhere."
4,Great Find!,"I found this book in my mother's basement and I absolutely love it. I have found it very inspirational. I am 42 and I love running but have never gotten further than 3-6 miles per run. I have surpassed that and am training for a 1/2 marathon mostly because of the motivation I am receiving from this book. I relate to the authors experience and am having fun comparing the 70s viewpoint to today's views on the sport. I actually do think running is a total metaphor for my life experience and this book is strengthening that awareness, and therefore affecting other areas of my life positively. I only gave 4 stars because some info is dated (even though I find the dated stuff fascinating) and I haven't totally finished the book yet.Happy reading and running!"
2,pointless,Henning is just an average runner who for some reason thought he was qualified to write a book. He has no original content and his Sheehan-esque running-as-a-metaphor-for-life philosophy is crap. Read Lydiard or something.
1,Nasty,"Nasty tasting stuff. No wonder it was on sale.In fairness, I am a fan of Carb Boom--just not this flavor."
1,Prince John Magruder by Paul Casdorph (1996),"An account in To the Gates of Richmond by Stephen W. Sears (1992) of Prince John's tactics of illusion in the Penisula Campaign led me to seek a biography of Maj. Gen. John Bankhead Magruder. I found only one and was not disappointed: Prince John Magruder by Paul Casdorph (1996). There is not even a listing for him in my World Book encyclopedia. But the author gave a limited account of the important charade which substantially deterred Maj. Gen. George Brinton McClellan and his Federal army in its march toward the Confederate capital of Richmond. Magruder's flair, as descibed by the author, was perhaps unequalled, excepting Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart, of course. All in all, Casdorph's attention to detail, based upon exhaustive research, is sure to please fans of this mostly overlooked Confederate general: the hero of the Battle of Galveston, where he fired the first shot. None of which I would have known without reading this marvelous biography."
5,Fisker Paper cutter,"This is the second of these I have purchased and, as the first one, is great - nice clean cuts every time."
5,Best TRIZ introduction available.,"This is the best introduction to TRIZ available. H.Altov (G.Altshuller) explain many aspects of TRIZ, but don't expect to become a TRIZ master with only this lecture. I recommend this book for those TRIZ is a new subject. Engineers! It's a must have!"
3,"And Suddenly the Inventor Appeared: TRIZ, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving","Unfortunately I did not enjoy this book to the extent that other readers have. The subject of TRIZ (The Russian acronym for the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) is quite fascinating, and I look forward to learning more. It was my opinion that since this book was written by the man who developed this idea, that it would be my best source for learning the material.What I found was that a number of the solutions presented were either wrong by my experience, or would not be practical to implement in most situations. It is possible that things were lost in translation from the original Russian version of the book to the English version.What disturbed me the most is that it seemed the author was talking down to his readers; this too may have been due to translation. As a result, I found this book very difficult to read, and is not one I would personally recommend."
3,"A good introduction to TRIZ, but not the best synthesis of knowledge","The book starts with good examples, and is definitely interesting to read. However, I am not convinced by the way Genrikh Altshuller has synthesized his experience and knowledge. The contents of the book can definitely transform a good inventor to a better inventor, but that's about it. The claims and propganda about TRIZ on the world wide web are far mor exaggerated, as a reader with critical thinking skills (aka reading with open mind) will quickly realize after reading this book."
2,"cute, but...","If you order this item as I did, you will receive one potato-- not three. I didn't expect an entire sack full for less than two dollars, but did expect to receive three as advertised in the photo! The potato itself is about 2"" long, so won't take up much space in your child's limited kitchen storage space."
2,Tiny - yes I know play food is tiny,"Wow, was my shock on opening the package I received. Its one potato, that was almost lost due to size. I literally thought I was shipped an empty package. It is cute, but my problem with it is I think my daughter is going to think it just looks like a brown egg, due to size. I sure wish I could find a better potato. Its also pricey so the quality and size make it off and not worth the price.Guess I'm stuck with a brown egg..."
1,Only ONE?!?,"The picture is misleading. It's an adorable toy but I was expecting three, not one. It should be clear in the picture, not just the fine print."
1,Picture shows 3 but only get one and it looks like wood,"I do not like, I would not reccoment and the picture is deceiving, looks like a lump of wood- Id buy the bag of felt ones had I known I was only getting one and I dislike it."
2,"Doesn't color most gray, normal hair still gets this bronze tint","I tried JFM and then decided to try this one given that they say it won't stain leave the orange hues (like JFM does). This takes longer, I still got the bronze hues in my hair, and most of the grays were not ""blended away"" in minutes as the box promises."
3,Not as Good as previous works,"I've loved most of James Burke's Works, but found this one to no be quite up to the standard of his other works. Still a good read."
4,"More of the same, but that's good!","Fans of Burke's previous books (such as myself) will find this another fine, idiosyncratic volume of ""connections"", following the threads of science, technology, and discovery; the uninitiated may find this one, with its smaller and less dramatic scope, less appealing than ""Connections"" or ""The Day the Universe Changed"" or even ""The Pinball Effect"". It's less pedantic than ""The Axemaker's Gift"", though, and makes for a more leisurely and enjoyable read. Recommended."
2,Burke is trying too hard,"After producing the marvelous and engaging series ""Connections"", Burke seems to have gone to the well one to many times with ""Circles"". Burke trys to take his 'Connections' approach to identify complete circles in the connections of history. But rather than taking the connections where they lead, this self-imposed, artificial constraint leads to a combination of wild leaps and tidy little packages that just doesn't ring true. Burke comes out looking like he's just trying too hard, and a reader who's really paying attention will just refuse to follow.Okay, there are some curious and interesting historical connections identified here, but it's just too hard to follow Burke's route just to glean a few gems."
1,six degrees of historical separation,"In this book there seems to be no notion of causality in history; Burke just meanders from person to person, invention to invention. I loved both Connections and The Day the Universe Changed on The Learning Channel, but this book did not measure up to those. I was very disappointed."
4,"nice, but not great","My switch feels ""mushy"". the detents are nor as hard as I'd expected and it is very easy to have the switch slightly off the ""fully engaged"" position. My switch is also slightly mis-aligned, the marker notch on the blue handle doesn't quite line up with the colored markers on the background.Movement is smooth and it is simple to see the switch setting from a distance.The terminals on the back are mostly simply labeled as ""battery 1"" and ""battery 2"" but the ""feed' lug should be called ""output"" IMO. lugs are very large, both in diameter and length and include split lock washers."
5,Well made,"Top notch, use it for dual batteries in my truck. Been in for over a year now and no problems."
3,An excellent presentation on bombing of Hiroshima.,"I am in the fourth grade and read Hiroshima for a study class on World War II. It is mostly fact, and very informative.I recommend this book to anyone studying World War II, fourth grade and up."
4,Good,Arrived way earlier than they said it would and it arrived in great shape definitely cheaper than buying it from the store
4,Lofty to The Rescue,This little hard back book may be small but it is big fun for little ones. My 4 year enjoys the TV show and now he can take Bob the Builder along with him. The inside is not only a peek a boo but a pop-up as well which holds their attention and adds more fun to this cute well written book. My son just love it and I am ordering more for birthday gifts. I would recommend it to you and your small ones.
2,"Ok, at best","I had high hopes for this case. It is solidly constructed, but there are a few flaws. I was constantly afraid that it would pop open because of the week clasp that keeps the case closed. Also, it wasn't completely straight/square around the phone screen making it look like the phone wasn't sitting right. Admittedly, it was just aesthetically annoying, but nonetheless, an expensive case like this should be basically perfect."
1,Poorly Presented,"I have Super Reviews on both Physics and Chemistry. These are poorly written, poorly presented, and wrought with errors. In my opinion, they are a waste of money. The layout format seems to have been cranked out by a word-processor that is ill fitted to professional publishing. I would recommend ""Cliffs Quick Reviews"" or ""Teach Yourself Books""."
5,In our coming or in our going....,"People are always glad to see us; sometimes in our coming and sometimes in our going. After reading this book, I reflected on specific times in my life when ""I reached out to help someone in need"". I shutter at the thought of how my words and actions may have only contributed to another person's pain. This book should be required reading for all of us. If we interact with people in any way, we will have opportunities to encourage their healing or encourage their pain. I want people to be glad to see me coming."
5,A guys game,"This is only for guys, hence the name. It's a trivia game and the more you answer right the more revealing the game gets. AWESOME!"
1,one of the WORST games i ever played in my life!,"this game is one of the worst games i ever played in my life! and i played the SMURFS on playstation! even the theme is bad. answer questions to see girls flash? how lame is that! very BORING! this game is just like watching street smarts on tv. and the theme is supposed to be, to see girls naked in a game? NO! this game is like watching street smarts and howard stern! boring theme, and the nudity is CENSORED? if they censor it why do they put nudity in there in the first place? theres no point of playing a game that mentions (girls get naked) and its always censored anyways. just like howard stern, i would tell howard stern, ""theres no point of watching a show with nudity if its always censored anyways."" if theres any nudity in the game at all, its CENSORED by either scrambling the picture of the boobs or covering them with ""the guy game logo."" definely NOT worth the $40. worst game i ever played. i would rather play JEOPARDY than play this!"
1,Why is it okay to degrade/hate Women?,"Idiotic game that rewards you by humilitaing women. Misogyny should be considered a hate crime like any other ~ but that's not going to happen as long as men get off on it and make other men more money.If you buy this game, you seriously need to reevaluate your life.Waste of money on this one....unless you have some prejudice you need to vent on the opposite sex."
3,Works,"It works but not as well as the awful chemical kind. But would purchase again. Does the job, but just takes a bit longer."
2,A disappointment,"When I buy a CD because of one song, I expect to find a few others I like as well. Not so here. The title song, Que Sera Sera, is the only one I do not find excessively ""la-di-da"". In addition, the remakers did an atrocious job of creating fake stereo on the title track, and on a few others. It's earsplitting, if you listen on headphones. Stereo should remain stereo, mono should remain mono. Those who re-issue old material need to learn this lesson."
1,49er College Concepts Women's NFL Foxy Girl Panty,The elastic seperated from the panty after a couple of washes. I was very disappointed.
2,"fun, but there is a problem","I just purchased this toy for my daughter (age 5) who loves bugs. She enjoys playing with it and it is easy to put the pieces together. However, it is rather difficult to pull them apart. She had to get my help several times and I had to pull rather hard to get the pegs out of the holes. On a couple of occasions, the peg that was supposed to be attached to one piece got stuck in another piece when trying to pull the pieces apart and my husband actually had to use a pliers to extract it."
3,A little flimsy,"I repaired the pegs on this toy twice since Christmas. The pegs get stuck inside and require hard work, small pliers and a magician for recovery. My kid only plays with it occasionally but she really likes it so that's the only reason I haven't returned it. I just wish it was better quality."
1,"Not easy to use, not enough parts","My almost 3-yr-old got this as a gift. The pieces are almost impossible to put in and remove (or they are too loose), and there aren't nearly enough parts to make any good bugs. For example: the red ""beetle"" body has places to put 4 feet, but the feet provided are too fat to fit on the body. Only two will fit, and the bug tips over. This was not a well-thought-out toy."
4,Not for 2yrs,"I really liked this toy and would rate it 5 stars, but it really isn't for a two year old as recommended. The connecting pieces are way to small and intricate and hard to put together and pull apart for a two year old. However, my daughter loves it when I make her bugs to play with and I think when she is older she will be able to make her own bugs, but that won't be until she is at lest 3. Also, even though there are 21 pieces you can only really make two good bugs at a time. There aren't enough wings, feet, and eyes to go around. I would recommend pairing it with the sea, or flying bonz kits."
5,Interesting book,"The companion to this book (Why Buildings Stand Up) was a textbook for one of my classes when I was in architecture school in the 80s. I still have my old, dog-eared copy on my bookshelf in my office. I purchased this book, along with a new edition of Why Buildings Stand Up, to give to an 11-year-old (super intelligent) friend who would like to be an architect. I was worried that it might be too complex for him, but his mom assured me that it would not be."
3,good read,"Easy to drop this book in a couple of hours and know the main reasons for building failures. A good companion for residential construction is ""Building Failures"" by Ransom."
3,"A Good Book, but Outdated","I'm hopeful that the authors will produce a new edition of this book, with the forensic explanations of the collapse of the World Trade Center towers explained in detail.It is, nonetheless, a worthy sequel to Prof. Salvadori's great work, ""Why Buildings Stand Up."" It's best to buy both and read them in sequence.It's also fun to cross the New River Gorge Bridge in West Virginia (as my son and I did last summer) and think about Galloping Gertie...:)"
4,Fascinating case studies,"An entertaining book for readers who know about structures, and an educational book for lay readers, WHY BUILDINGS FALL DOWN is an interesting collection of case studies concerning building failures. Never condescending, but never too technical, it's a fun way to learn about architecture or structural engineering."
5,Great Read for parents,"I was impressed by Bob's knowledge on the subject and encourage parents to read this book. As a parent, coach, and avid sports fan, this book will help all keep it in perspective.I've witnessed some crazy behavior from parents and I like the way Bob has shed light on this for growing problem. I've since spoken to him and he was more than eager to take the time and share his thoughts.I'd recommend this to anyone who has an interest in attending youth sporting events. Great Read."
5,performance sand belt,"This is the best sand belt so far I've used past 4 years on my Makita 3"" belt sander. It removes material fast and last long. I've tried many other brand but this is the winner. Another good point is it does not leave sand mark on the wood surface. So all I need is just do finish sanding with 220- or 400-grit palm sander.This is not cheap but worth the money.Highly recommended."
3,Lasted a little longer than some others but not much,Used this today for the first time and I was expecting great things. The belt did last a little longer but not much and I was just sanding a flat perice of wood. Belt seemed to last a little longer than just steadily broke up.'Not impressed so far for the extra money spent. Good shipping time though.
4,Warning:,"The description says '3X 3"" x 21"" Grit Sanding Belt - 5 Pack'This tells me that a pack has 5 items but that for the cost there are 3 packs.. ie, 3X .. This is not correct. You only get 1 pack.Product itself is good, but misleading on the quantity."
4,Knits for Barbie Doll : 75 Fabulous Fashions for Knitting by Nicky Epstein,I have a granddaughter that loves her Barbie dolls. I love to knit. It is a good way for me to give her doll clothes without spending alot of money.
1,Fact or Fiction???,"Here we go again. Another Woodward book that makes a nice story, but is not sourced. Woodward does not note his sources and so the reader does not really know if this a work of fact, fiction or a little of both. Shall we all just believe Bob and take him at his word. Hahahhah Give me a break!!!"
4,"Engaging, Surprising, and Informative","I read this book wanting to be better informed about how The Fed and Greenspan operate, and wound up being thoroughly educated and entertained understanding how banks, the White House and Washington DC political appointments work. I never thought I would ever use the phrase ""hard-to-put-down"" in connection with an economics/banking book but this one did it. It was a real page turner and definitely one of Bob Woodward's most underrated and under-discussed books. (No caller mentioned this work during his 3-hour C-Span interview a few months back.) Get your hands on a copy of this book and prepare for an interesting and enjoyable ride. My one complaint: I wish it were longer. Although this book answered all my ""Fed"" questions, I wished its time track would continue to the present, or perhaps delve a little deeper into the past. But this complaint notwithstanding, the book was still an excellent and engaging read."
5,Amazing book about Fed's work in layman's terms,"After reading this book I realized how fascinating a book can be when it is written by a washington insider like Woodword. Amazing book describes Greenspan, Fed, Whitehouse and the economics and politics behind it in the most lucid manner possible.Very true in nature expresses very candidly Chairman Greenspan's political manuevering and how Whitehouse makes a non political instituion political.Excellent and much more interesting to read compared to Mr. Greenspans own auto biography which in itself is a very good book."
2,Typical Woodward,"I decided to pick this book up after reading ""Secrets of the Temple,"" hoping that it would serve as a sort of extended epilogue to that wonderful book by William Grieder on Paul Volker, Greenspan's predecessor at the Fed. However, I wasn't expecting much from Woodward - and unfortunately I wasn't disappointed.The book briefly chronicles Greenspan's life and offers some sharp apercus on his celebrated tenure as Federal Reserve Chairman over the past decade-and-a-half. The book provides about as much detail and insight as a well-written newspaper or journal series and can easily be read in a day or two.If you know little about the Federal Reserve and central banking in general, perhaps this book will be informative or a least serve as a primer for more serious reading. Otherwise, I don't see any reason to bother with this one..."
1,Pretty dull stuff,"I ran up on this book at ""Everything's a Dollar"" (there were SEVERAL copies of it on hand, too) and wondered why a new book by Bob Woodward about Alan Greenspan would end up there. It didn't take me long to figure it out. I have read other Woodward books (the best two being All the President's Men and The Final Days), but this one is more like The Brethren: an excruciatingly hard to read account of a subject that surely is more interesting than it comes across. I have taken so many Economics courses that I now know absoutely nothing about the subject, but if you like economics and reading about federal monetary policy you'll be able to wade through this book. Otherwise, you won't. I gave up and gave it away."
2,2 out of every 5 points he makes are right,This book makes a macroeconomic text book look exciting! It might be a fun read if you'd like to go through all his assumptions and see how many he got wrong or completely missed.
1,Bland and Blander,"Bob Woodward peaked when he was Robert Redford in ""All the President's Men"" or to be less tongue in cheek, when he wrote that book with Carl Bernstein. Since then he churns out book after book, appears on TV and is Bland. I don't get it. Why is he considered the Guru of Washington? If he is, G..d help us. Because this man is always, unswervingly unimaginative. I agree with reviewers who say he should stick to journalism and forget this book mania. He produces nothing that stimulates, nothing in ""Maestro"" that teaches us anything in depth about Alan Greenspan. And his arrogance... Don't get me started! But DO save your money and don't buy this book."
1,Fed Schmed,"Looking for a book to give you profound insight into the inner sanctum of the most powerful financial institution in the history of the world? This book isn't it. Woodward appears clueless about economics and trivializes the actions of the FOMC while attempting to raise Alan Greenspan to diety status. Ironically, the portrait of Greenspan emerges as more of a benign genius who is as in the dark as the rest of us concerning the consequences of FOMC actions. Woodwards attempts to dramatize each one-quarter of a point Fed Funds move fall flat, both in analyis and results. Its such a shame that this book will become what many readers will undoubtedly regard as a ""true"" picture of the Fed simply because it hit the NY Times bestseller list. Obviously, that was the only truth to which Woodward and his publishers aspired . . . sell a bunch of books."
1,Not big enough for a doorstop.,"...It's actually cheaper to throw this book away than to resell it. This is an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" book, where no one's pointing out the obvious nakedness of the emperor but are in fact hyping those snazzy threads."
2,Greenspan's role is overrated,"Alan Greenspan had a limited impact on the economy in the 1990's. The boom was brought about by record low oil prices in real dollars and the ""dollarization"" of the world economy. In effect,the US was able to run substantial trade deficits with minimal negative impact since foreign banks (OPEC and the Far East) held dollars as their reserve currency. The demographics of the American population also contributed to unprecedented economic growth. With a record number of baby boomers entering their prime income earning years during the mid-80's through the 1990's, the demand for housing and cars was bound to grow with a Democrat or a Republican in the White House. Don't forget that the S&L bailout in the late 1980's forced the government to compete with the private sector for capital, further stalling the economy. Clinton had the fortune of taking office at a better time than any president in American history."
2,"Good reporter, poor book writer","Woodward has never, in my opinion, written a good book. His specialty and genius is the newspaper article. As a result this book is another in a series by him that I find informative but written without verve or excitement. He makes the obvious points: that Greenspan endures political pressures, that he studies a massive amount of data, that he makes statements that are vague and leave room for face-saving exits. Other interesting tidbits include how Greenspan uses cocktail parties with the political elite to find out who is up and who is down and that Greenspan once rubbed elbows with the superficial social philosopher Ayn Rand.However, I found reading the book a chore, which is sad. I think Woodward has good stories to tell but books are not his medium."
3,"Definately runs at least 1 size large, soles wear fast","Got a pair of these for my 9yo son. They do run a full size large which I knew from other reviews so we were prepared for them to be a bit large since we were ordering a size 3 and couldn't go any smaller. My son loves them and has been wearing them nonstop since he got them a couple of weeks ago but we've already had to replace the insoles and the tread is wearing at an alarming rate. So all in all I am not sure how I feel about them, my son is satisfied but I'm afraid he'll need another pair inside of a few more months and that could get a bit pricey."
1,low quality,if you are a service member period these boots are not for you. if your some kid who plays airsoft soldier or paintball and wants too look like a soldier then its a good cheap buy. they are flimsy and dont give you support needed like an issue boot.
2,Somewhat disappointing,"A pair of boots like these were issued to me when I was in the service. After about 10 years, they are finally worn out. I tried these for a replacement. First, the sizing was way off; my boots are a size 12. I ordered these in size 12, and my feet swam in them. Second, the soles are not the same tough rubber. I don't know how long these would have lasted, but probably not as long as the old ones.I ended up with these...http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001317KQW...and they were much better, with the vulcanized rubber sole and more accurate sizing."
3,size is bigger,"this is a very good item, quality and everything's good, just the size 10 indicated arrived size bigger..."
2,Seam came apart on side of boot,"I bought these for my 17 year old son for a Christmas present. By January 18th, the seam came apart on the top side of the boot. He didn't rip them or hang them on anything. They looked like new boots with a 1 inch rip in the seam. So I'm going to take to a shoe repair place and see if they can repair them. Other than that, he said they are really comfortable."
4,it's good enough,"the boots looks good, they are light weight and the quality is medium, overall a nice pair of boots and are good according to the price. the material in wich they are built seems to be very light so i just hope they last for a while.."
3,Price great but not for the everyday.,"I would use these for paintball or airsoft but not everyday. There is no ankle support and the quality is not the best. But can you really expect a lot for $30 bucks. If you are going to use these every once it a while, great shoe because of the price. The boots do run a size big so order accordingly. Shipping was fast and have no problem with the company that sells them."
4,Good boots,"I purchased these for my 11 year old son. Try finding desert camo combat boots in a size six. Well, then have them and they are really well made boots. The speed lace is a really nice touch, especially for a kid."
2,sole of shoe,"The shoes lace up very easily and they are comfortable, but after only 1 week the soles started to come off the bottom of the shoe"
5,good item,Very well made boots. Nice and hard. Comfortable when standing most of the day. The leather is very thin and the boot feels very light.
4,GREAT BOOTS FOR ME,"I think that these are great boots and do everything that I need them to do. My question is, how do you clean them. What product do you use? There were no instructions for basic maintenance. If anyone can help please do so."
3,Good Boot/Short Life.,Active duty Army. These boots have been used hard for about 6 months and held up however the rubber sole has sine gone flat and I have lost considerable tread under the balls of my feet.
5,Great lens cap,It has a solid feel to it just like nikon cameras. It fit my slim nikon polarizer even with a good grip. Highly recommended if you think $13 is not a high price.
1,Unsatisfactory Response,I ordered a lens cap that was too big. So I returned it to the sender and requested a smaller size which I specified now that I understood the measurements. Instead of a replacement I received a refund one third the original price. I decided it wasn't worth arguing about.
3,Item is not what is shown in picture...,"It's a lens cap. It does the job. But don't be fooled by the picture in the description. This is not an official Nikon Lens Cap. I purchased this item thinking it was so, but did not receive the lens cap in the picture.What I received was a lens cap that, instead of saying Nikon in the middle like the image shows, actually says 'Designed for Nikon'.Just be warned that you are not purchasing a Nikon lens cap, but a lens cap designed FOR a Nikon lens (whatever that really means).That said, the cap fits just fine, and allows operation with a lens hood, but I can't be sure that it will always stay on securely. Time will tell."
1,China knock-off,"Not Nikon, cheap knock-off, passed off as original Nikon cap. Spend the extra three or four bucks to get factory Nikon cap with free shipping! (shipping was more expensive than this cap)"
3,Not an authentic Nikon lens cap!,"This cap was made by a third party, contrary to the description and picture of a Nikon-made item. The sign on the cap says ""Designed for (in small letters) Nikon (in large letters)"". After I complained, the seller immediately apologized and issued a refund, allowing me to keep the item.It is a fair deal, but if you are not looking for a deal, better buy an authentic Nikon lens cap at about twice the price from a specialized photo store.Update: The cap worked similarly to the aauthentic product after all, so I am giving it 3 stars instead of 2."
1,Poor fit,"Despite being advertised as a ""replacement"" cap, the cap doesn't fit very well and isn't like the original cap at all."
4,Excellent Nikon Imitation,"This excellent lens cap is not an official Nikon cap. It's a fake, but a very good one. It fits and works just like the Nikon cap, and costs much less than real Nikon caps.The caps I bought at least, are nearly indistinguishable from the real caps. The paint on the front saying ""Nikon"" is an ever-so-slightly different font. There's a tiny (<1mm) hole on the edge and an included string for tethering (I don't use it). The Nikon cap says ""LC-67"" on the back and this one doesn't.Compared to the real Nikon caps, they feel the same, fit the same over the lenses, and have the same pinch mechanism that makes Nikon caps much better than other brand's caps. I use these on my Mamiya 7 lenses because the Mamiya caps are loose and annoying in comparison.Recommended. You can get about five of these for the cost of one legit Nikon cap, and they're just as good. Shame on Nikon for charging so much for their own replacement caps."
3,Deceptive Picture,"Everything is fine about this replacement cap; it does what it's supposed to do but this is NOT an authentic Nikon product as pictured. The cap you'll receive says ""Designed for Nikon"" front and center. The price of this one varies by seller. I paid $8 a week ago and see that it's now $3. If you aren't picky about the brand name thing, this'll do. Otherwise, you can get an authentic replacement cap on the Adorama website for about $12."
5,Works Great,I had lost my original lens cap so I purchased this one - it fits perfectly. I also bought the stretchy cord that attaches to the lens cap & allows it to hang from the camera so I won't lose it next time!
5,Great 2nd time purchased this,cheap and solid. Fit my D90 camera. Would definitely recommend this if you are considering getting a replacement or having another for backup.
4,Good buy!,"This product arrived fairly quickly after purchase. The free shipping was great, and although there was a minor shipping issue, the seller rectified that right away. This cap does have trouble staying on sometimes, and I wish it had the cord to connect it to the camera, but overall I am very satisfied with both the product and the seller."
5,Trancendent Reading Experience,I've treasured this work of Mr. Wolfe's since purchasing it in the first edition in 1988. I can think of few authors who can transport their readership into relms of utter beauty and transcedence. Experiencing them is a gift to behold.A MUST start for those who have not read anything by Wolfe.A treasure for all times.
5,Doesn't taste sugar free :D,"I never liked sugar free drinks or drink mixes because I couldn't stand the aftertaste. But this drink mix doesn't have the nasty aftertaste. It is soooooo good! Buy them at the Dollar tree, they only cost a dollar ( as it should since it's a dollar store)"
4,"The home guide to cartidge conversions, by George C. Nonte","Probebly the best guide to converting cartriges there is, however it is somewhat dated being last printed in 1967... Still an exelent book on the subject."
4,love it,"Love it, it looks great as my bedside lamp, Only prob is top screw is kinda hard to get tight"
5,IT'S THE BEST IN THE WORLD :),The Book is really Awesome anyone who likes the Spice Girls should really get this Book because it's the BEST!!!!! END
1,PATHETIC!,"The Spice Girls are just lucky. They miraculously passed an audition and were chosen to be the next manufactured group. This ersatz group cannot act, play an instrument, sing or deliver lines convincingly. They are laughable and embarrassing.As much as I detest the Spice Girls, the only value they have is that they have somehow helped many girls feel better about themselves.Forget the Spice Girls. Nasty Spice, Rancid, Rotten, Stinky and Stupid belong down the drain which is the place for old spices. Listen to women who are REALLY talented like Buffy St. Marie, Mariah Carey, Madonna, Joni Mitchell, Alanis Morrisette, Ann Osborne and Melissa Etheridge. They are the REAL talents!"
5,"Jimmy Walker, un virtuoso de la flauta","Este cd es una producción muy interesante en cuanto es una propuesta más por unir el jazz con la música académica, quizá como lo hicieran en su momento Claude Bolling o Jacques Loussier.Jimmy Walker (Primera flauta solista de la Filarmónica de Los Angeles por varios años) junto a su grupo Freeflight nos ofrece arreglos de jazz de temas emblemáticos del repertorio flautístico como obras de Bach, Debussy, además de una intensa interpretación de la Sonatine de Henri Dutilleux, tocados magistralmente por este virtuoso flautista, dueño de una técnica arrolladora y de gran sonido.Excelente y original propuesta."
2,Hmm.. produced by stanley clarke,i have a jim walker's private flight. it a used CD... But sound is good.. this album's producer is famous bassist stanley clarke. but not good....
3,Average,"It gives me no pleasure to criticize an album. Especially Jazz albums that get far too little attention as it is.However, this one leaves me cold. It opens strongly with three good (great even) tracks, and then takes a bad dive.By the time it reaches ""Summertime"" a Gershwin number, he's literally murdering it.I would also have to say that, to my ear, the quality of this recording is poorer than I'm used to.These young guys deserve all the praise and plaudits they get, they're working hard to further Jazz. But on this recording Harris is far too middle-of-the-road for me, too lightweight. Daryll Hall is on bass here, and I could barely make out what he playing. There's a lightness, a slightness to the proceedings. Which is a pity, because the opening track is terrific. Even the Sting tune is surprisingly good.This is a 3 star effort. Apologies for being the only naysayer! In my defense, I have four other recordings by the guy. ;-)"
1,"Great Idea, too bad it doesn't work",I have one of these for my Nomad Jukebox. It kind of works. There is a great deal of static/interference no matter what frequency I use. This makes the product pretty much unusable.
3,sweet little romance for summer reading,"Barbara Taylor Bradford's ""Love in Another Town"" is a lightweight little book to read on a breezy summer afternoon, lying in the hammock. Her story unfolds smoothly, effortlessly, with apt descriptions of people and places; she has a sure touch with realistic dialogue, and a sure knowledge into her characters' hearts.She swings into the supernatural with the account of a life-changing near-death experience of one of the women. All endswell as people grow through misfortune, make their choices, findauthentic love and happiness.Recommended for a couple of carefree summer hours under a big shade tree---lemonade would be good too!"
2,Yuck,"I like a good easy read, but I would still like to read something I can enjoy, and get something from.....other than a stomach ache.Bradford's story reeks with cliche's, predicatability, and obvious dilema's. Not the worst book of this genre I've ever read...but quickly spun, and too easy."
1,Makes Danielle Steele look like Shakespeare,"This book was really lame. It is riddled with cliches and it is shorter then a young adult novel. Total waste of time. The Lifetime movie was much better, so you know how bad this really was."
3,Makes you think...,I am a BTB fan but I feel this book was rather basic for her. I liked the story and there were many points that really made me thing and gave me hope for the future. I was disappointed in the length though and wished the story had continued. Overall a good read.
2,Dissapointing,"Being a fan of Barbara's I was truly dissapointed in this tale of love. As I turned the pages, I was more and more dissapointed, especially by the love scene, which for me, lacked style. I have read ""trashy novels"" (Mills & Boon) which have more style than this book! After having read ""A secret affair"", which I loved, I was hoping that ""Love in another town"" would be as good or better! I will be reading ""Angel"" next and will be expecting Barbara's usual style!"
2,"A disappointment, to say the least.","As someone who has always looked forward to reading Barbara Taylor Bradford's novels, I was truly disappointed in Love in Another Town. Gone was the wonderful character development, riveting character interactions and vivid description I've always admired in Ms. Bradford's writing. I don't know whether she just finished this one too quickly, or if she is in a slump. I'm hoping that her next one will be up to her usual high caliber."
4,Bring On Some More,"I have never had a problem downloading or playing any of these episodes from Unbox. They've always downloaded fairly quickly and they've never locked up my computer once. My only complaint is they need to add seasons seven and eight! This is a great service and since Anchor Bay is not releasing seasons six through eight on DVD, Amazon is the only place we can get them. Come on Amazon, GIVE US MORE SILK!!"
1,Hated it!,I couldn't get beyond chapter 3. I'm so tired of so-called regency novelists writing in modern language and including sexual innuendo or activities that no decent regency heroine would think or do. Do you really think that people in the 1810s said 'Absolutely!'? I think not; they might have well said 'what's happening baby!'.
2,boring,"After forcing myself to read about a quarter of this book I have put it aside. I read anything - labels - signposts - etc. Maybe if I have nothing and I mean nothing ,I will go back and finish. Really awful"
1,Boring! Boring! Boring!,"This book is sooo boring! If I wasn't reading it on my kindle I would have thrown it across the room by now; and I'm only a quarter of the way through! The main character is completely self absorbed and incredibly stupid! It amazes me how stupid she is! If you like books where finding a husband is a life or death situation and the characters pretty much gossip throughout the whole damn thing than this is the book for you. I, personally, need a book with more substance and characters I can admire."
2,"Sad, strange, and ridiculous",Save your money -- the characters are not interesting or believable enough even for escapist fare on a lazy Saturday afternoon!
2,Longwinded,"As I seem to begin most of my reviews these days, all the ingredients were there in this book. A spinster, opinionated beautiful heroine and a rakish hero. The first part of the book dragged interminably. There was a meeting between the H and h and then she went to tea and OMG I thought I was in another book! The author waffled on about her best friend and her romance and highwaymen and secret assignments.. I got a bit lost. Then finally the hero returned and there were some interesting bits. There was one love scene and it was written well. I think the author has potential and if she could tell the main story without all the meanderings off, it would have been a better book."
2,Unhitch the plow....,"I have all the respect in the world for someone who can write a story, it takes so much work and effort. But the pacing in this book was just sooooo sloooooow. When I sit down to read for a half an hour I want the story to go places. I am a fast reader and in half an hour I think the heroine moved from one room to another (slight exaggeration) I couldn't finish this book although I tried a few times. Maybe if I had actually liked the characters I might have but it was grueling. The oh so beautiful heroine who was as dumb as a brick. Sorry, but the whole idea of confronting the highwayman by herself at night??? Yeah right. I can handle breathtaking beauty when there are some brains along with it. Maybe I missed the point, but this one did not do it for me."
2,I don't understand the 5-star ratings,"The story begins with the heroine being insensitive, selfish, inconsiderate. I don't know why her best friend stays friends with her. Early in the story the heroine meets the man who will be her husband. But then we don't see him again for more than 1/3 of the book. I just couldn't stand the heroine's personality long enough to see (1) the hero come back to the story, or (2) the heroine improve enough to be likable. I made several attempts to read this story, but finally gave up about 1/3 the way through."
4,Book purchase,I have not read the book yet but the ease of purchasing books online if great and the prices are very good too.
3,funny,"Funny in some parts and slow in others... a nice, light,and enjoyable read, but it was predictable, not that memorable. I had to go back and review the book to write this opinion. I am glad I bought it."
4,Unladylike Pursuits,"Emily Sinclair at 25 years old feels she is a spinster. Free to run her own life, pursue her own dreams. But her father and somewhat crazy stepmother have other plans, they feel she should be married, and have decided who would make her happy, her stepmother's nephew! The stepmother's nephew happens to be someone she totally does not like. They give her one month, if she can find someone else that will marry her; she does not have to marry the nephew. This leads to a very entertaining read.Even from a man's perspective."
5,"entertaining, fun read",I love to read historical fiction. And I found myself chuckling a few times with this one. What a fun read!
4,Enjoyed,There were some slow parts. Other than that I enjoyed reading it. The overall story is very good. I liked how the author would insert some things about Sophie so we know how here love life is doing. I do kind of wish that there was more to it and also that it didn't end. I do suggest reading it! I know that I definitely will read it again soon if not later! (^_^)
4,Great for the purpose,"Nice quality, fits perfectly in stacking letter-size trays, works well, has a small hole in each divider for a quick check of which slots have work filed and whether yesterday's file was emptied. Great tool for matching paperwork with deadlines."
4,Strikingly different,The majority of this album is brilliant i especially like border which manages to stay chilled out despite it's kicking backbeat the dj lord fader mix of more beats and pieces is also a favourite but the thing that really struck me about this album was the second cd containing vjamm this program is a work of genius a superb concept brilliantly done if you've never seen or used it i strongly reccomend you visit the ninja tunes site and download it this is the most interesting computer freebie i have ever recieved with an album
4,Good stuff,"Not exactly ambient or dance-along kind of music. It was hard-to-get-into at first as well. Gets better with next listenings, much better. My personal favorites are Border, The Tale of Virginia Epitome and More Beats&Pieces."
4,It is simply good,"I like to work on my computer with this CD in my sterios, played LOUD especially Atomic 2000 live in Tokio. I recoment this CD"
4,"Everything you wanted to know about flying, but ....","Singer is extremely witty and enthusiastic about her topic, and demystifies the human passion for flying, from the wacky to the rational. This is not a technical study, rather a good story, with fun illustrations. Leave that book on your coffee table: with a title like that, you know people will want to find out more..."
3,"Thorough, useful","Very detailed information about a remote part of the planet. Good pictures, but very small in the book. Day-by-day diary information for a trip on the Karakoram highway by bicycle, too. It appears the reviewers last visited in 2003 or 2004. The current (2007) security situation near the Northwest Frontier provinces (where Osama is allegedly hiding) is an important concern in deciding to make the trip. It would be helpful to list a URL in the book for up-to-date security information, on a Lonely Planet web site."
2,Errors create doubt,"I used this guide in 1988. Loney Planet has had time to correct errors. Let us hope they have.Example: Lonely Planet said catch a bus in Peshawar for Darra at the bus station in Grand Trunk Road. No one in Peshawar had a clue what Grand Trunk Road might mean. In Peshawar, Grand Trunk Road is known as GT Road.After much difficulty getting this sorted out, the traveler learns that buses for Darra do not leave from this station. Buses for both Darra and Chitral leave from an open field called something like Nee Ooo Wah Dah.These errors create doubt about the reliability of the rest of the guide.One expects better from Lonely Planet."
2,"Some Good Laughs, but very over-praised","It's fun to hear the Spinal Tap moments where he baits the crowd (once), but this was a so-so night for Iggy and Co. After slogging through a half a dozen similar CD's, it's clear that these guys got a lot of help in the studio.People who like the legendary rep of this disc would do better to just buy the tee shirt."
2,NOT THE BEST,"What can I say, it's Iggy & The Stooges LIVE in Detroit, but it sounds like crap! I had a copy of this same show on record (remember records?) that sounded twice as good as this does. I bought this for a couple of songs (Rich B*tch, etc) but if you can find the orignal blue cover LP on vinyl, pick that up and leave this badly dubbed CD alone. I am getting sick and tired (pun intended) of all the die hard Iggy fans giving four and five stars to CD's that sound like sh*t. Buy the remasted CD's of The Stooges and Funhouse, search out the original CD of Raw Power (Iggy's new re-mix is digital distorted), and you should have all the Stooges you need."
4,Carl Sagan died for your sins,"Sure, the fidelity is poor throughout, however, not bad enough to make it unlistenable. The band blasts through the songs with ferocity, if not subtlety. Don't buy this unless you've got all three Stooges studio albums, but this is a good addition to that set, and a historically important recording as well. As someone reviewing this earlier noted, the audience in the second cd is, if not overwhelmingly positive, at least they don't seem to be as violently opposed to Iggy and Co as their counterparts on the first disc."
3,not bad,"I was looking for a simple in dash stereo/video set. This product did convince me, however the clock settings work when it feels like and the angle button don't work (invalid key).Over all the set is good great power, excellent audio, good video."
5,Wonderful book,True story of a Native American woman who overcame odds and became a doctor. Very inspiring and a good glimpse into Native American culture and its connection to the modern world.
5,The scalpel and the silver bear,"The test of a good book lies in its readability, more so in the case of a non fiction.The author's narrative style is simple and interesting and hence very readable. As I read through the book I felt as if I was travelling with the author through this life journey of hers. What makes the book acceptable is the fact that the author does not make any judgement about the cultures that she has to be in. Her attempt to combine the best of both the worlds is the main attraction in the book. I agree with her totally that the need of the hour is holistic approach to any medical intervention. Coming from India I do understand the gap in the modern approach to 'cure', namely the 'healing'. I wish many non native Indians would read this book and benefit from its facts.I wish the doctor all the very best in her present endevour of popularising the holistic approach among the modern medical world."
4,The Scalpel and the Silver Bear,This book explores the remarkable journey of a Navajo women who leaves the reservation to train as a surgeon. It contrasts traditional Navajo practices with those of western medicine and illustrates how one women was able negotiate two worlds at odds with one another. The book provoked me to re-evaluate some of my assumptions of western medicine and heightened my awareness of cultural differences in philosophy of medical care. The book is thought-provoking and inspirational. A quick and easy read.
1,"Great looking, but fell apart in less than a month","I'm so disappointed with this watch. I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband. I love the way it looks and it has a nice weight and feel to it as well.A week ago, the second week in January, the pin holding the band to the watch face started coming out, and he keeps pushing it back in but it keeps falling out. My husband just has a desk job where he is dressed in suit and tie every day, so it's not like the watch has received abuse. The last watch I purchased for him was in 1997 and held up this long.I am going to unfortunately return this item now, as we are still within the return timeframe. I really loved this watch, and it stinks when a gift you buy someone falls apart on them."
4,Bought this as a gift,"I bought this watch as a gift for my boyfriend. He doesn't wear watches ever but needed one for work. He wears it everyday even when he isn't at work so that must mean he likes the style. It keeps time well, however, there is no dials to change the three little dials like the date and such, you have to spin the clock adjustment around and around and around to set the date, this is slightly inconvenient. i wear a higher quality watch (Michael Kors) as my daily watch so im used to the easy adjustments, however, for the price of this watch it is and excellent choice. My boyfriend seems very happy with it."
4,An Attractive Watch,"Relic watches are made by Fossil, a company that already has earned a good reputation by me because I owned one of their watches before purchaseing the Relic. This watch has an attractive bezel, band, and face with three dials for day of the week, date, and 24 hour functions. Also, the watch has kept accurate time so far.I didn't rate this five stars, because the day of the week cannot be set separately and must be turned in 24 hour cycles to get the correct day."
3,the pictures are nice.,"This rare and expensive little book is very hard to find. So little(really) is written about the fabulous F.W.Murnau, who left this world so young. Thanks to Amazon, I ordered an old copy from a book store in Toronto. It finally arrived. The black-and-white pictures are fabulous! I couldn't wait to read it. Sadly, my ability to read French is sorely lacking..."
4,Quick Acting - Great product!,I must say I had my doubts when I initially bought this product.. But after having used it I am convinced that it is value for money. It is quite quick to get absorbed into the soil and shows results within a few days! The only drawback is its effects wear off quite quickly and hence I am running through the pack quite quickly! It would also have been great if the pack came with a handy measuring cup that most other suppliers include...
4,My Soapbox review....,"This book , in my own opinion was quite good. It does what most reference books don't.....show the uniforms(or items of interest) in perfect light and studio conditions. Don't get me wrong,I know it is good to see true-to-life photos, but they usually don't give you an idea, or visual picture like this book. The only bad part of this book is that it shows too few examples of variants during this conflict. The thing that make up for it is the price of the book....it was $24.95 originally. IMHO this book is worth $40-50 max in new condition."
1,This was the worst buy I have ever made,"ok, i wrote a review about this product a while back on this same page saying how good it was. I take EVERYTHING i said back. This is bound to be the worst buy I have ever made. I have had this product only 4 months, and three of the pads are broken. 2 will only make a very slight noise when you beat at it as hard as you can, and the other one is completely dead, and i do not believe i hit this drum set any more than anyone else. This machine has great sounds, but it has the worst durability ever. Do not buy this machine, I swear you will regret it, it may be good for little kids wanting to learn to play the drums but for any other use besides that, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT"
4,"Funky, Funky Drummer","Harvey Mason is enjoying a little re-issue karma these days. Unfortunately most of the pressings are coming from Japan, but at least they're available. Mason has played on literally hundreds, possibly thousands of records, from the 60's to the present. Everything from solo efforts like this one to Whitney Houston records in the 80's.Jazz-funk chops are way out front on this outing and it holds shelf space nicely with the like of the Headhunters, Donald Byrd or Miles Davis fusion. Not surprisingly, Mason played with at least 2 of the aforementioned three. Plus, the accompaniment on this record reads like a who's who of jazz-funk luminaries from the 70's.By far Harvey's best performance I've heard on a record is on ""Love's So Far Away,"" from Donald Byrd's ""Blackbyrd"" album. The beat the man keeps up for this tune is some intricate kit work you're not likely to hear anywhere west of Bernard Purdie. Highly recommended."
4,It's Alright,"Bought it to be a center piece on the dinning room table, and it is actually quite a large holder. Otherwise, it's fine. I added some decorative garland too, to jazz it up a bit. But it was a lot larger than I expected. Looks good overall."
5,Yep,I love the unusual design of this item. It works great and has generated lots of compliments in my new kitchen.
5,beautiful and functional,this wine rack is beautiful and functional without taking up a lot of space. Looks great on my kitchen island.
2,Over priced,"For what it is this book is over priced. I didn't find the patterns that unusual, or the garments interesting. Using the patterns is restricted."
3,1930s disappointment,"I admit I am impressed by the number of patterns - but the design quality of the patterns are not all that. The 1930s brings to mind amazing bias cuts, daring art deco geometry, asymmetrical lines, lavish lines - NONE of which are present in this volume. The patterns are not for beginners, though the simplistic lines - I could of guessed and done without it because I drape. The three stars are for those uninitiated and unacquainted with vintage fashions - for whom may need this tome. My advice, buy vintage fashions and deduce it from there - or better yet, and this is what I really recommend - buy Betty Kirke's classic tome on Vionnet. That classic timeless and best book ever on Vionnet gives one more patterns and way better designs for about roughly the same price!"
1,For Completists Only.,"Delbert remains the Keeper of the Flame, the best roadhouse rocker in the biz, but this is a very disappointing release. Everybody who worked in Texas fell into the hands of the infamous Huey Meaux at one time or another, and Delbert was no exception. These cuts were made in the 60s when he was yet to form his own personal fusion of country and R & B, and suffer, like his first efforts for Major Bill Smith, from a lack of direction - and a typically mean spirited set of production values from Meaux. A mixture of garage rock and Beatles-influenced rock 'n' roll - but none of the fire of the later Delbert. One to miss."

4,Romantic reverie,"Even though this album is a little sad, it's great to hear a mature Francoise Hardy in duet with old friends. Some of the songs are just beautiful, while some are very sad and perhaps thought provoking. As a fan of Francoise Hardy in her youth, I am thrilled to have this CD. AND it gives me a reason to brush up on some of my French vocabulary!"
4,coffee in a fun cup,"What people don't think about is how hot chocolate works just as well as coffee in a coffee mug. I'm not a coffee drinker but if this mug brings you great coffee joy you should also pour hot chocolate in it. I have to take a point off because after you pour coffee in this mug enough times a permanent smell is left there, which means using this cup for anything other than coffee or hot chocolate is gross. Especially water. Who wants to take a sip of water only to smell coffee every time you put the mug to your face? Not me. Not that the smell of coffee is horrible or anything. It smells good and I can't imagine not smelling it every morning when other people in my home are making some.A great mug you should buy."
2,Review,"Poor mastering, mixing & packaging from a company that clearly does not respect it's artists or the public. Only bought as I am a completist."
4,"OK, Not his best","This book was previously published under the title, ""A Bullet for Cinderella"". There is an interesting biography of Macdonald included."
4,Same as Bullet for Cinderella,"This one has a nice biographic intro, for about the same price at the time I write this. The intro calls Keynes ""discredited,"" though - JDM is spinning....!"
3,Don't buy this unless you are a kid.,"This game is for kids only. It will be even worse if you own a PS3. I bought this game because I wanted to try to go back to the old gays and play the good originals, but this is an original for kids."
5,Digimon 4 Game Rating,"Purchased this game for my 8 and 12-year old nephews - They enjoy it and spend a lot of time playing it. Good game...quick shipping - Overall, a good purchase choice."
1,Redundant,"Hoppy shoots the bad guys, then banters with his buddies, then shoots more bad guys, then does more bantering, then ..."
5,My classroom loves this Siing me a story CD,I saw Bob McGrath at a conferencee in CA in November and he sang songs from this CD. I loved him and the cd too. I found it on Amazon and it was cheaper than any where else and I got it in 2 days. Bravo Amazon
4,Iowa cookbook review,"Iowa cooks are some of the best in the country and this collection of their favorite recipes doesn't disappoint.I gave it as a gift and the recipient loved it. Although she is very busy, within a couple of days, she was at my door with a wonderful cake baked by following one of the recipes in this book."
1,Best of Iowa Cookbook,"I was very disappointed in this book as I purchased it for a friend that was raised in Iowa and already had a lot of great recipes from her childhood. There were not many recipes, most were not something that Iowan's eat constantly like my friend had talked about. I have seen some of her recipe books and feel this does not do justice to Iowa....."
5,Iowa's Favorite Cookbooks,I enjoy all the receipes in this book. It brought back a lot of childhood memories.
4,Jinx High Good book for college students,"This is a good book it has lots of charictor and style. It does get a little slow in places, but it picks up speed fast. So you wont want to put it down. All in all I think this book is great for college students, but not highschool kids. To much adult grammer."
2,Miso,"I absolutely love the great majority of the rest of what Ms. Lackey has written, but I couldn't even finish this book after getting half way through. This is the most Miso-MAN-istic... STUFF! I have ever read. From what I read this is the most anti-man fiction I have ever read.and I LIKE women protagonists :.("
2,Weakest tale of the series,"I loved ""Burning Water"" and ""Children of the Night"". However, I had to struggle through this book, and it felt like it was targeted to a younger audience. It reminded me of the movie ""The Craft"" which was better IMHO."
2,Second keyboard so far which has keys fall off.,"This is ridiculous! With the first keyboard, I just thought it was one of those things. I limped along with it, taped the ""b"" key to the board and made do with a key that was coming loose and flopping around. Then I spilled water on that keyboard and that was it.I liked the Adesso keyboard otherwise (liked that it was for Macs) and so I got another one. I have been only using it for a few months, and the same thing! Now it's the Return key and the 9 key that are falling off. I'll try to make do for a while, but that's it. Never again. No more Adesso keyboards for me."
2,Great if you only need a keyboard for 2 months,Adesso's keyboards are great for the 2 months or so that they work. I kept wanting to think that I got a bad one but I made the mistake of getting another one somewhere along the way and it did the exact same thing. It's worth spending a bit more and getting something sturdier.
5,Nielsen is simply amazing,"Nielsen has written a virtually self-contained treatise on the subject. Reading this book was a beautiful learning experience: The author's clarity of thought was striking; the examples made particular points transparent; and the exercises made invaluable contributions to understanding.The three appendices (on measure and probability, the Lebesque integral, and the heat equation), and the first three chapters make the book as self-contained as is possible.Synopsis: I do not know of a better book on this subject."
5,Great book,I have always been fascinated with those who climb Mt. Everest. This is such a great down to earth book. You feel as though you are along for the climb and how very difficult it is. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
5,A Great and Thorough Overview of Marketing Management,I have known Professor Kotler for a long time and I have admired his work in marketing. It is a subject that has been downplayed by a lot of top business schools in this country.This particular Kotler book was brought to my attention by a friend of mine who is a top marketing strategist on Madison Avenue. He heard that I was interested in reading something about marketing management so he gave the book to me as a gift.It is amazing how practical and clear the book is. It gives a vivid picture of marketing in a corporation and insights about how to improve one's marketing department. It is also a great book for beginners in marketing for it offers thorough overview of marketing management(something that can be applied to life and business).
4,Strong general overview!,"This book offers an overview of modern marketing principles. It is strongest for its clear conveyance of general concepts but may leave those hungering for detail unfulfilled.Those interested (as I am) in customer relationship strategy will find the following chapters most relevant. Chapter 2 describes functional responsibilities in a customer-centric organization. Chapters 3 and 8 provide strategies for delivering additional value to customers. Chapter 7 discusses the acquisition, retention and growth of customers, with a proper emphasis on retention and growth.Kotler provides many illustrative examples within his text. Isolated case studies are not used."
3,Nothing new,Repackaged and slightly updated standard Kotler fare. If you have very little idea about marketing you will find the book interesting but not very practical (how could it be practical given the breadth of scope and limited number of pages). For anyone even remotely familiar with marketing best practices the book will bring nothing new.
4,Breadth mroe than depth,"Kotler's book is great for the non-marketing person. He very well presents the current thinking on marketing topics. Read the book and you can use all the buzzwords correctly with your marketing friends if you're not a marketer. But if you're in the marketing field in any way and don't already know most of the stuff in this book, you're in trouble. You've got some serious catching up to do. Consider Kotler's book as marketing's current aerial tour, but then go buy the books referenced and really learn what you need to know."
2,"At 50,000 Feet Its Tough to Keep Your Feet On the Ground","Kotler has the reputation as the marketing king - but I dont see it. This book was full of high level garbage and lacked any actionable insight. If you're like me you are in the real world trying to take product to market, figure out how to position (or deposition the competition), how to price effectively, etc. This book does not help with reality. If you want catchy terms and 4 bullet points to impress your friends in meetings, then this is the book for you.For practical advise, seek another."
2,A bore and poorly written,"Do not buy this book. When I bought this book, I had just finished The Ten Day MBA and was eager to build upon my marketing knowledge. After 100 pages, I am totally bored by the lack of insightful points and the mediocre writing. I may not even read further because I am sure there are better marketing books for sale. The book seems almost ""pasted"" together with excerpts from other books."
3,Pop up Greeting Cards,"This was a rather more difficult book than the others by Chatani and by Chatani and Nakazawa, but the designs are exceptionally lovely even to see. I'd recommend the other volumes to start: Pop-up Cards, Paradise of Origamic Architecture, Paper Magic, and White Christmas."
4,Desgins are awesome,"This book is rather hard to read due to the lack of contrasting colors, even though I rated it 4-star. Other than that, it has fabulous designs. Even beginners would find the book satisfying and gratifying."
4,simple plot with lots of action,"Tiger is a great book for young readers who want a simple plot with lots of action. The character is a kung fu trained monk with the spirit and fighting style of a tiger. The plot if full of martial arts, plans for revenge and the typical lessons one would expect in a story from China set in the 1600's. This was a very difficult book to put down, and thanks to the easy writing style it was a very satisfying experience that fit into one sitting. A must-read for young fans of martial arts."
5,Review by my son Morgann- 8 yrs old,"I would recommend this book especially for boys 8 years and older. I enjoyed the book because it has different types of Kung Fu martial arts and lots of action. The plot has good versus the evil empire trying to acquire the Dragon Scrolls from Cangzhen Temple. The 5 brother characters are based on fierce animal types of Kung Fu techniques. One brother called Ying turned evil and stole the scrolls and was leading the Emperor's army. The other brothers are trying to get the scrolls back and make Ying good again.I enjoyed this book even though it was a bit long with 196 pages. If you like history, action and evil plots then I think you will like this book."
4,Read by a Tiger,"I was first attracted to this book because according to Chinese astology, Like Fu, I am a tiger. I also love tigers and all things about them. I was very pleased with the way Jeff Stone captured the animal personas in each of the five brothers. The Kung-fu movements described in the book were very vivid and detailed. It was a very entertaining read, and I look foward to the next one."
4,"If You Like Kung Fu and Humor, Read This Book","This is the first book of the series ""The Five Ancestors.""The book is about five orphan boys who live in the secret Cangzahen temple that teaches monks the martial arts of their animal style (like hawk or dear). Those boys are the youngest masters of their animal style. Those are: Tiger, Monkey, Snake, Crane and Dragon. Their names are: Fu, Malao, Seh, Hok and Long. When ex-monk Ying destroys the temple, the grandmaster tells the boys to retreat and find out about their life, right before he and all the other monks die.This book is good for people who like Kung-fu action and humor. I recommend it for kids 10 and older.Tommy"
5,I loved the book Tiger by:Jacson moody,"I knew this book was cool,but wow.fu is the main character. in the begning fu and his borthers were cramed into a terra-cotta barrel.Outside ying and his solders attack evently ying fids the monks and eveything gose haywire. want more read the book.I geve it a 5 out of 5."
2,Choose another bowling set,"The set is VERY small and the pins are so small that they will not even stand up on their own. It is cheaply made, choose another bowling set."
4,A Great Book,"The book 'Life Lesson' which were written by Ross and David is one of my favorite books. It teaches us about the mysteries of life and living, thus it is a very valuable book. The content of this book is very broad, it includes fourteen life lessons such as the lesson of love, the lesson of anger, the lesson of forgive and so on. Because the author describes each lesson with vivid example and clear language, this book is easy to read and understand. I already read this book twice, but I still want to read it again in order to understand each life lesson that is important to me. I think this book is worth everybody to read. I recommend it to other people for three reasons: the events in the book are interesting and realistic, the author's point of view is brief and easy to understand, and the lessons in the book can instruct us how to handle the issues that we are experiencing in life."
5,A Profound Wake up Call for the Living,"Life Lessons is one of those books that EVERYONE should read. It is a call to all of us to live deeper richer lives. Because so many of the thoughts and lessons are taken from individuals who are near death, including author, Elizabeth Kubler Ross, each lesson is deeply inspiring and profound. I work as a hospital chaplain and have read many books on death and dying, but none has captured the wisdom and spirit that those near death offer us in the same way that Life Lessons does."
4,A good read for now and again to remind one what's important in life,"This book has a lot of good advice and insight in it. Yes, there are references here and there to god and whatnot. I'm not a religious person at all, but this book is not what some people may think because the ideas still apply to life regardless of your POV on spirituality; it's about lessons in life and it isn't telling people to follow certain morals of any certain religion (the authors don't try to press that onto the reader). So, if you are anti-religious and someone who's turned off by those kinds of things, start reading and begin to notice such mentionings, I advise you still don't pass over this book (it's not as if every-other word is ""god"" or something like that anyway). I would recommend this read to anyone. I really enjoyed it and it helped to remind me what in life is trivial compared to what's really important."
5,One of my favorite books!,Love this book - something I will keep on my shelf and refer to many more times throughout my lifetime - highly recommended!
3,Peace doesn't come easy,"We have had a number of family and friends passing away lately and I was looking for some philosophical book on the meaning of life and death. We are not religious so didn't want the god line since it doesn't apply. This has too much of god in it and I come away understanding that only when you are terminally ill do you ""get"" it. So not what I was looking for but lots of interesting anecdotes and if you are a believer might be a good book for you. I did pick up a Buddist book on life and death so that may have more in it for me. Will review that one too."
5,Boy Sets Fire scores again,"This is another incredible work by BSF. I first purchased ""After the Eulogy"" and was so impressed I had to go out and get more. This EP starts it off with 2 fast-paced, heavy, hardcore songs; then it goes it the lighter, more emo ""Loser of the Year Award"" and it ends with the epic ""Cavity."" The only pitfall is the mediocre cover of ""Holiday in Cambodia"" tied onto the end - no one can sing like Jello can and it ruins the perfect balance the first 4 tracks of the EP have. Get it anyway, but don't play Track 5."
5,Awesome CD,Although the CD only has 5 songs it is still awesome. Boy Sets Fire is one of the greatest hardcore bands I have ever heard. Just put it in and hit repeat. Buy it today!
1,This is a bunch of tree-hugging communist coward junk,I feel sick when I listen to this band. If they would just stop living so scared and go out and enjoy themselves they might find the world bareable (but they wouldn't have a band then would they?). These pansies don't even want people to dance at their shows. I hope these guys set fire to themselves.
3,just okay -- chain looks dirty,"I got what I paid for with this necklace, which I bought to go with the lovely matched antique garnet earrings. The earrings are great, but the necklace is quite plain and the chain looks dirty. It's not worth the cost of shipping to return it; and it's fine for very casual wear."
2,Junk,The title should sum it up. I could of bought my child a pair of non-prescription glasses and got the same result I've gotten from making this wasteful purchase. I dont recommend this for a child of any age. It just didnt work!
4,"Amazing Video Collection: Life Against Death, Description","Impressive action scenes and actual footage of drastic life-and-death situations are featured in this high-powered presentation from the creators of the television series Cops. Real-life rescues, accidents, and shoot-outs are included, with depictions of heroic acts and split-second decisions made by police and rescue personnel."
2,Not all features enabled at this time!,"This product is very economical when purchased with a rebate, yet, the WDS function only works with WEP or (worse yet) no encryption! The device does not work with WDS and WPA enabled at the same time. SMC advised that it ""MIGHT"" be fixed in a future firmware update. I've been waiting 5 months for a firmware update, to no avail. Be sure to verify the functionality that you need for your net is actually operating on this device."
4,reliable wireless router,"Never used SMC products before, but this is impressive. Easy setup, operating flawlessly for 2 months now. Strong wireless signal, good configuration layout, and dynamic DNS updating that works (as opposed to my previous DLink router). Includes true firewall features, including SPF. Does not offer WPA2, only WPA. Very little activity at SMC support site, no firmware upgrades at all. But I guess if it works this well, who needs support?"
2,"Chipmunks' ""Low Places"" a lowlight","In a career otherwise noted for groundbreaking entertainment and stunning successes, the Chipmunks' ""Low Places"" falls remarkably short of the power and feeling we have all come to expect from Alvin, Simon, and Theodore. The humble beginnings that brought them together for early albums like ""Chipmunk in MoTown"" and other widely considered classics are utterly absent from this slapshod effort, an obvious attempt to ""cash in"" on the country craze. The lack of ambition leaves most of these tracks sounding drearily pieced together, and the rumors of in-fighting between the band are appearent, especially in the last four tracks, on which all of the instruments and vocals Simon reportedly did by himself."
3,"The Chipmunks are the best, chatter is there game!","I'm not that much of a country fan, but I love the Chipmunks, they are just so darn hillarious!!- Stef with a F"
3,nice but small,"This is a really pretty barette, but it is much smaller than I had expected. It is great if you like small dainty items."
5,Koestenbaum is the daddy of the mac daddies,"Ok, here ya go. I didnt really even read the book.I've been trying to track down my old buddy Rob Helsabeck.I did a google search for his name and I saw that he reviewed this book. Rob if you're out there email me, I havent been able to contact you for the past few years man! Call my brother Bob (he lives in Abscn)...he'll give you my email address. Hope to hear from you."
1,Unsatisfying as a flat Domino's Pizza,"I concur with the earlier unsatisfactory reviews. I admit I didn't read the earlier books, but each part of a series should be able to stand alone. It was frankly unbelieveable. Lots of stupid aliens being shot up as cannon fodder for brave earthlings facing impossible odds. There should have been more story about the Posleen's and their origins and drives. There should have been more about the aliens (the Darhel or whatever) and their mechanations. Also frankly, any species with FTL capability and science is pretty much going to kick our [rears]. Their materials science alone would provide defense against our hand weapons and artillery.Alan Dean Foster did a better and more readable job in his stories about the Weave and the Amplitur.Boring!!!!"
5,Ringo shows he can actualy write on occasion,"I've been pretty scathing about some of John Ringo's work; more complimentary about other examples. This is, I think, the best: one of the very few occasions when Ringo slows down and takes enough care to get the human moments, and superb cameos, well-crafted in the midst of the ammunition and death. Recommended."
5,A Sure Fire Hit,If you have ever served in the armed services you will find a person in this book or in A Hymm before Battle that you know or think you know. This guy can write! GET IT YOU WON'T BE SORRY!
2,One - dimensional drivel,"Finishing this book was a chore. The author indulges in that worst of author's sins - worshipping his own characters. Consequently the characters are bland and one-dimensional, almost reminiscent of an L. Ron Hubbard novel.Which is about where the action and plot stands. One *tries* to get past the absolutely implausable plot and comically inept enemies - hoping that at least some slam-bang action will redeem it and make for an entertaining diversion. Alas, no.Science fiction doesn't have to be this cheesy. There's plenty of great military SF around..."
4,"Heir to David Drake, Not that he needs one",I am very impressed with Mr. Ringo's work. As I continue to read both series my only regret is that I can't make him write any faster. He is becoming a must read for Military SF readers.
4,Worth the time,"The author of this book has a good understanding of tactics, command strcutures etc. and tells a good and pretty believable story, If you like detailed Military SciFi a very good read.2 issues:Details, which at times become overwhelming, others might appreciate this more though so it's more a sense of style. If I could change one thing it would be to tone down this area maybe by 30% or so.The other issue is a bit more serious. The super patroit mentality about places and things is something I have never seen or heard of except from politicians. If 4 million raging aliens landed in your back yard and wanted you as a snack would you really care about the statue of Paul Revere in one of your parks? Doubtful.If our world were really being invaded I doubt we would give a rip about a monument or two, soldiers may join out of patriotism, more likely family and culture, but they fight in the heat of battle for themselves and their buddy's.Still one of the better hard Military SciFi's"
4,As good as Toni Braxton!,"I echo the other reviews. Great music, great voice. This CD is as good as Toni, Whitney, Mariah, et al, but without the hype (and unfortunately without the sales). And it's two years old without a follow up. Buy it to encourage a new album."
3,A pleasant little disc.,"""Forever More"" has got to be one of the best love ballads I've heard in years. It's well sung by Johnson, and it doesn't have an ounce of the forced emotion you'd find from other singers. The rest of the album is a mixed bag (a little bit of Whitney, a little bit of Mariah, with some mid-tempo grooves), but ""Forever More"" alone makes this worth the purchase indeed. Unforunately, Puff Johnson quietly disappeared shortly after this release, but if she returns, I hope her next CD will be just as good (if not better) than this."
3,It's okay.,"The cleaner didn't do much for my violin. I used it to try and clean the old, sticky rosin off of the wood, and it cleaned a part of it off, however, there is still a lot left."
4,Great product,"Shipped in a timely manner and arrived before I expected it. It's actually called ""Varnish Cleaner."" Worked well on my violins to remove old sticky rosin residue and did not damage the varnish."
4,Good workout...,"This tape has a 4 minute warm up, and then has 3 seperate 8 minute workouts - segment 1 is the easiest and then each segment gets more advanced. Each segment works all parts of your abs. I thought the 1st segment was way too easy, but the second and third are good workouts and you will feel it in your abs if you do the whole tape. There is a lot of variety in the exercises, and the tape ends with a 4 minute cool down."
2,Not challenging,"I got this video because I have the Reebok Hi-Low Impact Video - which is AMAZING, I have been using it for 15 years. And I have the Legs video which is also amazing. The Legs video can be pretty challenging and it really tones your legs. I expected the same with the Abs video. It however is not challenging at all. Maybe if you were 100% out of shape this would be difficult but I got through the first two exercises (10 minutes each)and I felt like I had wasted my time. I haven't even bothered with the 3rd exercise yet. It may be much more challenging, but I didn't want ONE 10 minute workout, I wanted a whole video."
2,Amazon will probably not send you the right thing,"This spy pen is probably great, but I wouldn't recommend ordering it from Amazon because you probably won't get the right thing. Amazon sent me something called a ""Secret Agent Pen"" with Invisible Ink twice before I finally gave up and got my money back."
3,missing my favorite tune!,"This is a good album. But I give it three stars because it's missing THE best song on the soundtrack, a beautiful acoustic guitar piece with a Irish folk lilt that plays just before the end of the film. Why the producers would leave this gem out is beyond me. I would have replaced ""I want Candy"", which everyone's heard a million times, for this one any day."
3,For only certain tastes,"This soundtrack like the movie is only for certian tastes. Either you get it or you don't, there is not a lot of middle ground.Many of my friends who I play the soundtrack for, or sit down and watch the movie with don't understand the humor at all. They can't relate to either the characters or the bosa nova, Wesley Willis, Demo on a Casio Keyboard type music.All of these things remind me of a childhood once lost. For others, the lack of any real tallent isn't nostalgic but rather painful. Much like going to a kindergarden play, or music recital... unless you have a child in the performance its not going to be enjoyable."
1,"Not Complete, Not Worth It.","I wanted to buy the Napoleon Dynamite for two things: the White Stripes song at the beginning and the musical score at the end of the movie. Neither is on the CD. Why these to pieces were omitted is beyond me, but I am glad I discovered that before making a purchase."
4,the dance song is missing....,good stuff!check track one of teh album below for the dance track.http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000J7SR/qid=1114019634/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/002-3294927-8257637
3,Opening Song of Movie?,My favorite song in the movie is the opening song about Friends?I heard it once in the closing scene of House on TV.Does anyone know the name of the song or the artist?
4,Missing Songs Listed,"I would have given this 5 stars, but there were some songs missing I had to go track down--freakin idiots! :)1. So Tuff, So Ruff - Zapp & Rogers (Pedro's Cousins bump music going to the dance)2. More Bounce to the Ounce - Zapp & Rogers (Pedro's Cousins music when kid's bike getting borrowed)3. The Rose - Amanda McBroom (Helping Hands song)4. Larger Than Life - Backstreet Boys (Summer's skit)5. Time After Time - Cyndi Lauper (different version than on CD)6. Music For A Found Harmonium - Penguin Cafe Orchestra7. We're Going to be Friends - The White Stripes"
5,Hm.....,Hey.. i was wondering. Does anyone know the name of the song that Napoleon dances to at the end? ( his big dance number).. if so that would be great...Thanks Alot!..
5,Awesome,"This is a soundtrack to life, best opening song ever, makes you just want to go out and have an amazing day. The memories of the movie come flooding back with each soundbite and make you want to relive all those napoleon moments."
4,"""time after time"" is not the version from the movie","I like the soundtrack.Would have prefered if they put the cyndi lauper version of ""time after time"", which is the one they used in the movie.Instead they used a version by ""sparkle motion"". Probably licensing difficulties.Good stuff!"
4,Where's the best song of the whole movie?,"Unless I'm mistaken and the tune is on the album under a different title, I don't see ""Music for a Found Harmonium."" This was the instrumental piece that was played during the final montage called ""happy endings."" It's really a brilliant piece of music, and it's disappointing that it isn't here."
3,"Loved it, but...","The real reason I wanted this soundtrack is for the music at the opening credits and the ""Music for a Found Harmonium"" version that plays during the montage sequence near the end of the movie.This soundtrack does have a lot of dialogue that wasn't in the film, if that gets you going. It's also got some other great 80s music and the track Napoleon dances to.But like I said, disappointing in its omissions."
4,Napoleon IS AWESOME!,"Just like the movie, this Napoleon Dynamite soundtrack is flippin' sweet. If you're into the 80s-vibe music (like me!) and love Napoleon, Pedro, Deb, and the gang you'll love the Naploeon Dynamite soundtrack from the motion picture, ""Napoleon Dynamite"". It has all the great hit songs from the movie, like ""We are Going to be Friends"" and ""Forever Young"". Reccomended for Napoloeon fans!! :)"
2,THIS IS LIKE THE WORST SOUNDTRACK EVER!!!,"Totally Disapointed, WHERES THE SONG FOR THE OPENING OF THE MOVIE ANYWAY!?!?!, and where is all the 80's songs like when they were at the dance and at the end of the movie. Those damn Hollywood producers dont know whats good, AND HALF OF THE SONGS AREN'T EVEN IN THE F#CKING MOVIE ANYWAYS WTF!!!!!!!!!"
5,awesome soundtrack...gosh!,"Great soundtrack--it covers the whole film, and even includes some scenes with dialogue. We can't help but laugh every time we listen to it while driving."
4,Too funny,Some of the crazy music and some audio snippets from the movie. Also the songs featured in the movie. If you liked the movie this will just be fun to listen to.
5,Napoleon Dynamite Soundtrack,Great soundtrack! Quick snipets from the movie before each song are hilarious - does not bleed into the song for those who are wanting to add just the songs to a playlist.
4,Good Soundtrack But Missing A Couple Great Songs & A Lot of Great Dialog..,"There are songs on this soundtrack that i believe were not used during the movie. I Want Candy, Every Moment, New Mate, Design, Sometimes You Gotta Make It Alone & Only You. If they were used in the movie can someone please list when & where? Also, in the credits, 2 tracks are listed that i cannot find and do not know when they were used in the movie: ""Old School Antics"" Performed by Steve Adams, & You Belong To My Heart"" by Agustin Lara and Ray Gilbert. Overall, this is a nice representation of the movie though."
5,"If you liked the movie, you need to own the soundtrack!","While I agree with the other posters that the The Penguin Cafe Orchestra's ""Music for a Found Harmonium"" is sorely missed, the addition of some of the classic sound bites from the movie make up for it. And as a bonus, you get to hear two clips that didn't appear in the movie! Sweet! In track #18 titled `Locker Room #2', Napoleon gets harassed for being in the `Happy Hands Club'! And in #40, Napoleon schools Don about his `illegal ninja moves'! The original music by John Swihart is amazing, and the classic tunes from the past round it out."
5,Awsome...but????,This is an awsome movie and a wonderful soundtrack. I was very disappointed when I didn't hear Napoleans song he dances to on the movie. If anyone knows it please email me at sweetchik8806@aol.com. Thanks lots.
2,Get your own tots! Gosh....well... instead of this CD,"The artwork on the CD is great... a lyger. The cover is pretty cool, and also the quotes that Napoleon speaks from the movie are hilarious. My favorite quote being about Nessie being blown out of the water. Also, I like the A Team theme song alot as well.The movie is great, but the music isn't anything special by itself. In the movie, it may enhance the quirkiness of Napoleon, but listening to it in your room or car is just plain boring in my opinion, maybe because I prefer full orchestrations.But hey, if you like the 80's, some Napoleon quotes and the A Team theme song, then you might like this CD. Who knows, you can always sell it in a garage sale if you don't like it."
2,A First Book when your in a hurry.,"A good ""Get your feet wet"" book for first time form developers. I read/scanned it in one night as I was looking for more of a ""command line reference"" (does my DOS programming background show?) where each topic/feature was covered in depth. I have a need to develop semi-complex java scripts forms with auto fill features for a production environment, but the needed support and answers were not here. I do not mean to knock the book as it is well written and has a good walk through methodology, but it is not a fallback ""reference"" book when you are in over your head in the creation process."
2,Incomplete and difficult to use.,This is not the book one wants to learn Adobe Acrobat. The authors assume anyone using the book is already an expert in using Acrobat. The glossary is totally inadequate so that many of the terms used by the authors are greek to users. I have been in computers for over 40 years and this one of worst manuals I have ever seen. I bought another book which was of more help but still was not comprehensive enough.I use Acrobat a lot but it has a lot of potential which I have been unable to unlock. Someone needs to write a comprehensive manual that covers every operation step by step. This book did not cut it.
4,"Important Subject, Good Book","My advice is to purchase John Kotter's article that this book came out of from the Harvard Business Review. It's title is ""What Leaders Really Do: How Leadership Differs From Management"". The article covers the subject well enough and I do highly recommend it!! Very Important."
1,Force Lacking,"The book is fine but don't buy the kindle version for iPad. I just bought it. None of the tables, graphs, charts, or matices display properly. This undermines the illustrations, data, and comparisons kotter makes. I'd like my money back"
3,Not what I thought,the JVCC low gloss gaffer-style tape was not what I thought it would be. We needed to order white gaffer's tape for a project and this is different from what we were expecting. Once we openned the box we knew it wasn't what we needed. It is much more like duct tape than gaf tape.
4,"Pop, yes! But it makes me wanna' dance!","This is the only Gloria Estefan I own. I generally can't stand disco/pop and while she's really Latin, she easily fits the pop category. But she's done some beautiful ballad/love songs and her dancing stuff accomplishes what it's supposed to...it makes me want to get up and dance. This CD contains everything Estefan has done that I'd ever want or need."
5,Gloria Estefan Greatest Hits CD,"If you enjoy listening to Gloria, you will certainly love this CD. Everyone of the songs on this CD is true Estefan at her best. You will not be disappointed in choosing this CD. This CD includes ""Coming Out of the Dark"" which she wrote when she recovered from her terrible accident. Also ""Here we Are"", ""I see your Smile"", ""Seeing Christmas through your Eyes"" are fabulous. Love, love this CD."
3,Good Multichannel SACD,"I like this multichannel SACD overall, but some of the surround mixes are a bit gimmicky/distracting. The recording quality doesn't seem much better to me than the CD version. I have to admit that I'm a little disappointed with this SACD, perhaps my expectations were too high, but still like it overall. I received it as a gift and am glad to have it in my collection. But considering what this SACD title sells for nowdays, I'm not sure I'd consider it worth the upgrade over the CD version."
5,"I'm not even a Gloria EsteFAN, but this is a knockout!","Your neighbors will hate you, but play this LOUD! Not just a system show-off, but a system ""stress test"". Great songs, one after the other and spectacular dynamics and production. Another no-brainer!"
3,"Greatest Hits without ""Bad Boy""?","A Greatest Hits album should include all the songs that were big hits. ""Bad Boy"" reached #8 on the charts, and it's left off of the compilation. That's a big error!! People who have this collection know that without this song, the album is incomplete. The best that Gloria Estefan should do is remake the album adding ""Bad Boy""."
2,A Rather Ordinary if Pleasant Greatest Hits,"This CD was a Big Seller upon it's release in 1992, boasting a Plethora of Big Hits, along with some New Songs. Looking back through 2005 Eyelids, it's hard to hear why these songs were so Huge....The CD starts off well, with Hits from the Primitive Love Album, but as One keeps listening, He realizes that None of these songs have Passion or Depth, a few catchy Melodies and Pleasant, if Plain Vocals. The Dance Numbers at least keep You awake, but the Years 1988-92 found Estefan leaning on Ballads, and One was barely distinguishable from another; on top of that, the 4 New Cuts feel like padding, to fill a CD's worth of material for a Christmastime Release...a Couple of Hits are missing, too(i.e., Bad Boys), so to summarize, Nothing truly Bad here, but precious little on Target...."
2,I wasn't too impressed.,"Gloria Estefan is a GREAT artist, but this CD didn't do much for me. The songs practically stayed the same throughout the CD. If you like more upbeat, pop-style songs, this album is not for you."
2,Gloria Estefan - Greatest Hits,"I liked a couple of the songs but alot of the music sounded pretty much the same.Trish,IL"
5,Thank you for this wonderful effort.,"I've enjoyed this cd many, many times and want to thank you for the pleasure it has given me. Unlike other reviewers, I would never compare Ms. Estefan to anyone else - how silly! Unfortunately, I lent my cd out and never got it back. But it is one that will have to be replaced. It has range and depth - maturity beyond Ms. Estefan's years."
4,Gloria Estefan...Where's Miami Sound Machine's credit?,"This is a collection of Gloria's best work from the moment she started with Miami Sound Machine. The album is basically built around her biggest hit with the band, ""Conga,"" a pop dance track that goes down in history as one that should never be remade. Other dance favorites include the hugely popular, ""1, 2, 3,"" ""Rhythm Is Gonna Get You,"" and ""Get On Your Feet."" Gloria tones it down a little with sympathetic ballads such as, ""Anything For You,"" ""Here We Are,"" and her big solo hit, ""Don't Wanna Lose You."" Estefan was one of the few solo artists that made such a big impact in the 1980s and still doing so today. This is a collection that is worth every penny..."
4,Becoming an Organized teacher,Great ideas and blackline masters for organizing a classroom. I love the icons for the writing process!
3,The Organized Teacher - Kindle for Mac,"The information and ideas in this book are very practical and useful. My only regret is that I didn't get a hard copy because the kindle version is not as user friendly. Words in the margins are cut off and there isn't a way to copy the masters (that I know of), so a hard copy might have been a better choice."
5,Extremely helpful book!,"This book is great and a must have for every new teacher! I will definitely be using this book when I start teaching, it definitely eased my worries about a lot of first day of school questions that I had. Highly Recommend!"
5,"Absolutely, no doubt well-written!","Very easy to understand, very useful for novice teachers!!! Teaching is already so complicated as it is, why confuse yourself and spend so much time reading wordy classroom management texts. It's not about the cost of the book It's about how effective this book is when I first utilized it in the classroom. Definitely saved me a lot of worries of how I was going to get the class in order. There are lots of details, yet written in a clean and precise manner."
4,A Cornucopia of Resources for Teachers,"I focus mostly on matters not elaborated by the other reviewers. This book lists several characteristics of children of each of the elementary grades (K through 8), ideas for positive rewards for children of different ages, the deployment of classroom centers, methods of filing important information, indoor and outdoor games, websites for teachers, and much more. As an experienced educator, I tend to agree with the reviewer who suggests that this book is more applicable to the teaching of younger grades than older ones."
5,Great for New teachers!,There are so many helpful hints and ideas in the book. I plan on using it next year when I set up my classroom and all year through with all the great ideas!
5,A great tool for new teachers,"I bought this book as a student learning to put together a lesson plan for an elementary class. I really benefited from this book - for it brought up a lot of great ideas that I had no idea about, being that I not yet had any experience. I would absolutely buy this book again and recommend all new teachers do the same."
3,planning,It did not contain what I thought the book was going to contain about organizing the classroom.The book has quite a few helpful tips to get organized so the book is worth looking at.
3,I'm sure it's helpful for elementary school teachers,I'm sure this book could be helpful for elementary school teachers but far too much of it is devoted to things that do not effect teachers for grades 6-12 :( For that reason I am disappointed.
4,a handy book for new teachers.,"The book arrived on time in a nice condition. Thanks.This book was assigned by my professor for the class. It's a handy tool book for new teachers, so I will keep it."
2,OK for brand newbies,"I was hoping for a book that would give me ideas on managing a 4th grade departmentalized 70+ student population, grades, assessments, benchmarks etc. This book was great if you were setting up a K-3 classroom of 22 students, however it was very little benefit for me at this grade level/point in my career. I will hold on to it, just in case I teach a younger grade and am clueless about what to do."
5,LOVE IT!!,"This is such a useful tool for teachers. It is simple to use, visually stimulating, and fun!! Really great book!"
2,Could be better ...,"Although I appreciate the effort of making a film, watching a home made travel video in hand held style with poor sound quality and very basic editing was not what I expected from this title. In order to sell a video on DVD the standard needs to be higher."
2,Too much about too little and with no index,"The book is very technically in depth in the areas of fault detection, evaluation and then an explanation of fault tolerance in distributed system and extending QoS. The book does not seem to follow a logical flow and is thus very confusing.The book could serve as a valuable reference if it had an index. Since it doesn't, I failed to find the value of the book. This is a shame because I think if this extra time had been committed (for the index or other cross reference lists) then it could have been valuable."
1,"dogs, a startling new understanding of canine origin, behavi","This book is very poorly written and very redundant throughout. The authors seem to take some pleasure from continuously posing esoteric questions, instead of just trying to provide some straight forward useful information. There is nothing that is particularly startling in this book, as the title trys to suggest. The authors should remove all of the subjective and quasi-conversational text from this book and submit it as a paper to a journal."
4,Very pleased with the DVD-R version,I've been looking for this movie on DVD for several years. The DVD-R version from Retro Flix is very basic; it does not include any menus or extras. However the black and white images are excellent and the sound quality is very good. Thanks to Retro Flix for making this movie available on DVD!
2,Forever Friends: A Record of our Friendship,This is a really neat book to make for a very special friend. There are places to record special aspects of your friendship as well as to include pictures. I received the book quickly after ordering.
4,Great Gift!,"I got this book (Forever Friends) for a birthday present from my best friend. We had a sleepover and we both filled it out. It took forever, but we had a lot of fun remembering all the good times."
5,greek waters pilot,Just what I would expect from Rod although I haven't used it yet. He is the best I have come across
2,blowhard,"this book is a FIRST. the first memoir by a WW2 combat veteran who wrote home boasting of the number of men he killed. He was NOT the most decorated 82nd airborne soldier. As a WW2 infantry veteran myself, I respect his sacrifice but he is nevertheless a windbag."
3,WAR,"Good story, well written, Great insight. Proud to be an American. I would read it again and I would recommend to anyone>"
3,"Decent, but lacking a clear voice","I have been reading military history since the age of 11, and as a combat veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan I can relate to many of the themes brought forward in this book. I salute Megellas's service and sacrifice -- I do not believe our country will face the large scale combat of WWII and all the associated horror's and bloodshed again -- he fought and did what he had to do and what he felt was right -- and this book reflects him being apart of something enormous in scale and comprehension.But, as an author, Megeallas never seemed to find his voice. I found the book and associated narrative lacking and wandering. Descriptions of events switched back and forth from macro strategy to micro actions of fellow soldiers, leaving the reader wondering who he was going to quote next. If the writing had been tighter I would have rated it higher."
5,An Extraordinary Memoir,"I have read over a hundred WWII memoirs. Most were marginally interesting but otherwise unremarkable. James Megellas' ""All the Way to Berlin"", however, is exceptional. I would rank it along with E.B. Sledge's ""With the Old Breed at Peleliu and Okinawa"" as the best of ordinary combat soldiers' memoirs. His description of the attack across the Waal River in Operation Market-Garden is worth the price of book alone. His willingness to write frankly about the brutality of combat is in stark contrast to many of the sugarcoated memories written in the decade following VE day.It is, without doubt, an important contribution destined to become a ""classic""."
5,A True Story of What Happen to Our WWII Airborne Soldiers.,"Absolutely a great read! The narrative that Lt. Megellas uses keeps the reader's wanting to know what happens next. A truly overwhelming autobiography that tells us what our All-American airborne soldiers had to do to keep alive. James Megellas has revealed to the reader the mindset that develops in combat over time, when life becomes rather cheap.During the years that my father-in-law -- Lt. Richard ""Rivers"" LaRiviere (see this book's dedication) -- was alive, he shared several stories about his life in ""H"" Company of the 504th. James Megellas versions were true to form and exciting to re-hear in his All the Way to Berlin.Having been awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, two Silver Stars, two Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart, Lt. Megellas has the expertise to deliver a real picture of WWII combat; a reality that he successfully brings home to the reader. (by Gary Zimmermann, Marine veteran of Vietnam, Nov.67 - Dec.68 & Jul.69 - Feb.70)"
3,Has its limitations,"In concept, this is a great toy. I love that it is wooden and not made in China. You whack a ball and the next one pops up.Problem is that nothing really keeps the balls in the thing. It is now sitting empty on my living room floor (after 10 days of play) and I have no clue where the 1 yr old (or maybe his older 4 yr old brother) has put the balls."
2,Get a different hammer & ball toy...,"My son was about one when we bought this for him. He had zero interest in using it as it is made to be used. The balls were all over (a couple are missing now) and the hammer is mainly used for other things. We thought he would ""grow into it,"" but at two and a half, he still has no interest in it's real function. For around the same price we could have gotten a more interesting Plan ball & hammer toy that he would have enjoyed more."
4,This is a keeper...,"This toy is pretty cool. I bought this for my 9 month old for x-mas - you have a constant stream of balls to pound and my older son likes it - he's 3 - and he played with it for quite a while. I am guessing the 9month old will grow into it, but he's a little young for it at the moment. It's made out of nice wood and seems like the type of toy you could keep around for future kids (or even your kids' kids someday...) - as opposed to cheap plastic toys."
1,doesn't work,Product arrived with one of the balls too large to go through the track to the other side. One of the red balls just sticks and has to be forced through. Way too difficult for my grandson. I have trouble pushing it through. Ugh.
5,Love it,"I love this toy! And my 1.5 year old nephew does too. We both like hitting things with hammers, so it was only natural that this toy would be a hit with both of us....lol."
5,"e-Healthcare, The Revolution is Underway","Goldstein provides a timely wealth of information in an easily readable format. The information is well documented and very futuristic; rather than the more typical books that talk about what's already happening. Excellent resources and examples are offered to depict relevant points. I think this is the most comprehenisve book on e-healthcare available today. It is a valuable read for practitioners, managers, and students interested in building core knowledge."
5,What to do and when to do it.,"I bought my copy of this book directly from Ron Brown ages ago. I think it cost me a fiver for the large hard cover book, so it must have been some years ago. Ron died not long ago, aged 97. It is useful in that it has sections for beginners, improvers and senior beekeepers, taking them through the beekeeping year, month by month. I have always recommended it and have lent it many times to beginners. If the person who has my copy now reads this, I'd like it back please!"
4,Nice work,"A book that I would recommend.Full of useful information and well written.One criticism would be that it could do with some more pictorial descriptions of what the text is trying to convey, as some of these processes are lengthy and reasonably complex to understand through reading alone. So you may have to read things 2 or 3 times and then draw your own picture or list of what you are being told to do.Otherwise I'm glad to own a copy."
3,It glows,"Note that this toy just glows. It does not actually cast any light. In fact the instructions inside the box say, ""The flexible cables and tips will glow red!"" That is a true statement. And it is in fact pretty neat to see the cables turn red with light. However, it does not actually cast a beam of light, and thus it cannot illuminate anything. As a lover of flashlights, my five year old was a bit disappointed to discover that. The product description should be more clear."
2,osteo 3 by vet solutions,company did not provide vet solution product ...instead it was replaced with another companies osteo product..the only reason i kept was due research of the company which turned out to be favorable
5,Works great!,I bought this mount for the Garmin Quest. I use it on my '98 Harley Electra Glide. This mount work GREAT! I have it right on the handle bar and when the GPS is not mounted you can barely tell it's there. The GPS snaps into a holder that snaps onto the semi-permanent mount that stays on your bars. Works like a champ and the best part is that the GPS can easily be removed when you get where you're going. If you use your bike for long trips or just like to see where you are this works great.
1,A insult to a good series.,"I enjoyed that games series. I find it rather annoying that now, someone has released a book by the same name, that covers the Vietnam war. Isn't this the war that Bob Dylan was talking about when he wrote It's All Over Now Baby Blue? Isn't this the war that officially ended American innocence?The games where about heroics, being as good a human being as possible, this book is just about death. While I will admit that the name of the book seems to be sarcastic, it is sad to see such a great title dragged through blood drenched mud and slaughter.Also, shouldn't someone be paying Vivendi for using the name? I mean they do hold the rights to the name..."
4,1984 CD,Bad encoding? It plays fine but could not transfer songs to MP3 player.What a great soundtrack. Too bad it was not bundled with the Eurythmic's version.
3,Been around and some,"This is a good album, I am long time if not forever fan of the Ozark Mountain Daredevils and am glad to see them releasing some new music and re-releasing some of the older albums that have not been availibale on cd, give them a hand, and if you have not listened to them before, you are missing a very good band."
5,Don't pass up this one.,"Just received my copy of ""13"" and it's a classic. Will be one of your all time favorite OMD recordings, just like all the rest of their music."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE: Poor Durability and Customer Service!!,"I purchased this horn, had it professionally installed, and it worked great for 4 months! Then it started to not work when it got hot. Finally, 2 months later it died. I had the wiring checked and there is nothing wrong with the installation. The device just does not hold up. I called Amazon and they were no help on getting me a replacement. Finally they gave me the website for the manufacturer. I left them some feedback and 2 weeks later have not heard from them. I told Amazon not to sell this product any more. If you are reading this, they still are. I strongly suggest you NOT purchase it!"
4,loud horn. nice sound,"I was looking for a horn that makes that classic sound, and I got it in spades with this one. It's ridiculously loud.Only not a 5 because the base was cracked when i got it. still works fine, just annoying."
1,Broken after 4 months,"I had this product installed in a 2009 Subaru. The sound was too high pitched, and didn't have the same satisfying sound as classic aoogah horns. After functioning for under 4 months, it has broken.It cost me a lot to get it installed, and now it's garbage."
5,horn,"The horn works good. It is loud and has a real oogah sound. It should be mounted so it is protected from rain, as my old one died when it got filled up with water."
3,Sounds Great,Horn sounds great. It is a good thing it is cheap because it only lasts about 1 year and you will need to purchase another It has a great sound while it lasts. I don't think it likes to get wet?
3,review,First item was defective but Amazon sent a new one even after the 3 month return date. Have yet to put it in yet but I am sure it will be fine!
4,Il like it,"Recently I bought the FIAMM 66059 OOGA Horn - 12 Volt ""Old Fashioned Sound"", I decide for this one specifically because of the FIAMM brand, is an old and recognized brand that I'll been using for years in my cars, but in the envelope that comes, even in the horn , theirs no brand on it, impossible to know, I don't know if a pay for the brand or any brand. Besides of that, the instalation was easy, blows and sound great as promise, priceis right, the delivery time was on time. If you want to enjoy with your friends, specially with your children, I'll recomended this one.Fernando R"
4,An In-depth Examination of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,Jess Nevins website includes panel by panel detailed descriptions of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen helping out anyone who is struggling with picking up the numerous references in the graphic novels.Inscribing all of the vital annotations to the website Nevins also jams this volume with essays on the archetype of the Victorian characters as well as an introduction and exclusive interview with Alan Moore.Great for any collector.
1,Minimal quality,"I was extremely disappointed when I received this book - its poor quality was so obvious, I hardly wanted to look through it. Contrary to other opinions listed here, the quality of printing and of the photographs is quite low. The cover is printed in [...] shiny, and not matte, paper, and the photographs are largely out of focus, like a bad Terence Conrad book from the 1980s. The choice of interiors is also misinformed - many of the furnishings appear dated, and even ones that might be nice are poorly photographed. There are other far better books out there - don't get this one."
1,Is the price of the Kindle version a joke?,"You've got to be kidding. I would love to read this, but at $20+, there is absolutely no way. Come on now."
4,100 not so beautiful people...,"Goldberg gets it right. At least for each person on his list that I recognized he gives a stinging, and well deserved, tongue & cheek critique. In this book you get the well cited DL on people you won't get in the so called mainstream press. Some of the other names I did not recognize, in all fairness, may or may not have deserved his disheveling. Nonetheless, the book was very entertaining and could be conceived as a retort for the 100 most beautiful people put out by People. I say Goldberg should publish a top 100 list every year. I would buy it & read it!"
4,Try judging the book by its cover,"First of all the book is not titled ""THE"" 100 People..., it is simply (some) 100 People and you can tell from the little pictures on the cover that he is taking aim at people in popular culture. So, enough with the reviews about how this book missed the REAL 100 people who run everything. Bernie is trying to sell books, not put people to sleep.Secondly, for the reviewers here that think he is trying to capitalize on Al Franken's success by adding (and Al Franken is #37) please remember that Al's first bestseller was ""Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot"" Hello? Who's the name dropper? Irony alert?So, for what the book really is I give it 4 stars."
4,"its not to bad, in fact its pretty good","it really is pretty good, it puts the scumbags in the spotlight and tells them how they suck. i also like this because the worst people are liberals if not all of them. i especially love how micheal moore the anti-american jerk he is, is numero uno.let me leave you with this closing remark:GOD BLESS AMERICA THE GREATEST NATION ON GOD'S GREEN EARTHyes i do recomend this book"
4,Great book super funny,"This book is full of laughs and even though I don't agree with all of it. It's definately a fun read. I love the part with Michael Jackson all writes: Need I say more? LOL that was too funny. Good book, Good read."
2,A great let down.,"I was excited to pick up this book at my local store, but was quickly disappointed as I began to read it. Lacking any real substance, it is essentially an amateurish blog in paper form. Some of the chapters are amusing reading, others pointless diatribes, and most rehashing of complaints against easy targets. Nothing new to really read. The best option is to pick up the book at a local library and read the first few chapters, which are the best the author has to offer.I really had hoped the author would provide substantive criticisms of the people he chose, but rather he just presents his own opinion of why he doesn't like them. Even though I agreed with a number of his choices, I was hoping for more.For Courtney Love, all he says, literally is ""ho.""Not worth buying if you ask me."
1,Missing in Action!!!!,"Like so many other Americans, I have to agree that this list is totally biased and worng. I am a Republican who belives people like Geroge W. Bush and Dick Cheney whose names should be right at the top of this list too...conveniently aren't. Sure Howard Dean is a nut and Michael Jackson is probably a child molester but there are so many right wing conservatives who are destroying America equally with the far left liberals...does Jerry Falwell ring a bell or how about Pat Buchanan who came out to blame liberals, homosexuals, and abortionists for 911!!! How un-American and absurd is that! Don't waste your time or money on this garbage."
5,Liberals should pay! Round them up!,"Thanks for pointing out the real poison in our society - liberal entertainers. Too many stupid liberals try to place the blame on the people who make and enact the laws of the land, like our poor, besieged Dear Leader. We should add his name to the pledge of allegiance! That would show those stupid, unpatriotic, anti-American liberals!!!This book is awesome!!!!!!"
2,disappointing.........,"I was really looking forward to reading this thinking it would be a balanced book, but is wasn't even close. A book that is so biased and partisan is of no value at all because it looses all credibility.....just reinforcing hateful thinking from those on the right and further inflaming those on the left.Those of us in the middle just throw up our hands and contemplate moving to another country. It's just so sad to see what this country is coming to."
1,Just Unbelievable,"The stupidity contained in this ""book"" is almost beyond comprehension. Jimmy Carter is #6? I understand people taking issue with his presidency. But when a kind and decent man deeply committed to social justice and basic human rights is determined to be one of the Top 100 People Screwing Up America, there is a problem. And yes, there is a problem. Many of them. One of them is with the individual that wrote this book. If you think intolerance is funny, then you will find this book downright hilarious. If you find Bernard Goldberg funny, chances are that you are a scary, scary person and don't even realize it."
4,I Mostly Agree,"While I do agree with a large sum of his choices, and I do enjoy his writing style, my tastes do not always fit with the masses.This is an editorial book, the opinions of one man who believes that a great deal of our culture is under assault and he wishes to speak a rebuttal. If you do not like opinion pieces, and want a more fair and balanced spoofing of government and society in general, you should buy something from one of the mentioned good guys of this work, Jon Stewart. If you are looking for a comprehensive list of the republican party's biggest opposition and weakest members, then this should be a good political piece for you.I prefered his other book Bias, which I found to be a more informative tomb of information related to the media, and an interesting personal account of a reporter."
2,Bernard Goldberg on the Daily Show... Ouch!,"Goldberg appeared on The Daily Show with John Stewart promoting this book. Stewart normally is a silly, unthreatening interviewer but he went after Goldberg and really skewered him. Stewart demonstrated that Goldberg's claims of balance were nonsense - this is a straight-up right wing hatchet job on left wing figures. More to the point, Stewart asks the key question...do you really feel the need to describe Barbra Streisand (for example)as one of the 100 people screwing up America? One of the 100? With all the problems we face, this is who you identify as the problem? Stewarts exposure of Goldberg's triviality, and Goldberg's apparent inability to even remotely defend his choices, was an eye-opener."
1,Unfounded generalizations.,"I found his characterizations of ""liberals"" totally off the wall. He failed to recognize all the liberals that fought for feminine rights, Civil Rights, individual rights and freedodms, etc. As a minister who marched and ""sat in"" during the Civil Rights movement and who was spat on and cursed by ""conservatiives"" I found the author's paint bruch too broad to be helpful.I certaily agree with some of his personal parodies against people who are just nutty extremists. But I find these people on both sides of the political fence. But, I doubt anyone would appreciate ""Conservatives"" being confined to Nazi's or KKK types."
1,Who's screwing up America?,The only entertaining aspect of this book is the fact that someone wrote it seriously. This is simply ridiculous right-wing banter.But he is right on one hand... Barbara Streisand is REALLY screwing up America. Come on. Don't waste your time.
3,"Entertainment at times, boring and upsetting MOST of the time","Isn't it funny that not once did he mention a single conservative in the book? Some of his remarks are correct and easy to relate to. But way too often he uses examples of speeches given by the ""offenders"" that he completely takes out of context. He also way too often gets too fired up over opinions that do not match his. By the end of the book he was making me mad, not interested - it is not possible that someone would be so narrow minded as to think that only liberals, scientists, teachers, and intelectuals (never conservatives, by the way) are the only ones screwing up America. A read that makes for good conversation but does not add much in reality to your life."
3,Correction,"This is just to correct the person that said the Iraq war has cost us 20,000 deaths...the death toll for American soldiers is less than 2,000 as of Sept 16 (according to anti-war websites). That's over the course of 2.5 years and is still less than the number of civilians that were killed during the attacks on Sept. 11. BTW, I don't agree entirely with his list or his arguments, but he makes a good point on a lot of these cats."
2,Don't buy it. I beg of you,"Although Goldberg does have some strong points regarding the cheapening of American culture, this book isn't worth reading. I don't mean to spoil the surprise, but, no one in the Bush administration is in this book. Simply ridiculous. Hmmmmm...... Is Barbara Streisand really screwing up America more than a man who sends 1500+ kids off to die for no reason? You decide."
5,The truth hurts for some people.,"Goldberg is 100% correct. Not only are these people screwing up America, they're also a threat. Ever hear of the Rico Act?"
2,Unenjoyable,"This hardcore conservative did not enjoy this book. The book is filled with a wealth of eye-opening information on significant people that I did not know but should (like Hugo Chavez's new best friend, Noam Chomsky), but the reading is so laborious and draining that I cannot recommend it. It has none of the light-hearted fun that we often get from Rush Limbaugh. Rather, it brought to mind the dark experience of listening alone to Michael Savage in a bad mood after dark. The cheeky title is misleading - this was a joyless book to read."
4,No need to read the reviews...,"If you're a Republican, you'll enjoy this book, except for the extremists who will be ticked off that Michael Savage is on the list and Bill Clinton is not.If you're a Democrat, you'll hate it.It's funny to me that so many Republicans have written reviews about how great the book is, and so many Democrats have written reviews about how horrible it is. It's like switching between FOX and ABC!Nearly 950 reviews?! Come on, the title tells you exactly what you're getting. My rating is based solely on its entertainment value."
2,One Man and People Who Piss Him Off!!!,"This book has an entertainment value, BUT it is basically just some guy talking about all the people who piss him off. Instead of actually talking about the people who are really ""Screwing up America"" it is about one man's vendetta against Democrats and/or people who have just rubbed him the wrong way."
5,Finally someone is speaking up for the 'silent majority'.,"Thank you for speaking up for the 'silent majority' who have been beaten into submission by the elitist, politically correct, arrogant, intellectual thugs. If they would only realize that honest IS the best policy (I suppose their response would be something like ""that depends on what the meaning of is, is"").A very well written and entertaining book."
1,Bernie's partisian selective memory.,"Bernard Goldberg has a very selective memory. He forgot that Dick Cheney told Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont to ""go $@$#yourself"" on the Senate floor. Sounds crass to me. Too bad Bob Novak didn't meltdown sooner, Bernie could have overlooked that one, too."
2,Very One Sided,"I read this book and found it to be very one sided. Goldberg himself admits there are mostly liberals on his list, however, I was shocked to not only read that they were all liberals, but who some of them were. I agree with quite a few of the selections. I think the world would be better off without Michael Moore, however, I also believe the world would be better off without Bill O'Reilly. I think even many conservatives would agree that he should definitely be on the list, but he is not. I think that for the most part the people that are screwing up America are both liberal and conservative, and I think they both deserve places on The List."
2,Here's another one...,"I lost track of how many times the author contradicted himself after the first 40 pages. It always makes me laugh at how all of the conservative talking heads whine about how out-numbered they are in the media. They're either talking a lot louder or they underestimate their own presence, because they're all I ever seem to hear today. Although I agreed with a VERY small number of points that Bernard Goldberg made in this book, this was largely out-of-touch drivel. At least it wasn't as vicious and insensitive as Ann Coulter (who's mean-sprited garbage is described by Goldberg as being done with ""a twinkle in her eye"").I defend Goldberg's right to his opinions, as I do everyone's. I guess I just wish that books like this weren't as popular as they are. Afterall, I bought a copy."
1,This book is missing at least 250 million people.,"While I agree that some of the people of the list are absolute pieces of work it is not fair to blame the current state of affairs on them. The real problem is the average American, the guy that sits on the sidelines or stares at the wall doing nothing while this country goes down the drain."
1,Don't Believe it,"In an effort to look unbiased the author tries to pass this book off as a non-partisan, both liberal and conservative bashing book, when in reality it is simply a liberal bashing book. And the ironic thing is, Mr. Goldberg himself is part of the Media Elite he so harshly criticizes.The best part of the book is when he names Michael Moore #1. He gives no explanation as to why he named him number one, indicating that Mr. Goldberg has no argument or justification. He simply places an out-of-context quote under Mr. Moore's picture and expects us all to be content, just taking the author's word for it."
1,"with thousands of people dying in iraq, im glad michael jackson is on this list","this is the most ridiculous book- a distraction from the real issues.to my knowledge, barbra streisand, al franken and this entire list combined are not resposible for the mass casualties of the president in office.so yes, the awful economy, the quagmire in iraq, and the corruption that is karl rove are what is screwing up america- not al sharpton."
1,Jimmy Carter should have been #1,"How? How is Jimmy Carter #6?I see that (...) on TV building homes for the poor and I just want to scream.The guy has only earned one (just one!) Nobel Peace Prize!When I hear him showing concern for his fellow man, talking about equal rights for all, I have to run to the bathroom to vomit.Thank god the diginity and grace he has shown since he left the White House, will probably never be repeated.Jimmy Cater is the devil."
3,"Though not in complete agreement, I nodded A LOT!","I bought this book after seeing Mr. Goldberg on the Today show. I was not sure what I would think after reading his book and was surprised to find that while reading, I was nodding more than shaking my head. I liked Mr. Goldberg's style of writing - similar to how I reactively think - but I did find him a bit repetitive. He also made a lot of sweeping generalizations that made me roll my eyes and skip ahead a couple paragraphs.Outside of this, what I do agree wholeheartedly with is that we ARE becoming a very vulgar, rude, and cynical society. And while I don't necessarily agree with everyone he is pointing the finger at, he hits the mark more than he misses."
4,Telling the Truth,"Bernard Goldberg has done it again! He is not afraid to tell the truth, as ugly as it may be. His facts are well researched and, therefore, difficult to refute. If more Americans would be honest with themselves they would realize that he is right on track. When did Americans stop thinking for themselves and appoint celebrities to speak for them? I don't need ""movie stars"" or ""athletes"" to speak for me or my family. One look at the conditions of the majority of their personal lives would confirm that most Americans are smarter than they are and capable of stating their own opinions."
1,huh?,"None of those on the list run America or any part of it. Most are opposed to those who currently do. So if you had to have this list, why not those who were screwing up America? I'd bet most average Americans wouldn't even know who 90% of the people on this list are so how much influence can they possibly have? I like how Howard Stern & Jerry Springer are taken to task for crass content and then his entire entry under Courtney Love is ""HO"". Guess even Goldberg is influenced by the declining state of our manners. If he made it 50-50 between the left and the right, I'd say cool. This is just another useless right wing diatribe (just as useless as a left wing one)."
1,A Really Stupid Book,"The book is essentially right wing propaganda and not worth anyone's time. If anything, it simply exists to make a really bad, slanderous, neo-fascist propaganda book appear high on Amazon search list results for political topics about the USA."
1,No one with real power listed,"This list is so off the mark that it is laughable. None of the people on the list actually have any really power and can truly affect American lives. If this list was seeded in reality the first 10 listed for screwing up America would be: Rupert Murdock for running the worlds biggest smear machine, George Bush for bringing dishonor to the United States by lying, Dick Cheney through his corruption, Karl Rove through his traitor's acts, Donald Rumsfield through his stupidity, Bill Frist through his willingness to interfere in private lives, Tom DeLay through his lawless actions, Dennis Hastert failure to lead impeachment proceedings, Rick Santorum for his promotion of child abuse through his support of a corrupt church and Robert Novak for being a traitor.This is a book that only a non-thinking dyed in the wool nut could love."
1,This book is ridiculous,"The title attracted me at first, but once I actually started reading I was very disappointed in the lack of substance. I am sorry, but I thought this was going to be a list of 100 people who are actually screwing up America-you know, the people who make decisions and therefore have screwed America in the process. Instead, many of the pages were filled with celebrities, who actually have no decision making authority and therefore have not technically screwed up America. They're just annoying. And yeah, I understand the author might have a little problem with the opinions of Michael Moore (#1), but at least he wasn't the one who made the decision that has cost, and still is costing, many people their lives. Now THAT'S screwing up America for ya."
1,Are you kidding me?,"What an angry, untalented man Bernie Goldberg is. Apparently, Osama bin Laden is ok, since I don't see him on the list, but people who follow the ""moral obligation,"" as Teddy Roosevelt put it, to question our leaders decision making are the real problem in this country.Can't wait to see the notation next to his book on the Times best seller list indicating the bulk sales by Townhall and the rest of the wingnut websites and organizations. This should be on the 50% off shelf within a few weeks."
1,Godlberg IS what is screwing up America,"Anyone who thinks Eminem, Jimmy Carter, Ted Kennedy, Al Franken, John Edwards, and Micheal Moore (who is #1) is about as screwed up as most of the individuals HE claims to be screwing up America. This book is dumb, idiot, and totally unorthodox, right-wing media. DO NOT BUY!!!!!! and do not waste your precious hard-earned money on this trashy book."
2,Not as bad as I feared,"I was prepared to hate this book - just from the pictures on the cover, I was sure it was going to be a completely lopsided attack on liberals, and liberals only. I was a bit surprised to find that he did take aim at a few right-wingers as well, enough to get an extra star from me. For nailing Michael Savage, David Duke and Ken Lay he gets some of my respect. For admitting that the ACLU has done some meritorious things he gets a little more. Overall, however, it was a rehash of stuff I can hear any day on conservative talk-radio, so I cannot recommend it as something profound or thought-provoking. If your conservative leanings cry out to you to read it anyway, just get it from the library and invest the $$$ instead."
1,Oh puhleeese!,"If you think Fox News is fair and balanced, and it's a good thing that huge corporations are buying our politicians and ensuring the total destruction of our planet within the next 40-50 years - buy this book - knock yourself out.Or - you can join the good guys.Eric Winter"
1,"62,040,606 Voters Who Screwed up the World.","Every Bush voter should write an essay on why they're sorry and how they'll try to make up for it through volunteering, community service, going to confession, etc.Then these essays can be gathered together and published in one book, with the proceeds going to pay for this war and for restitution to the families of our fallen soldiers."
2,sucky as sucky can be,"I only read about the first 20 pages of this book and had to put it down. I put it down and came here to warn everyone about this book. It's no good. The list by far is retarded. yes celebrities are landmarks of the Usa, but in no way affect us like the ones that sent the military across the sea. Or those who decide it's a good idea to increase gas prices because we'll take it.I recently read a book called Dope by Robert j. Escandon. The book talks about the problem with the system of society. It talks about a large device that will engulf and entrap those who make our world worse. Enjoy Dope and forget this book."
1,What a f---ing terrible book.,"If there's a worse book, I hope I never have to go through the experience of reading it. Say what you will about it, but any list that does not include Ann Coulter and Anne (Teletubbies) Wood is as reliable as a comatose goat.But it has more flaws than its omissions--which include Blockbuster Video and a lot of other companies who are doing just as much harm as single people. The writing is perhaps the most terrible you will ever find in a book; if anyone gives a favorable Amazon review to this piece of sh--, they are just guessing about its quality."
1,Straight up stupid from a guy I didn't think was a moron.,and he and O-Riely was crying about how the liberal people who can say things anonymously are incredibly vile in their reviews of book and what not.Guess what? Thats my real name on my Amazon reviwed by lable.
1,I would sue if I were these people...,"Leaving right-wingers omitted, this book solely bashes all liberal thinking, left-wing celebrities, etc. It is the least balanced piece of trash I have ever read, and I was a journalist for some time too. I would have been expelled in college for writing a biased piece like this, but this author gets rich off of it. Please spare yourselves and read the plethora of other, more balanced works out there today. This is far too radical to be worthy of reading. By the way, I am fairly left-wing myself, but I feel the same way about Michael Moore, so I'm not saying this just because I disagree with this author."
1,"Dumb, Dumber, and Dumbest",This complete self-serving trash! This facts are not justified. The reasons for making this list are arbitrary at best. This book is a complete waste of paper. The publisher (and author) must both be idiots. I wish I could rate this lower than 1 star.
1,Pure garbage,"This book is simply garbage. First off - the title. By putting Al Frankens name in it, are you 1) trying to ride off his popular book 2) working for Fox News now?The list is predictable. It is full of Democrats, with just a few Republicans sprinkled here and there.The big question - why are people like Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh, who make it that if you vote for a Democrat, then you hate your country and are stupid, why are these two not on the list. They are everything he says Al Franken is. Actually, they are worse. So why pick on Al, but not list the conservatives? Because this book is pure Republican.Bernard wanted us to feel sorry for him in Bias. Now I start to see why CBS wanted nothing to do with him. Last night on Bill O'Reilly on Fox News, he was crying how the major stations don't want to interview him. Bernard - it is because your book is garbage, and your views are one sided.Skip this book."
3,Great GOP Propaganda,"This book is great for those of us who believe that the GOP should be judged differently than Democrats. The people mentioned in this book like to point out the double standards, lies, mismanagement, cronism, adultry, nation building, budget busting, and the double speak of Republicans because they are Un-American. The try to ruin the reputation of our great President because he was failed businessman, a draft dodger of sorts, an oilman who could not find oil, a leader that has taken more vacation time then any other (and he still has 3 years to go), who hates to read, takes naps, and goes to bed as early as many grade school children. Obviously these people are envious of the man that represents all that is great about American Conservatism. Finally these people are angry at the party that is giving tax breaks to the top 1% because they are jealous that they are not millionaires and therefore losers."
1,what a piece of @)$_*@#_@!,"Well, I thought that we had sunk pretty low with all the scandal books out there on both sides. But this book sinks even lower than that. This author just takes pot shots at people who don't think like he does. Just because you don't agree with someone doens't make them wrong. And by the way, I am an everyday american working overseas- I have seen how people like this author have hurt our reputaion worldwide- and Mr. Goldberg Certainly Doesn't speak for me!"
3,Lieralwocky Personified,"While this is not Goldberg's best, it is an interesting expose on those who live their lives under the mantra of ""My mind's already made up, so don't confuse me with the facts."" All you have to do to see this in action is to read the reviews of those who trash this book. Since they cannot refute the arguments, they engage in ""personal destruction"" or ""character assassination."" While those on the political left cry out about ""fairness,"" what they don't have the honesty or courage to say is, ""fairness according to my views, which anyone who disagrees with me has no right to question or oppose."" True liberals -- like Alan Colmes -- understand that the marketplace of ideas is open to all, regardless of political, economic, or religious ideology."
5,Its about time....,"Mr. Goldberg has written a refreshing and brutally honest expose that takes aim at many of America's elite. He spares no one regardless of profession, ethnic background, race, or economic position. As I read the pages of 100 People Who are Screwing up America I kept laughing aloud. I was continually surprised and elated.It has always been a curiosity to me that many of the people that owe this country the most are the very same people who seem more than happy to tear it down. Mr. Goldberg deals many of them a blow and sets the record straight.If I have anything critical to say about anything he writes it would be where he places certain people on the list. It might be interesting to take a poll of where the average citizen would place these ""usual"" suspects on a scale of 1 to 100.This is a must read for anyone who is fed up with the intellectual and hollywood elites."
5,Right on the Money!,"Great book! I know that the Democratic Party my grandparents believe in is not the party of today. All of the people he lists ARE contributing to the deliquency of this country, and a few more he doesn't list. Those of you who don't believe the author are living in denial or have been so brainwashed to accept the ""truths"" these liberals spew to the public. News flash! There IS a conservative on the list. I highly recommmend this book to anyone, especially those who need to wake up and see the condition of this country and the cause of it."
4,What now,"The book ""100 People"" highlights many things wrong with America, however, America really isn't all that bad. Just look at the money and effort put forth by Americans across all economic and social levels plus numerous foriegn nations coming to assiast the victims of Hurrican Katrina.As for the shortcomings described in the book, many are right on, however, what can an individual do to stop or reverse the nonsense going on???"
5,Go Bernie!,"Goldberg openly admits that this list is HIS list and that others may disagree or have their own lists of those whom they think are screwing up America. Those who take a liberal bent will not enjoy this book and will continue to align themselves with the likes of Michael Moore, Al Franken and Ted Kennedy. I found it an illuminating book with some informative commentary on some famous and not so famous individuals influencing the United States currently."
4,Just another entertaining personal point of view.,"This book sits on my bookshelf next to my collection of dilbert books. Really it is a fun read with some intereting insghts. Nothing earth shattering her but will give you something to read while sitting on the throne.If your a die hard liberal, the book will probably make you tear your hair out as he trashes you nearest and dearest gods.If your ultra conservative, its probably best for all of us if you do not read it, lest you add it as another section of the bible.For the rest of us,if your interested in books that poke fun at a few of our finer wind bags in America, this isnt half bad if you have a few bucks sitting around. Nothing to jump out of your seat for. The fact that it pisses so many people off may make it worth the price though.As for my personal views, i agree with alot of his points but do not know if the names given are tbe best examples, but they are well enough known ,i supposed, to explain the authors ideas."
4,Won't Please Everyone- but a good read,"Overall, this is a pretty good book. Definitely good for some laughs and for making one aggravated at the hypocrisy of many of those profiled. Most Democrats and liberal leaning folks will find fault with Goldberg's choices for his list, but I think he reasons each one out fairly well. As he states in his prologue, any type of ""list"" is subjective and no one is ever going to agree 100% with the author's choices. No doubt, Goldberg leans right, but he is fairly middle of the road politically. Conservatives are not left unscathed and many of Goldberg's choices are people I don't necessarily associate with any political philosophy other than self aggrandizement and greed at others' expense. Overall a good book, an entertaining read which makes some good points- but don't expect to agree totally with the author regardless of your political persuasion."
4,Enjoyable!,"I was suprised so many people faulted him for basing this book on his opinion rather than fact. He readily admits in the opening introduction that this list is completely biased by his own opinions and conservative leanings. He also admits that, had this list been compiled a few years earlier, it would have leaned far more towards the liberal side than it does. I was also suprised that people expected this to be serious political discussion. The title should tip you off to the fact that this is more social commentary than anything. All in all, this is an entertaining book, and has some interesting points. It was fairly well researched I thought, and had some interesting takes on a lot of the starlets and celebrities that hollywood is so quick to praise. No, I don't agree with all of them (although I was delighted to see Paris Hilton's parents, Laurie David and Michael Moore in here) but it's still an interesting and entertaining read."
4,Good book,"This is a good read. Some of the people mentioned are not well known, so I cannot comment on their appearance in the book, but I certainly agree with Goldberg on those whose names I do recognize, although not always in the sequence that he places them. Still, Goldberg points out the absurd conduct of a lot of the bad actors in our country."
1,Takes my breath away,"A man who compiles a list of ""100 People Who Are Screwing Up America"" and fails to include Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, or Bill O'Reilly simply isn't trying hard enough. Or he's simply engaging in the kind of ""crap"" (oops! may I say that word here?) he accuses Michael Moore and Al Franken of.I mean, after all, the man includes Barbra Steisand in his list (presumably so he could reach the magic 100 total so necessary to his title) but omits four of the foulest members of the Right, four people who give a devastating new depth to the term ""jingoistic""---and please, please, don't confuse that word with ""patriotic!If he'd have published ""104 People Who Are Screwing Up America"" and included Limbaugh, Hannity, Coulter, and O'Reilly, he may have demonstrated enough pseudo-credibility to earn another star and maybe even a laugh instead of a sneer of derision from this reader."
5,100 People Who Are Screwing up America (Al Franken Is #37),Very Fun Read. Talked about it at work and home.
1,what hypocrisy!,"""WHY DO SO MANY AMERICANS who ought to know better find the United States such a terrible place?...""Later in his introduction Mr. Goldberg writes that the problem with liberals is that they ""only criticize Americans"". Excuse me, but isn't this a whole book written about Americans Mr. Goldberg doesn't like? It seems the only difference between Bernard Goldberg and these 100 Americans that he so fervently holds in low esteem is that Bernard Goldberg's party is in power.My review of this book? Toilet paper."
4,Insights into Popular Personalities,"This is a non-fiction book that discusses 100 of the people in the U.S.who are well-known and sometimes controversial and what they are doing and have done to the detriment of ouor great country. It has been said that great nations do not fall from the effect of forces outside but from decay within. It can be said that almost without exception these 100 people are contributing to the decay of our country, especially in a moral, spiritual and political sense."
4,100 People Who Are Screwing Up America,"This is a MUST read for anyone who can handle the truth. Irrespective of political views, Professor Goldberg makes his points cogently and pursuasively. I say this as a social progessive who believes in patriotism and fiscal responsibility.It may be too much of an awakening for those in denial. Too bad! Read it and learn."
1,a Great 'perty' book. a Million laughs! (AT the content.),"Barbara Streisand is screwing up America? HA! She, and most of the others mentioned, do little more than 'express their views' of how we are being strippied of our constitutional rights. If 'Free Speech' is ""ruining America"", then it's time to have a garage sale at the white house!This book should be kept in every bathroom. It's a joke, and the pages are soft enough to use if the 'roll' runs out!RKPembroke Pines, FL""Liberals feel unworthy of their possessions. Conservatives feel they deserve everything they've stolen.""~ Mort Sahl~"
1,The Worst,"A right wing hatchet job that I can only describe as slimy filth! This guy will say and do anything to make a buck. He woulkd fit in perfectly at ""Filth News""-We make it up and you decide-. This is was such an awful, disgusting read I am surprised I made it to the end! Bernie, you are such a JERK!"
1,"Oh, please!","Yeah, I read some of this garbage at my local bookstore (no way would I give this guy any money) and he's just one more creep making a buck by angering other people in a divided country. What a jerk.I love when guys like this start talking about the cultural elite and ragging about how they are all liberal. If the elite were all liberals the Dems wouldn't have so much trouble raising money. The elites are mostly Republican, but they give money to whoever is in power. As far as the culture going downhill, why doesn't he go after the right's godhead Fox News founder Rupert Murdoch. There isn't a poop joke, shouting match or midget plane pull he won't trot out on his network for a buck. Cutural elite my arse!I hope that some day soon we wake up and give the boot to all of these creeps. Left, Right and in the Middle."
3,Not quite there yet,"Not bad but Mr Goldberg has some ideological problems to work out. He actually thinks ACLU(American Cluless Union)has done some good. Boy, is he in denial. Definate slant toward the left here. Please, Mr Goldberg move further to the right. You are so close."
1,Just politics....,I heard an interview with the author last night and the guys doing the interview mistakingly thought that the mock interview w/ Al Franken in the book was real. The author seemed very embarrased while trying to explain his rational for doing this. It all seemed very akward. The author came across as very biased and politically motivated in the interview. Quotes in the book were taken out of context and I found nothing of any real value. Franken should look into a possible lawsuit against this clown.
1,"Actually, it's 101.","It seems that Mr. Goldberg left himself off of this list; an accident, I'm sure. This book rates a great big yawn: yet another conservative wacko representing his views as ""the truth,"" which necessarily means that the views of anyone who disagrees with him are ""lies."" Instead of wasting everyone's time complaining about how rotten the left is, why doesn't he come up with a solution to get the left and right to work together to improve this country? That's what we need right now, not a lot of hot air and hate-mongering (and that goes for both sides)."
1,"And the #1 ""Person Screwing Up America"" is . . . Surprise . . . Michael Moore!","I hate to spoil the ""surprise"", but now you don't have to buy this piece of literature, or (as I did) dirty your hands in your local bookstore to find the picture (yes, this book is heavily illustrated for its illiterate target audience) of the right wing's public enemy #1 on the last page.Do these mouthpieces of the far right have anything left in their own defense other than these endless repetitious ad hominem attacks on the usual suspects?"
1,Black rednecks and White Liberals,"Above is the name of the other book I ordered, which never arrived.Shabby."
2,Where's Rush Limbaugh??,"Limbaugh is the mouthiest, most widespread perpetuator of hate and misinformation. Hiding under the guise of an ""entertainer"", he also claims to espouse the truth. His mouth and his ideas are dangerous. His ego has had to damage the part of his brain that deals with logical thinking because I would hate to think that someone so successful can truly be that shortsighted and narrow minded. The only use I have for him is as some of the best examples of logical fallacies and poor reasoning when teaching argumentation to my students. I hope the author did not leave him off because the author is ""conservative."" Limbaugh isn't conservative--he's elitist. I do, however, agree with many of the other additions to the list."
1,funnier than Franken,"This guy is a hilarious satirist! The author's persona of a fanatical, right-wing lunatick undeterred by reality is perfect. Many will think that this is a serious work, don't be fooled, just sit back and laugh."
5,An Amazingly True and Entertaining Book,"This book is both true and hilarious. I couldn't agree with him more, and whether you agree with him or not, the book deserves a read. Don't judge the book by the backstabbing attack by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show. The book is fantastic, and most people would agree that the vast majority of people in the book as screwing up America. It's not about politics- it's about culture. It's a quick, fun read, and hopefully will open up some narrow minded individuals' minds."
5,So Right In Picks,"I don't think anyone in this book is harmless and we should take notice of them. Ted Kennedy is no Jack Kennedy, and for some reason Barbra Streisand (and others in show biz) want to convince the ""poor or middle class people"" that they ""understand"" their plight, when in truth they haven't a clue as to how the every day person lives. And Howard Dean? He's just an idiot altogether."
1,Distractions,"The premise of this book is that we should forget about the people who are controlling things and instead worry about how our culture has (supposedly) got much less civil over the years. I have never really bought that. I think most hollywood movies are crap, but I hardly think they are causing the collapse of American empire.So don't worry about the middle class squeeze, or Americans dying overseas. Worry about Michael Jackson and Mike Moore. While your at it look over your shoulder for the boogie man, the wendigo, and vagrant trolls."
1,The Main Screw Up?,I was wondering why George W. Bush wasn't number one? He has done more to screw this country up than any president I can think of! Getting us into an endless mess with Iraq that is a HUGE money pit and is NEVER going to go away. I still don't know why he dimwhittingly chose to do it. There must of been a reason? It has done way more harm than any good (I've haven't seen any good so far). This author for some reason chooses mainly to blame people in the media instead the policy makers and corperations that control the Country.GET A CLUE!!
1,Here we go again.,"Why should this surprise anyone? Yet another essentially psychotic rant from the ozone layer of the far right that projects one of their own's paranoid madness onto various objects of celebrity. This crap gets so boring. It's good reading if you like accidentally self-parodying hogwash, but don't read it for anything beyond more of same ole same ole of right wing inflammatory hysteria. Heart disease, hypertension and stomach inflammations aside, here's some more of the right's bad ideas and bad medicine."
1,100 People Who Are Screwing Up America (And Al Franken Is #37),"A typical neocon rant disguised as a book. I get turned way off whenever I read something that first attacks the personhood of others, and then engages in exactly the same logic-actions that it criticizes in others. Freud, who was not a liberal, refers to this process as projection.I might listen to the conservative point of view more often if they didn't preface everything they put out there by attacking and disrespecting anyone who disagrees with them."
1,More Lies for ignorant People,"Another piece of propaganda disguised as ""pro-American."" This trash has nothing to do with American values or freedom. It's about silencing and censoring. It's against anyone who questions ""Republicans"", not people who bash America. This is a book for people who put party before country: Republican first, American second (or third, fourth, etc.)"
5,A must-read!,"Finally, someone willing to expose the hypocrisy of the Left-wing ""tolerants"" that are tolerant of everybody except those that don't agree with them! This book is a must-read; biting social criticism that is right on."
1,Garbage,"The book is absoutly garbage, I actually wanted to give a 0 rating but it wasn't one of the choices. Yes, I am a liberal. However, I'm one to listen to both sides of any story before forming an opinion, that's why I bought this book.First of all, Goldberg in my opinion didn't have an original thought of his own. All he did throughout the book was quote someone else. He's so anti liberal he ought to take a long look in the mirror and maybe he'd see why liberals are liberals.If he think that someone who think that not naming storms with the representative of black names is screwing up America well, he seriously has a problem. It's trival and petty and didn't warrant a place in the book. Sure,it was to poke fun but it's stupid and I believe that he has given the topic some serious thought or he wouldn't have written the book."
3,"Fun Read...In A Simple-Minded,Way...","As a person who is an independent thinker,I learned to get to the,""meat"",of a story by using what I call,""left-right-center-keep.""(I.E.,subject:Bush'43. Read NY Times' take on Bush;then,read The Wall Street Journal's...kick out the left spin;then,kick out the right spin;therefore,leaving me with the facts on Bush'43). Before reading this book,I was hoping that Mr. Goldberg would use this concept with this book. Sadly,after finishing this book,he didn't. Therefore,if you are the type who lives for bashing Liberals;then,this fun read is for you. In a simple-minded,way...it is entertaining for a very light read."
4,An Honest Opinion,"Most people who give one star reviews to books steeped in politics usually have no concept of what the actual book is about. I found that most of Mr. Goldberg's comments were innocuous enough. However, I would like to state that there are a number of liberals on the list for a reason. That aside, I thought the book was very entertaining and I would rate it with some of Anne Coulter's material."
3,Easy summer read,"I enjoyed both of Bernie Goldbergs' earlier books Bias and Arrogance (I wrote a review for the former) but found this book to be somewhat lacking in substance. The crux of the book is Bernie lists 100 people who are screwing up America and gives you WHY they are srewing up America. Some of his reasons are brief like, #98 Courtney Love - Ho! Bernie hits all areas of American life from Politics and Media to Sports and the Business World. The one thing you won't find in this book is solutions to ""stop"" these people from screwing up America. It is an easy read for the beach or sunning in the backyard.PS To the reviewer who noted that GW Bush isn't on the list please also note that John Kerry, Bill and Hillary Clinton are NOT on the list."
4,An Insightful analysis,"Mr. Goldberg has written what amounts to a short-book length editorial. He clearly spells out his thesis and consistantly applies it to his ""victims"". This is not strictly a liberal versus conservative analysis (although, the Libs are noted far more often), but rather more of a dissusion of manners and basic honesty. He points out some real movers and shakers who do not always make the headlines, and there are several suprises. This is not just a ""bash the Democrat"" party.Overall, clear, rational, thought-provoking and educational."
5,His #2 is #1,"Loved ""Bias"" but this book is even better. As a former television news cameraman...I personally experienced much of what Goldberg writes about in this book, in different locations with different news media ""stars."" Great read. Can't wait for his next book!"
4,Read Carefully...,"In my opinion, the best way to enjoy this book is to strip off any personal political beliefs and affiliations, and just dive into the book. It may be hard, but just try to see the other perspective. Even if you disagree with the opinions Mr. Goldberg gives, don't just ignore the facts he presents. It's not as if he made them up. Form your own opinions about the facts. The book is a real eye opener, if you can open your mind up to read it."
5,100 People Screwing Up America,"I just LOVED listening to Goldberg's choices ! ? Hearing the author read his own book helps YOU understand his choices.Quite an INTERESTING, ""uplifting"", extremely INFORMATIVE piece of literature!A MUST READ FOR EVERY LIBERAL !!!"
2,Slam-Bang Effort,"I agree with most of Goldberg's views on politics and culture. He can also turn a phrase. But this weak effort is mostly pro forma, cashing in on his earlier best sellers."
1,Goldberg tells women to shut up on live tv,"Has anyone seen this man actually speak? He's a rude, cynical, self serving bastard. He told Linda Staci to shut up on live television because she asked him why didn't Rush Limbaugh make the list.At the same time a rolling stone writer pointed out that he ranks the ""Unknown American Terrorist"" someone who is trying to kill people, further down the list than someone as Howard Dean or Michael Moore. Valid point. What a waste of trees this book is.http://movies.crooksandliars.com/Donny-Deutsch-Bernie-Goldberg.wmv"
1,Ad Hominen Abusive Runs Amok,"One of the first things I learned in college logic was a list of logical fallacies. At the head of the list was the old standby, Ad Hominen Abusive. When you can't refute your opponents argument with facts or logic, just smear the person making the argument. If you don't like universal health care, call it ""socialized medicine"" and the person who proposed the plan a ""pinko"", ""fellow-traveler"", ""communist."" Considering middle america's aversion to homosexuals accuse the proposer of being a ""closet queer"". This book is one, long ad hominen abusive. About the only good thing I can say about it, is that if you tear out the pages, it will make good kindling when you're trying to start a fire in the fireplace.This review is by Arthur J. Farkas, a San Diego moderate who is thouroughly sickened by the trash that passes for political discourse in this country."
1,The contents of this book is what is wrong with America,"America, we do not have a chance. This trashy book is what is wrong. Please think for yourself. Investigate from multiple sources. Do not let this person make youe quotes for you. WE ARE Hurting and most Americans don't even know it. Within 20 years, we will be number 3 or 4, behind china, Europe, probably Africa. /because of the Bush Oil Prices. Follow the money. Think if you are able (be sure to cut the TV off)"
1,Guess What??,"AL FRANKEN is TELLING THE TRUTH about WHAT's GOING ON IN AMERICA, AND he's LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK!!!!"
2,Good Idea,"But it is an extremely biased book. Written by a right wing nut is it any wonder that the vast majority on here are Democrats, or liberals whichever you prefer to call them. Some how Michael Moore is more dangerous to this country than George W Bush. I guess the author forgot who was in charge of the country during September 11. 2001. It's just a good thing this book is about people today who are ""screwing"" up America, other wise if he did this though out all of Ameircan history Bernard Goldberg would of listed heroes such as Franklin Roosevelt, Benjamin Franklin, JFK, Theodore Roosevelt and so forth. Nice idea though, listing the 100 people who are messing up the nation, but he got the wrong people! Not Reccomended, instead I reccomend reading the constitution."
1,"Dear Mr. Goldberg,","Just finished reading your ""100 People"" book and I must say I cannot WAIT until I get to be a spiteful old curmudgeon and appoint myself to publish a list of all the people who annoy and offend me. Congratulations!And kudos on working-in the whole patriotic theme that's so hot right now. I mean, identifying them as major enemies of the country? Brilliant! Who else but you has that kind of hutzpa? Okay, Ann Coulter maybe, but she is so 'lunatic fringe' and you are so 'mainstream.'Please don't worry about SO many people saying you named so many CBS network folks because of personal and professional 'sour grapes.' It's like I keep telling everybody, Bernie doesn't have a CBS-bias, he just loves America! (all the way to the bank!)Keep Ridin' That Tide, Babe,With Love,Tebbiki"
3,"Okay, I guess...",For the most part this is an interesting book. I can't say that I totally agree with Mr. Goldberg's on a lot of what he has to say but then again everyone is intitled to his/her opinion.
1,Yawwwwn....,Jimmy Carter is screwing up America? Jimmy Carter is screwing up America? Jimmy Carter is screwing up America???Nuff said.
1,sigh..,at first I thought this book could possibly be interesting but quickly found it to be 320 pages of hate filled diatribe. very disappointing.
1,"Want to stay the course of socializing poverty and terrorism in America? Then, this book's for you !","For all the luxuries Goldy-berg is enjoying working in the ""liberal"" media he complains about, a book like this just shows that Goldberg should resign from media business if he doesn't like it or he should have fought against it but all he does is whine and bathe in taxpayer money !America has had enough of soap opera media while the real war mongers in DC have taken this country to the ground. With rightwing political wackos like Limbaugh, Stossel, Goldberg, O-Reilly, Coulter, etc ... showing their love for Al Queda, this country needs no more enemies."
1,Way Off,"I would have given 0 stars if that were an option.Funny I didn't see Ann Coulter or Rush Limbaugh on the list. Not to mention the #1 screw up, George Walker Bush."
1,Does anyone actually care what this man has to say?,"What's the proper recourse to this mind-numbing drivel? To write a book about the top 100 conservatives who are ruining America...with a few token (and blatantly obvious) liberals thrown in there? It really boggles my mind that so many people prefer a growing divided America, by devouring these hate-filled piles of trash, over a united America. People like Goldberg pander to the lazy and weak-minded. If you're one of those, I fully expect a five star rating. Enjoy."
1,100 People Who Are Screwing Up America CD,The ordering and delivery of the product was first class. The product rant and content stinks. It is just as suspect from its point of view as Michael Moore is from his. DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT.
5,"finally, the truth","This book is a very important counter to all of the liberal smearists out there. He points out how hypocritical they all are. They make fun of our president when he is leading us in the war on terror. The people in this book are the REAL problem. They think that fox news is bad. At least they report the FACTS. They say that Bush and Chaney are unnecessarily killing people. Wake up! They are protecting our country from terror and protecting us from immoral acts like homosexualism. They say that religion is destroying the world. I feel sorry for them that they don't understand the God can save them from their depravity and ignorance. You lost the election. Quit crying and get used to it. No wonder they hate this book. The truth hurts. Open your mind, buy this book and learn the REAL problems. You will thank me for it."
1,Bernard on The Daily Show,Did anybody else see Jon Stewart rip into this guy? TV can be so satisfying...
2,The Liberal Bias on the Cover,"If you don't think this book has a bias against liberals, then just look at the cover. 6 of 8 people on the cover who are ""People Who Are Screwing Up America"" are prominent liberals.Look, here's what's wrong with America. We, as a country, are way too focused on OTHER countries. Not fixing our own country. We spend way to much time and money on OTHER countries, and we can't blame liberals for that. It is in fact the conservative internationalists in the Republican party who have put our military in over 100 countries and tried to turn us into a modern empire. I think Bernie is off the mark in his analysis."
1,Goldberg is a Basher with book,"I sat in Barnes & Noble for several hours and read about 1/2 of the book (I am now glad I didn't purchase it !!). The book reads like a gossip column book and one actually walks away from the book with the impression that Bernard Goldberg is the number one America Basher. His credibilty for me was really 'shot' when I saw that he included Bill Moyers ... and the way he underhandedly uses a third person to justify his inclusion of Moyers in his book.One other note, the other night (7/20/005), Goldberg was on a national talk show and actually screamed at one of the talk show quests to ""SHUT UP"". Actually, he told her to shut-up about five times because she was not agreeing with many of the premises and justfications for the Americans on the list. Not only was Goldberg out-right rude, but provides evidence of why Goldberg gets my nomination for the American Basher of 2005!"
1,I guess it pays to be an Uncle Tom,In the great tradition of Clarence Thomas Goldberg makes money by lauding those who despise them.
1,A Silly Coffee Table Book,"This is such an embarrassment! We have a president who lied us into war in Iraq, yet this author thinks that liberal entertainers are ruining America? There are thoughtful conservatives writing today, but Goldberg certainly is not one of them. What serious person actually believes that entertainers, conservative or liberal, actually have any real political clout? Harper Collins should be ashamed of this silly volume!"
4,A very lilliputian list of lilliputians!!,"I wish Mr. Goldberg had had more time to make this into a heavy weighter book. The book seems to have been written in a rush and does not probe more deeply into more details of the caused damage.It addresses the stupidity of these people as the central theme, and that is a no brainer. I would have hoped Mr. Goldberd digging into the consequences and the real damage this people are causing this country. I invite Mr. Goldberg to write about the institutions (National, multilateral, private, etc...) that are also hurting this country big time.In spite of the above, I must admit that I had great fun reading this book; although some of the names I had never heard of, but it was good that Mr. Goldberg tagged them very specially, getting some of this obscure names into the spotlight. Moreover, the list is rather lilliputian and needs to be expanded...Good job!!"
3,Interesting (and sometimes funny) but sneakily biased,"I purchased this book because I really like Bernie's segments on HBO's Real Sports program. I figured that he would be insightful and revealing just as he is on that show. First, I'll say that he is. The information about the people listed in this book is interesting, sometimes funny and often outrageous. What is dissapointing is that it is ""one-sided"". Mr. Goldberg writes almost exclusively about ""liberals"". Are we to believe that there are no ""conservative"" people in this nation that don't belong on this list? I was really hoping for more balance. I'm not sorry I bought the book - it is entertaining (somebody really should do a television expo on Larry David's wife... she's apalling), but it could have been a truly good work if Bernard Goldberg had been a journalist (as he so eloquently defines every time he names a peer on the list) and presented a balanced point of view or at least disclaimed his intent in the blurb or prologue."
2,Just an angry man makes you feel angry,"He actually made a list of 100 guys and I first thought I'd be amused to see all the facts. But then, I just saw an angry man standing up there and bursting out all the witty profanity. Can such an angry man reason impartially? He's just another screwball and he might be #38. Definitely a waste of time, don't buy it"
1,Divisive claptrap,Two words describe this book succinctly: Divisive claptrap.There is nothing more that needs to be added.
5,Lefties defensive even here!,"It is SO funny to see the ""liberals"" get defensive even here!!GET AN AGENDA OTHER THAN CRYING ABOUT EVERYTHING!"
1,Right wing ideologue's list of people who he disagrees with,"This list is, with only a few exceptions, a right wing ideologue's list of people who hold views different from his and therefore are bad people. How dare anyone hold positions different from his!A list of miscerants who made this country a far more selfish, vulgar, and cynical place that leaves out hate mongers like Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh! What a joke! A list that leaves out dirty trickster Karl Rove! This is an insult to people's intelligence.Any objective, unbiased list of people who are screwing up America has to put George Bush and Dick Chaney at number one and two. No one has done more to divide Americans against each other than the ""divider, not uniter"" Bush. Even more importantly, none of the people on Goldberg's list has caused the death of more than 1700 American troops, the injury of a lot more, the the death of thousands of Iraqi women and children. None of the people on the list have produced huge government deficits."
1,Ignorance is bliss!,"Goldberg reaffirms our original consenus that conservatives are indeed the most ill-informed ignorant species on the face of the earth! It is embarrassing enough that our country, ""Roveland"" is being lead by a complete idiot, must we honor the rantings of a tired, cranky old man with airtime? The majority of the people on the list have attempted in their own way to expose the evil empire - does Goldberg honestly think we are that stupid? or is he just running interference for the true culprits - the conservative media and the Rove/Bush Administration?"
1,So hypocrisy is now a virtue?,"The author leaves the most morally corrupt Americans off his list! Surely this requires a sequel to the book. Where is George Bush on the list? He sent thousands of Americans to die in Iraq, yet risking death for America is something George was not willing to do personally. Or how about Dick Cheney?Dick got a multimillion dollar severence from Haliburton he was never entitled to, and then (no surprise) his Halliburton buddies get a no bid contract to rebuild Iraq. And why no Catholic priest on the list? Many of them lecture us on sexual mores, yet molest our children! I demand a peoper sequel to this book."
1,100 people who are screwing up america,tom delay.newt gingrich.rush limbaugh.pat robertson.sean hannity. ann coulter. jerry falwell.karl rove. bill o'reilly. brit hume. john gibson. andrew napoliatano. michelle malkin. dr. laura. michael cabbage. dennis miller. glen beck. ted nugent. cal thomas. george will..bur. dr. james dobson.dr. james kennedy. joe scarborough. bill kristol. zell miller. matt sludge. rick santorum. lucy goldberg. (and bernie goldberg is#37) wow that was hard.
1,what a joke...and it got published,"This book is the poorest piece of literature that I've opened in many a day. I'd give it a zero if I could. When it started out, my first impression was this guy harped too long about what's being shown on television these days. Hey, I don't like all that crap either, but jeez, enough already. And then here he goes blowing off about people whose names are barely recognizable. He unloads about like Ann Coulter and I was foolish enough to actually buy her book. I was a whole lot smarter this time and checked this one out at my local library. I noticed that some kid had taken an ink pen and scribbed all over some of the pages, and later I thought the kid had the right idea. I can't finish reading this book because it absolutely bores me to tears. It's a rotten shame books like this get published. And just for the record, I read Al Frankin's book and it was a whole lot better."
1,Right Wing Ostrich,"So rappers are to blame for the decline in political discourse and the explosion of cursing? So I guess that means that Cheney and Bush are big fans of Eminem and 50 Cent. As we all know these guys use the infamous ""F"" word (not to mention the ""N"" word), the only conclusion Mr. Goldberg can derive from that is their obsession with rap.Goldberg is just another Right Wing Ostrich that hides his head in the sand (or elsewhere dark and stinky) and ignores the complexity of the cultural horizon in this country. To focus solely on the left as the source of all that is wrong, is foolish. Sure, folks on the left make mistakes and get some things wrong. But that is equally true of folks on the right. Goldberg's myopathy on this point is why his book is meaningless."
1,Jimmy Carter?,"If this author wants to help America in the here and now, I fail to see how adding a Nobel Peace Prize winner and advocate of Habitat for Humanity which helps lower-income people become responsible homeowners and involved in the building process to the list is logical.Perhaps this elitist blowhard should do some menial labor and see the look on the family's faces when they are given the encouragement to succeed. How is he not ruining America by insulting a man who was a farmer, a president, and humanitarian?Most of the list seems fine, though leaving out hate speech advocates Coulter and Limbaugh....I don't see how they are less harmful than Carter. Bizarre.Maybe trying to make a buck off of the ""controverial list"" hype?"
3,"Everyone has an opinion,","For the most part this was an entertaining read, can't say that I agree with all of it but nontheless I found it entertaining."
1,100 People Who Are Screwing Up America?,"What number was Goldberg himself in this trite piece of pseudo-journalism?Nice book that is exactly like the garbage it attempts to make fun of.If Paris Hilton were a writer, she would be Bernard Goldberg."
2,A former Democrat sells out,"I was a huge fan of ""Bias"" and I'm sadly disappointed to see that this book is nothing but the ranting of an angry, bitter man. Goldberg is a former Democrat who has now decided to cash in on the current trend of hate-filled, right wing, info-tainment that has taken over our popular media.Goldberg's book has the same appeal as that of gangster rap, angry talk radio or sleazy daytime television. He criticizes those who appeal to the lowest and most negative aspects of human behavior in order to make a buck, which is ironically, the very thing he's doing here. So I would like to propose that he add one more name to the list: his own."
1,hmmmmmmmm,"Surely the people screwing up America are its own ignorant citizens? I don't mean to be rude and stereo-typical, as I know they aren't ALL living in ignorant bliss/fear and supporting a corrupt and evil government, but all the wealthy tourists, which I have met whilst they visit my country, are extremely childlike in their world knowledge."
2,Fox News Worldview,"If you love Fox News, listen to Limbaugh, Hannity, and Liddy you will love this book. It's really just more of the same ""America, love it or leave it"" crap we heard during the Vietnam War era. Goldberg is an angry and bitter man who had a humor by-pass operation somewhere along the way as was evidenced during his book promotion appearance with Jon Stewart on the Daily Show. It seems that people with his worldview are incapable of objectivly hearing criticism about the polices of our country without feeling the whole idea of America is threatened. I would suggest the author expand the list and include himself."
3,Our Basic Right,"This, like so many other books of our times on politics and our country, ignores our basic right. I agree with Peter Green. Free men in a democracy have the right to screw up their country, their government, and anything else they like. That is the meaning of freedom. Many do not like this and there is currently a longing in our society for more ordered times. Freedom is just that: freedom. So this book is meaningless. What one really hopes is that there are enough safeguards in place to keep any one person (or group of people) from destroying our country. This is what happened to ancient Greece."
3,An unfortunately shallow book about shallow people,"After enjoying ""Bias"" so much, because I felt it contained an important message, I was somewhat disappointed in this book. Goldberg apparently wants to make a serious point that I'm sympathetic towards -- that our society is increasingly influenced by those whom are essentially shallow and selfish, rather than those whom are principled and reasonable -- but also seems to want to get some cheap laughs by tossing in easy targets for ridicule. And, obviously, he could have made the book much more credible by including many more people on his list from the right side of the political spectrum. In fairness, though, he makes it clear that this is nothing more than his personal list of the social vermin that can undermine a civil society."
4,"Former Liberal delivers another ""tell it like it is "" book","The truth hurts, just read how angry the other reviews are by obvious liberals and that should be your clue that this book hits them right in the gut. Bernie just tells it like it is. A really good read for the summer, humorous too."
1,typical right wing ranting,"I try to remain open to all points of view, but this is typical right wing reactionary drivel that is ranked only by how loudly and more controversially the ""author"" is. I guess this makes right wingers feel that much more content in their self-righteousness, and in doing so, are able to disparage people who don't march to the party line. It does nothing for people like me that are interested in different points of view that are somewhat based on fact and not on the amount of kool-aid one has to drink with the rest of the crowd. Title should read ""Bernard Goldberg is #36"""
2,Very Slanted,"The writer is very talented and has been the recipient of Emmy awards in various categories. This book was mildly interesting, yet quite disappointing. Although most people could come up with a list that is similar to what the writer ha posited here, maby weaknesses do exist. The writer seems to yearn for a return to the ""good old days"". The biggest problem that this reader encountered was the writer using a black /white situation as he went through his list. This approach was found to be simplistic in nature and tended to spesk down to the reader. Life is quite complex with various hues of gray existing. The pontification of the writer takes what could have been a most interesting read into the depths of the maudlin."
1,More of the same from another mouthpiece with blinders,"More high-horse drivel from the same people that have the nerve to say progressives are ""elitist"". In shooting down some of america's top policy & public figures, Goldberg pines for a country American by name only, medieval Brittish by practice."
1,George Bush is screwing up America!,"What this author fails to realize is that America really IS a screwed up place, led by the hypocrites on the right. The people he lists in his mean spirited book are just pointing it out. Only some pretty messed up people could be ""pro life"" yet in favor of the death penalty and the bombing innocent babies in a foreign country that hasn't even attacked us. They're not Christian as I was brought up to understand the term, because all they do is hate people who are different. I don't know how they live with themselves."
5,Bullseye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Could Not have said it better!!!!Liberals have quite the agenda........................""Oh, we forgot we lost the House and Senate and Executive, ergo, we have NO ideas!!!Typical response of a Lib!!!!!Thanks Bernie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Beware:plenty of liberal bashing,"This writer is upset with the loss of civility in the American discourse. Wow, he seems to be the ketttle calling Moore and Franken the pot. I was really disappointed because in interviews he stated he wasn't a conservative, Clinton basher but most of the people on the list are well known Liberals. Amazingly enough Rumsfield, Cheney, Rove failed to make the cut. Don't be surprised by this book. If you wan't to read up on the lastest liberal bashing then borrow it from the library"
1,I've Read More Interesting Stuff In Nutritional Facts,It didn't take me long before I realized that this book was garbage. This man seems to have few valid opinions and is not very open-minded. The humor he utilizes makes little of a case for the book's legitimacy - it seems almost to be a C-grade Maddox or other crude social commentary. I would not recommend this.
1,Pure Propaganda....,"I have to give the right wing conservatives in this country this: they are very good at Propaganda.This book is nothing more than that, Propaganda. Goldberg does not try to fix the problems in this country, site those that are the real problem, or even make any arguments. Instead he just sites a slew of people (most Democrats) who are trying to tell the truth, and belittles them. The objective is to make you think these are ""bad"" people in some way.It's another sad day for America. Who loses? You the American people. Health care is unaffordable, young Americans have gone to die for oil interests (trust me, not freedom), the deficit is growing, China is buying our country, and the list goes on."
5,A Cracking Good Read,"Certainly, Mr. Goldberg targets many liberals in his book, and why not? But he also targets the conservativees and plutocrats who are also doing their best to screw up this country, such as Michael Savage, Jimmy Swaggart and Key Lay. If you're a principled conservative, you'll love this book; Libertarians will like it, too. Should a principled liberal ever be found, I'm sure he or she will admit to liking it as well."
3,Its the AVERAGE American who is to blame not 100 people,"Now I will agree that many of the liberals whom he lists arent my favorites when it comes to public policy or popular culture. But how can 100 people be messing up society? Since I own all of the authors books I am as a big time moderate, surprised as others are that Anne Coulter and Rush Limbaugh aren't amongst the few conservatives listed as being part of the problem.What about the hundreds of millions of apathetic Americans who in my humble opinion are the real culprits when it comes to who is to blame for the coarseness, vulgarness and lowest common denominator state of affairs the country is in?Since I read books from all points of views, this is an easy read and for summer reading its fun. But if you want a really GREAT book that is intellectual and will make you a wiser person, please read 1776, by David McCullough. Heck read ALL of his books since he is an A+ author."
5,Right On Bernie!,"Bernie Goldberg was right with Bias and right with Arrogance and now he's right again with this book. Sad thing is that most book stores ""bury"" conservative books in the back shelves even when they're bestsellers. Liberals are great at supporting viewpoints unless they're conservative! This book appeals to the majority of America which is conservative. Big surprise (not) that the liberal entertainment industry and media want to lampoon this book. I hope Bernie continues to write books that call liberals to task for the utter non-sense in which they conduct themselves. As long as they deny they have a problem, they'll never regain a foothold with middle America!"
5,Everyone should read this book!,Goldberg speaks frankly and honestly in a hysterical book. He is neither absurdly conservative nor does he bow to media pressure. An entertaining way to be aware of the behind the scenes goings on of powerful people. If only everyone could read it....and listen.
4,Enjoyable afternoon read,"Coming from a college student who is literally swarmed by left-wing educators, students, and media on a regular basis, this book was quite refreshing. There were times during the election when I could not sit in my living room because of the bias which was masked as popular college programming on our television. In particular, the 'Get Out and Vote' MTV campaign, which smacked of the underlying pro-Kerry/democrat message, bothered me to the point that I stopped watching the station all together. I couldn't stand it that my television suddenly knew how to think better than I did. Thus, reading material like this was gratifying in that it wasn't trying to tell me what to believe. Instead Goldberg's message was delightfully frank. If the media wants to make a point in the future, perhaps it should try Goldberg's straight-forward approach. The 'ignorant 58%' who were, amazingly, wise to the media's election schemes might then be more willing to listen."
1,Obvious right wing trash,"Any book that doesn't include Bill O'Reily, Shawn Hannidy, and Anne Coulter is obviously bias. The book is just proganda. For every liberal named there is a conservative who does equal and similar damage to the country. It would be naive to think that one party always makes the right desicion, yet the book is majority liberal.Michael Moore is number one. I only see him trying to hold acocountable the people in office who make poor descions. It's their desicions that are screwing up America, not his or any celebrities. I think it's time Americans focus on their politicans and not their celebrities.If America is getting any worse it is obviously do to the increasing competition for jobs and wealth. So many jobs are outsourced or taken over by illegal immigrants. People have to do things like steal, sell drugs, become prostitudes just to keep their head above water. What's screwing up America is politicans on BOTH sides allowing Americans to go jobless and homeless."
1,A PERFECT BOOK IF YOU ARE NARROW MINDED,"Despite what Goldberg says, this is a book written by a right-wing nut for other right-wing nuts. It's not well written and wasn't even fun to read. Don't waste your time and money."
3,Betwixt and Between,"Mr. Goldberg is interesting in this latest work, but the text does not live up to the title. The introductory chapters offer some key insights on severe national problems. The discussion about each of the 100 people is flat. I expected to find a few unfamiliar names but 90 are virtual unknowns.I Recommend reading Mr. Golberg's first book, ""Bias"" instead of slogging through the 100 names."
1,and Bernard Goldberg is #101,"I wanted to like this book but other than the title, it's pretty boring and worse, it's simply mean. Perhaps Goldberg decided there was much more money in hate than objectivity. Too bad for Goldberg that #37, Al Franken is a much better and much funnier writer, even if you disagree with his politics."
5,Jimmy Carter could have been first,"Why do some people have a Billy Graham-like reverence for this refugee from a peanut factory? Do these people ever listen to what this man says or are they all like rock and rap fans, jamming and rocking to crap that makes no sense and does a great deal of harm?If you truly are perceptive enough to understand the message that Jimmy Carter disseminates, you would have no problem understanding what Mr. Peanut is on the list. He could have been first. Or at least tied for first with Michael Moore."
1,What Happened to Bernie Goldberg?,"I love this guy on Real Sports, and he seems like a nice man. I'm surprised to see that he would write a book that focuses so much on the negative. And to top it off, he is so obviously slanted against anything liberal. Thats just silly.Why is everybody an extremist these days? Sorry Bernie, but you made a terrible book. Stick to your Real Sports gig. You are great at that!"
3,Entertaining book...wrong title,"John Stewart nailed it on The Daily Show...the people in this book aren't the ones responsible for screwing up America. Many of them, however, are phenomenally stupid. I found this book quite entertaining, even though I disagreed with many of his choices. Goldberg does make some valid points about Barbara Walters, Rex and Kathy Hilton, and the media coverage surrounding the Michael Jackson trial. However, to say that the parents of Paris Hilton are actually screwing up America are pretty bold words while we're deeply involved in an unwinnable war and Kenneth Lay and his cronies are still awaiting trial.The book just needs a different title...something like ""100 Stupid Americans Who Think They Are More Important Than They Really Are."""
1,A truly awful book,"I feel duped for buying this book. While I generally agree with Bernie, this book was a complete waste of time. There is nothing insightful or interesting in anything that he wrote. It's just the usual blather about ""cultural elites"" and ""liberal media bias"" and ""academic elites."" Same old tired crap. Every single thing written in this book was entirely recycled. A true waste of time and money. Don't bother."
1,Boring,"Sometimes I wonder why I force myself to read crap like this. What's really sad about this ""book"" is the author. Bernard Goldberg used to be a good journalist, but somewhere along the way he sold his soul to the devil of wingnut politics. Even more sad is that this book was even published. Yeah, I know HarperCollins is a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's NewsCorp, but this is bad even for them. If Mr. Goldberg wants to look at who's screwing up America he needs to take a cold, hard look in the mirror. Even a Conservative should be ashamed of this tripe."
5,"Hey Lefties, when you review a book it usually means you've actually read it.","To all those who are complaining that Bernie shouldn't have listed Hollywood types because they ""don't send troops to war..."" or ""don't make decisions.."", how about you actually read the book and stop posting Democrat talking points you picked up from Air America. Maybe then you may be able to actually formulate an original thought instead of depending on Al Franken to think for you. When Bernie says ""..Screwing up America.."" he means culturally as well. Now, last I checked Hollywood has a great deal to do with American culture.So put your tin foil hats back on and go back to listening to Air America before you miss next weeks talking points. Oh, and remember, without you they may lose their .005% listener share so keep tuning in!!"
1,Another Hate Book,"A friend gave me this book to read - I did, shaking my head that you can make money writing what is essentially a ""hit list."" If a child wrote this on a blog about classmates, he would be expelled. Yet this author will find his pockets lined with gold. Hate is not only in - it is profitable people."
1,Only if you are one of Goldberg's fellow conservatives,"This is one of those books written by a former journalist with only one point of view. If you are a conservative who doesn't read too much then this book may be for you. Of course, this book may not be for you because you already believe just about everything in here. I am just glad I read the book and didn't have to buy it myself."
1,The book is downright rediculous,"This list is so partisan and far from rational. If Bernard were honest, he would place himself on the list."
5,Easy to see why so many left wing democrats made the list.,"Notice so many democrats on this list? Why be surprised? I looked in the dictionary and found that ""Democrat"" comes right after demise and right before demoralize with demented not far away.Yep, it's easy to see why so many democrats are listed here."
3,A SCREWUP OF A BOOK,"SOME PARTS ARE VERY FAIR AND ACCURATE, OTHERS ARE JUST WHINING & DRIVEL.SUGGEST SOME WRITERS LOOK AT BIG ISSUES THAT WILL REALLY IMPACT MOST AMERICANS. THERE ARE ENOUGH BIG ISSUES WITH WHICHTO CONCERN OURSELVES .WORTH READING FROM COVER TO INDEX AND MAYBE A LITTLE MORE"
2,Fifteen minutes I'd like back now,"Of course, I'll never get them back.I'll quote Dorothy Parker for my review:""This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown aside with great force."""
1,What's he got against the Nobel Peace Prize?,"Maybe Goldberg is one of these scared neo-cons upset about Michael Moore and others shouting what the neo-cons think should be kept queit. But Jimmy Carter?I suppose for one who supports war (war for war's sake), as Goldberg surely must, people so accomplished at peace and negotiation are a threat. Where would we send our troops if we sent men like Jimmy Carter in their stead? Home? We know Dubya and his supporters don't want that."
1,Vapid blather designed to incite more of the same,"Mr. Goldberg suffers from the very disease he diagnoses in others. He could have written a thoughtful book with a thesis and supportive argument that furthers an intelligent debate. Instead, he feeds more empty pap to the hungry conservatives by taking cheap shots that are either dead wrong (e.g., Jimmy Carter), unfair (e.g., Paul Krugman), or just pathetic (e.g., his one-word entry for Courtney Love as a ""Ho.""). The Americans who most deserve criticism are those who send books like this to the top of the charts when there are so many well-written books from all points of view that languish in obscurity."
1,bernard goldberg and his ilk are screwing up America,"He left off a few prominent names. Bill O'Falefel, Rush Pillbaugh, the traitor Robert Novak and himself. People who are really damaging America by sowing hate and divisiveness between us."
1,The New McCarthyism,"Just what every right-winger in the country has been waiting for - a brand new Enemies List. There's nothing here but smears and slander from a disgraced ex-journalist.If you want to insult your own intelligence, go ahead. If you really need this sort of crutch, by all means, buy this book. If you dwell in the reality-based community, however, and prefer facts instead of FAUX News, then you'll want to skip it."
1,IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH? :-(,"Typical right wing propaganda from another converted pig, who attempts to lead the cattle to the slaughter for the Bush regime.George Orwell is turning over in his grave, he'd never believe this many years after 1984 that the fascist government and those liar's that support them due to personal greed or ignorance would still be getting away with such utter nonsense.All of the great americans on this list actually care more about the real people than any one the author is supporting. This trash is what's really contributing to the downfall of out beloved country. The continuous dumbing down of america continues here.GRADE F"
1,What? A right wing bias?,"Many of these other reviews hit the nail on the head. I just find it amusing that the category where it states the other authors people bought from who bought this book include both Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter. Pandering much? Is that supposed to keep America from being screwed up? Less opinion, more fact please."
3,Right wing agenda,"This is a warning to Al Franken fans: This is not a book that is pro-Al Franken.The very little bit of the book I skimmed while waiting in Target (the books are across from the cosmetics section, where my wife likes to set up shop) really convinced me that this is not a book that talks about the great things that Al Franken has written, said, or done in this world. It does NOT cover his satirical pieces that he and comedy partner Tom Davis authored in the brilliant first five years of Saturday Night Live. It does NOT applaud nor does it celebrate his liberal satirical books from the last two decades. The damn thing doesn't even mention ""Trading Places,"" or ""Another Saturday Night.""So even though the title of this book is very subtle, you should just make sure to pay close attention to the words and the order in which they come. I'm beginning to think the author thinks that Al Franken has assisted in screwing up America! Seriously, that's what I think he's saying."
5,A social commentary,"Bernard Goldberg is an Emmy Award-winning correspondent and author. In this book he identifies celebrities, journalists, radicals, and intellectuals whom he criticizes for denigrating the United States. He also examines the erosion of American culture that occurs when selfishness, cynicism, and vulgarity replace old-fashioned civility, respect, and decency. Mr. Goldberg seems right on the mark and he makes his case with quite candor. The book also does a good job of showing the cultural divide that exists at present in the U.S.A. This book does contain some strong language."
5,America needs an enema!,And we can start by flushing these 100 turds away. Great book Mr. Goldberg. I also recommend Bias by Bernard Goldberg.
1,Waste of a good tree,Why waste your time with this guy's latest tome that is an obvious cash-in project. Maybe it should be called Goldberg's Bias. The best any of us can hope for is that this book will at least be recycled into something positive and not become another book to polarize our country even more.A mind is a terrible thing to waste and so is a tree on such dreck.(I wanted to give it a half star but that is not an option here)
3,OK if he hadn't left about 30% of the list off,"He is sick of how vulgar and self-serving our society has become. OK, so he thinks Paris Hilton's parents, Jerry Springer, and the publisher of Grand Theft Auto have contributed significantly to the erosion of civilization in the US. Fine. OK, so he decries the extremes of partisan liberals. So far, so good.He includes Bill Moyers but not Karl Rove? No Rush Limbaugh? He's does admit that this is _his_ list, and not someone eles's list, but he's still blind in one eye. Except for that, and that he seems to worship every word written by Charles Krauthammer, he talks as if he'd actually vote for sanity over partisan politics. Forgive me if I have my doubts. It is not who he includes, but who he omits, that speak volumes.Too bad. I wish I could see the likes of Mark Hatfield back, but I don't think even Mr. Goldberg would try to get him elected."
2,If you want a good guide...look elsewhere,"As I've stated many times, the quality of falcon guidebooks varies immensely. What's more is that even when its from the same author it's inconsistent. Such is the case with this book. The Falcon Guide: Hiking North Carolina (also written by Randy Johnson) is a good book, yet for this book the author has done a very poor job.The route descriptions are especially lacking in details. As are the trip difficulty scales, not to mention the author completely bypasses mentioning water sources. I don't have any recommendations on general hiking guides to virginia but if the appalchian trail is your cup of tea then look no further than Exploring the Appalachian Trail: The Virginias. That series of books is far more detailed than any of the falcon guides for the area. You'll actually want to take those books to the field because they will do more than just get you to the trailhead and no more like this particular falcon guide does."
5,Very inspirational,This is another favorite which I used as background for painting and writing. It is a great companion to Romance of the Violin.
4,Sweet melancholy,"This album is filled with beautiful music, but if you're looking for the firey, glitzy Joshua Bell you might want to look elsewhere. The music is slow, quiet, and melancholy. If you're a person who ""curls up inside"" good music, you'll love this album."
3,No No No,"I don't care for this CD ... although I love Ave Maria ... it felt inappropriate for this album ... along with many other of the choices ... it could have been far better ... there are perhaps two selections which are truly truly beautiful and wonderful ... the rest ... well, just so-so ... I intend to return it ... I am relunctant to play it."
2,Disappointed,"I had heard one of the tracks on the radio, so I bought the CD. It was too high-ended, a little screechy."
1,Voice of the Violin,I was disappointed in Bell's popular music style. I love him playing Mozart with his verve and energy - as Mozart would have wanted his music played. This seemed slow and draggy.
1,Not good at all!,"When will joshua bell learn to record real repetoire, instead of these pseudo pieces transcribed for voice? First off, the pieces aren't that beautiful, and joshua bell cannot sustain any of the pieces... Just because it is a ""famous"" name does not mean it is good! Listen to james ehnes, a 100x better violinst"
5,Voice of the Violin,"This CD has brought a lot of enjoyment to me and my family. I play this for background music and never grow tired of it. It is so relaxing. And since my father was called ""the String Man"" where we live, and he hand- made violins, guitars, mandolins, banjos, and other instruments, I have been listening to violin music, and other stringed instruments, since my childhood days. This is one of my most loved CD's."
2,Disappointing,"I have read many reports of Mr. Bell and rather than criticizing would like to offer constructive comments.His technique in virtuostic music is not in doubt. In playing more melodic music the bow grip, a different bow with a slightlydifferent centre of balance, bow pressure variation, less angulation of the body ( ie in a more forward direction), and slightvariation in his left hand finger positioning would all lead to a more intimate performance of these melodic gems, in my view.Of course to alter any of these facets would require a lot of adaption, but I am certain that the performances would begreatly enhanced.I am a violinist too and like to analyse performances. Not all Strads suit a particular player too."
4,Insightful!,"David A. Aaker and Erich Joachimsthaler flex their marketing muscles in this exhaustive treatise on global brand creation. But although the authors clearly know an enormous amount about building the perfect branding campaign, their book suffers from a patina of academia that makes it read like a textbook. The book has a multitude of marketing insights to offer and it cites plenty of real-life business examples, so we at getAbstract think you'll gain much by sticking with it if you are in marketing or public relations. But the next time the authors expound on their methods for making products memorable, accessible and likeable, we hope they spare a tender thought for their own worthy book."
2,Dated teeny bopper book,"Fun photos to laugh at and wonder what we saw in him, but full of Teen Crush info-What is Shaun's favorite color? How does he sleep? boxers or briefs? (not really...)"
5,Nice for the money......,"I got this for my new grand-daughter......now 8 weeks old. Mother loved it and thought it was really nice and she said Sadie looks at it and smiles......so, I guess that would be a thumbs up from my little sweetheart!"
2,Bad sound track,Sound on this recording is very sketchy. It is an old VHS tape so it would not be the best.
4,Can't go wrong with the T-birds,"Love these guys, especially the musical interaction between Kim and Jimmie. As a gal from Texas, this is my kind of rock and roll!"
4,Hot Enough Stuff,"As with most any ""BEST OF"" or ""GREATEST HITS"" compilation, they didn't include my favorites, but it is a whole lot of good music for the money."
3,It's just okay,"In their time, I was a fan of this band.The singer, Kim Wilson, was a fine front man in a live context.However, I cannot ignore the fact that;shuffling beat + same guitar tones + similar guitar fills + Stax-sounding horns= all songs sound too similar with not enoughvariety of the dynamics."
5,Great Rock N' Roll!,"The Fabulous Thunderbirds are what real Rock n' Roll is all about! This is a really good compilation, it hits all the high spots and is a joy to listen to. The sound is very good and everything about this compilation is just great. If you love good Rock, you need this!"
4,Hot Stuff: the Greatest Hits,I'm a sign language interpreter and I'll be interpreting at a festival where the Thunderbirds will be performing. I like to get the music and lyrics ahead of time to practice. Which albums do you think have the best overall collection of songs they play the most? Thank you for your suggestions.
3,"Really three-and-a-half out of four on my scale, but...",Kim Wilson solo is even better! I saw him at ablues club by the Virginia Beach oceanfront tenyears ago. He interacted well with the crowd andslapped me five when he came into audience. But'Fabulous' Thunderbirds is a stretch. Good orbetter than Avg. would be sufficient!
4,Great Minute Repeater,"This is one of those watches that are part of the ecodrive line where the watch gets charged by ambient and sun light. I like the looks of the watch and I get a lot of compliments. the overall design is quite modern perhaps overly so for some taste. At 7 oclock you have a multifunction dial that can show a second time zone, month and year from last leap year, alarm time.At 3 oclock there is a second hand. There is a video on you tube of a commercial for this watch that shows this second hand moving in a semi sweeping movement fashion as it moves between the ticks that mark out each second but it doesn't move like that.The minute repeater sounds pretty good as it tries to mimic a mechanical chime, but I dont think there is any mistaking that the sound is electronic even to an untrained ear.I like the dual button clasp and the bracelet hasn't snagged any hairs off my arm yet.Overall I think the watch gives you a lot for the price."
5,The Very Best New-Age Album.,"Since I For The First Time, Heard About New-Age, I`ve Been Looking For Some Good Albums. Until Today I`ve Got About 60-70 CD:s AND THIS IS THE VERY BEST. Just Get It, And You`ll Understand Why."
3,Not really a needed addition,"This feels much more like a marketing opportunity than a useful add on. My daughter jsut ends up knocking off the decorations so it got no use. Even at the big discount, I was never tempted to get the other options."
5,Barbie Girls deco pack panda,"I got this on sale at a great price. It definatly served it's purpose as an MP3 player. We've sinced moved on to the Itouch, but this was great for my younger daughter."
4,Back to fundamentals,"Every once in a while you come across a book that cuts through all the verbiage and lays out the simple, solid fundamentals of a domain. This is one such book. The style is really concise and to the point. This book has helped me better understand some of the principles behind commonly used practices.For example, the chapter on queuing theory is very concise but also crystal clear, and has helped me look at Kanban under a sharper light. The chapter on the value of information and how it relates to risk taking was also an eye opener. There are many such gems here, even though the book is relatively short. Every page counts.I think it's a wonderful book for project managers and anyone who has a desire to equip themselves with some fundamentals on which to make better decisions in the complex process of product design. The book aims to help you think clearer and gives you some navigational aids to steer your teams and organisations to a successful outcome."
3,You Can't Go Home Again,"While the quality of this CD is good, the collection is not as representative of the group's work as it could have been. Maybe I was expecting too much. I attended several live performances by Asleep at the Wheel in their heyday and I wanted this collection to take me back. It didn't. Maybe their sound is just so unique live that it can't be duplicated."
1,Limited resource value,"I thought I was getting a basic dictionary and I am very disappointed to find so many basic conversational words missing. I would have preferred the grammar lessons in a grammar booklet and the dictionary stick to vocabulary and phrases. I find it way too limited and too heavy for travel, with the vocabulary far too minimal.A small pocket booklet (ie, ""Saying it in Portuguese"")would provide much more assistance. Then you could purchase a separate grammar package if you wish, such as ""Portuguese in 10 Minutes a Day"", (excellent), as well as the ""501 Portuguese Verbs"", for more extensive verb study. And for an extensive conversation practice, the Pimsleur ""Portuguese (Brazilian) I, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese"" 8 CD set (most excellent for beginners & travel). LanguageSecrets received my 5-Star rating."
2,Brazilian Portuguese Dictionary and Phrasebook,"It is OK as such books go, but is missing the pronunciation for each word although there is a pronunciation guide at the front. I bought it because of the difference between Brazilian and Portuguese pronunciation."
4,Very helpful!!!,"I have been trying to read books written in portuguese and this litle dicctionary is helping a lot, also if you are going to travel will be necessary."
3,Title mistake,"Simply to indicate a mistake about the title of one of the tunes, Disc 1 : Not "" Sierra "", but "" Ceora "", written by trumpetist Lee Morgan."
2,Title mistake,"Simply to indicate a mistake about the title of one of the tunes : That' s not "" Sierra "", but "" Ceora "", written by the trumpetist Lee Morgan."
2,Received package damaged,"I received the package, but it was damaged. The two books come in a box set, and they were packed in such a way so that they moved around in the box during the trip, and the box broke on both the top and bottom. I didn't return it because Christmas was in a few days and I had to give the gift. It was disappointing though, that the company packaging it didn't put in any paper or packing materials to prevent this."
4,Whew!!,I didn't realize that a hot shoe safe sync was necessary for using older type flash units on new DSLR camera. Glad I found this before I fried the curcuits on my Opylmpus E-620. I've used this with no problems with the flash on a bracket plugged into the safe sync on the camera hot shoe.
5,Buy it today!,"Strangely categorized by Amazon. This is the board game and not a book!Great fun! An ideal game for your fellowship, growth groups, or other church meetings."
2,Didn't get much from this book.,"This was one of these books I'd usually pick off the library shelf, glance quickly through it and put it right back. I thought there was too much fluff. What I found most annoying was that the author inserted unrelated myths or anecdotes, etc., sometimes in mid-paragraph, with seemingly no rhyme or reason, that had me searchng for the next relevant page."
2,"A Fascinating Subject, But, Finally, A Missed Opportunity","A memoir by the daughter of Irving Berlin, arguably the best of all American composers and indisputably its premiere songwriter. I read this book hoping that certain nagging mysteries would be solved, especially about Irving Berlin's compositional/creative processes. For who could but wonder how a musically ""illiterate"" man (he could neither read or write music, hadn't studied harmony, etc.) could create so many timeless masterpieces, so many miracles of musical invention? And who would better be able to answer these questions than the songwriters first born? Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the absence of any insights into these matters. Instead, Ms. Barrett deals with the mundane, the day-to-day stuff. We learn what it's like to be a rich seven year old in New York City instead of how ""How Deep Is The Ocean?"" came into the world. The book is about her, not about its title character, and that was a disappointment."
2,"Daughter, NOT Father","I bought this book on Mark Styne's recommendation. I thought it was going to be focused on Mary Ellin's father, not on Mary Ellin. Was I off base. If you are really into a boring and clumsy description of what growing up very well-off during the Great Depression was like you will enjoy this book. If you are looking for insights into the genius of Irving Berlin, forget it! I finally shut the book after reading ad infinitem about what color her bathroom was in New York or what her mother was wearing..... boring !!!!! Not recommended."
4,Goliath,"I ordered these tomato plants for my parents as they could not locate them locally. (Their local supplier lost their contract.) I ordered online on Sunday and they recd the plants on Wednesday. They were a little wilted in the box due to the warm weather at that time, but my parents planted them right away. Thanks for the fast delivery."
4,An excellent replica and great prop for photo shoots,"We received this in the mail and it is much heavier than expected. The blade is stamped with ""Made in Pakistan"" and really looks excellent. The handle of the ""gun"" part of it is fairly shoddy, but it is only $39.99 so it's actually worth the price (even with the shipping costs).If you're a Final Fantasy fan and also into collecting objects for photography or even things you might just end up hanging on the wall, this is the perfect gift for yourself. Or for the person in your life who is as much of a geek as me and my husband.And while we're not über geeky...we're up there on the Final Fantasy [..] geek ladder."
3,Could have been better,"While over all it's pretty cool. Unfortunatly when it comes to the ""gun"" part of the blade the craftsmenship gets pretty shoty. While it's only fourty dollars or so I wasn't expecting a perfect replica, but I would have gladly paid more to get something the looked nicer."
3,"acceptable replica, but not excellent","A couple of notes for those interested:-Packaged for delivery pretty well-Sword tip was partially bent; plastic protector for sword tip was broken or had been worn through-On the actual blade itself, there are a couple of noticeable impressions-I own a smaller version of this gunblade, as far as comparison to it, I think the smaller looks more realistic. The ""gun"" handle bottom piece came off when I unpackaged it. Also what is supposed to be the revolving chamber of the gun is very flat; hardly stands out for what is supposed to be the chamber."
3,Airconflicts,"If you want a simple game to unload commuting stress with, this will satisfy you. Decidedly an arcade-style game. I've employed the use of the Saitek ST290 joystick with it as key pad control of an air battle game doesn't appeal to me. Its nice that it offers levels of play so you can hone skills from novice to expert. Being an aviation individual, I cannot get my head around how to successfully fly without an altimeter! Particularly on bombing missions. Overall, its a great bargain and intense shoot-down fun for up to 2hrs. But I'm not one to spend all day with a game anyway."
1,not for old time simmers,"This game is only for arcade use. Do not purchase if you want to experience flight similar to the real planes. I feel that if you are not a flight sim person and just want a game you can shoot and shoot, then this will appeal to you. There is a segment of flight gamers that will really enjoy this type of flight game. I do not use the term flight sim because this game has none of the characteristics of a flight sim such as IL2 and Microsoft X. The graphics are good though.So for arcade like fun great, flight some no."
3,Air Conflicts,Could have been a fantastic game... only makes it to mediocre. You cannot roll all the way over... very limited altitude... also has no cockpit view still fun enough to get it 3 stars.
4,Good Arcade Action,It would have been a better game if you had free flight. No too bad for the money. Fun to play around with in free time. It did lack flying as an American.
4,air conflict,Easy game to learn and controls are simple. Very intense game that keeps you interested and you get a feeling of accomplishhment after finishing each segment.
2,not what you think it is,"limited game play. too much of the same mission over and over. don't waste your time or money on this. good graphics, no imagination."
1,Ok if you have an old system,Game will not run properly with my Thrustmaster T-Flight Hotas X joystick. According to Bold Games Tech Support They're not going to release any current patches to fix the problem. So save your money on this one.
4,Nice Casual Flying Game,"This is a nice casual flying game that you can have some fun with, and not have to be a flying specialist. My control for this was a trackball, and it worked as well as a joystick. If you want something easy to learn, and have some fun, give this one a try."
3,"No cockpit view, throttle, flaps or rudder controls","Fun to play if you can live with external views only, and the lack of controls. It's strictly an arcade-type game- definitely not a Flight-sim.Worth the $8.00 though."
1,poorly made game,poorly made game. drops levels. very inconsistent story line. graphics are fair at best. i do not advise buying this game to anyone!!
4,ERROR Can't Initialize D3D Device,"I recieved this ERROR Window.I updated WINDOWS,Updated my Graphics Driver from,,,[...]THEN,,,Click 'START>ALL PROGRAMS>Games> Right Click on Air Confliicts Secret Wars>Left Click CONFIGURE'. Lower Resolution & other graphic settings."
5,"The Best ""Matrix and Philosophy"" Book out there","This is the sixth book on the Matrix films that I have read, and by far the best. It examines the philosophical questions that the films raise intellegently and with clarity. It is also not ""preachy"" as many of the other books on the films are. As in the films, the author presents both sides of the debate, and leaves the reader to ""make up his own damn mind"". I believe that this is true to the spirit of the Wachowskis' work.An excellent and engaging read that will leave you with more substantative backing to the important questions in life."
5,A great book and a great companion to the series,"Matt Lawrence explains the movies in an interesting manner. Instead of shoving his opinion in your face, he explains many sides to the situation including counter-arguments and supporting facts. I reccomend this book for anyone who is interested in the Matrix movies and who wants to learn symbolism and philosophy behind the series."
3,A great source of debate,I really like the first matrix but it lost some of it's touch when reloaded was released. I actually googled a couple reviews about it and found a really good one based on the whole trilogy:www.associatedcontent.com/content.cfm?content_type=article&content;_type_id=3298The author really has a good honest opinion about the whole thing and writes out exactly what I was thinking but couldn't quite put my finger on how to say it.
5,A true bible!,"If you live in Colorado or plan to fish for more than a day in Colorado you must buy this book! It is really that good. Marty doesn't quite tell you what rock is holding the big one, but he can sure get you to the river and tell you what flies to try. It is an amazingly good guide book, very comprehensive and easy to read and understand.Most of my fly fishing books are on a shelf two rooms away. This one stays right here with me at my desk. It is that useful."
5,"Kindle Book Review - 5 for the book, 1 for the kindle.","I agree with the other reviewers about the info contained in this book - it'll become a go to book for anyone looking to do some serious fly fishing in Colorado. I've had this book for a few years, and decided to buy the Kindle version to see what updates the newest revision brought. The kindle version is useless. None of the hatch charts or maps are even close to eligible. Even with the kindle app on my PC and Mac, I can barely make out the hatch charts; the maps remain eligible. Buy the paperback copy; thanks amazon for making yet another kindle book completely useless. Not having a zoom function on your products is about the dumbest oversight ever."
3,Did not see the publication date,"I ordered the hard copy version, but did not notice that the publication date was 1998. I have since ordered the most recent Kindle version, and it is a wealth of information. Make sure you are getting the newest edition and you will be fine."
3,too big to cover,books seems to do a good job as an overview. colorado is too big with too many good places to fish for one book. i really like fishing smaller steams and had a hard time finding info.
4,Good but...,"I actually like this stylus, however...I purchased it hoping it would be a good match for my DS Lite. And, while it works fine with the system, be aware of a couple things.1. This stylus, when fully extended is only 3/4 inch larger than the standard DS Lite stylus. So, it's not much bigger.2. It doesn't fit correctly into the stylus holder. It will fit, sure, but it's too skinny, so it will not lock in place and will fall out.Otherwise it's a nice stylus, it feels sturdy enough, but it's just a little thin."
4,"An improvement, for the DS Phat","There aren't many accessories out there for the Phat DS, and this is definitely an improvement of the original stylus."
1,Does not fit the DS lite,I bought this based on the star rating and description.It doesn't fit the stylus holder in the DS light which renders it useless to me.If I had read the reviews more carefully I would have seen this.Stay Away if you have a DS lite.(I will never buy another product from this company again)
4,Great stylus (but only one),My only complaint about this is that I thought I was getting two from the picture! Otherwise it's a really nice stylus and fits snugly in my DS. My last stylus wouldn't stay in my DS anymore so it's nice to have a heavy duty one like this.
5,Better Than First Party Styli,"I recently lost my styli a while back, and have been searching everywhere for a DS Phat (Original Model) stylus. I stumbled across this one and figured I'd buy it since it was so cheap, and I'm glad I did.It's a lot like the extendable first party styli, only a bit heavier, and more durable. The first party stylus bended easily when extended, but I've tested these and they do not bend unless you are actually trying to bend them.These are great, and if you're looking for a stylus for the original DS, then this will last you a while."
2,Metal Retractable Stylus for Nintendo DS,"When I saw all the wonderful reviews concerning this metal retractable stylus for the DS, I said, ""Wow! I've got to get this for my friend!"" Well, I did, and he turned around and gave it back. The stylus retracts, but it doesn't lock in place. It continuously slips (retracts in) on you in the heat of a very important confrontation or record-breaking event. The stylus itself is too thin. In order to hold it properly you have to press it into your fingers. This can cause some indents into the sides of your fingers-- not too pretty. If you happen to have a strong hand, like my friend or me, your retractable stylus will not stay retracted. A child or someone who has small hands or just wants normal game play may find this stylus appealing. I'm not one of those persons. I feel very much disappointed in this product."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"This is a nice stylus, but it is still a little short and thin. It does fit in the NDS Lite slot, but very loosely. If you don't keep your unit in a case the stylus will fall out. This is very disappointing since that is one of the main selling points of this product. Nevertheless, it feels much better than the original stylus, more accurate, is nice looking, and seems well built."
5,Essential VW Book(use it and it works!),"After 6 VW's over the last 25 years, I can say this book Works. Yes, I have a few others like the Hanyes(Heinous..)book but ""mostly"" this book is spot on. I used it most on my '68 VW bus, and really learned how to keep that thing on the road. I'm about to purchase a VW Bug(as old as I can afford) so I am digging out old info. Anyone who has an old VW needs this book."
5,Glad to see this book is still around!,"I don't have a Bug anymore, but I still have this book! This book has changed my life. It has made me a more independent and confident person. I had read this book forward and backward many times. I had to get a second one because it had gotten too greasey and pages had torn away. So I got a big binder and put the next book in plastic page protectors, no more greasey pages! This book has been a great resource it taught me how to repair my bug and when I no longer had a bug I still kept this book. I used the skills I learned from this book to fix my other cars. It also gave me the confidence to do repairs my self and that carried over to other things as well. It sits proudly in my garage with my other more current books. My wife says I should throw it away..... But she just doesn't understand."
1,No Photos,"Bad book, there is not a single photo in the book, just cartoon pics. Not a technical book in any way."
5,"Good book, easy to read","Written in laymans terms, great down to earth information on how your VW works and how to keep it running. Highly reccomended."
2,book,It OK not like the original book. Not much you can say about a book. But I guess you have to write something to submit.
3,dissapointing,"To hard to read, not put together in a way as you could turn the page and get your answer."
5,This is a Must Have,If you have a vintage VW then you need this book. It does an awesome job of explaining how to do almost anything on your VW in simple esay to understand procedures. The author also explains conceptual things so that you really do understand what you are dong not just how to do it. Plus the artwork is absolutely incredible as well as extremely functional. I have worked on several VW type 1 bugs and this book taught me more than a ever expected. Just plain Awesome and worth every penny.
4,The VW Beetle repair manual for beginners- with diagrams.,"This book has found worldwide acceptance by Volkswagen owners around the world. Its the only book I have found written, for someone who doesn't know anything about the Car they are driving. Its also called the VW owners ""BIBLE""... and most wouldn't be without their copy. Its usually found under the bonnet or rear seat of Most Beetles. The illustrations are funny, clever and instructive, all at the same time....This book has saved many a holiday or trip by a Beetle owner.Most of the time a beetle breaks down, it is a simple thing, and can usually be fixed on the side of the road. You will need some tools- and Mr Muir will tell You what tools to buy, and show You what they look like... If You ONLY buy ONE Book for Your Volkswagen and You have never pulled one apart before...Then - this IS the book for You.Lee Noonan"
5,A benchmark in technical writing,"My father's motto regarding do-it-yourself repairs was ""anything you can do, someone else can do better."" I heard that refrain hundreds of times when I was a kid and a teenage, trying to learn how things work and how to fix them when they break. Reading this book and ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"" were breakthrough moments in my life. I owe a good bit of my life and career to John Muir. Learning that I could disassemble a complicated (at the time, for me) engine and return it to its proper place in working order opened up a world of technology to me and I have never looked back to this book with anything but affection.I no longer own a VW (after 20 years of several bugs and vans), but I still love this book. I can't recommend it highly enough."
5,Great book. I can't say enough good things about it.,"I purchased one of the original editions of this book way back in the early 70's. Having never done anything more to a car then change the oil, I pulled the engine in my bug and put in a new clutch. By myself. In one day. I cannot say enough good things about this book.Later I pulled the engine in my 67 van and completely overhauled it."
3,More entertaining than informative,"This is a fun, highly entertaining book but not very informative. While there's some good information, there are also a lot of gaps. If you really want to work on your VW yourself, get the Bentley Book."
5,Second copy,"Just purchased my second copy. Besides being informative, and the classic VW bible, it's also more entertaining then a lot of fiction."
5,How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive 19 Ed: A Manual of Step-by-Step Procedures for the Compleat Idiot,This is an excellant manual for maintaining a classic Volkswagen Beetle. I got my origional in the mid 70's and it saved me many times and a lot of money. The updated version has even more material.
4,Helpful book to manage brand differentiation problems,"In a era where most of the brand managers have been taught of simple methods of brand positioning and urged to be single minded, this book provides a new comprehensive way to find richness in the brand image planning. The author does agree in a need to find a position in order to guide the communication efforts, however it provides a whole new frame to consider the brand strategy through different angles, most of wich have not been well explained or sufficiently developed in conventional marketing textbooks or marketing bestsellers."
4,An Excellent Read,"Building Strong Brands realizes right away how crucial a brand identity is in today's economy. Well written and researched, Aaker delves into case histories of some very well known brands--such as Saturn--to forcefully argue his premise about the vital importance that a well-established brand identity can play in marketing and selling a product. Although his case histories are strong ones, each situation is unique. Guerilla PR: Wired is laden with various techniques to help an organization market its brand identity."
5,one of the best books ever about the sales process,This book is right on the mark for all types of selling. Very professionally done and the technique is just what is needed in today's markets. All my reps are advised to read and use the work book. It is our primary training aid for all registered reps.
5,Give people what that WANT then they will sell themselves!,If your sick and tired of being sick and tired being rejected over and over again then maybe your trying to sell thru telling and persuading. SPIN SELLING lets the client see what their needs are through their eyes. This book will turn your prospects around especially on major accounts one hundred and eighty degrees!
4,S.P.I.N. Succeeds,"It's good, but I liked Levine's Guerila PR: Wired better. Liked the jokes and stuff."
4,Good Experience,This product was used for a company selling training session. It arrived on time and had some great content to it. Everyone seemed to find the value of the book to be relevant and interesting.
5,A No Fluff Workbook to Improve Your Powers of Persuasion,"A very clear book applying SPIN Selling techniques. No fluff, no extraneous threads leading you away from the primary focus. The techniques can be applied far beyond sales, and utilized in a broader sense to persuade as opposed to the narrower definition of selling."
5,Good service and good book,"The ""used"" book was is great shape and delivered quickly. The book is a good addition to other books and CDs for learning Portuguese."
2,Too Clinical,I bought this book because my physician that is treating my headaches/migraines had recommended that I start taking 5-HTP on a daily basis. I wanted to learn more about 5-HTP. But this book is way too clinical for the average Joe. It really hasn't helped in educating me on 5-HTP at all.
2,sent the wrong part,"I ordered this part from AutoPartsWAY and they sent me the wrong part. I wanted 'ReadyLift 66-2515 Leveling Kit with Track Bar Bracket for F350/F450 4WD' they sent me a part for a toyota, not an f350. When I contacted them, I got an auto form with a return label, but no personal communication and it was not clear whether I had the option to replace the wrong part for the correct part (which is what I wanted). I did eventually get my money back, but was still out a few weeks of waiting (since I was still hoping to get the correct part and did not know that I was going to have my money refunded isntead) and had to order the correct part from someone else."
3,"Okay, I have to admit it...","I bought this CD for only one song... Duran Duran's ""Sunrise - remix"", the first new track from the original ""Fab Five"" in almost 20 years. That alone is worth having the disc. And yes, the TV show is hilarious too! So go get a patch of ""Sunrise"" and play it back to back with Sting's remix of ""Send Your Love""..."
2,Great shirt - wrong size,"My husband is a huge Captain America fan so I was thrilled when I found this shirt and got in time for Christmas. He's a big guy so I ordered an X-Large and that IS the size on the tag, but this shirt is not an extra large by any stretch of the imagination. My husband had to give it to our 11 year old son. He is the smallest kid in his 6th grade class and it fits him perfectly. And now we've heard that Captain America is dead. Will the disappointments ever end?"
2,BUYER BEWARE,"Description says ""Men's"" t-shirt but the XL fits snuggly on my petite wife. This seems like kids sizes. I doubt the largest size offered will fit an average sized man."
3,Great Item,"I am enjoying the tee shirt very much. My grand son, who is three, wants to have one like the one I have."
1,Dumbfounded,She can't sing. And this is an easy song to sing. Must be a vanity project. Extra points were deducted because she attempts to scat midway.
3,Take this with a grain of salt,The item description says that places like Japan that have diets high in omega 3's have the lowest rates of depression. It is a fact that Japan has one of the highest suicide rates in the world. Do happy people really commit suicide that often?
3,Good source of information,"Stoll needs an editor--much of the material is repeated one or more times and often cut-and-paste is in evidence. There is much tangential information that won't be of interest to everyone in order to pad it into a full-length book. Still, it is a good source of information regarding sources of omega-3 oils and how much to take."
4,Best discovery for everyone,"This is one of those books where after you read it your life style will change. We spend billions of dollars on health care at the treatment level when we should be focusing on the cause.As a physician treating cardiovascular disease the cause is in our diet. Read it if you want to know more about yourself and lead a healthy life.[...]This is an excellent book on the omega-3s, which are health providing substances found in fish oil. Either way, this is an excellent book for learning more about omega-3s."
3,Dry read,"I did not complete this book. I had expected a faster paced book but instead, this book was very detailed and did not keep my attention."
2,Where are the millionaires?,The book contains a lot of anecdotal information but it is rarely followed up with any conclusion. There are a lot of interesting facts but very little follow-up. It primarily reports on the art and riches that disappeared into the Third Reich to never be found again.
2,Poorly written and Redundant,"I had high hopes for this book, but found it tiresome. Stolen Nazi millions should be an interesting subject, but this books takes all the life out of the subject. The cast of characters is large, and if you are not familiar with the inner workings of the Nazi regime, keeping them straight is difficult, and this book does not help. The stories are largely redundant, Nazi's steal money, and try to hide it at the end of the war. More often then not, it goes missing. After the 8 or 9th tellings, there is little for the authors to add to the basic plot. Couple the redundancy with poor writing, and I'm afraid a good subject is still in search of a good book."
1,anticlimactic,"I knew when I ordered this book that it was a form of history/documentary, but the authors were very tedious and repetitious and were unable to add much imagination to the writing style, making it pretty much dry and boring. I was especially disappointed that they did not go beyond Germany and follow the trails of those Nazi's that are widely known to have fled to Argentina and other South American countries. That would be interesting to learn more about how they continued their lives on the lamb."
1,nazi millionaries: the allied search,I have read many books about Nazi thefts. This is one of the most boring book on this subject I have read. I would give it a no star if possible.
2,Yawn...what a shocker...not,"I was given this book as a gift, and I can only hope that my friend did not pay full price.Having read through it, let me convey the overriding sarcastic thought that kept racing through my mind: oh gee, what a surprise. Just think about it...the Nazis, who murdered millions of innocents, had the audacity to steal millions as well...shocking.I cannot remember a less revealing book connected to WWII. The bio stuff has some interesting bits, but the main theme lacks drama and contributes absoltuely nothing to our knowledge of the period.In my opinion, the 2 star rating is being kind."
4,Started out Quite Well... but I lost interest after a time....,"I have to admit that I was excited about reading this book, and it was quite interesting for a while. But then I found myself skipping whole sections of it and about half way through it, I stopped reading it, as it began to bore me a little bit. I might take up the rest of the book up at some future date, but as of right now I'd call the book just pretty good. Maybe it becomes more interesting again towards the end? Thats why I'd like to finish it at some point later. It does have lots of interesting detail...(almost too much though), certainly a ton of different Third Reich leaders & personalities are examined as to their possible role in obtaining Nazi riches. Some of them were pretty bizarre characters, and I guess thats what kept me reading for quite a while."
3,Very...informative,Very interesting and extremely informative. Exposes information I can't even believe is true. But it repeated a lot and read mostly like a textbook with personal noted thrown in. I could have done with an abridged version.
3,A remarkable look at the plunder of Europe under Nazi rule,This book provides details of what happened to some of the stolen wealth taken from Jews and the wealthy during WW2 by the Nazi Party. The network is drawn showing exactly how this was done and who the key participants were. Some even escaped justice with their stolen loot. An eye opening history of greed and plunder on a massive scale.
3,"ineteresting topic, but rough.","This is a fascinating topic, but it has been written for readers who are already savvy with WWII history. I was constantly looking events and characters up in attempt to keep abreast of the sporradic subject changes. A timeline would have been useful and helpful, as I found myself creating one while reading the book, as an attempt to organize the mindboggling pace the characters were introduced. Small supliferous details seemed to distract me instead of enhance the facts. Nazi Millionaires is written with a very pronounced bias, which also seemed distracting. There was very little detail given about the loot, which was dissapointing. Perhaps the title should be changed to reflect the process of thievery and the extent the Nazis took to conceal the treasure? Perhaps 3 stars is generous because I do not intend on finishing the book, but I might keep it around to skim."
1,a misrepresentation of Lama Ole and his wishes,"This man is misrepresenting Lama Ole and his work. He does not have all the qualifications he says he has, or permission from Ole to be associating Lama Ole's name with his work in the way he has. I find his website to be very self aggrandizing, and suspicious. Diamond Way buddhism in no way endorses his work or has any association to the teacher Rama whom this author praises. I mean this man no harm, but I am disturbed by this kind of incorrect information circulating on the web."
4,great value,"this is a good alternative from the canon cartidges bec of the price. canon cartidges usually cost about $15 per cartridge, and theres 5 for a canon mp630 multifunction printer. also, it says thats no chip in the name and description, but it actually came with all the chips, so i didnt have to save the old ones for the chip.one major flaw i had, and idk if its with everyone, but i was short of the small black cartridge, and had an extra magenta. another small flaw is that the life of the cartridges. its ok for the occassional prints, but not for constant printing tho. the cyan and yellow run out pretty fast"
5,Great update,"iPhoto 5 is a great update. It does lots more, and on a dual processor G5 really flies! It does have a bit of a funky response if you tweak the saturation of a photo in extreme highlights (window in a backlit situation) where the whole area of complete white goes a funky color. But just undo what you by reverting to the original and start over. iMove and iDVD are good updates too with the new 16:9 ratio and some really nice themes. Better performance, and more functionality. Garageband with recording up to 8 lines in at once is a major improvment, especially being albe to see notes appear as you write your music! It may not be Logic Express (also owned by Apple) but it really works well. Garageband alone is worth the upgrade.And if you're an education professional, there is a great price break!"
2,Too simple,The price is excellent. The content is of high school level. It lacks detail information. I'd still prefer my far older National Geographic Atlas of the World.
1,very displeased,"This atlas is not organized so that it is user friendly. It is impossible to find a city in a partucular state, it is done by country areas. (north east,etc)"
4,Nice and affordable,"This Atlas , as every book , has pro's and con'sPro - Nice material , very affordable , easy to read , and to find places and features.It comes with some (form me) useless sattelite photos , where beauty is the main concern. The one thing I liked is that the maps are not cluttered with hundreds of names . There is a new edition every year , whitch I find is the great thing about this Atlas - The Political World is updated on a annual basis .Con -It is not , and it does not pretend to be a reference book. It is not for professionals of any area who need an extremely delailed atlas . It is not for schollars , researchers , history and geography buffs .When it comes to a very complete work , I would recommend , The Time Atlas , Comprehensive edition , whitch in my opinion , is the Gold Standard ."
4,A clear and comprehensive atlas.,The main virtue of the Oxford Atlas of the World is its clarity. It may not be as detailed as the larger and more expensive competitors (eg National Geographic Atlas of the World) but the maps as plentiful and very readable.
5,Share the World with Your Whole Family!,"The Oxford Atlas of the World is the most beautiful, comprehensive, practical and up-to-date version I have found. My husband bought it for me for Christmas, and we also purchased a copy for my son and his family. It is difficult to keep up with locations of new states, and newly-named states in today's fast-changing world. Now when I hear the name of a country or area that I know little or nothing about, I can enjoy referring to the atlas not only for its location but historical, geographic and political background."
5,Successful experience!,Very good quality of service! The product arrived fast and in excelent condition! Congratulations for your excelent service!
3,U S States,"Oxford Atlas of the World, 14th Edition. I had hoped for more towns listed on U S States, otherwise Atlas is very useful for other areas of world."
1,World Atlas,"This appears to be a quality publication but I find the type a little harder to read than others I have seen. It's a nice size, but towns are not as easy to find as other, larger maps. I have not yet had reason to use the printed information in the front and the back."
1,Shame to Oxford for poor quality control --or worse...,"I just bought the Oxford Atlas for a Valentine's present for my wife, and I just want to react to at least two parts of the book in which the cutting of the pages (with about 3 pages in each case) was defective and the extra width hidden by folding of the pages. I just didn't want to go through the trouble and cost of sending it back to Amazon in exchange for a new one, but I was extremely angry and disappointed. It is not only poor quality control for what is supposed to be a high quality book (and Press), but a obviously a deliberate attempt (and a successful one) to sell it anyway. This is, of course, Oxford University Press's fault, and Amazon has nothing to do with it."
3,good enough for the price,"it arrived in good time. it is an excellent atlas. it is just what i was looking for, however, the wall map was missing and the dust cover was beyond repair. upon further examination i found that there was a nasty gash in the front cover."
5,Unlimited Geography,This product hides its outstanding value in an innocuous title. This is far more than just an Atlas! The collection of information is truly astounding. Add to that the sattelite views of differing earth locations and the comprehensive maps and political history and you have an encyclopedia of the world second to none!
5,One of the best atlases,"This is one of the best atlases - and a newly added country profiles section and foreign goegraphical terms glossary make this book even more useful. The atlas is well designed and beautiful. However, I recommend this atlas be bought together with the Hammond World Atlas, another excellent atlas, because of different place names,thematic information,statistical data,etc."
5,Wonderful,"The last good atlas I bought was a Readers Digest atlas in 1963. I loved it! The maps were excellent and the index was good. I've looked for newer atlases since then, but never found any I like. I prefer basic atlases with good maps! The Oxford Atlas of the World is just as good as my old favorite one. The maps are supurb and it has an extensive index. That's all I ask for in an atlas, but it also has other features. It doesn't have extensive US maps but I didn't need that as I have a very good road atlas of US. If you just want to look up places this one is excellent."
4,"Very good, but be careful with the spine!","This Atlas was hands down the best I have owned. The geographic statistics about income, population, life expectancy etc. are very informative and helpful. Measurements mainly given in Metric, very helpful for us Canadians =). Be really careful about abusing the atlas though, the spine is fairly flimsy and will break if you drop it."
5,Outstanding Reference,I purchased this book for my husband. He is always wanting to know where a country is he hears about on the news. This has been an excellent reference for him. Not only countries but a lot of other information as well.
4,Atlas for the Kids,"This book is huge, which the kids loved. The maps are nice, and there are lots of facts. The only thing bad I would say is I thought there was going to be more real pictures of earth."
2,Trite,I was disappointed with this book. I've been impressed with the author's other works. But this one is very dated.
1,"Hardly ""The Best Of"" Christian Death","Cleopatra has once again released a mediochre collection of songs written by Rozz Williams. The original tracks are timeless and brilliant (as always), but Spahn Ranch has completely destroyed one of the most touching pieces of music ever written (Cervix Couch), and The Mission UK's minimal industrial/techno treatment of Spiritual Cramp just sounds silly. Laibach's reworking of The Angels is one of the few mixes that actually works, giving the song a middle eastern feel while keeping the integrity of the original. Bottom line: after helping, along with Valor, to drive Rozz insane and ultimately to his early grave, they are continuing to use his name (and genius) to line their pockets with below average releases."
2,Cleopatra records will do anything to make a buck.,"You don't put remixes on a ""best of"" compilation. You just don't. Plus, you don't put songs that don't belong on a ""best of"" compilation on a ""best of"" compilation. Whoever threw this thing together was blatantly and insipidly trying to make money off of Rozz's tragic suicide.Yes, I understand that the troglodyte known as Valor holds rights to ""Ashes"" and ""Catastrophe Ballet,"" which is EXACTLY why this CD should never have been produced. Without songs from those two albums, you can't have a best of Christian Death. It just isn't possible.Rozz Williams was a genius. Skip this crap and buy the actual albums - in particular, ""Catastrophe Ballet,"" ""Ashes,"" and ""Only Theatre of Pain"" - you won't be disappointed, as almost every song is good."
4,Great album but lacking some songs...,"Much material from "" Ashes "", "" Catastrophe Ballet "" are not here, more from "" Path of Sorrows ' could have been included...and one of my FAVORITE Rozz Williams songs "" Spectre "" is absent! but otherwise a good start for someone not familar with Williams. But please don't limit your exploration of this artistto JUST Christian Death. Reccomended!Kaenan James"
1,Don't Judge A Book By It's Cover,"CAUTION: This book may fool you. I have one word for it: *hisssssssssssss*. It looks like a nice Wiccan book BUT IT""S NOT. Witches, beware! It is for biased Christians so they can just convert people who believe in an earthbound religion with a goddess. Listen. Trying to covert someone is bad. Not everyone can believe the same thing as you. Wiccans have not been harming Christians, so who gave Christians the right to convert Wiccans? Wiccans don't believe in Satan! Satan was invented by the Christians. Satan is not real! Don't accuse peace-loving people of believing in him."
1,"If you don't think too hard, or you already agree with her, this book is for you.","Nearly any Pagan who reads her words carefully will find themselves agreeing with the first half of each sentence, then saying ""huh?"" to the second half.The best thing I can say for her is that she is quite adept at blending truth and fiction. The result, of course, is utter nonsense, but if you're a Christian looking to confirm what you already believe, I'm sure you'll find this book to be great. Otherwise, its a waste of time. Just to point out one little flaw you can read for yourself in the excerpt - she interviews someone who no longer considers themselves to be Wiccan. Would a Christian feel their beliefs could be accurately represented by someone who claimed to have left the faith? Of course not. The resulting book is nothing short of ridiculous."
1,Covert Christian Garbage,"I looked through this book in a local store as it innocently sat among the New Age books. I must warn every person looking to escape the Christian grasp that this book was written by one of them - a Christian spy in the Pagan ranks. How dare the author point at another religion and its ""faults""? Wicca doesn't claim to have all the answers and it doesn't need to - that's the definition of ""Faith"".Now, two can play at this (fairly give and fairly take) - Have a look at ""The Encyclopedia of Biblical Errancy"" by C. Dennis McKinsey and the collected works of Joseph McCabe and Joseph Wheless to see what refuse Christians are protecting.Christianity is a monster in its death cycle - trying desperately to cling to a life it doesn't deserve.Again, to all Pagans everywhere - avoid this book!"
5,Top Drawer,"Anyone who is knowing the state of Marketing at present realizes just how very, very difficult it is to be reaching one's customers and overcoming the fissiparous tendencies rending the marketplace today. Schmitt's lovely book is a must for anyone who is wishing to prepone their Marketing plans and to be taking their customers' emotional reactions into account. To the person who asks ""the book offers many concrete suggestions, isn't it?"" I can most certainly intimate ""Yes, many, many."" Overall, a very good book, and I am recommending that you should be ordering it."
3,Experiential Marketing,The book arived well at my home without any problem. The delivery delayed I belive because I don't live in a big city of Brazil.I read good part of the book and it's amazing!! Some upgrade is needed when its talk about tecnology because the book is a little old.
3,Tools for a better marketing,"The next step, from traditional marketing is undoubtly , the search to provide good customer's experiences.The book provides some ideas to manage a framework for the customer experiences , in which the author considers 5 steps : sense , feel , think, act and relate.The most integrated experience that we can provide to the customer , will bring the most ""holistic"" perception and as such , the best market results.It is important to design strategically the experiences , but also build a experience oriented organization."
4,Canon Speedlite 220EX,Product was as advertised. Delivery on time and well packaged - OK.But I decided I needed a second and stronger flash and purchased the Canon 430EX locally. I now find that I tend to always use the Canon 430EX and seldom use the 220 EX.
5,Perfect portable speedlite,"I purchased this speedlite for my Canon G-10. It is the perfect companion to the build in flash. It is small, lightweight, easy to stow & carry. It certainly enhances G-10's photos and syncs perfectly with the camer. I would highly recomment it!"
5,great flash,I loved this flash. I think it might fall short for the pros but I am not a pro. If you want more flash then the one that comes on the camers this does a great job.
5,Canon Flash,It pays to buy Canon accessories for Canon Cameras. Everything is automatic and functions well
1,WEAK,"I bought this tiny flash for my digital Rebel XT. Mistake. A few test shots in the dark indicated that the Rebel's pop up flash was more powerful than the 220. I called Canon customer service to ask about this and was told that yes, in fact the pop up flash IS more powerful than the 220. Stay away from this flash. If you can't afford a bigger, better one, than you'll have to do without while you save up your money."
2,Would be better with the ability to bounce flash and more power,"This is a basic flash that makes all the decisions for you-it's auto only. However, the fixed flash head does not allow bounce flash which to me is a deal breaker. Indoor shots can be so beautiful and evenly lit with bounce flash, but this unit is just a better version of what's built in to the Rebel or G series, complete with harsh lighting and blown out detail. It's too bad Canon feels this is a good entry level flash-Nikon has the very basic SB-400 for a similar price, but has bounce ability and is much more powerful than a built in speedlight."
1,Why does Canon keep selling this subpar product?,"I ordered this flash as a replacement for a 420ex (that I was borrowing from a good colleague). The minute I opened I had the ominous feeling that it was going to be a disappointment. Indeed! The very first test shots were incredibly telling as to how lousy and shoddy this flash is. First, it does not swivel so you can kiss your hopes for bounce flash goodbye. Second, it's lacks punch and power. In many of the informal tests I performed, the built-in flash of my camera (and even that of a point-and-shoot I have lying around the studio) is more powerful!!!!!! I re-packed it and sent it back. Got a 430ex and am nothing but satisfied. In short, stay away from this flash! In this case you won't even get what you paid for--avoid!"
3,Speedlite 220EX review,"The unit works well, and works well on a shoe. The range is very limited though, especially when shooting indoor sporting events. I should have gone with the bigger flash."
3,Canon Speedlite not so speedy,"Bought this flash for my Canon digital rebel xt. Had the same results asthe built in flash, so I returned it. May work better with a differentcamera."
4,Goes great with the G,"I took lots of photos with the flash. All my photos came out great as long as the flash was seated properly. The only complaint/dislike I have is the mounting, I wish it mounted more stable. The lock switch is not enough to hold it in place, it mounts loosely and has came off my camera several times. Before each shot, I must make sure it is seated properly and fully or the flash will not work. -1 star for the mounting."
3,Canon Speedlite 220EX,"Generally satisfactory, for the price. Does not rotate or tilt, preventing relfected light photography. Allows TTL phoyography, which is an advantage."
3,They did better than this.,"This is'nt really an album thats really great, its more of a an album with a handful really good songs.""Animal"" ""Rearview Mirror"" ""Daughter"" ""Small Town"" ""indifference"" an underated song, some of Pearl Jams most outstanding music.The rest of the album is pretty raw and unfocussed - not that thats bad, if you like that sort of thing.But its a record that is defintitley Pearl jams most rawest and in your face."
5,ANOTHER TIMELESS CLASSIC,"I BOUGHT THIS ONE AS SOON AS IT CAME OUT IN '93!! I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I HEARD ""GO""..I HAD 2 6X9 SPEAKERS IN THE BACK OF MY CAR..I BLEW THEM BOTH TO HELL..LOL!! I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE COOLEST ROCK SONG EVER. I MEAN IT JUST ROCKED YOU!! BUT ANYWAY..THIS FOLLOW-UP TO ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME(TEN) IS AMAZING. SONGS LIKE ""GO, ANIMAL, REARVIEW MIRROR, DAUGHTER, GLORIED G., DISSIDENT AND INDIFFERENCE(THIS IS THE ""RELEASE ME"" OF VS.)ARE TIMELESS!! MY PERSON 3 FAVORITES ARE 1-""INDIFFERENCE""(LIKE ""RELEASE ME""..THIS SONG IS HAUNTING AND BEAUTIFULLY SUNG BY VEDDER. 2-""GO""(READ ABOVE) AND FINALLY ""REARVIEW MIRROR""(THIS ONE HELPED ME THRU SOME TOUGH TIMES IN MY LIFE AND HELPED ME MAKE DECISIONS I NEEDED HELP MAKING!! ""SAW THINGS SO MUCH CLEARER""!! *****"
4,Great!,"I am often disappointed when I see an album filled with ratings of 5 stars, I don't think people seem to realize what that means. You gotta save the 5th star for those extra special, classic albums. This is an outstanding album, however (probably one of my top ten albums ever), even if I don't give it 5 stars. Why someone would insult Pearl Jam by comparing them to Godsmack is beyond me. Pearl Jam's talent far exceeds Godsmack. This is definitely a cd worth owning. Even though I feel every song on this cd is great, I could see how some people would not like some of the non-radio friendly songs like wma, blood, etc. All that rage filled into one album, and then a song like indifference thrown in there at the end! It's great!!!"
4,A Good Follow-up To Ten...But Not Great,"Vs has some good and some bad to it, but well worth it if you are a Pearl Jam fan."
4,"Good but, can be loud.","Pearl Jam's follow up to there classic debut 'Ten', The cd, 'VS', is louder, but still a good follow up.The songs, 'Daughter', and 'Eldery woman behind a counter, in a small town', are classics.Thease songs are more angry and agressive. Songs like 'WMA','Leash', 'Rats', are angrier than songs on 'Ten'.The song 'Blood',is a screaming loud mess. that i do not like.In general 'VS', is louder then 'Ten'. However I still like it."
5,PEARL JAM second MASTERPIECE!!!!,"After a HUGE INCREDIBLE MASTERPIECE like TEN, PEARL JAM did it again...the songs from Vs may not be ABSURD classics like ALIVE, EVEN FLOW or JEREMY...but for me, this one, VS is on the same level of TEN...All the songs are really great...from the heavy punk of GO, REARVIEWMIRROR, ANIMAL and BLOOD...to the acoustics of DAUGHTER and ELDERLY WOMAN...WOW!!!!This is a tremendous classic!!!!one of the best albuns of all time, without any doubt!!!!BRAVO, PEARL JAM!!!This one and TEN are INCREDIBLE!!!"
4,"4,5 stars Amazing album",THis album is one of their best (Well not like Ten but close enough).Its a good place to start also if you are new to Pearl Jam. Its a very good album for relaxing and i prefer listening this album in my car when i travel. If you like grunge music then this is amust album that i highly recommend. Very good work.
4,Not their most creative wok,"Pearl Jam's 'VS', their second album, is a pretty good successor to 'Ten'. However, it's neither as good as 'Ten' nor as artistic as 'Vitalogy'.It's still a four star album though."
5,"Not as groundbreaking as ""Ten"", but...","I think the world was pretty much awestruck by the originality of ""Ten"", and this album is a prime follow-up. Very political in nature and emotionally charged in every aspect. I don't perceive Pearl Jam as being the best musicians around, but their lyrics and melodies just hit home. This album is definitely no exception and will pave Pearl Jam's road to a very secure place in revolutionary rock history. If you don't own this piece, I easily recommend it alongside ""Ten""."
4,What can I say? Back to you....,"An album of which much credit is due. This album has one of the best songs ever written: ""rearviewmirror"". It beats out any rock song by far, and I don't see much others that could come close either. Vs. is a great album, although a little stereotypical sometimes (Animal, although good, is sort of monotonous). Still a strong album. Good job, PJ."
4,A solid alternative rock album,"Vs. may not be on the same level as Ten, but it's still a strong album in its own right. It's an eclectic album, adding groovy and folksy elements to its hard rock base. Some strong points include the phenomenal ""Dissident"" (the best song on the album), ""Daughter"", and ""Glorified G."" The album has a few weaker points, especially ""Blood"", but on the whole it is a good album with some great moments."
3,Not their best.,"Vs is a very raw and messy album, back when Pearl Jam were noisy and screamed alot and had alot of long hair.Of course their are some very very good tracks on here that deserve a standing ovation.""animal"" ""Daughter"" ""Blood"" ""Indifference"" and ""Rearview Mirror"".The rest are just very, well certainly not bad, but to unfoccussed and undeveloped."
1,Terrible...,"Didn't like it. If you only like/know them from Mtv/radio play, I think your'e better off grabbing the Rearview Mirror comp. I hear alot of people call this their favorite so I tried it for cheap. I still like the hits, so I might pick up Rearview myself."
1,"Have you no shame, Mr. Vedder?","I'll admit it, back in the early days, I was a real big fan of Peal Jam. They rocked, and , more importantly, they stood up for those less fortunate than middle America. Than I head the song 'Daughter' and I learned that Eddie didn't have sympathy for at least one disadvantaged group in America: The mentally handicapped. On that track he cruelly and heartlessly mocks the vocal affectations of those with mental disabilities, just to get a cheap laugh. I'll admit it, his impression is dead on: he totally sounds like a 'tard. But is it really appropriate to mock the mentally handicapped, particularly when one is involved in so many fashionable, liberal causes? Well, no. The time for fratboy humor is over, Mr. Vedder."
3,That's funny....,"Yellow Ledbetter was a bside for the Ten album. Which is the only PJ album I own. Before they started on the journey towards boredom with this OK album, with a couple of terrrible songs. Hmmm.. For such a passionate review, you really should know what your talking about."
2,Hoped for better,"Used to have cd, lost it, and wanted it. If i had've known about the scratches on the the disc and that it didn't even lock in properly inside the cover i would've chosen a different avenue. Plastic wrapping was also tamperred with. Pissed off and not yet listened to it as, by the scratches, don't want even more disappointment!"
5,great album!,This is a quintessential alt rock album of the 90s! Great tracks that illuminate Pearl jams appeal and talent. I couldn't have gotten thru the 90s music scene without it!
5,Theres a reason it sold nearly a million in its first week,"Its because Vedder and company made one of the best follow-up albums in the history of rock n' roll. Just LISTEN to ""elderly woman behind the counter"" a truly awesome all acoustic jam with Vedder proclaiming ""hearts and thoughts they fade...fade away"" as the song comes to a close, truly awe-inspiring."
4,Great Follow Up for one of the Decade's Best,"This follow up to ""TEN"" is really impressive, as not only does it manage to be a better album than it's predacessor, but it explores music sounds and genres and furthers Pearl Jam's resume of what they are capable of. We see a more country side to some of the song, as well as acoustic elements, and yet the album still rocks as much as ""TEN"" did.Grade: A-"
5,better than ten,"This album is better than their first and has just as many ""hits"" if you know what i mean. It is one of those albums that does not have a bad song on it. Though it lacks the glossy production of ten it is heavier (in a more organic kind of way). If you don't own it there's a gaping hole in your record collection."
5,Grunger,When I listen to ten i don't think of it as a grunge album just a strait out rock album a very cool one. This is there first grunge album and it is great IMO there is more memorable songs on it like daughter distant and reviewmirrior that have a more grand sound then say black or even flow. You also have rockes animal leach go which are all good this is a great album that in may ways is better then Ten I have yet to hear the new one but what I have herd it my beat there first two.
3,Just slightly off,"Vs. is a good album...nothing compared to Ten or Yield, but good none the less. However, there are a couple tracks that just seem to be fillers - ie, Glorified G, Blood and Rats. C'mon, where's the substance? The rest of the album is very solid, deep and great to listen to. Especially like Daughter, Dissident and Elderly..."
5,Best album ever,"If you liked Ten but thought it could be a bit heavier you'll love this. This is the strongest album by them, the only this closer is the latest self titled album. It starts strong with 'go' and even in the middle of the album when they start to experiment with 'w.m.a' you're still totally sucked in. A lot of rock albums tend to have song after song that sounds the same but each song here has it's own feel, no two are similar at all. This album also has perhaps their best song ever 'rearviewmirror', raw emotion and loud guitars dominate this album and anyone who wants to know what the 90's grunge was all about has to check out this."
4,Great Sophmore Effort,"This album caught a lot of flack and a lot of people didn't like it. I am not one of those people, I really liked this album. Trying to follow up ""Ten"" (one of the greatest rock albums ever) is a difficult thing to do and soph. albums more often then not end up sucking. Vs is solid Pearl Jam that any fan will love. Will also be enjoyed by fans of 90s rock."
4,My favorite Pearl Jam disc,"Recorded without the studio polish of ""Ten"", but without the muddy sound of most of the later albums, ""Vs"" has great songs and performances. All of the songs on the disc are good, each hit different moods. The lyrics are excellent and the guitars are strong. Definitely ""grunge"" near its best."
4,Rocks - Fantastic - Proper Music ......But......,"This CD is good, very good.But some of the songs could of been a bit more straight forward like the songs of Vitolagy, as it would of been an easier listen all the way through."
5,Pearl Jam - Vs.,"""Saw things so much clearer...""In ""Rearviewmirror"", Eddie Vedder foreshadows this album's effect on rock in the 90s. Vs. mainiuplates harsh lyrics and an aggressive sonic landscape into an easily understandable form. Whether it's the driving percussion of the leadoff track ""Go"" or the acoustic mayhem of ""Elderly Woman..."", this record illuminates what rock has been trying to say for years.Philosophy aside, this album kills. Each track is memorable and different from those around it. Pearl Jam could have made another Ten, but they took the road less traveled. From Vitalogy to Binaural, it is evident that this record truly defined the band's sound. Immaculate."
5,Blistering!!,"From the walloping opener ""GO"", this baby rocks plain and simple. Eddie Vedder and Co. sound absolutely possessed on this sophomore outing. The production on ""VS"" is crystal clear, the song selections are inspired, the sequencing is perfectly balanced and it runs just over 46 minutes, so you won't tire of it before the final song ""Indifference"" plays out. The overall sound of ""5 against 1"" is pretty eclectic. From acoustic balladry (""Daughter""; great lyrics), relentless thrash (the terrifying ""Blood""), playful rockers (""Glorified G""), moody soundscapes (""WMA"",""Indifference"") and just plain good rock'n'roll (""Animal"", ""Rearview Mirror""& the bluesy ""Dissident"") there's not a bad song in the bunch. ""TEN"" may have had bigger hits and made them the darlings of the MTV crowd, but this LP firmly established them as a legitimate 'band' that planned on hanging in for the long haul. A Classic Album."
4,Remember grunge?,"This is Pearl Jam's best album. There isn't a bad track on it. Every song is either a noisy rocker (Blood, Go, Leash), a passionate ballad (Elderly Woman, Daughter), or something fun and a little weird (Rats, WMA). It includes Rearviewmirror, which is probably the ultimate Pearl Jam song --- Eddie Vedder sings like a wounded animal, the band is locked together in the same groove, and the music just builds and builds until it almost breaks. If you don't own any albums by Pearl Jam, buy this one anyway."
5,This is an awesome CD,"This is just an amazing CD. It's great cause instead of being just hardcore grunge, it's a bit evolved. Don't get me wrong, I love the grunge, but it's good when bands take a chance and change. This cd has a lot of really good songs, but I do have to agree with the guy who said it earlier, I think songs like Go, Blood, and Rats were just fillers. I mean they're ok, but they're not as good as they could be. Animal was a rocker all the way through, Daughter and Elderly showed their more acoustical side, and W.M.A. was a cool change, I really liked the all the drumming and guitars, it's really good stuff. But, my favorite on the CD is by far Rearviewmirror. That's just an amazing song. I can't say any better cause I can't think of any other way to describe it. One more thing, it's pretty hard for a lot of bands to have a second album and have it be cool. But, they pulled it off nicely."
4,Before the downfall,"This is still the good Pearl Jam, the band you can relate to, the album that has songs that stick in your head without having to be another 'Alive' or 'Jeremy' that made 'Ten' a success..lyrically a bit more politic, but at the same time a bit more uplifting and even humouristic concepts compared to 'Ten' which was serious all the way. More melodies also, and songs that are a bit more happy and joyful, and also more acoustic songs, which is great. 'Daughter' is an acoustic-driven song, and it was a big hit, a very good song simply...'Dissident' a very melodic riff and some overall nice singing...'Leash' is a great anthem youth song which is refreshing from PJ, and so is the bittersweet 'Glorified G' which talks about gun control with tongue-in-cheek lyrics, this is a song that wouldn't have fitted on 'Ten'...the rest is also good, like 'Animal' a pretty aggressive song that's one of the highlights on here...GREAT!"
5,each song has something new...all different,Go- 10/10 great openeranimal-9.5/10daughter-9.5/10 overrated...glorified G-9.7/10 almost perfectdissident- perfectwma- i luv the meaning behind the song 10/10blood-whenever im angry this is the song 11/10rvm-perfect 4 driving 11/10rats-odd but good 9.8/10small town-i like the solo better but this is ok 9/10indifference- best song on the cd alot like release another good end to a great cdbuy this cd...no regrets...im suprised its not priced higher
4,Straight ahead rock that they called grunge,"If you are new to the band Pearl jam, get this album. If you have another album and liked it, get this album. If you hear them on the radio and you don't like them, get it anyways. This album covers the entire spectrum. Both Stone Gossard and Eddie are at there best on this album. The rockers on this album, ""Don't go"" ""animal"" and ""blood"" are among the band's best and hardest. The ballad's aren't the best, except for ""Elderly woman..."" and of course ""daughter"" but the album doesn't suffer because of this. My personal favorites on this album are ""rearviewmirror"", ""blood,"" and ""glorified G"""
4,Glorified version,"This release isn't on par with ""ten"" to me, but it still ranks pretty high. It's hard-hitting rock with equally impacting lyrics. ""Vs"" marked the end of my tight squeeze on Pearl Jam, and as such, for me is the last of their real rock sound."
2,Only for the most dedicated fans of the series.,"Fans who have read the entire series of Doctor WhoNew Adventures may find this book more rewarding,but for those who haven't followed the entire runwill find this book too convoluted with appearances of characters from the previous 49novels of the series. Adding to the plethora ofcharacters is a plot which lacks any real driveand reading like a Saturday morning cartoon version of the classic science-fiction televisionseries."
5,Could'nt be more pleased,"I could'nt be more happier with this Mini Cooper. I bought it for my daughters B-Day. She has been wanting the (REAL THING) for quite some time. Hopefully one day she will be driving one. But for now she enjoys admiring her replica on her desk at work, THANK YOU AMAZON!!!!"
1,mini me,"It looks exactly like the picture. And maybe I should have read the dimensions more clearly as I did not realise that it would be so small. I think it is big enough to fit a basketball and a tiny child could crawl into it. But there was no educational value. However, my little girl does love it and uses it as a ""bedroom"" for her dolls."
5,perfection,"I hadnt really been a huge fan of this band until this cd, i thought the other albums were good but nothing really mind blowing. i bought this cd just to say i have it and i am still shocked. this is an absolute perfect cd, there isnt anything negative i can say about it. warrels vocals r passionate and moving, he and matt barlow from iced earth are two of the better singers i know of. the guitars r played perfectly, and the drums are really inspired. i cant wait till the new cd comes out, i wonder if they can top this effort. my personal fave on here is the title track, it reminds me of type o negative. its really dark and has some great backing vocals. poison godmachine is also a fave. really and truly i love all the songs, this is one of those cds u play without skipping a single song."
5,Absolutley tremendous,"This album is truely amazing and every song is special, no filler material here, just pure emotion and excellence in musicianship.I saw Nevermore late last year when they toured and I was interested to see if they could transform their intensity, emotion and heaviness into a live setting. God did they ever, the music was terrific, Warrel's voice was tremendous and the musicanship on stage was phenomenal, the tracks off Dreaming Neon Black were standouts. Warrel and the boys also interacted very well with the crowd whilst showing alot of respect to the crowd in appreciation of their support. Its a shame only a few hundred people showed up to support the band, im sure if alot more people would open their minds and give this album a try, and the other releases by Nevermore, Nevermore would harness all the respect and attention that the media and mainstream society give to much more mediocre and brainless bands."
5,"...And laughing, planned the end.","Century Media has another winner here. I never heard of these guys, then all of a sudden my friends wouldn't stop raving about them. After hearing this album I know why. Warrel has a passionate delivery of his equally passionate lyrics. I highly recomend checking them out, and if you ever get a chance to see them live, take it they put on a hell of a show, and just as all musicans should be, these guys treat thier fans great, I hung out with these guys after a show in CT and compared notes with the bass player. Check this cd out, you will not regret it."
4,This is what a Metal Soundgarden Sounds Like (4.5 Stars),"I can't figure it out but the musical atmosphere this band gives off in their albums so much remind of a Metal version of Soundgarden, without the grunge. Both had a dark gloomy feel about them. Excellent underrated band. Dark atmospheric metal, with clean vocals and extended destoration. Alot of galloping chops but beautiful harmonic dark guiter undertones. The title song is the Superior song here with acoustics followed by slow power chords (was that a gothic Lita Ford on the female vocals?), but many gems are here. Tight clean production and the instruments are all clear here. Their new album comes out July 29 and I can't wait. This is the place to start with their music, I did and have been a fan since."
5,Power Soaked Brillance,"This is one hell of a CD. The two things that stike me are the cohesion, power and intensity of the band and the drumming. The CD is a roller coaster of intricate melancholy moments to intense power metal expertly produced by the great Neil Kernon."
2,Crap,"Look, I don't get what the hype about this album is. Nevermore can obviously play, as demonstrated by the first song on here. But why did they choose to have the whole album be a mid-paced, boring almost-concept album?I bought this album because ""Deconstrution"" was freaking awesome, but I was quickly disappointed when I discovered that it was probably the heaviest song on the album.Half the songs on here are so slow they're practically ballads, and ""The Lotus Eaters"" is one of the most irritating metal songs I've heard. I buy an album for great guitars and headbanging, not to listen to the most pathetic, whiny ""Please God..."" a guy can muster over and over again.Not the worst I've heard, but this really bores. I simply refuse to buy or listen to any Nevermore albums after this piece of crap."
4,A Band to be Respected,"Only 4 stars....I would love to give it 5.they have earned 5 . but no 5. I cannot with good faith give that last stars due to the final mix . Every song on here stands tall for it's content. The pain in the lyrics is evident , the passion of the music intoxicating.The muddy mixture of some songs...unforgivable.Overall a wonderfully written work of modern metal that will ALWAY be on my mp3 player as all their other albums are.I am a fan."
5,Anything Nevermore is doomed to be perfect....,"...and this is no exception. The album is supposedly a concept album but not in the traditional sense of a story. Instead the songs all have the same thematics based on the loss of a loved one and are said to be Warrel Dane's interpretations of various dreams he had. On to the music part now, Dreaming Neon Black is everything the Nevermore fan expects. Crashing guitars, solid rhythm section and amazing vocals by Warrel. These guys know how to write good music regardless of people calling them power metal or death metal or anything. This is good music nonethless and Dreaming Neon Black is one of the best metal albums out there. Don't hesitate to give it a listen."
2,Not Without Some Help,"This video too is mostly hands pointing at a project on a table. Contrary to the claims that it is teaching you to sew, the video only shows their chosen type of top and collar. There are few sewing or construction demonstrations. The narrator refers to the different stages shown but unless you are familiar with top construction, you're going to need a reference book or the help of an experienced sewer. The portion on fitting and pattern alteration was informative but again a beginner might need more explanation. It's as if someone is reading from a book while you look at the pictures. And this might be due to the age of the video but some of the sewing techniques can be done in less time and trouble with the use of sewing tools, such as a button placement guide, found at your local sewing or craft store. Again, this video is under produced and well over priced."
5,Outstanding musical dvd!,"Love it, Pedro Fernandez at his best. Good choice of songs, his ""charro"" attire excellent, and his form perfect. Bravo!!"
3,The old and rare becoming mundane.,"Not a very exciting disc to listen to. Sounds very primitive as you might expect due to the content. I can see why they had not released this for years and years. It is one of those things where when you are an extreme fan you just have to have it. But after you get it and listen to it once, your bubble is burst and you realize it was not all that great and it would not matter if you ever listened to it again. Some good moments and nice to hear how these songs became great after some growth of the band and better production. In all I think it's mysteriousness and the fact that it was not available for so long added to the hype but once you get it you realize it was never that big of a deal to begin with."
1,Wow! What a Pile of @#$%!,"Reviewed for Big Boss Games by: JRRWith the wealth of budget titles being released, you have to wonder if they are worth the usual $20 price tag. Sadly, with this game, a $10 price tag wouldn't help.Trigger Man comes to all platforms, and suffers the same fate equally well.Your a mob hitman, and the gang wars are about to begin. Sounds cool, right? In concept it is. But poor ""execution"" in all departments ""kills"" any chance of fun. I couldn't resist.Playstation 1 graphics, mixed with sub-par controls, ridiculous character animation and poor level design plague the entire game. No voice samples at all, period. Yup, you'll be reading the whole comedy, er, I mean story.Basically, a really low budget wanna-be Hitman knock-off, on it's best day. Gettin' rubbed out, would be more worth your time.To sum it up, ""It's curtains for this game, see!"""
5,Impressed,I'm extremely impressed with this dock/kit. I wasn't sure what to expect but Belkin did a great job. I dock an XPRESS RC & an XPRESS EZ and they both work great. The remote is very functional. I have this hooked up to an external antenna (Terk XM6) and couldn't be happier.
5,Outstanding,"I am an avid reader of many different types of books and this is without a doubt the best seires I hav ever read. Iris Johansen is one of the most talented writers I have had the pleasure of reading. She keeps you so enthralled in the story that you feel like your living it rather then just reading it. I'm not sure which was my favorite, they were all first rate. If I had to choose then it would be this one. If you have the opportuinity to read this book.....DO IT! You will never forget it!"
2,"Disappointed, I normally love Iris Johansen's work","I normally love Iris Johansen's books...The series on Eve was excellent. I just couldn't make myself like this story. It didn't seem to match the description when I started reading it. Normally I will push through a book with a slow start or perhaps material that doesn't immediately appeal to me, but I just couldn't keep on reading this one."
4,Great book,It is great to be able to read some of the background regarding where the Wind Dancer came from and the history regarding it. This book definitely stands on its own (not necessary to have read any of Iras Johanson's previous work) but you can bet you're going to want to buy the trilogy!
2,"Sex, Death, and Destruction","I had just finished a gloom and doom book, and was looking forward to reading something uplifting. This was not the book I was looking for.If you are looking for a light read, don't read this one. It was a tradgedy."
5,A trilogy of four,"Albeit IJ wrote a trilogy for the Wind Dancer at least is another book with the same theme, ""Final Target"". So at least this is a fourth-logy.As it says in the back cover the plot'll do twist after twist in an excellent pace so you won't know how the book'll end. The statue's story is kind of a second plot among the other stories because you really don't care what happened to it for example in the malady or in everything Lorenzo does. Mind that I didn't say that the statue is not important in the plot's book."
3,a letdown....,"After reading ""The Wind Dancer""..I cant understand how it has received such rave reviews..this book held little appeal for me..I struggled to finish this story..However, I will admit that I really enjoyed Lorenzo... but I hated the way things turned out with Caterina!!! Anyways, not terrible, but not great either..I dont think Id buy another book by Iris Johansen."
3,It's O.K.,"If you have to choose between this book and ""The Colors of Nature: Subtropical Gardens""....I suggest his other book ""The Colors of Nature: Subtropical Gardens"" it's much better in my opinion."
2,It's a landscape picture book,"While I was interested in seeing the presented works, I was disappointed that the landscaping drawings were mostly only a half page and had no detail information as to the plantings, etc. Basically it becomes a picture book to examine the presented landscapes, some of which I have seen repeated elsewhere. The overall size of the book is too small to get much value out of the photographs of the landscape that are presented. The plants seem to mostly exotic that would not be available to most people."
3,horse review,"the 3 dimensional horses were freezes (i.e., only 1 side of the animal was there) rather than full 3 dimensional items, but otherwise it was quite nice. They were easy to paint and everything came with the item."
2,horse cast,The horse legs seem to be thinner then the horse body so when casting is taken out of mold they break. Tried 3 times & each with same result of broken leg & too thin for me to glue back on. A great idea though. Also bought whale kit which worked out well.
4,Great toy,I bought this for my step daughter and she loves it. This is great to keep her busy and she can make gifts for others with this too. :)
4,a thrill to read,"This book had a profound effect on my life as most of potok's work does,,All of his books have changed my outlook on life and one has actually made me consider the distinct possibility of converting to Orthodox Judaism in a year or so,,Thanks Potok.."
2,not very good,"This is not a very useful product, but if you absolutely need it I would recomend you buy it. If you don't need it don't buy it. Well that's all i have to say."
4,HIKINg the PCT,"Very good story of hiking the total PCT from start to finish. The trials, tribulations, and wonder moments all detailed. Loved the parts where other hikers became part of the experience as well as the lone parts. Felt like I had done it myself, and the disappointment of the end."
4,An entertaining read,"An entertaining thru hiking book. Although the author is more of a loner then other thru hiking authors, he more then makes up for the lack of interesting people that you meet on the trail usually. Great descriptions of the journey and humorous moments along the way. I really enjoyed his writing style."
5,I love this book!,This book rekindled my love of backpacking. It motivated me to purchase new bacpacking equipment and hit the trails again. I love George's sense of humor; I had several laugh out loud moments while readig this book. George is the kind of guy you want to sit down and have a beer with while allowing him to entertain you. I first read the book when it was available for free online. Since then I have purchased the book and read it several times. Every time I loan this book to a friend I tell them they have to be sure and give it back once they've read it.
3,Long on Kiwi humor; short on backpacking narrative and photos,"This book was an easy read, but disappointing in its lack of photos and descriptions of life on the trail and destinations seen."
3,A bit disappointing,"Although I commend the author for his courage and humor, some things about the book distracted from reading pleasure. This read like a self-published book (maybe it is) that had not been edited at all. There were no paragraph indents, and many sentences were run-on (strung together with commas when there sould have been a period). I'm not a stickler about grammar, but this was distracting and made it hard to read. There was also a problem with tense and scenes suddenly switching. For example, in a camping scene, the author would suddenly mention that he saw 3 bears while camping, but it turned out that this was referring to something that would happen several chapters later, so that during the present scene I would wonder, ""Where are the bears?"" Often I would hope for an interesting scene only to be disappointed by a blow by blow of each day and night on the trail (including the days where nothing really happened). If you can deal with the amateur style, you may enjoy this book."
5,Best PCT Book I've Read,"Read this story several times before it was available in book form and was thrilled to find it had been published. I've read dozens of books and journals on hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, and Dances With Marmots is by far the best!Spearing's gift for description and humor make this a fun read. The author has a gift for putting the reader on the trail beside him and his anecdotes of trail buddies, town stops, and dealing with customs at both ends of the trail are a delight.Dances With Marmots makes you want to strap on a pack and hit the trail. A must for anyone who loves the outdoors and needs a chuckle.Blessings,Perry P. PerkinsAuthor""Just Past Oysterville"""
2,Good while it works.,"We bought this phone retail, it worked for 1 year. Then the answering machine completely stopped working. What a waste of money and plastic/materials, talk about making e-waste.The machine loses the time when the power goes out. You may thing this is no big deal but when my rice cooker can save the time, this is no longer acceptable in today's world.The password system for remote access is 3 digits, barely acceptable. The sound quality and speaker phone is decent."
3,Atmospheric and mystical literary read about Bs As,"A short but intriguing novel set in 2001 from Eloy Martínez, a writer whose work battles between history and literature. Whereas 'Santa Evita' (****) and The 'Perón Novel' (****) saw history dominant, here it is the literary side that provides an (allegorical?) framework for an almost mystical search through the horrors of Argentina's recent history. Best read if you have a knowledge of Buenos Aires and Borges - and a map handy!."
5,40mm pink crystal prisms,this is a gift for my sister the crystal prisms are wonderful crafted i have been thinking about ordering a couple more for myself
5,Nice,"The item arrived as described. The quality looks to be good, No issues/complaints at all! Happy with the purchase. Thanks"
3,good. but not as pictured.,this was good quality and very pretty but not at all the color pictured. it was a very bright dark magenta. i still like it and hung it in the window but it wasn't what i wanted and i think because the darkness it doesn't really make any rainbows like the light ones i have.
4,Pretty crystal... nice decoration,"I bought several of these to hang along my office window to catch the morning light. I have had them up for 10 days now. These are a nice size, heavy, well cut, about as big as a golf ball and the color is not too watery... it looks very nice in the sunshine.They look so pretty and sparkly hanging there, pink and shiny and beautiful, but for the most part these balls fail at sending out the prism rainbows onto my walls like I wanted and expected them to. The few sparkles I get are very small and not very bright. I have tried them at different levels on the window and at different times of day without any different results, so I have just decided to hang them there as a beautiful decoration and love them as light 'catchers' instead of light 'diffusers'....I did not receive any little crystals attached to mine, so it must be different sellers send different versions of this crystal. Mine came in a sealed, small, white box with about 2 feet of thin red cord."
4,Shalamar Anthology,"This is a great compilation.The group went through a few membership and image changes and this compilation does a great job in including all the music with both original and new members.Their music reflected a time when R&B harbored a strong feel good vibe.A few things happen for me when I pop in the cd.I either want to go out and party or get in the car and drive as fast as lawfully possible (Dancin in the Sheets)A lot of parties were anchored by these songs.I hope that this compilation is enjoyed by many.and where are they now?The originals that is.Howard,Jody(Fine,Fine Fine and Jeffrey."
3,Maybe good for outdoor!,For me the backgammon should be a board so when you roll the dice you hear the fascinating sound! I bought this for school so I did not care that much and most of the students did not know what it was. I guess for tournaments it is good as it is cheap but I won't buy it for my home!
1,Case does not fit treo 650,"The case that was sent was marked as though it should be for the treo 650, but did not fit.... sent it back."
3,Great price...you get what you pay for,"I was so excited to find these items for my Treo 650 at such a low price. However, the ear bud does not give clear reception for the listener at either end. The phone cover fits too tight and presses the buttons on the phone. This is still a good price even if you only use the car charger."
4,Excellent,"This is a challenging study but worth every moment. The depth of this study is typical of Beth Moore and her thoroughness. It is excellent and I recommend it highly. There is also another series, not by Beth Moore but really wonderful. They are videos called Know Him Through Hymn. Beautiful messages and the DVD's all have music in addition to the bible study, which is unusual. It's great to have so many resources available to Christian women!"
3,Disappointed,I expected to have more of an input on leading this bible study with the help of this book..not much help at all.
5,Daniel - Bible study by Beth Moore,"This is an excellent Bible study. Beth Moore brings all the lessons in Daniel into our daily lives with humor, passion, and knowledge. I fully recommend it for anyone interested in relating Daniel to today."
5,DANIEL LEADERS,RECEIVED THIS IN GREAT SHAPE AND ENJOY IT. KNOW THAT IT WILL HELP ME IN LEADING OTHERS. RECEIVED ON TIME
3,Love Beth Moore,"Love Beth Moore . Also purchased the Bible Study booklet that accompanies the booklet and was hoping for a more in-depth study, would be more satisfied with a book than a study. But will continue to purchase her products."
3,George Carlin:It's Bad For Ya,"George Carlin was a funny guy,an atheist and wrong sure,but funny. Most atheists or ""Humanists"" or whatever you want to call them or in Carlin's Case a Lapsed Catholic are usually dry and not funny,Never wanting to accept anything but ""facts"" or science.Ironically despite his annoying views he was actually funny in regards to other matters and Ironically conservative about trends and other things.(Ironically Moral??)I really like the Heaven looking down upon us part and The Tiger Woods rant."
1,A Bad Last Performance -,"This performance is boring, even aggravating. It's just not funny, and is way to full of the ""F"" word. Carlin was much funnier previously, especially on TV and the Carson show."
1,Carlin's Swan Song,"George Carlin has done it again. A concert intended for laughs but ends up going much deeper. He easily attacks our beliefs and values, destroying them. Same wonderful Carlin, funny but thought provoking. Obviously much more than a comedian. He knows all the stuff we have had jammed down our throats by parents and religion and appropriately educates us all with simple logic. Who else could make one not believe in God or government? Makes a lot of sense to those willing to think and question why we are in this state. George Carlin, before his death, implored people to ask why they should believe in something with no proof. He will make you re-evaluate all that you believe in. A must see for eveyone out there. There is something that relates to us all."
2,Not his best,"I'm a George Carlin fan, but I have to say I was disappointed with this show. Instead of his usual sharp wit and cutting humor, this one just felt... bitter. I suppose maybe he was beginning to feel his own mortality, or maybe that razor-sharp mind was beginning to slip a bit. In any case, just felt like there was a lot of plain old meanness and contempt in this performance that overwhelmed the humor. Certainly it had its moments, but this will not stand out as one of Carlin's best performances."
5,One of Carlin's Best Specials,"It's funny and critical just as much as his last 3 specials before this one. It also a little bit sad to have a lot of the material on this be about death being that he died a few months after filming.Oh well Carling, yoou are deeply missed and just like you said: ""There is no... UP THERE!"""
5,One of his best - RIP George,One of his best performances yet. He crosses the line and takes the audience with him.
5,George I love him!,how can you NOT love George Carlin. he makes you see things just a little bit differently. It s hard to believe that he's gone.
2,He was better than this,"I am definitely a George Carlin fan and have been for decades, but this performance is a sad end to a brilliant career. In fact, I think the last couple-few HBO specials he did showed that his performances were becoming much less the brilliantly astute observational comedy used as a tool to break down absurd social constructs and instead seemed to just feature him becoming plain mean and self-righteous. The expression ""crotchety old man"" comes to mind. I dearly love the bulk of his work and will miss his insightful voice, but it's sad to me that he ended on this note."
2,Waste of money,"I am a lifelong fan of Carlin's, going back to attending the infamous standup in Milwaukee in the 70's when he was arrested. This DVD was a big disappointment. It's a mean spirited harangue on kids and a second rate rehash of his opinions on religion and some politics, which he has already done, and much funnier. Rent it if you must, but don't waste money buying it. It gets a little better in the last 15 minutes, then it's over. Bah."
1,I AM NOT A FAN OF THIS PRODUCT!,"This flash was purchased to go with the T1-i by Canon thinking that this high quality flash would sync well with the Canon camera. Here is the major issue: The flash is weighted significantly ahead of the important engagement point of the camera to allow for proper syncing. This engagement is crucial because it ensures the ETTL mode is firing for digital instead of TTL for film. However, because of the design, even when the flash is screwed into the camera, I feel that the forward weighting of the flash is always wanting to slightly disengage this area (even when screwed in), not allowing for proper communication between camera and flash. The flash works occasionally and inconsistently. Frequent sendbacks to Canon! Who knows, maybe I just got a lemon. Do not recommend. Tech support tend to be nice people though."
5,Great For Dental Photography,"I take pictures for an orthodontists, and this has drastically improved the lighting on my photos. Its great for close up pictures. I use this in conjunction with a Cannon Rebel XT and a 60mm lens."
4,Won't fit directly to Canon 100mm 2.8 L,"Great product, BUT against as stated in product description, it won't fit directly to new Canon 100mm 2.8 L macro lens, and adapter from 58 to 67mm is required.I received both, Canon 100mm 2.8 L and this lens, just to see that spend US$38 more is require, and worst, need another week to start using those products.."
4,intraoral pics,"It's really good. I'm a little confused though on how to use it since I used another friend's camera before and he had everything set up w AV n just changes the numbers. I'm kinda ignorant on setting up cameras but the pics I took using AV w ettl mode on flash settings were good but I get a lot of black pics. Again, it's me not reading the catalogue"
5,Awesome for intraoral shots,I use this for taking photographs of my orthodontist patients. I have it mounted to my 100mm macro lens. Perfect.
3,works ok but the build feels off,"its a good unit but the price is a bit rough to swallow (even though its fair)my unit seems to work well 95% of the time but the other 5% it either fails to fire or its exposure drifts.the build feels weak specifically the cord.a note before you order this unit, it requires an adapter ring to mount to your lens so make sure you get the right 1"
2,Just Another Collection Of Re-Records...Yuk!,"Note: This was originally for the review for the actual music Cd release in 1999 and not the mp3 version Amazon.com released in 2010. The Amazon collection has 18 tracks, the 1999 Cd had 10 but both have and use redo's and seem to not be the original tunes. A number of the Amazon release tracks seem pretty good indeed. At the current price, the Amazon collection appears to be 'not a horrible value'. Listen to the previews then decide to buy or not. End-----On the back of music CD case, in small print you will find the kiss of death statement:These tracks have been re-records by the artists or one or more members of the original group.K-Tel Entertainment UK, put this stuff together. Simply, not even close to the original stuff we all know so well. Don't waste your money here.Packaging is pretty nice but this isn't recommended."
4,Just a little biased,"'Jankiewicz"" well that is Polish. I guess I am a little biased but we have a composer who is Polish, a pianist who is Polish and a listener who is Polish. OOps I forgot the cellist. Not Polish but definately good. I have Mr. Axe's perfomances of the Chopin piano concerti with period ensemble and that lead me to these recordings. Not period ensemble but a pleasure to listen to none-the-less. Now we know Ma can play baroque cello so what could he do here?"
2,THE BLOODFIST MOVIES WERE UNRELATED AFTER THIS; 2.5 STARS,"THIS TIME AROUND, JAKE RAE [DON ''THE DRAGON'' WILSON] GIVES UP HIS WORLD TITLE AFTER KILLING AN OPPONENT IN THE RING. BUT, THAT'S NOT THE LAST TIME HE'LL BE COMPETING. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, HE'S CAPTURED AND ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER MARTIAL ARTS CHAMPIONS, HE'S BOUGHT TO AN ISLAND FORTRESS TO TAKE ON SOME DRUGGED-UP FIGHTERS. NOT AS GOOD AS ITS PREDECESSOR. WHAT SAVES IT IS THE VERY GOOD FIGHT SEQUENCES THAT OCCUR NEAR THE END. THE STORYLINE FOR THIS MOVIE SEEMS TO BE VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF ''ENTER THE DRAGON''. BUT MOST MARTIAL ARTS FANS WILL LIKE IT ANYWAY."
3,"And the winner is... Don ""the dragon"" Wilson","Bloodfist 2 was a pretty good low budget sequel. The plot was a little shaky but the martial arts was pretty good. Art Camacho provided the action sequences on most of Don's films which were most behalf on the mediocre side. The good thing about the films is the martial art champions that were brought. There were shoot fighting champions, tae kwon do, hapkido, judo, and shotokan. The last fight scenes in the ring were pretty good. Don Wilson displaying some great continueous single kicks. Overall a average martial arts film with some good fight sequences."
4,Excellent Beethoven's 5th...,"I purchased this after hearing it used as an example or comparison on a classical music radio station. They compared this CD's version of Beethoven's 5th Symphony to the previous ""gold standard"" and it was clear how more energetic and probably true to Beethoven's vision of it this one is. I love listening to it. Beethoven's Symphony No. 5, or at least its opening, is arguably the best known classical music in the general public and a cliche, but like beautiful sunsets, none of that detracts from it's beauty, and it's popular for good reasons. The other composition, zeroPoints, is certainly unusual if not strange and may take some getting used to. It is not melodic but it does grow on one and is interesting. It's not what I listen to when I want to relax and just enjoy the beauty and energy of good music, but I do listen to it occasionally for musical interest. The CD was worth it for the Beethoven piece alone, zeroPoints is (to me) an interesting side dish."
1,Lost!,"Despite all its tall claims (and the reviews posted by others), this book is not enjoyable because it addresses nobody except its own mind that seems to derive pleasure from hurling all kinds of (mostly bad) ideas here & there, mostly in a language that suits American teen-agers more than others. Most of the ""discourses"" were skewed, fantastic, ribald in a ghastly way, and totally bereft of any redeeming value (like humour and compassion) that enlivens works by Mike Resnick. Don't go for this volume, there are other, far more scholarly or entertaining or valuable-on-both-counts books that are preferably over this wastage of paper & money."
4,A thoughtful & delightful book; well-written & reverent,"We rent this from the library every year and hope to find a copy of our own. The stories are short, well-written and easy to relate to despite the very different lives these children lead. Exposes kids to other cultures & traditions w/o the gratuitous politically-correct overtones and stereotypes that ruin so many holiday books.Another great Hanukkah book for the 6-10 age group: The Trees of the Dancing Goats by Patricia Polacco. A warm story of neighborly concern that leads to deeper understanding & subtly highlights the common underlying theme of the 2 December holidays. Also not a 'formula' story."
2,The book and its concepts REALLY need to be updated - better suited for expecting parents,"I honestly wish I had perused this book in a store before buying it online. Its ideas are applicable in the 80s (maybe early 90s), but not in today's culture or technological climate. An expecting parent may appreciate the nursery ideas, but I was very disappointed by the ideas for older children (those that are out of cribs).I think we could all come up with the idea of painting a funky pattern on a dresser on our own - if you're looking for real ideas or inspiration, this is not the book. Sorry."
1,I guess I should not have expected much but the copyright date on the book was 1997. VERY OLD AND OUTDATED.,I flipped through it and tossed it in the trash.I didn;t expect brand new but was not expecting a 16 year book for decorating ideas!
2,Cute but not made very well.,I thought this was cute and would be functional for my son to use at daycare. I knew it was going to be thin but the bottom is made poorly as well. I was not happy that the pillow part is not machine washable; it is spot clean only. I thought for the price I was getting a decent deal with a character my son likes. Most places that sell sleep mats are much higher but now I wish I would have paid the extra money to have something made better.
1,NOT SO GOOD,Product has no expiration date listed on packaging. Wish I would have opened them within the 30 day return period. They tasted like they could have been years old.
3,"feels cheap, but it works",1 You get what you pay for. It looks and feels cheap2 The connector pin (one that connects palm tx) is not a perfect fit. If you don't insert it carefully it might actually damage your palm tx charging port3 Bottom line. It works and given the car charger from palm (and other manufacturers) is ridiculously expensive this is a decent buy for any one on a budget
1,Does not work,"I ordered this product from the company provided at Amazon, however it wasnt even worth getting it cheaper... the charger is loose on the cigarrette lighter, the LED light doesnt turn on and have yet to receive a response to my emails sent to the company that I bought it from. Needless to say I am return the item today so that I may receive my refund back."
3,producto basico pero interesante,el producto cumple con las espectativas. es comodo y pequeño. carga la palm en un par de horas.excelente ecuacion precio-producto. recomendado
3,Embossing ShapeBoss Winter Wonderland,Long time since I bought this & have used once. Not my fav embossing. I now prefer embossing folders over this type.
2,not worth my money,"i can work with flat iron but i shouldn't have to work that hard. it leaves line prints in my hair, it takes all the shine away that i've dded with my shine product, it's heavy, it's handle is too fat, the curved plates (which causes the lines) served me no purpose because i can achieve this for lift by combing my hair at a 180 degree angle. the dry look it gives is the worst for me. just bought a conair ceramic iron ($17 bucks) that left unbelievable shine with smal amount of product. i mainly need this tool to give my hair a bob- like curve and for lift and it gave that but with dry look."
2,whre is the music,to much noice and no music .. if you put this noice publically -they will not like it
5,I've fallen into the slippery zone and I can't get out!,"I was channel surfing in the car the other day and heard Ickes playing a bluegrass version of Herbie Hancock's ""Watermelon Man"" on NPR. I nearly cried - it was Dang Good! This bluegrass/jazz/fusion thing rocks!"
3,Now for something completely different,"Not bluegrass, not jazz, not pop..but fun and nice to have. If Ickes would refrain from singing, it would be even better."
4,Many truths in very few pages,"As the daughter of a minister (my mom is a Southern Baptist children's minister, and I often felt I got the short side of the stick - she was available to all of God's children, it seemed, but not her own as I was growing up and the members of the congregation pushed her well beyond her job description) I very much related to much of what Yancey said in this short but valuable little work.He walks the fine line he is so adept at walking - he does not sugarcoat but at the same time he does not rob the church for what it is: the Bride of Christ, rightly understood, though made up of fallible and fallen people who should absolutely continue on, together, down the roads of life in community.Read it for yourself and see what I mean, for it is a quick but inspiring read that will reaffirm your faith even if you didn't know you particularly needed the boost."
2,Not what church is about,"Yancey fills a necessary niche with those who have had experience with church which causes them to fall away and then fill a void that needs filling. However, his bottom line perspective of worship being God has an audience watching worshippers seeking His presence in their hearts is not what God seeks at all. God seeks those who worship Him in spirit and in truth. Thus, where is God in worship? In our heart? What would He want with that sin-filled, darkened, old thing? What He wants is ""chesed,"" Hebrew word for ""covenant faithfulness."" Our inability totally to do ""chesed"" caused God to do it for us, incarnate, sacramentally in Christ. Thus, where is God for us? In the Gospel preached in its purity and distributed in the sacraments distributed according to His Testament. Yancey is yet to discover this. Maybe his void will lead him to this. Suggest Yancey and others still seeking God would read Gene Vieth's terrific spiritual journey: ""The Spirituality of the Cross."""
4,Book Club Book,I read it for my church book club and found it interesting and gave me great ideas of what I did NOT want my church to be like. It was an eye opener
5,Excellent quality,"I own both this 46"" set and the previous version of the 40"" lCD set. Both products came from Amazon and the deliveries from Eagle transport went smoothly. More importantly, the quality of these Televisions is very good.I have absolutely no complaints."
5,Sweet,"After looking at and researching many TVs, we decided on this one and have not been disappointed in anyway. It looks nice, has an array of settings and delivers a great picture."
5,GREAT TV!!!,Really enjoying hi-def on this tv. Listed at 720p but has 1080 imputs and and I didn't really see any difference watching blu ray dvd at store compared with the picture on this Sony. Much brighter than DLP and of course much wider viewing angle. None of the glare of plasma. Only negative is possibly some of the non hi def shows look a little less clear. Possibly because they are blown up larger. Must play with the settings to try to minimize this and get the clearest picture . Free delivery went great also very professional and careful service
5,Pope John Paul II with John Voight,A very beautiful film on one of the greatest figure of the XX th century especially the first part !
5,An Amazing Film About an Amazing Man!,Everything that can be said has already been said about this film by more articulate reviewers. For my two cents worth: I absolutely despise Jon Voight (I NEVER watch any of his films) and I still loved this DVD! The subject matter transcended my biases.
5,Sweet !! (and warm),"My first Columbia coat. Now I know what the others rave about. Quality construction, lots of great features, and those touches of quality that I expected (given the accolades I have heard from others).The Edge Release jacket is not quite warm enough for the most frigid of South Dakota's winter days, but it works great for a broad range of weather at or below the freezing mark. Chalk me down as another Columbia Sportswear fan."
4,Warm!,This is a warm jacket and it was a great price but from the picture I was expecting a longer jacket and it's only a waistline style.
3,good read but a littel naive,"Dr. McWhorter takes the plight of poor or ""self-perceived"" poor African Americans and presents a common sense solution to that problem. His writing his very easy to understand and will appeal to all readers. However, his sources are questionable. Why does he use movies as sources? His documentation style could use some improvement as well.The words that came to my mind, consistently while reading, were naveté and generalizing. McWhorter never uses specific examples of African American problems and makes the problem sound like an easy fix. This of course, is not an easy fix and will take hard work in order to solve. The only question is whether or not it is the job of government or society to solve.McWhorter presents common sense solutions. Then again, common sense is not so common these days."
2,Misses the big picture,"Great premise, but McWhorter does little to address feasible solutions to the anti-intellectual culture he identifies. A boon for conservatives who would like to attribute the problem of at-risk black youth to cultural underpinnings, but a slap in the face to those who live with and try to work through the problem of inspiring and motivating black youth everyday. Read Marian Wright Edelman's The Measure of Our Success for an alternative (and ultimately, more measured) vision."
5,"Excellent, but potentially dangerous","I'm hesitant to write this review. On the one hand, I absolutely loved the book, despite having started the book hating McWhorter from what I had heard about him. As I read through the chapters, I found it harder and harder to disagree with him. He writes an excellent commentary on black American culture, and I was very satisfied that he lacked the sort of anti-black attitude so heavy in someone like Ward Connely.However, I'm worried that McWhorter's argumentation will be picked up by truly anti-black white people who will embrace and voice his ideas with the footnote ""And McWhorter's BLACK, and he said it, so you can't say I'm racist for saying..."" I'm troubled by the fact that white people who already harbor prejudices against African Americans now have yet another weapon."
3,A Fresh Perspective on a Sensitive Subject,"McWhorter, a black linguistics professor, is on to something in Losing the Race. His frankness when discussing black culture is refreshing, and his firsthand anectdotes give great weight to his arguments. More than anything else, this book covers sensitive territory which must be explored. It is an interesting read and a fresh perspective on an electric subject."
3,Recycled but worth a read,"Losing the Race, by John McWhorter, is a good book with a lot of beneficial insight. However, I have read a lot of Shelby Steele and found this book to not have any new ideas. I recommend Steele's books, and if you still want to read more on the subject check this out."
5,Compelling Writer,"While Prof. McWhorter's views will be condemned or praised depending on the reviewers' political views (I happen to agree with him), I'd like to point out that he is a superb writer. I am a dedicated reader and have been for more than 50 years. I believe that good writers are literally worth their weight in gold, but in Prof. McWhorter's case, that weight should be bestowed in diamonds!His ability to marshal and present his views is literally awe-inspiring,which is not a description I'd give to many writers today.This book is a seminal work, I feel, and should be read by anyone attempting to make sense of the current-and future- political scene."
2,"A nice opinion, but...","Losing the Race offers the conservative viewpoint of African American life, but it does little to enlighten and even less to impress readers looking for a non-biased and even handed view of the African American community. While McWhorter does vigorously use real-life situations to support his views, these situations are the extremes, the clips one can find on the evening news and not common for African American life even if they have come to represent that life by the popular media. He fails to base his opinions on the average African American's life and instead relies on generalizations about the entire black community taken from rap lyrics, political demonstrations, and gotcha newspaper headlines.Fun read for conservatives and those interested in researching the conservative view on race relations, but does little more than rehash old arguements with new extreme examples."
1,"SAME ISSUES, ANOTHER PERPESCTIVE","These issue have all been presented before, and I wish I hadn't spent my $15.00 bucks on it. Just read the books out there by Thomas Sowell and Shelby Steele to understand this authors' perspective."
2,Disappointment,"McWhorter did not include or argue varying perspectives of his 'theories' in this book. He had some good points, but they were mostly one-sided. The conservatism in this book is sickening. McWhorter is truly a conservatist and rationalist thinker, so much to the point that he ""[Loses His] Race"""
2,McWhorter is rude,"Why does Dr. McWhorter twice refer to the book ""Success Runs In Our Race"" and not cite the author, George C. Fraser? I think this is noncollegial and unprofessional.McWhorter's book is pure vitriol. If he wants to motivate African-Americans to change, he has gone about it the wrong way.I was also repulsed by his not incorporating gender nuetral pronouns. That's not ""of Berkeley caliber.""I also believe this book to be anecdotal and not research-driven."
5,You could save some money.,"You could save some money by reading the excerpt, chapter one, offered by Amazon and couple it with the review by ""Nailah"" and get a good idea of the problem. The rest of the book is insightful to the reader interested in this subject."
