4,Good collection but not quite Ultimate,"Any Liza collection omitting things like A Quiet Thing,Liza's Medley from Judy/Liza at the Palladium,A Matter of Time,Stepping Out,You Are for Loving, etc and including Love Story and Simon really isn't deserving of calling itself Ultimate"
5,A perfect match.,"Sinatra and Gershwin, a perfect match. Something magic happens whenever the two meet. This album is a lot of fun with live very spontaneous performances that have a zip that some of the studio products don't."
2,"Good puzzles, poor book","The paper on this book is like newspaper. I kept tearing thru. It was so bad I had to scan them and print them out on printer paperThe puzzles were good.I bought 6-8 books and this had the thinnest paper by far.They need to do it in a better format, with thicker paper.Did I mention the paper is to thin?"
1,Don't let this be your first book of Sudoku,"The explanatory section at the start is not adequate for a beginning solver of Sudoku. More beginning examples were needed.More beginning 4 by 4 and 6 by 6 puzzles are needed, for the beginning solver.The spine of this book cracked within 2 days of usage; this book was cheaply made.The paper is cheap; numbers from puzzles on the next page can be seen through the paper; very distracting for a solver.The tricky puzzles (level 3) are arguably just as hard as the challenging puzzles (level 5) ; the computer program and/or Mr. Huckvale did a poor job of ranking these puzzles.This book, in short, seems like a borderline hack-job, designed to cash in on the Sudoku craze."
5,Perfect for Beginners,This book is very good for beginners. It begins with small puzzles. My [...] son enjoys completing the 4x4 and 6x6 puzzles. The puzzles become larger and more complicated as the book continues. Don't be intimidated by the 16x16 puzzles...they are much easier than they look.
1,Wrong stuff... Make sure you look at the specs on this!!!,"This is a five cell battery and the Sony pcg-430 that I have uses a two cell and has a different connector. I would not recomend this item to anyone. They offered me money back, but did not care to find out if the battery was correct or not. I know it was not, because I tried installing it and thank god it has a different connector. I would of overvoltaged my board. That would of probably zapped my BIOS chip."
5,One of a number of good books on the subject,"We have several books on the subject of the Sermon on the Mount, and we wish to get several opinions on the subject. This is one of them."
4,they trashed leatherhead!!!,why did LH have to be a bad guy? cause in the new show he was a pet crocodile that mutated the same way the turtles and splinter did but in this he was from a swamp? and to make things worse:HE TEAMS UP WITH SHREDDER!!! the guy that could have easily ripped the turtles to shreds became a badguy???
2,"A poor quality light, both the light output and durability","I have purchased a set of about 50 TCP R20 14 Watt bulbs to replace all of my incandescents. After about a month, a quarter of them burned out after a normal use - about 4 hours a day. The light generated by them is cold and harsh - in spite of 2700K rating - we find ourselves not wanting to turn them on. I am about to replace them all."
5,Great munchkin bulb,"This is a little bulb I use by my front door, over some house plants in a window box. Running it for ~10 hours/day it keeps the entrance lit up, the plants growing great, and is good for 2 years at least before it starts getting dim. All for about a penny a day."
5,A Wonderfully Sweet Children's Book,"I have had this book since I was a little girl and its magic still captivates me as an adult. I now have two young daughters who I read it to and they find the same delight in the simple stories and enchanting illustrations that I did. The lessons of friendship and family are taught through the adventures of a young bunny, Little Richard and I only wish that I could find the other titles in this series. This book will be in our family as long as I can preserve it!"
5,The best college text I have yet to read!!!!!!,This was really the most interesting book I have had to read in college. I look forward to reading it again on my own time and plan on passing it on to my friends. It was really enjoyable and enlightening with great twists of events! You can read this book again and again and pull something new from it every time!
2,it's ok,didn't fit my .22 M4 that i bought it for......but it's ok cheapo bayonet /knife......price was good ......seems cheap made but it was cheap so that's ok......
2,Will not fit,"Does not fit over bird cage . The hole is to small, other than that its a fairly nice peice"
3,Item Won't Mount,This item is of acceptable quality but the barrel ring is too small to slip over the barrel on my Stag-15 H-BAR.
5,Bud K Great!!!,Bud k definatly delivers for the price great blade great price on time actually ahead of time Ill buy from them again....
2,You get what you pay for,"The price was right so I purchased the M-16 bayonet.Though the product is not the real thing, it does the job for the price."
2,Disappointment.,"I had high hopes for this bayonet. Well I guess I shouldn't even call it a bayonet. I had high hopes for this ""Bayonet Looking Knife"". That's better. Anyways regardless of how it looks the muzzle ring and locking mechanism while appearing to look like they're the right size will not fit a real life M-16. This ""Bayonet Looking Knife"" is also of a cheap construction and feels like the handle may break off eventually. But I guess what should you expect for a $16 ""Bayonet Looking Knife"" anyways? Regardless of this it is still a cool looking and decent and functioning ""Bayonet Looking Knife"" for only $16. So it wasn't a total loss. But I stress again ""THIS WILL NOT FIT ON A REAL M16""!"
1,poor excuse for bayonet for any AR,nice looking display knife not a functional bayonet as it will not go over a flash suppressor now just sits in the corner.
4,Good bayonet for the price,If you are looking for an M-16 bayonet keep in mind this is a Chinese made replica. This bayonet is based on the American made M7 Bayonet but it is not genuine. It actually has a much larger blade (9 inches vs 6.75 inches) than an M7. Also the blade does not have a black finish anti-rust coating like an M7. This does not fit an M-16 or AR-15 although I've heard of some people modifying it so it can fit on an AR-15.Now this bayonet is a good buy for the price. It is well built for the low cost and can handle abuse. It makes a great utility/hunting knife. The 9 in. blade is intimidating and impressive. A genuine M7 costs upwards of $50 and is much better quality but this replica is perfect for dirty work. The sheath is functional but won't hold up to long term use.If you want a bayonet that works on an M-16 or AR-15 get an Ontario M-7 or M7B or M9 Bayonet. The M9 is over $100.
5,VOCAL HOUSE AT ITS BEST,THEY JUST DON'T MAKE HOUSE LIKE THIS ANYMORE-THIS ALBUM IS WHAT TRUE SOULFUL HOUSE IS ALL ABOUT-THE HOUSE FROM THE MID 80'S AND EARLY 90'S WHICH GOT ITS START FROM THE CLUBS IN CHICAGO-THE LEAD SINGER SOUNDS LIKE THE LEGENDARY SYLVESTER-THE BASS PLAYING IS THUMPING-AND I LOVE THE PIANO PLAYING TOO-MARSHALL JEFFERSON'S INFLUENCE ON TEN CITY'S MUSIC IS OBVIOUS-THEY NEED TO PUT OUT A NEW ALBUM-BECAUSE THE DANCE MUSIC TODAY CAN'T COMPARE-
3,Memories,"I remember seeing this on TV when I was very young, and was very happy to find it on Amazon.... the sound and picture is not great, hence only three stars.... but what the hell, I am in heaven when I see it! Roddy McDowell is excellent, and Daniel Emilfork as the Genie....priceless."
3,Culture as a way of life.,"This fantastic movie was shown on the big screen here during the 1980s.Many youngsters must have had their first dose of an alternate cultureother than the creole one prevalent!!An entertainment which takes you on a magic carpet ride and encounters with airbourne horsemen!!A STRONG FLAVOUR from the east; it brings a nostalgic appeal to our senses, reminding usof another reality which must have been our own sometime in the remote past!!!The genie does it well, making many beggars ride a wishing horse!!!"
4,Good Music from a Crumby Movie,"Save your money. Don't rent the Movie, just buy the Music. For the life of me I can't remember anything important about the movie except there were two women fighting over Willie, pretty much a redneck dream come true! The music is solid though, especially the guest appearances from Emmy Lou Harris and Hank Cockran. Pretty much here's the upshot: Willie has too many albums and not enough good songs on them. This one though collects some of his best songs, so it's definitely worth having. For me, I rank this one in the top 10 for Willie."
3,Tarot Card Kit,"I actually had this sent somewhere else so I have no idea about its quality, etc. They said they received it, is about all I can say."
3,ONLY FOR 20-20 VISION,"I have many different tarot decks I use in my personal life and professional work as a counselor. I was particularly pleased to find one like this that explores corresponances between tarot and other symbol systems. The book is very useful for that, but the cards are too small for all the information included on each card. If you don't have 20/20 vision or stronger, forget it. It is impossible to read all the images...the cards need to be a larger format to be more user friendly. I looked at them once, put them back in the box and have not used them since...will probably give them to one of my younger students. I also would not recommend them for a beginning tarot student...too much information. For an advanced student of metaphysical philosopy and symbol systems the information is useful."
4,the quest tarot book and card pack,"they are as stated by others very small print. That is the only con i can find. The book has so much information about the cards it makes up for the small print. LOL. The art on the cards is a bit unusual but that is why i like them. there is so much information on them, they are a joy to work with."
4,Didn't jibe with me,"I bought this tarot because it's beautiful, and it's been well-reviewed. I still think it's really pretty, but I ended up giving it to a friend. I tried a couple of readings with it, and it just didn't really read well for me. I'm sure it's a good deck though, based on what others have said about it."
2,"Great Idea, Needs Work Though...","I just got this book/deck set and I found it MUCH more complex than led to believe by it's outside cover touts. There is a LOT of stuff on each card from many diverse traditions, It does not remind me of ""Ouija"" at all and to get all you can a lot of book study is involved. The other thing I found as a let down was the suggested card meanings, even some pictures seem ""taken"" direct from the Crowley ""Thoth"" Deck itself. (i.e. 4 of Swords = Truce). I was more excited reading about it than I was after opening the box, as well as need a magnifying glass to read some of the ""letters"" that are supposed to ""Spell Out"" words & Messages. It has potential, but needs more ""fine tuning"" and in my opinion, was most likely prematurely released. Sorry."
1,Sony VAIO not worth your time,"Sony not only will require you to buy expensive external equipment to diagnose *any* problems (of which there are MANY-my motherboard died horribly, took out most of the guts with it) causing you to spend almost $500 more to do *their* jobs for them.Don't even think about spending money on an extended warranty, its just a way for them to get your money and then, again, they make you purchase more expensive hardware to do any diagnosing before they will even talk to you on the phone.Sony is not a company I will be dealing with ever again...buy ANYTHING but a Sony... you can't afford all the parts you need to do THEIR job for them."
4,"Very Impressive, but doesn't replace a laptop.","I have been using this machine for almost a year now. I use it in place of my desktop and have it loaded to the gills with dual monitors and tons of software, including AutoCAD. It is networked to all our other PC's and handles everything great. It is a bit slower at times, but faster than some of the other PC's on the network. The only feature I don't use is the Singular mobile internet. I tether it to my BT EDGE phone and it works pretty fast. It is a bit awkward to use as a laptop, and if I had to do it again, I would probably get a really small and powerfull laptop."
2,Battery life sucks!,"i bought mine a year and a half ago..cons:my battery lasts only 10minutes sometimes less..! and even the newest versions come with the same type of battery. it also comes with bunch of junk programs i had to go trough and delete almost every program that came with it. recovery system takes about 10gb of memory +windows and else. expensive replacements and parts. keyboard and buttons are bad almost no use.. vs.pros:i gues this doesnt need much explainingsmall slick design, easy to carry, touch screen(a litle hard to use),sim card slot: you can have internet anywhere a cellphone would work(i called sony and made them unlock it and used it with t-mobile which is around $30 cheaper than cingular a month,2built in cameras,microphone(i couldnt use much on msn but i dont know maybe its me)"
5,Very Good Product!,"--Much better than a palm pilot -- it really is a real laptop that fits in your pocket--It only has 1 USB but I bought a USB expansion port thing that gives me 4 USB ports and plugged it into this thing and it worked great--I live in Canada and can not use the Cingular wireless built in...but I have a Telus wireless account with a Sierra cellular wireless USB card and can surf the net, get remote access from anywhere :) Great if you want to remotely administer your computers from handheld device -- but you have to remember to carry your wireless modem in another pocket.--I have full Office 2000, Internet Explorer 7, remote acess software, and everything running on it. Only problem is that Internet Explorer 7 has this 1 update that doesn't want to install.--It does eveything as advertised!"
1,"made for Homita HPU701 DVD player, fell apart after first charge","I bought this battery for a different player as it did not matter to me as long as it worked. well it worked ok when I first tried it out, of course physically it did not snap on the back like it would if I used it with the HPU 701 player. I noticed when it first came in the package there were 2 loose screws, but I had plenty more screws left to hold it together so I thought nothing of it, then I charged it up for the first time and when I came back many hours later the rest of the back had popped off and now all the screws had popped out. Upon close look the plastic that holds the front and back together had cracked around all the screw sites. When you just feel the plastic you can notice it is almost to crumble in your fingers. [...]"
2,A Classic,"This book goes far beyond what to lead based on your hand. (i.e top of a sequence, or 4th best)The author presents the reader with many bidding scenarios and ask you what to lead, based on the bidding. Then he explains the correct lead. He spends most of the book explaining how to look for clues from the bidding. Plus he presents some interesting lead directing bids and doubles.Only for those who want to invest some time in improving this vital aspect of the game.*BEWARE* that the same person posted 4 reviews here and gave the book 5 stars each time, skewing the results.Its a great book, but I dislike people who skew the ratings on purpose."
5,Recommended,"This book was cited as a quality resource for intermediate+ players in a recent class on ""Opening Leads"". I found it to be very helpful, clear and concise, and full of examples."
5,Advice on what to lead,Easy-to-read and well-written advice on what to lead against all types of contracts.
5,Awesome exposition of Revelation,"This has been one of my most enjoyable and accurate reads of Revelation I've read so far. It's an easy read, very informative, gives numerous historical background, and grants a response to those who hold to the dispensational view of this book(Revelations). I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to study Revelation IN IT'S PROPER CONTEXT...rather than reading into this book an over 2,000 year old, still not fulfilled, futuristic twist that most Americans put on this book. I hope this book is used to clear up much of the controversy of the believed to be still future Beast/Antichrist talk that goes around in the Christian community once and for all. I can only pray God's truth will go out thanks to this book, rather than false interpretations and fairy-tales."
3,Interesting Views,"This book has some interesting views but I do not believe that they are truly Biblical. However, neither are many other things BIBLICAL that ARE being taught, in the Church, TODAY!I gave it three stars because I believe that we need to be OPEN and consider other possible views. We might be wrong and the other view correct BUT we will NEVER know if we are CLOSED minded and unteachable. ""...examine all things, hold fast to that which is good..."" I Thes. 5:21Many are afraid to TRY or examine all things because their faith is too weak, but fear that they could lose what little faith they have. So they go on repeating the same errors, that the church has been passing on for 1,500 years, the ""Traditions and teaching of MEN""!"
2,Disappointed in product quality,I am upset about the quality of this dvd. It will not play all the way through due to skipping in the video about 3/4 of the way into it.
5,Wow....,Every teacher should see this. My son has learning disabilities. I bought it for me. I'm hoping that his teachers will be willing to watch this. It gave me so much empathy for him. I almost cried at the thougt of what he goes through daily.
5,All educators should watch this,"This is a great DVD about understanding the learning disabled. I believe that all educators should watch this presentation, so when they have a learning disabled child in their class they would be more understanding and helpful."
4,How Difficult Can This Be: Understanding Learning Disabilities,"A must-see for all parents and teachers of children with Learning Disabilities, particularly useful for parents of children with mild disabilities."
5,A great book to start with,"While working at a 9 to 5 job, I read this book, and it got me thinking that I could write non-fiction books. I followed Robert's advice and wrote a proposal, which got accepted by a publisher. I immediately quit my job. I'm now writing my third non-fiction book."
4,SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED TOSH: THE EARLY YEARS,"This compilation is made up of sides that Tosh recorded between 1971-73, predating 'Legalize It'. We get to hear 'Maga Dog' and 'Burial' as they sounded before reaching later albums and there's material produced by Joe Gibbs as well as Peter himself. One gets a glimpse of the solo star to come with what's on here and if you like early roots or rocksteady, check it out. I'm glad someone thought to release this collection so Tosh could get more of the shine he deserves. For reviewers whose more critical opinion of this I've read, I implore you to listen again."
3,"Good songs, bad collection.","I don't know who makes the choices for all these ""Millennium"" collections, but they're never that great. These ten tracks are mostly good ""Tosh"", but they're just too few, and so much is missing. I'd go with ""The Best Of Peter Tosh"", ""The Toughest"", or any other collection."
3,Some questions can't be answered in simplistic terms,I would recommend this book for a child...they might find it cute. I did get a few good obscure facts out of it. The format was wierd because some of these questions can't be answered in a little paragragh and at times it seemed like it was saying nothing. I would not really recommend this book unless you just have lots of time to waste. There are better fact books out on the market...I will leave it at that.
4,Gain bundles of trivia in one sitting,"Good book, easily read in no time. Tidbits of trivia, stuff you know and stuff you had no idea of! Fun and informative without being heavy and boring. Great to read while waiting in the doctors office, traveling, or dare I say, whilst spending time in the bathroom! When can we expect number two... book that is?"
4,Thread of Decency,This book helped me to understand more fully the corruption that takes place in big business. A very suspenseful mystery and compelling read!! Kudos to this author...
5,I Like'em,"I purchased a set of these flares on my 2005 Rubicon after installing a lift and going to a larger tire. They take time to properly install, but once in place they look great and keep the mud/rocks off of my doors and windows. The most difficult part (aside from removing the wheel-well liners on the rear of the Jeep) was installing the rubber strip on the new flares. If you use some masking tape to hold the strip in place every few inches, you will have a much easier time of it. It also would have been nice if Bushwhacker could have included a couple of spare bolts/nuts in the kit just in case."
1,Hand in Glove?,"The gloves were too tight for my hands.The inside seams in the gloves abbraided my hands and caused bleeding.I don't have a large hand, ie.,I wear a cadet medium in a golf glove.Its time to prune the roses and I'm without a decent pair of gloves."
5,Gritty but heartwarming,"I loved this movie. Watching this movie you can see that Cathy Bates is on the path to becoming an Oscar Winner and the kids are all heartbreakers. Great movie, great cast, great story! I highly recommend it."
1,"Very cheap looking movie, terrible script & awful acting!","Kathy Bates is very vulgar in this movie and it's so poorly made that I was surprised to learn it was not made for the Hallmark Channel because they air this turkey about once a month.Save your money for a real movie like Anaconda with the great Jon Voight or Prison Heat with Lori Jo Hendrix.Also, no matter what the DVD package claims, the old man from the Karate Kid movies is NOT in this movie.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!"
4,True Story,This is a great True Story about a struggling family. Makes you appretiate every little thing
1,Buy a different trumpet...,"I bought this trumpet for myself as an adult student. It is a beautiful piece and very unique, but it is very poor quality. The case came broken and the trumpet leaks air. There was no invoice included for the company and no information on the supposed ""warranty"" that is included. For a child student, it might be worth the money since they tend to not stick with it. If anyone is serious about continuing their education though, I would look for a different better quality instrument-or at the very least, plan on upgrading later."
2,"Looks cool, bad quality","This trumpet looks cool, then the paint chips and keys stick. Dont waste your money"
1,For Beginners only,"I am a very serious trumpet player and thought it would be sweet to have a black trumpet. I found out that it has a low warranty and is for beginners. I didn't buy it, but I want to let any other serious trumpet players that this would probably not be a very good choice."
3,OK intro for students who lack proper mathematical maturity.,"I took my first abstract algebra class at a university with a strong math program (thru a college release program my high school was offering). We used Gallian's text. The text offers a decent intro to this beautiful subject, but its strong applied flavor may be disagreeable to many mathematicians. Also, the treatment of algebra in this text can hardly be considered rigorous. The text does not suit my tastes, it should be used for mathematical physics classes (or some other field where applied abstract algebra is needed).I recommend two textbooks I checked out from the library to supplement my class (for a fuller, more rigorous treatment of algebra). These are 'Algebra' by Michael Artin, and 'Topics in Algebra' by I.N. Herstein."
2,I've read worse,"This book is disorganized and is not well-written. The examples are decent, but that's about the only good thing about the book. Definitions and theorems are horribly explained and it's really hard to learn.I'm a math major and I learned more abstract algebra from my proofs book than this one. I would not recommend it."
3,Satisfied,"I was pleased with the book, ""Jewels of Light"" after having gone to the National Cathedral in Washington, D. C. recently. I wanted to recapture the information from the tour in written form to read at my leisure. This book provided me with doing just that.The transaction was quick and satisfactory.E. Moxley"
4,Sindhi how is written,"This sindhi grammar describes the language how it is written, in arabic characters and very easy to understand. Also shows the corresponding devanagari written. And by it we can begin a solid study of this language of north of India and Pakistan."
3,REview,"This product would be better if it had pictures to sequence also. As is, the product is all text."
2,Shivering Mechanism does not work,"The Snow Miser 12"" plush doll is very nice, but the shivering mechanism stopped with the first pull on the string. We purchased this product in January in anticipation of a grandchild's birthday in late February. We did not check it out until two days ago and found the problem. Although our grandchild will undoubtedly like the doll, it is disappointing that the mechanism does not work."
5,snow miser,"perfect condition...love it and have it on display on my ""winter"" shelf in my front hall!I really don't have anything else to say...lol"
3,Ignore This Release,"This is an edited version of the ""Blasters Of The Universe"" album. Like the other guy said, get that one instead."
5,Best Roller Set I found,"I looked everywhere for a good roller set for short hair. This product was hghly recommended everywhere I looked on the Internet. It heats up quickly and curls are firm and solid. Unfortunately, my all over hair was too short for the smallest rollers so I had to return it - no problem with this 'seller' I got my money back immediately. But, it does deserve a 5 STAR. Don't hesitate on this one."
3,hotstter pro 20: 1321,"the specs said they were wax core rollers, they are not. they are o.k. better than the velvet covered rollers i have which are useless.have not been able to find clairol wax core rollers like the ones i have from 20 years ago,they are falling apart one me."
4,Good 'n Hot,These curlers get quite hot and provide just the curl I was looking for. The only reason I didn't give it a 5-star is the case...the lid seems to be a bit flimsy but I think it will hold up fine for home use.
3,Still Debating,I haven't decided yet if I'm keeping this item or not. Some of the clips seem to be a little too large for the roller so sometimes the rollers don't stay in place. I would like less of the large rollers and more of the small and medium ones. So I'm still holding judgment on this set. It is hard to find a set similar and I've been using this type for many years. I've tried other types to no avail. I did like that a couple extra rollers were added.
4,Prequel to the John the Eunuch Mysteries,"This volume jumps back to 525 and relates the beginning of John's career from slave to Lord Chamberlain. I enjoy this series for the unusual historical setting in sixth century Constantinople with rich descriptions of life in the city on the Bosporus. John is teamed with Felix of the Palace guard who slowly begins to appreciate the slave's talents: ""At least I know you can handle yourself in a fight."" We meet the dying Justin, his successor Justinian, and Theodora who ""does not enjoy the notion of Justinian being grateful to anyone except her."""
4,I'll read more of the series,I'm planning a trip to Turkey and wanted to read books set there. I enjoyed this book and will be reading more of the series.
3,good starter,"A reference book for start up cgmp's and sanitation on food plant, allways a good help for improve it every day."
2,This Blows!,"No matter what type of artistic liberty that one may take in interpreting other band's music, one should never slaughter what was truely some of the best music ever made in the 20th century. I have a sense of humor and could appreicate if this album were a parity of sorts..but I don't hear it that way. I think if someone were to carry out the brilliant idea of covering an entire album, they should do it with creative freedom, not complete idiocy. I guess I just didn't get it. It was painful to listen to!"
1,Tusk is a FM record,"the idiotic music fan from Chicago needs to get his head straight. Are you on crack? How can you put down the people who wrote all this stuff and give the album 5 stars. Idiot. Anyway, if you wanna hear the good stuff...the REAL stuff, get yourself the real thing. You wont be dissapointed."
5,A fine and sensitive insight into the passages of women,"Bonnie Horrigan has served a fine favor to women whoconfront the mysterious passage of menopause asboth a physical and a spiritual transition. Sheprovides answers with compassion, depth withclarity, and wisdom without complexity.Ms. Horrigan has created a book which all men and all womenwill do well to absorb as part of their life-insights collection."
4,Such postive mentors !,"How wonderful to find such positive guides and mentors in this cofusing time of life. The loss of our menstrual cycle makes us disconnect for a while from our own rhythms, passing through the menopausal journey is an in-between state, and it's easy to be confused about our own place in the whole scheme of things.These women have been there, and they have words to guide"
5,Good read,I have just started reading this book. So far it is quite interesting and educational in how we misinterprete others that are Deaf or have some other disability.
3,Class requirement,"This book was on a list of 15 books for a speech disorder class. I chose it based on the information that was provided by Amazon, which was very accurate. The book provides insight of deaf and hard of hearing individuals who are mainstreamed in public schools, often feeling isolated and frustrated. I would recommend the book to any who is interested in knowing more about Deaf culture and the obstacles individuals encounter."
4,very interesting. a different type of grappling video,"it's a documentary of Eddie's earlier tournies. in between matches he does a mock MTV cribs thing that's kinda funny. I enjoyed it, but don't rewatch it much."
3,Good and not what I'd hoped for.,"After buying and LOVING Eddie's ""Master the Rubber Guard"" I'd thought that ""The Twister"" DVD would be very similar. Well... it's not. The Twister dvd show's about 10 of Eddie's matches leading up to and including some of his ADCC matches. It also show's some other ""filler"" material that seems a bit ""out of place."""
5,Best smelling dog rinse out there on the market today,I have tried many different brands and always come back to this one. It is the BEST smelling creme rinse ever. Plus it last a long time and makes your dog's coat super soft. Love it. Don't try anything else you will waste your money. I'm throwing out all the others and sticking to this brand only. I can't find it in the regular stores anymore either. So glad it is online.
3,Good but not Great,"I felt this book was more about the specifics of wether or not to become legal guardians. It lacked information on specific state requirements and offered limited resource information. I thought To Grandma's House We...Stay was much better, especially from an emotional viewpoint."
4,Worth reading if you want to get closer to Christ,I received this book as a gift from a dear friend who I served with as a Marine sniper in Vietnam. I find it inspiring and touching if you are on a path to get closer to Christ. The Author is a Minister of many years and he weaves those years in pursuit of a relationship with the Savior into his work.
2,Sorry - I couldn't get interested,"I was prepared to love this book, based on the reviews posted so far and my general love of travel and books about other cultures. While it is written well, I found it disappointing - the characters weren't fully drawn, the situations weren't interesting - overall, it just didn't grab me. And it's a lot of money for such a slim volume. If you want a good read about buying a house in Italy and adjusting to life there, try Extra Virgin instead."
3,lightweight description of a year in tuscany,"Found this book by accident on the shelves of a large library. Caught my eye because while most of the genre of travelogue books of folks trying to make a living and remodeling a farm house in tuscany usually sticks to the ""traditional"" tuscany, these authors went for the ""unknown"" tuscany, the Maremma.I was a little disappointed, as this area actually is more interesting and colorful than the book describes. Its characters are intrinsically complex, bound by a history of farm economy and recent migration. However, not much was dwelled into these characters. Maybe it takes several years to get to know the intimate lives of the folks living there. But something could have been said about the other foreigners living in the same area, and how they fared."
1,The worst book I've read about Tuscany,"This book was the 5th memoir book I've read about life in the Tuscan region of Italy. I was very perplexed why the authors even decided to write it, why they've decided to live there, why ...... They were very sarcastic about the Tuscan life, its people, its traditions and its values, making fun of everything and everyone in a mean spirited way. They went so far as to make fun of the Italian cuisine and say that nothing is like eating at McDonald's restaurants in the US or eating peanut butter sandwitches for lunch or ...... Why they've decided to live there is a mystery to me and this book was a big disappointment."
3,It should have been a little longer,"The book was enjoyable. I would have loved for it to be a little longer. Some topics or stories could have been expounded on longer. I also read ""Extra Virgin ... "" by Annie Hawes and it sounds like Maremma is close to the small town she wrote about. From the description of the house, it sounds like it turned out to be gorgeous, they sould have included a picture of some of the decor of the house. I enjoy reading this genre of books, please keep them coming. I will be reading ""Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town"" by Michael Rips soon."
4,the complete works,touch 1 released early 1980 touch 2 was never released the album was to be titled fools exit mounting cost delays it didnt happen eventuall surface at the end of the 1990s as touch the complete works the debut is a long lost classic
4,Giants on the Roam,"I became interested in the Spiderwick Chronicles when I heard of the movie. The Nixies Song was pretty good with creature types{nixies and giants} but it was not as good as the original series. Nick and Laures were interesting,but not as much as Jared,Simon and the rest.At the end they meet a giant killer who seems like if is going to help kill giants,but I do not trust him.Overall it is a good book,but not as good as the first."
2,It really is beyond....,"My son and I have read the Spiderwick Chronicles, own the movie and have listened to the audio books. I bought this to carry on and wow, I had to remind him of words we don't use that they said on the audio. These words: Lard a**, idiot and loser all directed at step siblings. I didn't enjoy the narrator either, his tone just sounded bitter. The other reviews were right on. Just a fair warning."
2,160 boring pages - not worth reading for any age,"Once again, excellent illustrations, but perhaps slightly less interesting than the books of the first series. I say this, as both the main character and the turtle-faced monster (to not give anything away) are uninspired.But the storytelling, which was weak in the first series is, incredibly, even thinner here, despite having many more pages.First, you reach the end and feel you've read the first chapter of twenty-five. This is not good if the book is 160+ pages and you feel you've had a chapter's worth of story. (Okay, maybe two.)Second, there's too much narrative and not enough dialog.Third, it's boring and uninteresting. Even the characters in the book seem bored with the story. This just isn't good.Too bad the Editor at Simon & Schuster didn't reject the text...guess that would have thrown off their publishing schedule and, we can't have that, can we?Very disappointed and I will not buy any future books written by Holly Black."
2,Big disappointment,"I am extremely disappointed with this new book. The crude language is so unnecessary to the story line. I bought several copies of the first series for my elementary school library. These are the target readers, in elementary school. Good writing of any kind does not need to be littered with poor language. There are so many other good choices out there, so my advice to to choose another book."
5,Thanks for the memories,"Rosemary Clooney is my favorite female vocalist, and this compliation is a wonderful tribute to a great lady. Thanks to Michael Feinstein, her friend and fellow performer, for bringing us this lovely retrospective of some of her best. I especially enjoy the three tracks recorded with Benny Goodman. Most of these songs are available on other disks, but this is an excellent listen. If you love this, try ""Love"", ""Blue Rose"" and ""Deddicated to Nelson"" for her early work, and any of the Concord Jazz recordings for her mature voice."
5,Like rare wine Rosemary got better as the years passed.,"I was a fan of Rosemary Clooney when she first appeared on the scene. White Christmas, with Bing Crosby, was Rosemary's break thru performance. After a difficult time in life Rosemary re-appeared and began singing in Jazz clubs around the country. Her voice and interpretation of the songs on this CD are superb. This CD is a treasure."
2,I'VE HEARD BETTER,"I HAVE ESTIMATED THAT MY AMAZON CD PURCHASES NUMBER ABOUT 30 AND THE QUALITY OF THOSE CDS HAS BEEN TOP-NOTCH; SO...IT'S DIFFICULT TO THINK THAT A ROSEMARY CLOONEY CD COULD ""GO WRONG"" BUT THIS ONE WAS A BAD CHOICE...WELL, I MADE THE CHOICE AND DID NOT SAMPLE THE WARES. THE SOUND TRACK IS CLEARLY INFERIOR AND UNEVEN..A FEW SELECTIONS WERE ENJOYABLE BUT FOR THE MOST PART; A THUMBS DOWN ON THIS ON CD."
5,Good book,The book was helpful. I build a bed and this book gave me some pointers. I'm sure it will be more useful in the future. I just had a different design style than what was in the book.
5,Better than Cocked & Loaded,"This CD really lives up to the hype I'd read in interviews with Tracii Guns. He claimed that this would be a true metal album--a cross between Iron Maiden and early Scorpions. Well, he was right. This is probably their best album to date, which doesn't happen often with new albums from bands that were popular in the 80's (think of Generation Swine and Hollyweird, to name a few). Check out Revolution and Hellraiser's Ball."
1,NOT THE REAL PRODUCT,"THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT THEY ARE ADVERTISING!! The product that they sent was a different style. I called them, they said they couldnt accept a return (which is understandable) but that the real product was out of stock. They then said that they would order the product and ship it to us. It was at least 2 weeks and I still hadnt received anything so I called and they said that they had ""discontinued"" the product and that they wouldnt be able to give me a refund. It wasnt until I brought up false advertising and possibly contacting someone else about getting a refund (amazon) that they put me on hold and got a manager. THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT THAT THEY ARE ADVERTISING they are horrible at customer service this company sucks."
3,Toooooo big!,"The product is life like---very life like. However it is vey bendable even with the vac u lock plug inserted inside it. It seems doc Johnson don't have a reliable ruler my wife bought the 5"" with the harness that one measures only 4"" long. I bought this for my wife it measures 7 1/4 "" yes I did measure it the right way!!!!!Doc Johnson needs a ruler!!!!"
5,Worth the extra cost,PROS:Easy and quick to useCONS:Does not last as long as the capped versionsI liked this so much I bought them for all my office staff as well. Will never go back to caps.
3,"Nice, but... (besides, I need some help)","The CD is kinda nice, but... I actually can't remember where in the movie were most of the songs that are in this CD. Where did the guys get this thing from???Besides that, does anyone know which song is that one which is played when Hal is dancing with the three ugly girls?"
2,not what I expected,Not all the songs in the movie are on the cd. My wife was disappointed that the club scene song was not on this cd. Would not have bought this product if I knew that.
3,Who knows this song???,"RIGHT after hal meets rosemary.. right at the beginning of the scene in the fast foor restaurant there is a song playing that you can only hear clearly for 3 seconds and then in the background. Its a female singer and the words sound like ""somewhere, over this"" or ""over there"".I have searched the net high and low but I cannot figure out what song this is!Someone please help me!"
1,THE SONG I CAN'T FIND,"The song is played when Rosie and Hal have sex, and then again at the end at the party. It's slow and I need to find it."
3,The Song NO-ONE knows,"Ok the song that I think alot of people are looking for. The soft piano music, plays when he sees Cadence a second time in the burn unit. And Several other times through-out the movie. I'm positive that it is. ""One Day""Written, Performed and Produced by Billy Goodrum. Problem is, Billy Goodrum doesn't make cd's...and he isn't on ANY of the file sharing programs. Good Luck getting hold of the actual song. If you do manage...please post here."
3,So much missing,"For a film whose credit reads ""original music by Ivy"", it's curious why there is no music by Ivy on the soundtrack CD. What is here is a selection of songs from the film that provides a pretty good feel of the film's soundtrack, but without several key numbers. It's sad that there was a place for a ""bonus"" track that did not appear in the film while so much good music that underscored some of the film's highlights was omitted."
2,"once again,songs are missing.....","this soundtrack follows the same ANNOYINGtradition as cds like Bring it on.the cd lacks some important songsthat were in the movie.Some easy to find songs from sherylcrow,neil young and edison lighthouseare there but what about the tracks fromivy?there isnt any here.What about thatsong in the dance club when hal danceswith 3 girls?not here.What about thatsong towards the end when hal goes tothe house in a car?not here.Some of the songs on this cd simplydont hold up alot without the companyof the images of the movie.Filmmakers should learn to avoid puttingsongs in a movie which that cant seem tobe able to put on a cd."
2,Don't Bother,"I noticed several others before me were looking for the same song as I was when I purchased this CD. In my opinion, it was the best song in the movie which did not end up on the soundtrack. The name of the song is ""Comfort Eagle"" and the group is Cake. This is the 2nd to last song where Hal is driving to the house, and it also ends up in its entirety during the credits. The rest of the soundtrack is forgettable."
3,"Great Soundtrack, worth it for Phoenix alone!","The film has a fantastic soundtrack, just a shame some are missed off the CD, french band Phoenix's song Too young is missing in the part of the film, where Hal is dancing with the 3 girls, although another great song by them, summer days is still on there. Some other great songs are missing which is a shame like cake. Overall this cd is average, as some songs are mised off probably better to buy it on dvd, and buy the phoenix album, united as it is class"
2,Emilio - the song played in the cab scene ...,"When Hal's in the cab with the girl, the song playing is called ""Edge of the Ocean"" by Ivy. I really liked it too. If you like that song then you'll LOVE ""Fade into You"" by Mazzy Star.Your Welcome !!! ;-)"
3,Can't find this one song,Ok....so i have tried everything to find the name and group of this one song. It is played throughout the movie. The three parts are right after Hal gets rejected by his neighbor at the water fountain in the beginning of the movie. The same song is played again right up until Jason Alexander drives up along side Jack Black while walking down the street. It plays one more time when Hal sees Rose at the party. Please let me know the name of this song. Im having real trouble finding it.
1,to answer your question,The only song I wanted off the soundtrack was This is my world.That is the name of the song playing when they made love for the first time.
1,Ugh,I'm just wondering where the most obvious song is at; Whole Lotta Rosie by AC/DC. I mean c'mon! Its better than paying Sheryl Crow to do a song.
3,What's that song....?,I'm looking for the song that was on the movie (but not on the soundtrack) that has a jazzy type of feel...it periodically came in and out of the movie. It had a piano playing. I looked on the songlist but still could not find which song it was.
4,Can't find that song...,"OK Shallow Hal.. what a movie. It was great and all, and there is this song, the one when he first sees Rosemary, when he's driving talking to Mercusio about him leaving the club the night before. he sees rosemary and that music starts. i don't have the album, but does anyone know the name of that song? it was on trigger happy tv too, like wednesay 3/17 @ 2, i think.thanks"
1,i need 2 know...,what is the name of the song when theyre making love... when she has on purple longurie?
3,The ending title song,"The cool sounding song at the end of ""Shallow Hal"" after that happy one is called ""Building a Religion"" and it's by the band ""Cake"".Just thought I'd let ya'll know cause alot of you guys were asking about it."
3,Folk song,I need to know the name of the song that the large guy is singing on the bench when Hal goes into the Peace Corps headquarters.
2,missing many songs from the film,"A soundtrack gets its power from the combination of images with the song. There were a lot of great songs from the movie yet they are not on this lame soundtrack. The soundtrack is okay, the best songs are from Sheryl Crow and Hootie but the songs that are most memorable from the film are missing.I understand that there were probably licensing issues precluding use but that is what makes the soundtrack good...to re-live the euphoria from the film."
1,Who's the airhead that picked these songs?,"I was really looking forward to buying this cd as I really liked the soundtrack but after seeing the track selection I changed my mind. How can you leave Ivy off the soundtrack when this artist was so prevalent throughout the movie??? The first song ""Members Only"" was actually one of the weakest songs in the movie but I guess was put in as bait for Sheryl Crow fans. Anyway, what a terrible job of track selection for this soundtrack- I'll pass!"
2,Unable to see any real results,"I have ulcerative colitis, so I know a thing or two about intestinal health. During the eight months that I tried Primal Defense caplets, I didn't notice any change in my overall health. I'm not saying it doesn't work, I'm just saying that if it did, I was unable to tell (and $30.00 a bottle is a lot to pay for something if you don't know if it's working)."
4,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING PRODUCT,"I have suffered from stomach pains for years that worsened after giving birth to my child. I would get sharp abdominal pains every single time I had to go to the bathroom. I was diagnosed with IBS and lactose intolerance. I tried altering my diet but it didn't seem to help. After speaking with a friend and hearing about her experience with Garden of Life Primal I just had to give it a try. After about of week of taking the capsules and with healthy diet and exercise I saw results. I no longer had that huge pouch that I would ALWAYS get after eating or drinking anything. I also had no more gas or abdominal pains. I am not sure if anyone has experienced a change in their appetite but I definitely do not eat as much as I used to anymore. Two weeks into taking these pills I had a moment where I even cried, because after suffering from nausea, gas, and sharp pains in my stomach for so long I never imagined I would ever find relief. I definitely recommend this product."
4,Real Power all kinds of fiddling,"FRom the opening ""Don't Let the Deal Go Down"" through all the Black, Midwestern, Greek, Cajun, Arab, Slavic, and other fiddling from across the United States, this is a real listenable record whether you play the fiddle or not. The title power fiddling is apt because the selections here are not wimpy or tender or without impact. Fiddling across the world, long before many cultures adopted the violin, has been the power that swung dancers' feet, hips, butts, and everything else around. Among both African Americans and European Americans fiddling, usually played solo or with percussion was the main source of dance music until the 20th Century.You will see why when you listen to this CD. If you put it in your CD player it will be hard to get it out because you will keep wanting to hear this."
2,"Great features, poor construction","I have read consistant reviews on all the different sizes of this drive of poor constructions - the plastic breaks very easily. But this was the ONLY drive on the market that had the features I want - specificly, encrypted and non-encrypted portions, non-U3, and the ability to attach a lanyard/keychain to the actual drive, NOT THE CAP (which is a really stupid idea - one day you'll wind up with a cap and a missing drive).Unfortunately, its all true - The cap has complete disintegrated after carrying the drive around for a few months. I can buy more, but I resent having to do so. Additionally, one of the two snaps that holds the caps on has also broken off, and that I CAN'T replace unless I replace the entire drive. So far the cap is not falling off, but if the other one falls off..."
2,Disappointing,"This toy didn't hold the 5 year old's attention for long. It doesn't really make different forms. If you just make sure the background color is alway the same, you get the figure. It would be helpful if the pictures of the figures were on the front, so the child could see them and match them, rather than on the back. Cute idea, but ended up being a flop."
2,What a load of junk!,"This thing came in a lot of pieces that need to be assembled.The wrong side piece was sent,and the back of this thing is made of cardboard!"
2,Surprised and dissappointed,"To my ears a very dissappointing set. The musicianship and production values are excellent. That is the problem for me. The spark and energy and life I have come to enjoy from John Cale live are missing. Hidden behind technically profficent sound. Then again I am someone who enjoys John Constable's oil sketches far more than his finished paintings. The bonus DVD is mis-represented, ""exclusive live footage,"" well this is actually 45 minutes of disjointed rehearsal footage. And I did not find it particularly engaging, other record companies have served their artists much better with 'in the rehearsal rooms' videos. I still very much enjoy John Cale, but not how he is presented here."
5,Great Teaching Aid,We are doing the website series by Mr. Fann in our Sunday School Class. This book is a greataddition to the website handouts. What a great reminder of what is really important in life!
5,Mayberry is a State Of Mind,"I purchased this from a Christian Book Seller & first opened it on a flight from New England to Las Vegas. Since I had a connection I was able to read the entire book before I arrived at my destination. It really opened up an entire new perspective on how to spread the ""Gospel"". Being born & raised in the Old North State & a rabid Tarheel I am somewhat biased in my opinion of the program but not of it's enduring message of hope..faith..& morality.The book is a treasure to read if you do nothing more with it but I recommend looking into the bible study aspect it offers."
3,better in the picture,"I got this as a gift for my sister who is a chaplin nut. I wanted something that was a bit different, and not the common poster you see on every website. So when I saw this I thought it was great. When I enlarged the picture to get a better look, I saw that it looked like brush stokes. I really liked that. But when it came it really didn't look as nice, and his skin had a bluish tint. If it was for me, I would have returned it. But my sister loved it. So I guess it's not all that bad."
2,Disappointing,"I expected to really enjoy this book, but was disappointed. Some of the stories/essays were very good, but some of them were poorly written and/or could have done with some serious editing. It might have been better if some of them had been omitted: the book would probably have been half as long, but the overall quality would have been significantly improved.I was also disappointed by the way the book was laid out. It seemed jumbled and poorly conceived. Photos, illustrations and cartoons/comics were seemingly thrown in randomly, with little context or relation to the surrounding content. The graphic content of the book was good, but the layout just did not display it to full advantage.The idea behind this book was a good one, but the execution could have been a little bit better."
3,An iPod battery pack is necessary on long trips,"I was disappointed when Belkin discotinued their Tune Juice, a very small external power pack that used a regular 9 volt (smoke alarm size) battery. I assume it must not have worked with all the newer iPods.As a substitute, I bought this Maxell one. It's OK, but there are two complaints. 1) It's bigger than an iPod and with 4 AA batteries, it's considerably heavier. 2) It costs around $25.00 because it includes a really awkward collection of plastic holders, clamps, belt cilps and doodads which, for me are all totally unnecessary. You don't use a battery pack while hiking or at the gym, you use it on a plane during long flights - small and light are the important features. However, I don't see many alternatives at the moment so, I'm happy - with reservations."
4,works with G5 video ipod,"I ordered this one for traveling purpose. I have a G5 60G video ipod. I just got the backup battery pack today and noticed on the package that it was not compatible with ""G5 Video"". I called the Maxell tech support and found out it is compatible but the clip case is not compatible with G5 video. Even the manual came with the battery pack shows that G5 video is one of the ipods NOT compatible with this pack. After talking with the tech support, I opened it and tried it with my G5 60G video ipod and was relieved to find out it works. The clip on case doesn't fit with G5 60G ipod but if you don't need the case, it does work as backup battery."
1,Doesn't work with Touch 2g,"After reading the reviews i thought that this would work with my ipod touch 2g, however it is incompatiable, i tested it just to make sure for 4 hours and it didn't work. I instead went with a USB charger that works will all ipods; its made by duracell, plus you get the batteries and a car charger. Why can't all companies make products as intutive as duracell's. Here is the description for those shoppers out there, Duracell Mobile Charger CEF23DX4N."
4,iPod Backup Battery Pack,We ordered 2 of this item. We had to send one back to the manufacturer as it did not work when we received it. We have yet to hear from them nor have we received a new one to replace the first one we sent back. The one that we do have is working fine.
1,Does not work of iPod Touch,"This product does not work with the new iPod Touch. NO WAY, it maybe ok for other iPod's but do not waste your time if you have the new iPod Touch."
1,DO NOT BUY EVER!!!!!!!!!!,i bought this product and had it sent to me in Afghanastan. And it did not recharge my I Touch or any of the other guys's ipods. we had so many different ones you think it would have worked but it does not. I WOULD GIVE IT 0 STARS IF THEY WOULD LET ME> DO NOT BUY EVER!!!!!!!
2,From Maxell Support iPod Touch 4G NOT SUPPORTED!!!,"Although this unit is being sold as a P-2 2-G it is NOT. It is the older P-2. The P-2 is White. The P-2 2-G is Black. The P-2 uses AA batteries. The P-2 2-G uses AAA batteries. Maxell states both units work with iPod 4g. BUT the p-2 does NOT work with iPod Touches. From Maxell technical support: Apple changed the way their iPods handle power and older accessories such as the P-2 will not work with newer iPod Nanos and with the iPod Touch.Again, from Maxell support: P-2 2G was not actually available in the marketplace and its release had been delayed indefinitely."
4,Convenient and functional,"As a battery, it's smartly designed since you can load it up with 4 AA batteries over and over getting dozens of hours of life out of your iPod.The accessories aren't designed so well, however. Bulky, clunky, they never hired a good industrial designer. It would be cool if it operated as a stand for your iPod (very convenient when watching videos on a plane, for example).But overall, no complaints. Works great, very affordable and doesn't let you down."
5,Best back-up power source for your iPod,"If you want a really reliable, working back-up power source that was designed with total understanding of principles of iPod, buy this one.I just got mine yesturday and my iPod 3G works already for 22 hours. And it's battery indicator shows no signs of juice loss! I've tried Griffin, Macally, Power Stick - total waist of money, batteries and time. This one is a little bulky, but it is the one that will work right out of box. And it is even kind of cute with it's bright blue indicator light and glossy white surface."
2,No good with iPhone 3G!!! :(,"I get an incompatible message when I plug it into my iPhone 3G. It worked exceptional with my iPod touch though, thus the 2 stars."
5,Works with iPhone,Works with iPhone and works well.Good result with rechargeable batteries.It also shows the battery level which is also helpful.
1,Description discrepancy,"In the product description on the Amazon site, it said it is compatible with ipod mini, but when I received the product, it said that it is NOT compatible with the ipod mini. I will need to return it before I open it. I am disappointed, since I wanted to use it to take it with me when I travel."
1,don't buy it,"this is an ok product for what it does, which is power your iPod. notice I said ""power"" it does not CHARGE the iPod!!!!! this is poor labelling on Mexell's part. I would not get this, because you can get a device that not only powers, but actually charges you iPod, for less money!"
5,Don't Miss This Delightful Book,"I am an unabashed fan of Theresa Nelson. I have read and loved each of her many fine books, but I believe Ruby Electric is my favorite. Twelve-year-old Ruby is a wonderful, funny, heart-hurting character. Her first trial and error efforts at screenwriting had me laughing out loud, confirmation to me that once again, Nelson has succceeded. People need to understand that the clever format of this book, which includes big chunks written in the style of a screenplay, would not make it a good choice for a read-aloud. So what? It would be a pure shame if the cranky comments of someone who didn't understand this kept a single soul from reading such a delightful story!"
4,VERY GOOD,"It was my first time to buy a product via amazon.comAltough it is a used book,it is a clean and good ,,"
3,REFUND,I WOULD LIKE TO BE COMPLETELY REFUNDED FOR THE PRODUCT THAT I DID PURCHASE ON MAY 16th. NOW A MONTH HAS GONE AND I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY PRODUCT FROM AMAZON.com.THANK YOU !
2,expensive and not everything you need to get prepared!,"I like this book in general as the explanation's and exercises are good. But the big problem is that you need to buy lots of extra stuff to be able to use all the exercises provided in the book. There's the audio CDs you need to purchase (175$ !!!), the answer key for the exercises in the book (32$) and the book by itself. You have a total cost of (60+175+32$=267$) and then you're still preparing yourself without a class you might want to take...They should make it more eyepopping that there is no answering key and Audio CD included! (Except for the practice test which are only a few pages)"
3,The Complete Guide to the TOEFL Test: iBT Edition,"This book is new, but there is no CD in it. I receive it on time, and this price is cheaper than others."
1,?,"I can buy these all day for $50-$60, what makes it worth $200+. Did Brady wear it? Did he rub it? How much does greed suck?"
5,Pure Vibe,"Presence, Furry Freaks only begin the list of pseudonyms behind which CHARLES WEBSTER hasoperated as one of the most prolific House producer of the last decade. BORN...retains all of thevalor of previous productions, but the approach is decisively more on songwritting than beatconstruction. Sometimes R&B;, sometimes alternative, featured vocalist include Del St-Joseph,Steve Edwards and Massive Attack's Sara Jay. The rhythms are slow, the mood sultry and thevibe intoxicating. In this beautiful after-hours soundtrack, CHARLES WEBSTER makes theconnection and places heart and soul at the core of his music."
5,Best Blender You Could Ever Want,"This blender is so powerful and nice looking that you would never want to go a day without using it. Not everyone can eat 5-6 fruits and veggies everyday, it's too tedious. With this machine all you have to do is throw in some kale, yellow apples, grapes, blueberries, flax seeds, soy milk, banana and ice turn on the blender and in less than a minute, have yourself a quick and easy and delicious smoothie. Full of antioxidants and nutrition. It's so good for you. You can make hot soups, ice cream, shakes, juices, smoothies all within in seconds with this amazing machine. Once you use it, you would not want to ever be without it."
1,Overpriced,"It's ludicrous that this vendor is charging $150 over retail for the HPA3 (NOT HP3A, no such thing) that can be had at any other online store for $399. The difference between the HPA3 and the Total Blender is the inclusion of 4 programmable buttons on the left side. For all other items, you must scroll through a menu on the HPA whereas the TB has pre-programmed buttons. Both blenders are mechanically the same so it comes down to preference.Aside from this vendor's shady listing, the Blendtec joins Vita-mix as one of the top two blenders made."
1,Pass on this edition,"If you buy this edition, you better have good eyesight. Most of it is printed in 8 point size or smaller. Totally impractical."
1,Very misleading,"Not sure who this book was intended for. It is basically a dictionary of sorts, trying to define all sorts of food types and methods. Two problems come up quickly. First the definitions are very terse and of little use. Explaining stock as bones and vegetables cooked together, does little to help the reader gain understanding, and that is one of the better definitions! Secondly, many of the terms are outdated or missing. I realize how long ago Escoffier lived, but the references to items that changed their names a hundred years ago, makes finding anything very difficult, and usually completely unrewarding."
3,Not for the faint of heart,"Being a reprint of a much older work, this little tome does not come with much in the way of instructions on its use. The lists are really nothing more than thumbnail sketches of what goes into a particular dish; no proportions, no measurements, no recipes as we recognize them today. The pages contain hundreds of entries categorized by food component: pork, salmon, potatoes, suaces. A classic reference work of classic French dishes from cover to cover.For those of you curious to know what goes into making a sauce mornay or fish barbouille and aren't worried about how one actually goes about making them, then you will find this book very useful. Keep it right beside your well-used copy of Julia Child and your old French dictionary from high school."
4,A must have for Chef's,"I am a Chef specializing in French cooking and this book is a ""must have"". I could only give it 4 stars as it is not available in paperback that I could keep in my back pocket while in the kitchen."
4,Good for the professional,"This book was written for the professional. basically a book for reminding the chef what goes into the dish. it won't tel you the amounts for the ingredients like a cookbook but, wil tell you each ingredient. Itis then up to you to remember the amounts or make it up as you like."
1,Not Much Help in the Mothering Dept.,"I bought this book with the hope of being challenged and encouraged through Biblical teaching about motherhood and homemaking. Althoughthere is some Scripturally-based teaching, most of this book isthe author's very strong personal opinions about taking care ofchildren and the home. If you want to be laden with rules of how to be a slave to your husband and children, then this is the book for you! Otherwise, remember that Jesus said ""Come to meall you who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest...""Ask the Holy Spirit to impress upon your heart the areas where you need to change and become more Christ-like and be confident that He will help you be all you need to be."
3,pLaY,Play is really cool but i think the record company makes them look 2 old. Also they don't give Rosie and Anna (esp. Anna) enough lines to sing. But this DVD is pretty cool.
3,Swivel Belt Clip Holster for Motorola V710,The top clip does not fasten as well as the original from Motorola. The phone has a tendency to fall off easily.Price is cheap enough to try it.
1,Horrible,"How can you mess up a were book, put in the hands of this writer...sheesh.I dont know what book the other reviewer was reading but it could not have been this one. Harsh, maybe, but books cost too much to be taken in by a great cover or blurb. I understand the need to get massive amount of product to the public. Want a great were story, there is Christine Warren's series both in paper back and e book, Mary Janice Davidson's weres are great, R. Byrd's Bite of Magick II was hot, hot, hot, even if the main character was slow to get on with accepting his nature...lol. Try any of the authors if your personality leans toward humor, sensuality, and non conservative thinking. These books are for adults, if you have graduated from bodice rippers and heaving bossoms, you will love the suggested group of books."
4,Exciting New Paranormal,"I give it four stars.....Touch A Dark Wolf is book one in The Shadowmen series by Jennifer ST. Giles. I found it to be a riveting read, the author did an excellent job of creating a strange and exciting new paranormal world. The chemistry between the two characters was very hot and sexy but didn't in any way detract from the story."
2,If you have nothing else to read . . .,"Was hoping for a good absorbing tale to occupy my time during a commute. Instead I found myself wondering where the other precursor books to the series were since I had obviously missed them. Many unexplained references to things that had occurred in the past, one dimensional characters that behave erratically, insane and stupid one minute, brave and heroic the next. Not much rhyme or reason to it. Since there was nothing else to read I did finish it but if there had been anything else I would not have finished reading it. As I have not read any of her prior books, I was not predisposed to love it in any way."
2,Took forever to get through it,I am an avid reader of paranormal romance. I usually read a book in a day and a half. This one took 2 weeks. Did not hold my attention at all. Didn't hate it...but it just wasn't interesting enough. Don't bother spending money on it.
2,Painfully Lame!,"I looked forward to this book after reading the blurb here on Amazon. I started to read about the woman running from mysterious bad guys through the middle of nowhere. The creature that attacks her and the beautiful wolf,whom we later learn is a gorgeous fallen man/""shadowman"", who saves her and then awakens damned and nude on her car... and then the plot was done. I mean it really went nowhere!There is little to no character developement. Non-existant plot developement. A few secondary characters are thrown in with promise but are left vague and unentrancing. You never have a solid interest in seeing the couple get together. And the authors attempt at suspense is the shocking revelation that the bad guys name is actually satanic spelled backwards. I'm serious! LAME! If your new to this genre please don't start with this book!"
3,Touch a Dark Wolf,"Not as bad as some reviewers said, but I admit it does need some work. The book begins when the herione is run off the road when two wolves have it out on the hood of her car. I know, it sounds interesting, but the author mucks it up at this point. I suppose St. Giles is attempting to give her novel an epic touch by switching scenes from villian to hero to watchers. She moves from one point of view to another. A master writer can do this successfully, but St. Giles only ends up confusing the reader. I read through about six chapters before I felt I had a vague understanding to what was going on. She should have stuck with one point of view and let the reader discover what was going on along with that character. If it wouldn't have been for this confusing point of view stratagy she adapted, I think it would have been a good book. Or at least much more enjoyable."
4,A History of Prejudice and Heroism,"Throughout Mexico, one can hear of the legend of the SanPatricios, a battalion of soldiers in the U.S.-Mexico War that wasmade up almost entirely of deserters from the U.S. Army. Predominately Irish and/or Catholic, the San Patricios fought well for the Mexicans -- and they suffered for it significantly when the U.S. finally won the war.Stevens does an excellent job of telling the story of the battalion, the history behind its foundation, and the punishment its members faced after the war. Adding to the interest of the story is the role that many of those in the U.S. Army during the U.S.-Mexico War went on to play pivotal roles in the U.S. and CSA armies during the Civil War."
4,insightful,Didn't grow up learning about fasting so this book was really helpful in researching. One item I didn't agree with in the book but otherwise found it very helpful. Tony Evans tells it like he sees it which is refreshing. He's not out to win friends but to speak truth. I've also researched the health benefits (and longevity aspects) of fasting. This speaks more of the spiritual side.
5,Tony Evans Speaks Out On Fasting,"I have read a few books on Fasting, but Tony Evans' book is one I highly recommend because it presents Fasting in an easy to understand format and answers questions most believers new to Fasting may have. It's one of the best I've ever read. We carry it in our Church Bookstore and encourage our congregation to add it to their libraries."
2,Not as reliable as folks might believe,"I hate to be the sole dissenter here, but while ""Beatlesongs"" is an entertaining book to read, far too many of the ""facts"" articulated are incorrect.The author has compiled information from numerous sources, but he has relied on far too many faulty ones. The most serious problems are found in the descriptions - lauded by many readers here - of which group member performed on the songs, and which parts they played. Mr. Dowlding seems to use as a source an older, similar and terribly flawed tome from the early 80's that was riddled with errors. The great number of references to John Lennon playing ""lead guitar"" are the most striking, since that rarely occurred (""Get Back"", ""Come Together"" being definite times it did).It's a fun book, but it is far from a definitive reference source. For that, readers are urged to read ""Chronicle"" by Mark Lewisohn; that book is THE reference source for details on the recording and performing careers of the Beatles."
3,Tired of arguing over which Beatle did what?,"This will solve your problem. It's great Beatles trivia for the completist. Each song has an entry showing you who played what and who wrote what plus the Beatle's own comments on each song. You'll also find the input of friends, producers and fellow musicians. Great info on production techniques too. Some entries are shorter than others but all the major hits have excellent coverage. Good fun and cool for settling bets."
2,Don't believe everything your read,"A fun book yes. But accurate? No. There are many many flaws. For a couple of examples, it says John plays lead guitar on ""Dig a Pony"" when you can see George playing lead in the film ""Let it be"" from were the recording was made. It also states that George only played Tamboura on ""Within you, Without you"" when it's be clear for many years even by George himself that he play the simple ""Sitar"" parts on it. Did John really play lead guitar on the Let it Be version of ""One after 909"" and ""I've Got a Feeling""? A lot of real info can be found in Mark Lewisohn's book ""The Beatles Recording Sessions"". This is someone who went thru the original tapes. Anyway, I'm sure there is correct info here but I just don't know what is correct and what isn't, (unless it's obvious of course.) Maybe someone can write a book and correct all these flaws."
2,nit-pickingly flawed,"This book works much better as a COMPENDIUM of contradictory sources than as a definitive guide. Most glaringly, Billy Preston is credited with ""organ"" on Get Back, One After 909, etc., when it's obvious that only a DEAF person would be unable to hear him playing a Fender Rhodes. (Plus, I can't recall if Billy Preston played organ on ANY Beatles songs.) Sure, Mister Dowlding concedes that possibility (in very small type), but geez... Howzabout LISTENING to the SONGS maybe just once or twice...?Plus, NONE of the Christmas records is even alluded to, not even in the appendices. But really, that omission kind of fits in with the determinedly humorless tone of the book."
3,This is supposed to be in Excellent Condition?,"The book was listed in excellent condition, but when I got it I was disappointed with it. The cover was wrinkled, and it looked as if it had been well-read by it's previous owner."
3,"Useful, but not in pure size way","Got it to stock up the 32 bit operating system and with 2 channel operation. 1 + 0.5 + 1 + 0.5. 4 gigabytes would just be a wedge in the mind, that 0.75 is never used.So , as all blue Kingston DDRs2, for 8500 transfer it seems to require 533 FSB frequency. At me 533 is unattainable, so only 8000-8400 MB/s at 400 FSB Mhz. It stands on 1066 mhz itself though. Not overherzable - at 2.2 1100 already fails, 2.3 wouldn't try.Heats largely, but not worrying. They created chips for deliberate 2.2 overvoltage, so they must have tested it on high temperature."
3,Don't tape over the cheetah,"Great product, but if you tape over the cup, the fabric pulls off the backing. We ruined ours in one week. If you tape it to a foot for competition, use foam first, then tape."
4,it's definitely helped with my heel condition,I've only used it a few times for my exercise program and it's definitely helped. I developed a painful condition of my heels that run up to my ankles. This product supports the heels as well as the ankle. I just hope the product holds up to constant use.
3,Proper Sizing,"I have yet to receive mine, so I'll let you know how these work out after I've used them for a bit. I've had chronic heel/ankle pain for over 30 years, starting BEFORE my teens, so I'm a tough critic. But just to help everyone out with the sizing, what they have here on amazon is wrong. According to the manufacturer's site, if you don't want the one-size-fits-all then it has nothing to do with weight, you measure the circumference of your instep (arch):XS = up to 7.5 inchesSmall = 7.5 to 8.5 inchesMedium = 8.5 to 9.5 inchesLarge = 9.5 to 10.5 inchesXL = over 10.5 inchesMakes much more sense, huh?For what it's worth I'm trying the one size fits all because I prefer a wrap, not a compression style, but if you want it sized then that's how you do it. Good luck to everyone with easing their pain!"
2,This item only for sports use,I purchased this product for easing pain caused by my heel spur. The product shifts constantly and is not made to wear with shoes which is what I purchased it for. The cup of the heel is very thin and does not require the support i needed.
2,Plantar Fasciitis,"I was using it for plantar fasciitis. They do NOT come as a pair (one support with a gel + 1 spare gel. There is little ankle support, but this is good allowing your ankle to move.Using one caused me to limp and develop a pain in me knee on the other side.Solutions...1) use spare gel in a sock - but this isn't very stable 2) BUY TWO of these - but this doubles the cost.I did not find it any better than simple inserts bought at local pharmacy."
3,not for kids,"I was hoping it would be adjustable enough to fit my 12 y.o. daughter but it is way too big. The sized ones are very difficult to get on and off. I liked the idea of it being adjustable so it would be easy to put on/off, and for an adult it's probably great."
3,Not what I was hoping,"I received these quickly and in good shape. Comfortable. Sturdy. But, did not help with my pf or heel spur. Bought the HTP and worked much better for me. Gave this product 3 stars because it does add comfort when I am walking around the house with no shoes on."
3,"Decent, depending on how bad you plantar faciatist.","These things are pretty good. The only thing is it put a lot of pressure on the top of my foot and it hurts. Of course, mine is more severe than just arch pain."
5,The best out there!!,"My daughter is 10 years old and we have been battling an on going Heel problem, But with this boot and Oscon supplement we have gotten the upper hand finally. This boot is easy for her to get on and off with out having to have some one help her and it gives her heel the support to compete in gymnastics at level 7 and do well."
5,Helps out gymnasts,The heel cups have helped my daughter through 2 years of gymnastics without them she was in a lot of pain but tuli's heel protectors are a worthwhile purchase.
3,To small,I think the product was fine but had to return it. Even though it is an extra large it still is to small for an adult foot
1,Disappointed,"Be sure of size because you are not able to return. Customers should be told this when making purchase. I needed to exchange for a different size & couldn't. Waste of money.Tuli's Cheetah Heel Protector, One Size Fits AllI was replacing a pair my daughter already has that she uses for gymnastics. The other pair she has are not the adjustable kind & I remember having to exchange that pair. It was from a different company through Amazon & i didn't have a problem."
1,"Not a small, and not nearly as much support as it looks like it should be.","Even more disappointed in this than I am in the Mueller heel support. This is also MUCH too big for a women's size 6 and there is all this strapping & neoprene that really has nothing to do with heel support. Unless you are at least a size 8, do not waste your money !"
3,Okay alternative to a night brace,"I've been using this as alternative to a rigid night time brace. It works ok, but doesn't breath. I usually end up taking it off in the middle of the night."
3,I expected something more heavy,I got it fast. I haven't use it to know how well it works. I thought it would be a bit more sturdy. The heel cup feels like it moves sideways. I guess it's fine.. I like its adjustable
1,Tuli Cheetah-One size does NOT fit all,It was to big for my foot; I wear a size 7 womens. I tried it all different ways and it just didn't fit.
2,not true to size,"It is a good product. I know that because my daughter borrowed the heel cup from one of her teammate. The only thing, the product is not true to size. I purchase by weight of my daughter and the heel cup is too big. Very disappointed with the size."
2,Get the adjustable one.,"I ordered the small for my 75 lb. 10 year old gymnast and she couldn't get it on, yet the medium slipped off. One of the other gymnast moms suggested I get the adjustable (velcro) version, and that way she can keep it on for floor, but take it off for bars. I'm hoping that works."
2,Tuli's Cheeta Heel Protector,Ordered 2 of the same size and they were different sizes even though they were marked the same. Do not work very well. Would not purchase these again.
2,very tight,"What I ordered was not what was pictured on the website. I had read that the velcro strap ones were better. We received one w/o the velcro. (from the website, I ordered the one w/ velcro and one size fits all.) My ten yr old son has severe's disease and a heal cup was the tx the Dr ordered. The one that arrive was an extra small w/o a velcro strap. It took awhile to get it on and off. It felt good for awhile and then began to cut off his circulation. We sent it back."
1,A waste of money and it can not be returned,"There is absolutely no ankle support from this product. A sock provides more support. Be careful in purchasing this product, it cannot be returned and Amazon does not tell you this until you try to return it. The Heel cup does provide some cushion but not near as much as a gel product. I found this product to be useless."
2,Bad Buy,The heel protector will not stay in place very well. I did buy the one size fits all because I have a long but narrow foot. It is hard to get into my shoe. I really don't know how gymnasts find it protects a heel because it is not cushion very well. I would not buy the heel protector again.
4,heel fix,"I had wasted my money in other heel support, by far the best product for the cost.I would recommended for sure."
1,Gigantic for little feet,I wear a size 7.5 in women's shoes and this did not fit my foot at all. There was a huge gap between my heel and the cup. My heel really hurts and it ended up feeling worse after wearing it for a while. Definitely not one size fits all!
1,BEWARE---NON RETURNABLE,"This item is a non returnable item, even though this is NOT stated anywhere on the order page. Be absolutely positive these are exactly what you want before you order, otherwise your stuck with them and out the money!!!!"
4,Perfect for keeping coaches and spectators off the field!,"I'm using these to anchor a 3/8"" rope line about a yard off of soccer touch lines, so overly ""enthusiastic"" parents, coaches and/or players don't end up in the middle of the field. The stakes are very durable, easy to anchor, and don't pop out unless you want them to!The only suggestion I'd make would be to make the bottom of each stake just a bit pointed, so that they're easier to ""start"" in the ground, prior to using a mallet to pound them down.Other than that...perfect!!"
3,Bridget's Review,"My husband and I are both fans of animated films and the synopsis of this movie caught my eye. Futuristic science fiction has always been a favorite of ours. That being said, I was a bit disappointed with Gene-Fusion. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent movie that really reminded me of the video games my husband plays, but it didn't blow me away like I was hoping. More humor and a little more depth could have made a big difference."
4,Pretty Good Stuff,"Twin lab creatine fuel stack....contains a combination of creatine monohydrate,glutamine and taurine (basically an amino acid) hence the name STACK.The directions on the label arent as clear as some of the other twin lab products as to when and how many many you should take. It says take six (6)with a workout....so i usually split them with (3) before and (3) after my workout.Overall these are nice...but being monohydrate creatine...be warned that there is the occasional BLOAT ! ! !Strength wise...you'll see and improvment lets say 15-20% tops depending on how your body reacts to it.Give it a shot ! its a lot safer from a well known brand than most other newcomers out there"
2,This stuff killed my stomach,"I ran out of my TwinLabs Creatine Mono about a week ago, and decided to try this version, which has more supplements added to it, instead of reordering the 'plain' creatine. I've taken Creatine several times, and never experienced the bloat that other have complained about - until now. The bloat I've had for the last 5 days on this stuff is awful, and no matter how much water I drink, juice I take it with, or food I eat with it, the gas is unbearable. My flat stomach is temporarily gone and I have been spending way too much time in the bathroom. I have not been able to get a good ab work out in because of the discomfort (I usually work them really hard, but have not been able to push it as far on this stuff). I am taking the reccomended dosage, so it's not a matter of taking too much of it. I realize that this may not happen to everyone, but this stuff does not work well for me. I'll be switching to a different brand."
2,beware of creatine grade,"Have not taken creatine in quite some years now, so I forgot which grade/quality creatine is best for our bodies. First of all powder is best not tablets. Second I now read that highest or purest quality of creatine comes from Germany. A person would have to take so many tablets just to get the amount of creatine you will get by consuming the powder equivalent. Plus, poor quality creatine made in China can make the body breakout which is what happened in my case. I should have read more on the subject before making this purchase."
5,A body-builder's must have,"I began body-building at a time when Creatine was not around, and I can't imagine how much stronger I would have been (or better recovery time I would have had) if Creatine had been around. The powder form has been widely available since the 90s, but the need for a shuttle that doesn't alter/destroy the chemical make up and allows for rapid absorption was a tricky one (there is so much sugary apple juice a person can drink in a day). Thankfully, these pills address most of those issues, and the fuel stack formula creates the perfect releasing system for most people. I can still bench a full set of 350lb and recover in 72 hours (and I'm not a young guy).Some of my body-building heroes are still benching hard and heavy in their 60s, and as far as I know, Creatine is what most of them take on regular basis..."
3,Twin Labs Creatine Fuel,GNC AMP Creatine is much stronger and much cheaper and more effective. The best way to use creatine is to load for faster results and that requires atleast 20mgs a day. One should take it all day long for the first 5 days....15-20gs a day then just 5-10mgs a day before and after a workout.
1,take it and spend the rest of the day in the bathroom!!!,It does nothing but giving you bloated stomach . I didn't even feel any difference as far as recovery and anytime I took it I had to take several trip to the bathroom !!!Now its your choice.good luck.
5,A great workout recovery resource,"I've been using this product for several years, and I notice a huge difference when I'm using it, compared to when I'm not using it. Normally, after a hard workout, it takes 2-3 days to recover. When using the creatine fuel, recovery time is noticeably reduced - I literally recover overnight, and I'm ready to go the next day."
3,"Great Price, but does it work?","I've been taking Creatine Fuel from Twinlabs for quite sometime. For one it's cheap and also it comes in capsules. The latter makes it better to consume as opposed to mixing a powder with your drink - always tastes chalky to me regardless of what I do or the brand I use. However, all this being said, I don't know if it is truly helping me in my muscle recovery and build. I'll have to stop taking it to find out which I really don't want to do. So I pose the question to myself and maybe others, does it work?"
5,Awesomeness!!,"Ok, so thats not a word, BUT it should be invented for the sole use of describing this CD!!!! Ace Of Base's bubbly and catchy tune Life Is a Flower will have you singing along in no time!!! Also, they're music almost always has a happy feel to it and good rhythm. Very good production as well!! It REALLY is worth every penny!!!"
5,great product! shipped fast!,Exact fit for my tractor. all oem style wiring harness. just bold on and plug in. very simple install in less then 5 min. and works exactly as it should! thank you!
1,Worked for between 12 and 13 months,"Nice price, fit perfectly, solved problem.Lasted 31 hours according to my hour meter. Charging stops when it get warm. It was properly mounted with heat transfer compound. Battery was also new.Warranty was 12 months. Calender date from purchase was over 12 but not 13 months.Winter lay up was at least 4 months.Warranty denied. I think it has a built in timer!!!The original lasted 6 years 280 Hours. There is no problem with the Alternator or the wiring.I am a professional certified repair technician.I won't buy another one of these Chinese parts."
4,briggs voltage regulator 691185,"Bought from MOWTOWN, fast service, great price and as represented. Put it on with easy and it worked as stated."
5,Comments: The Soul Is Here For Its Own Joy,"This is a marvelous, comprehensive collection of ""spiritual"" verse from a variety of sources, covering several hundred years of writing around and about the subject. The collection reflects the care by which each verse was chosen, and some are remarkable for their wisdom and insight. It can be read front-to-back or by individual choice and one never tires of the subject -- the approach or its interpretation in the hands of Rumi, Dickinson, Whitman Rumi and much more. It is a joy for me to read, and I select from it almost daily.David Sermersheim"
5,READINGS THAT MIRROR THE SPIRITUAL JOURNEY,"Stepping Off the Edge: Learning & Living Spiritual PracticeBeautiful book, arranged like the spiritual journey: At first, you feel the call, have a big experience, make a commitment, then forget it all, do your thing in the world until you get in trouble, then commit to spirit again, forget it, go back to the world, mess up, back to spirit, etc. Until you finally really commit. Takes the reader through poetry demonstrating a deeper and deeper commitment to and knowledge of the sacred. Many traditions. Great introduction to the Indian and Middle eastern poets: Poems by Rumi, Kabir, Mirabai, Lalli, all in one volume."
5,Three lines of poetry send me into a reverie,"I chanced upon this book and now rate it as amongst the best on my bookshelf. Many poems were written so long ago (especially Rumi and Kabir) and the power and insight is amazing. That a writer (with a good translator in Coleman Barks) from 800 years ago could touch me so deeply in my spirit is truly amazing. Well, the issues of the spirit transcend time, place and religion probably. I can read 3 lines of a poem by Rumi and it can send me into a reverie for half an hour. The way he expresses his relationship to God seems to touch a deep chord that I cannot quite explain in words. There are mainly 3-4 poets in this book that I especially love and continue to return to. There are others that I hope to connect with in the future. I highly recommend this book to help you think is a deep way about your relationship to your spiritual self and to God."
5,Great Product!,"Anyone who trials with their dogs knows this is a must - I purchase this side to drape over 2 36"" crates or for use over the car, and it's plenty big enough."
2,"""highly reflective material""","As the description states, this is a ""highly reflective material"". That description didn't hit me until I opened the package. This material is so highly reflective it will blind you if you aren't careful! Bright-metalic-flashy-silver. It's the same on both sides, so not sure how it would keep anything cool or how that reflection would be soothing to an animal. I am searching for something more appropriate."
3,Good,"I always get irritations after I shave that's why I wanted to try this product! It's pretty good and helped to calm down my skin. But I kinda run out of it faster than I would like to. Also, I like PFB vanish better because of its effect as well as the application!"
2,Outdated and Dubious Stats,"Certain chapters were enjoyable, well articulated, used references that seemed credible. Other chapters, especially once he began in on the 'natural birth' topics, utterly lost me in their dubious conclusions, outdated or unreferenced 'facts'. Where for instance does he come up with the stat that only .05% of natural births have any complications? Child birth was a major cause of both neonate mortality AND maternal mortality when one looks past our modern history.We also now know that SIDS isn't caused by spanking newborns. It's unfortunate that an intelligent discussion of the over use of the cesarean procedure is mixed in with non-sensical gibberish. I strongly sense that the author is writing WAAAAYYYYY the hell out of his area of expertise through entire sections of this book. A solid NON-RecommendVince Hawkins"
2,Kirkus?,"My girlfriend is reading this book, I've only skimmed it briefly. I do detect a tendency on Pearce's part to be anti-scientific, and to make claims without giving evidence. In any case, who are the ""Kirkus"" reviewers that the other reviews lambaste? Seems odd that they are represented only by their detractors..."
3,Good music but not put together well,"I've enjoyed listening to this but I have 2 complaints that would have caused me not to buy it. One is that you have to listen to the commentary. I expected the commentary to be a separate menu selection from the actual performance. Since I only want to listen to the music straight through without commentary, this is irritating. The other is that the volume is inconsistent and jumps up. Its good music, but its feels homemade instead of like a professional production. He needs to try again."
4,So far so good...,"What an amazing book. Very well written, and down to earth ideas. Our jobs as parents are to protect, teach, and lead our children in their development. Because of the importance of this topic, we often avoid things we should be taking advantage of. This books help you find things in our everyday lives to use as lessons. I gave this book only 4 stars because I am only half way done. I am learning tons of information, and cant wait until the time is right to read the other half with our daughter who is 10. For now, we will work on planting the seeds for our discussion that will be coming as soon the opportunity arrises. Definately a book that I would suggest. If there is one topic that will shape your childs future, this one is it. Take the time, and spend the money. I couldn't think of a better investment."
2,A bit disappointing,"I was a bit disappointed with this. Justin only sang lead on 6 songs (Forever Autumn, Running Water, Blue World, Blue Guitar, Voices in the Sky and In My World). The other guys were OK, but when Justin sang backup, the songs were much better.It's not bad, but I probably wouldn't have bought this if I knew that Justin sang lead on 6 of the 14 songs.Of course it's always great to listen to Moodies music, even if it's Elevator Musak."
5,Warrior Yoga,I practice yoga on average 4 times a week mostly concentrating on Hot Yoga and this dvd wasso beautiful to add into my practice at home. It was not too challenging; however it wasbeautiful and beneficial. I could feel certain muscles the next day I normally wouldn't so I knowI was doing something good for my body. Very tranquil. I recommend.
5,Very RELAXING... Zen,I really enjoy using this video. I like the guy that leads the video. He is very calming. Good workout.. Love the music by Sting.. All around a good end to a long day!
2,Disappointed,"I love the Gaiam yoga dvds, and I love Sting & Trudie, so I was excited to find this dvd. I admit that I am disappointed in it. I did not realize that Trudie doesn't do the instruction. It's led by her teacher, who I'm sorry to say has the personality of a ball of lint. Trudie doesn't speak, so I'm wondering why she's even in the dvd? Good publicity for Gaiam, I suppose. I was quite bored by this dvd and I'm glad I only borrowed it from the library. Two positives: the music and the scenery are beautiful. If you are looking for great yoga dvds, I recommend any of the Rodney Yee ones. He's excellent."
5,Cuddl Duds lace thermal vest,"Cuddl Duds are wonderful and really do help keep you warmer in the winter. Good quality and they will last a long time if laundered carefully. I wash them inside a lingerie bag, cold water, gentle cycle, then hang them to dry. Fit seems true to size."
3,Not real sized Yoda,"This bag is cute. I love it but some wishes. The bag size is not real Yoda size. Therefore, it's little smaller for adults. The face is too much toyish."
4,Really cool Yoda backpack,this item is really useful and is cool lookin good price also compact haha may the force be with you
4,Uniquely hilarious,"I purchased this backpack to use while snowboarding as a gimmick!! It has received DOZENS of compliments, stares, and numerous requests for me to be in pictures with fellow skiers and boarders. I love it!!!"
5,Quirky gift,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my mother who is a bit quirky and whimsical and she thoroughly enjoyed it. It has not been used much, but it seemed fully functional at the time of giving. Great, clever product over all."
3,too small,"this backpack is TINY! i was going to use it for school, but it is too narrow to fit a normal sized textbook or even a notebook into! most of the size is in the stuffing. It is a fun backpack and i will probably use it to bring beer to parties or something, but i definitely expected to be able to fit at least ONE notebook inside it. maybe you could fit loose paper inside, but not a spiral bound notebook.it totally looks like yoda which is really fun, but it is so small! also it has a belly strap which could be a good or a bad thing."
1,Ugly backpack with no space,My grandma got me this backpack for my birthday. Its the most useless gift I've ever received. Even if I wanted to use it to carry my books around it wouldn't work because it has no space. Don't punish any friend or family member with a gift like this.
4,Yoda Backpack,My son loves this Yoda backpack!!! It is good quality and sturdy made. It was worth the money. he loves the life-like way it looks and it has enough space to carry his stuff in the back.
4,"Adorable, but bigger than I thought","This is a well made high quality toy/backpack. I originally saw it in a kids' toy catalog pictured on a child and didn't bother to check the dimensions. It is about 2 feet long. I bought it for my 3 year old who loves Star Wars and it is way too big for him. I need to modify the straps to even make it wearable, as adjusted all the way it is still huge. I just assumed it was smaller- again, my fault for not checking. That said, my son loves Yoda and had a fit at the mention of returning it. I recommend it for a bigger kid, as I think it will last a long time and is adorable!"
4,"If Fun for a Fan, You Must Have","I bought this novelty item for my sister, who has, over the years, collected 28 Yoda paraphernalia items prior to this one, and I must say that she has quite the Yoda shrine. She opened the gift box in front of friends and family. Her eyes instantly lit up when she saw it. Even better, she went bonkers when she realized this Yoda was actually a backpack. When you put him on your back, it resembles Yoda on Luke's back in Empire Strikes Back. In fact, everyone went bonkers and they all took Yoda for a spin.As for the product itself, could it have looked more authentic? Yeah. Could it have been of better quality? Yeah. Would I use this for heavy duty, outdoorsy, hiking and backpacking? Most definitely not. I would deem this a toy more so than for practical use.Regardless, most importantly, my sister loves him and admits that she will carry him on her back while riding town on her BMX bike."
3,Size Matters!,"The Yoda part of the back-buddy is pretty exact from a aesthetic standpoint. However the images of the zipper pocket are deceptive. Its MUCH smaller on the inside then I thought it would be. The straps are also to big to keep Yoda up on your shoulders like the images suggest. When its sized to its smallest Yoda's head sits just below my medium/large build boyfriends shoulder blades. So I cant imagine what proportion you would need to be for this to actually sit where it should... That said, its still really cool!"
4,Good series,"4 stars compared with 1 star for the old shorts of the forties and fifties.These are based on the old comic books, very close to the original comic books, in fact.4 stars because ""The best of"" includes also a few weaker episodes.Good cortoons for girls!"
4,Intriguing and Thorough,"This is a fascinating real-life adventure about an ethnobotanist (think ""Scientific Badass"") who travels to Haiti to solve the mystery of Zombis - if they really exist, how they're created, etc. He finds a culture rich in history and ritual, which he explores in great detail.My only complaint about the book is that the scientific mystery is solved fairly quickly, while the remainder of the book describes his deepening involvement in Haiti's culture. I would have at least preferred an epilogue about how the information Davis brought back was actually used in this country.But if you prefer cultural explorations with a healthy dose of adventure, you'll absolutely love this book."
5,Creepy,Something about Voodoo gives me the shivers and I found this book a little creepy. It read a little like a college book at times but it's very different. I quite liked the movie too.
4,BCUT,"I accidently bought two of these books, so I gave my good friend the other copy. Make sure to check your purchase order over before purchasing.The book is maturley exciting and very interesting as well. I am half way through it now, havent had a lot of time to read I have too many kids. Amazon is an excelent site to order from, your purchases are thouroghly sent to you! Thanks"
2,not that interesting,"I had to read this for anthro class; not that great. To me, it was borderline of fake and real, even though the guy actually went through it all"
5,A Thriller in Real Life,"Wade Davis has written a remarkable book here. Although he went to Haition a scientific assignment, the story unfolds like a novel. It is absolutely riveting, and you won't be able to put it down. The society of the voodoo culture is all here - all the mystery, the chilling accounts of becoming Zombis, the secret societies, the intrigue.Once you read this book, you will have to read his others. He has an addictive style of writing.I highly recommend ""The Serpent and the Rainbow"".May LattanzioAuthor: Waltz on the Wild Side - An Animal Lover's JournalAmazon Shorts Author - Paradise and The Last Striperhttp://maylattanzio.blogspot,com/"
5,Changes your perception,"I loved this book! Learn about plants, other cultures, secret societies, cultural ideas, and kept interested with adventurous travel. The whole concept of zombi and voudon is now completely changed in my mind, and I believe for the better. It's well written, he makes an effort to wholeheartedly embrace a culture and people who he initially knows nothing about. The characters are well described, evolving as he learns more about them. As I see it, this is a must read book that will be gracing my library shelf for many years to come. So glad I purchased it. Might I add, I never knew it was a movie til I read other folks' reviews and knew very little about this book before I got it so my views weren't tainted by any expectations. Guess now I'll watch the movie and be disappointed by Hollywood's rendition..."
3,"Hey, what do ya want for nine bucks","I purchased this cover because I needed to spend another six dollars to get the free shipping. I need a cover and figured that for nine dollars I really couldn''t go wrong. As stated in one other review there is a strong odor associated with this item. It is the same smell you get from the small pneumatic tires you find on hand trucks (furniture dollies) It is indeed a petroleum scent but it does fade with age. The cover itself is soft and relatively comfortable. It does add a bit of mass to you steering wheel, so if you don't like a fat wheel you may not like this one. It is easy to install and stays put on my Crown Victoria's steering wheel. I do wish that it came completely around to form a complete cover of the wheel. It leaves the inner circumference of the wheel uncovered. Although my wheel is rather thick to begin with. I rated it a three and will probably only use this one for the winter season. I have also ordered a thinner style for the summer use."
3,Okay but kinda smelly.,"Can't complain too much for the price. It works as advertised and fits my wheel perfectly. BUT, it has been a month now and that petroleum (gas) smell is still quite strong and lingers on your hands for a while after driving. Be aware, if you think that could be a deal breaker."
2,Too incredible to be true.....,"From reading the reviews here, I thought WOW! Maybe I'll find comfort here. I lost a daughter to suicide in March 2007, so I've been desperate for answers and I do believe in life after death....but this book is just too much of a good thing. Within 3 months of losing her son, the author claims to have had 50 or more 'communications and signs' from her son. Not only her and her husband, but most of his ex girlfriends, and even strangers keep getting signs from her son. She is constantly getting phone calls from people, son's friends and ex girlfriends, etc. saying they recieved a 'sign' from her son. And I've only read 65 pages of the book! Way, way over the top.....too many 'signs from beyond' to be true."
3,It was a bit repetitive.,It was a bit repetitive and consequently long. But it was OK. I expected a little more than what I got.
2,Review,I have prayed about this book and I do not recommend it because I believe differently then what the author does.
5,book is ensightful,i bought this book for a friend that lost a son a few years ago. she found it hellpful and spititual in nature. it was comforting for her too. i'm glad i bought this for her to get a better idea where he is now
5,History of Motion Pictures: Early Films by Thomas Alva Edison,History of Motion Pictures: Early Films by Thomas Alva Edison. I REALLY ENJOYED WATCHING THIS FILM. IT IS VERY INFORMATIVE & INTERESTING.
1,Hard for Americans to identify with.,"At first, no one can quite believe Jack Palmer has died, but they know something worse lies ahead when his heirs learn the will is not to be read until after the funeral. The bad news turns out to be the fact that Jack had another child, a firstborn lovechild born shortly after his marriage to his wife, Clattie. Suddenly, Ralph, is no longer the oldest son, and he resents it. Resentments flare as two parts of the family struggle to find the wholeness they never knew they were missing.* ""Breaking The Trust"" is told with a distinct voice that is hard for Americans to identify. Yet, the subject matter is a familiar one to any culture, the effects of death on the survivors and fractured families. Fans of Maeve Bienchy or Rosamunde Pilcher might enjoy this book. *Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews"
4,Very nice Country Rock Collection,"I purchased this several years ago in an outlet mall in North Georgia. Like all of Time Life's CDs, it is very good and has great sound. Make sure that you purchase the double CD, which has 32 tracks. You'll get several tracks each by The Byrds and Poco, along with great tracks by J.D. Souther, The Marshall Tucker Band and Mike Nesmith's ""Joanne"", which hardly gets any airplay anymore. A good buy, but remember to get the double CD."
5,An excellent book,"People who want to know what is going on in poetry these days ought to buy a copy of ""Vita Nova"" & keep it around the house. People who want to know what has always gone on in the best poetry ought to buy a copy of ""Vita Nova"" and carry it with them wherever they go."
5,Wonderful,"Even though, I'm not american i must say that this the best poetry book i've read in 1999. It's a wonderful book"
5,Excellent!,"This book provides the perfect example of how modern students can integrate their learning into an organic lifetime experience. For anyone who is interested in integrative research and theories, this book takes a bold step into the realm of education. Very highly recommended."
4,Nice sounding speaker system,Nice sounding speaker system. I have noticed that the suround is not that good but it seams to be dependent on the sound track. I ordered some HKS 9's to replace my current surround speakers. These have two midranges instead of one. I will let you know how it goes.
3,OK,i wish it was bigger but it shipped quickly and looks good!! my son loves it and it looks good in his room
4,Sharp Mind,I really like this product. It seems to work just as well as the more expensive products I have used. But I must use it every day. If I miss a day I can really tell the differance. I would recommend it to a friend.
2,Didn't affect me,"I took this product as recommended for over a month with no noticeable effects. Perhaps it has helped others, but not me."
1,NOT A GOOD PRODUCT FOR ME,"i am 44 years old. finished one bottle. sad to say, i experienced no difference at all. in short, this product didn't work in my case. i am currently taking another brand."
1,...not the best,"I have a health condition that causes me to be continually fatigued and often have difficulty concentrating, for this reason Sharp Mind is not the first product like this I have tried. While the ingredients are similar to other formulations there is something about this product that just doesn't sit right. Most of the time it just gives me a headache. I've also found it to be more expensive than other products which have worked better for me. But, everyone is different, it might work for you."
1,Didn't like it,"I tried this product for two days in a row, it gave me headaches both days and I was not able to sleep as effectively. Wouldn't reccomend it."
2,No noticable results,"Took the whole bottle (not at once LOL) and couldn't tell any difference. I won't re-order and will continue looking for something better.Several years ago I took some kind of Andrew Lessman memory pills. They worked, but were expensive, the dosage was 5 or 6 pills, and they smelled and tasted bad. I may end up going back to them."
5,Love it!!,I work nights so never getting enough sleep SharpMind does give me the extra edge I need to stay focused.
2,LACE EDGING,"The subtitle for this book should be ""A Victorian Notebook of Knited Lace Edging Patterns. With only a few exceptions the patterns are for edging only with no all over lace patterns."
3,basics only,"This is a basic book of edgings mainly, with one or two whole patterns. But if you do like some historical content of your stitches, you might really enjoy this book."
4,perfect fit,"These mirrors are a perfect fit for your 86-93 Mazda B series pickup. It is a replica in the same style as the OEM chrome upgrade mirrors. Quality is slightly less than OEM. I gave it 4 stars. The fit and style are perfect. The chrome is plastic, not metal. It looks good, but it is not very thick. For the price, I was very impressed by the product and the improvement it made to the looks of my vehicle. It functions and fits perfectly. This mirror only falls short of 5 stars in that it is a little light and thin on the plastic housing. I feel this product will function properly, look good, and last a long time, especially for the small amount of money it cost me. It is worth buying."
4,"Great big towel, but started unraveling in wash",Overall I give this product a good review. I am unsure as to the reason that the inside seams came undone in the washing/drying machine. It could have been because of something with which we washed it so I'll give the towel the benefit of the doubt. But the inside seam in the hood/head area has come apart. Very disappointing for a towel that cost $20+.Our daughter is a big girl so this was perfect. Plus it's much more plush than any other towel we purchased or were given...Great find just wish it didn't come apart!
3,"Good product, terrible return policy","Purchased the Animal hooded towel, found out after I bought it that it wasn't the best size for our baby, and called to try to return the product. They wanted to charge a restocking fee (for a towel!), and the remainder would only be given as a credit to THEIR website. The towel was good quality, though (not great)."
2,I've seen better illustrated commercials...,"Some mediocre pictures and videos of the region interlaced with ads for motels, tour operators, and restaurants. The ""guide"" section is laughable (scarce links to samesuch motels etc.) Would've made sense as a free promotional DVD but certainly not worth 15 bucks... better invest in a good guidebook or photo calendar."
5,Melodic Metal at its Best,"This album tells the story of the Silmarillion, J.R.R. Tolkien, which is the History of Middle-Earth. It has a great variety of speed, ochestral arrangements, and great vocals. If you know the story the music is all the better. Tolkien and metal seem to go hand and hand, with Blind Gaurdian in the lead. If you like bands like Iced Earth and Helloween you will enjoy this album."
4,confusion,"Just to set the record straight, The lead singer (Hansi) isn't backed up by 4 people, or a little girl, or a bunch of different people to mask his singing. He does the lead singing AND the back up vocals. He does several takes at different pitches and plays them all at the same time. Makes for a good effect. Though to add power maybe he shouldn't ALWAYS use this method.I love Iced Earth, so I picked up a copy of Demons (Iced Earth) & Wizards (Blind Guardian). That got me interested in Blind Guardian. This is the first cd of theirs that I've gotten and Demons and Wizards made me expect...well vocals that weren't drowned out by the music. That must be an aspect that Jon Must have brought to the 60% Iced Earth 40% Blind Guardian mix. All in all, after adjusting the temble or using headphone, A really good cd."
3,Disappointing,"Considering the masterpieces Blind Guardian have released in the past, this latest CD is very disappointing. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but when a band can put out shear brilliance in Imaginations From the Otherside, Somewhere Far Beyond, etc, etc, you may agree that this Tolkien thing is abit dry. Honestly, I'm not interested in someone else's rendition of a children's story. I can rent the video tape. I want Hansi and the gang to delve into themselves and write music from their heart ... not some lame adaptation of a fiction story. Blind Guardian has come a long way, and the only reason I demean them at this time is because I don't want them to continue to follow this path. It's taking them the wrong direction. They're capable of writing some of the most stunning music I've ever heard. This was not it...."
2,Blind Guardian are blind to melody with this release.,"As much as I love Blind Guardian, I cannot believe this record. This sounds like someone else wrote the album for BG. It's not a bad record, just not a Blind Guardian-type record. I must say this album is for DIE-HARD-BLIND-GUARDIAN-FANS only. I must say I was thoroughly disappointed with ""Nightfall in Middle Earth"". Concept albums are a good idea, but you have to do them well! Not like this."
1,Tolkien's Nightmare Realized,"None of Tolkien's vision is caught within, except perhaps his worst nightmare. With a band and a singer that sounds nothing more than pretentious high brow metal nerds. Yes there are metal nerds. The singing is even worse, sounding like Michael Bolton with a head cold. Tolkien's stories are just not told best through music but through words. Seriously. If as Zappa says writing about music is like dancing about architechture, then making music about books is even more useless. Didn't Rick Wakeman teach the world anything? Its not even that I don't have a stomach for metal, I do, its that I can't stand poorly executed and pretentious music in general. Can you even call this metal?Music Fan....Glad she didn't spend money on this album!"
4,Great Powermetal,"This is the most melodic album of Blind Guardian. Their music became a little bit slowlier but they won much great percussion. And they didn't lose their power. Their songs are ""bigger"" and better as before, it is the perfect way to do this kind of metal. But the bad things are the little shit between every song, I think that this does disturb, that's why I put just 4 stars on them."
4,I totally Hated this....,"until I listened to it a few times. This is a very tight, beautiful effort...Sadly, it is the Queen-like choruses that keep this CD from being perfect."
2,Not what I expected,"A bit disapointed in this, my 1st Blind Guardian album. After comparing reviews of several titles I decided Nightfall was the most lauded volume, and bought a copy. A mediocre production was immediately noticeable, with buried drums, and thin guitars. I also didn't care much for the vocals. I'd heard these guys were the new Queen, but not so. Ultimately, I simply didn't find any real hooks in the songs. It's all about the music, and you can write the most profound lyrics ever, but put it with weak music and nobody will ever want to listen. Not a bad album, but certainly not up to the hype."
3,pretty good.,"This was an above average cd but nothing to bang your head about. There are small sequences between each song so the songs themselves take up only half of the tracks to make it only 11 songs long. No doubt this is fast but just not heavy enough. If your into bands like Hammerfal,Iced Earth etc. You will love it but if you like heavier more brutal bands like Slayer,Fear Factory,Overkill etc. You should definitely look further than Powermetal."
4,"Whoa, epic midevil storytelling.","If you don't know who Blind Guardian is then this isn't the album for you. If you like metal and epic storytelling from midevil times like J.R.R. Tolkien and D&D then this is right up your alley. More of a story concept type album than a rock album like their other ones. I just discovered this type of music after being sick of american metal and its fading quality. Metallica is dead, these guys and bands like Angel Dust, Rhapsody, Kamelot and Iced Earth have taken the reigns of metal and continued on where american artists have sold out. I look forward to buying their other albums."
3,"Weak singer, great music","THe idea was great, these guys always worshipped Tolkien, so the result was this ""tribute"" album to the SIlmarillion. Amazing songs, linked in brilliant way by narrations and short tunes. But just don't tell me the singer is "" the best"". He's very weak. THe album is filled with chorus all way long and it helps to cover this fact !"
5,"Definitive Power Metal, a remarkable achievement of Music","Nightfall in Middle Earth is not just a definitive Power Metal album, it is an essential in any Metal collection. It's a shining display of rock music. It is a remarkable achievement in music period. I had listened to a few Power Metal albums before but this one blew me away, the expert use of synths and layering. The tempo-changes from a pounding haunting rhythm to an explosion of sheer Metal Madness. Every song is worth listening to, I do not envy Blind Guardian going on tour to support this and picking which songs to play, I wish they could play all of them. Each song is a new heigh in Power Metal, but I guess the best ones would be Into the Storm, Nightfall, Blood Tears, Time Stands Still (At the Iron Hill), The Eldar, and A Dark Passage."
5,"The Real Soundtrack To ""Lord of the Rings""","Given the genre, this CD really is an amazing piece of work. It combines heavy metal with J.R.R. Tolkien's world of elves, dark lords, and other mythical creatures. The vocals are absolutely ear shattering (in a good way)! The singer has one heck of a range! The guitar playing is very sold, great sound there. And the drumming is equally impressive. The songs are very long, but this a band of storytellers, and they do their craft well. I can only say I was disappointed that Peter Jackson didn't use some of their music for the ""Lord of the Rings"" soundtrack. This band certainly plays the hell out of Enya!"
3,Recon Review,"The book was ok. Lets just say there was some embellishment. I would know, I was there. I am the Marine in the front row holding the crossed M-16's. I enjoyed reading about ""OUR"" exploits but just take it with a grain of salt. I'm not saying any specific thing is untrue but I don't remember all of the things stated. Still great reading for any reader of Marine history. Still talk to those guys today. Reunion in 2011 and seeing the old guys was great. Semper Fidelis to all."
2,Disappointing,"I'm not into comics much nowdays, but I enjoy Scott McCloud'swork, so I thought I'd give the ""24 Hour Comics"" a try.I think I expected a larger format ... the art is cramped,the lettering sometimes hard to read. For my tastes, theselection includes far too much horror and/or despair.All in all, I'm disappointed in it."
3,Blessed!! Bob live,"Yes Blessed,A unique product is always a joy.I thought to find words Unpublished bob, there are many crossing his songs.so I'm disappointed can! but it is a good tool to educate youngerWe'll be forever loving Bob! the great Bob Marley!! RastafariJahLove, Franois ""sanka"""
3,3 1/2 stars.,"no great literature between the covers of this book; but that's okay: i wasn't looking for that here, anyway. just wanted some pure escapist mind-candy. and that's what i found. a quick, light read. a very fast read (you can reel it into your brain in a single evening, easily). lots of extreme violence here, too. all you sickos out there should enjoy that. i, of course, was appalled. anyway, there are a lot of william marshall books floating around in this world of ours, and the next time that i want a quick entertaining read that doesn't take itself too seriously, his work will certainly be considered."
3,Bored quick,"THis game is awesome the first 2 HOURS. Then boredom hits you. Yeah it's level based but all it is is moving to different houses, getting promoted, having kids, getting married, all the good stuff the computer version has. So basically if you have it on your computer, don't bother. If you are a big fan: 1) buy t if you have too much money. 2) RENT IT 3) just buy it and play it over again when bored.I beat the game in 2 days and wish i rented it. The 2-player games are really amusing, it could be better though."
3,Started out well,"The game started out to be a lot of fun, and quite addicting. Then, the babies start crying. This is extremely annoying! There should be a choice for being childless."
4,cool,"I love this game. iim addicted to it. i love it. i hope every one would buy it. its effects are wonderful. i just wish my friends would help me beat it but whatever. Buy it like okay, okay!!!!!!!!!!:):'("
3,the sims,ok well this game is fun it has enough things to keep you busy and its better than the pc version
3,12 year old gamer,This game was interesting in the beginning but slowly got more complicated and boring. I suggest you get the sims online I would trade all my sim games for it.
2,For the die hard sims fan,"This game was fun, but you will get sick of it after a while. If you are one of those people who LOVE the sims, this is the game for you, but if you just like the game a bit, then you should chose either the computer game or the PS2 game, but not both!"
4,I am looking forward to this game.,"I am a very picky gamer, however I really enjoy games where you manage a buisness, lifes, etc. I was a fan of The Sims for PC for quite some time, and was a loyal follower, up until ""Vacation"" then I simply got tired of it, I thought it was being blown way to far out of the water with making a completely seperate expansion pack just to add pets for example, I honestly don't see why they didn't make a patch and make it for free. Anyway back to the matter at hand, I am really looking forward to the level style gameplay (which has never been used in the sims), however I saw some screens of the game and the graphics looked a little ""wishy-washy"". This game will probably top the charts for quite a while, I would suggest that you at least rent this game, if your a fan of the sims BUY IT!"
4,"Fun, but...","I only play this at a friend's. My first ones DIED, but then I made a new game and they were doing so good but my friend killed them. Oh I'm gonna STRANGLE her! RATE THIS GAME E10!"
3,* * * * * *,"I&#146;m not going to go into the history of how this game is much like the computer version, instead at how it screwed up. I bought this game on its release date, however recently the game doesn&#146;t work right. First there is no audio coming out. Second three to four minutes into the game the entire thing locks up. Irritating when I almost completed the Get a life scenario.However, I must admit, this game is like playing with grown up Barbie&#146;s (a lot better though). We get to dress them certain ways, have families, homes, and jobs. I love this game; except for the hassle it has given me recently. It was about time that there was a girly game for Playstation 2."
2,Don't waste your time with this,"There's only one word to describe this game: EA. It's coming out on Gamecube and X-Box new and improved over the PS2 version, just like James Bond Agent Under Fire, James Bond Nightfire, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and Metal of Honor Frontline did. PS2 is my favorite system, but don't waste your time with one of EA's downgraded products for it."
4,Those wacky Sims saved my social life!,"This game is a port of the hit PC game 'The Sims' to PS2. I personally had not heard about the game until a month ago. Since I was on a university research program in northern Canada I had no access to up to date computers, and rarely had a chance to meet new people. By the time I returned to my home I had forgotten how to do simple tasks and communicate with others socially. My mother was worried about me and so my brother recomended that I play the sims on his PS2. I quickly became addicted to the wonderful life simulator. It let me live the life of a virtual person instead of my own! The sims helped me get over my social phobia and now I regularily talk to my Sims character! Soon I will be ready to go out in the world again as a reformed human being. Thanks Sims! I recomend this game to EVERYBODY, especially people who have trouble with social interaction."
1,Monotonous,"I like the roleplaying games, and thought that this would be fun, I was wrong. The sims get tired easily and they seem to always need to go to the bathroom. This game is quite boring."
4,The Sims is ok,"It's fun and all but after a while it gets kinda boring because you just do the same thing day after day after day..... If you had to choose between The Sims and The Sims Bustin' Out, I would go with The Sims Bustin' Out."
3,One storie game...,"If you played the PC game, then stick to the PC game because this should have been titled ""Sims Lite"" for PC users who own a PS2 too. On the other hand, it's a great game for anyone new to the Sims universe and may not be able or willing to invest all of the time (and expansion packs) into the Sims.Being that I think the PC version ran it's course after the release of Hot Date, this may be a good game for formerly serious Simers to use to get a quick fix now and then.The Bad:- You can't build second story homes.- Interior decorating (walls, floors, windows, doors, etc) are seriously lacking in selction.- The amount of stuff you buy to put in your home is limited to the job level you are at.- I do not like that I can't go anywhere to down-load new walls, papers, skins, etc. to add to the variety of objects in the game.The Good:- Watch your sim in beautifuly rendered 3d graphics.- Play some semi-challenging game modes.- The core game play of normal Sims mode is here."
3,I don't know..,"My sister bought The Sims for PS2 the other day, and i played it for a while. The controls are a bit confusing, and the graphics aren't great. Saving the game takes up a lot of space on the memory card, too. The characters are more interesting and much more customizable though, so that adds.. something to it. There's also a two-player mode. I didn't play much after trying to build a house for half an hour and then the game wouldn't even save. I checked the memory card after turning it off and there was still a lot of space left on it. Basically, the computer version is better and easier to use, but the PS2 version has better characters and more gameplay."
3,Buy it on PC instead,I am a huge Sims fan and could not wait for the title to be released console version even though I had some doubts. I should have listened to those doubts. Maybe the game would have been totally great for me if I hadn't already been totally spoiled by playing Sims with all the expansion packs for the past few years on PC which is absolutely way too cool for school.
2,Not so hot,"I was really excited about the game coming out for PS2, but when I got it, I was very dissapointed. It's not really like the PC game, it's somewhat confusing, and it is harder to control. It isn't a bad game, just not nearly as good as the computer version."
4,Great game,"I have had this game for 6 months and it is still fun.There are lots of jobs in this game such as Military,Robber,Daredevil,Waiter and so on.If you play this game to long it gets boring.In this game you can even build houses.This game takes up lots of memory on your memory card so make room.Over all this is a great game!!!!!!!"
4,"Fun, for a while","This game get's really boring after two weeks. I don't know why everyone likes this game! It's really anoying, I quit playing it because it gives me a head ache! It's not worth your time! If you do end up buying this buy some asprin too!"
3,Gets A Little Dull After Awhile!,This game can get very dull very quickly. I guess I am just spoiled from playing GTA3 And GTA:Vice City. You can't make an upstairs to your house and the game takes up too much space on the memory care. I think this game was rushed and should've been given perhaps to a test audience. Rent first by all means! IF YOU'RE A DIE HARD SIMS FAN YOU MAY NOT LIKE THIS GAME!
2,Not Impressed,"The ps2 version of the Sims just didn't meet my expectations. The story mode was entertaining at first but quickly became boring and repetitive. What bothered me is that there is no real plot in story mode. It's just the sim fulfilling tasks in order to move from house to house. Those tasks are almost always the same (get promoted, throw parties) with some variations. The neighborhood mode is basically the same as the computer sims game except with less relationship freedom (no same sex relationships). Overall, nothing to complain about with the graphics and the interface. I just think the game could have used more substance. If you don't care about the plot and you just want the basic Sims experience on the ps2, then this game is great."
2,this game is a waste,this game is sooo stupid because it has the worst graphics ever but there are some good qualities about this game they are that there is a cool two players games. wait correction that is the only good quality. trust me i myself own this game but 4 xboxDONT BUY BORROW RENT DONT BUY GET OURSELF frustrated some other way that does not cost money!!!
4,this game is fun but hard,this game is alot of fun when you get to do co-op but the get a life mode is way to hard. but i am up for a pretty good challenge.but this is just way to hard.
4,definitly will keep ya'll busy,"after being addicted to the sim's pc games for like 2 years, just about, i got all the expansion packs and enjoyed them all. then i got the ps2 sim's game and w-o-w. the first 3 days of having the game i didn't do any thing but play it. all of the good humor made me crack up out loud. this was a fun and entertaining game for me and obviously alot of other people. :-)"
4,I Liked it but...,"I love the Sims games, but a few things i dont like about it is you have a buying limmit, so its not as fun as the Pc game. Another thing is you cant make a two story house, only one. But i like the idea about haveing a goal on the get a life. And its easier to controll on this game once you get used to it, unless youve been playing the PC for a while. Another thing is it kinda gets boring and pointless once you pass it, so i think they should make another PC into PS2, like unleashed or vacation."
5,Awesome,"I love this game.It totally tops out the game for PC.The graphics are great and the ""Get a Life"" mode is awesome.For anyone who likes controlling other people and completing goals, I recommend this.This game offers tons of new stuff and lots of new options for your Sim.Again, I recommend this game for pretty much anyone."
3,okay,"the sims for playstation is ok, but in the regular sims you can have your house with two floors and on the playstation game you cant have more than 1 floor. The animation is okay, but could be better like the games for the computer.....i give this game about 3 1/2 stars."
5,Very fun and entertaining!,"I have never played the PC game, so I cannot quote on what the differences are, but all I know is that this is a very very cool game. It's like a Create It Yourself reality show or Big Brother: The Video Game. Its cool! That's all I can say. Check it out!!"
2,Highly Disappointing,"I was highly disappointed when I began playing this game. It lacks many of the things that made the PC game so appealing. I have the PC game and throughly enjoy it but I think Maxis struck out with this version. The controls are difficult to get used to and the game doesn't have a lot of variety. There aren't a lot of skin choices, or a lot of things to buy. However, I do like the feature that you are allowed to build and furnish a house on the lot before you move a family in. This is an option not available in the PC game. I wouldn't recommend this to any of the PC games fans for the mere fact that it just doesn't even begin to measure up."
3,ok,"This game works correctly, I think. But I had trouble getting out of the first room, it doesn't really tell you what to do either..so I am kinda stuck in one room of the house.the very first level....I haven't touched the game in months, when I purchased it.It hasn't spiked my interest enough to go back to try to figure it out yet."
1,Its Crap,"The Sims games are just crap. They are so boring. All you do is control peoples lives. All they do is go to the bathroom, sleep and stand in one spot for hours. I cant see why people like this game. Save your money and buy another game. It took me 20 minutes to get used to the controls and by then I wanted to trow it out. I never liked the sims but I thought this sims would be a ok game. I was wrong. The grafics are good but that doesnt make the game funner."
2,wha maga ho ( thats sim talk for its a bad game.),"This game is sort of stupid, the sims just mumble. Its ok wants u find out how to learn stuff. These sims are very picky. If they don't like the food they just throw it on the ground! And it takes a whole sim DAY for them to be happy! The robbers are just plain stupid! They just grab something and stand there until the cops come! If there is a fire, they just stand there and yell. If I were u folks I would choose counting how many ants there is then playin this game! Save your money and go buy a toilet cleaner instead."
1,Dont get,"IRRISISTABLE at startIt TOTALY hooks you for 2 months.Then its REALLLLLLLLLY boring(AKA) After 2 months you ""Understand it""and its not fun anymore at all, forever."
2,i hate this game,"The sims on the pc is much better this one i found out is not as much fun. When i first played the pc one i was hooked to my computer for a long time,but this one not i got bored fast and u cant do that much stuff like build two story houses and go around the neighborhood. so if u buy it have fun but i wouldn't recommend it stick with the pc one......later"
1,Plain boring,"It is quite addictive for the first 3 hours, mainly because you're learning how to use the interface.But then you realize that it is a stupid game: you're responsible of managing the lives of some people. But for this game, to live is to eat, sleep, watch TV, talk, tickle, go to the bathroom, clean... etcHas anyone really wondered what is this life for? The beauty of living cannot be represented by the minimalistic abstraction of our duties.People who find this game amusing really don't really have anything better to do with their lives."
5,OMG YOU HAVE TO GET THIS GAME!!!!,this game is the best game i ever ever saw any company make it is very affortable for what it is really like i love it and am addicted to it im about to go play it now BUY THIS GAME NOWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BYEZZZ IM TELLING YOU GET THIS GAME NOW AND ONLY NOW BEFORE THEY ALL SELL OUT IT IS THE BEST PLAYSTATION 2 GAME EVER AND THE GRAPHICS ARE AWESOME ALL SIMS GAMES ROCK EXPECIALLY THIS ONE!!!!!!!!
2,It ...,"I had my hopes up for this game. I had gotten it fo pc and it didnt work. Then i got it for ps2 and it kept getting delayed. Finaly when i got it it was pretty bad. The get a life mode stinks. Mom tells me to get a job. I try and get a job but my sims to depressed. Then I'm happy and I'm on my way out to get a job. Mom says I'm not ready yet. It went on like that for an hour until i got off and played a better game.Now for the neighborhood you can either have alot of cool stuff or a good sized house. Not both though because you can only spend 20,000 simoleons. And u never have time to throw a party. The neighborhood mode would be pretty good if you had weekends, but it's just work work work. And your sims dont listen to u most of the time. They are always to depressed, even when there fun meters half way full.Not the worst game I have played, but definitely a disappointment."
4,AWESOME!!!!,This is an awesome game a must buy it has better graphics then the pc version.Except you cant have a second floor so the house will look more like a modular home then a regular house would Get a life is awesome you have to do challenges so you can unlock better items.I know all the cheats but i dont use em.theres a monkey butler in the 1 for pc there was a robot instead this games a perfect 5 for me.
4,pro's and con's,"pro's are that its 3d, greater detail when desiging the sim but con's like in the pc version u were able to build 2 floors but in this 1 its only 1 floor. The game itself is also much darker then the pc version. Its pretty good but i expected better. ... thanks"
1,the Blue Disc of Death,"I ordered this game, when I tried to play it, it would not work in my PS2. Make sure your PS2 can read blue discs, some of the earlier PS2's can not read these cheap blue discs due to the fact that it is lighter than the normal standard PS2 dvd gold disc.Also some of the fixes to get this game to work in your PS2 does not work. I opened my playstation, moved the gears adding weight to the disc by putting tape on it. This just did not work.Alot of people are having problems with this and just make sure you PS2 can read these discs before going through the frustrations I went through. Shame on this company for printing this game on crappy discs and shame on PS2 for not fixing the problem correctly with the playstation 2 not being able to read blue discs."
3,"Good, but get the Sims for the Computer instead.","The Sims is a good game. You get to make your own people and try to run their lives so they could be happy. I suggest you get this game for your computer instead. There's so many features they left out of this game. The big one is that you can only do one level of your house instead of two levels like on the computer game. Plus, the graphics are not that good; again, better in the computer game. If you get the computer game, get The Sims Mega Deluxe Pack. That's all I have too say."
1,Really let down,"I have never played the Sims before, but when I saw that it was being released for the PS2 I had to have it!I enjoyed building the sim, but after I put her in her world, wow, how BORING. And it takes forever to do anything. Do you know anyone who takes an hour and a half going to the bathroom? Or eating breakfast? I think they should have made the timing on this game a bit more realistic. I don't know, I sort of felt like I was babysitting the whole time.Maybe I wouldn't have been so disappointed if I hadn't expected so much more from this game. If you're thinking of buying it, stop - get the PC version."
1,Huge disappointment,"I'm sorry, but this game can not compete with the PC version(s). The 3-D graphics lose a lot of their coolness by being so dark and indistinct. I agree with the reviewer who said that you couldn't zoom in close enough to get a good look at the graphics. The unique features (Get-a-Life mode, two-player mode, etc.) don't compensate for the un-user friendly Buy and Build functions. Being a devoted Sims fan, I expected more. Either rent it first or buy it used. It's not worth the [$]."
2,Not faithful at all to the Original Sims.,"I bought this game as soon as it came out, as I'm addicted to the computer Sims. It's nothing like the original Sims. The basic premise is the same, but the controls are horrible! One of the best parts of the game is to build your own house for your Sims. No matter how I tried it, I couldn't get it to happen. I would recommend avoiding this game at all costs. There's a good reason why so many people are selling this game in the Amazon.Com marketplace."
1,To hard,This is WAY different then the PC version. It was to hard to see the sims close up and it was too slow. If you are used to the PC version don't buy this.
4,YAWN! Sims disappoints!,"The biggest problem with the Sims is it makes me want to quit playing to clean my room, take a shower, and talk to friends in real life instead of via my Sim characters. Games are supposed to take you some place else, not copy your daily routine. I'm a big SimCity fan, but I'll pass on the video equivalent of playing doll house!"
2,Disappointed,"Just like so many other people, I am a big fan of the Sims on the PC. I have been anxiously waiting for the PS2 version. I got it Friday night, and quite frankly am disappointed.If, like me, you have all of the expansion packs and mastered a long time ago how to manage your sims time and achieve your goals, the get a life mode will be kind of annoying. Imagine going back to the first game and starting from scratch. No vacation, no shopping, no pets. The graphics are good - but not THAT much better.There are a few different things, obviously, but if you've been playing a while, you really are going back to that first starter house, without the cool options the expansion packs gave you."
1,This Game is STUPID!!!,"Im friends wit a EA Ceo and i pre tested the game and it was so stupid just to enter ur house it takes like 5 minutes do not get this game it is just a big waste of mulah (money)belive me i have all the sims expansion packs and this one is sllower than 1 on the slowest computer/ MAC. This game is for pooples you cant do anything u could in any of the expansions. so just dont get this game!!!I no i put this game as a 1 star but it is not it would not let me put 0 stars.A awsome video gamer,wouldnt u like to no"

5,BEST GAME ON PS2,"The sims is an awesome game!Its way better than the computer version because it has way better graphics and you can play with two players.like the one were you compete against each other to steal as much food as you can from the people at the park.And you can buy a monkey butler that does whatever you tell him to.You have to unlock certain items so at the menu screen hold L2,L1,R1,R2 to bring up a cheat screen and enter MIDAS.That will make all the items unlocked.And to make everything free enter FREEALL.Everyone who has played the sims on computer and have a ps2 go buy The sims on ps2 cause its way better than the computer version."
5,THE SIMS FOR PS2 RULES,"This is a great game that is soooo much fun. a lot of people though have been having trouple with the game i did at first xause i put the game into the ps2 and it said ""disc read error"" to fix this i soon learned that you need to put the ps2 on it's vertical position, after i did this the game worked perfectly. I've been playing it none-stop i love it. Parents I suggest you buy this for your kids if there a sim's fan, they will love you for"
3,The Sims,I like the Sims games. I just don't like the time it seems you can never get anything done and continue to stay happy. Other than that it is a fun and time consuming game.
5,Delivery,"Well I must say that I'm very pleased, the shipment came within the day that my PS2 did, the video game read perfectly."
4,ROLLERCOASTER IS AWESOME!,"i love the song ""Rollercoaster"" by B*Witched, in fact, i think it is their best song yet! Its catchy tune makes you wanna get up and dance! As for the person above me in amman, jordan, i used to live there......and the peeps have great taste! No lies- especially if u went to ACS!Though ""C'est la Vie"" can get a little annoying, "" Rollercoaster"" had me listening to it over and over. i recomend it to peeps who like hip hop."
5,A POETIC SWEEP OF HISTORY and THE COSMOS,"Hugh Seidman's poetry is rich with scientific understanding and a knowledge of the sweep of history and the cosmos. He is more deserving of recognition than many poets of our time who have received more. His is a quiet and sparse voice, not redundant with words, but musical with economic expression, sometimes elliptical, but always ultimately accessible when one follows his intelligence to where it leads us on ""the other side of the poem."" He takes us to where mystery exists in reality. There is nothing soft-headed or occult herein, but the blunt reality of our lives as we seem like aliens trapped on earth and ruling it, often poorly, with greed, obsession, and fallacy. Seidman is worth reading, and his work will make you want to be that somebody who stands up and sings. This is a poet of truth and conscience, who thinks deeply and sings intelligently, one with whom we can share our wounded and struggling humanity."
5,Do NOT go to Tokyo without it!,"This map is without doubt the most comprehensive map of Tokyo ever made. It lists every single ward, cho, and chome in the city (though sometimes the numbers are really hard to read). Using it, I was able to find everything I was looking for in the city, with no problems. It folds up really well (once you ditch the index) so you can put it in your pocket. It's easy to write on, and reasonably durable."
4,"Trip-Hop pre-Y2k, beat generation","The soundtrack and film seem at odds and are really two different animals. However, makes sense in a coming of age theme. Guys road movie that has a nice universal appear, lots of different characters surviving on the planet. The swamp scenes with gator guide and the silver guy are my favorite. The lost tourist who just ignore the camera's dumb question is dope as well. I think the film is better on the whole then the soundtrack. I love those artists though, just one those kind of spotty hip-hop comps. Overall got for a deal and I'm happy. If your about 30 something and takes you back to that 90's hip-hop life for us caucasian persuasian kids living west coast style. Good for the whole fam. Thought you knew."
2,Montana Slim,"I recently rated this one from an email link, do not need to repeat, as you should already have it."
5,Musicians With the Worst Teeth?,"...most distinctive noses, unsightly ears? Probably something you wouldn't read in too many other books (any?) A great book to have out on your coffee table-- the bored guest at your party will be most grateful. And it will definitely provoke discussion, as well as some good laughs. ALOT of interesting trivia-- behind the scenes facts and things that really surprise you. Things the musicians would rather not have you knowing about them. Definitely a fun and engaging read!"
2,A Trivial Pursuit,"I admire the author's attempt to catalog some of the bands that were playing during that period. In fact, one could make the argument that this period of time WAS ""a"" sweet spot in rock and roll history. However, this book is flawed in that his facts aren't always correct and the endless meaningless trivia gets old. When it comes to the Beatles, his reviews are outright ridiculous, although everybody has an opinion. His own editorial comments are at times odd. I guess one of my favorites was when he thinks Peter Noone (Herman of the Hermits) is comparing himself to Jimi Hendrix when it was obvious that all Noone was doing is paying homage to the guitar hero by saying his band's time had come and gone. I couldn't finish the book."
2,Poor in content rich in images..,"I was looking forward to reading this book but was disappointed when finished with it especially since it's written by Zaha's right-hand design partner and office director. I expected it to be a description of Zaha Hadid's design process, the move from manual to digital design and the techniques used to create form and design buildings. One rather gets long empty characterizations of the poetics of form and Zaha's move from deconstructive to organic shapes.It's full of many nice images though if that's what you're looking for. To sum up, this book is good only as a brochure.."
5,Women in Shadow and Light: Journey from Abuse to Healing,"The photos were what first drew me to the book. Once I started reading the stories of these courageous women I could not put the book aside. As a survivor I connected with the women, with their stories and found the book to truly be one about hope and healing. It is a must read for any abuse survivor or anyone who cares about or has a survivor in their life."
5,A Page-Turner!,"I really enjoyed Schreiber's 3rd book in his Ironwood County books, and I thought it combined the best of the first 2 books. It had the mystery of Passing Through Paradise, and it had the thoughtful stuggles of the narrator in Hillcrest Journal. Life on the Fly also really kept me reading! The plot twists were interesting, the dynamic characters were easy to identify with, and the themes of forgiveness & discovery were very powerful. Schreiber's easy writing style and thought-provoking ideas make him a truly gifted author! I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an exciting and insightful read."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is one of the worst travel videos I have viewd, both in terms of content and quality of production. If you're going to Florence, the best way to prepare is to read the National Geographic Guide to Florence and Tuscany, a real gem that thoroughly descibes this most beautiful of cities."
2,OK if you like sour almond syrup,"I bought this product, remembering the sweet almond taste of the Orzata beverage. To my surprise, the sour taste of the added citric acid was strong enough to make the overall flavor tart instead of sweet. Compare the ingredients in Ferrara Almond Orzatata Syrup to the ingredients of Monin Almond Syrup, and the difference is obvious.Ferrara: sugar, water, almond extract, citric acid, artificial color, 1/10th of 1% sodium benzoate(as preservative)Monin: Pure cane sugar, water, natural almond flavorI rest my case."
5,Orzata,"If you like almonds, you'll love this syrup. I discover new food uses for it regularly and am frequently pleasantly surprised."
5,An Absolute Classic,"Every track on this CD is very good or better and most are better. The music was recorded when Cannonball had expanded his group to a sextette by adding Yusef Lateef. The group made the most of their size by adopting a big band sound with horns playing figures under the soloist. Jive Samba is a classic and listening to Jessica's Day, you can feel the band swinging off the bandstand. Cannonball made many good CD's but this is absolutely the one I would start with."
5,Excellent product,Port & Company Finger Tip TowelI am so pleased with the purchase ... very happy with the finger tip towels and pleased with the order turn-around time.
5,"Finally, Clean Windows","After trying many ""solutions"" to dirty windows on Hilton Head Island ... think pollen and salt spray ... this kit just works! I now have floor to ceiling clean, non-streaked windows. Ettore rocks!"
1,Sized wrong!,"Disappointing but the shoes, which were fantastic, were too big. I've been wearing Etienne Aigner for years, so I know my size. I thought maybe they were misprinted, so I returned them and tried again. Same problem. But gret service returning though!"
5,Great,"Focusing on some of the best works of Thomas Alva Edison.This film encompasses his later work in his dying days, rather than the beginning of his career in the late 1800's.Truly a dedicated man, hope everyone enjoys as much as I did.Does anyone know if the others are good?Thanks for the fast shipping!"
3,Good,"This cd is pretty good. I love how some of the artists remade the songs into their own, like Jane Child with ""We Dont Need Anoher Hero"" & Kyle. McMahon with ""I Dont Want To Fight"". Kyle.'s solo version is far superior to the one here & you can find it on the net. Rose Riter just sang over Kyle.'s version of the song. Ashame as she doesn't really have the ""chutzpah"" to sing a song like this.I also like the remade version of Private Dancer.THe other songs just sound like the original versions."
3,"Tiffany, Jane Child and Jasy Andrews rocks on this CD!","I bought this CD because of Tiffany. I just lover her voice. Think she did a great job covering ""what's love got to do with it?"" Her voice is amazing. But i think they could have produced it differently. She should have done ""Thunderdome"", i think she would have done it very good.But Jane Child does it very good too, and i liked the cover of this track it is different but with same force as the original.And Jasy Andrews cover of ""Private Dancer"" is beautiful. She made it to a ballad, with herself playing piano while she is singing.The rest of the songs is good as well.Except Nancy Kerrigan, trying to sing and cover ""The Best"".She really stink as a singer and should stick to figure skating.but the CD is good over all..."
2,Only a couple of good remakes on this stinker!,"I bought this CD as I love Tina, but was disappointed with most of the songs. The best remake was by TIFFANY. Who would ever think? She nailed it down like a pro, and being a Tina fan. TIFFANY ROCKED!!!!! Thank goodness for that, as the rest are stinkos! Denice Williams was good and I thought Nancys voice wasn't a good choice for The Best, but with the right material, she can sing. The rest are garbage!Its worth buying for the Tiffany song tho!"
2,a mediocre album with a few good songs...,"A tribute album to Tina Turner....she certainly deserves it. The problem is, that if you cover Tina Turner, it will always sound weak compared to the original. This is why this album only works when the songs are given a complete different arrangement. I Loved the new version of ""Private Dancer""(sounds like Tori Amos) and ""Silent Wings"" is also great. The other tracks on the cd sound mostly like cheap karaoke versions, instead of a professional recording. I do not regret buying the cd because of the 2 songs I mentioned above, but overall not a very memorable album."
3,Disappointed,I thought the book on the Flexitarian diet was quite good. This additional cookbook that I purchased with it was quite a disappointment.
4,"A ""flexatarian"" primer","Kornelds cookbook may just give the vasilating vegetarian reason to introduce omnivour, back into their vocabulary. Not only does she move from appetizer to desserts, she frequently allows the option of meat or vegan alternative in many of her recipes. I enjoyed her recomendations of courses that go well together and found her resource suggestions for hard to find pantry items most helpful. While all of the recipes I have sampled were well worth the time, they may not be practical for the working chef with a busy schedule. It is , however, a must for those of us who continue to attempt to please the various palates of those we enjoy cooking for."
3,Too Many Unusual Ingredients,"For anyone who lives in a small town, this book would be practically unusable. There are just too many ingredients that would only be found in bigger cities."
4,Good Recipes,I have only tried the veggie chili recipe so far. It was so yummy. Cant wait to try other recipes.
4,McAleese is indeed No Mean Soldier,"This book is an interesting account of a soldier who has been involved in actual combat for almost 20 years of his life.This career has spanned the British Airborne and Special Forces, Rhodesian and South African Special Forces and as a Mercernary in Africa and South America.The book itself is a very good read, and conveys much of the reality of modern battle, and also much of it's humour. It's the tragedy that comes through most strongly though, especially in the breakup of Rhodesia, which is still troubled now, over 20 years later, and Callan's massacure of his own troops.It's certainly a page turner, and I finished the book wondering, ""What will he do next?""Bryn"
4,Neko puts it down.,"Neko Case's sultry, reverb laden vocals are the soundtrack to some wonderfully echo driven dreamworld. I am fairly new to Ms. Case's music, but this album certainly delights and draws the listener in."
4,"Haunting music, and lyrics to soothe the night.",Ms.Case's album is a superb companion to the night's lonely airs.
5,Don't Miss It!,"Great CD, either for attentive listening or as background music while working. With shades of Janis Joplin and Grace Slick, Case's lyrics are penetrating, and her style bespeaks road-wise experience and an earthy grace. For someone who looks to be so young, she writes like she's been around. She has a great career in front of her. Don't miss out on this one."
4,Very cool album.,"If you don't believe me, just put on Deep Red Bells. It's the coolest, most terrifying song I have possibly ever heard. DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP RED BELLS!!!"
4,reverb,This cd is really growing on me but the high level of reverb on her voice throughout the disc can be real distracting.
2,Where Have All The Good Songs Gone?,"Blacklisted is an uncomfortable sounding release that contains a few exquisite numbers (Stinging Velvet, Deep Red Bells) but gets bogged down by a lot uninteresting songs with dreary accompaniment, suprising considering the 'top shelf' musicians involved. Never have Joey Burns and John Convertino sounded so ordinary.After the entertaining, high-energy Virginian and Furnace Room Lullabye, perhaps it was time for a change of direction. Unfortunately, this terrain has been covered by many artists to greater effect. Check out Kelly Hogan, Mary Gauthier, Giant Sand's Chore Of Enchantment, and even Calexico--all do this sort of noirish-atmospheric thing much better.Neko's pitch problems are not nearly as noticeable here as on previous releases however, but she still tends to oversing her way through a song."
2,Lady Pilot Down,"Neko Case is lovely and talented. ""Blacklisted"" does not showcase this. This, like lots of recent pop records that get good reviews because there isn't anything better, is a record of songs that are the bases of good ideas. It's like a sketchbook that we get to look at. The songs end before they get cooking, and none really allows Ms. Case's powerful, firey voice to melt your heart. Pick up ""Furnace Room Lullaby,"" which was easily one of the best records of 2000 to hear Ms. Case at her finest. ""Blacklisted"" gets two stars because it is, to be sure, better than anything you'll hear on the radio but far below what it could have been."
4,deep red bells,"neko case is a beautiful singer with a beatiful voice. she isn't exactly country, but more of a balladeer with folky roots. of course, there is lots of reverb and steel guit, heavy on steamy emotion and lust. she touches country just enough so that you know where is coming from, as well as adding something new and modern. think slow love making."
1,over-rate me,"Imagine if your career was based around a myth of ""keeping it real"" by doing something that was done to death before. If Patsy Cline could get away with skanky clothes and brag about picking up guys by asking them to massage her southern regions, well, there would be no need for boring Neko to exist - if Shania is Britney then Neko must be Christina, long live mediocrity."
3,Disappointing...,"This book is a good book, the problem is, is that is aimed at non-technical people. As a programmer, I was expecting a much more thorough review of the registry, in particular, the hardware section. The book does not touch on the Registry API functions enough, and assumes readers will make registry operations with windows (control panel etc..). For hardcore readers, Windows SDK and DDK provide much more thorough (albeit difficult) answers."
3,"""Maizomeno""","The sound quality is great, the highlights of this album are the instrumentals: ""Pororocas"", ""Frutificar"" and ""Yesterday"". On this album we have some of the weakest songs from A Cor do Som. Frutificar (1979)/Live at Montreaux Jazz Festival (1978) is much better the two LPs in a single CD, it could easily be found in any Brazilian site."
5,this game rules,"take it from me...This is one of the best games I have ever played in my life. Period. This is one of those games that is just plain fun. Many games, like James Bond, is very unrealilistic because you don't sneak around that much, you kill everyone you see and you can carry unlimited weapons. Tom Clancey is a stickler for reality so he and Ubi Soft have made one kick but game."
3,"Played it, then wondered what the big deal is...","No...I never did feel like Sam Fisher. The Graphics are some of the best I have seen, but graphics alone don't make a great game. I feel like I must be insane because I don't like it as well as 90% of the players, but this game is SO LINEAR it makes me sick. I would have loved to be able to go into all the doors it wouldn't let me in, and have the chance to actually figure things out myself. They may as well have left red arrows flashing to get you to the end quicker. I love stealth games, but a much better game was the old ""Thief: The Dark Project"" Made in 1998...Huge dissappointment. The game isn't half bad, its just that it is not all it was made out to be. Hats off to all you fans, but if you want multiplayer, or the option of thinking, look elsewhere. Buy thief, it is much better..."
1,Another Clancy Game?,All I have to say about this game is that they need to STOP IT OR I'LL BURRY THEM ALIVE IN A BOX!!!
1,More like Boring Cell,"People will say whatever companies want them to, but not me. What the companies don't want you to hear about Splinter Cell is it's horrible story line, it's lack of options, and the atari style graphics that fill this game. I am a computer gamer, I play more games than anyone and I know games better. Trust me."
1,"WAIT, READ THIS FIRST----BORING...Good Night","This game has NOTHING in common with other Clancy games. Personally I do not care for the game at all. Having read the other reviews regarding this game, I was under the impression that they were similar in that you were part of a team trying to catch the bad guy. I enjoy shooting and blowing stuff up. This game is about one individual who has to sneek around, while trying to be extreamly quite, to complete his objective. This is fine if you DO NOT enjoy destroying things within a game. Buy this game for it's graphics, level of difficulty, and to enjoy a ""sneaky"" good time. However, please do not think that this is anything like Rouge Spear or Rainbow Six, it is not. All in all, I wish I could get my money back. This type of play just is not for me. I'm sure though that some will really have a great time being quite."
4,Splinter cell,Splinter Cell is a game in its own unique class. It is the only game I have seen that is a realistic stealth game based in the near future. I first rented this game got stuck and gave up. A few weeks later I picked it up at Best Buy. I beat the part I was stuck at and went on to fall in love with this game.You are Sam Fisher. An Elite member of the 3rd Echelon that uses stealth and ingenuity to overcome obstacles to complete his missions. You are battling the middle east and even the US in this game.
2,Dancer's Worst Nightmare?,"Imagine that you're a dancer cast as the lead in a high-production ballet. Just go with me here. It's been meticulously choreographed, everyone's in costume, the scenery and props are all in place.Now imagine you missed every rehearsal. You don't know where to stand, you keep missing your cue, and the director is constantly yelling ""cut!"" because you've [fouled] up the scene so many times. The other actors have to repeat their lines ad nauseum, waiting for you to get it right.You've just played Splinter Cell."
4,Talk about suspenseful,"I only rate it 4 stars because I expected a bit more action, but I realize that is probably my fault for not investigating more on the game, I mean, the description does say ""Stealth Action Redefined"" *sigh*, anyway, The game is good, the weapons are simple, the missions though, wow, they're a freaking spiderweb, you can pretty much take 2 or 3 different routes to complete mission, which is hard at first. I had to play it a couple of times on easy to get it, hehehehehe. I mean that whole make-a-wrong-move-and-set-off-the-alarm deal all throughout the game, dang! Had me by the seat of my pants!If you like stealth, this game is it, If you like all out shoot-em-all-dead games, then no, get something else. =)"
5,Another Clancy Classic,"From its fluid controls to its intersting story line you will be loving this game from start to finish if... You like stealth games. If you want to run arround shooting mindlessly (ala Halo) you will probably find this game frustrating. There are plenty of satisfying moments when you get to shoot people in the head, but other missions force you to refrain from killing. This game has great graphics, great level design, and best of all is fun to play. The only problem i can find with it is that if you don't hide a body well or some such mistake it can set an alarm off later on in the mission (presumabley when the body is found). The hard part is knowing why the alarm is sounding and you are failing the mission. That is a minor flaw though, and can be avoided by cleaning up your messes."
1,Not what I thought it would be.,"As a fan of stealth games like the Thief series, I thought Splinter Cell would be fun, but its not. In Splinter Cell you have absolutely no freedom. All the great moves and gadgets the game claims to offer never really come into play. You cant just up and repel of a wall if you want to. You can only do it as part of a heavily scripted sequence, and only at the designated wall in the designated location. Kinda takes the fun out of it. Also when you sneak up behind someone, you have to get close enough for some bizzare antiquated menu to drop down, and then you select the appropriate action. I should not need to go through all that nonsense just to hit someone. The game was boring. It was simplistic and required no thought or strategy.If you want stealth action check out any of the Thief offerings, Splinter Cell was a major let down, in my oppinion."
5,Invisible Gardens is both scholarly and pugilistic!,"""Marijuana prohibition has ruined countless productive lives, clogged our justice system, overcrowded prisons and wasted countless taxpayer dollars. The purpose of this book is to foil the efforts of the authorities by using my method of gardening,"" writes Robert Bunch.And what a method it is. Whether or not you use the author's tips for keeping marijuana and mushrooms covert, this book is extremely entertaining. With wit and humor, Bunch relates where to put your stash in the backyard, treetops, house, auto, or airport, how to grow a mushroom garden, and even how to adopt a puppy and train him to be your drug-sniffing co-conspirator. The final chapter is a cookbook-Tres Trip Dip, Soup a la Psilocybin, and so on. Packed with anecdotes and hundreds of inventive tips, this oversized volume is the perfect gift for any friend who is sick and tired of the drug war.Eye Magazine October/November 1998"
2,Disappointment,Disappointing. Glossy pictures of unoriginal designs. Many selected plants would not survive in limited interior lighting.
2,not what it could be,"I can't really recommend this book for gardeners of any skill level. It's too basic for advanced gardeners, but not detailed or concrete enough in instructions for beginners. Some of the advice is just plain wrong, the instructions are repetitious, and most of the designs are uninspired. It might work as a coffee table book--if the photos were better. Some people may find some inspiration here, so I can't say it's totally without merit, but it won't find a place on my permanent bookshelf."
4,Cats will be cats,"This little gem of a children's book addresses the sometimes difficult relationships between parents and children with a dark humor that is hard to ignore. I have owned my copy of this book for years, and it has enough complexity to provide new meaning each time I read it. I have always found Piper Paw's world somewhat grim--perhaps the smudgey, black and white illustrations have something to do with this. His relationship with his parents, teachers and schoolmates is so antagonistic that I begin to wonder what made him so incapable of love--this of course is a conclusion I have reached recently, and not when I first read the book as a pre-teen. But Piper comes around at the end, if not completely, at least to a level of compromise that he can live with, which includes no kissing. Because of Piper's antics and some of the more bizarre illustrations, I would recommend this book for kids 9 years and older."
5,A Very Special Album,"It doesn't matter that Johnny is gay, he still helped woo my girlfriend who isnow my wife of thirty years! Thank you J man!"
1,I'm Coming Home...Johnny Mathis,I couldn't believe how POOR the quality was. I can barely hear it throughout most of the tape. How could he say this was sellable?
3,Excellent advice for a registered sex offender,"Harry Lewis Martin, Jr. has shown us all that you can actually get away with child molestation. He's gone as far as to prove that -- if you're sneaky enough -- you can rape children in many states.I'm sure it's harder to write a book when you're pretending to be blind."
5,"Masterful, Insightful, Makes A Difference","I have read a lot of spiritual books which are so full of mumbo jumbo you can hardly understand them and cannot figure out any way to use what you read. Harry Martin has cut through all the rhetoric and presented a straightforward course on how to make a difference in yourself and the world about you. I hope this is just the first in a series, because this is a book anyone can learn from. The information is practical and can be used to make life better."
4,Intriguing story line,"I found this book to start out slow, but than gained momenteum. I found myself thinking about it when I wasn't reading it and regreting when I had to put it down. It really brought my into it."
5,Greastest book ever,listen up kids and grown ups if you like to take test for your children on the book they have read buy this book not only does it give you the questions it also gives you the answers test your knowledge and buy this book from amazon.com first and the look for book on this book to buy also on amazon.com and read it and take the tests to see if you really understood the book you read.Good Luck
3,A subjective critic,"Impressive at first, but I use to get bored at the second listenning. Technicaly, there isn't any sign of weekness, guitar and keyboard are impressive. SilverLake and Somewhere in dream are my favorite songs. But I get bored of the voice of Elisa (too much acute). If you like that type of music, i would recommend to look at Rhapsody."
2,Not very elementary,"I bought this book because it said it was ""elementary."" I was taking a college level statistics course and I thought it would be helpful to get a high school level text. My thinking was that this text would explain concepts in more clear and basic terms. Actually, my college text was easier to understand."
2,Dissapointed,"I was so excited to skin my new T Mobile Sidekick 3. The skin came with very poor, non specific directions. I followed the directions exactly, but the product would not peel, as one piece, off of the backing, like it stated it would. Some of the design actually transferred to the sticky paper and left white sratch marks on my Sidekick skin! I was dissapointed already. The coloring of the skin, which appears to be wood grain from far away, but up close is appears to have a greenish tint, and look more like flames. The adhesive properties of the skin were very good, hovever, a few corners did peel up and ruin. The skin design rubbed away from using my trackball, the design is not very durable. I would not reccoment this product."
4,"Finally, 5.1 surround in Vista using optical out","I was in need of a sound card that would give me 5.1 Dolby Digital Live on the cheap, to work in Vista through my sound system (digital optical input only). I wanted to use this for true surround sound playing the recent crop of Games for Windows and my on-board sound would only ouput 2.1 PCM audio to my speakers. I am happy to report that this card has solved my problem. Bioshock is wonderful with separated channels. I used the drivers that Vista automatically found online and haven't had a problem yet. Would be nice if this card support EAX 5.0, but EAX 2.0 is good enough."
5,Creative Payback is a beach,"I clean installed Vista Ultimate..all was cool except my sound..the infamous x speaker icon. Downloaded all the web solutions to get my SB Live 5.1 going but no ""compatiblity""...The reviews here said this card will work so i bought one...put the card in..blew out all my dust..tried to install the drivers from the CD..""incompatible..what!.."" went back and checked the reviews..oic..the CD does not work...let Vista find the drivers...did that...and my Rhaposody is sounding better than ever...SO YES from my experience THIS CARD WORKS WITH VISTA!...yeah there are a few weird messages and stuff if u try to install the software..but hey...my promise of never buying a creative sound card again was met...payback is a beach as thet say. Hasta la Vista Creative."
3,Ok,"Pretty average card, didn't notice anything big, tried the optical out surround and it didn't have true surround. it didn't change the sound at all so it didn't work. but otherwise good card for anything else."
4,Great cost and great sound,This was a great sound card for the money. Took me a little while to figure out how to install it but after I did the optical audio works great for only $35!
4,Finally a decent CD presentation.,"Loved this album in the '70s and the first CD issue was awful. Now, ten years later, the newest remaster of this disc is way better. Only complaint---""Midnight Cowboy Medley"" still sounds bad."
4,"More Like ""Why Classics are Important""","Having just taken a humanities course that helped to increase my understanding of the importance of Classic Western art, architecture, literature, and philosophy, I picked up ""Classics: A Very Short Introduction."" Having read it, I now have an increased understanding of the importance of Classic Western art, architecture, literature, and philosophy.(See what I did there?)All kidding aside, it really isn't the primer on classics I expected it to be. Instead, it focuses on such things as early archaeologists' trips to Athens and the Temple of Bassae, and how (and why) classics have been taught over the years.It's not great, but for the ratio of educational value:hours reading:cost, it's pretty good. ""Classics"" may not have turned out to be what I had expected, but it nurtured a growing academic interest of mine. And that's never a bad thing."
4,Works but hums,It works like its supposed to. Easy hook up woth the DVD player Hums every now and then through the speakers but seems to stop when you turn it off and then back on.
4,Pictures,"Needs more pictures, especially the Morgan Dollar. Left it out completely which is absurd, considering it is probably the most widely collected U.S coin. Still, it is very usefull when used in conjunction with another book, like the 2006 Black Book. It is also a 2004 Edition, so the prices are not up to speed, hence using two books."
3,Uninspired and not too useable,"Information in this book is adequate, but nothing very interesting or inspiring. The overall setup makes the information very hard to use, and there is no sense of the overall horoscope pattern."
2,It's okay,"I was disappointed that the purple bunny was not a bright purple like in the photo. For a moment I even thought it may have been used, but I'm sure it was brand new. The purple bunny head is a sort of minky fabric that didn't look good. I thought it would be cotton like the rest of the towel. The bunny head section is very soft, but the color was a real disappointment. It's barely purple. Maybe I'd call it amethyst, but it's not a fun, pretty, purple. The quality is satisfactory. The towel section is not as plush as I expected. Overall I was nonplussed with my purchase."
5,"Good book, needs a better title!","Easy Millions is an inspirational book with hard facts on making money in the stock market. Abraham Wilson talks about his own experience in business, and explains how a company gets started, gets listed on a stock exchange and of course how-to profit from moves in stock prices.I certainly recommend this book to online investors. The book is actually 152 pages."
2,Gardens of the moon,"My first book by this author.Maybe it's because I have a poor memory for names, and this book has way too many characters, but I didn't like it overall.It left me confused most of time as to what was going on."
5,Interesting cast of characters,"this is the first book in the series and I enjoyed it. The number of characters introduced is large, but once you get past that the book is great."
5,At Long Last...,"I've been waiting, hoping, looking, for a book by Nita Engle for many years. Her work always brings joy to my heart. Without doubt my favorite watercolorist. Thank you, Nita!"
3,misleading title,"The artist does beautiful work and I'm sure her techniques are helpful and inspiring to more advanced watercolorists. However, for a beginner such as myself, this book is little help. There are many examples of Ms. Engle's work, but very few step by step photos to illustrate the text. The author should have realized that we beginners are not in a workshop to actually see the techniques of which she is writing and that detailed photos would be necessary for us. The title gives the impression that a beginner could follow along. My suggestions: a change of title or more detailed step by step photos. I'll keep my copy in the hope that someday I'll have enough of the basics down for me to use this."
3,Interesting But,"This book is interesting but not sure it is useful for everyone. If you like to paint free and loose then this book will certainly help you. However, if you want more control even in the spontaneous effects of certain techniques this might not be for you. I find more and more my style is a bit more controlled and though I want to be more spontaneous I often am not happy with what results from some of these techniques. I think you need to know what kind of a painter you prefer to be before buying this book. If you are open to happy little accidents and going with the flow, no pun intended, then I think you would enjoy this book. Beautiful artwork and helpful demonstrations. I think some of you will be very happy with this book but for those of you are more methodical in your approach I think you might be disappointed."
5,Awesome!!!!,"I have only been working with watercolor for about 2 months and bought this book for some information to help improve my work. WOW! What inspiraton from a book! I was so excited to try some of the techniques with my painting and have been having a blast doing it! I don't expect to achieve the excellence of this artist-author, but using this book really makes it exciting. I am nearly 60 years old and using some of the techniques described in this book makes me feel like a kid in school. My paintings show promise, and since I have only been using the book for a week I am looking forward to continuing to explore the potential of this fascinating medium."
1,This is not the book for serious artists.,I was disappointed in this book. The art and techniques illustrated are of the type one might expect to see on a TV Craft Show. I would instead recomment Robert Wade's watercolor book.
5,A must have book for Watercolour painting,This book is very practical and it is great that an artist is prepared to share her own learning experience with others who are learning about water colour painting. The book had lots of examples and practical learning experiences so that by the end the painting really does start to paint itself!
5,refreshingly Inspiring!,As soon as I got this book I couldnt stop reading it and then running to my art table and trying out the techniques. They gave my watercolors a new approach and fresh look. This is definitely one of my favorite books.
2,"Too arts 'n crafts for me,,,, I returned it today","I just did not like this book. Maybe I'm not experienced enough (I'd say I'm an intermediate watercolorist perhaps)to appreciate her approaches to achieve this or that. After reading all the reviews, I ignored the nay sayers and bought it. It go returned today. I thoroughly looked through the book and I just KNOW I am not going to be pouring paint on a page, then whatever happens, I'll make a painting from it. It felt like taking a craft class. Just IMO here. I do appauld her efforts."
5,Great for expanding your watercolor techniques,Book was suggested by an instructor who had taken many workshops with Nita Engle. Great suggestion!! I have tried many of these non conventional techniques and I find it challenging and inspirational.
4,Interesting Watercolor Techniques,"This is an advance level book with interesting techniques, however, I feel there are earsier ways of accomplishing similar results and a lot less messy. Our watercolor class will continue working within this book for a while longer, as we are always interested in trying different methods in a search to find our own individual voices."
1,broken,I recieved this product broken into 5 pieces. This happened over a month ago and the company that sent it (Unbeatable Sales) does not want to refund my money. I paid over $100 for this item and and it is worthless to me. I am very unsatisfied with the service that I am recieving and do not recommend purchasing anything through them.
5,Must have! Healing music.,"I first heard this CD while getting my flu shot this fall. I have to lie down to get any kind of shot, and even still I'm seconds away from fainting. But Camie's harp music was lulling me into tranquility, despite the nurse and the needle in the room.After surviving the innoculation, I went to the hopsital gift shop (St. Louis, Forest Park Hospital, and purchased the CD. I intend to play it for patients and let their spirits soak in the tranquility. I plan to buy her other CD's available here on Amazon.com."
5,This is scary!,"Adam and his friends found out that there was a doorway to the past that opened. Now there are powerful creatures in Spooksville. One rhinocerous even injuried Adam. Quick, They have to talk to Ann Templeton to get rid of these creatures."
1,Update your listing,Please update your website. Its misleading. This item has been out of stock for quite a while. Quit wasting our time............
4,Recorded live in Philadelphia supported by bunch of teenage girls,"First of all, they sound pretty good live. As for this CD, it kind of reminded me of Dashboard's Unplugged CD. Most of the audience sounds like teenage girls as whenever the band performed their hit songs, you hear the high pitch screaming in the background, and they sing along word for word. If you are a hardcore Fray fan, you might enjoy some of the tracks where Slade talks to the audience. On one, he starts out, ""It's a poem that I wrote as a small child...."""
3,eh....,"I think they sound great live, and it really shows off their talent, but i hated the screaming teeny-boppers singing along, they should have recorded this in a studio"
5,excellent gift for young Yankee fan,The Thurman Munson T-Shirt was a birthday for my grandson. He is a big New York Yankee fan and loved the shirt. It has been laundered many times and is still in good enough condition to be handed down to his brother. It has not faded and if it ever does it would be just as cherished.
3,Udderly Adorable Cow Costume for Dog,"The costume is as titled ""Udderly Adorable,"" but not without its issues. The headpiece worked better as a toy than as part of the costume. When I took the costume out of the package, my dogs immediately grabbed it and took off. When my dog wore the costume, the head ended up under his chin. As my dog is a Boston Terrier mix, with a very cow-like face, the head piece was ""udderly"" unnecessary. The legs were likewise unnecessary (for my dog) and he did mouth/play with them at times, too, but everyone who saw him seemed to like the legs. He got lots of attention and admiration wearing the costume."
1,No Longer made,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00084UXVY/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis link shows the image shown on the Amazon website for the American Standard Certaherm R540 Rough Valve Body. This configuration was installed in one of my bathrooms but, it never worked well and, recently you weren't able to shut off the water completely. Here's the problem-this configuration of the valve has not been made since the 1990's and can't be found anywhere. The valve I received, a complete redesign, looked nothing like this but, HAS THE SAME EXACT NAME. This I did not know until I received my order from Amazon and called my plumber with the sad news. Guess what? Yes, in order to install the new configuration where the old one sat, the plumbing, wall structure, and all the tile had to be re-done. Do you think it would have been helpful to know this BEFORE placing your order? I think so.Amazon needs to update their website with correct picture."
3,"this is a good option, but there remains one much better..","I believe this to be the first release of the Brilliant Classics complete survey of the works of Bach on 160 CDs. This isn't a bad deal on its own, but pales by comparison to the re-release of this anthology in a 155 CD package, for less than half the price. That is the one to have, and worth an unqualified recommendation at that extremely modest cost."
2,Stand barely fits,"I would not recommend this mobile base. The planer stand barely fits, the legs are 1/2"" off of the base. Also there is no way provided to attach the stand to the base. It would seem to me that this base is made for a different application, or the engineer that designed it never attempted to put the stand in the base. At a price of nearly $100.00 I expected a much better fit. Personally I would recommend puchasing a universal base at around $50.00 and making it fit. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because it is well constructed."
2,"Too Thin, Too Smelly !!","I like the design of the attachment points and the artwork and that is about it. It is still smelling up my bathroom several weeks after installation!! The vinyl is so thin and light weight that the air movement created by a hot shower has it fluttering all over the shower and me! A longer, heavier curtain with some sort of weight at the corners would solve that problem but not the incredibly strong petroleum smell..."
3,Kept Falling Off the Rod,"This is my 2nd hookless shower curtain. Loved the first one, this one however, keeps falling off the rod at one end. I'm hoping it is just a defective curtain. I'll probably give it another try."
4,A rosy memoir,"This is the second half of the memoir of Peter Sheridan's family life--the secret life of his father and the ""other"" woman in his parents' life together. After his father's death, he becomes acquainted with this ""other"" woman and rounds out the story of his family's life started in his previous memoir ""44: Dublin Made Me"". Although I read in them in the reverse order without too much difficulty, I would suggest reading ""44:Dublin Made Me"" first. Enjoyed them both, and recommend each of them."
4,Great sound!,"I've got most of DT's lps and wanted to branch out a bit so I checked out Symp X. This lp was at my local record shop so I picked it up. Great production on this thing, my meaty system just absorbs this thing like a sponge. I love all the instruments sounds and the arrangements. Very nice sound these guys have. I am not a big metal fan but I do dig this complex, symphonic metal stuff and Symp X delivers! I only give 4 stars due to the singer. He's very good, I may just need to get used to him and maybe all of these type bands have that stereotypical metal-like over the top singer, but I guess it just goes with the territory. It's the instrumental music on this cd I like the most. All in all very good. By the way, I have only listened to it about 3 times and I literally heard my first notes from this band 7 days ago."
2,Not Wim's best,"This may be Mertens' worst record. It's unfortunate that he has moved in this direction. The ensemble pieces sound too often like ""adult contemporary instrumental"" or ""New Age"" and that is embarrasing for Wim. For those who have heard Mertens' earlier records and liked them, beware!"
5,helping with grief,"After loosing my husband to cancer, someone gave me this book.It helped me because it gives one simple thought per day. When working through grief, one cannot handle lots of thoughts and ideas everyday.I found I could take on the one thought given each day, live with it, and keep moving. One thought, one day at a time. I bought copies for my grown daughters and a friend who recently lost her father."
5,Review for Healing after loss,"Someone gave me this book after I lost my 13 year old to cancer. What I love about this book is each page gives you something to think about or ponder. As you read each page, you will either be moved by what is said, or not. If it resonates with you, you can stop and ponder what has been said. If one particular page is meaningless,you just continue to read on until something else hits home with you.It is hard to concentrate when you are grieving, so having a page a day to read and think about is a very good place to start. ....I have purchased this book several times now for other bereaved parents and for a friend who lost her husband... another who lost a sister....I highly recommend it!"
4,A Prayer for Comfort,"Having a particularly difficult day, I prayed to God for comfort and I unexpectedly received this book as a gift from a friend a day later. My concentration is impaired and the very short reflections of those who have suffered loss is helping me gradually recover. I brought a copy for my son as he travels his own path to healing."
5,Great gift for anyone who is in the grieving process,"I recently sent this book to a friend who had just lost her father, in lieu of sending flowers or a card.She told me that this book has helped her immensley and was much appreciated."
2,This is OK for small readings,"The book is exactly what it says: daily meditations, so the entries are short and meant to be that way."
1,Ripped off,I am very unhappy with the entire experience and will buy my books locally from now on. I could not track the shipment and then was notified that it was returned to sender with a hefty postage and restock fee charged to me!!! Buyer beware will be my motto!!
1,This is not a Christian book,I bought this book because one of the bad reviews said it was a Christian book. It does have a few mediocre references to the bible as well as many humanistic ideas. There is not any great biblical truth that will give someone purpose in the Christian life and lead someone to a closer walk with God. Anyone from other religions would get the same kind of comfort.
5,Healing After Loss - Daily Meditations for Working through Grief,"This has been a great book. My husband passed away, and I was given this book by my minister. It was wonderful!!! I attended support group meetings for grief, and recommended it to everyone in attendance. When suffering from a loss, one can only deal with a little reading, and one page a day worked well. I still recommend this book, and have given it as a gift to people dealing with grief. Thank you. Nancy"
5,Daily Dose of Comfort during Loss and Grief,"After my husband died suddenly at the age of 58, a dear friend gave me this book because she had lost her significant other less than a year earlier and someone had given her the book. I read it faithfully for the first year of mourning after his death - the last thing I did before falling asleep each night was to read the daily entry in this book. I was always comforted and amazingly the daily words were always applicable to where I was on my journey through tragic grief. I have now given this book to everyone in my social circle who experiences a loss by death, and will continue to do that. It is a comfort and a blessing to know you are not alone on this journey."
5,Amazing,"I found this book right after my young son died in 4/07. I had received many books from friends regarding grief, comfort, ect. I have read this book so many times, the binding has fallen apart. There are times that I do not read this book for weeks. But when I do read it, it amazes me how pertinent the reading is. I now give this book to any of my family and friends who are experiencing loss and share the title with caregivers through my work."
5,Such understanding,"Having lost my husband almost 3 years ago, I was given this book by a friend. It spoke to all the emotions,thoughts and actions I was experiencing. I knew I wasn't really going crazy!It was so helpful in dealing with his death one day at a time that I now give a copy to any friend or relative who has lost someone."
1,Not very good.,This book was not for me. It was little inspirational words and written alot like a desk calendar. Not recommended.
5,Healing after loss,I received many books after the death of my husband but ths one is by far the very best. It is beautifully written and very helpful to the bereaved no matter he or she happens to be on the journey of grief recovery. I lead a bevreavement group and give a copy of this book to our members and also to other persons who are suffering a loss. Very worhtwhile.
5,An invaluable source of comfort and wisdom,"I feel so blessed to have stumbled across this little gem. Martha Hickman has such a gift with words. Through her own personal experience of losing a child, she has been able to paint the confusing and painful terrain of suffering that many of us experience when we lose a child. I have lost two children recently. During times of profound sadness this book has been my anchor.I carry this little book everywhere with me in my handbag. It is the bible for the non-religious."
5,Very Helpful,We received this book as a gift when we lost our daughter and short daily readings/meditation was very helpful since some days all one can do is just a little reading. I have since purchased this book others.
5,excellent resource,"I bought this book on the recommendation of my sister. I bought it for a neighbor and I bought a copy for myself. My neighbor lost her daughter to suicide and my Mom recently died from cancer. I can not recommend this book enough for anyone that has lost a loved one. How comforting it is know that others have walked this same path and truly know what it is like. The short daily message is about all one can read initially- then I found myself reading ahead. It brings me comfort and perspective. It is bringing me healing.I got a very warm thank you note from my neighbor. I do not know her, but knew of her tragic loss. This book is not from any particular agenda other than loss of a loved one. It is appropriate for all of us that lost a loved one."
5,Great resource for grief,I work as a bereavement counselor. This is one of the best volumes of daily meditations I've come across. I suggest it to most of my clients and they say it speaks to their hearts. Wonderful book! Very real yet comforting.
5,Healing After Loss is a healing book,"Great book---Short varied segments that offer real help and hope to those who are going through the grieving process. Spiritual rather than overtly religious, making it appropriate for many people. The short format makes it easy to read and digest, as it is often difficult to concentrate on longer works when grieving."
5,"comforting, short daily quotes, passages, and summary","I didn't expect a grieving book to be so comforting...just like I didn't expect my Dad to die suddenly of a heart attack at 58. My Mom and I found this book and bought it for everyone in our family. It is amazing how the topics are similar to what you are recently feeling. I read out loud to my Dad in the morning to give me energy and to keep him close. (Ladies - do this *before* you put on makeup.) Our family will talk about a daily quote and how we relate to them. It helps sharing our stories and feelings through this pit in your heart time.Unfortunately, due to their sudden loss, I have given this to family friends. But they have told me it has helped. My Mom gave it to her pastor and to the rescue chaplan so they can pass it onto others in need. This book can help you through this unthinkable time."
5,Hospice perspective,I was provided this book years ago after the loss of a child and found it very helpful. I donate several every year for use in our hospice grief group.
5,Healing After Loss book very helpful to widows,"I first found this book 3 years ago when I lost my husband, I have since purchased over a dozen copies to give to friends and relatives who have suffered losses of spouses."
5,Healing After Loss,written in the form of daily thoughts..an understanding of the pain of losing a loved one and a realistic idea of what it involves. Would be helpful for those who have come upon a sorrow in other forms as well.
5,Great Comfort found in this little book~!,A MUST EAD for anyone experiencing a loss of a loved one by death. I have a copy available to give to others when they have a loss.
5,Superb. A Real Help For a Real Need,"Of everything I've read to learn about grief, and how to cope, this is one of my two favorites. This one is presented as a daily devotional, with quotes and thoughts for each day. I find it very helpful. This book really speaks to me. The daily entries are brief, but they are thought provoking, insightful, and give me validation and a better understanding of what I'm going through. I've never been a fan of psycho-babble or counselor-jargon. This book is not like that. It is a pleasure to read. And that's what makes it special. A grieving person is already in pain. He needs to see some light, to have some hope for a better day. This book offers both."
4,Healing After Loss,"This is a good daily quote and passage reminder that there is a way out of the grieving after a signigicant loss. I find myself reading ahead of the date on the page. Each loss is different, and each loss is experienced differently by each indiviual, and this book addresses such a variety of needs."
5,A great little book.,This daily meditation book is thoughtful and very supportive. I highly recommend it for people in the healing process. It is a kind and sensitive book that supports the grieving process in a very special way.
5,Recommended,Been reading daily since the death of my mom in Dec. Somethings pages I really identify with and others not so much. Best daily book I've found for my liking out there and I've researched them.
2,must be new,"this must be a new author. The storyline is good but it is choppy, too narative and not focused very well. Good for a beginner though, maybe she'll get better with the next one."
2,Quickly produced and quickly forgotten,"This book was written hastily to cash in on the publicity surrounding FLT. It qualifies as something of a scam, since the author not only has no expertise in the area, but the book itself has little to do with the actual proof. It consists mainly of simple explanations of basic mathematical methods and traditional math problems. The book's short length is padded by extensive quotes from other books. For a much better book on the same topic, I recommend ""Fermat's Enigma"" by Simon Singh."
1,The World's Most Infamous Math Book,"I've mentioned to my brother that this book (in my own field of number theory, alas!) may be the worst popular book on a mathematical topic ever written. His response was to buy it for me as a Christmas present.If you are a mathematician or at all knowledgeable about mathematics, you will probably respond in one of the following three ways:(1) Laugh(2) Throw up(3) Laugh until you throw upIf you are a number theorist and actually know what a semistable elliptic curve is, it only gets better-or worse, depending on your point of view. Is Marilyn vos Savant the World's Stupidest Person? Considering that she undoubtedly made a tidy sum for her minimal efforts in writing this book, I am forced to doubt it. Will you be a candidate for the World's Stupidest Person if you buy this book? Only if you take it seriously."
1,Stuporous funker!,"I say, I like to consider myself somewhat of a cosmopolitan and, as such, delight in the undertaking of a novel or tale of interest... but the self-proclaimed 'Savant' of mathematics has gone too far! This infernal, bug-addled, mephitic clodhopping ninny has committed the following insults:1.) Inscribing her picture near Fermat's on the front cover, implying by the most subtle of means that she dares rival one of the world's greatest mathematicians.2.) Claiming to have found several errors with (not only Andrew Wiles' proof, but) mathematics in generalHowever, I may mention that despite the fact this book induced me to vomit with rage, I still retain a copy to convince my associates that IQ is completely unrelated to intelligence. I am still in disbelief that the publishers can live with themselves, knowing that they are spreading ANTI-information; bring this book in too close contact with an actual book on mathematics, and both will vaporize instantly."
1,Waist of time and money,"The author, whom I understand is considered smart, don't know the first thing about the number theory. The description of the events that led to solving the problem in question are lacking accuracy and substance."
1,Not Bright,"I expected much more from someone who is supposed to be intelligent. This book was not so bright. A knee-jerk reaction to a very-long-term problem that was nearly solved, fixed a problem or two, then resolved to an even higher level. No wonder the author is now a five cent critic. The problems have been resolved, no thanks to the author."
1,What a purported high IQ will not do for you:,"It you will not write you a good book on math. I was browsing through the store, and randomly opened to a page, where she says something about proving that imaginary numbers are a sham based on a proof by contradiction. She based her argument on the following statement: -1 times -1 = 1, so by contradiction, imaginary numbers do not exist.Ahem. If you're interested in this book, I assume you, like me, passed junior high algebra and could care less that (-1)(-1)=1, and care more that imaginary numbers are of the form ix, where i=sqrt(-1). How does her statement prove her argument? I don't know. Why'd she write this book? I don't know. Will you buy it? For the love of god, I hope not."
1,One star because I can't give zero...,"Marilyn should have quit while she was ahead (with the Monty Hall problem). If I were the person with the highest IQ in the world, I would have made sure that I understood at least the rudiments of mathematics and logic before writing a book about them."
2,"Long proofs are bad. Short books, too.","This little book offers an anecdotal overview of Fermat's last theorem and Wiles's proof. The total commentary about these two subjects is insignificant. At best this book offers a brief intro to mathematical thought, proofs, and history, though none of these things haven't been written about countless times before. Armed with a subscription to Scientific America and a couple of basic math or logic books from the library, it seems one would have equivalent references to those used in the making of this book. Thats all."
3,very complicated,"As a student researching a report for school on Fermat's Last Theorem, I came into this book with a math background of Calculus and a relatively good average in math. It took me over three weeks and a great deal of cross referencing with other math textbooks to understand some of the ""simple"" concepts written about by Ms. Vos Savant. To tell you the truth, I believe the reason I had to do so much outside studying was because the author did not sufficiently understand the topics to explain them correctly. Recommended only for those with a driving interest in math, an advanced degree, or those with ALOT of disposable time on their hands."
3,Little boring,"I have searched all the Web for the Wiles' proof on the Fermat's Last Theorem, but never found that. This book is nice only for that"
2,Not recommended for gaining an understanding of the proof.,The book talks more about the pitfalls inherent in mathematical proofs than about Wiles' proof of FLT. Reader agrees with the points made in the book.
4,Lively British Swashbuckler,"""Secret of Monte Cristo"" (or ""Treasure of..."" as it was titled in the UK) is no classic of the swashbuckling genre, but it's been a favourite adventure film of mine since childhood. There's plenty of action (enthusiastically of not too competently staged), some gorgeous Italian locations and a pleasant cast giving its all. On the minus side, the print is in very poor condition, badly scratched and faded; it is however presented in its full widescreen ratio, which makes a welcome change after years of pan and scan TV showings. The steep prices on these Warner Archive DVDs might put some people off, but if you're a swashbuckling fan like me, Warner's latest batch of costume pictures is likely to prove to tempting to resist."
1,"Promising title, no deliverance.","I am on page 19 and I simply had to quit. Ms. Stapinski was lucky to know some interesting characters, however, all these interesting people leave you emotionless and empty. The idiosyncrasies of her relatives are fed to the reader peace meal, and there is no coherence to her story. A far cry from the likes of Frank McCourt. Shame on you Newark Sunday Star-Ledger to compare the two as equal."
3,"Strong start, disappointing follow-through","The first half of this memoir was absolutely delightful. I've never been to Jersey City, but couldn't turn the pages fast enough as Ms. Stapinski recounted story after story of her colorful brood of relatives. She obviously researched her family history well and delves into their ups and downs with a perfect mix of regret and humor.Unfortunately, she runs out of family anecdotes far too early in the book and, halfway through, shifts gears into a whiny autobiography. She appears to think that she is the only twentysomething who has ever gone through the angst of finding her place in the world. The book drags on and on as she feels the need to expound on a litany of real or imagined social ills, exposing her own self-importance and arrogance.The first 12 chapters are a wonderful read, but don't bother with the rest."
2,Misses the mark,"Writing about unattractive people in an unattractive place can be a springboard for terrific writing, but Ms. Stapinski's ""Five Finger Discount"" misses the mark. The writing is pedestrian, and the author expresses not the slightest affection or compassion for her subjects. Her attitude is straightforward: Jersey City is not good, and all the people in it are not good. OK, but where can you go once this point has been driven home? ""Five Finger Discount"" doesn't go much of anywhere."
2,About one third of the way thru this book...,"I started wondering why I was reading it. My family is more interesting than hers. If you like to wallow in dysfunctional family behavior, petty thievery, and people acting like jerks... this is the book for you. People who think this is a great read need to get out more often."
3,"An enjoyable, non-taxing read","I am not a huge fan of memoirs but I found Helene Stapinski's family history to be an interesting and well-organized read of life in Jersey City, as she and her family lived it. I am surprised at other reviewiers taking offense to her descriptions of her hometown and her views - while I found Ms. Stapinski to be opinionated, I also found that she did an excellent job of maintaining an emotional distance from the ""story"". I enjoyed peering into this life, with its stolen luxuries and potential for destruction - I don't imagine that this memoir is much different than what many others remember, or are experiencing now. While the book is not very cheerful, it is an honest and poignant view of a memorable childhood. I recommend Five Finger Discout for both its historical interest and its unique ability to draw the reader into the world of petty crime and abuse and for its understanding of family dynamics and loyalties. Not everyone grew up in Mayberry!"
4,What a family !,"Helene Stapinskis story of her Polish immigrant family is a real eye-opener into the way of life of a New Jersey family of crooks. Tony Soprano eat your heart out ! Almost without exception, the males in the family are either in jail, going to jail or coming out of jail and are into every lurk and perk possible.The boys in the extended family have no hope from childhood, growing up in a depressed neighbourhood amongst ugliness in the old buildings and deserted factories. Getting food and ""swag that fell off the back of trucks""is a way of life and conditions them to thinking that stealing is ok if you're not caught, right from childhood. I found it an interesting read as it exposed a world totally foreign to me and almost nonchalantly recorded the chicanery of the local political systems. It could have been a very depressing story except for the way that she describes the strength and weaknesses of the women of the family who hold the whole structure together."
3,Jersey City crime family,"Stapinski escaped a Polish-Italian American legacy of petty crime and violence when she fled to college in Manhattan and a career in journalism, but she never entirely escaped her roots in Jersey City, a smelly city in the age of urban deterioration. This salty account of her growing up years across the river from New York joins the ranks of other memoir, coming-of-age tales that are so popular right now."
3,A Good Read but Depressing at Times,A good read and an insight into a different culture. It was depressing at times but I finished the book. Enjoyed it and glad the author shared her story.
4,Many games in one,"I love it!There are many ways to play this game, including multi-player, which makes this game a must have. The graphics are very clear and the precision of the driving is great--you don't crash around every corner. However, hitting your opponents three times fast is very difficult, but you can just slow down and wait for them to go around again if you like to have a nice scenic bike ride.There is Wild Race, where you race against three other bikers and a cop. In Cop Patrol, you're the cop and have to knock down all four bikers. Time Attack lets you race without opponents against a clock (very difficult). I haven't figured out Survival mode yet because it requires a password and my first password for Wild Race doesn't work on it. Multi-player lets up to two players connect (I haven't done this). Finally, there is a tips section that gives clues as to the gameplay. It's fairly simple but tons of fun, and the variations just make it a bonus on bonus."
2,Another port from Destination (yawn).,"Well, yet another popular title is trying to get ported to the Game Boy Advance. The problem is, a Game Boy Advance can never live up to the visuals set by the Playstation. The lack of buttons means control is missing. Even worse, it runs on the same engine as the disastrous SMUGGLER'S RUN port a few months ago! EA made a solid port of this to the Game Boy Color three years ago, but they actually put effort into it. Do not buy this title. If you need some violence on motorcycles, buy GTA: VICE CITY for PS2. If you need a driving game on Game Boy Advance, get Colin McRae Rally 2.0."
4,Insightful!,"Don't look here for flowery prose; this is an academic accounting of the modern history of Afghanistan and the origins of the Taliban movement. In a flood of chronological detail, Michael Griffin traces the political evolution (or devolution) of the country from the 1973 fall of King Zahir Shah, through Soviet occupation and horrifying civil war, to the birth and victory of the Taliban. Playing a central role in this history is Osama Bin Laden, whose presence in Afghanistan severely muddied an already bleak environment. Griffin is even-handed in his analysis - misogynistic Taliban, expansionist Pakistanis and disingenuous U.S. administrations all receive sharp criticism. We [...] strongly recommend this clear-headed history of a now critical region to all readers."
5,REVEALING,"Not being as grammatically proficient as some of the other reviewists, I can only add my observation.While being a difficult book to read, not easy flowing as in a novel, the subject of this book is so well researched and packed with facts, that slower reading is required to assimilate all the info.To me Afghanistan has always been a vague cauldron of politics.Michael Griffin's book has opened this 'mystery' of politics by explaining in detail the interaction of all neighboring countries, especially Pakistan who plays a leading role in the politics of the area and the Taliban.Very informative reading. If you are interested in politics read it, if not read Harry Potter.Highly recomended, most intelligent book I've read in a decade."
4,A good overview on how the Taliban came to power.,"This was written before 9/11. It is the story of how the Taliban came ot power in Afghanistan. It shows the culpability of Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and finally the United States and how their actions resulted in the rise of the Taliban. I think the US had less to worry about with the coming of the Taliban, but they had a role. Pakistan created this monster with money from the Saudis. Massoud, and the other guerrillas rivalry also created an atmosphere of lawlessness.This is a detailed read on the old regime in Afghanistan. It is a must read to understand the nature of the conflict."
2,It's only good to use with hot tools.,"I really want a product to tame the frizzy hair, I thought this product would make it and I was totally wrong. If you are a person who always use hot tools to tame the frizz, and style your hair, then this is a good product for you. I have curly hair, very frizzy, but I really want something to help me with the frizz without the need of hot tools, I don't like to use them, my hair is already dry and coarse, so this product is not even close to what I was looking for. I should saved that money and buy again Hair Milk from Carol's Daughter, that's the product that really makes my day in a humid day, this experience would teach me to don't look for something new, when the old stuff works perfectly fine. I won't buy it again."
4,Anti-Frizz Spray the Best!,I had been able to purchase this product at a local retail store. But recently I found out that it isn't in the places that I normally go.So I did some research and found it on Amazon!I was glad to be able to stock up and get a few at a time!This product is amazing! It gives your hair such a sleek and smooth look immediately when you spray it on.It doesn't leave any residue or make your hair look oily!And it has a wonderful scent!
1,Haven't recieved product and can't get response from seller!,"I purchased a product on 01/02/12 and also selected 1 to 3 shipping (which cost me $10), but the seller tells me that it's my fault for not checking in earlier. Excuse me, I thought I would give it a day or two before contacting the seller before complaining....so somehow this is all my fault. I took my bad review off the first time thinking since the seller seemed serious and would make sure I would get my product by Tuesday 01/10, well guess what, it's Thursday and still haven't recieved my order. Meanwhile I've tried contacting the seller on 01/10 & 01/11 and haven't gotten a response regarding my item. I don't usually complain, but I'm pretty upset right now. I've been ordering items from Amazon for years now and NEVER have had a problem like this! You would think with the way the economy is that you wouldn't treat customers this way!! Most company owners want returning customers!!"
4,Slave Raider - 'Bigger Badder & Bolder' (Blue Ball Records),"Slave Raiders third and final effort - first hit the streets in 1990. I got to see them play a dive on this very tour. I do remember they seemed to have played a lot of covers during their live performance. Tunes here I liked best were the powerful title cut ""Bigger, Badder And Bolder"", their well done AC/DC cover ""Bad Boy Boogie"", their (supposed) anthem ""Who Owns America?"" and ""D. O. A."" - not sure if it's a cover of the old Bloodrock song - doesn't appear to be. Simply too different than the original song. Heard they once opened for Poison and Ratt. Too bad they're not around anymore. Just too many bands, I guess. Still great '80's heavy metal."
1,Manufacturing Flaw,"I bought a replacement coil to fix a failed one for my Toro lawmnnmower. Started up with great satisfaction until about an hour into the job, the mower started to sputter until it died again. I thought it had run out of gas but that wasn't the case. Guess what - same problem as before. No spark from the coil. Everyone must be buying from the same supplier and that company's Quality Control person must be out playing golf with the design engineer. Junk. Next time I'll buy a Honda."
2,Holds bikes OK but beware of your car model and bike size!,This rack does not seem to fit on the Nissan Xterra. The bike arm and upper support bar are one piece so when we tried to position the top bar above the rear windshield wiper the bike arm slanted down towards the ground. The rear windshield wiper on the Xterra does not allow you to position the bottom arm on the bumper with clearance for the wiper at the top. Maybe the rack isn't supposed to rest on the bumper?? Despite our bikes hanging at an angle towards the ground they did seem to stay in place pretty well after hassling with all of those squirrely rubber straps. My husband's bike has a smaller frame though which was a real headache to try and force onto the rack. Sadly we will have to return this rack.
2,Bike Rack Poor Quality Finish,Hollywood Racks B3 Baja 3-Bike Trunk Mount RackThe rack itself has nice features that keep the bike/s firmly in place. It is easy to mount on my Kia sedona van. BUT the quality of the paint on this rack is shoddy at best. After I came home from it's first use I noticed the paint had peeled or flaked off the steel frame of the rack.I'm not going to return it because of the inconvience of that process but will respray it with Rustoleum.I'm very disappointed in the quality of the paint that protects this rack from the elements. My previous bike rack (Graber) is over 14yrs old and is just starting to show signs of wear. I use my bike rack all year long (at the New Jersey Shore) so it is exposed to all of the elements including the salt air.
1,Sinking Wooden Canoe,"The publisher takes a political liberty of reader consent to print this book without reviewing the ""knee deep only"" dimensions of the topics, the slight current reader interests or timeliness to the year 2001. Many of the articles, short and newsy as they might have once been, provide only brief historical interest to a small population of readers who might once have read the articles in a northern, small town, paper. Sorry. I was thoroughly dissappointed."
4,An excellent exercise in atmosphere,"Malle explains in the interview excerpt included on the Criterion release that BLACK MOON is not about plot. It is about capturing moods and tones through various cinematic devices. It is about the unusual characters and situations. They provide the anchors for the film. Malle shoots his film as though it were a dream. Everything is very ambiguous and strange. There's not much I can say about this film that will do it justice, you just have to see it. I didn't know quite what to make of it after my first viewing, I just let it sink for a few days. I'm still not sure how I feel, but I'm glad I had the experience. You just have to let it wash over you. It's very slow and there's usually not much going on in the soundtrack except for ambiance and mumbling. It feels like an early David Lynch film produced by Alejandro Jodorowsky. You will either hate it or it will intrigue you. Either way, if you're a fan of surreal cinema, this is definitely worth a watch."
1,Weirdness for its own sake.,"I like surrealism when it makes some kind of point, but this movie is just pointless. It throws a bunch of weird stuff at you and dares you to make sense of it. Waste of time."
2,Don't see unless you have to,"I wish this movie was great. I ignored the many bad reviews and watched it recently. Louis Malle is my favorite director and I love experimentation and stories about the future and movies with no real plot. This movie has all these elements but it is terrible. I really wish this wasn't the case, but it was so hard to sit through. The actors didn't know what to do and I don't blame them. This is a failed attempt at a movie."
4,8 grams of gold,"When I was in 'nam back in 69 I remember two things, the smell of napalm and the smell of the boys with the hemp. It was everywhere, I remember one time when we took a villagers cow and got it high, then the villager got made at us so we had to pay him for the cow. When we ate the cow we all got high again. Good times.This is a fun product I love to light it, put it in my car and drive around town. I like how the cops pull me over and I tell them they are just pulling me over because I'm white. Good times.Back to my 'nam days, the hemp would grow 20-30 feet high, it was amazing. This stuff is pure magic."
1,waste of money,"My cat hates the noise it makes as much as she is indifferent to the toy. I had such high hopes with the other rave reviews but found this to be another collosal waste. the only toys she's liked are the zany mice, real laser pointer, and the wand with the long pice of flannes."
5,"Ethical 1-1/2-Inch Mylar Balls Cat Toys, 4-Pack","What else can I say? My cats love these mylar balls. They love the crunching sound and they love to pick them up and bat them around the room. The balls are holding up well, too."
5,Cats Love It,"Not all cats like these toys, as I've had some in the past who did not enjoy mylar, but my current cats love them! Thanks for a great product."
3,Fun for a little bit,"My cats were entertained by the Mylar Balls for a bit, but unless i crinkle them and throw them, they don't go for the toys."
3,"Many cats love this toy, but the dye leaks into their water...","At our animal shelter, this toy is a big favorite. It is shiny, colorful, lightweight and makes a crinkling sound when crushed or batted. I would give it five stars except for the fact that if the toy gets batted into the water dish, the dye from the toy will leak into the water, discoloring the water, and the cats will not drink the water anymore. I am not sure if the dye is toxic or not, so I'm glad the cats don't drink it.I would not recommend this toy for cats confined in a small space with an open water dish, but otherwise, this is a great item!"
2,they just dont like em,"only 1 of my 2 cats have shown any interest at all in these mylar toys. Shes attracted to the crinkle sound right before i throw it but they dont go very far cause they're so light + they stop moving almost immediately when they hit the floor so she loses interest pretty quickly. As with most cat toys, you just never know until u get it home. 1 cats treasure is another cats yawn."
4,Kitty Loves Them (but they are not cheap!),"My kitties love these!! All I have to do is crinkle the toy a bit and they come running! I wish they were cheaper, though. And I do periodically have to check under furniture, stove, other appliances, wine fridge, etc. to ""rescue"" all of their toys..."
3,Hard to say,We received the product on time and it was inexpensive. However our cat ignores these things as he does with many typical cat toys. He was a stray so we think he needs more to get him stimulated.
1,Discordant,"I found this old CD and have to say that it holds no appeal for me whatever. I'm a fan of Richie Hawtin, Pete Namlook, Lemon Jelly, Tiefschwarz, and other vintage electronic dance music artists, and this album is going in the trash bin. All predictable, formulaic, and nothing pleasing to me."
1,Birds and other wildlife of south central Texas- Corrie Hern,Totally disappointed. there is not a single illustration.
1,Cheaper than a jump rope from Thriftys! I wasted my money..,"I needed a new jope rope system to replace my leather rope, swivel hand/ base grips.Bought into these reviews and ultimately got a piece of crap.The foam grips are cheap PU and/or eva low density junk.- too small a width for any guy over 5'5"" i would assume. Im 5'11"" and they feel like kidssize.The hand casts are hallow, yes cheap thin cast metal & hallow. Dont let the picture fool you.Finally & most important the rope is a "" cheap hallowed out crazy straw. Its too lite andbasically nothing special.Here is another fly by night marketing gimmic, do not buy these.probably made china at a 1st cost of $6.00!"
2,"ok, but much less than i expected","The reviews were so positive, I had to try this rope. But it's really not that great, certainly not worth 40 bux. A better workout could be had with an Everlast leather rope at half the price, esp adding a pair of wrist weights into the equation."
5,King of Jump Ropes!,"After a year of buying monthly jump ropes, I've finally purchased one that has surpassed all other purchases. Sleek clean design really adds to an incredibly dynamic rope. I jump everyday as a warmup for my other exercises. This rope has proven to surpass all other purchases, and believe me I've bought a new rope practically every month for the past year-plastic, leather, beaded, weighted, and they have all broken. I love this rope...its high revolutions, light but durable construction have been an excellent addition to my workouts. On top of that many of my friends who workout at my gym, take a spin on the rope and are amazed at its performance. Bar none, if you are serious about jump roping then this is the rope for you!"
3,Decent jump rope,"I bought this jump rope for boxing, and while it is better than most that I've used, its speed doesn't warrant the high cost. The build quality is very good and the handles are very nice; however, I've found that its speed is not at all what I expected. Don't get me wrong, it is a very fast and smooth turning rope that would definitely suit the average person, but I expected it to blow away the competition because of its cost. Since using this rope, I've found that my timing has been off, as my old rope was slightly faster than the aero speed. Overall, it is a good jump rope that is just not worth the cost."
3,"Good handle, bad rope, abit too light for me","Over priced.Very good bearing. 5starsCheap rope, too light for high speed. 2starsVery fast shipping. 5starsNot the quality i expected to get from a $40 jump rope."
4,What i needed,"I use expensive equipment to get motivated. I figure if I paid that much for it, I better use it... so I do! I now jump regularly as part of my exercise routine.It's expensive for a jump rope but I like it and i do use it.One of the handle swivels has a wobbly rotation and I haven't quite fixed it. So far, it doesn't deter from my work out."
2,Aero Speed Hyperformance Jump Rope Silver,"I am truly disappointed with this product. The cheap plastic rope is still kinked up from the way it was shipped. I have tried to manually straighten it, but to no avail. A month later, and it is still kinked. $34.50 handles. 50 cent piece of cheap plastic rope. Had I known that it would arrive in this condition, I never would have purchsed it."
2,Great While it Lasted,"I bought it, and for 1 week was very impressed, but after a week of regular jumping (on wood, 160-180 rpm) the rope snapped. I know the rope is cheap to replace, but I expect better quality for a product this expensive."
2,"Love The Handles, Cant Stand the Rope","I bought this rope a few years ago thinking that for the price it would be unparalleled in quality. I like the handles, they seem fine, but the plastic rope that never seems to un-kink is worthless and should be re thought. I would recommend a less expensive better quality rope than this. I would probably give the handles 3 stars, but the rope only one."
5,Good Quality,It is well made and does what it is supposed to do. It will outlast a hundred of the cheaper ones on the markert.
2,"Not a ""Double"" Connector","Unfortunately, one side of the connector did not fit a standard 3/4 inch male hose end. This may have been a problem with my particular unit; I purchased a different Gilmour connector after returning this item and it worked out fine."
4,Helpme--It's The first day of school,"There are a lot of funny parts in this one, however, i gave this book 4 stars because Jake did NOT switch bodies Other than that GREAT book"
4,Fun Read,"This book is great to read for fun. Some parts were funny while other parts are kind of weird. I decided to read it because I'd read other books of Strasser's and enjoyed them so I wanted to read this to when I saw it at the store. I like how he tried to do things differently to end the pattern and thought it was funny how he would think, ""At least I have tomorrow to redo it"" or something along those lines. Then later how he starts predicting things to his sister. This book is great but I wish it were longer and a little more interesting because I'm not sure I'd want to read it again anytime soon."
2,Who wants to read this kind of junk?,This is one of your typical junior high books. Do you honestly want your child to read about wedgies? This book has lots of bad things in it and I really don't think this should be in with good literature anywhere.
1,watch out,"I love Eckhart Tolle and the content of these Cds is beautiful.BUT this 2-CD set is already part of another 6-CD set entitled ""Realizing the Power of Now: An In-Depth Retreat With Eckhart Tolle"".The point is that it is not clearly stated (unless you click on the cover picture to magnify it) and .....they have even used for this product a different title, colour and graphics!As I bought both sets at the same time, when I found it out I felt cheated."
3,Tolle,I enjoyed the message and Tolle's playfulness with which it was delivered. The one complaint I would have is that his voice is too quiet to hear sometimes.
5,Evidence Not Seen,"This book has had a great impact on me. If you are interested in knowing what it means to truly trust God, in spite of personal loss, read this. Darlene Diebler Rose has greatly encouraged me as a Christian. Sometimes Christians are asked to endure great suffering and often without an explanation as to why the suffering is being allowed by a loving Father. She was willing to surrender everything to the Lord and because of herfaithfulness, her victory has been made known to many people. As a result, she has ministered to someone like me who really needed to gain a better understanding of what discipleship involves. Thank you, Darlene, wherever you are!!"
2,Please,"...you've got to be joking. I suppose if you had zero creativity and have never thrown a party before and have no idea where to start, then this would be the book for you. Many of the ideas are just ridiculous and seem to have been thrown in just to fill up space. I found myself laughing out loud many times at the mere thought of actually throwing a party with the suggested theme and elements. There are plenty of other good entertaining books out there with ""grown up"" ideas. Sorry Diane, but this one is a stinker!"
1,Uninspiring,"The author actually recommends a birthday party at McDonald's. Then she assumes we all have silk flowers at home to decorate for a party. The book is outdated and boring. There are absolutely no pictures in the book. I would only recommend this book if you have no experience in party planning and are looking for a drab, run of the mill party that looks as though you stopped at the store Party City to decorate!"
2,Remanufactured Drum Unit,"Unit arrived missing a ""key"" white roller. Not being familar with this printer,,the unit may have worked ok, but I decided to return it and find another supplier.It turns out that there are many variations on the original Dell style of remanufactured drums."
1,What a joke,you get ONE piece instead of the 3 pictured. You can get 3 of these from any other manufacturer for the same price. Never again...
1,deceptive advertising,"I'm very dissapointed with the deceptive ad for what appears to be ""three"" fittings,not to mention over fourteen dollars for ""ONE"" two dollar fitting.I never expected this from AMAZON,this is what I expect from Florida based companys. The reason I mostly shop on amazon is to avoid this type of scam but I guess noplace is safe,I'll be more reluctant to buy on amazon and I'll be sure to warn everyone I can about this scam that amazon is allowing to go on."
1,is theft,"I was very very disappointed when i received the package, only to find one connector for the Aeromotive fuel regulator instead of three as shown in the picture above.Now i have no other choice but to purchase two more additional connectors which is very expensive for plastic feel product in order to use my Aeromotive fuel regulator."
1,doesn't teach,"This is a terrible geometry book! It is confusing, ill-organised, and doesn't teach the lessons, it just gives you problems to do without teaching you how to do them! If your school is making you get this geometry book i would go ahead and get another one along with it so you can actually learn the subject."
1,Not a great geometry book.,"This book fails to teach geometry properly. Sure it lists the theorems and sometimes examples of them. This book doesn't provide enough examples of problems and a better explanation of the topics in order to help the student.Once in awhile an example will come up, but they only help for a problem or two. You're basically stuck trying to figure out a problem. It doesn't even explain how to work on proofs! You're left figuring them out on your own and wondering if you did them right.I believe the other reviewers for the book are either the publisher and authors who want to sell the book. Also instructors who like this book because they have all the answers to them, so they think they know how to do the problems. I'm sure they would be stuck without their solutions manual!There are far better geometry books out there, so teach with those and NOT this one!"
1,horrible book,"it teaches some wierd geometry where the actual theorems have been claimed as postulates. if you'll take a look on page 692 where all ""postulates"" are listed you'll find that many of them are actually theorems (for examples, ""postulates"" 10-14 are theorems and have proof based on real axioms which for some wierd reason are not listed in this book at all!)"
4,4 1/2 stars - challenging math book,"First off, I noticed that alot of people said they couldn't understand any of the problems. That may be true, but as long you read everything, it should be no problem at all. Besides, this book is recommended for honors math students, so it's supposed to be slightly challenging.Pros- the book is well designed, end of every chapter has review notes, summary notes chapter tests, and sometimes cumulative exams as well as preparing for college entrance exams. Every section usually begins with some theroms, and they show you how the prove them. THe back of the book has all the definitions, theroms, postulates and test answers. Challenging in a fun way. The cover is also pretty durableCons- may be too challenging for the average student."
1,worst geometry book ever,i feel bad for anyone who has this book. be ready to do poorly. easily the worst math book i've ever encountered. problems are just not sufficiently explained
3,Geometry Grades 9-11,Can't beat the price. Recommend purchasing prior to your child's class. This way you'll be able to work with child when they are doing their assignments.
4,Good addition to any course,"We used this book throughout last year in geometry and I found it to be helpful in having plenty of sample problems of how to use the things we learned in class. The problem some of the previous reviewers had, of not being able to understand, have a teacher issue, not a book issue. If the teacher taught instead of the book they would be fine."
5,Why does the current description list Alice King as the author?,My son is currently using this book in his (prep) school's highest level geometry class and my daughter is using the Larson geometry book in the highest level geometry course at her (different) high school. There is no comparison between the books. The Jurgensen book is far more rigorous. I am worried that our daughter is not being trained as she needs for a college science major.
1,insolubles,"though this is often a good book, it is riddled with problems that use theorems that have not been introduced, or are insoluble as posed. I have spent over a hundred dollars on tutors to help me get through this, and even doctorates in math were baffled by some of these. It is as though they decided to expand a good basic textbook for the sake of producing an new edition schools would have to by and didn't much care about copy-editing. Not a bad book to teach with if you skip over the bad patches. If you're a student though, you won't be able to tell what's your failure to understand from the book's failures to give good problems. There has to be a better book than this."
4,Good voice and drop-dead gorgeous,"I bought this CD in Buenos Aires along with Diego Torres, Sin Bandera, Alejandro Fernandez, Luis Fonsi, David Bisbal. I must say his voice is unique but not as good as David Bisbal. He has a high young boy's voice. It suits his face and body really.Gosh, he's so gorgeous when he's wet all over. I think most people buy his CD because of his face. OK, I like his songs though ""Ademas de ti"", ""La magia de """
1,100% Dupery - DOES NOT WORK AT ALL,"I've bought a used car, and while the ashtray was clean and new, and there was no smell at the moment of purchase, this was just due to the pre-sale preparation (deodorizing procedure). In a couple of weeks I started feeling the disgusting residual cigarette (or may be cigar) smell...I tried EVERYTHING, including Febreeze, and even a special ""smoke grenade"" that they put inside the car and start the A/C in order to circulate deodorizing gas through the whole system. Nothing worked. I didn't believe in this thing from the start, but was desperate, and tried...Guess what: after 3 weeks of persistent presence inside the car (all instructions were followed) NOTHING changed. So do not throw your hard-earned 35 bucks away!Leo, PA"
3,Not so good,If it kills odors at all it is lightly. Having to dampen it constantly is a little uncomfortable. The price is too high for its performance. Will not take care of pet odors at all. Would lower the rating but the system will not let me. DO NOT BUY!!!
1,Not a good product .,"I had been using this product for almost a year now. I feel this product is too mild to remove any kind of smell completely. And to constantly keep adding water in it is a pain especially in summer time.The price is too high to justify the worth of this product. Neither there is any scientific reason to back its claims as a smell killer.If you want to get rid of the smell in your car then first get rid of the source of the smell. The primary source of foul smell are smoking in the car, eating smelly food in car, spilling food and drinks on upholstry, pets, damp carpet on the floor and finally a dirty cabin air filter. Cabin air filter has a life of one year and should be replaced periodically. This filter can be dirty and become the source of mould growth. The carpet should be dry, if not allow it to dry by removing floor mats and allowing air flow by opening windows.Try and avoid smoking and eating in car. Promptly clean any spills. This way you can eliminate smell."
3,A mixed verdict,"One really has to give two reviews for this book. As a chronicle of fieldwork, it rates a 4. These folks had to face some of the most difficult excavating imaginable - tunneling through hard rock often being pounded by surf!Unfortunately, they give us very little on their thoughts about the lives of the dinosaurs they found other than that their star hypsilophodont probably had unusually acute vision, and fail in that respect where ""Digging Dinosaurs"" and ""Dinosaurs of the Flaming Cliffs"" succeed so wonderfully. One gets the impression that they rushed this book out before fully completing their research, which is a shame because this could have been a very good book indeed if there had been a bit more about the dinosaurs themselves. For fans of dino behavior this really is only a 2."
3,Camera takes good photos,"I have this camera and for the 1st year it performed great for me.love the large touch screen LCD.Great 4 taking pictures in a dark area, flash really does its job.As it stands now the camera will not power on.when i try the only light I get is the blinking green light between the review pictures and camera mode, right below the ( i ) info button on the side of LCD screen.Please someone email me if they know how I can fix this with-out having to pay [...]. Thank You.zfrankwhite@gmail.com"
3,nice features but heavy and no viewfinder,"this camera has some nice features with the large lcd and wi-fi capability, but i did not like the heavy weight (7.9 oz. without the battery). it is hard to hold it steady with one hand. also, there is no viewfinder, so you always have to look at the lcd screen. this could be inconvenient when taking pictures in bright light when there may be a glare on the screen. i don't see the point of the screen rotating when you always need to be looking at it."
3,good for old bikes,none of my old carbs were in it but does have good references for general adjustments. my used copy is in poor shape though. very vintage book. was somewhat helpful with tuning
4,Mojave Dictionary,"I don't know why this dictionary was never published in professional format. It's a good dictionary and there is a real dearth of Mojave language materials around. The book is ring-bound, unprofessionally printed and has typos, but it is also 320 pages long, easy to read, and contains a brief grammatical overview as well as Mojave-English and English-Mojave sections."
1,A bit of a disappointment...,"Well, actually a BIG disappointment! I'm a fan of the ""Byron Era"" Uriah Heep and have recently purchased several DVDs of material from said era. So I was quite excited to see the ""Transmissions"" enhanced CD with its ""rare broadcast performances"". I ordered it and eagerly awaited its arrival. Well, it turns out that the audio tracks are from the ""Live at Shepperton '74"" CD and the videos are same as those that appear on the ""Wizards and Demons"" DVD set. And the so-called 'book' is, in my opinion, nothing more than glorified poorly compiled liner notes. So, my advice is to shell-out a few more $$ and purchase the Castle remaster of ""Live at Shepperton '74"" and the ""Wizards and Demons"" DVD - You'll be waaay more satisfied!"
5,world's best most delicious coffee,I don't know much about coffee but I saw this on Amazon and thought I'd take a chance and give it a try. WoW! I don't think I could ever go back to Starbucks. It is really strong but with no bitterness. I have a friend who knows a few things about coffee and she was really impressed. I totally recommend this product.
2,"Disappointing - In fact, I returned it","The authors of this book have created a listing of 'Free Things' out of mail-in rebate offers and 1-800 numbers from various manufacturers. This information, in large part, is easily obtainable through web pages and/or on the products themselves. There is no real surprise in this book. Do you really need to spend several dollars to receive a hot-line number to a poultry plant? How about an admonishment to get a FREE pet from your local SPCA? I didn't think so either."
2,misidentified,"This coil does NOT fit all lawnboy mowers. it didn't fit my 1992 model. so I did get a return credit, but am still out the freight charges, both ways."
1,BTI Batter,Zero stars - it was defective - never took a charge. Paid more but got a battery from Dell worked immediately. Amazon was great tho - all my money back.
2,Brainless,"I am a seasoned veteran of logic puzzels, lateral thinking problems, math problems, and spatial reasoning puzzles.These are not logic puzzles. They are not word problems. They are not tests of lateral thinking. Rather, they are poorly worded tricks. Everything has a ""trick"" to it. And not like the ""roosters don't lay eggs"" kind of trick, which can sometimes be fun. Not like the old game Mindtrap, which is also fun. Instead, you get these unclear paragraphs that require a few questions be answered before you can even go about thinking through a solution.The complex crosswords are fun, but there are only four of them. Not recommended."
3,No complaints but suggestion!,The delivery time was great. The description could have been more specific - I was looking for logic puzzles of a certain type and could not tell if this book had the right type of logic puzzles from the description.
3,Just don't turn it upside down,"It's a nice mug, holds the right amount of coffee and the Jeff Gordon emblem is pretty cool. But the inner container leaks into the outer one, and whenever the mug is turned upside down coffee leaks out, even after it's washed. The annoyance factor would keep me from buying it again."
3,Copy Right 2002,"I did not realize this book was so old! Book is 11 years old. In the IT world this is pretty old. Haven't read it yet, but it's 11 year old info."
5,good,"Great trade, thank you for shipping it. Though it took bit longer than expected, but i would blame the shipping company for it :-)"
5,Fun cardio dance section & massaging stretch on the roller,This is a fun cardio dance section that warms up the body & has some good moves. One of the moves I modified because it was confusing to me. I really enjoyed it better the second time I did it. The roller stretch section really loosened up tight tense muscles. Trudie & James did an extraordinary job on all of these new dvds. Sting's music is a big added bonus.
1,horrible!,"Everything about the title is misleading. I purchased it because I like the music of Sting. It has only annoying Zither music. There is no instruction whatsoever, and to make it worse, the camera focus stays on their faces so you can not figure it out. I tried it 3 times and felt more frustrated each time. I like exercise dvds and thought this would be like Ellen Barrett.oh well, maybe someone at goodwill will enjoy it."
3,sake box,"Nice, but about half the size as what I have had before. Would be hard pressed to get a cucumber slice in my sake."
4,Hey Sponge Bob Fans!,"I have every thing of Sponge bob in my room. Are you a SpongeBob Fan? Well if you are if you have this game you should saythis is the best game ever! Well... It is! This game is the bomb!I mean, if you get this game, It will be lots of fun. I gurrantee. You get to see Sponge bob of corse! And Sandy, Patrik,Mr. Crabs, and Sqidwerd. So once again I shall tell you this prase and It will be the last time I will say It is the best gameever. Get It!"
4,darn!,"fun game i just can't beat the last level it gets really anoying it was the 1st game i played w/ my SP,I finished 3 games so far but this one stumps me."
2,Waste of Money,"My daughter, age 8, used her savings to buy this game. She says ""It's totally stupid. You can't jump because the bubbles keep popping and you can't really get up anywhere. It's too complicated."" Our other games, Super Mario 3 and Ms. PacMan are much better. She feels really disappointed to have wasted her money."
4,Made My Son Happy,"Game works, and my son enjoys it!! That's what I was shooting for. The game could have been in better shape though."
4,CRAZY SPONGEBOB,This is the part where your in chum worldbefore you can catch plankton you have to finish all thee other levels first.to get a letter you have to go to the left side to shoot some balls in the holes of the ship.
1,Worst baseball game I've ever played,"I've been a longtime fan of the High Heat and Baseball Mogul games, and this was my first experience with the MVP Baseball series.It's definitely going to be my last.While the graphics are great, the controls are completely unamanagable, the gameplay is absurdly unrealistic (everytime anybody throws a pitch over the plate, it's either hit for a double or a home run) and the Dynasty mode is horrific. There's no way to search for players or prospects at all! While the multiple levels of teams and the rookie draft are nice, the rest of this game is awful. Don't waste your time."
5,"to get, or not to get","i have recently bought MVP Baseball 2003, and it was a spectacular game. I've checked with EA Sports, and MVP Baseball 2k4 is quite a step-up. You can manage - and play with - any minor leage team, including the new addition, the New Hampshire Fisher Cats. With new commentary speaches, new gameplay, and harder challenges (for instance, the computer will adjust to your pitches, and start hitting them, even if they're in a cold zone), this game is probably you'd want to grab right away."
2,MVP baseball 2004,"Extreme disapointment! I HAVE a wingman rumblepad, and it still does not work with the game. A waste of 40 bucks as far as I'm concerned...at least until they correct this BIG gaff."
1,HORRIBLE,"I bought this game expecting another awesome EA game only to find out I CANNOT USE MY GRAVIS GAMPEPAD! I can use this gamepad on Madden 2004, NHL 2004 and NBA Live 2004, but I guess it is not good enough for MVP. Sure in Madden I loose out because I don't have the 2 extra analog controllers, whoopie di do. Now I have to shell out more $$ so I can actually play the game. Read the fine print before you buy it."
3,Decent but flawed,"My complaints would be it's seems to run hot and cold. Sometimes you cannot buy a hit, other times you can hit like there is no tomorrow. Had one game recently where the score was 0-0 going into the ninth, The visting team scored 4 runs and then I turned around and scored 5 runs in the bottom of the inning. Good for me but a little unrealistic. Also a lot of times when the runners go past home they do not touch the base but score anyway. Turning double plays seems a little sluggish. Also too many replays although you can skip over them.On the plus side the Sim option is great. You can play portions of games. Like that because I like batting more than pitching. Still getting used to the Dynasty mode. Ended up spending too much money and had to let computer take over for me. Overall a decent but flawed game. It is fun but overall it could be better."
5,SO COOL,"I LUV Dynasty Mode...and the ""Classic Stadiums"" option was the greatest ever. I've always wondered what it would feel like to have a 2004 game played and/or broadcast at Crosley Field or Shibe Park (Cincinnati and Philly for you younger rhubarb fans). I have played as the Twins and have had Morneau and Hunter both hit more than 30 HR's before the All-Star break. What's this about Left Handed batters not hitting taters? BAH!The graphics are hands down the greatest. The fans are still a little thin, but EA is making strides to ensure the baseball stadiums are as lively as the ones in Madden. Give it time..at least MLB bleacher creatures are clapping their hands and you can see some of them in FUBU-like jerseys."
4,Fun...but hard to control,"this game is great. i love the dynasty mode and the way that you can unlock legendary players. The problem for me is that, while playing with a keyboard it seems that it is so much different from playing with a controller. I can never hit homeruns and it is impossible to control the types of slides with the keyboard. Also, at times it is quite hard to get on base, but when your team starts hitting they can score 10 runs in an inning. I'm a huge Giants fan, and without Barry Bonds in this game...it is kind of dissapointing. Team Chemistry and Player Happyness is a interesting, realistic, but also fustraiting part of the game. Overall, this is one of the best sports games that i have ever played and i am literally addicted to it."
1,I like my keyboard!,"This sucks! I buy this game and what do I find out...you don't get the complete game if using your keyboard. I like my keyboard and enjoy playing my other games with it. Why should I have to shell out an additional $20-50 dollars for a gamepad I don't want. EA made a big mistake as far as I'm concerned. And before anyone says, ""Just buy a gamepad"", the answer is no. If EA can't figure a way to incorporate all the controls for my keyboard, then it's time to look elsewhere for software."
1,Play with the keyboard? Forget it.,"This is pathetic. MVP 2003 was a decent game, despite some hinky bugs like fielders never facing home plate with catching fly balls, and some lame baserunning AI.But it was better than the 2004 version, especially if you don't use a gamepad, which I don't. If you're only using your keyboard, about 40% of the features of the game are disabled. Lame.Disabled features when using keyboard only: sliding, diving, leading off, most baserunning, directional hitting, and the fabulous ""Big Play"" feature.I can't believe they'd release a game like this."
5,Helpful for a beginner in preparing for emergencies,"If you have read anything regarding preparing for emergencies or if you have begun your planning, you may be beyond this book. THis is a very basic book.Being basic does not make it any less useful or important. The authors discuss 72 hour kids, types of emergencies, saving food and water. It gives you information on how much and how to store important items.Well worth buying, particularly if you are just beginning the process of planning and thinking about emergencies.Enjoy."
5,really great!!!!,"Hey, I really liked this one, really good. A lot of humor, and a hero that thinks like a man. A load of funny characters, and ofcourse the happy ending. This sort of reading should be pure fun escapism, but well written pure fun escapism. This book delivers 100%"
5,A delightful story,"This was my first book by this author and I must say that I was not only pleasantly surprised but went on to purchase more books by her. I could not stop laughing, crying and smiling all at once. The book was well written and managed to convey a beautiful heartbreaking story of the plight of Miss Lockharte but still make the reader laugh out loud. A definite must read."
4,A true Metzger and another keeper.,"Metzger's characters continue to be off beat and refreshing while remaining true to the Regency period. Miss Lockhart's letters set of a chain of coincidences that seem so hilariously logical that the reader finds it hard to put the book aside until the end. I would have re-read it immediately but my sister was demanding her turn to read it. I love a book that causes me to chortle, chuckle, and guffaw. Metzger always delivers."
2,does not keep her attention,a so so dvd which i bought without renting it first. did not keep my toddler's attention at all
3,Does not flow well. The first half is random. The second half is good.,"The first 15 minutes of the DVD sing the same three songs with different singers or backgrounds. It is very redundant and does not flow well. The last 15 minutes is where they actually have a karaoke party on sesame street. Big Bird, Rosita, Elmo, Maria, and others sing songs with the karaoke machine. I wish the entire DVD was like the 2nd half. They could skip the first half."
3,Cute but could be Better,I purchased this one thinking that it could not only be used as a DVD but as a CDG as well and was wrong. It's cute and my daughter likes to watch it but it doesn't work on a Karaoke machine so I don't understand why they make it seem like it does. Wish I would of known earlier I would of thought twice about purchasing it. If you want it just for home then fine as a movie but no good as a Karaoke CD.
1,Very Disappointed!!!,"The Karaoke Sesame Street was one of my daughters favorite episodes, so when this came out we went right out and bought it.It promises extended versions of the songs -- music videos of the songs in addition to the karaoke numbers. Sounded like a nice idea, but for some strange reason the producers decided to insert the videos INTO THE MIDDLE of the karaoke numbers???My daughter is dancing to Gabby and Miles sing ""New Way To Walk"" when bam, it cuts away to someone else singing it (and she doesn't like as much)...You know it's pretty bad when a toddler complains!!! If they had just inserted the videos at the end of the numbers, or at the end of the video???Anyway, it was repeated this week on PBS, and we taped it. So we have the version my daughter wants...and this is going in the 'ebay' pile..."
2,Scratches wood floors!!,"I own a Miele canister vac as well and always used it on my wood floors with the floor attachment. Then I was talked into buying this cute green stick vac so I would always have a floor vac ""ready to go"" (I do a lot of floor cleaning with 3 boys!). Well, it worked fine for about 6 months, then some metal pieces popped out on the head while I was using it and scratched my floor badly. The vacuum is also heavy and doesn't lean easily against things; mine slipped down and promptly cracked the plastic floor attachment. Miele vacuums vacuum well but their plastic is defective. I've owned slightly cheaper Kenmore's that vacuum almost as well but are a lot more durable. Also, you CAN disconnect the wand from the body and use it as a hand vac, but it is very heavy."
1,HARD TO MANEUVER.,"This stick was disappointing. I own a Miele canister and LOVE it. So I tried the Upright Stick. So disappointed! It was actually heavier then then the canister and much harder to maneuver. They need to go back to the drawing board and work on the design and physics of this so it will easily lean against a wall or surface. It kept falling and nearly fell on my injured leg repeatedly.SO IF YOU HAVE ANY MOBILITY ISSUES, THIS IS NOT THE ONE FOR YOU."
5,the Odyssey Series is truly awesome for young children...,"I teach in a Christian preschool and we have the entire Adventures in Odyssey series in our library. These videos are by far the favorites of our preschoolers. They are full of adventure, excitement, drama and fantasy. But most of all, they teach the children valuable lessons about life. All in half an hour!! What could be better than that?"
2,"Appealing Presentation, Lacking in Content","Although it appears to be a great learning tool, I didn't learn much from this book as I thought I would. It's funny - vocabulary is what I need and this book just didn't provide me with enough of it. The best part of the this book is the first set of words, and the flash cards in the back. I say the flash cards, because I basically borrowed the idea from the book and made my own flash cards from blank ones I found at my bookstore (4""x1.5"" i think) I would write the Korean word on the front with the definition on the back.Nice looking, but lacking. Not worth the money."
4,A good beginners book.,"Very good book for the begginer, not an advanced book. Very simple to follow and the flash cards are a nice feature. You will not learn Korean from this book, but it will make a good companion to begginer just to get familiar with korean words."
2,Some massive errors,"There's some massive pronunciation errors right off the bat (Such as saying 'chair' is pronounced 'oo-ja' instead of 'uija'.) I don't recommend this to anyone who can't read Hangeul, simply because the errors are slightly more obvious if you can read it."
2,"Can be useful, if you have a basic understanding of Korean","This book has many errors in it.The pronunciation for some of the letters are wrong.(""aw"" is shown as ""o"", for example)And even the definition of some of the words are wrong.(the book shows the word ""nan-lo"" means ""stove"", but, really means ""heater"")Don't use this book to learn how to read and write Hangul.It can be helpful to learn vocabulary, as long as you have a friend who knows Korean to make sure you are learning the words correctly."
5,Present from my Korean wife,"My Korean wife chose this book for me as a beginning. I have yet to find a more advanced book that I like as much. It was fun to use, and very easy. I found the romanization helpful while I was learning the Korean characters (Hangul).A great way to start.I see there is now a version available with CD. That should be even better, but I haven't had a chance to listen to the CD."
2,Good concept - Bad choice of words,I am trying to learn enough Korean to be able to function in Korea even if on my own. The words chosen for the flash cards are not much help for what I wanted (unless I am at the zoo). This is a great concept but...if you are like me and want to learn words that will help you communicate in everyday situations save some money and make your own flash cards.
3,"Good to get you started, but ignore Romanizations","This book is great to get you started with learning some of the basic words so that you can apply them to sentences later. However, like many books on Korean, the Romanization is aweful. If I did not already know the alphabet and pronouniations, I would have been been saying all the words very wrong (www.langintro.com is a great place to learn along with a native Korean speaker). I was always having to cover up the Romanizations on the flashcards because my native-English eye would go right to them. I also found that I stopped using the little excercies mid-way through the book and just used the flash cards."
4,Pretty good price for a good product,I searched for the IMR9D-9H across the internet and most were asking about $15 + shipping. So today's $10.49 each with free shipping over $25 is a pretty good price. These things are expensive though. I also have a Honda F12 (non turbo) Aquatrax PWC.
4,"great, but sometimes stumbles","My problem with the book is pretty small. For the most part I think it is a very beautiful and special book. The shawls are beautiful and the text is interesting. My only problem is that the instructions for the full-size shawl are a little iffy in points, like telling you to knit in the ""corner stitch"" without once ever explaining this maneuver. Mostly a beautiful book, though"
5,A Great Tutorial on Knitting Orenburg Lace,"This book is extremely detailed in the art of knitting Orenburg Shawls. There are charts for basic patterns used in the traditional shawls and at the back a full shawl is charted for practice knitting Orenburg Lace. There is even a small sampler shawl you can knit to learn the techniques of the full sized ones. A great book, necessary for any lace knitter."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"I ENJOYED CHOCOLATE SANGRIA. IT WASNT MY FAVORITE BOOK, BUT IT WAS A GOOD READ. EVEN THOUGH I LOOK A LOT LIKE JUANITA, WE ARE NOTHING ALIKE!! THERE WAS A LOT OF DETAILS IN THE BOOK BUT THE CHARACTERS LACKED SOMETHING. ALL AND ALL AN ENJOYABLE READ!!"
1,Puerto Rican <--- this is how it's spelled!,"This book could have been 100 pages less if the author did not spend her time describing every single unnecessary detail. It was almost like the author had a page quota to meet!!! Also I grew up in Central Islip and trust there are NO mansions there not in 1979 or ever! Puerto Rican was spelled wrong purposely at least 3 different ways, and the Spanish that was used in the book was often mistranslated. Don't waste your money or time on this book!"
3,Okay,This book was okay. It was kind of sad and easy to figuare out how it would turn out. Besides that it was an okay book
2,Unnecessary descriptions,"I read Chocolate Sangria with my bookclub in hopes that we would all get a cultural insight from Ms. Thompson. Boy, were we ever disappointed!!!! Unfortunately, the author wasted too much time describing the sexual scenes, that it took away from the plot, which was actually very intriguing. My suggestion to Tracy Price-Thompson: if you want your readers to continue to read your books, I suggest you mellow down on the extremely detailed sexual scenarios,and focus your energy on the plot of your book...unless of course you're writing for Harlequin."
5,SEVEN HOURS LATER...,"Well, I've done what I haven't done in a long time...finished a book in one day. Seven hours to be exact. I could not put Chocolate Sangria down.Straight from the heart -- Bravo Tracy. Bravo.Margaret Johnson-Hodgeauthor of ""True Lies"" and ""A Journey To Here"""
3,ok,Chocolate Sangria was an ok book. Though the sex scenes in the book were a little intense it was ok for someone who doesn't get bothered by gay sex. My boyfriend started reading it and just couldn't explain to me why he didn't like it and just made me read it...once I started reading it...I understood...other than that the book was face paced and was definitely a page turner...Hense being a Okay book!!!!
3,Good book,"I enjoyed this book. Although somewhat graphic, it was a very interesting read. It makes you laugh and cry because there are scenes where I got a little mysty eyed. I did enjoy it though."
3,Good Story,"Juanita Lucas is a 19 year old college student, who lives with her aunt and uncle. She is made fun of by the neighborhood girls because of her light skin and green eyes. Juanita was told the her mother died while giving birth to her. He best friend is Socrates ""Scooter"" Morrison. Scooter is also made fun of becuase he has "" a little too much sugar in his tank"". While riding on the bus, they notice a pair of Puerto Rican men and so the story begins.Juantia becomes interested in Conan Lucaus, who is haunted by the death of his twin, Thor. (The names in this story are really out there) This story is very well written eventhough at times it becomes predicable. Price-Thompson tells a very interesting story of racism and jealousy that any one will enjoy.Peace and Blessings!"
3,Okay Read,This was a well written read but the ending did not really end. It was kind of sorta happy. But there were many unanswered questions. Like what's going through Scooter's mind. This book did explore issues that other authors are afraid to touch because they are afraid it might not sell. These issues were explored i.e. interracial children where do they fit in and also being a Gay Black man. In African American communities we are sometimes afraid of these issues and act as if they don't exist. This author also touched on bulimia which some African Americans would say never exists in their community but it does and why because some of us don't think that we are beautiful. But my sisters I'm here to tell you we are the most beautiful creatures that God has placed on this earth.
5,Tracy Price-Thompson is the BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It never cease to amaze me how Tracy P. Thompson continues to come up with these intersting ideas to produce these great books. Lets give credit where credit is due. Tracy is awesome. Buy the book! Her creative juices just flow and flow.
2,Everything you wanted to know; you'll still want to know!,"I teach in an EMS program and bought the video to use in teaching. It was even less informative than the shows you see on TLC or Disc channels. I realize this is a very dark subject, but the video boasted how informitive it was; it wasn't. Luckily it had a 100% satisfaction return policy."
2,"Jesus, take a chill pill","I am a devoted fan of the beatles and I do see a very strong blues influence on them. I also love the blues, however, when I saw a cd named ""Beatles Blues"" I thought it was a collection of just thier bluesy songs, ""yer blues, she's a women, I just don't understand, the first takes of Helter Skelter ext. ext. I don't hate the CD but I did feel a little cheated. I only wrote my first comment so that not so educated beatle fans wouldn't be duped into buying something that they might not want. Peace out"
2,Beatles Blues?,I was sooo stoked to find out that ehey were putting out a cd with just the beatles bluesy songs but then I looked at the track listings and found out that its a various artists thing. I ordered it anyway and I don't like it. It takes away from the greatness of the beatles.
5,Great book!,"I had this book as a child and LOVED it. My kids like my old copy, but it finally fell apart, and I need a replacement. It's cute enough to buy twice. :)"
1,One of the worst,"I live in Hawaii, and bought this shirt and one other by Winnie Fashion. I returned them both. They are very poor quality. Don't be fooled by the ""pretty"" prints, and colorful look. I've been in Hawaii for over 40 years, and I know Aloha shirts. These shirts are not quality Aloha shirts by any means. I was fooled, because I've been in the Hawaiian clothing manufacturing business, and I know what quality is all about. I learned a hard lesson from this purchase. Unless you know the name, beware of the game! This purchase not only wasted my time, but I had to return the shirts at my own expense!"
4,Love It!!,"I use mine in the closet where we have two litter boxes for our cats. You don't realize it's working because you can't smell anything but I can tell a difference in the smell when the SmellKiller runs out of water. Our condo is only 780 square feet, so you would certainly know it if there was a big mess in the litter boxes. I have to go and check in the closet to see if it needs to be cleaned out. I like the Universal one because it seems to me that it would be harder to keep up with the water levels in the regular ones. Since the metal piece has to be in both water and air, it seems easier to get the Universal so you don't have to monitor the water level in the cup."
3,a little disappointed,"The product seems to be working all right, but will NOT stay on the wall. The adhesive keeps coming off of the plastic case and the whole unit goes crashing to the floor -- I was concerned that the adhesive would come off of the wall. I had no idea it would be coming off of the unit itself. It has come down in the middle of the night several times. Very irritating."
5,Keeps catbox smell away,"I really did not expect this to work, but it really did. I placed it in the laundry room next to the catbox, and the odors are gone. The cats even go in there now!"
2,Not totally sure it works,"It seemed to work when I first got it, but I'm not really sure anymore. When I first got it, I changed the litter and put the Smellkiller right near it. Usually after I change the litter, I can still smell the litter, it just smells clean; this time, I couldn't smell anything. I keep the sponge moist and it still sits in the small area where the litter box is; for the most part, I don't notice any smells, but I'm not sure if that is due to the Smellkiller or because I use A&H; Baking Soda Kitty Litter, a 2nd litter with crystals, AND the A&H; litter box deodorizer powder.I suppose it works ok, but I wouldn't buy another one, and I don't think it works the miracles claimed in other reviews. Also, mine didn't stay on the wall either...came crashing down only 1 day after I put it up. Now it just sits on top of the litter box."
3,Broken upon delivery,"The dishes that were in tact did look very nice. The shipper was not careful at all and the packer could have done a better job as well. In the end I need more durable over better looking. Also, I was not able to find the specs on what dishes are included and, as the picture only shows four dishes, I assumed that 20pc meant serving for 5. It is not. I'm not usually one to complain, but this purchase didn't go well for me."
3,Does a pretty good job,"If you're not looking to spend a lot of money on a router solution, this adapter is your product. Do be careful when mounting the item. It wont take too much to strip the plastic threads. This works for the weekend warrior, but is definitely not professional grade"
4,Most important book on my book self,This children's book would be the most important book on my book self and the reason that I do most of what I do. I will teach from these lessons and I will raise my child based on these lessons. It really is this simple and I hope you will take the simplicity offered in this book as a gift just for being born to this lifetime.
5,The Three Questions,I loved this book. I was inspired to purchase the Leo Tolstoy book that it was taken from. Excellent illustrations. I have read it many times since purchasing it.
5,Three Questions,The book based on a Leo Tolstoy story is beautifully illustrated and talks to children about making the best decision in a given situation. I used it with my fifth grade class to talk about doing the right thing. They liked it.mtk
2,Trite and arrogant,"As a great fan of Tolstoy I am certain he would be mortified to be touted as the inspiration for this book. There is an arrogance in the communication of the moral message that the author wishes to send and could there be a more trite ""situation"" for his main character to ""happen upon"" in order to ""save"" the victim and be the hero? Puh-leeze."
4,A great book to talk about,What a wonderful book. It really gives you a great starting place for basic discussions with children. It gives good tools to help a child with basic problem solving and teaches them that everything in life can be seen from differrent perspectives.
5,The book every child must read,"This is a great story, such a welcome departure from the usual silly/empty books kids read. It is imaginative, endearing, with great lessons and great illustrations. My children ages 3 and 6 ask for this book repeatedly (for different reasons). The young one focuses on the storyline and the animals, the older has begun to grasp the true message. I love the fact that the boy in the story has a hard time making the right decisions in the beginning even though he wants to with all his heart. Older kids will relate to this very well.These are the kind of books that leave an impression and help shape children into good people."
5,Amazing!,This book is truly amazing! Can't believe I've been teaching 40 years and had never read it to my class! It was perfect for teaching many comprehension strategies! AND it come so fast!!!
5,The Three Questions,"I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker who works with children and adults and I plan on using this book in therapy sessions. I also give my grown children a book each year for Christmas and The Three Questions is this year's pick. I want them to realize that wherever they are or have been, they can make a difference."
4,Just as ITM promised....,"No unwanted surprises. ITM said the overwrap was gone, it was; the white security strip intact, it was; and never viewed...idk about that, but the movie was in great viewing condition. So I'm pleased."
5,New-age fairy-tale,"This is a very good flick, I recommend any and everyone to see it. Christina Ricci is spectacular and James McAvoy is...well, James McAvoy hasn't starred in a single movie I haven't liked. Even Reese Witherspoon's short little stint is delightful!"
3,"A lot of promise, but the film ""Penelope"" never had the revelation that character Penelope did.","While this movie had some great messages, they often got buried in a film that didn't quite know if it wanted ot be a fairy tale or a social commentary on self worth. The greatest fairy tales have the ability to mix a nice social commentary and ""lesson"" into it's whimsical world. At times, ""Penelope"" seemed schizophrenic rather than a cohesive story that could have been very charming.I enjoyed it, but after it went off I found myself focusing more on what was wrong about it rather than what was right and that isn't typically how I process movies.I cautiously recommend it."
3,Wish it was better,This is a sweet fairy-tale story. I did enjoy it but felt that this movie is too busy. I could go without witnessing Penelope's love interest's (James McAvoy) dark side of gambling and struggling to put his life together again. We don't really see how he comes to love her or why as they only spent a few times together in separate rooms with a two-way mirror between them. Maybe he was charmed by her cute voice and plucky spirit? The art direction is fabulous and Peter Dinklage and Reese Witherspoon are standouts here. It's hard to articulate what I don't like about this film; it simply felt too rushed with several subplots that it was overwhelming.
3,It's exactly what I paid for!!,"It's a simple love story of a guy lost in the world who gambles non-stop to fill the empty void in his life and BLAH BLAH BLLAH... and a girl with a pigs nose who needs to marry a blue blood(rich guy) in order to break the curse yadda yadda *yawn*...One of ""those"" fairy tale love stories that is short but sweet. If you hate corniness, love, and anything related to fairy tales stay away from this one. You've been warned... (O__o)"
4,Review of Penelope,"I bought this movie because our 17 year old son recommended it. He watched it at a friend's home and said it was good enough to buy. My husband and I liked it very much. It is a make-believe magical story set in our contemporary world. It had good humor, no bad language except for 3-4 less offensive swear words, no immorality shown and it also showed human behavior at its worst and best. I especially liked the three leads: Penelope, the young man she eventually dates and marries, and Penelope's mother. All fine actors."
5,Sweet and Magical,"This was a beautiful modern day fairy tale, and I absolutely loved it! There's a curse in Penelope's family that was cast many many years ago, and her mother has been finding a way to break it. Men have run away from her time and again, until one. Of course, he turns out to not be the one they think he is, and Penelope decides to venture out in the world against her mother's better wishes. It's sweet, funny, romantic, and very uplifting."
4,"A Very Cute Girl- uh, I Mean Film. Cute Film","I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, as I entered it with zero expectation for enjoyment. As a guy, I am not inclined to fantasy/romances.However, this movie was well cast, making the characters very enjoyable.(Especially Penelope's mom, played brilliantly by Catherine O'Hara.) And despite the pig snout, cute Christina Ricci alone made it worth the money. James McAvoy also turned in a nice performance. (Special note to the scene when he sings ""You Are My Sunshine."") And Reese Witherspoon was awesome!Sure it got cheesy at times, but what else can we expect from a PG love movie? I definately recommend seeing this film. It'll be worth your time and money."
4,Great lesson,"Love how the story gives a great lesson in self acknowledgment and love, wrapped in a sweet fun story. My kids love it as well, counts for alot."
5,Love this movie,Great family film and teaches self respect so good lesson to learn. Loved the way it was filmed with whimsy instead of full on fantisy.
3,Christina Ricci has never looked better. Even with the pig nose.,"Penelope is a fun little movie even if her suitors are over reacting to her nose and ears. I've always had a soft spot for Ms. Ricci and would marry her even with the pig nose. The rich part would be icing on the cake. The movie is fun and has its amusing and tear jerker moments, so as long as your not looking for deep meaning or some mystical self wakening experience you'll enjoy it."
3,longing to be loved,"this movie while entertaining was just not what i expected.i watched it a second time several months later to see if the mood had changed,well not really.but a'm sure it's a good movie for the younger generation."
3,Pig love.,"Penelope is a strange romantic film. Christina Ricci and James McAvoy have wonderful chemistry but I felt letdown by this coming-of-age fantasy. The story is a bit wooden and forced, it was difficult for me not to lose interest within the first 30 minutes. Reese Witherspoon also stars and produced this film, I just love her bumble bee costume at the Halloween party - her character is funny and edgy, Reese saves this film in my opinion. Great acting but I was expecting so much more, it's a mixed bag for me."
5,Great for the whole family,"My boyfriend and I both loved this movie. It had a great story line, great acting and it was funny. It's a movie the whole family can watch together."
4,Enchanting,"I was surprised by this movie in a good way. Having never once heard of it in the theatres I saw a preview for it on a DVD I had purchased and kept my eyes open for it after that. I was not sure what to expect, but the story line was original, funny and well-played by al the actors, especially Catherine O'Hara as Penelope's mother who you wanted to slap more than sympathize with. The tale moved between the fantastical and the ordinary so well that you felt it was possible for this to actually happen and wonder why you'd never heard of it before. Christina Ricci gave Penelope a wide-eyed innocence while never seeming fake and ingenuine, and James McAvoy (a lot scruffier than I feel he needed to be), displayed a range of emotions just in his eyes that made you root for his character despite the obvious flaws. Give this movie a chance to surprise and enchant you; I don't believe you'll be sorry."
5,Still in my game library,There are only a few titles I have kept from my PC gaming days and this is one of them. I had a lot of fun with the story and puzzles. The ending was a let down but the rest of the game was pretty solid to me.
4,Enjoyable,For clarification I am not big on puzzle games. I actually found this game frustrating at times and a bit complicated. But after going over possible solutions for up to an hour at a time it was fun when I finally solved them. Now remember what I said about not being big on puzzle games because I will probable have to buy the manual because I am stuck at a certain point in the game. So if you are good at or enjoy puzzles this is the game for you.
3,For the Casual Letter,"I was not familiar at all with the Mr. Lunch line of merchandise, I'm not even sure exactly who Mr. Lunch is to be honest. But while searching around through for different stationary I happened to stumble upon this and thought ""awwwh how cute"" and on a whim bought it. It's not for the serious letter writer, it's near impossible to write on more then one sheet of paper without having to force the second piece inside of the envelope and then tape down all of the sides because the envelope won't seal. So if you're looking for just a smaller pad for you to write a casual letter to a friend to then this is definately the pad for you. Otherwise I recommend searching somewhere else for a stationary set"
3,Kind of Flimsy,"I was disappointed because I expected the paper to be thicker, more like cardstock, but it was just like notepad bad. Very cute designs. We do use them, and so far everyone has made it unscathed through the mail. I was worried the paper would get caught in the sorting machines and torn or ripped up because of the folds and the weight of the paper."
2,Anyone have the NFS: Hot Pursuit 2 Cd to sell instead?,"I'd RATHER have the Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 Soundtrack, a.k.a>. EA Games Trax Cd. But........if this is the Best I can get(just to get the ONLY Good song>>""Ordinary""), then I'll get THIS cd. If you LOVE the song ""Ordinary"" from the NFS:HP2 game, this is a start. Too bad the ""instrumental"" version of ""Ordinary"" ISN'T on this cd also. Oh well, my continued search for ALL the songs from Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 game is ON once more......"
1,Not Worth the money or the time,Amateur job...looks like a home movie and a waste of money. It doesn't really tell you any more than the actual information you can get from online or from NCL. I would not recommend this unless you're into watching someone's home video.
3,Helpful -- but still made of plastic,"This has already helped me get more organized for the holidays. Especially since I don't have that much stuff -- just needed a place to put it. That said, it is made of plastic. The quality I would describe as: ehhhhh. Not likely to last very long."
5,love it,"I love this item, it has saved so much space in my closet and made it easier to find wraping paper, etc. no complaints."
2,Smaller than it appears.,"Pay attention to product dimensions. Appears to be larger than it is - the rolls of wrapping paper in picture MUST be tiny rolls. Other than its size, it is an OK organizer. It sets up easily and is easy to access."
3,Should have kept on shopping,"This was an ok product that met some of my needs. The biggest issue was the size of some of the holders such as the scissor pocket was not big enough at all. Also, I didnt have anywhere to put a large amount of tissue paper since the backside only held a small amount of paper bags. I did like its capability to make a 360 degree turn but I wouldnt recommend it to anyone-I should have kept shopping around."
1,Definitely overpriced for the quality,The plastic on this product was ripped when it arrived. It is very cheaply made. Definitely overpriced for the quality.
5,Love this organizer,"Purchased this during a recent reorganization of the closets at my home. This works much better than the previous organizer I had. It saves floor space since it can be hung in a closet, and has plenty of room for rolls of paper, bags, bows, tissue paper, scissors, etc. Overall, I'm really happy with this organizer."
1,Made with the same plastic it it came in...,"This picture looks great however this is made of the same plastic that the throw away bag it comes in is... The best thing I can say for this is that it was returnable, even though I lost shipping money."
3,If only it held as much as the picture,"First off, I don't know how they got all that stuff in the organizer in the picture! Second, when you do fill it up, somehow this things sort of ""flips"" around and the rolls almost fall out because it leans forward so much. It is a very flimsy plastic as well - the kind that will tear if you force it too much."
1,Wrong item sent. Does not have hanger on it,I hate it when they send a similar item. I did not get same item. FIrst it was black and second it did not have a hanger built in on top. It has 5 button snaps instead. Annoying.
4,Works well,"It has enough room for most of my gift wrap materials, and it doesn't take up much space. I like it!"
1,Cheap and flimsy,"This item is cheaply made. The plastic is very thin and flimsy. The opening to the areas to hold ribbon is a cut in the plastic. After use, I am certain this opening will continue to rip. Additionally, the area to hold the rolls of wrapping paper is not adjustable. Therefore, the rolls fall forward and make the entire organizer fall to one side. I would not recommend this product- especially at this price point. I have since purchased another at half this price and it is made with thick plastic and compartments with zippers."
2,could be better.,"Made from really cheap plastic. Really really cheap plastic. The hook hanger head isn't curved long enough, so when you hang it it may fall off your rod. This will work better if hangs flat against a wall. If you have tall wrapping paper....this wont fit in your regular standard closet. It could work on the back of a door."
2,Not what I was expecting,"It does what it's supposed to do, but it's very flimsy, and most of the compartments are not as roomy as I was expecting. Definitely not worth 20 bucks."
1,bad choice,"I'm trying to organize my space and this item was a very big disappointment. It fell apart upon trying to fit items into the areas as displayed in the photo-packaging. The organizer was easily torn and did not balance well with items loaded as displayed in picture on package. The retaining straps for the vertical rolls of paper were too long and droop allowing the paper rolls to fall forward and pull out of the organizer. The areas for bows allow bows to fall out. The area for rolls of ribbon are difficult to fill and the material is easily torn. Actual use of the item is difficult; replacing items after use tore the ""assigned"" compartment even more.I'm looking for another storage solution, this one did not work."
1,Disappointed,"Very disappointed in this product. Cheaply made and very flimsy. I pulled this out last night, excited to start organizing and saw that 2 of the front pockets had rips across the plastic. Wouldn't recommmend wasting money on this item!"
1,Doesn't work well....,"I purchased this to organize scattered Christmas wrapping supplies. Unfortunately, this looks a lot better in the picture than it does in real life. It also doesn't work well at all. Once you put wrapping paper in the side areas that hold wrapping paper, there is no real way to secure it tightly so that it doesn't flop around. The hanger also can't take a lot of weight on it. I tried two medium wrapping paper rolls on each side and some tape and bows in the middle section. It wouldn't stay up and hung kind of lopsided. Right now it is laying down and barely holding it's contents. I'm going to have to switch to a different wrapping paper organizer. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. :("
1,Cheap material and poorly designed,"I really loved the idea of this item. I purchased this item after loving theJokari Gift Bag Organizer, Whiteand wanted it's sister product!. I was very disappointed with the hanging gift wrap organizer. First of all, it was much smaller than I had imagined. But that's my own fault for not paying closer attention to the dimensions. Next, The plastic was cheap and flimsy. Finally, the whole thing was just poorly designed. I placed about 6 rolls of paper (3 on each side), and the whole thing wobbled and hung lopsided. Even the hanger seemed like it was strained from my measly 6 rolls of paper. I can't imaging using it for 12 rolls of paper, as the description claims that it can. I ended up returning it, and purchasing a tall plastic storage container by sterilite to stand in the corner of my closet to hold my gift wrap."
1,Missing parts and cheaply made,"I had the previous model. It wery well made with fabric netting, and I love it. Needed one more.Found it is now made only in plastic.Ordered it, Amazon sent it quickly. The thing looks and feels like a cheap thing. I would need to use a hair dryer to soften the plastic compartments into shape ( or hang it outside on a hot day).BUT HERE IS THE REALLY BIG PROBLEM.IT IS MISSING THE CARDBOARD STIFFENERS THAT THIS CHEAP VERSION NEEDS TO MAKE THE PLASTIC COMPARTMENTS HAVE A USABLE SHAPE.Yeah, assembly is required. BUT THE STIFFENERS ARE NOT IN THE PACKAGE.So I notified Amazon I needed a replacement. The new one arrived lightning quick.IT HAS NO STIFFENERS EITHER.The item is useless and I have had it.So I am just returning it for a refund. I cannot see re-ordering the item. Obviously a batch of these things was shipped without the needed pieces.I am not a happy camper."
2,Would be nice...if only...,"It has a great design, but the quality of materials is seriously lacking. The clear plastic started ripping in one area as I unfolding it. Most of the plastic seems just about to rip if given any tension. Also, the velcro doesn't hold very well."
3,for lightweight organizing,Good for basic organizing of a FEW items. Will not hold a lot. Rips easily.The hanger broke and everything was on the floor. Update10/2012 - in the trash
1,Torn on arrival,"This product tore the moment I took it out of the box. I read all of the reviews that warned of similar ease of tearing but thought I'd simply be more ginger with it. It practically ripped to the touch. It was impossible to even unfold it, let alone put anything in it, without the plastic tearing at the folds, or the pockets or velcro tearing away from the piece itself.It's too small for my purposes, as well, but that's subject to personal needs. I will say that the center compartments for storing bows and ribbon are too stiff to open enough to fit bows in without crushing them.Overall, the primary and pretty much the only necessary thing to mention is that it didn't last a half second upon arrival. $20 down the drain."
2,Broke Quickly,Installed and lasted 2 winters before fan switch failed.Worked fine until it failed. Cheaply made. Go for something sturdier.
4,no complaints,"This was exactly what we were looking for to replace our old thermostat. It was super easy to install, and got here in a reasonable amount of time."
3,Good Product,The product is good. Like most new products today all minor direction buttons (i.e. on-off switch) are marked so small and lightly that you need a light near by to read them. And I do have 20/20 vision!
2,This thermostat is definitely not recommended,"I have had this thermostat for two years, and I have had enough.If you set the AC temp at 80 degree, it might go all the way to 75 degree.Sometimes, when the room temperature is at 82 deg. You set the AC temperature to 78 deg, the AC just refuse to start.If you want a working thermostat go with the Honeywell programmable one(we also have RTH6400D from Honeywell which is great).If you enjoy frustration, buy this product. I gave it two stars for the cheap price."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"This is junk. The batteries don't quite fit right, so I continually have to jiggle the batteries to get it to go on...this was after replacing the batteries with new ones several times until I realized it had nothing to do with the batteries, but the poor make of the unit. THEN...tonight was the final straw. Sometimes, it will take a long time to turn on, or will turn off before it gets to the desired heat. Tonight I came home, and although I had the heat set to 70, it never stopped running. When I came home it was 94 degrees in my house! Thank God my dogs had plenty of water because my house was an oven. I have to wonder if I had stayed out later, just how high the temperature would have gotten in my home. I am replacing this with a better one tomorrow, the savings just isn't worth it and now I can't imagine what my electrical bill will be like!"
5,This is really yummy,We had some over the weekend. I mixed it with 4 large avocados and we had plenty for leftovers.
1,Criss Cross Applesauce,"Bought a pouch of this mix at our local grocery store. After mixing with three avocadoes, it created the oddest tasting guacamole I've ever had. After a few spoonfuls my husband and I determined it tasted like applesauce. Very strange. We ended up adding a bunch of other spices from home to try and salvage it. If you are going to use a mix, I'd recommend sticking with the dry packets you can find in the produce section. This was a tasteless disappointment."
1,Disappointed Overall,"I gave this as part of a secret santa gift for someone who loves to make guacamole. I was suprised to see that it's a condiment that you must refrigerate and use within a few days once opening rather than a dry seasoning. I paid too much for it given the cost of shipping only to find it available at my local Waldbaums supermarket. I bought some for myself to taste what I had given as a gift and was simply not at all impressed by the flavor it added. This surprised me as I have seen Chef Bayliss' show on tv and expected something more. I should have known better. Guacamole isn't difficult. Avocados used at the right stage are delicious on their own. Use cilantro, some sort of acid, lemon or lime, chopped onions, tomato and salt and you don't need anything else."
3,"excellent details and inventiveness, disapointing execution","The potential is there, but it is never fulfilled. The initial premise is interesting, the alien ghost in the machine that could have been mindblowing is far too simplistically treated and makes no real impact on the plot. The plot discontinuities and lack of coherence become jarring after a while. The characters always felt shallow, particularly outside the two main protagonists. However, the metaphors and attempt to link the historical Venetian city state and the virtual reality future rescue the book from complete disaster."
5,Future Venice in technology age,"Beautiful imagery in the imagined world of future Venice, parallelled with the online world created by master artisans. Everyone has a masque, or an avatar, that portrays them in the digital world. What happens when power struggles between the creators, an unknown digital presence, and a brilliant student of the digital arts?"
4,"Good Fun, If Not Iris Murdoch's Best","Iris Murdoch's death is a great loss but she leaves such a wonderful, rich legacy. Jackson's Dilemma is much lighter on philosophy than previous books and is by no means among her stongest (for me, The Unicorn, A Severed Head, The Flight from th Enchanter, but it is hard to select when the picking's are all so ripe). Despite that it is still a good read, particulary for those readers not familiar with Dame Murdoch, and this could, hopefully, lead these readers further into the treasure trove left behind by the very sad passing of the author. All the basic themes and situations that Dame Murdoch likes to play with are in Jackson's Dilemma, from the the antic comings and goings of friends and lovers to the observer who knows something no one else does know. A good read."
2,The Reader's Dilemma,"My dilemma was whether to finish this annoying book or not. My choice was to finish it, hoping it would be redeemed by the clarification of Jackson's Dilemma at last. It was not.I found the dialogue repetitive, overly sentimental, hard to follow (like very bad stream of consciousness)and the characters, other than Owen and Jackson, uninteresting people with too little to do and too much time to think about it.There was some plot resemblence to A Midsummer Night's Dream, or A Winter's Tale, but in this book at least, Iris Murdoch is no Shakespeare.Unfortunately for me, this was my first Iris Murdoch. It will be awhile before I pick up another."
3,ESU reptile heat and light dome,"the product does its job fine...the big proble is it has no switch what so ever. Everytime i have to go under the terrarium and unplug it to turn it off.and the same thing to turn it on in the morning. Other than that, its much cheaper than in stores....3 out of 5 starts.-italian stalian-"
4,looks great,"Looks great, and is durable. Only problem with it i have found is the clear plastic piece on top of the black cover can break, so be careful with it. It is great for the price and perfect for a bar where the blender will be visible."
5,Strong Production and Lyrics,"This project is one that need to be heard by many. Title cut My Change Has Come grabs out to you with a great drive near the end at what some would call vamp. Track #2 Open My Heart, I have no words for. Should be on Billboard and that's a fact. Industry need to take a good look at this artist."
5,Mold & Mildew Resistant Shower Curtain,"I love this shower curtain! Normally after a couple of days, other shower curtains I had previously owned would begin to develop mold. Not this one! Even after 3 weeks, no mold! Yay!"
2,Picture does not match product,"Very nice shower liner, but the photograph of the product shows a white shower curtain and the liner sent is clear. If a clear liner is what you want, great product! If you are looking for a white curtain, this may not be for you."
2,Unhappy with product,"I was tired of buying cheap shower curtains that turned moldy in a few months, so I decided spending a little more for this one was worth it. However, I've had it in my shower since it arrived in February (less than 6 months ago) and it's already moldy/mildewy on the bottom and part of the side closest to the faucet/showerhead. In all fairness, I haven't cleaned it, but I always spread it open after showering so I was hoping the coating would be sufficient to prevent the mildew. I'll clean this one but in the future, I'd rather spend $3 on cheap shower curtains twice a year."
4,Good buy,This shower liner is heavy-gauge vinyl with gussets at the top to keep it from tearing. The delivery was good and we're pleased with this purchase.
4,Satisfied,"The liner is thick, strong and sturdy. The grommets are nice and strong. Now let's see how strong it holds up under the mildew."
5,Mold Resistant Shower Curtain,"I had already purchased a previous mold resistant shower curtain from Amazon and this one is very similar. I love them both and they seem to be living up to their claim of being mold resistant!I'm very happy with the product, as well as, the ordering and delivery service.Thanks so much!"
3,Somewhere between Lovejoy and Wallander?,"Detectives with angst seem to work better in cold climates. Really handsome (coy) detectives probably should not take themselves too seriously. I like Rufus Sewell, but the broody, steamy thing just didn't work for me in these episodes. I think a lighter touch might have been better."
3,GOOD SHOW BAD MUSIC,I liked this show very much I am sorry it was never renewed by the BBC. Maybe someone else is like me and the repetative noise (dare I call it music) all but ruins the show for me as I just want to run screaming from the room. Just as I get ready to do that it stops and I can enjoy the show again. I really do like the show. The same bars of music playing over and over is not music. It is an annoyance.
2,Slow and boring...,"Beautiful lead characters, lots of talk, slow and boring. Turned it off part way through. A waste of time and money."
4,Well plotted,Standard detective fare elevated to a level of interest necessary to engage my further viewing. Incongruous use of English and Italian actors but you eventually get used to the casting. Acting is quite good. Hope they make more.
4,"Pacing can be uneven, but a very good show","The title character is an Italian detective with an odd name (in fact, the name is a bit of a running gag, throughout the series). The series dwells on Italian politics and the presumption that everyone has that our hero is ""on the take,"" simply because he's a police officer. Of course, he ends up being put in difficult and morally ambiguous situations where he needs to choose between his choice to be ""clean"" and various greater goods.A fascinating and well written series. Uneven pacing is a small gripe, but it's definitely a valid one."
5,I love Rufus Sewell,"I couldn't believe this series was discontinued. The producers really missed the boat. Zen and Tania are such a great couple. I particularly like the understated nature of their conversation, and relationship."
3,Near Miss,"You take a fabulously expressive actor like Sewell and confine him to playing an oddly stoic, diffident character and you end up with a series that is cancelled after one season. The stories are solid and interesting. The setting is gorgeous. The actors are very good. Caterina Murino is intoxicating. Blame the direction."
5,great stuff,"not sure what the other reviewer was watching, this is a great series...very entertaining, give it a shot.just wish there were more episodes :)"
4,It's a pretty good toy,It's a pretty good toy. Legs and arms don't move alot and ears have funny color. But other than that the toy is perfect.
1,The private lives of pathologists,"I teach forensic science and grave excavation. I was hoping this tape would take me and the students into a morgue ""setting"" when we couldn't actually go. I liked the first 15 minutes of the tape, because it actually had to do with autopsy...but why did you have to do a background on the medical examiner's. We work in this environment too. We can't possibly think the public thinks so small that they wouldn't think M.E., police officers, etc. have no life but in the lab/morgue/streets? Do they? Anyway, I hoped the tape had more autopsy material, but it didn't."
2,Autopsy: Through the Eyes of Death Dectives,"Personnally, I thought it could of been in more detail. There were alot of discussions with Doctors, so I was disappointed in the video. I'm not certain as to what I really expected, but I didn't think it was going to be as much talking as there was."
5,Educational,Used this in the classroom and was very educational. Only complaint it was vhs so not as clear as dvds!
5,Excellent educational video,"This video is probably the best I have seen of autopsy videos for educational purposes... Provides a great view from different camera angles, and a thorough description that makes it easy to understand what is going on. Very tasteful and done with respect. A must see for all A&P and Advanced Physiology students."
4,Overlooked gem!,"Just got this on vinyl after having the MP3s. Don't think you can buy the LP through Amazon, but this is an overlooked piece of the mid-aughts ""freak folk"" movement... though this has a lot more melody than some of its contemporaries, & certainly some great, psych-*rock* fuzztones, cryptic lyrics & excellent arrangements. Glad I was turned on to it!"
2,"Watch broke, warranty worthless","I gave this watch to my wife. She's gotten a lot of compliments on its appearance. It's titanium and doesn't discolor her skin like other metals do.I was resetting the watch at the end of daylight time, and the crown fell off the flimsy stem. I returned the watch to St. Moritz under warranty, and they denied my warranty claim. I'm very disappointed in St. Moritz. They sold me this watch, but they won't sell me another."
4,Very nice watch,"When I finally received the watch I was surprised because the titanium bracelet has a different color from the picture. It's darker, but still looks great.The orange dial is so bright and beautiful.The bracelet has two little scratches, they are little so I don't think of change it, but they are there."
5,Like a heart-to-heart talk with a good friend,"Reading ""The Game Plan"" is like having a heart-to-heart talk with a friend who not only cares about your spiritual well-being, which sexual sin assaults, but who also has walked through that valley. Joe Dallas, an experienced Christian counselor, offers an honest, no-nonsense guide to restoration that is infused with straight talk about coming out of the darkness to become the men God created us to be. An excellent resource."
5,Amazing!,A great resource for anyone struggling. The author has been through more than most people and can actually provide advice from a realistic viewpoint. This is NOT another pray away your temptations style book that have was written by someone that thinks the have the answers even though they have never struggled themselves. This book is absolutely helpful!!!!!
3,Waaaay too easy for my 6 year old.,"I bought this puzzle based on some other reviews, thinking it might entertain my 6-year old son on an airplane ride. Unfortunately it was too easy for him and he lost interest quickly."
4,Spatterings of Southern Life,"The diverse plotlines presented in this collection of 34 short stories by Southern Writers it quite a treat. Having picked up the book for a Southern Literature class, I quickly realized how multifacted the southern living experience was. The stories cover a wide range of topics from family structure and interactions to chilling ghost tales to rowdy children and rebellious women. Well known authors like Edgar Allen Poe, Kate Chopin, and Zora Neale Hurston paint vivid pictures of the South and the types of people living not only days past, but in the contemporary South as well. Curl up in a blanket on your veranda and enjoy this taste of the south!"
3,worth it while it lasts,"i didn't realize that the casino one doesn't burp..it makes a chinging quarter machine noise, which is cool i guess.it works great for the first little while. then starts losing range."
5,One of the Raku Bibles,"This is one of the Bibles of the Raku art world. Piepenburg gives a great introduction into the history of Raku, where it originated, the Raku families, and the ties to the Japanese Tea Ceremony. Sprinkled throughout the book are excellent examples of Raku artwork from a variety of artists. A wide variety of shapes, forms, glazes, and techniques are all detailed and described. There is also a nice collection of glaze recipes along with application methods and testing techniques. There is a section that talks about Raku kilns and burners and some basic information on how to build them. Finally there is an introduction into the firing and post-firing techniques that are used in Raku. Overall it is a very nice introduction to Raku with a very nice gallery of pieces to inspire you to create your own works of art."
1,Horribly strong perfume smell,"After I wash my friends with this shampoo, I can't stand to be near them! the perfume odor of this product is overwhelmingly nauseating (I suspect our dog and cat don't like it much better than me). I don't want my friends to smell like a bottle of cologne was spilled on them. I want my friends to be, and smell clean!"
2,Oatmeal Shampoo,Not as natural of a product as I intended. Smells like pine-sol. Very disappointed. Does lather well. And I don't like being told how many words I need to leave in a review.
2,Very boring,I expected more from this video. It was boring as there is no dialogue to this video. The models did a nice job but I just wish there would have been voicing with the video
1,Background for a gay sauna,"Eros goes mad with self-importance as we watch writhing well-sculpted bodies and a little soft porn - well, a lot - done to music that has neither soul nor lyric. Nary a word of dialogue, you can get everything there is to get at ""fast-forward three"" stopping here and there for a glimpse of floppy bits or romantic gush if you will. This is the kind of thing they used to project on blank walls at gallery openings for artists of little talent outside the boudoir - and other than being a promo for other products of the studio of a more graphic nature, serves little purpose - particularly in a film library. Save your $$$ for something worth watching. If buy it you must, shop around the $1.00 bins; you can then recycle it without guilt."
4,Note! This grill does not have a ribbed surface!,"I was totally excited about purchasing this grill for my husband for Christmas. He has wanted one for a long time. After reading the reviews and product description, I knew this was the best at this price. However, I totally overlooked the fact that the grill surface is flat. The picture on this page shows the closed grill, and I just missed that detail in the description. As soon as I opened it from the Amazon box, I knew this would not work. I had to return it for the Hamilton-Beach version that has ribbed plates...a feature that my husband specifically asked for."
1,Beware,"Mine appears to have an internal electric ground fault. As I tried to plug in my brand new Breville panini maker, enough sparks flew to burn the end of the electric plug. I won't get a chance to find out how well this product does its job. It is going back."
1,"scam, only 1 bulb",Listing says pack of 6 but it is a lie. You are ordering 1 bulb. Why Amazon says pack of 6 when selling only 1 bulb must be intentional misrepresentation.
5,GREAT BUY!,"ok, i was told from alot of people that this is a great show and it really is! .hack//sign is a great show it is about a growing online game. it takes place in ""the world"" then when Tsukasa can not logout he is stuck in ""the world"" and is gratnted a misterious power. The show has great music and amation. the DVD contains eps. 1-5 and a preview for the great RPG video game. the goods are great to the shirt is XL so fits all. a grerat soundtrack, a cute stuffed animal of a kool animal in the game, and 4 postcards and a sticker sheet. and inclued to all dat u get a demo for the game. !WARNING! this show (from wat i have seen) is not dirty or violent it is mostly talking so if u like that kinda stuff get it if not stay away"
5,Cute and cheap!,"Even if the DVD will never be as the original Japanese one, I think it rocks. The box is very pretty and so are all the things inside it, for the price it has it's VERY cheap, I saw it elsewhere in $...! So it's a must buy and since just 15,000 are available, it will be very rare to find it later!"
2,Doesn't go ANYWHERE,"Well I'm sorry, but I don't know what the other reviewer was talking about. I've now seen through episode 11, and the plot hasn't moved anywhere since the 2nd episode. I have to give it to the creators though, the production aspect of the series is outstanding. From the visuals to the music, there are few series that come close to this. Even the main concept of the storyline is extremely interesting, and yet they failed to develop it in any way. I have never been so disappointed with a series, and find it very hard to want to continue watching further; a friend of mine has seen the entire series and says that it won't get any better. Therefore, I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 just because I could tell that there was a lot of effort put into the design of the series, just not much thought put into developing the plot. What a shame; .hack//sign had a lot of promise."
5,"Incredible, visually stunning ANIME!","The premise of the story is fun, engaging, captivating and brilliantly executed!Taking place mostly in an online / everquest-like world, combined with quick flashes to the 'real-world,' help to create characters with incredible depth that you grow to care about.It takes many twists and turns as you spiral towards an incredible ending... Which I can't tell you about, of course!The MUSIC and the animation are supurb! You'll want to go out and get the soundtrack ASAP (BT's theme) is my favorite. And who knew something called a ""grunty"" could become endearing!!! But it will--watch all 25 ephisodes!!! One of the best ANIME series I have ever come seen (and I own a ton)!"
2,bleh,"I bought this because I found nothing but awesome reviews. I love watching anime but I did NOT love this.I generally prefer watching dubs if they are good, but this just didn't do it for me. I think maybe if I stuck to watching this subbed, then it would not have been so bad. Probably.As for the action sequences, they show a bunch of them as they are about to start, and then before anything hits anything, cut to a scene where they talk about the fight or not at all. I don't really mind all the talking (love Witch Hunter Robin) but again, I ran into the dub issue. The acting just didn't work for me. Points for the DVD extras though."
2,Hack//signs is way too slow,"This series is extremely slow. I saw the whole japanese series I would say it was sorry. I really don't recomend this series to anybody. The whole series is all walking around and conversating about how to find a key and wonder why Tsukasa can't go back to the real world. This whole series is all dialogue. There is only like a couple fighting scenes near the end. It is so slow, I have never seen something so slow...If you want to be left opened at the end of the series be my guest and buy the whole series. One of my most pet peeve in this series is that there is alot of unneeded flash back. It was so bad that one of the chapter was just all flashback (what a waste of my time).Only reason I am not giving it a one star rating is the intro to the series is one of the best I have ever seen and also the soundtrack is [good]. I also love how the character design."
5,Wow,"It's hard to make sense of the series (especially in the beginning) without knowing some context from the PS2 games. Once you can figure out what's going on, it's easy to get into the show. This is a great show, but please, do some research first or you'll probably hate it."
1,BO-RING,".hack is nothing but hype. The animation and the game are sub-par; the story just makes me yawn. I have never been so bored in my life. I have been indulging in anime for years, but few have provoked this type of response from me. Honestly, it is laughable how marketing and advertising can push something. This is not a ground breaking title, in fact, nothing about the animation, style, music or plot stands out in my mind. Save yourself some time and money and avoid this travesty at all costs. Besides, Phantasy Star Online came first and would have made a much more interesting property. Get a modem and play an online game with REAL people."
2,Not worth the money....,I bought this at the recommendations of many of my friends and after reading several reviews. This is purely a character-driven story and only has one or two fights that are actually worth watching. All in all not up to the standards of a all-around good anime...
1,What series are you people watching ??????????,"Yes, the music is great and so is the art but the show is dull with poorly defined characters and a slow pace that could lull a hyperactive ten year old to sleep. This is one of the worst animes ever made ! I've seen some more episodes on Cartoon Network....it doesn't get any better, folks. Save your money and buy something good. CLAMP has out X (slow paced in the beginning but with gorgeous animation and a great story, and amazing characters), or Chobits (a light and fun series from CLAMP about a guy who finds a cute female robot in a dumpster and falls in love with her). You'll be MUCH better off taking my advice."
5,Great Item.,Great Series. I would really recommend this series to any fans of the Final Fantasy franchise. Overall art style and music are top notch.
4,want-to-be gardener,I bought this for my dad who is always trying to have a garden but it always flops. He enjoyed it and had a great garden this year.
3,"Interesting, but not great golf instruction","Though the tone of this book was pretty self-congratulatory, I did enjoy reading some of the details of Annika's golf career and how she keeps fit to play her best game. However, while I came away with a few interesting little tips, I don't think this is a great instruction book, at lease for the higher handicap player. The instruction on the basics is pretty superficial and while some of the drills look as if they could be helpful, there is not enough detailed explanation to ensure that the drills are performed correctly. I can see the book helping someone who already has a nice, free swing, but not so much the person who is trying to attain one."
3,"Pen Mark on ""Brand New"" Book","The book was in fine condition, although for being a brand new book sold by Amazon, there was an inch-long sharpie mark on the cover, as well on the bottom of the book. Since this was a Christmas gift, I was rather embarrassed."
5,Golf Annika's Way !,"Bought this book for my wife... My wife loves it, and enjoys that it explains golf theory in a positive style and has many many photos. I have gotten some great tips and thoughts from this book myself. An enjoyable read AAA+ Super book !"
5,Bobby Bare (way back then),"My dad had this album many years ago and I don't know who played it more, me or him? I was only 10 about the time and over the years, I had forgotten about the album but still parts of the songs would come to me at different times. And with that comes all the memories. Funny how music does that? Anyway, I remembered the album this week and now this completes my quest. Send it to me soon. Thanks, Mark Jeter."
3,Student Reviewer,"As Maggie Morrison grows up she has her share of good times and bad times. As Maggie matures into a young lady of 13 years, she buys her first bra. She discover that a best friend can also be a boyfriend. Maggie's world isn't a gentle or stable one. She moves from place to place and see different faces all the time. The only constant thing in her life is her emerging sense in herself. I thought that the book was kind of funny. I enjoyed it but I did not like the ending. It kind of just ended and left me hanging. It doesn't seem like an ending at all. I had a feeling that there was more to the story but they lost the ending of it and only published that much."
5,Great CD!,"The music on this CD is fun and thought provoking. I particularly like the song Somedays, but Maryann brings back a lot of memories. This is a CD that everyone can enjoy!"
3,The Electric Car...,"If you are looking to get your feet wet in the electric transportation field, this is a good start. It provides the fundamentals and concepts for a novice user to start to understand what is needed, and how parts work together. If you want to build an electric car, this is not the book for you."
4,Santa Esmerelda - House Of The Rising Sun,Songs Include : The House Of The Rising Sun / Quasimodo Suite / Dance You Down Tonight / Nothing Else Matters / Hey Gip
5,One of the greatest concerts recorded - EVER!!!,"For Pixies fans, this is a must. The concert footage from a 1988 UK show has to be one of the greatest concerts recorded. It shows how dedicated Charles, Joey, David and Kim are to their music. Kim looks hypnotized most of the time. David's drumming is close to perfect. Joey looks like he's afraid of the crowd. Charles is typical Black Frances; Mad at the world and laughing at it.The documentary, Gouge, is great. Not only does it provide you with details about the band, it demonstrates how influential the Pixies are to modern rock.The tour footage is okay. There's good spots, but they're in the middle of some very boring scenes.Last, the Videos. Pixies are not known for ""show"", and these videos show that. None of them are really worth watching, to be quite honest, but Veloria provides you with a few panty shots of Kim, which isn't too bad (though this is probably one of the worst videos ever)."
2,Radiohead sucks,"The Pixies undoubtedly are one of the most influential, musically fantastic bands ever. Influenced Radiohead, Nirvana, Weezer as well as bunch of indie bands, NOT the other way around. But the DVD is no good. Frank Black is an incredible musician and showman, blasting through 3 hour sets of more than 50 songs, without taking a break between a single one. The DVD shows him touring early on, where he sings with an awkward presence not unlike a talent show performance. The music videos aren't great. Low budget music videos that are more interested in video effects than the music or the band. Save your money and go see them live. Even if you don't get to see the Pixies, at least go see Frank Black, he still performs the old Pixies songs, and with a much tighter band, the Catholics."
4,Small but clear Dell display,"I picked this TV up for our bedroom because we didn't have a lot of wall space that could reasonable fit a wall mounted TV between the end posts of our four poster bed. The DELL W2306C seemed to be a good size, with reasonable specs and a great price.I was very surprised to see that this TV had more inputs than my 60"" plasma TV! It has great picture quality, especially with HD and component inputs and the sound was quite clear for what I was expecting. I found a VESA compliant wall mount and had this guy up on my wall in a day.The remote control is full featured and the display itself is quite sexy. I found myself wondering if I should buy another one for a desk display for my computer!All in all, I was very pleased with this product. For the price, I couldn't beat its response time, luminosity or interface features."
4,BOTONOIL SHAMPOO,"IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND BOTANOIL SHAMPOO LATELY.THE BOTTLES THAT I BOUGHT FROM AMAZON HAVE A PALE GREEN BOTTLE COLOR,RATHER THAN WHITE. THE TEXTURE SEEMS DIFFERENT, BUT IT'S STILL OK. I JUST WONDERED WHYIT WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I USED TO PURCHASE AT THE STORE?JCL"
2,Substandard Product,"Here is the timeline of this product:After first two plays, little wood pieces starting chipping off;In about two weeks, the pictures starting peeling off;In about one month, layered wood started falling apart.Will I still buy puzzles from this company? Maybe, no one else selling small puzzle set for toddlers. What choice do I have? But I do pray to God that somebody will be making a better product soon and drive Melissa & Doug out of business."
3,disappointed,"I have been a huge fan of Melissa and Doug toys for some time now. Lately, however, I have been disappointed a few times. This is one of several toys that the picture is peeling off. I have put a thin layer of thin glue over the edges of several pieces to make it lay back down and stay on. It also seems the pieces are made of an extremely thin wood which peels in some places. I really wish that i could continue to be super impressed with this company."
5,Fun Puzzle,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my three-year-old grandson, who loved the puzzle and had no difficulty putting it back together. The quality is good, and the wood puzzle is much sturdier than a cardboard one."
5,Melissa & Doug Construction Site Jigsaw,"The grandson loves jigsaw puzzles and this one is perfect for him, it has four in one box and they are all construction vehicles. Made of wood, they are made to last a long time, especially with THIS grandson."
1,Pieces are peeling,"The wooden pieces are peeling off the front and the back. We have other puzzles that are just fine, but this one doesn't seem to be any good."
5,Great quality and perfect for little fingers,"My 3 yr old grandson is just now starting to enjoy puzzles. I purchased this toy as a Christmas present for him and its one he needs very little help with. I think after a few times of putting it together he will need no help at all. You may think after a few times a child would get tired of it........nope, does not happen. I taught Kinder for many years and the children loved the wood tray puzzles and would work them over and over again. I think it has to do with, ""I can do it all by myself"". So many toys today break right away (just junk), but the wooden puzzles don't. Have purchased many of the Melissa & Doug toys and have not been disappointed yet. The tray to keep this in makes it even nicer. The pieces fit togther nice and tight too. This is the first M & D Jigsaw puzzle I have purchased, and it will not be the last."
5,3 yr old loves it,My three year old really enjoys puzzles and he loves trucks so this puzzle worked out well. I would definitely recommend this product.
3,Quality doesn't worth the price,"This is a good puzzle. My 3 year old loves it. But, quality is so poor that it doesn't seem to worth the price. I could get 4 of the similar puzzles in a box for almost the same price from a local store (TJX) and they are from Melissa and Doug too."
4,A decent starter puzzle,A decent starter puzzle. Would give it 5 stars if the image was also imprinted on the frame so that our son (age 2) could use it as a guide to match the pieces as he tries to put it back together.
5,Great Melissa and Doug Puzzle,I bought this puzzle for my 2 year old who loves vehicles. We have several Melissa and Doug 12 pc. puzzles and this one is his favorite.The puzzle is durable and he can complete it independently.
3,Merry Magic for grandson,Bought this magic set for my grandson for Christmas. He likes it just fine but has trouble with some of the tricks as he is only 8.
3,"Discolored, but vet approved","All of the kabobs in my order had dark spots and a grayish tinge to them. I've been buying this toy for my bird for over a decade and this was the first time I'd seen so much discoloration. I took a sample to my vet; he did not find any mold, and found only small traces of a common bacteria that he said he considered to be safe. My bird chews them just as readily as those that are of a normal color so I guess they're OK, they just look strange."
1,Poor Planning,It's difficult to tell if my birds would like to shred the balls because the cord is twine and both my cockatoos had the balls on the cage floors within minutes. They really need to use chains or something more indestructible.
5,"OK product, GREAT customer service","Some kit builders have technical issues with how this kit is designed. It WILL drift depending on various factors. If you want a rock solid signal, get the Ramsey FM25B. I needed some parts to finish this kit after making a few mistakes and the tech support staff was very helpful in helping me figuring out what I needed. Keep in mind you won't get this kind of service if you order from a non-Ramsey reseller. For me its worth a few bucks extra. I will also say when I bought this kit it was cheaper on shipping to get it from Amazon than it was from Ramsey's own site."
2,You pay for what you get.,You pay for what you get. It was very easy to build. Nice little project. One problem. The frequencies slightly moves. +/- 0.1MHz over time making you chase it around the dial every few hours.
1,FM Transmitter,That was unfortunately a piece of junk. Don't waste your money on it.Customer service was lacking too. It's already in the trash bin for a while.
3,TR-Chronicles Has Excellent Plot,"The Rome, Ireland, and Russia sections of Tomb Raider: Chronicles are excellent; the VCI Headquarters would be, were it Bug free. I enjoyed the plot and many of the puzzles. In order to gain height I did have to unlearn the monkey swinging technique mastered in the previous game, but the new forward summersault (flip) from an elevated cranny was delightful, as were the parallel bar swinging and tightrope walking.On the PS-2 this might be a 5 star game; however, on the PC the last section is so bug-filled that it is very frustrating. Tonight I finished all the levels with all the secrets for the second time; this time without having to cheat or download replacement levels in order to work around the bugs. Said bugs are usually caused by saving in the wrong place."
3,Tomb Raider: Chronicles,"Tomb Raider Chronicles is the fifth Lara Croft adventure game created on the TR4 built engine. Compared to TR4 it is a very short game. There are thirteen levels with four adventures set in Rome, Russia, An Ireland adventure with 16 year old lara and the final adventure in the Vci headquaters building. The graphics are quite dated. The storyline is good and the gameplay is very good and not as hard as TR4. Challenging puzzles with no annoying false paths, But the boss levels are very hard. Level design is good and not in hub layout so no confusing backtracking. Each level has three secret golden roses and if you find all of them you will be given special access. The controls are the same and still not perfect and as usual no difficulty option. Compared to the fourth game chronicles has a very good and less confusing gameplay but it is very short and looks like an expansion pack to TR4 than a brand new Tomb Raider game."
4,Get ready to be Crofted,"The reason why I bought this game is because I went to see Lara Croft Tomb Raider ( thats a great movie, see it). I loved the movie and i knew the games rule. The first game i bought was tomb raider chronicles. its great, the graphics were brilliant, and she has cool weapons. The stories were good, and it will keep you busy for hours. Please get this game and all the others. She is soooooooo cool. Be sure to get Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness, coming this November"
5,The best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Well i want to say that all people in their reviews write about how short and how difficult this game is!If you asked me i woulde answered that this game is really the best of the tomb raider games!!!!!!!!!!!!The plot is fantastic and the graphics are very good either.I really enjoyed the levels with the teenage lara and vci headquartets.Sub levels were very good and in rome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I think all tomb raiders are ok but this one is the best.the levels aren't so confusing like in the other tr games and you don't get bored!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Too many bugs!,"Okay... the first few levels were fun, especially the level with the teenaged Lara in one of her first adventures. However, ""Red Alert"" has so many bugs in it that I finally gave up playing in despair. I've never given up on a game before, but this was finally more frustrating than fun."
1,TOMB RAIDER CHRONICLES,"I GAVE THE GAME ONLY ONE STAR, BECAUSE I HAVE NOT OPENED THE BOX IT CAME IN. I ORDERED THIS ITEM FOR THE COMPUTER BY MISTAKE; I SHOULD HAVE ORDERED IT FOR PLAYSTATION ONE; SO NOW I HAVE TO RETURN IT, FOR MY SON DOES NOT HAVE A COMPUTER AT HIS HOME. MY GOOF UP, NOT ANYBODY ELSES."
4,Not Bad,I liked the game but it was short. Another two or three worlds would have been nice. I loved the level editor it was very easy and enjoyable.
1,not worth the money,"I bought this for my 15 year old son and he said that all it did was weigh down the ball and make 2 out of 32 kicks but with the other tee, he made 18 out of 20 kicks"
3,Did not include a tee,Item showed a tee and a question if you wanted a second tee for an addition fee. One would think a tee as included. When called they said they should have indicated tee not included. Too bad
4,"If you have to read SK, this is how you should do it.","Let's be honest, SK is not the easiest of all reads. This collection makes it not only bearbale but enjoyable to wade through. Any person could read what SK is saying and in a lot quicker time than reading his works."
5,splendid!,"""You only get what you pay"" but in this case it ain't true--I consider this recording as very engrossing!"
4,You get what you pay for. Worth buying for a novice.,"I have no major complaints about this product. For someone who simply wants to increase shelf space, DVD recording is the best way to go. Samsung has a decent product here if your looking to record television programs or movies.I do agree with 1 customer that the audio does occasionally fall out of sync with the video, but not always. Most notable when a character is speaking at the speed of someone on a caffiene rush! I recommend purchasing a better quality dvd recorder if you feel this is a problem for you. I'm satisfied for my purchase thus far. It beats VHS recording any day."
1,There are better recorders to be had for the same or lesser price,"In a nutshell, the three main reasons to avoid this unit:1) It's a cheapo DVD recorder & player which suffers from lagging, skipping, etc.2) The picture quality is horrible3) It broke after recording 2 discs.On top of this, the unit smells like burnt plastic, and the video has crazy interference. It's junk... go with a better brand.On the bright side, it's cheap, it finalizes discs really fast (1 minute), it has an on screen editor for track titles. It does *not* do video titling though."
1,Won't last the full year,I bought this recorder about 10 months ago or maybe less. I don't use it often about 3 times a month and already it doesn't work. It might come cheap but it won't last long.
3,Would love it if it worked!,"I bought two from Best Buy on Black Friday, and both gave me a ""System Error"" when recording over 30 minutes. One dvd I recordered and finalized worked in the unit, but played very SLOWLY (not normal speed) on a regular later model dvd player. I loave all the inputs (dv, and Svideo), and have not found anything in this price range with the features. I am very frustrated! My doel was the DVD-R120 AXAA (I did not try the XAA). AXAA was built in sept 05 and had the latest firmware (2.5). The XAA model was built earlier in the year, but not sure if they might work. Hope this helps someone... It would be a great unit if it worked as advertised."
2,system error!,"I was initially impressed with the features and functionality of this machine and it appeared to work well. Then when I got about 3/4 of the way through the first DVD-R disk, recording stopped and ""system error..."" appeared on the screen and everything I recorded was lost. Second DVD- same thing happened, third and fourth- same failure. So this machine has a 0-4 record. I was using Sony DVDs that work fine with my JVC DR-MV5S (which incidentally works well and I recommend) so I must conclude there is something wrong with the Samsung. I'll definitely be returning it."
3,New User Of This Product,"I have only had this product for 2 weeks and I am somewhat new to DVD player/recorders. So, take my comments with a grain of salt.The remote control will work with various TV brands when you program your TV brand code into it. But, it seems to ""forget"" the code after only a few minutes. You end up needing to re-program your TV brand code into the remote over and over agiain for the remote to work on your TV.Other than that everything seems to work ok. The picture quality after recoring from a VHS tape is good and actually appears a bit cleaner than the original tape.The directions are somewhat lengthy and the unit takes a few moments to ""load"" before you can operate it. That can be frustrating for those of us in a constant hurry.All and all I'd say the unit is average to better than average considering the price point."
1,The worst ever! Please don't buy this!,"I've had this Samsung DVD recorder over a year and it's been nothing but trouble. The power button on the remote wouldn't work out of the box, it's SUPER SLOW in opening & closing and playback is below VCR quality. TERRIBLE BUY!"
2,No Time Shift,"Unlike what Amazon's description says, this unit has no time shift or time warp feature. Returned it when I realized this. I purchased the Panasonic DMR-ES20S instead as it has this feature."
1,Out of sync!,"I bought one of these about 18 months ago. I *think* the first coupla dubs I made were OK, but then I noticed audio and video were out of sync. I thought it was me for the longest time (I'll spare you why) until two weeks ago. Then I did tests that absolutely confirmed it was the product. At that point I did what I should have done a long time ago, which is check user reviews for ""Samsung"" and ""out of sync."" Lights up like a Christmas tree.This product is worthless and the company ought to have the decency to remove it from the market or at least inform its customers of the problem. Would never recommend to anyone."
1,Disks do not play on other video players,"The disks recored on this player will not play on other players or a computer drive. This is a major problem for me since I bought the machine with this in mind. Should have read reviews first. However, other than that limitation the device works well, I've only tried it in 2 hour mode so far. The functions and set up are very easy."
1,Worst DVD player.,"Owned this for about 3 years and in that time:1) about 25% of the DVDs that I've burned on my PC would not play on this. The rest would play fine. The DVDs would work on otherplayers perfectly. Why? Don't know.2) the loading tray can take as long 20 seconds to open. You push the button, and then just wait and wait and wait. Then it plays gameswith you because while you wait you start thinking that maybe you didn't push the button hard enough so you push it again. Then itopens but with half a second closes before you can grab your disc.3) The player would sometimes not play rental DVDs. Not the DVD's problem, it would play on another player just fine.4) The recorder didn't work right. Movies that the player records would not play on other players.5) Do you really need any more reasons to avoid this?"
1,Device hangs up - unacceptable!!,"I've found that when I try to make a DVD from a home movie VHS tape and the tape has blank, unrecorded sections on it, the Samsung DVD-R120 will freeze the video going to my TV, although the audio continues. Then when I press Stop on the remote, the unit displays ""Wait"" forever until I unplug it. I find that a hang condition such as this on any consumer electronic device to be unacceptable and I will be returning the device to the store for a refund."
3,"Started off good, but fading","Overall, the DVD-R120 is pretty good, but there is one problem that is frustrating me to no end. I'm sure this is not a problem in all units because if it was no one would buy the thing.If I record onto a disc and then the unit is either turned off or turns itself off (which it will do when in Timer mode), prior to Finalizing, then the disc will be unreadable by the unit when you power it back on. You get an error code 0507 with some additional cryptic text and the DVD becomes garbage.I have burned through about 10 discs testing this thing out and trying to identify the problem and I finally have. Now I just need to contact Samsung and figure out what to do. I have already applied firmware and flash updates but it didn't help.I'm giving three stars because I like the unit and I can successfully burn discs as long as I don't power it off before finalizing. I'm sure this problem is specific to my unit because I can't find anything on google that refers to my problem."
1,DVD -R's should not be disposable,"We have had this unit for a little over a year - and we have to spend over $100 to have it repaired for its ""system error"" It has always been a little quirky to use and now it is just useless.Off I go to purchase another and not a Samsung this time."
2,Not recommended for converting Hi-8 home movies,"Already owning a Tivo, my primary reason for purchasing the DVD-R120 was to convert 8 years worth of Hi-8 camcorder video to DVD-R. While this unit is capable of that , the quality of the recording on DVD is worse than the original Hi-8 video tape. Specifically, in palces where the original pans across a scene, or shows any kind of motion, the resulting DVD recording is jittery and sometimes blocky. It is very distracting. This occurs even with XP recording mode (the highest quality mode - ~1 hour for a regular DVD).On the plus side: the fan on the back is very quiet (inaudible really), and setting up to record to DVD from the camcorder is very straightforward."
2,IF SHARING DVDS BEWARE,"OVERALL UNIT WORKS FINE.IF YOU WANT TO PLAY RECORDED DVDS IN THE SAMSUNG R120 AND USE ALL THE FEATURES YOUR FINE.IF YOU PLAY RECORDED DVD FROM THIS UNIT ON OTHER DVD PLAYERS YOU CANNOT FAST FORWARD,REVERSE,FREEZE FRAME,SKIP CHAPTERS ETC...THE DISC WILL FREEZE AND YOU WILL NEED TO EJECT.CALLED SAMSUNG{GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE SUPPORT} AND THEY SAID THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH NO FIX AT THIS TIME.RETURNED UNIT."
1,Misrepresentation,"Amazon mispresented this product. If you look at the actual package picture, it says it is a seasoning. It is not a marinade. What was sent does not compare favorably to McCormick's original McCormick Fajita Marinade. I don't like the seasoning product and cannot use it. Please do not misrepresent the product."
5,their best,"HUGE 16 Horsepower fan here. (I prefer ""fanatic."") I own all of their albums up until their dissolution and have listened to them several times each. Actually, I revere them so much that I try to limit my listenings of their albums so they always retain something fresh for me.Anyhow, I think ""Folklore"" was their best ever, among many good ones. It was the most stylistically coherent and the most musically accomplished. I don't think their music was ever more finely perfected than here.So if you've been hearing about 16 Horsepower and are undecided which one to get, I would urge you to start with this one."
2,mediocre,"Although I'm a big fan of 16 horsepower, I was really disappointed by this release. I did not find a single song on this cd to be very strong or memorable, though the other positive reviews led me the believe that this was one of their best, and darkest cds. By ""darkest"" I was hoping the reviewers also meant the hard hitting, nail bitingly powerful songs like some of the ""dark"" songs on his other cds. Not so. It wasn't exactly a horrible cd, just not something I'll waste my time listening to very much. If you're new to 16 HP start out with Low Estate or Sackcloth n' ashes, and don't judge this great band by one bad cd."
5,Head low and smoking,"I, like many it seems, was a little reserved when I first gave Folklore a listen. But it quickly grew on me the more I listened. It almost feels like a storytelling session. Edwards mixes traditional with new so well that it's impossible to decipher the two. He has the keen ability to make Hank Williams the most depressing artist of our time, while at the same time put a kick in my feet with a nice traditional French round. Hutterite Mile starts the album of nicely. Play it real loud in your car while you drive late at night down a deserted farm road and it's a spinetingling feeling. Edwards uses his unique voice to the best of his abilities here, and the results are yet again amazing and wholly reinventive."
3,Anti-Catholic,"I have to agree with the one-star reviewer, although I did give it 3 star because there ARE other really good, classic book recommendations in this resource. However, being Catholic myself, I also found several books, mainly in the high school and high school biography sections, that were blatantly anti-Catholic. I believe the authors should have really thought this out before recommending those particular books. Needless to say, I definitely won't have my children read those."
1,Promises not delivered,"Boy, didn't they mess this one up big time! Using real porn stars is smart, but why can't we hear any of their voices? Tommy Cruise stars as a nerd going to a clothes optional gay inn ... to read books, only to meet a popular jock stud. The sex scenes are typical, nothing too arousing. I found myself fast-forwarding the rental disc at netflix.com intermittenly until the end credits."
1,Location-5; Story-1,"After having stayed a week at Inn Exile I was interested in purchasing this dvd as a kind of souvenir of my very enjoyable stay! Scenery and setting aside, one could barely attempt to embarrass more completey and waste more greatly the talents of the cast. No talk, minimal action, uninteresting pairings. But Inn Exile and Palm Springs provide an extraordinary setting for pedestrian porn."
5,It rocks!,"This is a solid buy. Works well, cheap, I've very happy with it. Wish I had just read the great reviews on it and bought it rather than having looked at alot of other models and wasted time. Get it, and you'll be happy. Now go outside and enjoy your day."
5,Breville cordless kettle,"Absolutely fabulous. I was spoiled by this kettle (in 220v version) while living in London and was delighted to find a 110v version. It is heavy and does get hot, but it is very quick to heat water and looks good enough to keep on the countertop. Great product."
3,great kettle....,"poor lid design. The kettle works great, but the lid hinge broke after just a few months. Breville has excellent customer service and replaced it with a different model. This one I believe is discontinued."
3,A Big Disappointment,"After looking around for the best looking electric kettle that boils water quickly as well as holds at least 2 liters of water (1.9) in the case of this kettle, I finally decided to get the Breville Nova cordfree. There are many positive reviews that I agree with their praise of the kettle's performance, however, I have not read a review that brings to the fact, that once the water boils, the outside surface of the kettle is DANGEROUSLY HOT. The fact that the pot is stainless steel with no insulation barrier is cause for concern, especially if you have small kids that run the chance of burning themselves badly if they happen to touch it. I would now consider a platic based kettle over a stainless steel one.I boiled the first pot and that was it. I dried it up, packed it, and sent it right back to Amazon.I rate this kettle 5-Stars for looks and functionality and 2-Stars for safety for an overall 3-Star rating."
2,Big problem - surface way too hot,"This is unacceptable because the exterior surface gets far too hot. Some reviewers have suggested simply keeping it out of th reach of children. I disagree - this is not sufficient. For anyone using it, pouring hot water out of it, an unaware guest, and even regular user, it is too easy to accidntally touch the surface and it is extremely hot, you can even get a blister from it. Too bad the manufacturer couldn't figure out a solution - perhaps an insulating layer within, to allow the attractive metal surface without the scaldingly high heat."
3,Bucket of Animals,"I bought this as a stocking stuffer for the kids, I was a little dissapointed that it is 5 sets of the same 12 animals.. not a lot of variety, but the kids seem to like playing with them.."
4,A Gift for a 2.5 Year Old,"He loves playing with these. I like that there are multiple figures of the same animal, so he can practice sorting, etc. The ostrich doesn't stand up well, but that's really my only complaint!"
2,Poor workmanship!,I wouldn't recommend it if you wanted to have good replicas of the animals. The workmanship on these pieces leaves a lot to be desired but guess its a good deal for the price.
5,Awesome,bought this set for my 3 year old and he loves it he loves the animals and its not that small for him to choke on its good quality
3,Smaller than anticipated,"These where a lot smaller than anticipated. My daughter already had a zebra that measured 3"" so I figured they where closed to the same size. These were half the size of her 3"" zebra."
3,Review,Some of the animals were bent and wouldn't stand upright. Most were ok. It is fairly cheap so worth the money. My daughter likes playing with them.
5,Great fun!,"I almost did not buy them because of one review said they look cheap. Actually, they are not. They look pretty real. My 3-year old had great fun with them. He has a lot of match box cars. These animals are small enough to put on tops of them. So he could move them from one place to the other. They give toddlers somethings to imagine."
2,"cheap animals, made in china..","Small plastic animals, as a genre, are an excellent toy. My daughter spends a lot of time playing with hers. I ordered these thinking we could do with a few more. But they seem very cheaply made. I sent them back. I recommend you get a couple of Toobs instead -- or, better by far, invest in some Playmobil."
5,Great value,We love these jungle animals. We use them instead of counting bears for a lot of math projects for my preschool aged children. They provide hours of creative play. Wonderful toy.
2,Fun but small,"My daughter likes to play with them anyway, but for the price these should have been much bigger. We get better ones that are bigger and not all in the same pose at the dollar store."
3,Not what I expected!,"I purchased the learning resources fish and animals. The arrived in just a few days, I was so excited to see them and when I opened the box I was a little bit upset when I seen them! I guess I should have looked at the information on them a little better but these are very small! (can fit inside my 2 year olds hand completely! There are 6 of each animal I believe they do seem to be made very good so far and all of the animals actually stand up with out a problem which is a big thing for us here because my child does not like it when he can not get toys to stand. Also when we 1st opened them the had a VERY strong paint smell coming of from them. Over all the kids still enjoy them and I think they were a ok buy."
3,Marx's Concept of Money,"An unsympathetic and largely disingenuous trawl through Marx's writings on money that seems hell bent on proving him wrong at all costs, only to leave the reader with no viable alternative. Little attempt is made to engage with the pressures of the present that prompt us to interrogate the meaning of value, which leaves the whole project of the book isolated. Too often the same points are repeated in sequential paragraphs. In summary the tone is hostile and the project destructive."
4,book: cooking alaska,"This item was purchased as a gift and shipped directly to the receiver, therefore I never saw it. The receiver is happy with the book."
1,"Samsung DVDN2000's Audio, Features and Service FAIL!!","The DVD player WILL NOT play audio in bitstream mode during menu's, deleted scenes and special features. This is the biggest problem I have encountered, making this DVD player worthless to anyone with a surround sound system using Fibre-Optic or Digital Co-axial connections. The Snapshot mode does not save changes, as advertised. The Angle view does not update the thumbnails, as advertised. Of the 100 DVD's I own, not one of them will play audio during Analog 2X Scan Audio mode, as advertised. Samsung's service Rep's do not return calls or e-mails and the Authorized service center told me they can't fix it, ""It's not broken, that's how it's designed."""
1,Major dissapointment,"The only good thing I can say about this program is that the graphics look good and it did put single missions in the right place with CFS2. Unfortunately, most of it does not work well. For example, when bombing a Japanese carrier I almost landed on the deck before release and yet no damage to either carrier or plane. The program comes with a floppy that is supposed to fix all these bugs. It does not! When I went back to CSF2, I discovered that CSF2 was corrupted to the extent that that I had to remove CSF2 and reinstall it again before CSF2 was working again. I think that I will jsut wait until CSF3 and CSF4 come out. I do not plan to ever use the Midway program again."
2,Not a fully debugged product,"Installed quicky over a clean install of CFS2. Several missions had major bugs including planes that would not start and missing library files. Other missions were impossible to end even when the mission goals were met (warp disabled) unless you flew manually back to base. Additional problems when you tried to change payload from the default. A frustrating experience, especially when I found no patches at Abacus' website."
2,waste of time & money,"I found this video a waste of time & money. I have found better joint mobility instruction for free on the internet. Certainly Steve Maxwell's dvds, and even Matt Furey's are much better."
2,If you have Geforce 4............. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!,"I have a new computer with a Geforce 4 video card, and this game will not play properly. It will not give you the reticle for the weapons, or some of the other neat stuff. Not worth a dime if you cannot see where you are shooting.I have tried several times to find a patch, but no luck thus far. If you have an older card, then it looks like a pretty fun game.I played the demo for IGI2 and that is why I bought this one. IGI2 is an awesome game, but if you cannot see where your gun is aiming, then forgt it."
4,No comparison with EIDOS Tombraider series...,"Ya know, I think that people who play the TombRaider series get spoiled... I love TombRaider but, it ruined me for some of the lesser games. This one has great graphics but it's unbelievable how much empty space there is! You sneak into buildings that have absolutely nothing of gaming value... No First Aid or health boxes to recover - that's the biggest flawe I found... And, you can't save the game anywhere!!! So, you go on until you finally get killed and have to start all over again. I hate that! At times it's just too damned slow in reaction time and that's truly annoying... Again, you shoot the Nazi and he falls down and then gets up to shoot again! Ridiculous..."
3,PROJECT IGI,"ALTHOUGH GRAPHICS AND STORY LINE ARE GOOD, THE DESIGNERS FAILED MISERABLY WHEN DESIGNING THIS GAME. THERE IS NO WAY TO SAVE GAME AS YOU PROGRESS, ONCE YOU ARE DEAD, YOU HAVE TO RESTART MISSIONS OVER AND OVER EXTREMELY BORING AND REDUNDANT MORE THOUGHT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT INTO THIS GAME AS FAR AS PLAYABILITY"
2,"no savegame, what on earth where they thinking....","or like the AI they weren't...The other reviewers describe the good points quite well. But it will always come back to this: THERE IS NO SAVEGAME, not even a checkpoint after a completed object. This must have been requested by the QA department and whoever decided not to listen should be fired."
4,"While the game is not out, there is a demo...","While others may feel that since the game is not released it is to early to write a review, I have played the demo and in my experience the demo is a pretty good indicator of a game.While I usually find Eidios games to fall short of quality games due to the UI, this game was different. It is solid. The game engine runs better than most 3d shooter games. The best way to describe this game is a James Bond version of Thief or Thief II. You sneak around performing tasks such as stealing a truck etc. The weapons are very realistic, the graphics are great and the game is fun.I would highly recommend giving the demo a try. My only gripe would be the lack of multiplayer. A game called Venom which will be released next year or later looks a lot like this game but with co-op multiplayer. So prep up with IGI and get ready for Venom"
4,One of the best games ever made,"This is a ""you better go and get the game"" game. i have the game and its like swat 3 and doom put together.so if you dont have the game go and get it,its about $40.oo.so go and get it k? i give it a 4 stars out of 5 stars.thats how good it is"
2,Save your cash...,"This game is one of the worst shooter games I've played within the last 10 years.I cannot stress enough on how bad this thing is. Others have covered the details on why it's so schitty. The AI is very dumb. You can execute someone and the person in the next room just keeps on smoking like they never heard a thing.The bad guys respawn endlessly, but your ammo does not. It may take you 30 minutes or more to get to a certain point, only to be killed by some cheap hip shot from 1/2 a mile away. Have fun starting all over again.Save your cash and buy Ghost Recon or Call of Duty."
3,Don't buy until you can save,"Great graphics, but poorly planned - The engine works well most of the time. There are a few glitches where dead soldiers re-appear if you step in the wrong place. The weapons and action are realistic and thrilling. The big disappointment is there is no way to save the game! Even the patch that's out is too complicated for non-computer folks to figure out. Unlike other titles, the scenes tend to get a little repetitive. Once you've been in some of the buildings, you feel like you are back in them again in the next mission."

2,she's not so great,"while her poetry isn't the worst i've read, graham's isn't that great... her poems drag on, all could be cut by about half or even a third. she seems to forget just what the english language can do in the hands of a master, because her poems are flat and i've heard of people talking about her work being difficult. i think they confuse difficult with nothing to say."
3,Experience Side Effects,"I can't really tell how effective these lozenges are since I don't feel any different after taking them. The taste is ok. I do get a slight headache and feel lethargic afterwards even on a full stomach. For that reason, I'm hesitant about continuing."
5,Wonderful quick resource book!,Was visiting my sister in Canada over Labour Day and she pulled this book off the shelf for a quick look on how to speed up the mango ripening process. It worked and we enjoyed reading portions of the book out loud to each other. When I got home I ordered copies for myself and my prospective daughter-in-law. They arrived quickly and I have enjoyed mine...esp reading up on how to keep ginger fresh! I can see that it will really come in handy!
5,Great for Beginners,"I borrowed this book from my local library and looked through it and realized that I had to have a copy of my own. It is a book with very clever ideas on using kitchen equipment, fruits, veggies, you name it. It even has answers to questions that I've always wondered about like.....Why will potatoes and onions spoil more quickly if you store them together?I like to cook more now because I'm more informed about foods, utensils and equipment. This would be a great wedding shower gift for any young woman starting her own family and who isn't very experienced in the kitchen. I don't know if it would be useful for more experienced cooks because I'm not one. Hopefully that helps."
4,Informative,Book is extremely informative as to methods of cooking and tips to prepare food properly
4,"How to break an egg, review","This Book has wonderful charts of cooking times and pages of illustrations ""HOW TO..."". Good tips how to fix food. Overall an excellent book.Advise how to condition Cast Iron Equipment is very dated and should beupdated. Newest scientific findings how Flaxseed Oil, 500 baking for 2 hours, repeat of same, results in molecularly bonded coatings many times tougher than the old method's.Good educational reading."
2,WASTE OF MONEY,"Too stiff, doesn't lay down easily and tabs don't stay in. Sorry I purchased this item"
1,Do NOT Buy!,Do NOT Buy if you want to use it for chrome wire shelving. Reasons: [1] thin flimsy plastic; [2] slippery surface; [3] tabs don't work. I would not recommend this product.
3,I use this software fairly frequently....,"This is not the most user friendly software, nor is the documentation easy to follow or complete. However, I found that by trial and error, starting with the manual, I could get it to work. It does sometimes lock up and is very sensitive to how you push the buttons and how fast and in what order. If you take it slow and learn what each button does and how it works, it can download music, and allow you to edit and save the files. The time shifting feature also works. The software is very tempermental, however. There is a new version out which I have not tried, it may be better."
1,this product is awful,first it repeatedly kept telling me i was using it for frist time. after repeated use.then it would not record using the timer.no tech support for the product exists.don't waste your money on this product.
2,Reads like an advertorial,"I was disappointed with this book -- it read as if the writer had paid sponsorships from the places he reviewed. Plus, despite its promise of including hikes, hikes were barely mentioned, but plenty of advertising was provided for local tour companies. The book isn't a complete waste of time, but if you're looking for a guide that spends time discussing the area in depth and doesn't just review the local businesses, don't buy this one."
1,Muffin Pan bad wrap/beware of the company selling them,"This review is not for the muffin pan but the people who sold it. I had to give this muffin maker one star because I could not try it, but in all fairness the one star is for the seller and not necessarily the item. My son bought this for me because it was on my wish list, I could not wait for it to arrive and when it did boy what a dissappointment when I noticed it was broken and appeared to be a return because it was not packaged like it would have been were it factory direct. When my son called about returning it he was told they don't carry it anymore so tough luck. They said they would refund his money but now I have no muffin maker well I do but it is broken and it appears they are still selling them on this site, the same one only a few dollars more. My advise is buyer beware..."
4,muffins everyday,I love this product. It is small so it doesn't take up the whole counter. The only reason I don't give it a 5 rating is that it seems to take longer to cook than it says.I truely do use it about 3 times weekly.
5,Makes great muffins!,"The person who wrote the review about muffins not rising is doing something wrong. My first batch-with my own recipe using self rising flour (can also use baking powder & soda)-produced luscious, perfectly baked muffins. Muffin maker heats up quickly-just a couple minutes. Most recipes take about 15 minutes to bake. I plan to use this to make muffins, muffin shaped scones, cupcakes, small cakes and mini pies.This is a great time saver for singles and couples. Make a batch and save extra batter for next batch."
1,Gummy Muffins,"The inside of the muffins come out gummy no matter how long you cook them. The texture of the muffin is terrible. The outside will burn while the inside remains gummy & sticky. Plus the outside of the appliance is very, very hot. It does warn you, but I have never felt a stand alone appliance this hot to the touch. So hot it should not be near anything on the counter."
1,Bad news!,Item was not packaged properly and was broken in shipment. Could not get any response from seller!Had to contact Amazon direct. They were very good and did credit my credit card for this item. Very pleased with Amazon's action.Charles & Sanny Sue
1,Failed attempt also,"I just tried the exact same muffin mix {Krusteaz} and low fat banana. HORRIBLE. I don't know if it is the mix or the muffin magic. The reviews are what sold me on it so I will try it again. I followed the instructions exactly, oiled the cups, waited for ready light; muffins looked great, golden brown on outside but raw on inside and tough."
1,Movie?,"This is not a movie, it's porn. If you want a bad movie with bad acting, bad casting, bad music, bad everything and a story that could be told in 3 minutes then here it is. It's a hour long porn flick, so if that's what you want this is it."
3,hokus pokus jokers card come take a spin on carnie ride,i like the original version better than the remix but the remix is still pretty phat
4,Parrot love,What can I say Coco the quaker is finicky but likes this for stress release.As a punching bag or a crunchy.
3,Looks nice in the cage,It looks nice in the cage but my bird has only paid attention to the twine its hung with :)
3,dland,This product was instantly torn to shreds. The chinzy twine used didnt even hold it up for 15 minutes. For the breed it states can handle this toy my Amazon made quick work of going M Ali on this product. Not a good value for the money
4,great product,"I own a sun conure, and he didn't figure out what to do with it for about two days. Once he did though he loved tearing it apart. he liked it so much i went and got another one. it doesn't last very long (like a week for my bird), but it does provide some entertainment while i'm not home."
4,"SMALL Kabobs - very enjoyable, gone too soon.","I buy kabob chips, large kabobs, medium kabobs, and these small kabobs for my parrots to incorporate into new toys for them. The ones advertised here are the small kabobs. My pionus only likes the small kabobs. They are easy to string up and, for her, they last anywhere from a few minutes to a day, depending upon what other items are on the toy. This was a pretty good price for these, since I've seen the same string of small kabobs for$9."
3,Scary Stuff,"My bird decided that it is scary and refuse to be anywhere near it. After a week of it being in sight, I slowly move it into birdie's room, right above his food bowl, but then he was so frightened, he stopped eating from that bowl, so I had to retire the toy completely. Too bad..."
4,Amazon favorite,The only activity my amazon enjoys ( besides eating and showering). Keeps her occupied and is good for her beak.It is very light weight and curved so it will not harm her if she bumps into it.Great bird toy for a chewer.
3,Good for small birds...not macaws,My friend gave this item to me for my blue and gold macaw. It lasted about a day. Great product for a African Gray and it's a good value. But it's a little pricey if your bird thinks a 2x4 is a chew toy.
3,Scarey Toy,"It's probably a great product (based on other reviews), but my Cockatiel Eamon won't go near it. Maybe because it's bigger than he is. I'm going to cut off a few sections and see if he is less intimidated."
1,For children,"After reading the book, I was rather excited about the prospect of playing the game (the book, obviously, will help with initial sales of the game). Anyway, I finished it in just a few hours and was left with a gnawing feeling of, ""that's it?"" Between Kate getting in the way, blabbing out orders and giving solutions to the already simple puzzles, I came away with the feeling that the game should be marketed to children. The evil guys can be defeated simply by a couple of hits followed by an ""I yield,"" something that should be fun for the kids. The simple puzzles, complete with orders from Kate, should also be confidence-boosting for children who are beginning to learn more complex games. As for adults who are experienced gamers, I recommend cherishing the memories of a good book and spending money on other alternatives."
4,"Good, but not what I expected.","Timeline is certainly not what I expected it to be. First off, it is a very simple game that anyone could beat. I am not a big gamer, but I still found it very easy. If you are buying this game because you are a fan of the book, you may want to reconsider. Although it is easy, you need a really good graphics card and a fast computer to get the most out of Timeline. I have a 266MHz Celron with 64MB of RAM, and I found the game very slow on my computer. After about 2 minutes, the game would freeze up, and it took a while to respond to my moves. Despite all these drawbacks, Timeline does have excellent graphics. The music is even better. It sounds like a theme song from a movie (it will hopefully be in the Timeline movie coming out this fall). Overall, Timeline is a very good game, but people who aren't big gamers, and don't have computers designed for lots of gaming, should stay away from it."
1,This WILL NOT install on windows XP!,"Don't get this game if you have windows XP. If you try to install the game, a little box will pop up telling you that this game will not run on a windows NT operating system. It will then kick you out of the installation and you're stuck with a game you can't play."
1,Do you believe in life after Too Much Joy?,"Too Much Joy was a terrific, underrated band that never really got their full due. Wonderlick consists of Tim Quirk and Jay Blumenfield from that band. The album sounds like Too Much Joy, to a certain extent...but the unfortunate extensive use of electronic drums and vocal processing give this album a mechanical ""hip-hoppy"" feel. If you abhor the ""vocoder"" steppy-vocals effect used by Cher on her excruciating ""Believe"" single as much as I do, then it's all-too-frequent use on THIS record should give you ample reason to avoid this recording at all costs."
1,Would give it 0 stars if I could!!!,This diet is nothing but a money maker. You have to buy their products to be on the diet. Too time consuming and expensive! I would give it 0 stars if I could. It's also a Low calorie diet. They recommend no more than 800 calories per day!!! Too LOW! These days I guess people can publish anything!!
4,Great for seconds,I use this unit as a second for my bedroom tv and it has just been great.You can pay more for other units but for just watching tapes it is just great and the color is cool.
1,What a bore!,"Yet again, readers can hear the tired ideas about self-esteem, and receive the message that a plus-size lady can do whatever she pleases ... as long as it is exercise. Emme further reinforces the absurd stereotypes about ""relationships with food"" in her childhood reminiscences. Enough! In an era where so many women are obsessed with food, we do not need more time to dwell on the matter. Let's feed and exercise our intelligence for a change."
5,the ingalls wilder homesites,"Alot of good historical reading on the Ingalls and wilder families and the places they lived. the photos are black and white, but the book does have good reading."
2,Out of 3 orders only the 1st was good,The first time I ordered this product it was rich and thick. The next 2 orders of this product were thin and completely different consistency. VERY DISSAPOINTED!
5,Great Job of Browning Meat,"I love the Wok so far. Have made Lo Mein (where the Wok handled a LOT of veggies and pasta), then just used to brown stew meat for Slow Cooker beef stew recipe. I had 3 pounds, but only had to brown in two batches as I put some of meat in each batch along the sides until the bottom ones with oil browned. Took less than a minute to give nice crusty brown."
5,Breville Wok,"This is the most wonderful product and the best wok out of 4 that I have ever owned! It has a solid, detachable base, and the entire machine has a feeling of substance to it. No more worries about my wok tipping over on the burner, as this sits solidly on the countertop. Temperature control is a breeze, quick and responsive. Food is easily scooped up the side and out to my serving dish. The wok is easy to clean. I can find nothing negative to say about this product and would give it 10 stars if possible. We now have stir-fry several times a week."
5,Fantastic,This was a gift for my husband. He loves it. It came very quickly with no trouble. It Cooks great.
5,This is the way it should be...,"When I was using a stove top wok my chinese food would be more like stew than stir fry because I couldn't get the wok hot enough. This unit gets nice and hot. I've owned the Breville for about 2 months now and love it. My decision was between this unit and the Cuisinart electric. I chose the Breville because I didn't need such a large wok, the glass top seems to be more practical, and the Breville just looks great. Purchased mine at Dillards for $70 after comparing the two. I now use this appliance more than any other I've owned.My only concern is that the non stick surface seems to scratch easily. I've only ever used nylon spatulas. The scratches are probably just natural wear and doesn't seem to affect the non-stick capabiities."
3,Wok is really hot but what's with the non-stick surface?,"I bought this wok based on the reviews posted here. I have to say that I agree that it gets really hot and I am amazed at how well it performs. That being said, I have noticed that the non-stick surface has a lot of surface scratches and I use a plastic spatula. Yesterday, I made Beef Lo Mein and the pan was just as great as beforehand. However, upon washing it up in the sink, I noticed that a piece of the non-stick had peeled off. My experience with that coating suggests that this will continue to occur as I use the appliance more often. This is very disappointing as this is the best performing wok that I have ever used. I'm crossing my fingers hoping that the non-stick won't continue to peel. That would certainly betray the overall performance of an otherwise excellent appliance"
4,"Good Wok, Almost Perfect","Solid, heavy gage construction cooks evenly. See-through lid is equally thick, which is good because it retains heat and doesn't cause steam condensation as as most others do.It appears non-stick coating will last -- again, because heavier construction dissipates heat and won't sear the surface. Time will tell.Would be great if base could be removed without turning over. Removing contents to a bowl for serving can be a trick. Removal for cleaning is good.Size is smaller than Maxim? that I had previously. Not that the larger size is needed for large amounts (wok cooking tends to boil or steam large amounts instead of searing the food; rather, a larger size would make stirring easier.Would have gotten 5 stars if larger and base were removable while cooking."
5,Love this so much I bought it as a gift.,I read other reviews so I bought one myself. I loved it so much I then bought it for a wedding gift. It's great because the base is removable and can go into the dishwasher. Highly recommended!
3,"Great, but not perfect.","Vendor was fine, received on time, great transaction.Still using it years later now. It doesn't seem to get quite as hot as it used to, and the food started sticking to it after just a few uses even though I took care to follow cleaning instructions. But it is still usable and it really is fully immersible as advertised."
5,Love this Wok,This wok is wonderful. It's everything I thought it would be and more. I wish the sides were about two inches higher but it is a very large wok. The directions say to heat it for several minutes before cooking but it only takes a minute to heat up. It holds the heat at a uniform temperature so veggies and meat cook evenly. Very easy cleaning. Money well spent.
5,Hottest HUGE Wok - great durability - unless you drop the top,"The wok is VERY big and it gets hot easily and quickly.I agree it would be great to not have the teflon surface, but it works very well.Love this wok, have used it for several months and it always cooks just right. Easy to clean. Very heavy and sturdy.The cord stores easily and the controls are easy to use.Cleaning was a challenge originally, since it is larger than the sink. Now we simply add water after cooking, then when it cools a bit wipe it out.UPDATE (4/2011):1) Do not drop the top, it will shatter into lots of sharp pieces and make a loud noise. Luckily, we really didn't use the top so did not have to find out how much it would cost to replace.2) The teflon shows no signs of wear and we cook on it at least 6 times per month. Using the proper tools is key.3) cord, unit, heat time, finish, etc seem to be holding up very well."
2,It's toast once the coating wears off,"I reviewed this wok two years ago and was extraordinarily happy with it. 5 stars. However, after using it a few dozen times the coating has worn off on the bottom and everything sticks to the bottom. When I mean sticks, I mean STICKS! It is essentially useless. Rather than spend a $100 for a replacement I have switched to a flat-bottomed carbon steel season wok for an electric smoothtop. So, buyer beware! There is not an electric wok out there that generates as much heat. But once the coating goes, it is toast."
3,Not as hot as expected for stir-fry,It took a few minutes to get oil hot enough to fry eggs and vegetables. Not so easy to use and clean.
5,Excellent Purchase,"I purchased this item almost a year ago and have used it pretty heavily since then.The anti-stick surface doesn't have a scratch on it and I think this could almost pass for new with a thorough cleaning. The wok gets very hot and maintains heat well during cooking, even when you need high heat for an extended period of time. The manual is extremely thorough and filled with recipes and tips for usage and care, in stark contrast with most other things one buys these days in this price range.Overall I am very happy with this purchase, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone interested in wok cooking. Just a quick, basic tip for anyone getting this or any other wok for the first time - work on cutting your meat well. With other cooking methods the cut isn't as important but with a wok the heat is high enough and the cooking time short enough that different sized pieces can easily burn or not get cooked through."
4,Electric Wok,"Love it in all ways. We can cook meals faster and more inexpensively. HOWEVER,it was advertised to be scratch resistant especially if using the spatula provided.NOT TRUE FOR ME. In about 1 month it already has multiple,fairly deep scatches. Will have to see how helpful the company is in exchanges or remendations"
4,"Great Wok, but","This wok heats up well, cooks fine, and is super easy to clean. Makes cooking a quick stir fry a snap. For these reasons we highly recommend it. However, the design of the removable base is not good, and I constantly fight to put the base back on the wok after cleaning, a real bummer."
1,Worthless,"I accidentally left some food in the wok on a Friday, went out of town and got back on a Wednesday, and the wok was ruined.The ""teflon"" was peeling like 50 year old paint. What a bad joke."
4,A little info about S-Generation vs. N-Generation...,"This (""S"") is music from Final Fantasy VII, VII, and IX. ""N"" is from Final Fantasy V and VI. If I had known that earlier (that they _are_ different) I would haveordered both.I just got ""S"" and have had it for about an hour. It's nice piano and symphony music. I'd call it ""modern classical."" Diffinately a good CD for relaxation.I don't know anything (significant) about Final Fantasy, but I'd recommend this to anyone who likes classical music."
4,Impressed,"As a serious musician, (and almost-obessive Final Fantasy fan), I must say I was impressed with this collection. My favorite tracks were Liberi Fatali and One-Winged Angel, which feature impressive choral arangements. Aeris's Theme is truly moving; even more so than in the game. All tracks are well-performed, although some of the strictly piano selections can become tiresome."
1,There are many books on Henri that are infinitely better than this one.,"Warnings by the re-publishers of this monograph on Robert Henri don't do justice to how bad the reproductions are and how thin the commentary by Nationael Pousette-Dart is. The all around quality of this small publication is so low, that it simply doesn't add a dot to the scholarship on the painter. I should have taken the warnings more seriously before buying. Don't make my mistake."
4,A mixed blessing,"I found this one out of the blue one day, and I got to hear these for the first time, but my computer wouldn't play it, and this is from before the CD piracy rage having to put protection on. It must've been scratched or something. It played fine in regular CD players. The record company in the UK, Pinnacle, couldn't really help me. I did get their edition of the album, and that works fine, but there's no enhanced section like the U.S. edition.On the bright side, it has ""Don't Let Me Down"", not on ""Photograph Smile"" except in Japan, which is an original and not from you-know-who. The third track is on the album everywhere, ""Good to Be Lonely"". This single's out of print, so get this today!"
5,Very pretty and elegant-looking.,"I finally got iced tea spoons! No more burned, wet fingers from stirring tea with a short spoon. These have a simple, graceful design. The shiny parts are very shiny and the satin finish parts are a matte silver, a nice contrast. I've washed them in the dishwasher already and they are d/w safe as advertised."
5,teaspoon review,"We recently purchased 2 sets of the Mikasa Classico Satin Ice Tea Spoons. They were received in minimum time and are exactly what we were looking for; long, well made and pleasing to the eye. Have washed them several times in the dishwasher and are holding up so far.....Would purchase another set if necessary."
5,Mikasa Iced Tea Spoons,These spoons have a substantial feel in your hand and are of excellent quality for such a low price. The satin finish with shiny edges is a nice complement to my Satin Butterfly Meadow stainless.
4,Great ice tea spoons,We use these spoons for ice cream. They are of good weight and easy to use. We love them.
4,Another outstanding study by Margaret Jacob,"Excellent work of an historian notwithstanding the fact that she is probably not initiated in the mysteries of Freemasonry; She points out positively the radical philosophical, social and political elements of the origins who are still alive and kicking to day, and so bitterly neglected by her colleage Jonathan Israel. in his ""RADICAL ENLIGHTENMENT"" notion she branded and that he borrowed from her.HSch.."
1,The Origins of Freemasony: Facts and Fiction,"This title was misleading. There is little of facts or fictions. A very scholarly work, but not too readable. Theme was based on research of 1600-1900 Masonry in England, Netherlands, and especially France and women in Masonry. I am not making it part of my Masonic library."
1,no Labor no love,"Ok, this is not about that this one has nothing to do with the Patlabor Series or the two Movies. This is about a story, that is so worn out and thin, even or especially in the Anime genre, that is disguised as a visual Police movie. While the movie avoids being a action/horror b-movie, it's a c-grade police movie instead. The thin story is disguised by the visual narrative stolen from the original Patlabor movies. Where in those the slow narrative unfolding had a meaning and sense, WXIII just makes an empty gesture.It COULD have been an acceptable Action/Horror b-movie with this worn out genetic-mutation theme but as it is, it's merely worth the time watching it one time and then go ahead."
1,Not even worth the Patlabor name!,"Pros: The scientist lady kills herself. >:]Cons: Slow paced, horrible music, boring storyline, horrible characters, annoying little girls.Final Verdict: The movie blows!"
1,"If you loved Patlabor Movies 1&2, then don't watch!","Falling in love with Patlabor 1&2, I expected to see SV2 and the Labors used but in WX13, no such thing. Yes the story does try to take the movie in a different direction, but for the majority of people watching this, already seen this kind of plot. A robot turns into a bio-mechanical robot (BGC2040?), and requires the skill of heroes to stop it. Seriously, I had flashbacks of Bubblegum Crisis on my mind. The fact is, the only real suprise I had was when the monster had ""watermelons"".Next time, they should stick to drama and action instead of trying to redo the ""robot monster"" cliche."
3,Bluelight !! otherwise okay player,"As other reviewer pointed out blue light could be a real issue if you put the player in bedroom or even in living room if you happen to sleep in living room. Blue light gives this player cheap appearance of some toy. Otherwise it is okay player, though I would say claims of up-convert is highly overrated. Don't expect to be completely dazzled as soon as you remove your old dvd player and hook this one in. Overall it is okay player with only hitch being blue light."
2,It looks good...,"...and that's about the only good experience I have had with this DVD player.I bought a Samsung because I had had years of positive experience with their mobile phones and had high expectations. I have been so disappointed.1) Two months after the purchase it had to be returned because the disc loader mechanism failed.2) Even after manufacturer repair I find it skips and sticks endlessly, these are on cleaned DVDs which play fine in the computer.3) There appears to be a long lag in response time when using the remote. When forwarding or rewinding this is a significant problem.I was so excited when I got it and now I can't wait to replace it."
2,SAME PICTURE AS ANY PLAYER OUT THERE,"I bought the player a few days ago from amazon.com for $134.00 got it in a few days opened the box and found the batteries were so old the acid was leaking out, no big deal but kinda scared me, next is if you are buying this model to have a hd picture from your dvd's you won't be impressed so my advice is buy a less expensive unit, the only thing about the hdmi I like is my tv doesn't need to have the inputs switched using hdmi you just turn on the dvd player and the tv switches to the player"
1,No Difference compared to progressive 480P,"I have connected this player to a Samsung HDTV and optimized all of the settings to get the best possible picture but it did not make any noticeable difference even via HDMI connection. Most DVD's out there are recorded using 480 format so even an up conversion player will not make any real difference that is beyond what is originally recorded on the DVD. At the moment, it is better to wait for the new wave of blue-ray players coming out next year that will be true HD and will be able to play the new HD format DVD's that are due to come out sometime next year. I have a one year old JVC progressive DVD player that I compared to the Samsung but the JVC @ 480P seemed to have smoother and clearer quality than this unit. I am returning it back to the store and will just wait for the true HD players that are due to come out next year."
4,"2 ""wishes""","I don't have any major regrets however, if I had 2 wishes for improvements they would be. 1. that it would remember where you left off when you stop and then restart. 2. the remote has to be aimed almost directly at the player....it seems to be very intolerant to anything less."
2,"HDMI Compliancy issues, block noise","When using this DVD player, some HDMI ""hand shaking"" problems were discovered. The player has trouble authenticating with the TV if the TV is powered on after the player (when the splash screen should be visible). Block noise has very little filtering; although for an HDMI player of this price range, this is somewhat expected."
3,just ok software,"After my daughter fell in love with the computer using reader rabbit toddler, this software package is disappointing. It is slow moving and requires skills for the advanced toddler or preschooler...ie reading words. I am hoping she can grow into in and then get some use out of it. We have only tried the Blues clues ( that one is where they need to read words), and the winnie the pooh which is really slow moving, not much in the way of a game...more like a story telling."
5,Dogbert rules supreme!,"I would gladly have all of Dilbert's books on my shelf, if only I could afford them. Slowly, but surely, I am amassing an amazing collection."
4,What is there to say...,"It really makes you pity Scott Adams, because you just know that due to his 16 years doing corporate work, he saw a lot of what is featured in the comic strip.Very funny. What else is there to say?"
3,Good...,"At the beginning of this year I broke my right arm (a nondisplaced fracture). Even though the bone healed, I've been having muscle, nerve and tendon issues from my wrist to my shoulder. A compression sleeve was recommended by my orthopedic surgeon.I have a small wrist - 6.25"". I was afraid I'd waste $45 on this because no other sleeve has worked for me. I got the large and it works. It's perfect for my elbow and upper arm. On my wrist it's still a little loose. I know if I had gotten the medium, it would have been too tight for my upper arm. Either way, it works for now. I guess not many adults have tiny wrists when they're 5'8"".The price though... kills me!"
4,Great way to teach the Teen numbers that can be so confusing!,"Loved it! Played with it in circle time for over a week and the kido's did not get tired of it. Now I have it stored away to play with later. I had three of them stand on the mat on a number they picked. I then said add two (etc.) and they would all walk forward two and tell me the number they were on. Same with subtract. Or I would say jump on fifteen, etc. Also we did count down from 20 to 0 and then blasted off. Their are allot of play options. Fit perfectly in my little hall in my house."
3,This goes up to 20,I didn't get to use this product. We have a small space and when I opened the box I realized that it was much longer than what is shown on the photo. The strip goes up to 20 and that added about another seven feet. I had to send it back and I did get a full refund and I was happy with that. The plastic was a little thin. Would have probably have had to tape it down to keep it from sliding. Amazon made it very easy to return the product and they refunded me very quickly.
5,Great game BUT!,"This is one of my favorite ""godgames"" or ""city management simulators"", and I've been scouring the net trying to score a copy - but seriously Eidos? $47 for a game released in 2001?! Even for an old game that was one of my -favorites- it's unreasonable to expect any more than $7-14 USD for such a dated title. Put this puppy on Steam and I guarantee you'll sell 10 times more copies for a reasonable price than what you'll get trying to sell it for upwards of 50 bucks."
3,A Great Beginning,"This game is easy to like. The slick graphics and interactive feel make it modern and appealing. The quirky techno soundtrack helps too. The only complaint I can levy is that it's easy to finish all the ""training"" levels, and go straight to the open ended ""sandbox"" mode. After you control the entire station, there's nothing else to shoot for!I bought this game pre-9/11, and I think something must've happened to stopo production on a sequal, or an improved newer version....I mean come on....Sim City got a second, third and fourth chance, and spun-off countless times....why not Startopia?"
3,"Good, but Maltitol is the second ingredient in these...","While these do taste quite good for darker chocolate, they don't quite compare to the typical 72% option. And the maltitol causes serious digestive issues to say the least. Why can't they use sucralose or stevia as the sweetener? I would be much more tempted to buy these again if they did."
1,Not really sugar free,"This product is not really sugar free. If you check the calories from sugar, which I could not find disclosed here, you will see that the product has calories from sugar in it. While it does not include regular sugar, it does include Maltitol which is a sugar alcohol. Not really a good choice for someone looking for no sugar as there are better alternatives. A 90% chocolate can get the sugar count down to 1 gram of sugar per serving."
5,Excellent Chocolate,"I do not need sugar free products. However, when I bought these chocolates for a diabetic family member, I found myself wanting to eat them instead of the regular chocolates in the house. I prefer Amber Lyn over See's and most other European chocolates available here in the US. The texture is very smooth and creamy, the chocolate is not overly sweet, and the portions are just right."
5,awesome!!!,"All Amber Lyn chocolates are wonderful! I don't like dark chocolate, but I like this! I cannot recommend Amber Lyn chocolates enough. I discovered them at their roadshow inside Costco and they were much cheaper there, so keep looking in your warehouse. I recommend these every day!"
3,The world unseen,The best thing about this movie is it opened my eyes to the way things were/are in South Africa. How badly people were/are treated by the government.
5,The World Unseen,"This is an excellent movie showing the terrible effects of appartide.The story depicting the different relationships was done in a sensitive, tender manner.In the midst of threats people showed such courage and integrity.I would recoomend this movie for all to see.Thank you,Diane Rapozo"
4,Beautiful love story set against backdrop of ugly apartheid violence,"Gorgeous scenery, beautiful people, and a tender love story are presented while the obscenity of government-approved racial bullying seethes just underneath the surface. Ray plays a wife and mother who aches to break out of a smothering family life in South Africa, and Sheth owns a cafe who could benefit greatly from Ray's cooking skills. Unfortunately for both, the apartheid British police believe that Sheth is a rebellious gay woman (a triple threat!), and threaten to remove Ray's children if she involves herself with the cafeterias owner. There are other subplots further emphasizing the inhumanity visited upon the targets of a govt's hatred, but the love story is tenderly and convincingly told. I recommend it for anyone seeking a romantic lesbian story, yes, but also for any students of history or anyone curious abt how evil a govt can behave towards its own people. The two halves of this film are equally important."
5,The World Unseen,"Love it, love it, love it! Lisa Rani Ray and Sheetal Sheth shine in this wonderful film written about love and South Africa during apartheid. These two actresses also star together in I Can't Think Straight, a book and film by the same author/film director, Shamim Sarif. Lovely stories, both!"
3,It's OK,"This one isnt bad, but it isnt good either. There are so few great lesbian movies out there...."
5,Lovely,O purchased this carnelian necklace to go with some earrings and when they arrived they were a perfect color match which was fortunate because natural stones always very. They are extremely light weight and delicate but not fragile they are well made and excellent value for the price. I shall buy from this company again. The service was excellent
5,Caroline Don't Change!!!,I traveled from DC to NY twice to see this production in 2004. Trust me...What you hear on this CD is what I saw and heard in the Theatre!! I agree with the previous reviewers in that this musical is years ahead of it's time. Years from now it will be mentioned along with Sondheim works and Dreamgirls as musicals that were on the cutting edge of musical theatre!!!
5,AMAZING!,"This show is a MUST SEE and this album is a MUST BUY! As much as the show is incredible (lavish moving sets, beautiful costumes and wonderful lighting effects) the musical aspect is the true star of the show (as it should be!) This makes Caroline or Change a show that you can see over and over and never become board by the simple fact of knowing the plot. I saw it for the second time and found myself enjoying it ever more, a first in the theatre, since I usually day dream the 2nd time around, even at the best of shows. This factor makes the album one that is wonderful to listen and love forever! The entire show has been recorded and the humor, anger and amazingly powerful acting in this production have been beautifully captured on this 2 disc recording.BUY Caroline, SEE Caroline!"
5,Magnificient Musical Achievement,"We are very fortunate to have a comprehensive recording of ""Caroline, or Change,"" one of the finest musicals ever to be offered on Broadway. Social, political, economic, religious and even geographic themes are explored here in an amazingly heartfelt and groundbreaking show. Tony Kushner and Jeanine Tesori (with such sensitive music) have given us a true gift, and the entire cast unwraps it, layer by layer, until we see (and hear) so much about American life."
2,One of the Worst Of the Season,"I was thrilled when I heard that Tonya Pinkins was returning to Broadway. Unfortunately the vehicle that brought her back was Caroline, or Change. The score to this show is horrendous! There seems to be no pattern, no thought process that went into the show. If anyone can find a humm-able melody in the show you deserve a gold star! Being a HUGE Sondheim fan I am used to 'different' song structure, but this goes completely away from any form that anyone was ever taught. For anyone contemplating purchasing this CD, I warn you in advance. You will certainly not play it more than a few times. Even Tonya can't save this monstrosity of a show."
2,Not my style at all,"While it is well performed and sung, I don't care for the music or lyrics of this show. There are few snippets of music here and there that I hoped would build into a full song, but they disappeared. Some of the lyrics were far too simple and seemed written for the sake of a rhyme. I would have preferred to follow the daughter's story. I found her far more interesting and engaging than her mother Caroline or the young boy. I didn't hate the show, but I really have not connected to it in any way. It didn't move me or engage me. I'm not a fan of sung-through musicals so temper my review with that thought."
3,Nice. Overpriced.,"When I first opened the box, I noticed how thin and flimsy this thing felt. It's made of plastic, not metal, and is very light. I replaced the thin, wax cord string with a thicker, dark brown cord so it would look less feminine. $15 is really too much for this thing, even if it does look pretty nice. $5 would be a better price. I mean I like it, but it's a rip-off."
3,Out dated and way too many plugs for Mr. Boston&#65533;s products,"While there is a good deal of great information contained within its pages the guide desperately needs to be modernized. It lacks many of the most popular shooters, and has very few recipes for flavored vodkas and rum. I would strongly suggest either the playboy's bartender guide or bartending for dummies over this guide.While there are some very nice full color pictures in the guide all of them areActually adds for the Mr. Boston brand of spirits. Also some of the recipes call for the Mr. Boston brad name of a drink instead of the generic name of the alcohol this can be very confusing since Mr. Boston is not available in all areas"
3,OK,"This book is the standard reference work to mixed drinks and cocktails and most bars have a copy. However, many of the drinks in this book were popular in the 30s-60s and are not ordered today. This is more of a reference work with hundreds of drink recipies. If you want to learn about the types of spirits, how to select a wine, etc. look elsewhere."
2,"Covers the basics, but too many annoying product promos","The guide seems to have all the basic drinks, techniques, and supplies covered. At the beginning of each section (whiskey, rum, vodka, etc), there's an overview that would be good except for the annoying product promos. In the end, there were so many plugs for Mr Boston spirits and other brands, I felt like Mr Boston should be paying me for reading all these no-so-subtle ads."
2,A Disappointment,"Yes, this is probably the first drinks book you'll buy. (I suppose because this is what is sold in liquor stores....) For that reason, everyone has a copy. However, the names uses for the various liquors are their own--even though in many cases their's is the generic brand. Which is frustrating. I also marvel as how many drinks are not in here, perhaps because they are usually made with another distiller's brands? Ignoring that, it is a convenient size and is well laid out. Keep looking."
1,Living on Reputation,"The 65th hard-cover edition of Mr. Boston would not rate a grade of ""C"" in any journalism class that I could imagine. Time-Warner did not spend enough money in editing (and re-write) to catch that the Introduction still refers to the book as the 64th edition. All-in-all, Amazon should not offer such a piece of junk.One might say that well there may be silght <s> errors, the book has everything. In fact, Time-Warner sub-titles the book as ""Official Bartender's and Party Guide"" and further offers the comment ""A Best Seller Since 1935..."" Well, your favorite cake may have all the ingredients - butter, flour, sugar, eggs, etc. but if the mix is not done properly and if the cake time/temperature is not correct, well...And, I can't say it contains all the ingredients. For one, there is no listing for a Vodka Martini. My bartenter acquantainces say this has been the most popular martini for several years.My suggestion is to stay away from Mr. Boston."
1,Disappointing,"I was a big Amber fan with her THIS IS YOUR NIGHT and AMBER albums but this CD definetly doesn't have the quality she showed us in the past. There are a few songs that are OK. Yes was not her best single by any means and I didn't care for it too much but at least it had energy.THE NEED TO BE NAKED is just OK. A little cheesy but it has a little energy too. The only problem is it seems like bad teen pop. The only other song worth mentioning is SEX WITHOUT SEX and it is only ok. Maybe if a remixed version were made it could have done well but still a little blah in its original version. The other songs are boring and a waste of time. Don't waste your money on this. If you want dance music look somewhere else. A few of the songs will give you a giggle and make you wonder what she was thinking. THE SMILE OF MY CHILD is one them. Its Horrible with quite a humorous sounding ""LAH LAH LAH LAH LAH"" that starts the song off."
3,Amber-lite disappoints,"This has got to be a disappointment for all Amber's fans. Whilst the lady herself has made much of her new direction, and various music styles, the rest of us are left wishing that there was more dance. Strangely, unlike other CDs, all the slower songs are shoved up front - making the first hearing a severe disappointment. You'll find yourself panicking that there arent going to be any new dance tracks at all. Luckily as the album progresses more club tracks emerge - Sex Without Sex ('Sexual 2') and Sex In The City (camper than a pride march) being the better examples. The bonus Thunderpuss edit of Need to Be Naked and chilled break down of Sexual, cannot disguise the fact that this album is Amber-lite. If a singer has a career built on big circuit dance tunes, why go and turn out a CD of limp (very limp) ballads and Anastacia wanna-be tracks?"
1,Can't be compared to Kylie's Fever,Only the first two tracks of the CD are great while the rest are so boring.
2,Very dissapointing release from Amber,"If you want Amber at her best buy ""Remixed"". I was very much looking forward to this release after hearing the first single ""Yes"", but I was extremely disappointed by almost every other song on the CD. This woman is extremely talented and has worked with great people, but this does not pack the punch of previous efforts. The Afterlife Chillout Remix of ""Sexual"" (an incredible song that Amber's record company finds a way to put in every release) is miserable. There are a couple of good songs: ""Sex and the City"" and ""The Need To Be Naked"", but no ""Sexual"" to be found here. The song ""The Smile of A Child"" has got to be most akward song placement is years and it's the worst song I've ever heard from Amber. I'll still be watching this talent, but this release is not worth your hard earned money."
3,Words really do make a song!,"Amber is back. C'mon, the music is great on this CD, danceclub ready, but I can't believe how stupid the words are. Solid Goop! Especially the song,""The smile of my child."" Let's face it, most of the people who listen to this cd are not going to have kids, so this won't ""speak"" to them, at all!! I was excited about this CD, but as I listened, well...she just needs to get better writers. If you don't care what a song says, buy the album, it really does have great music."
2,This CD misses the mark,"I'm a big Amber fan, but I hate to say it, this CD misses the mark. In past CD's I'd hit the repeat button and listen over and over. This one doesn't rate that. Nothing memorable or worth listening to over and over again. Lyrics are weak and some of the songs are too repetitive. I bought this CD unheard, based on past, now I'll have to listen to previews before buying another. Sorry Amber."
4,"This was a very well done CD, but...","This was a great CD. The music flowed great. The title selections were very thought out. The opera song from FF III was done unbelievably well. The only problem I saw with it was that almost half the CD had vocals in it in one way or another. I prefer instrumentals rather than vocals, and even though I do like the vocals done in FF S Gen and even a couple in this CD, I do believe there were a couple too many. I can't say much about them because about half-way through I would just skip over them. At the time I was more interested in finding out how many there were in the CD. I have listened to the whole CD at least once and I will attest that this CD is well worth the money spent. True FF die-hards will not be disappointed."
1,WARNING: Don't buy this here (great album though),Don't buy this from Amazon! I've had this on order since June of 2005 and I have still not received it (October 18th at time of writing). It's a great album and I think it's worth the money but get it somewhere else.
3,A Howard Dean Primer,"So, I read this book to see what all of the fuss is about. I sense that Dean wrote 100% of this himself; it is certainly not written by a professional writer. Having said that, it is an extremely short, easy read into why he thinks as he does. The book shows alot of candor, and opens the reader up to what and who Dean is. Politics aside, DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER THE REVIEW BY MIKE DUTTON! He is exactly from whom Dean is trying to win back America."
1,Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse....,"As if Carter and CLinton weren't bad enough for this country as Presidents and Al Gore tries to steal what he can't win. Wins only 19 states to Bush's 31 (and 178 electoral votes)now we have Howard Dean who, get this, calls Al Gore ""The Elected President."" But then again, Howard Dean won't open his files to let anyone check out his past.Just when you thought we have seen the last of the bad Democrats, along comes Dean.If this idiot wins, I'm going short the stock market and leave the country. Unemployment will hit the same 14% we saw in the 70's. The economy, which is now finally turning around thanks to GWBII, will make a 180-degree turn backwards. Taxes will go up along with unemployment will SOAR!Just when we thought things couldn't get any worse, along comes Dean. This guy almost makes Clinton and Gore look decent!Vote for Clark or Lieberman and ditch this jerk."
1,Beware,"If you think Clinton severely reduced our military capability and Carter destroyed our economy, you ain't seen nothing yet. This man would do more harm than all the feckless Democratic presidents in the last half century put together."
5,"Buy, read, and pass on to friend","""Winning Back America"" is an excellent autobio/campaign book written by our next President. The quality of the writing itself makes it somewhat obvious that Dean is doctor/politician and not an author but I have read much worse from politicians. The substance of the book is clear, direct, and to the point, much like the good doctor himself. The first half is about Dean's life until he decided to run for President, the second half is about his campaign and his platform. Anyone, whether expirienced Deaniacs or folks new to Howard Dean, will get something from reading this. Give'm hell Howard!"
4,Good picture of Dean,"I bought this book because I'm not sure who to vote for this year. I was hoping that I would learn whether Dean was a man of substance or not, and perhaps something about his views on topics not covered on the campaign trail.As it turned out, I probably didn't need to bother. Widely covered debates in recent weeks have told me everything I needed to know about Dean, and just as much as is in this fairly self-serving book.I would still urge reading it, however, whether or not you are considering voting for him. Dean seems likely to stick around, even if he doesn't get the nomination or get elected, and knowing what's going on in his brain is a good thing."
1,worked okay while it lasted,"Bought it in March 2005, and lo and behold, June 2007 - the blender was dead! Has anyone else had the same problem? I had an Osterizer before this that lasted 15+ years! Some one is out of touch with reality here, and I don't think its me. Breville seriously needs to assess the quality of their products if they want to be taken seriously."
2,Doesn't blend,"Pretty, but doesn't blend smoothies. The problem seems to be the innovative blade design -- instead of the usual blades at the bottom that produce a smooth-flowing vortex, the Breville (patented) blades spin higher in the container and splash stuff all over the sides and top. Somehow, this splashing, churning motion lets thumb-sized chunks of frozen fruit escape the blades even with a long running time, pulsing, and hand-stirring. I've given up on it, and will return to my half-burnt-out cheapo Hamilton-Beach while waiting for repairs on a dead Waring. If only one could combine the Waring or Hamilton-Beach blades and container with the quiet and powerful Breville motor..."
1,Not worth [money],"This book is WAY overpriced for the content you get. Each of the many topics is only covered by a short little blurb - at best a couple of pages. Sometimes the blurbs are interesting, sometimes they aren't. But they all end, and sometimes abruptly. Sometimes you get drawn into the subject and then the author pulls the plug. It's like a tease. I almost think the author was hunting for a Nascar topic to write on, couldn't pick one, so decided to publish his notes instead.You'd actually be better off spending more money on better developed books covering in more detail a topic you are interested in. You might think that this book will give you a broad overview, but the information it provides is often too choppy to do even that.If you've just got to have this one, then at least go to Ebay and pick it up for a buck fifty. [Price] is really a steep price to pay for what you'll be getting here."
1,Big Waste!,"I bought this book thinking it would have good info on tracks, drivers and what not. If that is what you are looking for, At Speed is not that book. Dutton has spent time on each driver at a certain race. He gives no information about them, just a comment here or there. Nothing new about the tracks. Magazines can tell you more about individual tracks. I didn't notice much about the fans in NASCAR, either. Dutton clearly couldn't have spent much time on that anyway, judging from the rest of the book."
2,i thought it was boring,"the short articles on people/tracks were not very informative nor funny. most of the time, the articles weren't even relevant to the topic. skip this one..."
4,Metzger Regencies from the 1990s are great fun.,"If you like romantic but ""clean"" Regencies with humor, often including animals (and who doesn't like animals?), you'll like Barbara Metzger. Her best work that I've read is from the 1990s. This one is from 1998 and it still hasn't lost its charm.A rakish viscount finds an infant left on his doorstep. Must be his, right? He's a rake, after all. He's responsible enough to take responsibility for the babe but he doesn't know the first thing about caring for babies. So...into the picture comes a single woman with daughter who is working as housekeeper for his next-door neighbor. There's the fun of the cluelessness of our viscount and a bit of a mystery about this next-door lady and her past.It's cute, it's predictable but it's fun. Metzger has an appealing writing style. If you've never read Barbara Metzger before, she's worth a try if you like Regencies of the old school."
3,Diverting,"As Regencies go, this one was pretty good. Lord Heartless isn't really heartless, in much of ANY sense. Really, it wasn't clear at all why he'd received that appellation. Only the author said so. But Hartleigh is quite amusing, sweet, and kind. And Carissa is a very strong heroine. Male cluelessness is the most common target for fun here. It's sweet with a bit of mystery, though the return of the husband was assured early on. Not particularly realistic, this story, but then I don't read for realism. Could have had more romance, in my opinion. I rate it somewhere around 3 & 1/2 stars."
4,Of Masques and Martyrs,"Like all the sequel, I could not stop reading the moment I started. Christopher Golden is a genius that way. Peter with his shadow and human followers live in an ex convent while Hannibal and his vampire followers are rampaging all over the ""world"" (note, world is mostly the US, but we are used to it). Things go really wrong when Will is caught, tortured and killed by Hannibal, who had created a drug that removed all the vampire/shadows powers. From then on, there is war between shadows and vampires. Humans, by then decide to kill them all. Trust me, really worth reading it."
1,disappointing,"I apologize in advance to those people who actually liked this book, but I think it blew goats. Now, the first two books in the series were phenomenal. Well written, captivating, and did I mention they both had plots? The third, however, seemed to be just a vehicle for gratuitous violence and rather disgusting sex. The occasional bit of porn is fine, but that crap with Hannibal and Allison is precisely what I don't need to be reading...ever. I appreciate what Mr. Golden was trying to convey (yeah, Hannibal's a whackjob), but...EWWWW! All in all, I should have saved my money and smacked my head against a brick."
3,DOES NOT COMPARE WITH THE FIRST TWO BOOKS.,THE FIRST TWO BOOKS OF THE SERIES WERE CLASSIC. GOLDEN FAILS AT HIS ATTEMPT TO PUT CLOSURE ON THE SERIES. HE SHOULD HAVE STAYED WITH WHAT GOT HIM THERE. HE KILLED OF TOO MANY GOOD CHARACHTERS REPLACING THEM WITH INDIVIDUALS CREATED OUT OF NECCESSITY. GOLDEN HAS 2/3 OF A GREAT SERIES.
3,McGard 64010 Chrome Bulge Cone Seat Style Lug Nuts,"These McGard lug nuts (Model 64010 - 1/2"" - 20 Thread Size) do not fit/seat against the 15"" X 7"" stock wheels on a Jeep Cherokee Sport (XJ). The bulge cone seat on the bottom of the lug nut is different than stock lug nuts and they are also longer than stock. Both Amazon and McGard show that they will fit, but they definitely don't. The lug nuts themselves appear to be made very well, but if they don't fit then they're not of much use."
2,chrome finish not durable,i purchased these lug nuts in the fall of 2010 for my pick up. As of this spring after one winter season (Wisconsin here) i was disappointed that many of the lugs were already pitted with rust coming thru the finish. My hope when purchasing these was that they could handle a few winters without pitting or rusting. This was not the case and is why i gave them a rating of only 2 stars.
1,This is a piece of junk,"I bought this after seeing it on TV. This the first thing that I bought from an infomercial and it will be the last...It is JUNK. I tried it on my stove that has some caked on grease. It only made the grease wet and did not 'cut through' it as shown.. Like someone else said, it put out more hot water than steam... I did use the extension tube and got more steam, but still very lousy cleaning.I tried it on 'normal' countertop dirt and it did OK, but it took a lot longer than a bottle of cleaner and rag.The only thing it might (and I say might) be good on is my floor.. I have not tried it, but I am hoping I get something out of this purchase...If not, out the door with this POS..."
1,Scunci Steam Cleaner - Don't Waste Your Money,Please do not waste your time or money on this machine. It was a huge disappointment. A two year old blowing through a straw would clean better than this machine.
5,my bad!!!,"i had not corrected the mailing address and so the item was returned to Amazon and they issued a credit, I was very pleased with their service"
3,Breezies - Under Wire Blow Out,"I was introduced to Breezies several years ago by my mother. We're bustier women and require a lot of support. The lining is really nice, as is the basic construction of the bra. It would be the perfect bra if the under wires didn't break through the seam corners. I've purchased many of these bras over the years. It's odd, with each purchase, the under wires break through sooner. Despite their under wire malfunction, they still are better than most I've found. I sew the corners of the seams to reinforce them (or sew shut after they've poked through) so they last longer. If I were to make a suggestion to the manufacturer, it would be to find a fabric for the seams that under wires wont pop through as often or for them to reinforce the stitching. This most recent purchase, after a full day's wear, the under wire broke through and up the middle. Most of the time when they pop out, it's in the sides near the armpit. One day's wear...disappointing."
1,Not worth the money,This is just a plastic block with some metal carriage bolts. I tried calling customer support but never recieved a call back. Do not waste your money.
3,Lots of info... but,"The main reason I wanted to buy this book is so that I not only practise environmentally Safe Housekeeping, but also save money. Some of chapters (Automatic dishwashing, clothes washer detergents) are devoted to commercially available safe cleaners, which would be quite costly."
1,Not very happy with the book,"I purchased this book yesterday and when I began reading it today, the pages fell out as I turned the pages. In addition, it says Vitamin E is a preservative. It is NOT. Vitamin E is an anti-oxidant (keeps oils from rancidity). If you make a product that mostly consists of water with added ""food"" for bacteria which include tea or herbal infusions, than it either needs to be refrigerated, or preserved with a REAL preservative or you could run the risk of growing bacteria and mold in the very product you are hoping is good for your home. Not to mention getting the contaminated home made product on an open cut or wound and ending up with a bacterial blood infection, or worse. Also Grapefruit seed extract is not a preservative either. It is preserved with a preservative which makes people assume it works."
5,Best Comprehensive Cleaning Guide Out There,Annie Berthold-Bond has provided the definitive green cleaning guide on the market today. This is an easy-to-follow instruction guide for making every type of household cleaning product from spray starch to car wax. The ingredients were easy to locate and easy to assemble. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in making their own earth-friendly cleaning products.
5,Good Eco-friendly Resource,"I purchased a copy of this book many years ago and still use it. Over the years, I've purchased additional copies for family and friends. It is still the best resource out there making eco-friendly cleaning products."
4,Who knew,Who knew that most of the things you already have could do so much. I hate chemical smells and now I don't have to have them to achieve the same if not better results.
3,"Fair Book, a bit unfriendly","Clean and Green by Annie Berthold-BondMy third choice of the three I purchased. The author uses borax, zeolite, kitty litter, alum, and washing soda not chemicals of choice to use in standard household cleaners. The only one of these are used in the others is washing soda in laundry soap. It is not an easy read not due to content but font choice and the way the recipes are presented. A Little short on instruction and technique. There are tons of them however 485 aprox recipes or suggestions, she numbers them. All this on only 161 pages!! It is a good book to have but the other two would be a better choice to get started. I rated Clean Home Clean Planet first choice and Naturally Clean Home second above this one."
5,Very thorough.,"Annie Berthold-Bond's recommendations for cleaning recipes are compact, exact, and varied. Recipes are included for nearly every cleaning situation encountered in households today. The book may seem short and lacking the discussion typical of many ""stay green"" books. Don't let this fool you. When you just want to choose a good cleaning recipe (they're conveniently ordered by type of cleaning situtation) using ingredients you probably already have in your home, then this book is the one to choose."
4,People with environmental illness need this reliable info.,"I'm not much interested in housecleaning, but when I read Annie's recipes, I trust her attention to safe and healthy living. Environmental illness,a disease that requires a lot of housecleaning, has forced me to search for safe products, and to use them.I am comforted to find such a reliable and extensive source of information."
2,Horrible,"I have a purchased Wolfgang-Puck wild chicken-wild rice soup before and really liked it, and based on my previous experience ordered 20 cans of this roasted chicken & fine herbs soup from Amazon. Big mistake- it tastes horrible. Blindfolded, I can make better soup any day. Soup is very salty to my taste. Chickens are hard to find among the maze of gooey white balls. Not recommended."
2,Mostly bread globs,"I bought a case of this when it was on sale based on the description. Unfortunately, the main ingredient is round clumps of the whitest white bread you can imagine. The soup itself is just okay, but I have to remove the clumps of white bread to eat it. Not worth it."
3,not as good as other Samsungs,"The quasi-SVHS doesn't seem to make that big a difference with the unit I got. Pictures actually looked better on my previous and very reliable Samsung (don't have the model # with me), which I had passed along to my daughter. I thought this would be a step up. It wasn't. Wish more info was displayed on the read-out, such as the speed it was recording at. Remote is good, and liked the auto-clock and the programming. Functioned adequately until it went belly up after fourteen months, either ejecting cassettes when inserted, or just gobbling up the tape. BTW, the old unit my daughter got is still running great. Think she'd trade?"
4,Samsung VCR is a Good Value,"This is a pretty good VCR at a great price. I saw a demonstration of this unit. The 19 micron heads delivered a good picture in the EP mode. What I liked best about this unit is that it has SQBP, it has the capability of playing back S-VHS tapes. That's a good feature."
2,My hands are ice cold,"These gloves do not keep your hands warm in sub 50 degree weather. Here I was thinking it would be nice to have a nice warm glove and still have access to my fingertips for electronic devices, boy was I wrong, my hands are still chilly wearing these things. Sadly I bought 2 pairs :(."
4,fingerless friction gloves,"----------- they're a little TOO good ! i want to wear 'em all the time but they're too warm and a smidge bulky (not the friction dots, but the wool substrate ) .Big"
4,fingerless gripper gloves,These are very nice gloves for the money. They also serve pretty well as a set of driving gloves as the gripper dots give you a firm hold on the steering wheel yet by being fingerless allows easy access to audio system controls in the car as well as the all important iPhone. It was 29 degrees this mornng and were very warm except of course for the finger tips but they work very well at what they do.
4,These gloves are great for me.,"I use these gloves for many tasks, indoor and out. These gloves keep my hands warm on cold mornings and when the weather is less than desirable.My gloves, I found to be very itchy when I first received them. After a soak in hair conditioner, then closely inspecting and removing small pieces of plant matter, the gloves no longer feel that way."
5,Number one in quality and quantity!,"This is a book to people who have a bad idea of gehry work, like i had, because is amazing how the author made an retrospective of gehry work with so much quality and quantity work. And remember, this book is really ""cheap"" because is very good. IN MY OPINION, JUST BUY IT!"
5,AMAZING BOOK!,"There are no words to describe this fantastic book. Francesco Dal Co and others autor's made an excelent work for students, architects and people who are interested in good architecture. Congratulations!"
3,Well worth studying...,"Ranson's concrete advice on how to use photos for subject material is very sensible. It may be true that the best way to paint landscape is ""au plein air"" but if you live in Canada there are eight months each year when painting outside would not only be a positive health hazard - but the water would freeze on the brush!! Hence I'm glad of a book which acknowledges real life. I produced a pretty nice watercolor in about ten minutes using one of his photos. Well worth reading."
1,Does NOT fit a 2 Door Unlimited,"Although the Amazon ""does it fit"" says that it will fit a 2Door Unlimited (2003-2006) - it will not. They probably fit the standard TJ just fine. I looked on the Bushwacker site, and they don't claim it will work on an LJ (which is a TJ Unlimited) - so the issue is with Amazon's program for checking fit. Since the problem is only that the fuel door opening does not line up due to the extended body (not even close) - I may just cut them down since I already have the door center piece and the two front ones installed and really like those. My jeep will look odd if I don't have these installed, and I don't want to rip off the pieces already installed. Note that this rating is only because they don't work on my vehicle which was indicated they were - and I now have all the other pieces installed. Otherwise the piece looks great and install easily."
1,I don't like the picture of Vanna White,"I am a HUGE Vanna White fan. I watch Wheel of Fortune every day and i have the Nintendo DS version of the game at home. But i do not like the picture of Vanna White on the cover of Wheel of Fortune 2nd Edition.Good:Vanna's HairVanna's MascaraBad:Vanna's DressVanna's LipstickMikaela ArsenaultSalem,NH"
5,best game,"I love to play the wheel of fortune game, I have the first edition, I am trying hard to find out where I can purchase the second edition but I am having no luck, I tried different stores but they do not seem to have them yet, can you please tell me where I can purchase the wheel of fortune 2nd edition before I go nuts. It is a very good and interesting game."
3,Fortune,"I got bored with this game during the first two weeks, there was not enought variety, or real challenges. I purchase games all the time, other than restaurant empire, this one runs really close."
1,"If you enjoy Wheel of Fortune, DON'T BUY THIS!!","We own WOF 1 and have a lot of fun with it. So, we figured the 2nd edition would be even better, right? Wrong. Vanna looks like some 2-year-old cut her cardboard picture off a cereal box and pasted her on the cheesy, fake-looking background. The sound stinks, the game play is nauseatingly slow. I will say this, however. The graphics on the CD cover are pretty good, and the box itself has an attractive layout. It will look really good on the shelf of your computer desk -- which is where you will leave it when you uninstall it from your hard drive after you suffer through your first game."
2,incomplete,This game is incomplete! the $3000 toss up is not included as well as the final round where pat sajak spins to determine how much each letter will be in that round.
3,This edition forgot on minor detail the AI,"Ahhh... The Artifical Intelligence is something this game forgot, lets check out the PRO'S and CONS of this game.Pro'sMany puzzles over 2,500Vanna videosBetter wheelBehind the scenes exam/interviewsConsTHE AI, The computer players are so stupid because first of all they pick the most random answers like W,X,Y,Z. Also they buy all the vowels in the puzzles until they win all the money. They pick the vowels that you know aren't in the puzzle, like U.Their groans are annoying when they missMaybe Hasbro Interactive forgot that minor detail hopefully the new 2003 version will fix most of these problems, or not."
5,Awesome!,I bought this for my husband for Christmas! I think we have used this more than any small appliance we've ever gotten!! It's great! Even our teenage son has been getting some use out of it.
5,GREAT SANDWICHES,"I love this product. The Breville Panini Press can handle any type of bread. We just made proscuitto, goat cheese, and roasted pepper panini. Perfecto!! This product is very easy to clean after making a mess. We have yet to burn a sandwich. The floating plates make the job effortless. I would encourage buyers to take this product over the villa ware and krups panini makers.BUCKEYE PANINI MAKER"
3,Eh....,"Not bad. It works like it should, but the little plastic thing on the side, to adjust the depth, broke after about the 3rd or 4th time we used it. So it kept trying to make very flat sandwiches."
2,Breville Panini Press,"Loved this product and it worked well for about 2 years, then it started to smoke. One side stopped heating and it still smelled when I tried to use the other side. Feared I would have a fire, so I tossed it. We didn't overuse this product and I feel it should have lasted longer than 2 years! Bought a different brand and am hoping this one lasts longer."
2,Heads up on pricing....,"Just a heads up here on pricing for this panini press -For some reason Amazon is selling this Breville SG820XL Maxi 2-in-1 Panini Press for $149, but it is available for $79 EVERYWHERE else. Check online sources, Bed & Bath, and others.Sorry, I love Amazon,but something is VERY wrong here."
5,"Works great, looks great, taste great",This Panini press is as good as advertised. It is very convenient to use and my wife even lets me keep it out on the counter (at least for periods of time). I was concerned about the packing and shipping after reading all the posts of broken handles. Mine arrived in its box in another box with plenty of protective packing material and in two days from ordering. I would recommend this sandwich maker to anyone. It's a hit in our house.
5,delicious recipes,"This book is loaded with great recipes and information. And pictures, pictures, pictures."
1,Broken Handle,"Yeah, took a chance and sure enough, handle was broken when it arrived. Dang, win some, loose some."
3,not the Oprah Fav. Thing,"I ordered this, thinking it was the ""Oprah Fav. Thing"" pick (because the Oprah website directed me there) but this is not the one she had on the show. This one has flat grills and is different. Oprah said on the show her pick was available at Williams & Sonoma, so if you are looking for the Panini maker that was on the Oprah show, don't buy this one."
