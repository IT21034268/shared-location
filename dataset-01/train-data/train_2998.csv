1,"Wrong picture, wrong item sent","As another reviewer pointed out, the picture in this listing is a monaural adapter, showing only one band around the plug, where stereo plugs have two. I took a chance that the written description was accurate -- that this was a stereo 1/4"" to 1/8"" adapter. I needed it right away, so I had it overnighted.What I received was not only a monaural, not stereo, adapter, it wasn't even a 1/4"" to 1/8"" adapter. What I received was a mono-to-stereo 1/8"" to 1/8"" adapter.With this kind of uncertainty you might want to opt for a different item with a clearer, more consistent listing."
1,Wrong Product,I was sent a 3.5 mm to 2.5 mm adapter rather than the 1/4'' to 1/8'' (6.5mm to 3.5mm) adapter advertised.
1,Defective Item,"Audio 1/4"" to 1/8"" Stereo Adapter does not work. It's a waste of $4. I will not buy anything from EZ Electronic Mall."
2,sent me the wrong adapter..,"the company sent me the wrong adapter, an 1/8 to 1/8. clearly wanted a 1/4 to 1/8.amazon refunded my money. Later i ordered a different one from amazon.i had one like this before, they do the job."
2,im pretty sure i got the wrong adaptor...,"ok so im pretty sure i was looking for an adapter with a 1/4'' female to 1/8'' male... in other words, so i can plug my bass guitar into my computer... however i got a 3.5mm (1/8'') to a 2.5mm adapter... so... this sucks..."
4,it took a few tries,"i originally ordered three stereo plugs and they sent me three mono plugs. Since the price was so small, I decided to let it fly, but did write a not so good review. They immediately got back to me and said they'd send another order out. They did, but again they sent the mono plugs. This time i photographed them and showed them that they again sent the wrong plugs. The other day i finally received three stereo plugs. I appreciate the effort they made to correctly fulfill this order. They, apparently, had some issues with inventory (probably dumped mono plugs into stereo plug bin) but they did send me 6 of the mono plugs before sending me the correct order."
1,Adapter didn't work.,"I ordered this jack to be able to interface the 1/4-inch cable output from my guitar with a 1/8-inch input for recording. When I tried it out for the first time, my device didn't record any audio input. I pulled out an oscilloscope to see where the problem was, and after a few tests found that the adapter simply didn't work. The output of my guitar gave a proper signal, and I detected the same signal on the end of the 1/4-inch cable that I was inputting into the adapter. No signal was detected on the 1/8-inch male end of the adapter.I would not recommend purchasing this product."
2,misplaced goods,"I ordered this item in the hopes of adapting my headphones for use with a 1/8 inch port. instead, i got something else. what should have had a 1/4 inch female to 1/8 inch male connection instead had a 3.5mm (1/8 inch) female end, and a 2.5mm male end.so, i am now stuck with a near useless peice of equipment that does not accomodate my headphones in the slightest. admittedly, there doesen't seem to be anything wrong with the construction of the piece, and I ASSUME it works, but seing as how i don't have anything with a 2.5mm port, I WOULDN'T KNOW."
1,This produce did not work right.,"It didn't fit tight onto my headphones so I would have to hold it in place just right to be able to hear anything. Then after 2 days, it broke off in my computer. Definitely would not recommend."
1,Worst purchase yet,"OK, maybe I'm just being dramatic because I'm pissed. I got the right adapter, plugged it in, and it worked (just meh, though, nothing worth complimenting). I pull it out after about a minute of a test, and a piece of it had broken off and lodged itself in my headphone jack. Now my computer thinks that there are always headphones in, so the speakers won't play. Also, after I pulled it out, it separated from the plastic shell into a bunch of components. Obviously crappy quality, don't waste your time."
1,just like others - wrong item,"got a 1/8"" to 1/8"" jack instead of 1/4"" to 1/8"". Seriously? I should have read the reviews.Don't repeat the mistake!"
1,Ticked off,"It might be a great product, but the company sent me a 1/8"" to 1/8"" adapter instead of a 1/4"" to 1/8"" adapter. It's not worth the trouble of returning."
1,incorrect item description,"Received female 1/8 to male mini plug (1/16?)Assumed the order got mixed up, ordered again and got the same incorrect adapter.You are advertising the adapter as a 1/4 inch female to 1/8 male. This is not the correct description of the picture or of the item(s) that were shipped."
1,spout leaks,I purchased this Fire Marshal approved gas can so that I didn't have to deal with gas leaks or smells in my garage and the fuel leaks all over the place when trying to pour into the lawn mower. My father in law has 2 cans like this that he got 10 years ago and uses it for fueling his boat with no leaks at all.Tried contacting the seller for two months now with no luck.. Stay away from this thing.
2,Too Thin,These are not the noodles I was looking to use in my soup. I wanted something with a little more substance to them.
5,Awesome item for the cheap price!,"I would have to say this blanket is worth MORE than the retail price! For only $9 this blanket is super soft, durable and pretty. My daughter is 8 weeks old now, and I still swaddle her in it for comfort--she goes right to sleep."
5,My son's favorite blanket!,"I received this blanket as a shower gift! It's been my 3 year old son's favorite blanket since he was 8-9 months old! He has it next to him in bed every night and often wakes up hugging it. It's so soft and has held up well after many many washings! I even bought a second one, just in case something happens to the original!"
2,Not good for baby's health,"Many people at my shower had given me gift sets which included these super snuggly receiving blankets. At first, I loved them, because they were extra soft and kept the baby warm. But soon I learned that they needed to be washed a lot, because the smallest spot on them turns kinda hard and crusty :P Upon speaking to my pediatrician, she informed me that fleece was not good for breathing. The wool not only causes allergy problems with some people, and can trigger asthma attacks in babies who are prone, but overall you are breathing in fibers which is hazardous. She also advised ME not to sleep with a fleece blanket, or to use one for my dog."
5,"Great Blanket, Great Price!","Out of all the blankets that I purchased for my newborn son, this one was the least expensive an is our favorite by far. It's just the perfect size and is so soft. I've washed it a bunch of times and it still looks as is did when we first bought it. This is definatly a must have for your little one."
5,karl benjamin is my uncle,i also have the same first and last name as him. i really like this cd. its cool.
5,Play it Again...,"The passionate, image-evoking music of Buzz will relax your mind and lift your soul. An amazingly beautiful blend of sound, from the rich, smooth vocals of backup singer Zoe Ellis to the warm, soothing trumpet of Gavin Distasi. The intimate and penetrating lyrics of lead singer Tim Sawyer coupled with his incomparably euphonious voice ensure the longetivity of this band. This is an album you will want to listen to again and again."
5,AWESOME,"YOU GO BUZZ! Tell it like it is. The music and the lyrics fit so well together you can feel the emotion in every song. I hear a hint of Leon Russell in ""Because You"" yet T Sawyer's voice stands on its own. Hats off to the back up singers. You all blend well together."
5,Sportdog SD-400CAMO Training Collar,This is a well made (quality) product. The control unit is small compared to other manufacturers and models making it nice to put in your pocket or using the lanyard. Very happy with the overall performance. Unit comes with a lot of supporting information on recomendations for use (DVD and guide booklet). I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a reletively inexpensive dog training aid.
2,There's got to be something better out there!,"After a raccoon raid on my outdoor pond I ordered this product and have found it to be almost a joke as a pest deterrent. Not only is is ineffective, the direction page was of little or no value in assembling the barrier. It took several phone calls to the distributor and the manufacture rep to get the fence poweder up, only to find the the least little bit of debris cancels out the electrical charge which might deter some pests - certainly not the ones in my area. Save your money and get a product that has some ""bite"" to it"
1,"Incoherant, Misquoting, incomprehensible literature!","Many sentences are incomplete, and the author misquotes scripture. The majority of this book are quotes, assumptions, and fiction. He support the majority of minor issues and does not provide evidential support for his own opinions so the reader has no idea how he came up with them."
1,Dont buy this cd its crap,When I read what songs where on it I was happy. When I got I heard the songs and thought this isnt the singer. Sure enough it wasnt. The songs on this set are sung not by the original group but by someone awful if I knew then what I knew now I would never have bought the item.
5,"Beautiful Voice, Great Songs.","Title says all. I love the compositions, music, and her talent.Highly recommend to get all her CDs"
4,Not as Pictured,"The picture was of a round platter, but this is oval. Not a deal-breaker, so I kept it. Overall, it's a nice piece."
4,Love any of Betty's books,I love Betty Neels books and this one is no different. They are clean and I end up reading and re-reading them over and over again.
1,wrong product,they sent me the wrong product... this business does not even know their own dam products. Wasted my time and money
2,Poor quality,"The set looks nice and is lighter than it appears. However the quality of the product is very poor. The parts are cheaply made and don't fit well. The assembly instructions are clear but sometimes impossible to carry out. You'll need at least three pairs of hands to do it. The first chair took me about 20 minutes, the second one - about 10, the last two - about five minutes each. I assembled the last two in the order almost complete opposite to the instructions. One of the arrowbacks had dark spots all over it. The markings on the bottom of the table top for cross support (the part on which it rests) did not match the shape and size of that part and I had to draw my own. I was tempted to return the set but it had been packaged in foam to prevent scratching. The packaging is good to deliver the product to the consumer but impossible to reuse to ship back. I do not recommend this set."
4,Very strong lightener for darker hair,"I am a man with very dark brown hair. I always attempt the surfer look whenever possible to lighten up my image. Of the male-targeted bleaches, this is the strongest. It will turn my hair nearly white within 45 minutes-- very pale, without additional yellow dye. The Jerome Russell BBlond takes too long and has a yellow tint which gives my hair a nicotine-stained carpet look, which I hate. Feria is quite good also, but the glossy platinum finish (and the box) is a little too pretty for me. For best results, I use the DO-1 with a bluish tint or re-dye with a Just For Men for a natural-looking golden shimmer."
3,slightly faulty,didn't work so well only works through one speaker when i use it. Just a little disappointed in the quality but for the price it was still good.
4,Good Connecter,I like it. It works great you can plug it straight into the speaker jack and then right in to your RCA jack on your T.V its great for listening to music with. If your going to buy a cord like this one I would suggest you buy this one. And I got it in 3 days.
3,"""Erotic"" is a good word. But.....","First of all, I agree with another customer's evaluation. This should be rated ""X"". There most definately is alot to be seen of the women, and very little simulation if any of the sexual acts in general. None of them are a Pam Anderson, or Julie Strain. Victoria Vega, is the 10 in this one. The blonde is sexy and attractive at a distance. The close up shots upon closer examination reveal a scar of about five inches on her elbow, incisions for breast implants (all three women), and blondy has stretch marks from child bearing. Overall my wife and I found it entertaining. It receives a three star simply because of the really stupid looking guys, who looked and talked like refugee's from a mental insitution, and the ""ape costume"" had no significance to the movie. If your into serious ""girl on girl"" action, then this is for you. I enjoyed it overall."
3,Soft Steel,"The steel this hammer is made of seems quite soft.It very easily mars, when hammering even semi-soft material.The weight is good, but the steel quality is not very good.For the expensive price, I would shop around for a better product."
3,It's powder.,"It's powder. not foundation...so if you want foundation, you'll need to use foundation...then use their powder in addition.The powder is nice powder....really nice powder, but still powder...and they market it as foundation when it's not.Ooh, but the warmth is the best bronzer ever...and I expected the brushes to be crap based on other reviews....and they really aren't. I don't regret buying it."
5,So wonderful !!!,"I loved it. I discovered this product on TV two years ago when i spent one year in USA. At the time i didnt want to spent so much money for makeup (yes its kind of expensive).Two months ago i discovered in my body shop ""Sephora"" in France that they sell this product. I didnt think twice and i bought it. Since that time i have no complain to make. Its just great. Easy to do, i spent less on my makeup than before and the result is beyond my dream. You can do pretty much what you want with that product and the best things is so easy to remove. I used to spent time to remove my makeup before going bed and my skin was dry... now no problem with bare minerals.Buy it, you will loved it.Laets from France"
5,excellent,"This product is great. I have very fair skin and rosacea all over my cheeks. This product covers soo well, my rosacea disappears. My fellow employees are amazed that I am wearing makeup and it looks so good."
5,fast & easy! great coverage & younger looking skin!,"I find this makeup to be quick and easy to apply. It takes me no time at all to do my makeup anymore - just sweep it on and it's done.Plus, it always covers just enough and not too much. It feels like I'm not wearing any makeup at all. I have been carded numerous times since I started wearing it and I haven't been carded in almost TEN years. It is truly amazing! I really love this stuff.Unfortunately, I cannot wear the Mineral veil because I am allergic to it, but there is a money back guarantee and THEY pay for return shipping - no questions asked. Also, when I first ordered, I just guessed at what I thought seemed to be the right color; It wasn't quite right so I contacted them. They immediately sent me a different shade at absolutely no charge, not even shipping. Talk about great customer service...Their foundation is wonderful and, although the price seems high, I think that it is well worth it. I am SO glad that I tried it; I just love it."
2,Disappointed,I really did not like this product. I went from being a liquid foundation wearer to this and was very disappointed in the lack of coverage. I was attempting to use this as an alternate means of covering acne scars and uneven skin tones but the end result was yuck! I spent more time trying to apply and reapply to get the a similar result as the liquid foundation.I feel this product is better for someone with less problem skin.
1,Allergic Reaction- Bismuth Oxychloride in this Product,"After using Bare Minerals for a Saturday morning and a Sunday morning application I have a horrible sunburn-like dry itchy raw face for 3 days. I previously tried Cover Girl Mineral makeup and had the same reaction, but did not realize the connection until now. I have never had a reaction like this otherwise. Following research online-I discovered that many women suffer this same rash from the Bismuth Oxychloride contained in this product and some other brands like Cover Girl.For those with Sensitive Skin, I would suggest finding a brand without that ingredient. There are several brands that do not contain it."
5,A Dream Come True,"This truly is a dream come true! I've tried many types of makeup through the years, and had given up on using it. It had always looked fake, heavy, and unnatural. This stuff is FANTASTIC, quick, and easy to use. I'm 51, and it even looks light and fresh on me! It makes my skin healthy looking!! I JUST LOVE IT!"
2,Disappointed,"I really wanted to like this movie. I knew it was a lower budget productiuon and I also understand that the short book of Ruth isn't much material to make a full length movie. And to be fair, they did a good job of not straying too far from the Biblical text.However, the acting is weak and the script worse, really bad at points. Dan Haggerty is the only one who can deliver a line and he has just a few. The characters all look like the came from Iowa, not the Middle East. Little things like all the clothes looking brand new and clean make it look more like a Sunday school play than a modern period piece.With a little better directing and a few different actors, this could have been pretty good. Don't expect too much and you won't be too disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"Ruth is such a beautiful story and could be such a great movie, such as One Night with the King about Esther. This was poorly done. I am sorry I spent the money on it. I was so looking forward to it."
2,so-so,"This movie is probably more Biblically based than the older Hollywood version but feels rather trite and even somewhat tired in places. I received more inspiration from the older Hollywood version even though it was not exactly as the Bible describes it. also i am not really sure Carman should be doing acting, he tends to overplay some areas and be rather wooden at other times. Maybe he should stick to his wonderful singing and songwriting."
4,Loved It!,"Such a heartwarming story of Ruth, Naomi and Boaz. Characters and their reactions were carefully untainted and not exaggerated to rouse skepticism; the movie kept the integrity of the Bible account. I was so caught up in the story, acting did not come to question. Inspiring, moral and enlightening for many to enjoy."
1,Don't bother,"The production quality of this movie is shockingly bad and so is the acting. The acting is so terrible that it distracts you from the story. It's really really low budget. If you compare the production of the movie Jeremiah, Esther or Joseph for example which were excellent bible movies this is embarrasingly bad. It's such a pity because the bible book of Ruth is a beautiful account.The Book Of Ruth"
3,fair,"I have been leading a study on the book of Ruth (from the Bible)so I had been interested in comparing the film to the Biblical account. It seemed the producers of the film did intend to portray an accurate story line, which I appreciated. Yet, some of the interpretations of the Biblical text lacked some depth and knowledge of the broader Biblical context. The acting was fair and the costumes and sets were fair as well. I appreciate their efforts and can see how this film may be helpful in understanding the book for many people. I am still glad I bought it and will keep it, but did not love it, nor think it excellent."
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping to share this video with a group of gals who had just finished an 8 weeks study on the book of Ruth. There is much more depth to the story of Ruth then this video portrays. I found the make up and french manicured nails on Ruth and Naomi to be a total distraction. I would've much preferred a look truer to the times.There were two scenes that did a great job of bringing the story alive but too many others that fall into the creative license category. Again, I prefer a video that follows the Biblical text and does not create back stories and assumptions."
4,"great story, interesting heroine","This is a good mystery wrapped up in good writing. The heroine, a free-lance true crime writer, gets interested in the report of an accident because her attention is caught by one detail--the dead woman was in her nightgown. The side story, of a woman who is trying to live her life honestly as an Orthodox Jew in modern L.A., is equally compelling."
4,"Great for all the extra Command hooks I have laying around, but EXPENSIVE","One of the nice selling points about 3M Command hooks is that they're re-usable without making a mess on your walls...I've gotten to the point where I have so many Command hooks that I really don't need any more, I just need refill strips.Sure the 20-strip kit is fine, but the savings over just buying more hooks (and their accompanying strips) is pretty minimal. I bet 3M's profit margins on these are insane.Whatever. I love my 3M Command hooks and I'll keep buying...Well played, 3M!"
4,Nice book but a little dated...,I wanted to make a marionette of my own so I ordered up this book. Like the reviewers before me stated it's a good book for the money but it has 30 year old information. Many of the materials used in this book are really dated! Like using leather and shellac! I would have enjoyed it much more if the book was revised to include all the great new materials available today!
4,Interesting,A great read for people interested in the history of marionettes and other puppets and how to use them. Very informative and interesting. Would recomend for pupet fans.
1,Waste of Money,"The product only picks up certain screen images which may just be an ad on a site so it really does not help you know the actual sites someone actually visits. More importantly, the product is worthless in 30 days. You can not register it online or through phone support. The phone support is still on an answering machine message from July 2000 and nobody returns your call. The email address when it asks you to register does not work. They can be reached and they do reply but it must be a hired service that was paid for in advance. I have a product that does not work since it can't be registered. It is a total waste of money"
2,"Great Idea, but doesn't swing.","We bought this swing thinking how cool that it swings but detaches as a bouncer. A great plus in being able to move it around the house. It looks great and has good music/sounds but no matter what speed we put it on, it barely swings. The 6th speed setting is as slow as the 1 speed. We contacted amazon and they are sending a replacement. Hopefully it's just this particular swing and the next one will work great. Will update this review based off the next swing. Very disappointing, especially being a Graco product. We are looking at a Fisher Price model that got great reviews if this turns out to be a bust."
2,Wouldn't Buy This Again,"The swing itself is very nice looking, but that's about it. The speeds on ours for some reason don't work...it continues to stay in the lowest speed even when we repeatedly press the button for a higher speed. Because of this, we haven't used it much, and I'm pretty sure we'll be buying a different one for our next baby."
2,Not acceptable,I bought this swing for my daughter's new baby boy because it had several features that were neat such as the music along with the vibrating swing. Also the swing seat could detach and you could bring it anywhere. Unfortuately the swing itself won't stay swinging and that is quite a disappointment since I paid so much for this swing to do just that. I can't seem to get a hold of Amazon so that I can tell them that this swing is defective and am trying to get ahold of the vendor themselves. I am becoming pretty disgruntled because now several items I have bought from Amazon have been defective and they are not user friendly to contact.
1,Does not swing!,"For this swing being expensive, and Graco I thought it would be great, but boy was I wrong!! The bouncr is nice and the vibrating part works, but the swing does not. You press the setting and give it a push to start and the motor sounds like it is working, but the swing is not moving. I put it on a hard surface like it suggests and it still wont work. The nature sounds are also creepy. It sounds like airplanes over head or Godzilla pounding down the street. I am very disapoiinted! Do not buy this swing!"
1,No good,"I did not like anything about this chair once I got it. The baby did not fit in it right, could not see the items above it's head, it was horrible"
5,Very versatile swing!,"I am a teacher and I bring my baby to work with me. So, I needed something to put my baby in where ever I went that would work if she was awake, asleep or needed to go to sleep. This was the best purchase I could have made. It allowed me to rock the baby to sleep, then, move her from one room to another without waking her up. I use it outside and as a high chair during lunch time. It plays music, reclines to different levels and vibrates. This is my third child and this has been the best swing!"
4,swing and bounce is a good buy,"The Graco Swing 'N' Bounce is a pretty good buy. The price is nice because you get a swing and a bouncy seat. I have only used it for a week so this review may not be true in another month. The bouncy seat is great, he content with it. The swing is nice, but speed 1 doesn't work well. I'm not sure if it is because the baby doesn't weigh enough to keep it going but the rest of the speeds are fine. Also the legs have to be completely pulled as far as you can get them apart or the swing catches on the speaker and brings it to a stop. The music is nice, but the nature sounds are kind of annoying. It is like a static with some birds or water in the background. Taking the bouncy seat from the swing is very simple, not hectic at all. Putting the swing together is not that difficult, I would say it takes approx. 30 minutes. Overall I am satisfied with the swing and the bouncy seat so far."
2,works good but not as good as others,"We got this swing before our boy was born. It went together somewhat easily, a little confusing if you don't use the instructions. now 2 months old...Our son does not like this swing. He does not mind being in the bouncy seat part of it, but not for more than 10-15mins.The BADS: The pullover tray is very hard to close and keep closed (possible safety hazard). The vibrator on the seat is extremely loud. The plastic on the legs break after awhile. The seat is not perfectly lined up when on the swing. It swings crooked. The animals on top are too high for the baby to really see.The price is TOO high for what you get.We ended up listing ours on craigslist and cant get any takers.We bought the other kind of swing that allows the baby to swing sideways or forwards and is adjustable. Works much better."
5,Great value!,"I gave this swing as a gift. My sister loves the fact that it's a full sized swing, but she could remove the bouncer and move it from room to room, so she could have the baby with her."
2,Baby says BOOORING!,"I got this as a baby shower gift, I had asked for it because I had gotten the rest of the broadstreet collection. I thought it was great being a 2 in one. Once the little one came home she hates it. Still to this day I try to convince here to sit in it, I can't keep her in it for more than 2 minutes. The toys are boring and the music is not upbeat enough. She goes to grandma's house and LOVES that swing! It has swinging birds.Note to those new parents looking for a swing= Find something with upbeat music, some sort of toys that does something, and something colorful! I picked mine based on looks didn't think about what the baby would like best once it got here, big mistake!"
4,babies like it,Got this one for my babies and they really liked being in this swing. so i also bought for other friends. the babies liked the music and frequently fell asleep listening to it.
1,Rancho Deluxe,"This is a great story about two buds who just want their share or the modern west without working for it so they rustle cattle. It's a great film with wonderful actors, Jeff Bridges, Harry Dean Stanton, Slim Pickens, Elizabeth Ashley and wonderful music by Jimmy Buffett. However, at 93 minutes, a number of things have been cut out and the film suffers for it. I can't justify the thought of anyone making cuts to the movie unless it makes it better. For instance, Star Trek the Motion Picture would benefit if 20 minutes of camera pans were cut out of it. Here the cuts have been made to make the film safe for television, which means, someone else chose what is ""safe"" for you to watch. I'm sorry, but nobody needs to do that for me, but me. Buy at your own risk."
4,dvd purchase review,I was very pleased with this order. The movie was delivered in a timely manner and my brother really enjoys watching the dvd so it was in mint condition!
2,Don't throw out that VHS copy yet...,"First of all,I truly do enjoy this movie. Criticisims I have concern the DVD itself, not the movie. I figured that with such a low price we wouldn't be seeing much in the way of extras on this DVD. Boy, was I right! You get nothing but the trailer. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie in widescreen. The ""Widescreen"" referred to seems to be a matted, letterboxed type. You actually lose some of the picture, rather than gain it. The standard version won't even play in my DVD player, and I do not own one of the cheaper versions. The sound is low and muddy in some parts, and the picture ain't all that great either. Overall, I'm disappointed with the whole package. Not even a booklet inside the clamshell case."
1,Had To Throw It Away,"Although I rate it at the opposite end of the spectrum, I agree with the reviewer who says ""Either you get it or you don't,"" and I don't. I like the two stars a lot, and I love Montana, and--influenced by the favorable reviews--I bought this movie last week. Except for an exuberant sex scene, nothing really happens during the first third of the movie. After 40 minutes, I gave up, put the DVD back in its case, and threw it into the trash. I doubt if those fine actors look back on Rancho Deluxe with any fondness. For those who love this film, I'm glad you like it, but it doesn't work for me."
1,Truly a waste,"Some of my favorite actors, BUT if it wasn't so much trouble, I would send it back for a refund!"
1,"A Bad 70's ""Western""","Encouraged by many positive reviews, I purchased this DVD for viewing at a ""movie nite"" with a group of friends. Unfortunately, the film was a great disappointment - one of the least entertaining films I have seen, and often painful to watch. Even Slim Pickins couldnt save this artifact of the 70's. None of us found this film funny, and it is perhaps the only film in recent memory that was so awful and dated that I found myself hoping it would just hurry up and end starting painfully early-on in the film. Viewed on a 10' home theater screen, the video quality was only fair at best. Audio quality is similary only fair, and despite my like of Jimmy Buffet, his music did not make this film more tolerable."
5,"Amazing, but you need a very dry sense of humor.","How can I describe this movie in a nut shell? Odd and dated but with a very good heart- and dry dry dry!It is a pseudo-western, featuring actors who would now be too ""good"" for a small cultish movie like this one. Can you picture a Law & Order T.V. star in this?? This could be viewed as a great piece of 70's era B movie making with slumming A list actors. Or how about one of Jimmy Buffet's first appearances in popular culture- a must see for parrot heads!Listen for the one liners from Cecil (Sam Waterson), they could definately enter into your movie quote lexicon. Also, if you know any cowboys, watch it with them and check out their reaction to Cecil's Father's monolouge about the disease of ""pickup truck debt"" for which there is still ""no cure in sight"".Not likley to please everyone, this movie is for people with a twisted sense of humor but if you like stuff like Space Ghost you will love."
3,un libro con lagunas,"Es una hipótesis bien desarrollada pero poco sólida. El libro tiene grandes lagunas, como no mencionar los trabajos en Oxkintok de la Misión Española, cuyos datos son los más fiables actualmente sobre esa importante ciudad del norte. No creo que llegue a popularizarse la idea de los vínculos entre ciudades-estado y períodos temporales más allá del período final de la civilización. Por otro lado, hay interesantes cuestiones bien expuestas y problemas descritos con agudeza."
2,Not great,This broke a little while after I got it. I ended up buying one that snaps into a foam keychain from Target and I'm much happier with that purchase.
4,Wished for a better end,I think it would have been nice if the ending was more romantic ...it just sort of left you hanging.
3,Beauty and the breast retelling,"As the title suggest this is a retelling of Beauty and the beast. As far as the elemental masters series goes this one is not one of my favorites. I wish it would have done better. Everything seem pretty predictable and the villain(s) seem mediocre. The book does bring in eastern magic, though I wish more was done on this topic. Overall, only so so."
1,Dumb story,"So now I know the ""truth"" about the great fire of 1906...A more dumb story I`ve seldom read: A ""hero"" looking halfway like a wolf (the author didn`t even forget the tail). Spare me!"
3,Beauty and the Beast By Any Other Name,"I am extremely fond of Beauty and the Beast Tales. There have been several retellings out in the last few years. Some of them are excellent some have been very disappointing.I was looking forward to this version. I've enjoyed many of Lackey's books over the last few years.The beginning of the tale was wonderful, I enjoyed the setup, the meeting and the detail devoted to the world. Unfortunately as the tale progressed it began to feel more and more like the book was in a hurry to be finished. By the time we reached the promised dramatic ending, I was ready for some sizzling action. I was instead disappointed with a rather slapdash finish.I so wanted to love this book, instead I feel a bit letdown and offkilter.It is worth a read if you are longing to visit every version of the tale or are a die-hard Lackey fan. However you might find some of the other available versions more satisfying."
3,Average,"This book is almost good, but misses in a few vital areas. Number one, and most annoying, were the long, endless descriptions of absolutely everything. I finally started skimming the descriptive paragraphs to speed things up. The plot would stall for page after page after page while something insignificant was described. I had a hard time with the magic, since it didn't seem to serve any useful purpose except making those blessed with it wealthy. I didn't really like or respect the lead male character. And I only mildly liked the lead female character. The book was so highly rated on Amazon, I was eager to begin the series. But I doubt I'll read any more by the author."
2,Subpar,"The Fire Rose is a retelling of the Beauty and the Beast story. The Beauty is Rosalind Hawkins, a penniless bluestocking scholar in turn-of-the-century America. The Beast is Jason Cameron, a rail baron and Firemaster (aka magician), who performed a magical spell he could not control and was left in half-wolf form.Lackey, like McCaffrey, has an innate storytelling ability that keeps you reading even as you ask yourself why. The story was very choppy: slow in the beginning and then very hurried during the important parts so that you don't really identify with Rosalind's love for Jason. All-in-all, a disappointment."
5,Totally SpellBinding,"This Book was a real page turner for me... I couldn't put it down! I loved the heroine and hero in this book, even if he had to stay in his half wolf form. I can't wait for the other 2 books to come out (Phoenix and Ashes and The Gates of Sleep). ML has a way of taking you into the books she has written, feeling everything that the characters feel, and no sappy endings! I would recommend this book highly! I think if you like this book, you should most definatly check out Eyes of the Dragon by Stephen King!"
3,Kind of overdone,"I thought this book was cool the first time I read it, and even the second and the third...but it really doesn't hold up after that. The villains really are very one-dimensional, and even the two protagonists are sometimes shallow and artificial. I think the dialogue between them is often stilted and could have flowed a little better. An interesting retelling of Beauty and the Beast, but go to Robin McKinley for more depth."
2,Dissapointing,It went very quickly from potentially interesting to very predictable. I have been reading Lackys books for years and I suppose I came to expect more.
5,I love this book!,"I love this author in general, and this is based on my favorite fairy tale. Mercedes Lackey's writing is smart but still fun and relaxing."
2,Breezy and Light...a little too Breezy,"While I enjoy Lackey's work, I found this one to be quite a disappointment. The characters seemed undeveloped and inane. It fit more into a gothic romance genre than fantasy even though it had its fair share of sorcery.The book was overall entertaining though. My biggest complaint is the climax. It just seemed to rush by too fast...almost as if Lackey was being timed by the clock to wrap it up quickly. As a result, the end leaves you with an unsatisfied feeling at the pit of your stomach and a whirlwind of thoughts which make you wonder, ""What the heck just happened?""Oh well...although this book didn't live up to my expectations for Lackey, I will still continue to read her works."
4,Beauty and the Beast,"This sets the tale of Beauty and the Beast in San Francisco around the time of the great earthquake and weaves all the elements you have come to expect from the Elemental Masters stories into it - unorthodox heroine, respectful-of-women hero, juxtaposed against depraved, bad men who are destroying the world in one way or the other. OK, I must like that story line cos I keep buying these. Only criticism is that the book seemed unfinished somehow, could have been fleshed out a little more, particularly at the end."
4,Good Review Book,Overall a nice supplement for the boards - it seems to have enough variety and not come straight from the Chern review book. Pictures are decent - not all in color yet. Gives nice explanatations to answers.
5,Great study tool,Really helps define the most important information to study for OKAPs and came highly recommended by those who have taken the test previously
2,Review Questions in Ophthalmology: A Question and Answer Book,"This question book used to be the standard one that every Ophthalmology resident and/or fellow bought to prepare for his or her OKAPs and Written Board examinations. Though not bad, the questions are somewhat outdated and there are many typos littered throughout the book. I prefer to use online questions ""books"" such as ophthoquestions.com and occasionally even the AAO's ProVision service. I just don't think this book is worth $100 anymore."
5,best question book...hands down!,"Of all the question books out there, these are the most similar to OKAPS and the most high yield. I find the Mass eye and ear questions too detailed and other such books don't even come close to this classic. Use it for boards and okaps. Pictures and explanations are second to none. As an aside, I hear there may be a new edition in the works. May want to wait for that but I'm not certain."
3,My Stars could be more valuable than average,"The book consists of 540 pages, excluding introduction and appendix. I have just read the chapter 1. It is wordy, fit for beginner. The section 2 for database is more in detail, but the section 3 for Object Oriented is weak. As most of the writers, the author is exhauted at the last chapters, the section for advanced readers. Anyway, $45 is affordable for the content. Do not count for advance features and OO in it."
2,Look for a better book!,"I gave this book a 4 star review after finishing the first 6 chapters. Now that I have ""attempted"" to complete 4 aditional chapters, I am lowering my rating considerably. I must agree with several reviewers who were disappointed with the lack of source code...No CD...No website to download it from. Even a written request for source code resulted in a letter from the publisher which Is is enclosed in quotes below:""In summary, I'm sorry that you're still having trouble with the book, but I don't think answering your specific questions is the right solution. Believe me, all the answers are in the book or in online help. You've just got to look for them.""After this response I returned this book for a refund. I then discovered John Connells book on database programming with Visual Basic 6, which is an excellent book that I highly recommend."
4,"Good content, but some lapses in code","I used this book to help teach some young students the basics of VB. It provides a good listing of the VB environment and the ""bells and whistles"" as another reviewer mentioned, but did have some code areas that appeared to be missing the correct code. As far as getting one through the core starting areas for VB 6, this book provides a good start, even with the occasional missing code. I would rate this as a good place to start, but once you get your ""chops"", you will be ready for something a little more thorough and in-depth."
2,"No way ""to pro""","The book claims ""it takes a beginner to a pro"". No way. For beginner only. Compared to several other VB database books out in the market, the book is quite shallow. I recommend VB database how-to from waite and Database Access with Visual Basic 5 by Macnamus. Don't expect much real-world programming from the book. The sample applications are too simple."
1,Publisher takes reader for a fool,Publisher has tried to increase number of pages by wasting lot of space. This book could have easily been printed on less than 300 pages instead of 600+. And over that half the book is wasted on to explain IDE. So the real content is only 20 percent . This book comes without CD so no text searches. I wouldn't pay $20.00 for this book.
5,If you program for a living. You need this book,"Ignore Dan Burton from New York,USA review. Gee Dan if it does not have a Cd, how about going up to the website? What a concept. This book gives a fair treatment to ADO and some basic concepts of how to program. After reading the user should be able to create basic business oriented programs in VB. This book was laid out well as it was written for training purposes so you can teach out of it or use it for a training course. If you want something practical that gives REAL WORLD business examples buy this book"
1,"Great for beginners, but not for anyone else.",The reviews made this book sound easy to read and would explain things clearly. I found it choppy and completely disconnected. Only the newest of newbies will get useful information from this book. Anyone with any experience will find it an over simplified review. That is so discontinuous as to remove any chance of a unified learning experience. Look elsewhere for a good beginning book
4,Best female vocalist ever?,"This is a legendary release. The vocalist i think were only 17 years old at the time of the recording, but her growling chrushes mine. Musically it's doom/death. Heavy sound and good production. Realesed in 1995, and should be in everyone's collection."
2,Gimmick,"I love slow sludgy doom as much as the next guy, but the fact remains that this record is a very boring, one-dimensional, one-trick pony. All it really has going for it is the sheer novelty factor of Runhild. Once the whole cute factor of this beautiful girl growling wears off you realize that she has absolutely no pitch definition whatsoever, every sound she makes is exactly the same as the one before with the only variation being the length of the growl. So who really cares if her looks belie the sound she makes? This stuff is incredibly boring to listen to and it's only enjoyable for about the first song. After that it's just an annoyance. I wanted to like it, and certainly there are talented people in the band, but you can do much better in this genre of music. This one's little more than a gimmick."
5,Valve Stem Tool - Excellent Transaction,"Who ever thought I'd need a vavle stem tool in Iraq?? Well I did and this transaction was excellent. The valve stem tool arrived to me here in Iraq at my APO address in a reasonable amount of time and the price was reasonable. I'd have no problem with future purchases from the vendor again. Review by Mark Grant, author of Blood of Scotland, available through Amazon.com or Publish America"
4,Did the trick,"I got this to be able to stream (online) a local radio station, at their request. I used this to go from the headphone jack on the stereo to the line in jack on the streaming PC. The quality is good and sound quality is great for the low quality stream I produce. The length of the wire was just right for my application, not to short but not to long either.M"
3,You get your money's worth,"I got this cable to connect my Zune MP3 player to my car's AUX port. It is way too long for my needs, but it was very cheap, so I went ahead and got it. I have been using it a couple times a week for a little over a year now and it's now breaking down. I only get sound out of one channel. So, I need a new cable. I may actually buy this one again since it's so cheap."
2,dutiots worst recording!,"this is the only recording of all Dutiot/Montreal cds that i didnt care for to much,he goes about the symphony in a very straightforward manner witch is unlike his style.though the choral works he does fine but there not first rate works to me.i still think eugene ormandys/phil symphony version is one of the best around."
1,New York Times crossword answer book,"There wasn't a description about the book, other than it was an answer book. All it has is possible letters to fit your puzzle. I thought it would be like a dictionary, and would give words to answer the puzzle clues. I don't like it at all!!"
1,Finding theTrail,All the solutions are there. What is the organization to quickly find the appropriate known letter positions? The book lacks any explanation as to how to look stuff up.
4,Review Of Biology: The Study of Life,"this book is used a high school textbook, and has repeatedly shown itself useful over and over.the information is presented in a user-friendly way, and information can be easily accessed. the book also has a lot of pictures and graphs, which make it easy to use.information is arranged in an orderly manner, and by correlated subjects.there is also appendices at the back for quick information at your fingertips.the content is mediocre. there are not that many specifics, and information is usually in generalities. rare are the in-depth researches and studies of a certain subject.the book is easy to read, and the fact that it has a lot of images helps. it is written in a manner which can be easily understood by people. the only drawback is that there are not many specifics.this would prove useful as a reference for students all over the world."
5,para ver y reveer,"por fin un material para poder mostrar, los que hemos visto en las plantas de Toyota y que siempre teniamos que explicar con dibujos."
4,more then I expected,I got this for my husband as a birthday present. It has more types of bits then I think we will ever need. It is a great product for the price. I love that it is compact and easy to store to take where you need to go.
5,"Brilliant, beautifully-written, tough, and timeless.","It is difficult to praise this book sufficiently. Henry Fairlie's 1978 book has thankfully been reprinted by the University of Notre Dame Press for a new generation. Fairlie presents the Seven Deadly Sins--Pride, Envy, Anger, Sloth, Avarice, Gluttony and Lust--as they manifest themselves in contemporary Western (especially American) society and in individual lives. Whether or not one is religious in orientation (Fairlie characterized himself as a ""reluctant unbeliever"")this book offers a disciplined optimism in suggesting that ""The understanding that we sin is a summons to life."""
5,A Very Special Bird Toy,I don't know what it is about this bird toy but even my elderly cockatiel plays with this. I have three of these toys so the two smaller parakeets don't have to share with the cockatiel. The toy is simple but with its various hanging strings and wooden ring it very much interests my birds. I looked everywhere to find the Stick and Staxs toys and was delighted to order them from amazon. Is best for smaller birds.
1,Did not get the black color I wanted.,My dress was ruined as it turned a purplish gray color when I used this dye. And I went and got another bottle -- the dress then had tie-dye on it!
5,Bottle all the way.,"the bottle is the best way too go with RIT Dye, its easy and not hard at all to work with. totally worth it to get the bottle instead of the box. RIT is the best for Dye"
3,Follow the directions,"I used this dye to dye a pair of Black True Religions; it didn't work. I think this is because I did not follow the directions; I did not steep the jeans for the required time (whoops!). Also, rinse the pants after dying them; do NOT put them in the washing machine! I had to run my washer TWICE before all the dye was gone!"
3,"excellent dye, not excellent price","I've always had good results with Rit liquid dyes. However, the price here is quite a bit higher than elsewhere on the web."
2,oops!,"made stuff grey n smelly, not black. probably made of yucky chemicals-- check out this link:[..]not sure whether it is a good thing that they mention astm-d? but made me think maybe won't do it again till i know more."
5,works great,Works great on training my daughters dogs and keeps them in their yard where they belong also works well on people who forgets to turn them off and walk out of the yard
5,Works excellent for our malamute,"Works great with the Sportdog in ground fence. We needed an extra collar for our malamute, and this one fits the bill. He now has the freedom to run around outside as much as he wants, and it only took hime a week to understand how the flags and fence worked. Awesome!"
5,Not disappointed,"Have had this product for nearly one year and have had no issues with it yet. We bought this collar for the second of our two dogs when we installed the SportDog invisible fence. I was worried the dogs wouldn't like the collar but once on, they adjusted quickly."
4,SportDog,"Sport Dog Collar works perfectly. The original one lasted 3 years before Walker(dog) jumped into the pool with it. Although it is supposed to be water tight it shorted out. The new one we put on is evidently water tight, Walker again jumped in with the collar on(2x) and it still works. I wouldnt suggest letting it on while swimming but it should be alright until you get in to take it off when they accidentaly jump in before you."
5,A wonderful compliment to a wonderful series,A beautiful soothing soundtrack that transports to the Highlands. Although there are some music cues I wish were on the soundtrak (most involving Hector) it's still great.
1,Monarch of the Glen: Music from the BBC TV Series,"I LOVE the TV show, and would like to get a copy of the soundtrack. I can't find it anywhere. Would someone be able to tell me where I can find it?Thanks"
5,ESTUPIDO Y CREIDO,"THIS SONG WAS NICE CACA...NEVER HEARD SOMETHING LIKE IT. I GOT TWO JUST INCASE THE OTHER ONE GET SCRATCHED...I TRIP ON THAT SONG MUST HAVE BEE CUZ I WAS GRIFO...NICE BETTER THAN AKWID, DONT GET ME WRONG I LOVE AKWID BUT THIS SONG ITS NOTHING LIKE IT AKWID'S ALBUM IS GOOD BUT THIS SONG IF THE HOOK FOSHISHLE MY SNEEZLE"
1,Movie tape unable to watch,The movie was mesed up...would not work but 5 mins here and there clearly. It rolled and sound constantly in and out. I really wanted this movie to be added to my collection because it is a great movie and story that I remeber happening in our small little home town. I am really dissapointed in my purchase.
4,Good movie.,"I saw this when it first aired, and then again as a repeat on Lifetime or something. It's really quite good I thought. The actors for Chris Pritchard and James Upchurch were very intense I thought and did really well. Ed Asner is always fun to watch too... anyway its a great movie. And for some clarification because none of the other reviews mentioned it... yes this is the one where the kids get all whacked out on drugs, alcohol, and D&D to go off one of the kids parents. It's portrayed well in this film... its just sad that its true."
1,I thought the film was very dissapointig.,"The film was way to dull. I personally thought it was poorly made. The film seemed to be made as cheep as possible. To sum it all up, it sucked!!!"
3,I Love Music but...,"This was not exactly what I expected, but it was easy to listen to. It is not one that will be played over and over . I'll wait a season and try it again."
3,Buena calidad,Me parece que el ejemplar del libro en cuestión cumple con las condiciones de un libro nuevo. Esta en buen estado y el envío fue realizado rápidamente.
2,From which it follows that....,"According to the NYT review ""Offering what they call a cultural theory of risk perception, the authors suggest that peoples complaints about hazards should never be taken at face value. One must look further to discover what forms of social organization are being defended or attacked.""Applying this logic, we have to ask what Mary Douglas and Wildavsky have to gain from advancing this argument...and their consistently dismissive and condescending attitude toward environmentalists makes this fairly clear. If your unenlightened opposition INSISTS on talking about certain risks AS IF that was what REALLY mattered then you are, of course, completely justified in disregarding their point of view, (and for that matter them) entirely.Now THAT's a payoff..."
1,The Author Lacks Sufficient Knowledge of Spanish,"The author attributes many pronunciation contractions to Chile whereas these can be found in Caribbean or European Spanish, depending on the social class of the speaker and the lack of formality of a situation. The author concentrates on ghetto Chilean Spanish and I am not likely to frequent the few violent neighborhoods or participate in illegal activities. I have been to Chile and I have always used my standard Latin American Spanish and everyone answered me in kind. This standard is the result of soap operas and international programs in Spanish which use the most neutral accents and vocabulary. I have never had the impression that Chileans were using their best Spanish to communicate with me. This book is worthless to me."
5,Great tool for Anthropology,I got this book for my best friend but is great book if you are in the Anthropology area.
4,"You know you can't quit me, black woman!","Great sound for an old recording. Lightnin' bends the meter, Lightnin bends the pitch, Lightnin bends it all!I have an older version without the extra tracks."
4,Informative History,"This is an easy to read, well researched history of modern psychoanalysis. The authors start out with an introduction that gives the reader an important overview and a foundation on which to build an understanding of recent developments in psychoanalysis. Well worth reading."
3,Not nearly technical enough,"I was never really interested in trading, but wanted to learn a bit about it so I decided to pick up a copy of this book since it looked like it might bridge the gap between investing and trading. The writing style is very accessible and the authors clearly discuss the diferences between trading and investing. In this respect, it met my expectations. However, I felt that the book was nothing more than a set of ""rules of thumb"" that were cobbled together in a book. I certainly enjoyed the read, but the lack of well defined rules makes me reluctant to try the methods discussed. I was even more disappointed to find that the authors mention that these methods are ""statistically proven"", but never present any of these proofs. If you are interested in learning more about trading this book might be worth a quick read, but I'd recommend finding something more technical if you really want to take a quantitative approach to trading."
3,Good introduction to day trading,"If you are unfamiliar with day trading, then this book provides a solid conceptual overview for you. If you already know the basics and are looking for something with more specifics and greater mathematical vigor, then this isn't the book for you.The book is well-written and easy to read. The continual focus on using computers and the Internet got to be tiresome, but this is primarily due to my background in both subjects. Others should find his coverage of these topics worthwhile.Overall, a nice intro book that leaves a craving for more detailed information. Hence, this is not a book I would carry around as a reference or a guide."
4,A Revelation,"If you're just an investor..or even someone who THINKS he's Day Trading now, this book will be a ""revelation"" for you! I compare it to how when you were young and you thought you knew all about the game of baseball, just to find out later about all the little ""nuances"" that are used in the professional game. And the main thing they stress is not so much making money...but not to LOSE it! READ IT!"
2,The Long-Term Day Trader,I have read over 75 books on trading and I can honestly state this book is out of date. It still uses fractions in price quotes. I almost quit reading the book during the first section. Anyway I got through the first section and was glad I did... The best part of the book was the middle section on trader's rules. I did not like the interviews very much. I would recommend New Market Wizards by Jack Schwager for interviews with great traders. All in all I would not buy this book given what I know now.
5,Make the transition,Nice tips and hints on making the transition from a long term investor to trader
2,BELOW BEGINER LEVEL,"THIS BOOK WAS NOT USEFULL TO ME. IF YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW THE BEGINERS INFORMATION IN THIS BOOK, YOU HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO."
3,A little less than advertised,"The wealth of Career and stat-tracking features is a plus, but I was very turned off by the gameplay and graphics. If more attention was put into the presentation of the graphics and ease of gameplay this would be a real winner."
1,Very Disappointing,"This game promises the best of both worlds, great gameplay for those who like the arcade style action and great management for those who enjoy running the team. While the gameplay was decent it pales in comparison to some of the other top baseball games available. The general manager mode is supposedly based on Baseball Mogul. While it may be it lacks any of the depth found in Baseball Mogul. The statistics in this game are anemic. You can't even pull up a box score for simulated games. For those of us baseball fans who have been waiting for a game with great action and management ... the wait continues."
3,"Entertaining, Replayable Game","The graphics are decent, the playing is lots of fun, but the stats could be better. As a hardcore baseball fan, I want slugging percentage ect... It is, however, a thoroughly entertaining game to play and the realism is top notch. Not the best on the market, but well worth the price."
3,commendable; but needs the guidance of an editor,"The authors should be commended for walking the Camino de Santiago and for recording their experiences in a journal.Be forewarned, however, that this book is self-published and therefore has not had the assistance of a professional editor. At times, typographical errors and lack of cohesion becomes troublesome to the reader. Further, the book is indeed little more than excerpts from the couple's journal, much of it mundane.Their story, perhaps, could have been much more compelling had the authors reflected back on the camino using their journal notes, evaluated the totality of their experience, and then scripted the story accordingly using a different organizational approach. The day by day, journal format slows down the narrative considerably.To its credit, however, the book does give the reader a good sense of the day to day activities that pilgrims face while hiking to Santiago."
3,Solid Science Fiction,"T.S. Buckell is going to be added to my short list of worth while science fiction writers - especially impressive since the ""science"" was very light (in a good way) - and is an engaging story teller."
2,Save your money,"I had high hopes for this one based on the reviews above, but apparently his mama wrote them. The situation had so many improbable circumstances it was ridiculous, and the wierd dialect being spoken was not helping. The used prices tell the tale - if friends were telling friends to get it as they do on a Drake, Weber or Glen Cook book the prices would be much higher. The book is just not a keeper."
2,Mediocre at Best,"I found this novel interesting enough to read all the way to the end, but just barely. The broken English of the Carribean-culture islanders was distracting and made the dialogue a chore instead of a delight.The first page of the first chapter contains what is probably the WORST similie I've ever read in any published work, and it doesn't improve much from there. Descriptions are flat and predictable and so are characterizations. There's no theme to speak of other than, possibly, ""War is hell"" or ""Religion is stupid"" and the defeatism of the conclusion is Naturalism at its worst.And what on earth is this Carribeans vs Aztecs motif illustrating? It's like he chose the two most obscure cultures he could find in order to make the book interesting.Don't pay full price for this book."
4,Don't miss out on Crystal Rain,"Tobias Buckell's first novel is an awesome science fiction novel, full of: swash-buckling adventure, steam punk, nanotechnology, and even a star ship.More importantly, the characters have depth, seem plausible, and captivated my interest. And they're not all white! Actually, most are shades of brown (being either Aztec or Afro-Caribbean).The preface to this book intrigued me, but then the first thirty pages seemed to drag. I started wondering if this was really a fantasy novel, and a bad mish-mash of cultures. I kept reading, however, for the promise of the preface, and was rewarded in spades, as the steam punk kicked in, adventure kicked into gear, and explanations that made sense were provided.I'm looking forward to reading his second book,Ragamuffin (Sci Fi Essential Books)."
2,minus the bear for president!,This album makes me want to listen to Menos el Oso. it reminds you how good the songs really are.
3,Popular administration in Latin America,"In this book, Sader gives a good overview of Erudina administration of Sao Paulo City, Brazil 1988-92. The administration caught the city in much bad shape. It was financially bankruptcy, and many areas such as of transportation and health need urgently investment. Erudina faced not only these challenge, but also a state and federal government which were unwilling to undertake their constitutional roles of providing support for the local municipal government. Sader goes over how Erudina faced all these challenge and her own party, that expected a revolutionary and innovative administration. It a good book to understand the urban challenges that a progressive Party and candidate face, when they go into power."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you have any sewing experience at all, don't bother. I was expecting extraordinary outfits (that is what the title Baby Couture implied) and all that is in this book is ho-hum. If you want to create fabulous clothing for the little ones in your life, get the magazine Ottobre Design, you'll be happy you did!"
5,great book!,"I really enjoyed the projects, especially the vintage inspired ones. The directions were clear and easy to follow, and there are lots of how to photos."
5,Grandmother of five,I really enjoyed this book! The directions were easy to follow and the book was beautifully photographed. I used Baby Couture to make birthday presents for my twin grand daughters.
1,Cute kids...,"That's about the best thing I can say for this book. I was greatly disappointed with the content and wish I could just send it back but the puppy ate it. Don't waste your money get Ottobre, great patterns trandy fashion and I promice you'll get a lot more out of it."
1,"Nothing resembling ""COUTURE""","Oh my, how I wish that I had read - and heeeded - the negative reviews for this book BEFORE I wasted my $5 on a copy on online auction. Even that small amount was far too much and I will probably throw it away. To give credit where it is due, the cover picture is lovely."
2,nice for beginners,"This book has some cute ideas but the patterns are very, very basic--good for beginning sewers but probably not advanced or even intermediate sewers. Many of the patterns (pants, jacket, bib) are presented as different items in the book. In reality, they are the same pattern made from different fabrics with slightly different construction techniques. There are some cute ideas for embellishments--fabric yo-yos, flowers, and covered buttons. Wait for Jo-Anns 99 cent pattern sale--you'll get many more patterns for your money."
2,"Cute, but not very clearly written","I have sewn many, many costumes and dresses for my children, so I am not a rank beginner. Even though the patterns look simple enough, they are poorly labeled on the pattern sheet or poorly drafted. I think the items are cute..except for the ghastly pillowcase top. The little pants and the jackets are very cute. Children's clothing doesn't have to be complicated to be adorable...still, I have enormous reservations about the fact that the pattern pieces labeled jumper front and jumper back don't appear to match... good idea book, but if the patterns aren't going to line up, don't spend $22 bucks. Find a really steep discount."
1,Um not what i thought,the last review i read about this book b4 i bought it said it was modern stylish baby clothes. NOT! an old lady must have wrote that. its simple cheap looking baby clothes im going to return this book.
4,Baby Couture,This is a great book for thinking outside the box about different fabrics to use for baby clothes. I have gotten some wonderful ideas.
5,FAMU-Cholly,"This is an EP version containing 6 of the 13 songs on her debut album ""Gold Coast.""Rhians skills as a composer, arranger, lyricist and producer shine through on this collection of songs. They really are well written and if you are into Neo-Soul you'll LOVE this CD."
5,Brilliant account of the new diplomacy,"If you think international diplomacy is an obscure art practiced by cynical men in grey suits, think again. Axworthy's book chronicles the rise of a new way of conducting international relations, one based not on fear and might, but on humanity, democracy and civility -- principles which all Canadians hold dear. The chapter on the process to ban anti-personnel landmines is a particularly inspiring example of how governments and civil society can work together to overcome an urgent humanitarian crisis. Axworthy peppers his essays with the fascinating inside stories behind the official accounts. This page-turner is an eye-opener to the real world of international relations and diplomacy. But don't take my word for it, read the ""Editorial Reviews"" - each gives Axworthy's book an excellent review."
3,"Looks nice, poor hardware","I was happy with the look of this set when it arrived, but it had two problems. First, one of the packages was open and 1 screw and 2 drywall anchors were missing. Fine, we have that around. Second, as my husband installed two of the included drywall anchors in the wall they broke apart in his hand. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the toilet paper roll accessory is quite close to the wall- Allowing it to hold only the smallest toilet paper roll. All things considered, its a good looking, average quality ensemble. Comes with a 15 year warranty."
5,She should have been a massive star,"The ""Whats'a Matter baby"" album contains some of the best bluesy material Timi recorded in the sixties. If you listen to hear holler through Ray Charles' ""The Right Time"", you will be blown away. Where this huge voice came from such a petite lady nobody will ever know. Mike Rossiter"
4,The true family story of the Walker Spy Case,"Well written ""real"" story by the daughter of spy John Walker. She tells the true story behind the news stories and other books about John Walker. Her father tried to recruit her into the spy business as well as her brother. She says they were desperate for his affirmation. She declined, but her story was not over as her son was taken by her ex-husband, and it took the FBI to get him back. One thing led to another, and her father was finally arrested. ""My father was a very evil man,"" she said to me once."
4,good,"Good for minor cushioning, but if you have plantar fasciaitis then you should get a Dr. Scholl's orthotic. I will likely continue to use the metatarsal cushions in my shoes with a slight heel WITH my orthotic."
4,It works,I used it on a trip that involved a lot of walking. It did not relieve all of the pain but it did help take some of the pressure off.
3,It'll Do,"Well, I personally didn't think too much of this album, really. I bought it a few years ago, and i listened to it the other day again. Well, here's my analysis. ""Simple Life"", ""Runaway Train"", ""The North"", ""Whitewash County"", and ""The Last Song"" are the only songs I'd really give standout status, especially the final one. That last one is just so heart-felt and geniune. It's one of my favorite Elton songs from the 90's for sure, but songs like ""Emily"", ""Sweat It Out"", ""Understanding WOmen"", ""When A Woman Doesn't Want You"" just don't do anything for me; it just seems so mediocre and unfelt. I don't know, I think ""Reg Strikes Back"" kills it, but Elton fans should check it out, it's worth the money."
2,"A fantastic song and a good one, but that's all","The fantastic song is ""The one"", one of the best from Elton.The good one is the opening track ""Simple life"" but that's all !The other tracks are totally forgettable. I respect Elton for his earlier works and he will remain a great artist forever, but not for this album as far as I am concerned."
4,Get Made In England first..,"then pick up this CD. It's very good, but Made In England is a bit better. I loved the first half of this CD. Simple Life and The One are beautiful songs with thoughtful lyrics and great melodies to back it up. Runaway Train is brilliant. Sweat It Out is a fun rocker. The ballads on here don't work as well, with the exception of The Last Song (which I admit I didn't like initially), although they grew on me over time. The quality of the music, lyrics and Elton John's voice are high as usual. A few songs just started to sound a little too similar, and overall it took me a little longer to warm up to this album than it did Made In England. Still, it's one of his better recordings from the late 80's/90s time period, and it's definitely a CD you need if you're a fan of either the artist, or just of adult mid tempo music."
2,barely work,"This amplifier improves signal, but by only a little. I cannot find its noise level from the product or its package. Noise level is a very important number for an amplifier. When buying an amplifier, make sure to buy one with low noise level and you can return it when its does not work for your situation."
5,Why Techno Bears are the Best.,"1. The flavor is not too sweet.2. The flavors and colors are many, they are not boring! They are shiny too... they could keep a toddler engaged for hours.3. They are perfectly chewy. They don't just gel in your mouth like mush. If you like to work for your food a little (maybe you are trying to stop smoking or chewing your fingernails?)then these would be perfect for you.4. 5 pound bag!? Need I say more?"
4,Nice taste from the original Haribo,"I usually eat the regular Haribo gummy bears, these were nice even though I couldn't stand the blue ones. A nice deviation from the regular ones with that same ""haribo gummy"" taste that I love!"
3,Techno Bear by Haribo,I liked them in general. The flavor of the bears leaves something to be desired. The purple bears had almost no flavor what so ever. My co workers did not seem to mind they consumed the bulk of them. I would buy them again if I could get a fresh bag.
2,"Way, way too gummi.",Way too gummi. Chokes little kids. My grandkids loved the flavor buthad difficulty chewing and swallowing them (they are ages 7 and 4 and normallydo not have problems with gummi candies).
5,So Perfect!!!,"I bought these for the candy table at my sister's wedding reception. These were a hit for so many reasons. First, the theme was peacock, so the colors and slight metallic shine went well. Second, my sister LOVES gummy bears. Third, a fun little play on the name, techno bears at a reception with techno music. This candy had to be refilled the most, it was so unique with all the other ""normal"" candies. Plus I must have ordered these a month before the wedding and they were still fresh and chewy when opened. I would highly recommend these to anyone, did at the reception with so many people asking where I found them."
5,The Best Gummies,These are the best gummies that i have ever ate. Now when i get a bag my entire family wants to eat them all. 5 lbs doesn't last long at all.
5,Best Gummy Bears!,These gummy bears are a bit more dense and chewy than most other bears but that's why they are so good. My family and friends always ask for some when they come by. You got to pick up a bag for yourself!
4,Delicious!,"The gummi bears themselves are not as tough as some reviews mention. If you've had Haribo Golden Bears, they are about the same degree of toughness.The packaging I received from Amazon lacked nutritional information, and I was curious what the calories/techno bear worked out to be (don't blame me, some people are on a diet around here). I came to 12.5 calories/bear. My math follows.Haribo estimates there are 665 bears in the bag, which weighs 5 pounds. A pound is ~454 grams. On our home scale, two techno bears were 7 grams, so 3.5 grams/bear. (5 pounds times 454 grams/pound = 2,270 grams. 2,270 grams divided by 3.5 grams/bear = ~648 gummi bears, so the math is almost right). The Haribo website lists the mini Golden Bears at 150 calories in 42 grams, which is ~3.6 calories/gram. Thus, 3.6 calories/gram times 3.5 grams/bear = ~12.5 calories/bear."
3,Not bad..,"They weren't nearly as pearlescent and metallic as they appeared in the picture. The flavors aren't bad, but they aren't anything to write home about, either."
3,These are just average,"They taste good, but I think they do not match up to many of the other products Haribo have they do not have much flavor."
1,"I didn't get Techno Bears, I got standard Haribo bears","The product I got, the standard Haribo Golden Bears, get five stars. I didn't order Haribo Golden Bears, I ordered the Techno Bears. Pretty disappointing, be careful about ordering."
3,Blue taste's horrible,"Most of the flavors are okay, except for the blue which in the batch I received was either okay or absolutely unpalatable. The taste ranged from sweet-sour to bitter. The quality control is lacking. The rest of the flavors were okay, but I'm going to stick with the gold bears from now on."
1,Got different ones,"I didnt get this product, just regular gummy bears. NOt Techno ones. I am getting married a having a candy buffet and wanted thedifferent colors now does match!!!!!! Please send me new ones"
4,These Large Bears are Harder than the Gold Bears You May be Used To,"First, these bears are BIG - if you've ever bought Haribo's Gold Bears for a snack, you'll be surprised that these are twice as large. Second, perhaps because of their bulk, they're not as easy to chew as the Gold Bears. Given Haribo's excellent quality, I don't think it's because the Techno Bears were stale, it's just that they're large and they seem to be a bit more firm. The flavors are good, but they do not precisely duplicate those found in Gold Bears. In sum, these are NOT just a shiny version of the Gold Bears that most people are familiar with - they are a distinct product with unique attributes that you may or may not like. Worth a try!"
3,Not fresh like the store,"I had purchased these supposed gummy bears in the store and they were great. I figured since buying so many I would go for the bigger bag. Mistake. They are very rubbery, not fresh like the store. I also purchase the licorice wheels which I must say are excellent. We never know how long these items are in stock on a site like this. The licorice was a back order so I imagine they were made fresh."
3,It Ok,"It definitly covers all aspects.mostly trivial things that are comon sense.I had to buy it for work so, if it wasn't for that, i would not have purchased it.There are some good proctices and ideas in here. I have been training for over 12 years anyway."
4,Reviews for dummies,"Training for Dummies was an extremely helpful tool, regardless of the training you might be doing. The information reaches across the board and can even be helpful in an interview process."
5,Great Introduction to Training,"Elaine Biech has written a very readable book on training that covers both delivery and development. The American Society for Training and Development, THE professional organization for trainers endorsed the book (for good reason). I found the section on training evaluation a bit lacking. The section would be served well by a few real world examples. I would recommend this book for the new trainer and for the established trainer who has had no formal education in training."
4,Good Overview of Training..,"I guess that's what the intent of this book and it gives examples from an expert in Training. The articles from several experts in the field of training also supports the content and adds value.Recommended if you need an overview, although in some chapters goes into details. Yet, there are several other books that focus on preparation, presentation, evaluation etc. which might be more focused on these topics."
3,Not just for dummies,"The book is supposed to be for dummies. However, I find it equally good for training professionals. The book has been organized beautifully in a simple language and layout. The coverage range from definition of training to ROI measurement. It is a great reference for the beginners."
2,Not what I expected at all.,"I had seen a small 4x5 paperback entitled, Training for Dummies, which discussed ways to use a Smartboad in the classroom. WHat I received was a book that was more about teaching someone how to give inservices; therefore, this book is actually useless for me. If you need to know how to prepare for giving a seminar or inservice, then it is right up your alley."
5,My hat is off to you!,"As someone who's trained for over two decades and trained other trainers myself, I applaud Elaine for yet another wonderful piece of work. In an age where learning is so essential and when lifelong learning has become a global mantra, this book should be something that everyone who is connected with teaching should have on their shelf. Elaine knows her stuff and she once again takes the time to share what she knows with others. Bravo, Elaine. My hat is off to you!"
3,lovely shoe,this shoe is beautiful but not true to size- i wear a very standard 10 and could not even begin to sqeeeze my foot in it
5,"Interesting story, well written","Very well done indeed. I am impressed that an English professor could turn in such good work as an historian and cover the courtroom battles with the skill of an experienced lawyer. A well told story of an obscure, but very revealing, chapter in the period just before the Civil War.Minor criticisms: Too much is devoted to courtroom battles at the expense of describing daily slave life. As the author is a professor at a late 20th Century American university, he feels it necessary from time to time to wave his little red PC book in the air and shout slogans: Slavery was evil! Racism is not nice! Well, duh. None of this adds to the book and all of it detracts from the book.Still, this is a good read. Buy it; you won't be disappointed. (By the way, I have never read Toni Morrison's ""Beloved""; one doesn't need to in order to enjoy this book.)"
4,still going,"first off, purchasing this game is a waste of your time and money. microsoft cut support and servers for it a number of years ago. but they did make the code open source and it was picked up by a group that love the game, and they created a server system and meeting place, updated buggy code and added content. the new system has restrictive access but is free and well protected from people that only play to ruin the experience for others.[...] is all you need. everything you need to play a truly original and creative game, with mixture of real time strategy, where other players follow instructions and work together for the good of all, and a combat flight sim with truly inspiring player versus player."
5,INCREDIBLE!,"This game is incredible. There's strategy, action and teamwork. It may very well be the benchmark for online games in the future. It also doesn't require a lot of hardware to run. Very few bugs for an online game. I played on a team with 40 others against another 40 player team for four hours. We scouted, built bases, developed technology, ambushed, mined, destroyed bases (almost won), lost bases, launched massive attacks with massive ships, got ambushed and eventually staged a last stand against incredible odds. I'm addicted, just ask my wife. The government should step in and regulate this game. See you there, maybe..."
5,Beta Tester Review,"As a member of the beta 0 team, I have to take a sense of pride in what was accomplished. Allegiance if by far the best flight sim/strategy game/fighter out there.This is a game for intense gamers and newbies alike. But be forewarned, it is not easy. The graphics are awesome, and the game really flies on a faster computer and cable modem, having the ability to max out even the most hard core gamers system resources.The biggest thing to keep in mind before you make the leap into allegiance is this: Are you a team player? This game is not for rouges. A single person can, and often does, make or break a game. If you're ready for a detailed and in depth strategy action game, where the fate of the game can depend on how well you cover the fighter in front of you, where a careless assault on an enemy can devastate your team and cost you the game, then gear up, get ready and fly!"
5,This is an amazing game!,"I wish I had discovered this game a year ago when it first came out. Microsoft's marketing really dropped the ball on this one.This is probably one of the best games I've ever played. If you ever wanted to play Wing Commander or Descent: Freespace in a multiplayer environment where you have humans commanding the bases, capital ships, turrets, etc, this game is it. Allegiance successfully combines a space sim with RTS elements and the result is nothing short of spectacular.And as an added bonus, version 1.0 is completely stable. There are apparently no patches for this game... a pretty rare accomplishment these days."
2,Sounds good....,"We purchased the Roomba Discovery not too long ago...and it went back to the store not too long ago. This vacuum dies quickly (45 minutes) on carpet. It gets up most of the stuff though. When you put it on tile or hardwood, it will go longer, but it tends to throw little pieces of stuff around like the robot is playing baseball. It also hits our coffee table and end table so hard, that it moves them about an inch with each bump. When the battery was getting low, it worked its way over to the charging station, and had to make about 5-7 attempts before it actually made it onto the charger. Bottom line:When it cleans, it will get about 1 room done in a charge - then 3 hours to recharge. When you have 7 rooms you want to get done, that is a lot of wasted time fooling around with a robot. It spends half the day cleaning and charging, by the afternoon, just want the rest of the floors done, so you will end up getting out the trusty upright.[...]"
1,Great idea; Crappy product!,"I just threw 2 Roomba's in the garbage. The first one worked well for a few weeks and would not get going again, even with new batteries and a thorough cleaning. But the idea was good, so we bought another that lasted about a week. Great idea; crap product. Save your money."
1,Very bad experienece,"Just had a brand new Romba 560 from Robotshop. Did not work at all even for a second. Contacted to iRobot for service. The replacement failed to deliver 3 times. Then contacted RobotShop and asked for return. However, the Robotshop takes no any responsibility for their error or mistake. They set new policy against what they printed on back of invoice. asking the customer pay everything for their errors."
1,IRobot Discovary,I've purchased this unit 2 months ago and I still can't get this unit to work. They have sent me 1 new Irobot and now a new power cord and base. I would not recommend this unit to anyone. It does not WORK!!
4,Love it,"I had intended to make 5 stars but messed it up. ;(This is the best purchase that I have ever made. The iRobot Discovery cleans all of my floor surfaces and is especially quick on my hardwoods and kitchen floors. I did have a couple of small problems, once the ibot got stuck under my cabinet kick plate and another time I don't think I had it back together correctly so when I returned it was in two pieces. Fortunately in both cases I was able to get it back on task with no problem.I have had the ibot for several months now and so far so good. Since I dont have to do anything except carry it to other rooms and push go, my floors get more of a opportunity to get vacumed while I do other things. It is fantastic!"
5,iRobot Roomba,"This is a great product. It has saved me a ton of work. Completelycontrolled with a remote, my floors are cleaned quickly and veryefficiently at the touch of a button.(...)It is a wonderful luxury, though, and I am glad I bought it.The only problem I have had is obtaining the correct replacement filters for it.The ones offered on the amazon.com website by Wholesalers Clubare not the correct ones for the model purchased."
4,"Not perfect, but pretty good.","I just got a Roomba Discovery today, and so far, it's pretty cool. The only problem I've had so far is that the charging indicator is always flashing red. The battery does seem to charge, but the indicator says battery depleted.As far as cleaning goes, it does a much better job than my Hoover Windtunnel.It's also fun to watch it go, though it immediately heads for wherever you don't want it to! It will also approch the same peice of dirt than back away from it 4 or 5 times in a row.I'd definately reccomend one for anyone who hates to vacuum and just needs to maintain a clean floor."
1,Too short life span,"We liked our Roomba despite all the problems mentioned above, but it turned out to be just another gimicky toy when it died a year and 5 months after we received it as a gift (without an extended warranty). The iRobot helpful customer service people informed me that the charger, docking station and robot were defective but could be replaced for $150. Um, no thanks. Don't get one!"
1,very unreliable quality,This is my third new one (not counting the two replacements). They are typically last about 6 months. This one is about four months. All seem to have the same issue (probaby very common with Irobot because they know the problem right away). The last time I only ship back a small part. This time they want me to ship the whole thing back. Very costly to ship this back. Great idea but my not to replace every few months.
4,"I never did vacuum, till NOW","My wife is thrilled that she doesn't have to handle all the vacuum duties anymore. This product is great, does a nice job, goes under the beds where most vacuums can't go. What a chore it used to be, turning matresses and box springs over to get to the inch plus dust build up under the beds. I have been very pleased with the iRobot Roomba so far, great gift idea, and it really works with little/no effort."
5,"Roomba, the Godsend","Being the owner of 4 cats, this thing is the best ""since sliced bread"" I use mine everyother day and have no complaints. You do have to ""Get Used To It"" in that you must make sure there isn't anything for it to get cought up on. Just like using anyother conventional vacume cleaner, it can only do just so much. You can't go over lamp wires or rug tassels and it will not work on ""Shag"" (do they still exist?) rugs. Works on Hardwood/Tile/Carpet in a snap. Mine will do three rooms and then head home for a charge. Oh did I mention the 4 Cats. They don't even give it a second thought anymore, one won't even move until it (the Roomba) bumps into it. Love it and thinking about buying a second one for the upper floor"
2,Cute gadget...doesn't get the job done,"I was hoping for a break from vacuuming but this little guy didn't provide it. It's great for getting the surface dust and animal hair but doesn't have much more power than that.The dust bin compartment is too small and fills quickly. Once full, it seems to spread the dust around rather than suck it up. I have a fairly clean house with wood floors and it fills up when the battery is still half charged.Also, it gets stuck on some area rugs and electrical cords. I have to rescue it and reset it frequently.With that being said, I do use it in between real vacuumings. It does get SOME of the fur and dust so it's better than nothing.I can't wait to see what the future generation roombas are able to do. Hopefully the manufacturer will improve on it and it will really do the job. I don't think this model should have been sold to consumers as is."
2,hopless battery,"Initially very pleased with the iRobot Roomba, & recommended it to numerous relatives & friends, & many of them then purchased iRobots for themselves.Now I'm not recommending it anymore! Very poor battery life ! At $70 + s&h; it becomes an annual expense I can do without.Yes it works well when it is working, & even the very frequent cleaning of brushes don't put me off. However when the battery begins to lose life after only 6 months & will only push the iRobot around for 15 minutes before recharge is required, it is no longer a viable piece of equipment, even if you have given it a cute pet name ( its not what I would call it today ). It has become just another bit of clutter for the garage.Hey well, back to the old upright I guess, not so cute but much more efficient."
4,Roomba in-between,"I have 2 dogs: a greyhound rescue and a basset. They are house dogs. They go out and play in the Tundraic snow and then come in to potato on their couches. so, they shed. a lot. This little Roomba guy is great for turning on and then returning to my home office travails - and also gives the basset something to chase around and bark at - and I love it that Roomba returns himself to his recharge station before he gets all plumb tuckered out. The bad news is that the miniscule place where the hair and other debris he chews up (kinda like Pac-man vac, eh?) isn't very big and needs emptying midway through his routine. This Roomba cannot be my main machine - for that I gotta have the Dyson Animal - but it's a great way to tidy up a bit in between my manual attended vacuuming sessions./TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
5,Nice improvements on the old Roomba,"I loved my original Roomba. It was always fun to watch, and it definitely did its job. That being said, I dumped it in a heartbeat for the Discovery model. The only complaints I ever had with the original was that the bin was so small that I had to empty it after every use, and it was annoying to have to plug it back into its charger manually. Now those two problems have been fixed, plus the Discovery just works a lot better all around. Keep up the good work iRobot."
1,The Worst!,"The machine was absolutely filthy, the filter, brushes and container were all nasty. I returned it and did get my refund. Worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon."
1,Piece of Garbage,"This was one of the few household purchases that I was truly excited about. Unfortunately, its been a nightmare.The Rhoomba broke down after only a couple of weeks usage. I spent hours discussing this with their customer support, and they grudgingly agreed to send me a another one. The new one did not work at all.Period.When I called them back, I was advised that it was out of warranty!So hundreds of dollars for two weeks worth of cleaning.If this was an aberration, I would understand that statistically, some people just get lemons. However, I've talked to 2 other people with the same problem - and the same ""helpful"" IRobot attitude.I suggest you save your money."
3,iRobot Roomba 4210 Discovery Floorvac Robotic Vacuum,"Gave as a gift ... person appreciated, but had to return...said it didn't work well on wood floors."
1,Customer Support is HORRIBLE,"I have a Roomba, and it is now dead after 2 uses. I called customer support, and they claim it is my (the customer's) responsibility to mail back the defective unit, and foot the bill for it. Obviously, customer retention is not in their vocabulary. On an almost related note, the general customer support I rec'vd was poor. English skills were very poor of the woman I spoke to, and the entire process made me wish that I was having dental surgery instead of dealing with their customer support."
1,Trash,I had mine for 2 weeks then the charger quit. They sent me a new charger andthat lasted a few weeks then it quit. Gave up and just threw the thing out.Richard
5,I love the Roomba,"My home office used to get a vacuuming once every couple of weeks. Now it gets vacuumed 2-3 times a day with the Roomba. This little vacuum is fun to watch and gets under my desk and chairs, places where a standard vacuum won't go, and it is no effort at all. I pick up the remote and touch the ""clean"" button and it backs out of its docking station and goes to work. Noisy, but it operates mostly when I am out of the office. Then it docks itself and recharges its battery. Amazing."
2,not worth the time,"Not for people with hair or dogs. Dirt and hair gets everywhere inside the machine and there are a million small parts to clean routinely. It gets stuck on rugs. Since we've had it we had to replace the battery once and it looks like the we'll need to replace it again. We have a small place, about 1000sq ft with less than half of it carpet (not shag) and the rest tile and wood flooring. I would much rather sweep or use a standard vacuum than have to continuously deal with the noise, fuss, and unreliability of this product. Maybe the later models are better, but this product was supposed to save one time and I really don't feel like it does that."
2,Junk,"Works ok on wood floors or thin carpet, when it works at all. Had to do a software upgrade, but even after that it fails regularly. The Problem? It only works if kept meticulously clean! Rather than spending time vacuuming the floor, I spend time cleaning the vacuum cleaner. Now, in spite of blasting it out with air from an air compressor (you do have one don't you?), it runs for 5 minutes the circles helplessly. I suppose if I could figure out how to take it apart, I could clean it yet again, but it's going in the trash this time. Yet another worthless piece of junk from an American Manufacturer (meaning made-in-china)."
4,So Far So good,I just purchased the roomba and to this point I am satisfied. It did a great job of cleaning my very dirty floors. You still need to remove things off the floor but then you don't have to vacuum yourself after you move everything. It did miss some corners in some rooms? I do wish the battery lasted a little longer though.
4,Great Expectations,"We have a yellow Lab puppy who sheds like the dickens on the hardwood floors, and the Roomba helps us keep up with the flying fur. It works best when you move the furniture and limit it to one room alone, and clean the Roomba after each use, which means that it doesn't actually save you a ton of work over just sweeping yourself. But it does what it says it does, and it works best in the hallways where you don't have to clear the space. And the prodigious amounts of dust and fur and lint and stuff that come out of it when we clean it are the best testament to its effectiveness."
2,Roomba,"Have been using Roomba 4210 for six weeks now and am disappointed. Works well, but loud, on bare surfaces. We have a 3000+ feet of hardwood/tile in our home, but most rooms have an area rug. The rugs, even the ones with less than 1/2 inch of thickness give the vacum problems. Tassles have to be tucked under the rug, vacum gets stuck in sliding door recess, and it can not clean large rooms (ie., it runs out of battery in our two rooms that are over 550 square feet). We now have given the vacuum to our daughter who has two rooms w/ no area rugs."
4,iRobot Roomba 4210 Discovery,"This is my third Roomba. Two Discoveries and one Sage, and they all vacuum up at least 85% of loose dirt. There always seems to be loose dust, etc. that the air from the Vac blows in different directions that the Roomba doesn't catch. Still, it's better than me getting on my knees every day to hand dust the floors w/Swiffer cloths. A cleaning maintenance schedule is vital to the performance and life of the vacs. A monthly thorough cleaning, and a quick cleaning (of all parts) at least after every second to third use will keep them working efficiently."
5,We love our little robot,"We bought a Roomba Discovery at Thanksgiving and are very pleased with it. It forces my family to pick up all the toys and clutter so we can watch it do its thing. The children LOVE watching it!From reading the reviews, it is obvious that Roomba is more suited to some environments than others. We use Roomba in our carpeted main living areas (we have Scooba for the kitchen and baths) and our bedrooms. There are no area rugs. We have 2 indoor only cats. If your house is similar to ours, then I think you will be very happy.It does have to be cleaned after each use and I usually do a thorough cleaning about once a week. For all the time it saves me from having to haul out a vacuum, it's a small trade-off."
3,OK but could be better,Good for a quick pick up or if lifting/pushing a big vacuum is difficult. Could use heavier brushes to get edges and corners and maybe more suction.
2,Durability Problems,"I have had two ROOMBAs (A Discovery and Discovery SE) for about five months now. We have three German Shepherds, multiple cats and a large house. Our ROOMBAs are used twice daily on the MAX setting.Although they clean well I've had lots of problems keeping them functional with multiple cliff sensor and brush drive failures despite cleaning them, cleaning the brushes and blowing them out with air after each use. The folks at I Robot have been great about replacing them under warranty but the process is beginning to get tiresome. I can only conclude that long-term durability is, at best, questionable and that maintenance is far greater than that of a ""normal"" vacuum. The whole equation adds up to time saved having a robot vacuum = zero."
2,I would like it more if it were not broken.,"I would like it more if it were not broken. It's fun to watch it roam around the house and it really works, picks up dirt. But it only vacuums for 5 minutes and then I have to pick it up and carry it back to it's base for a recharge. Not what is advertised. iRobot has a toll free number for support. Do you have a few hours to wait for someone to answer the phone? Here's the fun part: While you spend a big part of the day on hold you get to hear over and over again ""We know your time is valuable. Someone will be with you momentarily."""
3,My dog likes it,"While my dog attacks the big vac, she adores Roomba. I took some time prior to vacuuming to get her accustom to this creeping robot. Got her use to it slowly and made sure to keep the excitement level down. Why I purchased: I'm a techie (not trekie) and have a dog with free range of house and backyard. I needed daily vacuuming for pet hair and dirt. Reason why I gave it a 3: It seems to clean around the edges fine but rarely makes it to the center/dirtiest part of the room. I sent IROBOT an email explaining my concern a week ago, no response yet. I IROBOT provides me a fix to it just cleaning around walls, I will update this post. I recommend this for daily cleaning floors to help reduce allergies & pet hair but seriously.... think of this a first/second generation of low cost robot vac. Certainly a great innovation but still has a ways to go."
4,what fun,"I bought this as a birthday present for my husband. All his computer ""geek"" buddies had them so he thought that he needed one as well. I checked out all the reviews I could find on all the different models. We have 2 cats and 2 dogs so I wanted to make sure that it would work well even if there was a lot of animal hair to pick up. I was pleasantly surprised. It works great. We even have numerous throw rugs and it can go right over them. You do have to clean out the brushes on occasion. But other than that we haven't had any problems."
2,Not good with dog hair and defective units,"I have had a total of 4 roombas over a period of about 3 years (Two of which malfunctioned and I sent back under warranty). The 3rd finally died so I ordered another new one. It has worked mechanically well for a few months now. I can tell you they are not good with dog hair and hair in general. I have 2 medium length hair dogs and 3 women in the house. The hair gets wraped around the wheels and is a pain to get out. I have found using a steak knife works best and it tries your patience. This has to be done every time before I use it or the hair becomes so bad it locks the wheels up at times. Quick release wheels for cleaning would be so much better. Other than the hair and sending 2 defective units back, it has worked decent on my lament floors. I think after this one dies, I'll go back to the broom and dust pan."
2,Egregiously bad warranty and customer service,"Aside from the fact the product failed to function right out of the box and aside from the fact it took two weeks for them to ship a replacement, what really burns me is their refusal to provide for return shipping costs or reimburse me the $19.68 it cost me to return their defective product. They offered me a filter pack, a $14 dollar value!, (which costs them about a buck). Whoopee. If you buy this product, buy it from a store that takes returns. It might be a good idea to test it right there to make sure it charges."
4,Very Good Purchase!,"I got the iRobot Roomba 4210 Discovery for my wife. We have been using it for a few weeks now. I am very impressed. It picks up just about everything. We have a Husky and it catches all her dog hair on carpets, rugs, and floors. The iRobot transitions from floor to carpet to rug okay. It has some difficulty at time, but usually tackles it successfully in the end so it could be better but it is satisfactory to us. The battery definitely last longer on floor versus carpet. I would guess we get 1.3 hours on carpet only, about 1.6 hours on carpet and floor, and probably 2 hours on just floor. The only recommendations that I would make for iRobot (the company) would be to beef up the battery as we have a large house. It would be nice to get 3 hours on carpet and floor. Regardless, I would recommend iRobot to anyone."
2,A Pain...,"to remove the hair/fur from the brushes, and then have to go and grab the regular vacuum cleaner to clean up the post roomba clean up mess..."
2,"New robot,not much sense.","This is my family's new cleaning robot, and we've used it 5 or 6 times,and it's not THAT high tech.I mean,all it does is go spin, chase my 2 year old sister,and BUMP,BUMP,BUMP.There is NO pattern, it crosses all of its paths,and re-cleans cleaned spots!Also,it doesnt even pick up dirt I can see!I see this piece of blue lint/woll and what does it do? DRIVE OVER IT!!! And last,it goes back to home base when I see giant pieces of dirt and its battery isnt depleted yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Bait and Switch,"I've had my Romba Discovery for about a year, and its worked pretty well. Now the battery is dead, and Irobot won't replace it. They say the batteries are on back order, but offer a discount for a trade in. It's been 2 months since I ordered the battery and Irobot can't tell me when I can get this replacement part, but they can offer a good deal on a new unit. THIS IS CLEARLY A BAIT AND SWITCH AS WELL AS A DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICE. THIS UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR MEANS I WILL NEVER DO BUSISNESS WITH THIS COMPANY AND I ADVISE EVERYONE TO AVOID I-ROBOT.DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT. DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT. DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT. DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT."
3,"Good product, but needs a lot of upgrade","I have been using it for a few months. I love it. But there are a few problems :1. The remote's range sucks big time. You have to point from very close at adjactly towards the roomba to get it work. It gives me a headache.2. The virtual walls. My roomba goes crazy whenever it nears a virtual wall. It starts spinning around on the same spot. It gets stuck, and it only happens when it goes close to the virtual walls. Sucks big time also.Other than those it's a breeze to me."
5,Cleans as well as a regular vacuum. Major time saver.,"Works as advertised--you push a button and your vacuuming's done. You've got to clear away wires and make sure it has a clear path, but still--pretty nifty."
1,"It's a mini-brush, not a vacuum cleaner","The idea is great, but the execution is poor. Most importantly: It doesn't vacuum. It doesn't even have a vacuum pump. Therefore, the description is misleading. It has a brush and that is a totally different apparatus.Secondly, such a small device can't hold a decent, powerful battery, let alone vacuum a room. I'd really like a good, small robot vacuum cleaner but a Roomba just doesn't nearly have enough power. A common vacuum cleaner is around 1000 Watt. A Roomba's batteries are what, 3 Ampere per hour? You do the math. Compared to a real vacuum cleaner, it's an intelligent toy."
5,Love this bot!,"We got a Roomba for Christmas and we love it. We don't have any notions that it will replace our standard vacuum cleaner, though. We have dogs, and so while we vacuum thoroughly every week with a powerful upright, the floor seems to quickly collect a film of grit and dog hair. This is especially noticeable on the hardwood floors. Roomba is absolutely perfect for these in-between days. It glides around finding every little drift of dog hair and dirt, wriggling between the legs of tables and chairs, under the edge of the kitchen cabinets. The fascination of watching it bump and hum about its duties wears off after a couple weeks, but we're still quite impressed with how well it works."
3,Shipping Information,This does not ship in a box other than the Roomba box that holds it together so beware if your getting this as a present for someone in your house. My surprise was ruined.
1,Irobot shoddy customer service!,I had the Roomba Discovery for only 3 months when it acts up. It start to go reverse spin and stops dead totally. Spent 2 hrs on calling tech support. Waited 2 weeks for an OSMO to rectify the problem but the OSMO when arrived failed. So I sent the OSMO back and took another 2 weeks before another OSMO arrived. Same story the OSMO failed again. Now they ask me to send in the Roomba for a warranty exchange. After a week I caled they said it will take another 2 weeks before I cn get the roomba replacement as they have to verify the return and get approval for the replacement to be sent. All in I anticipated 2 months to get my problem resolved. This is unacceptable. Think twice before you get an iRobot product. The after service socks!!!!!
2,Not ready for prime time,"Great technology packed into a tiny machine that buzzes around and cleans your floor. The problem is it didn't last long for me. I used it mainly to clean the bathroom floors and under furniture. It saw use about once a week for 6 months before it failed. The power light would turn red immediately after a long charge. A new battery didn't fix the problem. Anything could have failed.On the other hand, my 10-year old Panasonic floor vacuum (also bought at Amazon) is still going strong and cleans better."
2,Disappointed,"It did not pick up everything. It missed a few spots that it covered.In addition, it completley missed my living room which is open to the dining room and kitchen"
5,Roomba Review,"I love my Roomba! I especially like how the Roomba goes under my beds and sofa. I have 2 dogs so I clean the brushes, etc. after every use. I highly recommend the Roomba--especially if you, like me, are not related to Mrs. Clean."
2,"could be really good, but isn't","The edges of your room and furniture will be vacuumed as thoroughly as possible (but still not that great) the rest of your home is very hit or miss, and it isn't that powerful, and it is rare that it finds it's way back to the charging station. But it's ok if you need to vacuum a lot and don't always have the time."
1,Breaks down easily,"Owned my Roomba for 2 years. Nice to use at first, but it stopped working 3 times. Now it cannot be fixed. This means that it cost $100 a year to use, not including buying filters and a new battery.Calling customer service is a nightmare."
4,Surprised me,I was very sceptical of this cleaner but thought I would give it a try. I am pleasantly surprised at the amount of dirt it picks up. I clean it every time I use it and that is a very simple process. I did try to contact the manufacturer to ask some questions and was on hold so long I hung up. the only thing I want to find out is --will this product clean 3 or 4 rooms and then return to home base while I am out. I have not been able to get that done yet. It can't seem to find home if it is in another room than the one it is cleaning. I do spend alot of time watching it work!!!
2,Was good until it started acting confused,"My Roomba was AWESOME. I mean AWESOME for the 2 wks that it worked. But now it's developed some sort of confusion where it thinks it's falling off an edge for no reason whatsoever, and bumps itself around in an imaginary box (in different places in the rooms) sometimes to the point where it goes into its ""I'm caught on a rug"" error recovery. You can tell it's confused because it will be travelling smoothly (straight) and suddenly start ""bumping"" an imaginary wall. Then the error recovery kicks in, it goes into a reverse arc and tries to lift its butt into the air like I've seen it do when caught on my throw-rug.I'm going to return it and try again with a new unit. I really want this to work.But if it doesn't, it has to get the 2-star rating for lousy reliability.And YES I have tried many things like debugging and cleaning all the sensors."
1,Company disrespects customers,"My father order Roomba Sage on Oct 26. As of Dec 1 I still don't have a functioning machine. After I returned it I had to phone the company for them to know that the original was in their warehouse and to send a replacement. The replacement didn't work and on Nov 24 they were suppose to send a new battery. The order for the battery didn't get place until after I phoned a week later to see what was happening. I've had the machine over a month and it has not moved one inch. Lord knows if the thing works right, the company's incompentence has prevented me from getting an operational machine. If you buy one of these and it doesn't work, like mine, just send it back to the retailer and tell them that you don't want it. The irobot customer service is the worst I've ever encountered and you will want to avoid irobot's customer service at all costs."
2,Doesn't do the job,"Based on some of the stronger reviews I had high hopes for it. But it doesn't get the job done.The good: it finds its way around simple spaces reasonably well.The bad: It couldn't handle anything heavier than light dust. It ignored sand, dog hair got trapped on the brushes underneath, small bits of paper got pushed around but never picked up.It could get onto and off of only the thinnest of area rugs. Most of ours were too thick, it treated them as if they were walls. When it did hop onto one it'd leave a big blob of dog hair off the brushes on the edge of the rug.Complex spaces confused it; it would go round-and-round-and-round our kitchen, poke out and hit the wall opposite and go right back in and continue lapping the island.So...it's on its way back."
4,Perfect for quick cleanups; not great on carpet,"We've had our Roomba for 3 months now, and found it to bea huge time saver. Because it's light and quite easy to clean(takes 5 minutes tops, and our 4-year old loves to do it),we clean one room at a time. We switch it on when we leavefor work, then charge it over-night. So no ""cleaning Saturdays"".Problems:(1) The Roomba is a lot betteron our tile and hardwood floors than on our carpets.The rotating brushes snag up a lot of the carpet.This is not a problem for us because we plan toeventually replace our carpets with wood when the kidsare older, but it might be for you if you love yourcarpet.(2) Going back to the home base doesn't quite workin large rooms. It works in the smaller bed rooms wherethe unit is close enough to the home base, so it dieswherever.(3) The battery loses its charge quickly -- without use,it drains off in a couple of days. Make sure you are thetype to plan ahead (we charge it the night before we useit), or leave it always charging."
1,Horrible service.......,"I bought this item several months ago and initially had no problem with it. However, it recently failed to sense the basement stairs and fell to its death on the concete floor below. When I contacted the company they were not helpful at all. They said that it appeared to have malfunctioned but they were unwilling to replace it. All they wanted to do is sell me another one. If you are going to spend $300 on a vacuum, don't waste your money on this one, you'll be shelling out another $300 next year!"
2,Garbage Warranty!!! Good item when it works....,These are really great..........One problem!! They last about ONE YEAR...Exactly when the warranty is up!I used to love it until their customer service wouldn't give me the time of day! Buy an Oreck!~
5,I just love this thing!,"Ok, this is the first thing I've felt like reviewing. It looks like a gimmick, but it really works! We have a big black dog and two boys. We need a good vacuum. Even after we vacuum by hand the machine still picks up an amazing amount of stuff. My wife is a clean-freak, and the machine still finds hair and lint. A side benefit is that it is fun to watch. We root for it to get spots, and predict whether it can get out of binds (stick on a rug edge, under a chair, etc.). It usually wins, but not always.Drawbacks: It doesn't like fringe rugs, but still works around the fringe most of the time. And you have to clean out the rollers more often than a regular vac. But we get very clean floors and some entertainment value. After three months it still cleans very well, and is still fun to watch. There is a small yellow plastic part on the main roller that falls off sometimes when you clean it out. That's a pain. But we will never be without one of these silly things again."
3,"Good, but mine only lasted a year","I really love this thing. It it fantastic for hardwood floors, and it cuts down how often I need to vacuum carpets quite a bit. And it's great for getting under the bad and such.Problem is after a year or so it's useless. It stops and starts in fits, goes in circles, and the battery doesn't last very long. Unless you can afford to buy one every year, I would hesitate to purchase it.I'm afraid I like it so much I'm here to buy another. I hope they've made improvements since I bought mine."
3,works great....while it works.,"i am on my 3rd roomba and 2nd scooba. they work wonders for a few months (roomba is much better than scooba which doesn't have the brush so it can't do corners at all), but then the battery, brush, sensor, et cetera goes. my friend tried replacing all of the parts of her roombas, but it was less expensive to just get a new one when amazon runs it's $200 sales. like i said- they are both terrific and cut down on cleaning time tremendously, but if you are in it for the long run and don't plan to replace every 6 months or so...wait until they make some improvements."
1,"Great Idea, Bad execution","I received the Roomba as an engagement present. It was love at first sight. Upon leaving for work every day (for a week) I would tell it to vacuum my apartment before work and after work I would get home and all the daily accumulation of cat hair would be gathered in the bag less dirt basket and the roomba would be sitting on its charger fully charged ready to go again. All I would have to do was to empty the basket.As it ends up, the only thing holding the basket on is a rather flimsy plastic clip. After one week of regular use, the clip would no longer hold the basket to the roomba. It would drive away leaving its basket behind. A vacuum that doesn't hold dirt is just a noise maker. Unfortunately I have to return it as I feel no need to rig together a $270 appliance."
3,Useless on carpets,"It runs well either on tile or wood floors but it is useless on carpeted floors since it gets stuck all the time. If there's pet hair on the carpets (we have two dogs) the brushes will get entangled and the Roomba will stop. The Roomba also picks up carpet fibers and after a while the fibers wrap around the brushes and, again, the roomba will get stuck.I will wait two or three years and will buy an improved, more powerful Roomba. These ones we have today still leave too much to be desired.The idea of a vacuum that works all by itself is fantastic and I do hope we will one day be able to buy the very good Roomba so many of us are eagerly waiting for."
2,Roomba doesn't live here anymore,I loved this product-until it stopped working. It met my expectations until it stopped working after six months. Irobot replaced it with a new unit . That one lasted about two months. I followed all care instructions.This product is not reliable sad to say.The concept here is great but the reality is not.
1,Not Enough Poop,"I got the Discovery Roomba for tile floors with a lot of pet hair and discovered that it has storage for about a pinch of the stuff, where I needed it to pick up handfuls. The dustbin has room for perhaps a cup of dirt, and it would probably be good for picking up superficial dirt when used regularly. It certainly doesn't have the power for deep cleaning. The search strategy takes a lot of time and repeat sweeps to cover a given area, so it's not very efficient or ecological. I gave this product to a friend and returned to my handy dust mop, brush and dustpan to git-er-done."
4,I love the Roomba,I was leary of buying a Roomba but I have been watching them for a while. I read some negative reviews but decided to buy one anyway. I love it and it does everything it is supposed to do. It is easy to operate and it cleans beautifully. We have 90% tile floors and it cleans them very well along with the carpeted rooms. Just program it and let it go. It even goes under the couch. I liked it so much I bought one for my mother.
2,Not sure it is worth the hassle,"Only my extreme dislike of vacuuming makes me want to keep my Roomba Discovery. It does do an excellent job of cleaning floors. But so does my Miele vacuum. Unlike the Miele, however, the Roomba requires almost constant maintenance - removing and cleaning bearings, cleaning small wires behind drive wheels, cleaning sensors etc., which make me question its convenience.My second complaint is about the User's Manual. Or lack thereof. Considering how much specialized maintenance is required and the number of things that can go wrong I think the manufacturer should include a complete User's Manual with the product. Instead, almost all troubleshooting requires visiting the manufacturer's web site.Would I recommend the Roomba to friends? Maybe, but only with serious reservations. It costs a lot of money and in the end I am not convinced it saves me any time."
4,Roomba Cleans Rooms,"Very good product. Able to clean in the tightest of spaces. The only problem is with tall area rugs and/or fringe.. the roomba gets stuck. It works best if you move everything out of its way.When it has free clearance, it does a great job."
4,Ra Ra Roomba!,"Roomba has been a welcome addition to our family life. Fold fringes of rugs under and watch out for cables, and you have a winner. We have dark brown hardwood floors which I was worried about as I had read Roomba dislikes` dark floors but no problem at all. I don't like the tracks it leaves in the bedroom carpets but it cleans them efficiently even under the beds. If it gets caught up in a toy or cable it tends to dump itscontents on the floor but if you prep the room you,ll have no worries.All in all its a keeper!"
1,"Great idea, not ready for prime time","This is a great idea for a product, but it's not quite ready for serious work yet. The robot works great on hard floors, forget it for carpet (even short pile carpet), it just barely cleans it. And the battery. I've gone through THREE batteries already, they don't last long, even with proper use, just do a search on the internet about the Roomba battery problems. I should have waited a couple more years before buying one of these, hopefully by then they'll have the bugs worked out."
4,Very useful addition,"With two dogs and two cats, I really notice the days when I've forgotten to run the Roomba - there's grit and hair on my hardwood floors. So, it's very useful to run on a daily basis.On the negative side, it's noisy (so I usually set it to run when I'm going outside), it gets stuck on things (which forces you to pick up the floor before you run it), and it's messy to empty and clean the cup and rollers. I almost wish it had a bag that you could throw out, instead of a cup. The fine particles tend to fly around while emptying it, so I end up laying it on top of the garbage can while I empty it.Despite the negatives, it's a useful addition to the weekly vacuuming we do with a regular vacuum. Does exceptionally well on hard floors; less well on carpeting. All in all, I would buy this again."
5,Great,"Extremely happy with ""Roomba"". I have two dogs that shed and it's no longer a problem. My third ""pet"" roomba takes care of it every day. This appliance is great."
3,Not for pet hair,"What a great idea! It did well with the the basic ""stuff"" you'd track in with your feet, but not so well with the cat hair we bought it to pick up. It's going back to the store."
4,Great for regular cleaning,"The Roomba does a fairly good job in cleaning the floor (both carpet and hardwood). Although by observing it for few minutes, it seems to be missing few spots, it does eventually get to all the spots in a room if you let it completes its run. From time to time, I still need to do a deep vacuuming to get to all the tough/corner spots, which is o.k. The SPOT clean option is great if you spill stuff in a small area. However, the Roomba is very noisy, which is the reason why I did not give it 5-stars. For example, you won't be able to watch TV and have it running in the background at the same time. But, I just turn it on when I leave home, and the room is cleaned by the time I return. Overall, Roomba is a great purchase."
4,"A ""nice-to-have""","With 2 dogs and a cat, this vacuum does a GREAT job of helping out in between major house cleanings. However, the bin doesn't hold much, so it has to be emptied often. Also, when it goes from a hard floor to carpet or a rug, it sometimes gets hung up at the transition, and if the bin is near full, it will leave a large pile of dirt and hair at the transition. It does a great job of going back to its recharging cradle, so you can just empty it and start it again the next time. However, you'll still need the big vacuum on occassion. For those busy people that need a little help around the house, this product is great!"
1,"If you buy a Roomba, you'll be throwing your money away","I purchased a Roomba Discovery from Amazon about 18 months ago. At first I was delighted, but after about 6 months the unit stopped working and would only go around in sad little circles. (By the way, we are a retired couple, no pets, not a lot of heavy usage.) After several months of phone support failed to correct the problem, I shipped the machine back. Several more months went by before iRobot Corporation shipped me a cheaper machine that was already broken when it arrived. Patiently I shipped it back and after much pain and suffering received a replacement machine in March, 2006, which broke after only 5 months. iRobot contends that the 12 month warranty has expired. I contend that I've only had 11 months of use from this very expensive doorstop.Considering how poorly this machine has performed and how much difficulty I've had with customer support, I would strongly recommend against purchasing any of their products.Gail MordenReno, NV"
2,Cats killed the Roomba,"I have two cats and a large concrete floor only partially covered by a rug or two. This should be perfect for a Roomba. But the brushes kept getting clogged with cat hair. Yes, I followed directions and cleaned them. Then the main brush developed a short, and it ultimately stopped turning even after I cleaned it out. Then the battery would not hold a charge. They sent me a refurbished replacement. Same issues after just a couple of weeks. I love technology and I wish this thing would work as advertised, but it is simply not sufficiently durable or capable - yet. I'm hoping future generations of Roombas overcome these issues. As of now, it's just not ready."
4,"We love our ""Ruthie""!","This has become a part of our family and we have named her Ruthie. She is great at picking up the dog hair. It is a little noisy on hard floors, but much quieter on the carpets. I have even taken it to work to clean my office carpet, and it works wonderfully. It really does a great job and we are very happy with ours. In fact, one is being delivered to my son today as a house warming gift for him in his first home. I'm anxious to see how he enjoys his also."
4,"works great; use ""canned air"" to clean it","We got a roomba discovery about 6 months ago and it works very well on floors. Our house is entirely linoleum flooring(we rent) and very dusty. The little guy does a great job. It cleans for a couple hours, then finds it's base and recharges. In order for it to work well I do what the other reviewers recommend. I clean it before each time. It only takes a few minutes to empty it's bin, clean the brushes and blow out the filter. I use a can of ""canned air"" to blow out the filter and this works very well. I've never had to replace the filter. Cleaning it out takes much less time than vacuuming. Enjoy."
5,Impressive,"I was given this roomba as a gift, and quite frankly I thought it was kind of ridiculous to have a robot vacuum cleaner - until I actually watched it work. Now, I'm not saying that it's not ridiculous on some level to have a robot vaccum cleaner, it can't be called a necessity, but this little guy is really cool. It actively gets itself out of rough spots by using its different wheels - turning opposite directions, or more powerfully, to disengage itself if it has stayed in one position for more than a second or two. It does everything described in the product description and does it well.It moves across tile and rug and navigates a stair case consistently. It did fall down the stairs once, when its sensor was covered with dust/pet hair from having vacuumed for a while, so I'm more careful to make sure the sensor area is clean. The good news is that it still works great even after falling down the stairs. All in all, I have to highly recommend this vacuum."
2,Roomba Discovery - a Poor Investment,"I purchased a Roomba Discovery in July of 2004. Since then it's had major in-warranty overhauls twice due to various malfunctions. Of course the battery has been replaced, as well. In Feb., '07 Roomba died for good and I bought a new one. That one came with only a 60-day warranty, and now it runs for 2 seconds and quits. iRobot tells me I need a new Roomba, as well as another new battery. I won't make another purchase from iRobot. The product quality is poor, at best, and the customer service is even worse.Susan Gill"
4,Awesome for busy people,*perfect for newer/low to med pile carpet*nice lint/dust filter that reminds me of the dryer lint catcher*great for all your floors; not just carpet*gets in places thats hard to reach*doesnt fall down stairs*easily detanglable if it catches on something*you find your home cleaner more of the time; because you dont have to be there!
3,Not suitable for new carpets,"We just moved into a brand new home w/brand new carpeting and tried to use this. The new carpet sheds a lot and cloggs up the roomba. It's good on non carpeted surfaces especially in the kitchen to pick up the big dust bunnies and dirt. It is a bit difficult to clean the brushes. Also, the battery seems to be lasting less and less."
1,Supplier sucks,"Unit arrived in a condition that makes me believe it was never refurbished. Totally dirty, would not work even after charging. I spent an additional $100 to buy a new battery and brushes. Will never buy from this seller again."
3,Not if you have oriental rugs,"This is an amazing product and a preview of the future in which robots will be increasingly important in our lives. It cleans amazingly well, both on hard floors and especially on carpet.The only problem is that it can't cope with the tassels on oriental rugs (of which we have quite a few) - it chokes on them."
2,Neat gimmick but not useful,"I've lived with the roomba for a year now and even though I was initially impressed, my wife and I have come to the conclusion that it is not more useful than a quality vacuum cleaner. The rooma unfortunately does not return to the dock reliably, battery life is quite short on carpet, the unit gets stuck very easily and worst of all it is messy and annoying to clean. Cleaning is truly a nightmare. If you have carpeted areas that the roomba cleans, you will be constantly picking through every part of the bottom, removing clumps of fibers and hair from all over the roller brush, grate, wheels, all over. It really was harder to prepare our rooms by picking up every wire, piece of paper etc and then clean the roomba afterwards than it was to simply vacuum with a good vacuum cleaner."
3,Working out the issues,"I just got this model for a christmas gift and I was a little dissapointed. I have a maze-y kind of house and the roomba ended up just cleaning the most labyrinthin parts of the house (ie under the table navigating around all the table legs) I also put a few scraps on the floor and roomba detected them but then went right over them without picking them up.However, I have a fairly small apartment and the roomba made it into every room and then every nook and cranny in that room (places like behind the toilet) I was surprised that it made it everywhere. Also, when i went to empty the dust bin, it was completley full so it was doing something all that time.Like everyone else mentioned, you have to roomba-proof your house before even turning the thing on. I let it go the first time and it got stuck on all the bathroom rugs in every room so I know now that I have to get those up before I start it"
3,Robot cleaner ok for light cleaning,The docking and charging of the Roomba 4210 is not as simple or as reliable as advertised. It is difficult to clear a typical room to enable the vacum to successfully dock. Once the Roomba is charged it does a pretty good job of cleaning but you must move most of the cords or small items from the room to get the cleaner to keep moving over the entire floor. I am satisfied with it's cleaning ability but frusted in moving objects out of the way to get it to clean the whole floor.
3,"I love it, even though it's not perfect","If you're a pet owner, like I am, this could just be the product you've been dreaming of. You can get all the hair up off the floor every day, while you're doing something else! My carpets have never looked so good. BUT the brushes and dustbin require a lot of maintenance. You have to empty the dustbin after each and every use. Fur gets wrapped in the brushes too easily and it seems I'm forever taking them out and tending to them. And I get frustrated when it gets ""confused"" and has a hard time heading back to the base. Still, I'm glad I have it."
1,IRobot customer service is HORRIBLE!!!,"I received an irobot vaccum as a gift and was so excited. When it worked it was fantastic, worked well and cleaned well. Only two months after receiving this product it broke so I called irobot to get a replacement part. Two months later and still no part (it was on backorder apparently) I tried to get my $$$ back. I had called irobot several times during these two months with no help from them. So now it's too late to get my $$$ back from Amazon and irobot is no help. I asked them to extend my warranty, but no, they won't. It doesn't matter that my vaccum is only 4 months old and I've only used it two of those months. They still can't send me the part, they won't send me a replacement vaccum, they won't let me return the vaccum, so I have a relatively new vaccum that is just taking up space. Don't waste your money on such a fragile product because irobot won't be there to help you when it fails. And it will fail!"
2,"good idea, bad follow through",We have had two Roomba vaccuums and both quit working after a short time. While they were functioning they were reasonably efficient in spite of their small dust containers. They are virtually impossible to get serviced and the Roomba people so far have offered little help.
1,DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!,"I have had countless battery problems, and once the machine was out of warranty (16 months) it broke down.Look at this reply from CS:""We apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, at this time we do not have a program that allows customers to send robots in for maintenance or service. iRobot offers support by phone or email. We would be happy to assist you in troubleshooting any issue that your robot may have.""OK, iRobot, you officially lost my business forever."
2,Works fine for the first year,I really wanted to love our Roomba. We even named her Rosie after that famous cartoon robot of the 60's. In the end the battery didn't last long and she would only clean bare floors and wide open spaces. She got confused one day and the company sent us a software update. After that she was never the same. She got confused a lot and just sputtered around. I'm sad to see her go. I would not buy another Roomba even for half the price.
4,Roomba,The Roomba may not replace a standard vacuum but enables reducing the amount of time spent vacuuming. Let Roomba do its thing and once a week do a thorough vacuuming with a standard machine.
1,Short life,"I purchased a new Discovery unit about two years ago and a couple of months ago the battery would not charge. I purchased a new battery on line for $45 and still no charge. after much correspondence back and forth with IROBOT service support I was finally told that the unit could not be repaired and they offered to exchange for a replacement unit for $119 plus shipping, plus return of the defective unit (shipping at my expense). I would not purchase another unit and would not recomend this unit.iRobot Roomba 4220 Discovery SE Intelligent Floorvac Vacuuming Robot, Grey"
1,Very Disappointed,Over a period of about 6 months I purchased 4 Roombas - 2 Pro Elites and 2 Discovery SE. All of them eventually failed. The first one was wonderful. I loved it. It lasted about 2 months. Then it began to simply turn on its axis and beep. I talked to I-Robot and they said it would have to be sent in. Instead I returned it and got another one. That too did the same thing after about a week. I then exchanged that one for a Discovery SE which had just been released thinking that they had probably fixed the problem with a new design. That one didn't even work out of the box so I exchanged it for a new one. The 2nd Discovery SE lasted about a week and I finally returned it and decided to find another brand.When the Roombas worked they were wonderful but it was extremely frustrating when they stopped performing properly.
1,Refurbished Product is Garbage,"I cannot recommend purchase of the refurbished Roomba Discovery 4210. While I think the product did a good job on BARE floors (not carpet), now after only 4 months of light use (we only used in the kitchen/den area of our home), the unit is trashed. The refurb warranty is only 90 days and that's apparently all the machine is good for. I purchased a new APS fast charger in an attempt to rule that problem out, but it did nothing. This seems to be typical of this vacuum since the Roomba rep I talked to told me that if the charger failed the Roomba was ""probably trashed"". She was right. If you want to try this machine stick with the new one, at least you'll get a one year warranty. But I recommend staying away altogether."
3,Hire a maid instead or buy a top rated upright....,"I am not happy with this product because of the excessive noise, limited dust bin capacity, extensive time to clean brushes, tendency to get stuck, and general lack of overall cleaning ability. It takes hours to clean a room and has no actual vacuuming power, much like a commercial brush sweeper used to quick clean restaurant carpets between seatings. If you buy it just to see the robot technology you will be happy, but if you have two long-haired cats and a huge tiled living room like I do, it will not be effective."
1,"neat idea, pretty awful","Roomba was given as a gift to me. Not only is it noisy, but it took 2 hours to do my small house with 3 rooms closed off to it (about 1000 sq ft). It takes me 15 minutes to swiffer the house. It missed a LOT of areas. Yuck."
2,Works but support is a zero,"Works great, but does not last more than 12 months. Needed to pay for shipping to return iRobot due to charging problem. iRobot returned unit with new battery and charger, it worked for a month then the same problem of not recharging. Now in the trouble shooting mode that says to recharge it for 72 hours after the green light comes on. Almost bought the scooba today but deleted the order when I realized it would only work for six-12 months like the other iRobot probucts I have owned. Wished they worked better, becuase I like what they do."
2,not good with nooks and crannies....tempermental,"I got this for Hanukkah, but am likely returning it. Although I love the idea, it takes me more time to prepare the room for the Roomba than it would for me to clean it. I have to remove all cords that might be on the floor, because it always breaks when it runs over one. And any carpeting overtop hard wood has to be removed or it gets stuck. although I like that it goes under beds, which a regular vacuum cannot do, it gets stuck in places a normal vacuum doesn't, like on cords. I have a bureau that has a protruding wood piece in the center below the bureau, and the Roomba can get in, but not out, because it hits the wood piece half way in. I am now crawling on my hands and knees trying to pull it out and save the little guy. Like the others who have posted, I spend more time now vacuuming than before, which defeats the purpose of the product."
1,0-for-2,"This is an interesting toy, but hardly a tool that is ready for regular use in the home. The one I purchased as a Christmas present failed within three weeks. The replacment one failed in two. The manufacturer was of no help. Save your money."
1,what a piece of junk,"my wife wanted this unit to save time vacuuming. what a wast of money, piece of junk. Does not work as advertised."
1,Why Bother?,"You Know this thing is a Gimmick, and it cant possibly HOLD all the dirt in a rOOM! fOR THE $246.00 yOU wILL SPEND, WITH shipping etc.. You could have paid a Cleaning service to clean yor WHOLE HOUSE, bathrooms , kitchen and dUSTING AS WELL AS VACUUM! Dont waste Your Money- Call a service! Get A GOOD CLEANnot 1/3 of one!"
3,Do they have feelings?,"I love my Roomba, but I'm worried that is has feelings. After I saw A.I., I really began to ponder to what degree the machines of today already have independent thoughts and sensitivities. Does anyone know if Roombas know what it's like to hurt?Sometimes I feel like my Roomba has no soul, but other times I just want to love it, and feel like it keeps putting up a wall.Any info. will be helpful. Thanks!"
3,Newer models perform much better,"I bought this for my wife, along with a newer model from a local big box retailer. Frankly the newer models perform better. Better batter life, fewer hang-ups. This Roomba likes to hide under the bed rather than returning to his recharging station."
2,not worth the money,"I purchased the roomba, and have never been more UN-happy with a product than this. For the money not even close. Get ready to spend alot of time on the net reading how to fix it, as irobot does not stand behind their product."
1,it always dies,I have had 4 roomba's in 3 months. The longest one lasted was 10 hours. The last one died after 2 hours. I am taking it back and will get my money back.
1,I threw it away,Roomba worked for 6 months and I tried to get a response from the website without luck. When I finally got someone to respond they said that the software was bad and I had to buy a new one and they would give me a discount. Warranty sucks. Customer service treats you like an idiot. Buy an upright vacuum sweeper.$200 down the drain. They have no facility to fix ones that do not work. You have to throw it out and buy another.
2,Poor Quality. Breaks down too easily,"We purchsed our roomba through Sharper Image w/ replacement warrenty. For the past 2 years, we went through 3 roombas. First two just stop moving... our last one ended up just turning in circles. Although we can get a freereplacement, we stil have to pay $60 to buy a new warrenty after each replcement. This adds up to be costly (3 times is $180). Great idea but very poor quality control."
3,What a neat set of stemware!!,The only caution I would give a potential buy is do NOT over fill them. But they look so beautiful on the table and lend an air of elegance.
1,Customer service,"The total experience was unsatisfactory. It began when Laptop Components sent the wrong product even though the order couldn't even be placed without all of the model and type information. Amazon refused to intervene and insisted I go through the vendor.This was a laborious process, through a 3 party, and it took Laptop Components a week to even acknowledge it. I use my laptop in my home business and the correct device was obtained locally. The refund process took 26 days to resolve. From my point of view, if Amazon cannot do better with their vendors, ""Amazon is for books only"".J. Rogers"
4,Hastings AF 1285 Air Filter,I installed the AF 1285 Air Filter Element in my 2006 Honda Ridgeline a few weeks ago. The filter fit perfectly. As an AmazonPrime member I also enjoyed the free shipping.
5,Newby Enjoyed Yoga & Pilates !,"I am quite a bit over weight and very stressed out. I liked the idea of using the Yoga and Pilates together. A more seasoned exercise person may not find this that challenging, but I LOVED IT! I wish I had known before hand that I needed a stretchie cord. But it was wonderful!!! I especially enjoyed the relaxing meditation at the end. I felt really energized and truly relaxed after doing this!!!"
2,Too Slow,"I love Yoga and wanted to add Pilates, but this was just too slow. Like others I thought she talked too much. For someone who needs EXTREMELY detailed instruction, this would be a great video. For me, there was too much downtime for me to feel like I had any type of exercise."
2,slooooooooooow,"The moves done are fine, and explained well, but I think all this Louise Solomon does is talk. I prefer more movement and less talk on my exercise videos. I have several other videos that are not this slow."
4,wonderful,"Louise Solomon is an excellent instructor her voice is so relaxing.The work out on her first dvd is excellent.I have better posture,i feel great and just like she promised you will see results.I have been doing her first dvd consistently for three months and my body is leaner,flexible, and ive lost weight and body fat.Ive just begun the full body toner dvd.its challenging at first but its worth it. pilates is very calming and soothing with these dvds.I Love the dvds.I hope she comes out with a new edition soon."
3,A Beginner's Work-out,I think this is a good video for beginners. It's like watching a video in slow motion -- she goes through the poses at a very slow pace with way too much time passing before moving on to the next pose. I also didn't feel that the poses itself were challenging enough.
2,SnoooOOOOZ!,"Very, very BORING. I'm not exactly new to yoga, but I do know the basic principles, which she spends at least half the DVD talking about. The workout itself is more yoga and less pilates. Maybe good for someone who has never seen or heard of yoga or pilates before. No wonder it was only $2."
3,Too simple,"The yoga practice is really very, very simple. A beginner could use this video easily. However, if you have any yoga experience it is not very useful. Moves are very basic and very slow."
4,Great Workout!,"You think that perhaps you're not really getting much of a workout because you don't sweat a lot, but BOY OH BOY look out for those sore muscles later!!A wonderful workout for 5 in the morning before you shower and head for work!!"
3,Not for me,"I gave it three stars because the content itself is decent enough, but I did not enjoy it. She is careful to explain how to properly breathe and position yourself, and seems to have a nice positive attitude. But when it came to doing the actual workout, I wasn't enjoying it much. It is very mechanical."
1,Am I the only one who seriously hates this DVD?,"I wish I'd seen the review titled ""SNOOZE"" before I blew 2 bucks on this. The vast majority of reviews were filled with adoration, so it was a huge let down when I tried this DVD and found it insanely dull, slow, boring, and a terrible waste of time. If you are injured or ill, I imagine this is the workout for you but I fail to see how anyone who heavily exercises would benefit. Even as a light stretching DVD it fails for me and I'm no yoga-pro.I just wasted an hour of my life and I WANT THAT HOUR BACK so I can spend it on an effective workout.Sorry to be a downer, but I severely doubt any strength, flexibility, toning, or weightloss could be gained from this DVD. I really want that wasted hour back."
4,bissell very good,i used the bissell 3574 and for the price it is very good. it pick up well. and it is very good to clean. so i am gooding to pay one for my daughter.
1,Never again Bissell,"I have owned the 3575 model for about nine months. Saw the reviews, it fit my budget, thought it would be a good thing. Definitely not. It gets stuck on the places on the carpet that are a bit worn, suction is awful, the hose doesn't stretch like it says it should. At first it was ok, not the best, but as time has gone on, it has just gotten worse. And even though I clean the filters, empty the cup(that's easy, one good thing), check the belt, it still smells like something is burning. I used this machine to vacuum my rug, then used a friend's Oreck. I couldn't believe the amount of stuff I heard going through that machine, even though I had just vacuumed! So, this machine is headed for the thrift shop, along with the Big Green CLean Machine."
2,Cheap and useless,"I had this vacume for less then a year. in that time I found that it clogged easily, and on bare floors it really could not handle anything larger then sand.There was smell of burning rubber, and then the spinning brush no longer worked.As for the design, the power button is in a inconvenient place. i should have retuned this immediately. Oh well, never another Bissell."
1,Don't buy this poorly designed vacuum!!,"I have had this vacuum for about a year, and I just put it out with the trash. There are at least 3 areas that get clogged with dirrt and dust every time you use it. I have a straightened metal clothes hanger that I have to reach up into the hard-to-reach areas and dig out dirt clogs. I got so sick of doing this-because it still doesn't pick up well at all, that I decided to just trash it. Needless to say, I will not be buying another Bissell!!!"
1,It's like manually cleaning out the bag from a bag-type vacuum.,"I thought a bagless vacuum would be the answer I was looking for.The vacuum itself works wonderfully when fresh out of the box.However, every 2 months or so, you have to manually clean each of 3 filters and purchase a new HEPA filter (currently around $9) or the vacuum has zero suction.It's absolutely disgusting--like ripping open a bag from an old bag-type vacuum and manually scooping out all the dirt and dust. Filthy."
2,"Dirty, disgusting vacuum...",I have had this vacuum for 3 years now and it finally broke! YEA! I cannot wait to replace it with a Hoover.....I bought this b/c I was in a pinch. At first I loved the suction....but then I had to empty it! This vacuum is designed to get as much dirt & dust as possible back into the house as you just took out! We have 1 dog & 2200 sq ft and have to empty the vacuum at least 2x during one use. The dog hair and everything else gets trapped in the section above the removable container so you have to dig it out with your fingers. Absolutely disgusting!After 3 yrs it no longer has the same suction....the pet hair wand is rendered useless moments after using it...getting animal hair all wrapped up inside it. It does not edge clean at all so you have to use the attachments and they don't seem to have any suction either. This vacuum is poorly designed and awful....do not buy!
5,Good value,"I saw this model at a local thrift store, it looked good and I bought it. The rubber belt had snapped, I bought a new one online from totalvac dot com. They have a good inventory of vacuum supplies. It is now working great and I am happy with it.It is a little loud, but does a very good job of picking up dirt and stray threads on the carpeting. No problems and I am impressed with it. I would recommend buying a couple of extra belts and perhaps some extra filters. That would make it easy to swap out the foam filters and no need to wait for your filters to completely dry. There is some maintenance involved such as cleaning out your filters but nothing too difficult or time consuming. I would recommend this, or similiar models, as a relatively low-cost vacuum cleaner that does a good job."
1,This vacuum did not last ....,"I have had this vacuum for less than two years, and it just died on me. For awhile I was happy with it. But over the last month or so, the sound of it became louder and louder until it was almost unbearable. I couldn't figure out why. Then it ate two belts within a few weeks, and the motor finally died accompanied by smoke and a burning stench. I also had problems earlier with the height level adjuster for various thicknesses of carpet. The knob would turn, but the wheels on the bottom never moved up or down. (I saw this in another review, too.) I took it apart and managed to get it back into proper alignment once, but it too easily slipped out again. This vacuum certainly was short-lived."
1,Bissel Cleanview II Bagless is very cumbersome,"I am returning this item, it is so heavy and cumbersome. The power is good, 12 amps, but what good is it if you can't use it on your stairs or carry it to the second floor? The lever to make it stand upright is also very difficult to use. I have to force it into place with my foot, actually kicking it, but it comes out at the slightest touch and the vacuum falls over. It doesn't come with a stair cleaning tool, although they show a photo of a woman cleaning her stairs with it in the advertisement. I'm really disapointed in this item and in the advertising for it. Unless you are a body builder, I wouldn't reccomend this vacuum."
2,Attachment Hose Problem,"We have had our Bissell for just over a year and have recently become very disappointed with it. The attachment hose has very, very week sucking power. Dust flies out of the opening when using the attachment hose. Bottom line is that we can no longer use the attachment hose. The base vacuum works great, though."
3,Read the other reviews and see,"I have only used this vacuum 5 times. The dirt cup is very small and you have to empty it after each use. I didn't like the fact that you have to clean 3 filters after so many uses. It cleans great. I noticed a lot of dust/dirt getting stuck above the dirt holder. On the 5th use, there was a terrible smell. Most of the other reviews says the motor only lasts about a year, after 5 months it gets much louder and they can smell something burning. So I returned it after the 5th use. Went to an eureka."
2,"Looks good, can't tell which is better....",....my built-in mics or this Rode. I'm not impressed with this mic. It makes the videographer look like he's a pro though. Good thing there's audio software to increase the volume.
4,Good microphone,"Works well to pick up conversations, even in relatively noisy environments. Much better than the built in mike in my Canon Vixia camcorder.Must remeber: the power switch must be turned to the on position before it will record anything. I forgot for the first one or two clips of my initial sessions. A newbie mistake.The deadcat cover is fairly good, but I still ended up with some wind noise outdoors in mildly windy conditions."
4,Great audio. Flimsy mount.,"The audio capture is very nice. But the mount took a hard tap and broke off, requiring supergluing."
2,Bad right channel,"Right channel audio is 1/3 amplitude of the left! While trying to figure out what was wrong, the battery door popped loose and no longer closes completely. The slightest bump is enough to turn it off.How this got thru quality control is beyond me.From what I could tell of the left channel audio, the mic has good noise rejection from the back with decent sensitivity. Mount seems to do a good job isolating the mic from the camera noise.I've read numerous articles on the internet about people using this microphone so I believe it is a good one, I just got a bad one or someone grabbed a box from the wrong stack.Build quality looks good and the o-ring isolators seems to be close to standard sized ones that you can buy at automotive shops. Mounted right onto my Canon camera without any issues."
5,Environmental Audio,"I have used this microphone for the past year on Canon DSLR's in all sorts of conditions. Specifically, I have used it with Canon 7D and Canon 5D mkII cameras. Straight out of the box, add the 9V battery, mount (ZERO mount issues - make sure you unscrew the hold-down to make it fit your hot shoe), plug in to the microphone jack (NOT the AV jack!) and turn on the mic (green light tells you it is working).In quiet rooms, I have done interviews. I have mainly used this as a mic for a mix (adding in crowd noise - applause) to concert and live music jobs.I have mounted this on a Nikon D7000 and it worked fine (just played with a friend's camera).Final audio is WAY better than any onboard camera mic. The shock mount does a great job of isolating camera noises from the final audio."
5,Great microphone,Great microphone not exactly what I needed because I needed long range. The microphone is awesome as far as short distance.
5,Love these shoes,"These shoes are incredible. Comfortable and easy to wear. They are stylish and can go with many outfits. I could not believe how easy they are to walk in, even dance in. They are beautiful. They are strong and durable. I would highly recommend them!!"
4,Solid update of the original encyclopedia,I have to confess upfront. I have an entry in this encyclopedia. This is an update to the original full encyclopedia. Entries are authored by a pretty solid array of experts in public administration and public policy.Examples of entries (each running 4 to 6 pages long): Budget stabilization funds; Cooperative purchasing; Humanitarian intervention; John Rawls; Risk management; Urban planning and ethics.A useful addition to the original Encyclopedia. . . .
5,"A story of grief, but with hope","The book by Robert Romanyshyn is a poem on grief. The sudden death of his wife trowed the author in a depression that he manage to overcome in a poetic way. But it was not an easy task. It took months.When you are grieving, the normal reaction fromyour friends is to try to cheer you up. Unfortunately, this does not work. You have to live through your grief to the full, like Roberto did, and, as a result, awake stronger to continue your life.I recommend the book not only to the ones that are grieving, but to anyone that wants to understand what grief is, and prepare oneself to the vagaries of life.Roberto Lima Netto, author of The Jungian Bible."
4,RogersWorld,"Being a big Jethro Tull fan, this is one of their best albums, mainly because of the instrumental presentation. It's modern rock meets the Dark Ages with this album's mythical notes and creative lyrics. Great piece of work!"
1,the worst Tull album,"I am a Tull fan. I'd row a boat across the pond to see Tull but this is one of the weakest Tull albums. I saw the concert that promoted this album , it was thirty years ago. There is a lot of good and even great Tull music. The Christmas Album is one of the great Tull albums. But Broadsword isn't a great Tull album, in a word it sucks. Buy three copies of Songs From the Wood and give them to your friends but don't buy this one. The writing is sentimental and thirty years later it still sucks. Everyone writes something they wish they didn't, this is Tull's version of the album we wish we didn't make. Thankfully, there's lot of fantastic Tull music to make up for this ."
3,Not bad but not so good eighter !,"In the same category than Stormwatch, some good tracks like Beastie, Broadsword, and Flying Color. The rest is so-so, not a classic, far away from Thick as or Aqualung."
1,a BIT overrated ?!?!,"says a reviewer below. a BIT ?in the 10, 15, who remembers, years i had this album, i listened to it maybe 3 times. and i just skimmed thru it again, and realized: i hadn't missed a thing. this is one of the worst jethro tull albums ever. if you wanna buy it because you need to complete your tull catalog, go ahead, curb that economy. if you're new to tull, run the other way, there's plenty of good tull albums to be had.points to tull for trying to be contrmporary with this one, i.e. jump on the 80s bandwagon of ""listen mom, i got meself a synth"". but time has been unkind. listen to the sample of fallen on hard times, it tells the story."
1,18 songs! What a deal! (Not.),"I just came off listening to Aqualung, and let me warn you, this is no Aqualung. Although I was impressed by the number of tunes included on this CD, the quality of the songs is poor to average, and many of them sound highly similar to each other. I can't say that there is even a single good song on this CD. Some of the songs actually sound quite cheesy, with Casio-style keyboard effects in place of real instruments. There just is not very much of musical interest on this album. I'm disappointed, since Tull had vastly more potential than comes across on this CD. Too bad."
4,"Looks fantastic, makes perfect coffee, but ouch! That price.","Yes, it looks good. As a matter of fact, it's quite a work of art. But is it worth the money? I would have to say a definite maybe. I had a Bunn home brewer for many years, and although it was faster at making the coffee, the brew was not nearly as good as what the Dualit makes. The Bunn was fast, that's for sure, but it sacrificed quality for speed. The Dualit is faster than most, and the coffee really is excellent. I'm drinking it now while I write this, and I still confirm. And boy, does it look nice and shiny on my kitchen counter..."
2,Not worth the money,"I love coffee and I love my Dualit toaster, but the coffee maker is no better than a $30.00 Mr. Coffee machine. It doesn't keep the coffee hot( I have to use the microwave) and mine started spitting and sputtering and drawing air from inside and wouldn't fill the pot.The ""chrome"" sides are cheap plastic and it just doesn't have the fit and finish of the original toasters. This is another case of a company with a good product (toasters) trying to cash in on their reputation and make everything. Very dissipointed. If you want to impress your friends with your good taste in coffe makers, buy it. If you want good coffee and reliabilty, don't waste your money."
1,Cold Coffee,I bought this coffee maker and I regret it. This machine is heavy and awkward and the coffee is cold. Buyer Beware
4,Mini Track Ball Wore Out,"I just bought my 2nd one of these in the last 3 1/2 years. The X-axis rubber roller wore out, but the keyboard has always worked fine. The mini trackball needs constant cleaning due to lint/etc. buildup in the base, and occasionally had to 'tweezer' the rollers to pull off hairs. Just had to turn CCW the outer ring, pull out ball, and finger clean the base. Was somewhat of an inconveneince about 2x's/wk, but the advantages of L. thumb buttons/R. trackball made me sold on the concept. I'm also used to the key layout as compared to my laptop keyboard, since I have my laptop on a cart next to my recliner and put this keyboard on my lap while using. I use 8-10 hrs/day often (various forums/shopping/email/stc.) and am on the laptop every day. Got used to the layout & trackball...worth the $50 every 3-4 yrs.Gave it 4 stars because of the regular mini trackball cleaning reqd"
1,Squeaky trackball stutters,"Out of the box the trackball SQUEAKS, a day or two later it starts to stutter. Gets to a corner of the screen and gets stuck, taking many tries to get it out. This is going back to Amazon. The search for a decent mini keyboard with a smooth fast responsive trackball continues. Fentek puts out a mini keyboard w/trackball USB that I have used --3 keyboards in 3 years. They all manage to breakdown in the 13th month, just past the warranty period. That is the reason I was trying out the Adesso. I use the keyboard for serious typing as well as surfing and video editing. A mini with a trackball keeps me out of physical therapy. But most of the new ones are for multi media home theater use and not for serious computing. If anyone finds a good mini keyboard w/trackball, please post!"
2,track ball sucks,"The track ball gets dirty easily. Sometimes will not move up and down, no problem left to right. Had to buy the one with the mouse pad which works great.Adesso Mini Black USB Keyboard with Glidepoint Touchpad"
3,not all that useful,Dominica was a beautiful island but this guide was not all that helpful and some info. was outdated or incorrect.
3,Great photography and good guide,Good guide except that we couldn't find one of the snorkling sites described just by following their directions.
1,WORST MUSIC EVER,This is the absolute worst music I have ever listened to in my life! I thought I was downloading a best of the 80s CD and instead I got the worst headache I have ever gotten in my life. I have been told by many people I am the worst singer they have ever heard but I have a hard time believing even I hit as horrible of notes as these morons.
2,Item not as described,"I purchased this item because the description stated the songs were by various artists. Normally items described as ""various artists"" are by the original artists. In this case all the songs were performed by one band that I had never heard of. I intended to use it on my DJ gigs but would not dare. I was very disappointed in it."
1,Don't Buy. Not the original artists of these songs.,Don't Buy. Not the original artists of these songs. There needs to be some clearer indicator that this is not a various artist compilation and the album is made by someone hoping to cash in on accidental purchases.
4,Notes,"I used this map in my spring of 2009 trek in Langtang. I have a few notes for those planning to use this map to traverse terrain. First, I recommend that you laminate the map before going to Nepal, or at a minimum, the portion you plan on using. Second, is that the main route to Langtang (the village), as marked on this map, has since become the secondary route due to the opening of a new footbridge to the south (as you first start the trek), which opens-up the easier (and less scenic) route that takes you via Bamboo Lodge, picking up the single trail from Rimche to Langtang. Conversely, I recommend taking the route listed on the map instead of this new way, it offers better views of valley and is far less crowded. See more details of my route and trek information @[...]"
1,waste of money,did not work would not run....guess I could have wasted more time calling mnfct etc get work around for outdated software to be out on new computer but too much trouble
2,Disappointed!,"I was disappointed in how this book is. No color pictures. Not very thorough (simple) instructions. I tried a few of the ""recipes"" with little success. I will stick with some of the other kid friendly written cookbooks. Seemed like a good concept, but failed!"
2,"Mascot serial starring Rex the Horse and Rin Tin Tin, Jr.","Although Rex and Rin Tin Tin, Jr., are giving the star billing in this 1934 Poverty Row serial, former silent star Bob Custer turns in a creditable performance as a ranch owner whose beautiful stallion Rex is stolen by former ranch hands who intend to race him. Rin Tin Tin, Jr. and Bob track down the culprits and recover Rex. This was Custer's return to movies after a hiatus of several years."
2,"Wow, Stats Have Finally Jumped the Shark","I'm a geek and a stats-head.But, even I got bored with this book about the history of stats. It was informative, but a history of stats? Augh..."
4,I saw myself in this book,"This was a tough book for me to read It was a dry book I do love numbers, but Im not sure I love Books about numbers. Yet I got a lot out of this book Stats to value, and the history of Baseball stats.Its full of names, Most you wont remember But you see how even early on Owners of teams learned to value what the numbers predicted. And later it goes on to show how the numbers became important to Free Agency. You learn one of the first to value Stats was and the computer was Sandy Alderson Who later nurtured Billy BeaneAs a Kid I played some of the Games described in this book APba and one other. And I kept stats on those games Just like Bill james and some of the other stat freaks described in this bookSo I saw myself in this book to a point except I didnt carry on with it............ Sigh, it would have been a great lifes work Maybe thats why the book was hard to read"
5,Change the way you see the game,"After the ORIGINAL Bill James' Historical Baseball Abstract, this may be the best nuts & bolts baseball book I have ever read. A bit tedious in its detail for the casual fan, it will significantly affect those who grew up with baseball in the 60s and 70s. The evolution of statistics over that time helps to illustrate what Moneyball argued about ""hidden value"", and the near meaninglessness of many of the old measures. e.g. simple batting average: as Roger Angell once pointed out, the difference between a .270 hittter and a .300 hitter amounts to only about 1 hit per week over the full season. Read this and keep it on your baseball shelf."
4,Can't stop listening to this!,"This is a short but nonetheless solid pop/indie release. Whether or not you're a 764 hero fan, I think you'll enjoy this release. If the first couple of tracks throw you, go a little deeper into this album and I think you'll be pleasantly suprised. Not that you can go all that deep -- it's only about a half an hour long! But with a lot of bands releasing bloated, monotonous albums these days (I won't name any names), it's refreshing to hear something that ends at the right time and doesn't seem like the band should have stopped six tracks ago. And it's not that I don't like the first few tracks, it's just that they're perhaps a little less accessible. John Atkins kind of starts sounding like Wayne Coyne in parts and as much as I like the Lips, that can even annoy me sometimes. Bottom line: This is a good record."
5,A Marketplace of Words,This guy can write! This is not a book I would have read had I not previously read Crace. This is not a book about anything I particularly have an interest in. I enjoyed every page.His style makes it seem you are there as the events are taking place. This is not a book where you know every detail about each character. They are developed to move the story along. It's all about the feeling of the setting and the main character and a way of life.Crace continues to prove he can write unique books. His aren't formulaic or rehashes of his previous works. Highly recommended!
5,There's a lyricism to it.,I discovered myself to be involuntarily (and delightedly) reading the book aloud. Crace invents a world that is entirely real and self-contained. I was reminded of Tolkien.
3,Mixed feelings,"I have mixed feelings about Arcadia. On the one hand, it's an interesting story. On the other hand, the plot is burried in an excess of rambling descriptions. I think Arcaida would translate well to film or stage where the descriptions could be put to use."
2,"Superlative concept, inconsistently & poorly executed","Like the worst of the ""debunkers,"" Alschuler ignores that vast bulk of the ""observational data"" of the phenomena (eyewitness accounts & their consistencies) as he plays intellectual gymnastics with endless theorizing worthy of the worst of the recreationalist ""true believers."" Perhaps a better title would be ""What if we hand picked 8 % of the data and used it to convince ourselves of how scientifically educated and smart we are (AND LIBERAL for accepting that 8% of the data for the sake of argument), while ignoring the 92% of the data which might provide some answers."" The goal is clearly NOT to WORK on any answers, but to PLAY with concepts and the inadeuqate and incomplete scientific assumptions du jour (or du 20th Century). Try Hopkins _Sight_Unseen_ instead, which compatibly applies what is seen repeatedly to the latest theories of new physics and discoveries of science."
2,Worked for one night with one person...,"This airbed worked great the first night, but the second morning I woke up on the floor. I guess you get what you pay for, but if you want to use this for more than one night I would suggest a better one. Wouldn't really recommend it..."
5,Works like a champ!,"This was my first experience with an airbed that has a built-in pump, and I'm very happy with it. I didn't know until I read the instructions that the 'D' batteries mentioned in the online description had to be alkaline, so all I had on hand were heavy-duty; it didn't work at all with the heavy-duties (duh---I didn't know!) but worked like a champ when I used the alkalines. It fills, and deflates, in just a minute or two, faster than you'd think. I'd certainly buy again."
3,Does not stay firm,"The internal pump and not needing an outlet are nice, but the mattress does not stay firm enough overnight which is frustrating. It must be re-inflated often."
2,More like 2.5 stars,"Sacramento's Jackpot portrays failure as a beautiful thing with their third effort, F+. Sounding like a mix between Supergrass, My Morning Jacket and Wilco, Jackpot assembles a solid album of tunes to drink to when feeling down.F+ starts off strongly with vocalist Rusty Miller grittily telling a tale of sadness and late-night walking on ""Adventures Galore"" and hits its high point with ""Headlights,"" a five-minute rocker with twang.Towards the middle of the album, however, F+ loses steam. Songs like ""Euphoria"" and ""Dizzy"" are lackluster, downhearted tales that are easily tuned out.F+ finishes with the seven-minute ""Charlie Watts is God,"" a Lennon-esque tribute to rock brightening up one's obsolete life.While not quite alt-country, fans of Uncle Tupelo and Kings of Leon may find Jackpot worthwhile. Overall, F+ receives a B-, nothing earth shattering, but worth a listen."
4,Funny Guys,I saw these guys in concert with pepper and slightly stoopid. At first you're like are these guys for real. They actually have some catchy guitar riffs. The guitar player is a trip to watch play.
4,The Water of Life,Explore the greatest and the most exclusive vineyards in the world from South Africa and New Zealand to the Napa Valley of California and the Bordeaux region of France.
5,awesome adventure novel!,"I'm usually a scifi nut, but enjoy time travel if it's well thought out. This book was better than most I have read, even better than Crichton's timeline, because the reader gets to spend most of his time in some fabulous history! The story lines are cool, the characters are people you know, and the ending makes you really want more! Great book"
2,English class,"Good time travel books can be engrossing and plausible. Lost Child has many intriguing elements - Stonehenge, medieval history, a magical ring. Its foundations are great, but the rest - plot, characters, dialogue - fails to build upon them. The back of the book quotes White's English teacher, who called her ""Queen of the run-on sentence."" White seems to have conquered that little problem, but could use more time in English class. Lost Child reads like a high school short story. It's distracting to keep being told what we're supposed to be thinking (eg, ""only one person could do that - Adam."") Reading a good book is like watching a movie in your head. It's a pity, but it's just too hard to keep your mind on the action in Lost Child."
2,"""Lost"" the Plot","Good premise in which a son finds a message from his mother, who disappeared a few years earlier -- but a scientific examination proves the note is centuries old. A ring accompanies the message, and with it he's able to use Stonehenge as a portal and travel back to medieval times. But 80 percent of it winds up being a Harlequin romance about this sassy, spirited girl he meets up with, and the hunka-hunka gentleman pirate of a half-brother he turns out to have. In need of serious rewrites and editing to tighten the pace and focus."
5,An Excellent Textbook,Gilbert Strang's introductory book on Linear Algebra is superb. It provides an intuitive feel for the subject. The book covers the basics and the most important applications of linear algebra. Strang has a feel for what the student ought to learn from each chapter. I would recommend this book to the serious student of mathematics as well as to the engineering or science student.
2,I can't believe this is supposed to be a classic!,"I had this book for an undergraduate class in Linear Algebra. The author writes in a way that is supposed to seem as if he were talking to you. This is very annoying at times and more importantly doesn't make the book any clearer. The author will go off on tangents and he never stresses the important points. This makes the book hard to read. Eventhough the book contains most of the necessary undergraduate material in Linear Algebra, you will have to read it several times to get everything out of it. I rate the book with two stars because the material displayed is accurate, but very hard to find through all the authors blabbering."
2,"""Introduction"" to Linear Algebra ???","UPs:-Covers and emphasizes all matrix decompositions (plus includes a nice matrix decomposition list at the back)-Topics like linear transformations and changes of basis are explained in very different (and amazing indeed) waysDOWNs:-The author definitely lacks the ability to explain things in a logically ordered way. This is more obvious in his other books, especially the one about wavelets....-Beatiful examples are slaughtered by unneccessary and complex comments.CONCLUSIONs:-DEFINITELY NOT AN INTRODUCTIVE BOOK.-Recommended only after taking an ""introductive"" course in linear algebra with a text book like Meyer's."
3,basically a good math book,"I give this book 3 stars mostly because of Strang's style of writing and not so much for the information contained in the book. The lucid prose and the overabundance of exclamation points in the text (you'll see what I mean if you buy it) make this book read as if you were talking to a really cool math professor who knows what he is talking about and is excited (oh yeah) about linear algebra. That part of the book is great, but this book definitely does not cut it as a reference book. When I took linear algebra years ago, I thought the book had lots of really cool things in it, but now, when I need to look up some advanced linear algebra topic for another advanced math class, I simply cannot find anything useful in this book. If you are considering buying this book to supplement your library, be warned that it is a very basic treatment. Also, this book places less emphasis on applications and computations, so non-math majors may not find it very helpful."
4,"Music good, video quality, not so much","I like Styx so I enjoyed the videos, with the exception of Mr. Roboto. I was a fan earlier on and with many other fans, Mr. Roboto just wasn't my cup of tea. The group was doing something that just wasn't them, and sales of that album reflected that. Many of these videos were before the pre-MTV era, so the quality is probably comparable to many from that era. If I had to do it again, I would make the purchase."
2,Some nice photos but superficial content,"I was greatly disappointed by the lack of specifics included in this book. Many of the photos are provided as examples of popular mid-century styles and influences but do not include the designers who created them. If you're looking for decorating ideas, this book may provide inspiration. But for anyone already interested in mid-century modern design, this book comes up a bit short. It might teach you how to talk about mid-century design elements, but it doesn't go any deeper than how cool design from this period looks. I bought this book as I have a few mid-century modern pieces and I thought it would be nice to have a reference and examples from various mid-century designers... but it did not deliver."
3,Light on advice.,"Text was light on advice to recreate this look, unless you want to actually go out and buy original pieces. Which I'm sure would be nice, but if you want to spice up your average home with some mid-century joy, this book didn't help much."
4,Magic versus Ritual,"In an environment where `what we do is religion and what they do is magic' attitude, these compilers prefer to speak of `ritual' as a less value-ridden word and since the spells relate to that sphere of life we call `religion' the sub-title may be a more appropriate description. There are 135, dating from the first 1000 years of Christianity, in English, with notes and written originally on papyrus, parchment, rag paper, pottery or bone. There are love spells, healing spells, sexual spells, protective spells, spells to drive out demons, spells for a good singing voice or to silence a dog, and curses. A book for specialists."
4,More than sufficient,In dept discussion and examples provided. Great historical support and reasoning. Strong reference source for the topic than others I've seen
3,not what i expected,"it was ok, but i am not very sure on how to cast the spells. it has a good, but confusing, background. the spells are good, but I am not sure if all i say is the words given or if there is something i should knwo, not given in the book. i expected different."
5,Essential book for understanding colonial history,"A Colonial Complex provides a very interesting look at an often forgotten war in colonial America. The Yamasee War fought by the Indians that would become known as the creeks was a devastating conflict for both sides. It shaped the colonial mindset with regards to the Creeks and developed the role of the Cherokee for the future of colonial relations. It sets the stage for the development of Georgia as a colony and continues the erosion of Indian sovereignty by adding more boundaries to the creek nation. There are very few books that analyze the creek and almost none that take into account the Yamasee war. If you are interested in colonial affairs this is a must read. It is well written, concise and straight to the point."
5,The best cult movie ever made,"Well ok, perhaps ""best"" is a bit much, but certainly one of the coolest. What makes this DVD so special is the TV trailers and movie ads for the film, including one from Portigue (spelling)? The trailers, 8 minutes of them, make this a must have for any fan of wierd movies. Sadly the picture is not letterbox and the sound is not what it could be, but hey, what are you going to do? For my full review of this film go to the Monkees section and look up the soundtrack for this fine film.""Lost Johnny"""
5,Phantasmogoric Splendor,"The Monkees did an excellent job of uncovering the truth behind their own story, although it ruined them. The movie seems like a psychedelic trip, but in all actuality it is the story of the sixties, you just have to know what you are looking for. Jumping scenes, wonderful music, and the four best actors/musicians in the buisness have to make one of my favorite movies. World Peace, Free Love, Spiritual Understanding, ~Meags"
4,"Whew, and wow","Overlooked by all the other reviewers so far are the very brief but powerful moments of savage anger at the Vietnam War, then accelerating rapidly toward the height of its unpopularity with the young. The atrocities depicted last all of thirty seconds I suppose but they are a real poke in the eye, contributing to the overall atmosphere of heavy cynicism that dominates this film and equating the Monkees' anger at being chewed by the music industry with the injustices of American war policy. The counterculture wasn't all just fun and games -- they were definitely angry about American culture in many respects. Head's social relevance has faded, but no one can get away with denying that it's a valuable historical artifact at the very least. Genuine art, with a unsettling political subtext. They sure don't make 'em like this any more."
2,Wow,"So bad it's not even ""so bad it's good"" nearly unwatchable. Got two stars for the Zappa scene. My favorite Monkey was always the car, and unless I missed it the car was left out."
5,More Monkees,Seller provides quality product at a reasonable price. Movie was well-packaged and arrived promptly. I highly recommend this seller and this product.This was a purchase by my 14-year-old daughter; and I'm so happy we have yet another thing in common: love of the Monkees and music and this odd/awesome movie!
5,A must for all Monkee fans,"Monkees cult classic...The more you watch it, the more you 'get it' this meaning what the group was trying to convey to their fans."
4,Frobis,"Precisely not the kind of movie anybody would have expected the Monkees to make, this film (co-written by Jack Nicholson, and featuring Frank Zappa and Victor Mature, in the same film, together!) was either a calculated go at making the Monkees counterculturally acceptable, or just an inspired set of non-linear, 'Python'-esque sketches on the subject of manufactured fame. Released at the same time as the Beatles' 'Help', this is closer in tone to the unstructured 'Magical Mystery Tour', but whereas the latter Beatles movie was curiously joyless and forced, 'Head' is actually pretty funny, in both senses of the word. Attempting to describe it is pointless - it opens with a Monkee leaping from a bridge, and ecompasses war, a Coke machine in the desert, and a giant eye in a medicine cabinet. Think of it as a set of short bits of the television show, edited by a man with no idea of structure, only weirder. And you're half-way there. It's a shame it isn't out on DVD."
3,"""And it looks like we made it once again!""","""Here they come, walkin down the street. They get the funniest looks from, all the critics they meet!"" HEAD. Original promotion for this movie was a poster of just a guys head, and at the bottom said ""Coming to a theatre Near you"", with no mention of The Monkees. This is a DIE-HARD Monkees fan movie, or if you are intrigued about them. In this movie Bob Rafelson and Bert Shnider(the creators of the monkees) wanted to kill them off. This typically wasn't a monkees episode when you have one of the monkees commiting suicide in the first minute of the film. Well if your a monkees fan you will class this as a break through monkees film..."
4,"head,if u can find it","what a blast from the past-complete w/zappa.saw this at movies in sixties,confusing does not adequately describe-disney boys doing a movie about-uh,well what WAS it about anyway lush scenery,cameos from everybody, shame the score didn't sell{didn't make sense w/o the movie}.I LIKE IT-the Dean"
2,WARNING! Not For Kids!,"There is a scene of a man being executed by pistol (yes for real). How this film got a ""G"" rating in inconprehensable. Shame on the producers for not updating the rating to at least ""PG""."
2,Not the Monkees I knew,The foursome got in trouble doing this movie. The slapstick group wasn't that funny in this film. Guns don't belong in a Monkee's movie.
1,The Monkees Mystery Tour.,"And not unlike their British counterparts pitiful venture the prior year in a confusing and painfully fossilized piece of Tv cinema the Monkees should have learnt when a movie is a ""Trip"" and when its something that you trip over.The Monkees were great fun as a TV show and their music was different and their determination to prove themselves by rehearsing and actually going out on tour to show they were more then a concocted garage band showed dedication and that they were not a One Hit Album Wonder. But sadly this movie like Mystery Tour has no purpose other then to portray some real talent going through some senseless paces in a boring and outdated film."
1,Not like the TV show,"If you have seen this movie before, then get it. If not, it is a really really different kind of movie. So much different then anything the Monkees have done before. Different then most people have done before."
1,New curse words.,"The monkees invented a couple of new curse words because of this movie.Imagine living in 1968, and while driving in your car and after listening to the Doors on your car radio, you hear an ad with a man and woman moaning: ""Head... Coming... Soon... Coming... Head... Head... Coming...""Two of those words caught on for the wrong reasons.The movie itself bombed because Monkee fans were not into drug flicks, and psychedelic drug users were not into the Monkees. But as we now know those dirty sayings never died.Lesson learned: Don't do drugs and watch your mouth!"
3,The film is 5 star.,Great film about corporate control and trying to have independent fun despite it all. A greater fantasy symbol now than then as the once unique one of a kind Route 66 places and ways of doing things in America have been replaced by ubiquitous chains such as Mc.Donalds that fill product with corn syrup so we acqure a taste that gives us chronic diabetes when before that taste was terrbile to us. Also this is a great rip on the Monkees by the Monkees. Davey's knock on himself as the ulitmate heartthrob of the 60s and the #1 tambourine player of all times (sorry Betty and Veronica) is very funny. One of the most creative films ever that is better when you understand it. Albeit it is a little goofy nerdy too and that can kill it for some but then that's 60's Bubblegum for you.
3,My review of Head,"Okay, let's start by saying this movie is NOT the movie The Monkees shold have made. They wanted to get away from their 'manufactured image' but this movie was not the way to go. Granted there are some funny parts, The cop washes his hands closes the medicine cabinet see Victor Mature and faints. (Don't ask me why, it maybe the look on his face.) I had ""Head"" on VHS and wanted it on DVD to go with my Seasons 1 and 2 of the series. Unless you're high or drunk this movie will make no sense whatever."
3,The Monkees were pretty good.,"Yes, they were good. This movie shows the Monkees not like on the tv series, but much better. This is a very psychodelic movie in which you really feel you are on a trip, a very colorful one. It's obvious that in this kind of movie you cannot demand a whole understandable story, however you can follow what is happening. The sountrack is very cool too. There is specially one song, ""The porpoise song"", which is very nice, I even imagined The Beatles singing that song. If you wanna feel the way the psychodelic era was, this is a movie you should see. It is really a trip. All aboard."
3,"micky dolenze ""Head""","I brought this video for my daughter's b'day. She has special needs and is a great fan of the monkeeswe were very dissapionted when we came to view the video, only to find it dosent work on any of our video players.I then find out that some video's brought from the USA do not work in this country. I feel that a warning of some kind could be used so that people do not make the same mistake as me. as for the video contents, I dont know I couldnt play it!!!!!."
4,A Head trip,"I must say that Head was everything I expected yet full of things I didn't expect. I enjoyed it very very much, thought felt a little disapoitned becasue I had managed to see almost the whole thing without ever getting to watch the movie itself.If you watched the Behind The Scenes on Vh1 when it featured the monkees, they showed TONS of clips from the movie and if you read a lot about the movie (like i did) nothing seems new on it.Despite this, I did enjoy it very much and would watch it every day if I could. (but I can't. The family won't let me. :-) *sigh*)I definalty recomend it to fans of The Monkees and anyone who enjoys *diffrent* kinds of movies."
5,Definately NOT the show...but great,"I understand part of the reason that ""Head"" didn't do well in theaters. Many of their fans were young girls (as I am) and couldn't accept anything different from the Monkees. Never change is a good thing for someone whose world is turning upside down. On the other hand, ""Head"" is the best movie I've ever seen. A lot of people don't understand it (I, personally, wonder whether that was half the point of the film), and I don't pretend to understand it. But if you've got an open mind and don't mind people you think of as just pretty faces acting differently from what you've seen, then it's worth your money."
4,The Monkees' Cinematic Odyssey,"Micky, Davy, Mike and Peter's 1968 cult film is not anything like the television show. The Monkees destroy their burdensome ""manufactured pop"" image in a wild series of satirical and psychedelic vignettes co-written by Jack Nicholson and directed by Bob Rafelson. ""Head"" has no plot, but does have Victor Mature, Annette Funicello, Sonny Liston and Frank Zappa. A surprisingly good soundtrack includes the classic ""Porpoise Song"" (written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King), Tork's ""Do I Have to Do This All Over Again"" and Nesmith's ""Circle Sky."" Though the initial failure of ""Head"" hastened the Monkees' demise, it has been reassessed in some critical circles as a minor masterpiece. In 1990, the movie was showcased at London's National Film Theatre as part of its ""Rock on Film"" retrospective - a well-deserved honor."
3,Full-length series of vignettes fine fodder for the prefabs,"Once their successful TV series ended, and they began to write their own albums, the Monkees birthed this trippy, psychedelic version of their show; the movie is filled with bizarre skits, set-ups, and flashbacks which are woven into a spare, linear plot. Watch this movie for its historical value -- Jack Nicholson as screenwriter and cameo actor. For its really cool ""Porpoise Song"". For its ""in"" jokes and hippie appeal. Watch it right before (or right after) the MagicalMystery Tour and the Rock & Roll Circus."
4,LET ME GUESS....THE WRITERS WERE ON ACID???,"THIS PSYCHODELIC FLICK HAD ME DIZZY BY THE END. ITS WORTH WATCHING IF YOURE A MONKEES FAN BUT BE PREPARED TO GET LOST BECAUSE THERE IS NO PLOT. THE ENTIRE MOVIE IS COMPLETELY SENSELESS AND LACKS THE TYPICAL ""MONKEE HUMOR"". OVERALL I LIKED IT AND WILL PROBABLY WATCH IT AGAIN."
4,Antithesis of the TV Show,"I saw this film for the first time when AMC had a rockin' movie marathon that also included the Woodstock movie and the Who's Tommy (both great films) but I'm supposed to talk about Head. There's no cohesive plot, but after you watch it a couple times it sorta comes together (and no i didn't smoke up at all at any point before, during or after the movie): It's almost like the movie moves backwards and culminates with the opening scene-whoops, i guess i gave it away. But anyway, the funny moments and guest spots (including a quick cameo by Jack Nicholson), as well as the music, balance out with the wierder moments. Definitely worth checking out."
5,Above All Heads,"This movie shows all the rises and falls of the Monkees careers. They definitely showed their ""last horras"". It was full of action, adventure, and fun! The Monkees really show their talent and humor in this movie/DVD ""Head"". I recommend you and anyone else to see it!"
4,NOT FOR THE LIGHT HEARTED MONKEE LOVER,The first time I wathced the Monkees movie; HEAD it was all a bit overwhelming. It is definately not for the light hearted Monkees lover. It shows a deeper introspective side of the Monkees and needs to be really concentrated on to be able to get all of the messages trying to be portrayed in the film.
4,Monkees Head,"... Okay, i own this movie and it rocks!! It is extremely confusing the 1st time ya see it, but after seein it a few times it kinda begins to make sense. Its got some good music in it too, i love the porpoise song, which was written by Carole King. It is actually VERY funny, and u notice something new everytime you watch it! its a very fun movie to watch, especially if youre in the mood for some phsycadelicness. If your a Monkees fan, i think you'll like it, no love it... but hey guys, Head is still awesome!!! You should definitaly buy it, and get Magical Mystery Tour with The Beatles while your at it!!"
1,This video is too weird,I have only watched this video only once and that was enough for me. It was almost like you have to be on a acid to understand this movie.
2,Don't give me head,"What in the....ever wondered what an lsd trip feels like? Watch thismovie and you will know. So, what is this movie about? Absolutleynothing! The beginning is mostly non-sense that jumps from one sceneto the next. Towards the end there starts to be a little more story. Like you will know why that dude jumps off the bridge in the beginning.But, I was excited to catch Frank Zappa and a cow for a few seconds.Also, jack nicholson appears for a brief moment. He helped write this movie. LSD had to be the biggest influence in writing this movie. Because that's what it feels like for 80+ minutes. There are some interesting musical numbers. It's just so weird. If you ever watched this movieduring a trip, you'd probably trip ten times harder than normal."
3,"Good tools, cheap case","The screwdrivers are ok, but the case is pretty cheap. I have had to replace the hinges with tape and use tape also for a catch."
5,The Revolution of hip hop,"I was filled with joy after watch the wholistic wellness video. Supa Nova Slom made an approach that no other have ever did. He took wholistic wellness to the streets where it is needed, cause our youths are the future of today and our people are dying from health problems. He approached it in a way that the children of the streets and even gangsters would understand and be able to relate to. Like when he had the Thugs drinking 40's and fliped to drinking a chlorophyll drink was off da hook, for our brothers in streets need to stop drinking liquor that kills there sperm & internal organs and drink what will bring life to them. All I got to say is that the Brother did his thing and we need more people like him on this planet."
4,funny money and how to use it,"this book is quite humorous and also could prove useful to anyone stuck with too much dosh and considering a move to the suburbs. If you're just another over-extended day trader,it still has lots of laughs for now and wisdom for later. nice ""mad magazine"" style art work and fairly priced too."
2,Nothing New,"I picked this book up hoping to learn some new techniques on climbing the social ladder, but a lot of this is just common sense, and the stuff that isn't I had figured out on my own within a year after graduating. Also be aware (and this isn't really the author's fault) that some of his info is dated...With the release of the Hummer H2, and G-Wagon's being so affordable now, purchasing either one of these vehicles isn't nearly as powerful a statement as the author leads you to believe. If you are truly interested in learning about what it takes to distinguish yourself from the average people out there, I would direct your attention to Bernhard Roetzel's 'Gentleman' which I found to be far more informative."
3,Very informative and easy to understand,"This biography of Bill Gates had a lot of interesting facts about his entire life. It explained how he got started and how his company evolved. It also told about his family and his college years at Harvard. Many of his friends and associates are mentioned too. The book gave a little bit too much information at times but for the most part it was well-written. The author made Gates' work easy to understand even for someone who doesn't know much about computers. I believe this book would be great for a younger crowd to read but not for someone over 14 or 15. It is just on too low of a reading level. Since the book was written in 1997, it is somewhat outdated also. Other than that I liked the book a lot."
1,Surprisehim is a plague,"Surprisehim is a deceitful company. When I ordered this item it showed as the squeem with a vest attached, but unknown to me the code it assigned as for the item without the vest. When I tried to contact the company they said that that wasn't their problem, as far as they were concerned they sent the correct item. They would not exchange it either without the restocking fee. When I agree to the restocking fee and sent the item back it was returned to me because of an incorrect address. I rechecking the mailing address that the company gave when it sent this item and the one that I returned to was the same. This company is unwilling to work with customers in a fair manner and should be blocked from doing business with Amazon or anyone else. I've feel I've been robbed and cheated by a bunch of thieves. I was sold an item through trickery and they refuse to make it right."
3,great support wish the shape was different,"the product really squeezes you in the waist to give hourgblass figure. unfortunately it does not extend down the thighs to the knee, and the crotch are is cut kinda oddly, so although its crotchless you still have to take it off to use the bathroom. that would have been perfect."
2,Save yourself the cost...,"After hearing all the hype over these Squeem things I decided to try it out. After getting it in the mail, and squeezed into it. My waist looked ok - but my upper torso did not. The fat doesn't disappear, it gets moved to the place of least resistance (which happens to be the chest area). Now, it wasn't a ""feminine"" look at all, I looked more like a tomboy with it on. It wasn't a vuluptuous look, it made me look hefty. So, I would not recommend it at all, unless you favor the large upper torso ""butch"" look..."
2,Returned,I bought this item because I was looking for something that would hold me in especially when going out. I was totally disappointed with this product. Doesn't fit or hold you in good at all. I returned this product after trying it on. Don't waste your money.
1,unhappy,"I don;t like it> It very difficult to put on. In addition, it makes my dresses too small. I would like to return it but I threw the bag away. I need some help returning those two items. Thank you"
2,"Horrible, dont buy","This product is not comfortable. It is to tight in the stomach area, and loose in the thigh area. It is very difficult to put on."
4,"Helpful, but expensive","These CD's were a very good addition to my existing study program, which included text material, and both text Q&A and software Q&A. I probably wouldn't have passed without them. I loaded them on my ipod for use during exercise, played them in the car when commuting to and from work each day, and played them on my computer at work. Beware though, there are some misstatements/mispronunciations, and some topics are skipped. No need to buy the newer version to release in OCT 2008 - it's just more money. Buy used and save even more if you can. Don't use this as your only study material."
3,half good / half bad,"This kind of tool (audio cds) is grate for busy people. Mrs. Hopkins is good teacher and give adequate examples for study. My unique complaint is related to the product itself. Two of the five audio cds have a very very poor sound quality, but I've not fill a claim because I don't have enough time to study, so I set volume to maximum always that I have to listen it."
3,Good for commutes but low quality,"CDs 4 and 5 have really bad sound quality. The set doesn't include any Sarbanes Oxley info, they say it's sold separately(how inconvenient!). This definitely helps me stay focused on my goal of passing the AUD section and keeps my head unclouded of things like Soulja Boy and NPR."
3,How on Earth did it get a Dove Rating?,"Hi I rated this movie as 3 because it was filled with a bunch of talented actors and well written. But I purchased this as a family movie. There was just too much questionable content. Such as a married police officer hitting on a widow, a man in a coffee shop grabbing the widow and telling her he needed to make love to her, as well as other situations of infidelity and big time violence. It's not my type of movie but, I can see other adults enjoying it. I previewed this Thank God first because there would be now way it would work as a family time movie in our home. My main question is How on Earth did it get a Dove Rating?"
4,Insightful perspective on the Christian faith,"It is a joy to re-read this book after experiencing Palmer's journey through the years. I found the book to be just as engaging today as it was when it was first written. I found the new preface to be one of the best articulations of an authentic and well lived faith that I have ever read. He honors not only his faith, but the faith of all traditions, by demanding that it speak beyond the confines of religious communities and our ""inside"" language. His work for years, and now his faithful words, embody what the Christian faith has known as ""incarnational"" theology - the word made flesh. I appreciate this wonderful contribution to the ongoing conversation between faith and the public square."
4,He's written better,"I'm a Parker Palmer fan, but can't strongly recommend this particular book. The first essay which delves into Thomas Merton's thoughts on paradox was fresh and thoughtful. I could read that several times. I liked his essay on the Way of the Cross as well.Yet the subsequent essays were reworkings of previous writings. I expected the book to stick to the topic of Christian and spiritual paradox and thought the essays on education didn't fit. They also lacked specifics on Parker's own teaching. I'd get the book at the library as I did and read the first two essays."
2,not the greatest quality,"It's ok, but I was un-impressed.I think it is better to find a larger high quality kit and reduce it to a ""adventure kit"".This specialized kit is very limited in quality and quantity.I don't remember how much I paid, but it feels like a $5 kit."
2,Teenmo,"Artsy teenaged emo which rarely rises above low standards of fragmented, poorly recorded guitar work over typically shoddy singing."
2,Golden Pig in Chinese New Year,"Was surprised to find red eyes on the pig. Did not know that would be part of the pig package. Really would like to gouge them out. They seem, to me, cheapen the product."
5,"Yes, I WILL buy this video.","I love the Animaniacs. I used to watch them every afternoon, and this video provides a great way to get my fix any time of day. Attention college students: buy this video as a way to procrastinate! It's better than just sitting around!"
1,Quality control is completely absent,Don't buy this! I bought this to replace a metal one that was getting rusty. Thank goodness I still have the old one. I would not recommend this to anyone. The assembly instructions are almost non existent. The hardware doesn't match the white--gold colored screws on white? The holes do not align well and the fan back was too wide for the top shelf to attach. It's going in the trash.
1,"The Rhine: It's Scenery,and Historical and Legendary Associations","The book was colorless with very small print, not at all user friendly. It seemed mostly historical with obscure stories from the past. I needed something more modern for an upcoming trip."
1,Macally PodTape ipod cassette tape car adapter,This product does not work in all car cassette players. When played it gives you 1 sec of ipod music and then skips to what it thinks is the next track all the way through the cassette until it ejects itself. Don't buy this it is a big waste of money.
1,Worked great for over a year then skips tracks,"I bought this for my 98 Corolla and it worked great for over a year. Now it plays a track for a few seconds then skips forward and backwards tracks. It's quite strange, actually.All in all, I would not recommend this product."
1,"Terrible - Extremely Loud, Whirring noise, STAY AWAY","At first I thought it sounded OK, and that the little notch where the cable goes into the device was clever. Especially since my previous device died like that, frayed wire from the constant in and out of my car's tape deck. But I've had it for a few months and it has developed an annoying, super loud, high pitched whirring noise, more like racket. I have to get the volume up to 7 or 8 of 10 in the stereo to be listen to the music over the whirring."
5,metallica's got some balls,"in the 2 1/2 hours of the s&m concert my mind changed from ""what were they thinking"" to ""what was i thinking"" this is a great concert and dvd. who would have thought...metallica with an orchestra. well they took a risk and it paid off big time. what a concert...go buy this now if u don't have it. don't even finish reading my review cuz it's time u could spend watching this dvd. the extra stuff is awesome(40 min. doc., angles,etc..) and the 2 new songs are awesome. the orchestra adds even more life to the songs(for whom the bell tolls has never sounded better) point is go buy it...u won't regret it..trust me"
4,"DOLBY 2---2, not 5.1!",My advice is to wait for the remastered version in 5.1! Dolby 2? You got to be f---ing kidding!
5,incredible,"separate tracks for the symphony and metallica, or you can listen to them together- the product details is slightly wrong (says stereo sound, but its actually in dolby digital 5.1). if you're a metallica fan -- or even if you aren't but enjoy hard rock with a twist -- buy it."
5,Metal Meets Orchestra,"This is a high risk for both parties and it pays off big time. Mixing Metal with a classical orchestra turns out to be an excellent idea. What is kind of funny is seeing all the old people in the orchestra that are like ""I just wanna get paid and get out."" But what is really amazing is the last song ""Battery"". Adding an orchestra to a Thrash Speed Metal song is amazing and calls on very strong concentration on the orchestra. This is something you need to watch."
3,"Great concert, DVD lacking","Once again, Dolby Digital is used instead of the better sounding DTS. Each channel is sounding very forced, and it sounds like listening to several diffrent things at once rather than a multichannel audio DVD. The voice is really annoying in that the microphone is turned off between vocal parts, making each phrase sung rather startling. And the fact that they switched microphone information depending on which camera they were using is just distracting. It could've been a LOT better, but I don't regret buying it though."
5,Gateway to heaven,Perefect combination of Metallica and SF Symphony. Just play the DVD in a Home theater system and I promise you will feel you are in heaven. Its one album which I dont get bored watching zillions of times.A must buy for any Metallica fan.
5,Perfection in Musical Video,"I was sceptical at first when I got this DVD because I am not a fan of watching concerts on tape. But this one blew me away. The sound is amazing, even if you don't have the full-on Surround System. Camera angles never get boring and the whole stage is transformed into a spectacular of lights and patterns that just add to the excitement of the whole concert. But the real surprise arrives when you switch the sound options to ""just Orchestra"". Metallica like you've never heard them before. Weird at first to see them play but (almost) not hear them, but the Orchestra is amazing and seem to enjoy themselves, too, which makes it more fun to watch. I take a bow for the S.F. Symphonic Orchestra and Metallica for creating one of the best and unusual Rock Concerts ever recorded."
5,"Awesome DVD, don't miss it!","I'm 46 years old. I have seen/heard other rock/orchestra mixes in the past, namely Deep Purple and the London Royal Philharmonic, but these were ""concept"" things with all new material that no one was familiar with. Metallica pulled this off using their own known past material with excellent orchestral accompaniment by the San Francisco Symphony conducted by Michael Kamen. For those unaware, Kamen was the lead singer for a 70's band, New York Rock & Roll Ensemble. The boys' and Kamen's effort is about as awesome as I can conceive, on both VHS and DVD. Hearing the band and the orchestra together gives me goosebumps everytime I hear it. If Metallica were to tour with the orchestra, I would easily pay in exess of $100 per ticket for seats in the back. It is THAT stupendous and captivating."
5,Great Concert & Documentary,This was a great vidoeo no Metallica Fan Should ve without it! I reccoment the special edition because there is a 40 minute docuntary that show the making of the show.
5,A Must for the Metallica Fan,This is probably one of the best videos of the year. It's Metallica at its finest. All of their songs that they sing sound a lot more powerful with the symphony. The behind the footage tape has lots of cool footage of the concert. Michael Kamen is simply a genious. This only proves one thing: Metallica will continue to rock.
4,how do they keep doing it...,Everything Metallica touches turns to gold and rocks...this included. Songs like Fuel and Battery...awesome. Too bad no Creeping Death and too much crap from Reload.
5,Absolutely and totally awesome,"I was in awe as I watched this DVD the first time, and the second time was even better. I cannot imagine a better mix than one of the world's most popular heavy metal bands with one of the greatest symphony's in the world. I am not a very big heavy metal fan, but this DVD is well worth listening to, again and again. I would HIGHLY suggest you buy this, you WILL NOT regret it. It will take you to musical limits that you never imagined."
3,"Sounded Great On Paper, But They Couldn't Make It Work","Even though I'm a huge Metallica fan and would usually give anything they put out an automatic 5 stars (Even St. Anger!) whenever I listen to this i just dont feel anything, it basically sounds like Metallica are playing a normal show and the Symphony are just in the back trying to keep up. James says in the Doco. 'if it doesnt work all we can say is we tried', well u tried and unfortunatly u failed"
3,WHERE IS THE OTHER VIDEO?,"The second I saw This video at the music store I bought it. Then much to my suprise as I was at the mall the next week I saw the same S&M video with a bonus video attached of behind the scenes footage. So if you buy this video you will only get the concert tape, don't make the same mistake I did. Anyway the performance on the video is excellent. Metallica is in top form, as opposed to their usually sloppy live performance."
4,"Excellent, but...","Ok so we are all of the opinion that Metallica is the #1 band of all time. Unfortunatly they really shouldn't drop new songs into a medium like this. I was so lost on these cuts, I wanted to cut my hair off! The geeks with VCR's really need to spend some money and get a good DVD player. The DVD is very good, but for some reason it seemed that the editor of this 2 disc monstrosity, couldn't put it together if James or Lars themselves were standing over him with a 30.06 and a Mini-Gun! The editor should be sent to Siberia! Plus the 5.1 audio punched James' vocal up so high, one has to crank down the center channel almost by half! I like the Symphony & Band or band only, ect, as this is the only way you can her the two new ones, ""No Leaf Clover"" and ""-Human"" the way one normally is introduced to new stuff.1. The concert was great. 2. The documentary was very interesting, but too short. 3. How about a METALLICA CONCERT? Just Metallica. Nothing else.(Matters)"
1,What a waste!,"The Award goes to Hetfield and his mates:the Band and Songs are great, like we know them.Orchestration is pathetic, quite obviously aiming for the Wagnerian,but to no avail.Mr. Kamen has yet to learn that in order to sound like Wagner,you've got to write like Wagner.Pity the poor Orchestra..."
1,Metal and violins dont mix!,"What the hell was metallica thinking, they are a thrash band not Mozart!! St. Anger is a step in the right direction this is total garbage."
5,The #1 Concert ever.,"This video is the best especially the director ""Wayne Isham"" he took exellen shots of the band, and also the conductor ""Michael Kamen"" he made v-good background music, believe me the concert is much better than the music CD like: In ""The call of Ktulu"" you can't almost hear the guitars but in the video you can hear the guitars like the original track on ""Ride the Lightning"". James,Lars,Kirk,Jason played verry well but i think if Metallica made another S&M Concert they shall add: 1 - The Unforgiven 2 - Fade to Black 3 - The Unforgiven II 4 - Welcome Home (Sanitarium)Thanks alot for your reading......THE END..."
4,"Good product, served its purpose","Good product, exactly what I ordered/needed. Ordered in April '12 as I found a mink was eating my koi at night (in addition to the herons and who knows what other varmints). A bit of a tight fit, but managed to stretch it across the entire pond. Good for keeping the animals out as well as leaves, etc. Now it's early winter and I need to get my decaying summer floating plants out and it's a pain as the grass around the fringe of the pond has grown up through the netting edges making it near impossible to easily pull the netting off or back. Came back to my order today to see how much I'd paid for this and surprised to find it was only ~$30, so I don't mind just cutting the netting around the edges and taking the whole thing off for the winter and will buy a new one next year; small price to pay each spring to keep the fish alive I figure. Would work on finding an easier way to manage it next year though."
5,100% Addictive,"This is the best shojo anime ever! I'm warning you though, you'll get addicted very easily and NEED to have the rest once you start. It's definitely worth the cost. I've got the dubbed versions (since they're cheaper), and the character acting's pretty good. However, this prevents the viewer from hearing Chichiri say ""no da""... You'll absolutely fall in love with the characters (so many cute guys!). This kicks live action American soap operas in the butt!"
5,AWESOME!!! Just The Best Anime I have Ever seen!,"This is the best anime I have ever seen . Not only is it enjoyable but it made me want to see the rest of the episodes, Which are just as good as the first one! If you are going to buy these episodes, Get subtitled. It's so much better than dubed."
5,An Epic Biginning,"Hi, Whene I first saw the previw for this show on the end of one of my CCS Tapes i said to myself Hey that dosen't look half bad. I was Wrong. It was AWESOME I loved it. Now Iam tryin to get the box sets. Buy Buy Buy. This is the Epic biginning to an epic adventure that will keep you on your toes."
4,Not up to par,"I had heard so much about the Fushigi Yugi series, that I just had to try it and see for myself. So far, this is the only vol. I've seen. It seems like the story itself will become very interesting, but the animation has some drawbacks. The biggest let down is Miaka's voice. It sounds...[unrealistic], and, um...well, you'll have to listen to it yourself. However, I was very pleased with Tamahome's voice. ^_- The ""lovey-dovey"" parts of the story (a big part of it! ^_^) somehow hang in there and (particularly if you're a girl!) pull you in without seeming too unrealistic or melodramatic.For those parents or others out there who wish to know, there is a small amount of mild adult language, maybe what you would call ""adult situations,"" but nothing too bad.Overall, I was very pleased and can't wait to see more!"
5,The Best Anime,This anime is the best! I love it!!!! It's better than any other anime I ever seen! This anime is the greatest! I can't wait to get more of the tapes!
5,Totally Awesome!!!!,"When I first saw it, I had no idea that it would be this intense, funny, serious..... I got hooked on it after just five minutes of it. Everything is cool. The effects, the story line, the cliffhangers, and especially the guys. Especially The Guys! Hotohori and Tamahome! gotta watch it!!!!!!"
5,the most awesome anime series ever,"This title is WAY better subtitled- it's worth the extra money to hear the voices of the best voice actors in Japan. Heck, who can beat Seki Tomokazu (voice of Chichiri)?"
3,"The sub is better, the dub was good though.","This was pretty good for a dub (I do NOT like Hotohori's voice though. It's just /wrong/! And Nuriko's is worse!) Tamahome and Miaka were well cast, though. I cannot wait to see what they do with Tasuki (everybody's favorite Kansai potty-mouth) and Chichiri (NO DA!). Tomo should be interesting, too.Ah, so many bishonen, so little time..... *drool*"
5,I LOVE THIS SHOW,Hi ive loved this show ever since ive seen when i saw a picture from it i fell in love with the show i said to myself this has to be great it has everything you could wish for in a show comedy action adventure romance sad parts everything and im happy i can get it here...
3,Decent,"The biggest trouble with this set is that The Drifters and The Miracles and The Crystals songs are not the originals but new recordings. Otherwise, there's a fun mix of original tunes to upgrade your collection."
4,Another cowboy and indian story?,"The vision quest of Crazy Horse as a young man shows us that the culture of these plains Indians wasn't primitive. In the 300 years since the Spanish brought horses to the new world,they had changed and adapted their hunting culture to the horse.That Indians ever won a battle with American regular troopswho had modern weapons and military training,shows that the Indian generals like Crazy Horse could learn and adapt.I think that this side of American history needs to be told and retoldas it points to the treaty breaking political nature of our culturethat in many ways mimiced the British Empire in Indiain the double dealings with the people of the lands taken.The slaughter of the Indians and the shipping of the young to schoolsshattered these cultures completely.It is pretty much a cultural eminent domain story..."
2,"Oh, Geez!","Didn't like this one. Glad to see Native actors/actresses, but this portrayal of Crazy Horse way off the mark as far as I was concerned. Maybe not quite as bad as the first one--Chief Crazy Horse (from the 50s with Victor Mature), but not much better either. Too much Hollywood here--lots of paint horses and feathers. KL"
4,Works great,Unit works great but noise level on high is too loud. Install easy if you have the right tool for the job.
4,Recommend upgrade to Platinum,"A little complicated to use if you have never used conversion software before. This only allows you to copy DVDs. However, there are free versions out there that can do this.If you want to convert to various formats (WMVs, AVIs, DIVX, etc) recommend to get the Platinum version. Allows you to all the above, as well as adjust the size and bitrate of your output files."
5,"""The Diva Soars On The Wings Of Her Own""","If you were alive on the planet in 1986, chances are you heard the name PATTI LABELLE. There are only 5 videos on the DVD,-On my own she just make you wanat more.-New attitude she begin to warm you up-Oh people your heart is racing-Somebody loves you baby, you are holding your heart.-If you asked met to you are ready for the bedroom. Think where you were doing these songs. This is an outstanding DVD it is a must have for all of Miss Patti fans. There will never be another Patti Labelle she is a living for many years to come."
4,Patti LaBelle (The DVD Collection),"track listings: 5 songs TOTAL--on my own, new attitude, oh people, if you asked me to, & somebody loves you baby/you know who it is.I rated this music videos DVD a 5 (EXCELLENT)."
2,not for me,"Imagine having pages of famous quotes read to you straight without any explanation other than a brief summary intro. Also does not have any examples of modern day implementation or how people use these concepts today. Perhaps most useful for someone with a taoist teacher or part of a taoist temple, but not really for a solo beginner. While most of the statements are easily understood & true, many are obvious cliches & it gets a little boring. Wish I had rented from the library, do not buy unless you have money to throw away."
5,great finch feeder,"This finch feeder is simple and effective, judging from the number of birds on it most of the time, and best of all easy to clean. Clean fresh seed is very important and all you do is slide the bottom perch thru and voila! the bottom comes off for easy cleaning."
1,Squirrels immediately destroyed it,"This feeder has a plastic cylindrical body with metal perches and small openings above the perches for the finches to get to the seed. For me, it took 1 day for the squirrels to find the feeder, chew a large hole through it and destroy it. If you are getting a thistle feeder, get one either with a squirrel baffle cage around it, or one that has metal rims around each of the feeding stations. (Although the other Droll Yankees feeder of that type which I have also lets the squirrels get most of the seed from a small opening around the metal bottom where the rain is supposed to be able to escape.)"
5,"Enjoyable, Entertaining, and Educational","I bought this book to help give me some different authentic words for my western stories. I didn't know I'd derive so much enjoyment from doing research! Cowboy Lingo not only gave me interesting phrases, but it's full of information about their mannerisms, clothing, horses, names, and habits. I know I'm leaving out some things because the book is too full of all the tidbits a good writer needs to know. Plus, Ramon Adams will make you laugh if nothing else. The book is lively unlike a lot of other research books that I find dull. I recommend it for all types of readers whether you're writing your own novel or just want some fun."
4,The Return,The return of Elton and Bernie in all thier glory.You can't be an Elton fan without this one.
4,One surprise return....,This is such an underrated album of such absolutely Elton-Taupin quality. The selected songs and deliveerance is remindfull of their past cannot stop ventures of 70's and early 80's. Ther verses of Taupin is right with the best and Ellton's playing and deliverence of the music rates with his best. There is not one flaw in these recordings and each stands own its own. If you enjoy Elton this will not dissapoint you and bring you with surprises that are welcome.
3,New kitchen table,"This was a first for me, buying a kitchen table and chairs online and from an Amazon supplier. I have no problems with the kitchen table or chair quality as it was exactly what I pictured I wanted for the kitchen and for the price, it is fine.I did have a problem getting this delivered, however. No fault of the shipper, but the shipping company did not see this was marked as going to a residence and had it on a 55 foot trailer needing a dock to unload. The shipping company actually wanted to meet me at their last plant delivery in the area to dump it off onto the back of my pickup.It took a week for this to get worked out, not the fault of the company I was doing business with but Milan Trucking sure did show how ignorant they were.A nice table and chairs, just what I wanted and everyone likes it here."
4,CAMPY PRODUCTION,"The cover has nothing to do with the movie. This movie reminded me of an adult version of Bible man superhero type show. Tanya Dempsey has the acting ability of a porn star, but keeps her skimpy clothes on during the whole movie. Only demons get naked. We do discover that demons live on earth disguised as humans and like a bad Romulan cloaking device, they must reveal themselves prior to attacking. The movie was campy and at times had a ""Japanese Sci-Fi"" flavor to it. It would be a perfect candidate for an MST-3000 episode."
3,Guard oneself,"Despite the cover this is not a film about vampires. It's about demons (to me that makes all the difference in the world). In this film there's a secret organisation that picks up on disturbances in the fabric of the universe in LA with a special monitoring system. When a demon comes through to our world, a person's sent over to send them back... by shooting them. Great story! (not!)A very stupid premise. And in LA I'd think it'd be very hard to tell who's who, from people of this realm from all others."
2,Woof,"I bought this book because Callahan is one of my favorite cartoonists. He has a razor wit and creative bent unique in our time. However, this book is merely a retrospective of the development of Callahan's art over the years (I'm assuming; the panels are undated). Many of the early pages are useless as humor; their only value is for an academic or a family friend. Many of the drawings are crude (early career?), and many of the concepts are repeated or are just not enlightening as humor. I was hoping for a collection of his finest work. Digested and passed in twenty minutes. Woof."
4,Second pair of Original Time Trader Stories,"I read these in high school and enjoyed them, although the second book was not as good as the first, for me. Still a good read."
1,DO NOT BUY this product,"I applied this stuff to 3 metal parts on my motorcycle, all the parts were pre primed and dried and cleaned before application. I left for vacation and returned 4 days later. when I inspected the parts the coating was still not dry, it flaked off in my hands ruining over 100 dollars worth of parts. still not dry after 4 days of 80 degree 50% humidity san diego weather. this stuff is of poor quality. do not apply it to anything."
3,Nice Addition,"Pretty lame toy by itself, but hook it to the ""Tomb Trap"" or other rev-up track, and it's a cool addition. Overall, I like these little rev-up trucks."
1,Toy pinched child's finger.,"My child's finger got caught and pinched by toy. Really painful for him and difficult to remove his finger from where it was pinched without the toy cutting his finger. Also, track doesn't stay together well or stay in the circle form well. Mattel and CPSC have been notified."
4,Worth the money,"I bought these HID's after looking into many different brands. My friend actually recommended these to me as well. The first set that arrived were the wrong bulbs. They quickly responded to my email and sent a second set. The second set came with one bulb burned out. Again, they quickly responded and replaced the defective bulb. The bulbs look great on my car now and work perfectly. I give them four stars because the HID's are a great value and the customer service was excellent. Overall I am very happy."
5,Kingdom Authority,"This is yet another wonderful book by one of the great conservative Bible preacher-teachers. I have a number of Dr. Rogers's books, booklets, dvd's etc. and I consider them valuable assests to my personal library. I treasure these works as great helps to my own sermon and teaching preparations. I highly recommend this book to those who seek the truths of God's Word."
3,The Incredible Power of the Kingdom Authority,"I received my book and found it to be in excellent condition. There was some underlining but does not hurt the text. It was well wrapped and arrived in a very timely fashion this morning in the mail.I find this a very satisfactory way of finding books I cannot find anywhere else.Thank you,J Catt"
2,Work In Progress.......,This game is difficult to figure out. For the company's target range eight years and up need a simpler format to follow. It would've been nice for the characters to show step by step instructions.
2,American Girls Premiere,"The American Girls Premiere had bad graphics and was not very exciting.The voices to choose from for your play were unrealistic.A small child would be very frustrated with this game because some of the instructions are unclear.Older children would probably enjoy this game,though."
4,"Great pictures, text not bad either but the typos?? Ugh.","This book left me with mixed feelings. It has great pictures and amazing help with color. The pictures speak thousand words. This book helps by just using the pictures as a reference when you are doing your painting. The text is ok, to my opinion hard to follow directions. I like step by step, this is not it. And one annoying thing in this book... the number of typos. Michelle, you have a talent, but PLEASE have somebody proofread your work next time before you publish. It looks very unprofessional and for the cost of this book, these types of typos are unacceptable to me. Hence the four stars, although my tru rating should be 3.5. It's better than 3 but not quite 4 stars."
2,Black and White!!!,"I don't understand whey write the first book in color and the second one, on a very important topic that deserves color and put it in black and white!!!???"
3,not bad,"good performance from the mARK III line up,..one of the earliest show of mark III,..DP fans must have this one"
1,The Borrowers VHS with Ian Holm,"This was a wonderful TV series, but this VHS looks as if it was made by someone sitting in their living room videotaping it with a camera from the TV screen. It's unwatchable."
5,"SI TE LEVANTAS DISGUSTADA, ¡YA SE AMOLO TU DÌA !","¡TE HAS FIJADO ?^Pero esta obra, te cambia cada dìa del años. Simplemente, lee la frase que corresponde a cada fecha, y lo primero que entre a tu mente serà un pensamiento positivo y agradable!Eso, mi amiga, cambiarà tus dìas y tu vida..."
1,Not like the old sets!!!!,"My step-mother bought three sets of this for me for Christmas. Scarlet, cobalt and tangerine. I had seen the tourquoise set that my good friend has had for more than ten years, and was impressed. Well, these are NOT the same. They were already coming apart when we took them out of the box. After two years, I have an odd fork or spoon left. It is very sad! I emailed Fiesta and they said that they no longer make these or the glassware, which is also low-quality now.It really stinks, because they look so great, when they match!Buyer, beware!!! If you find the old ones, snatch them up quick!"
3,Much missed toy after pegs disintegrated,"The best thing about this toy was that its pegs were really a tight fit, so the pounding was satisfying. The downside was that, after a while, the pegs -- being plastic -- just fell to bits. I'm trying to decide on a replacement. Even though my son is already 3, he really enjoyed this toy a lot and I think Santa should bring him a new one."
3,A controversial account of a fascinating time,"Reading some of the reviews of this book seems to be almost as interesting as reading the book itself! However, I do feel the need to set the record straight on a few points. While it is true that most of the content of the speeches that Thucydides records are historically inaccurate, it is a grave fallacy to say that the facts he records are ""lies."" As was true of all authors of the time, Thucydides' text was written to further a political, military, and social agenda. The speeches of the work are not recorded verbatim, granted, but does that make Pericles' funeral oration any less beautiful and poignant? It reminded me very significantly of Vietnam, in all honesty. Instead of holding Thucydides to a modern historical standard, why not appreciate him for the excellent speechwriter and persuasive argumentarian that he was?"
4,"A concise, accurate history of the Peloponnesian War","A history of the Peloponnesian War written by Thucydides, a general who participated in the early actions of the war.This history starts from what caused the war, a detailed history of the war, and its effects on the whole of Greece.All in all, this is a great book on the Peloponnesian War and is very accurate."
5,Great Book,I am a total history buff and this book has really expanded my knowledge. Great to use in class to gain that upper hand in the philosophical arguments. I highly suggest you pick it up.
5,Great Buy!,Such a great buy. really cheap which is perfect since I need it for a class im taking. came just in time for the new semester!
5,History as Story,"By fortune, for me, Thucydides came first in college...followed not long after by David Halberstam's The Best and the Brightest... followed by Neil Sheehan's A Bright and Shining Lie.Like Gibbon, Toqueville and so many others, the story teaches."
1,Not helpful,"I have Morton's Neuroma in my left foot. I hoped that buying a pad to address the one foot problem would be an ideal solution compared to purchasing sets of insoles. Unfortunately, this pad did not work for me. My neuroma is more uncomfortable than super painful.I had hoped that since my neuroma is minor that this would work, but I was disappointed. I could not tell any difference, particularly as the day went on. Insoles are much better. Take the $5 bucks and put it towards a set of insoles instead."
4,Buy a pair! They work.,"These are easy to put on, don't irritate toes, and stay in place all day. If you wear them daily, consider two or three pads since they need to be washed regularly (like your socks) to avoid foot odors and to fluff the foam padding back up. I've never seen these in department stores--only at Amazon."
2,cushion,"you only get one of these in the package. it's just a little better than the terrycloth one i got ,but it too is misleading. he didn't work for me."
2,Temporary relief,"I had horrible pain in my foot over the summer and went to the doctor who diagnosed me with hammertoe. She told me I needed orthotics but I couldn't afford them so I looked online for some alternatives. The pain was mostly in the ball of my foot so when I found this cushion, I thought it would be perfect! So, the first couple of days, I loved it! However, the cushion moves a lot so I ended up having to use tape to keep in place which was a pain. Then after 2 weeks, the cushion was completely flat and provided no relief. Now, I have to provide full disclosure that I work in downtown Chicago which means I do a ton of walking (3-4 miles per day). So I wonder if the cushion would last longer for someone who didn't do the heavy walking I do but even then I question the durability of the product. Overall, it was cheap which I can't complain about and it did provide a few days of pain free walking but I would not purchase it again."
3,Overall Average Series,"Putting the brief profanity and questionable lifestyles of her characters aside, Jane Peart is a talented writer, and gifted."
5,Just what I needed...,"I was looking for a guide to reptiles in my area, and this book was recommended by at least two local experts as THE guide to have. They were right...easy to ID the snakes and frogs we find."
4,Just FYI...,"I don't believe there's anything on this CD that you can't get elsewhere. The Loki games (they're all demos, by the way) are all available from Loki; the rest of the games are all open-source games that you can download elsewhere. The real value of this package is that you don't have to spend untold hours on Freshmeat tracking down each of these individual games, downloading, compiling, et cetera."
5,Beautiful Izzy,"Izzy Gordon a new brasilian aqquintance to me..but wow...how could I do anything but fall in love with her music.This album is loaded with compassion and beautful music,performed with such ease and still with that conviction and distinction that is so appealing.It all starts up with "" O negocio e amar"" relaxed and nicely and then there is a nice mix of accoustic bossa and more funk related grooves.There is also a humoristic touch like in "" Estrada do Sol""Some great guitar soloing as well.Recommended to anyone that loves the bossa and can take time to really listen to this music performed by an outstanding brasilian lady and singerAnders JonassonSept 4 2007"
5,A Warm and Wonderful Book,"Having read the first two of Suzanne Strempek Shea's books, I looked forward to this one eagerly. I was amply rewarded. This work, LILY OF THE VALLEY, is her best yet. It's a rich, warmly told story of an artist, 39-year-old Lily Wilk, living in a small New England town in the present. All of the tale is spun with an honesty and beauty that make reading it a delight. I even tried to slow down at the end to make it last! If I could add another star, I would."
3,Disappointing...,"I very much liked SELLING THE LITE OF HEAVEN and I loved HOOPI SHOOPI DONNA. LILY OF THE VALLEY, it seems to me, was cranked out much too fast and after plowing through half of it, I've set it aside in favor of reading other novels. This is very distressing to me because I really enjoyed -- and raved about -- HOOPI SHOOPI DONNA, and have sent it to a number of my friends. And, no, I'm not Polish.<G>"
3,Wistful but depressing,"Lily Wilk , aged nearly 40, lives in the same small town that her family has lived in since they emigrated to the US from Poland. As a child, she finds that she has a talent for drawing and eventually makes that her full time job, doing calligraphy and painting signs for shops.When her parents move to Florida, she moves into the upstairs flat over the local fish shop, leading a moderately happy life until the break up of her marriage to her childhood sweetheart.I get the feeling that she is more unhappy about not seeing her ex husbands' son by a former marriage, than the actual loss of er husband, a fact which makes her more depressed than ever. She is commissioned to paint a family portrait by the towns' wealthiest woman, a recluse who fought her way to the top by selling vegetables from a push cart.The whole story consists of snippets from both Lilys' family and that of her client, but it just doesn't jell properly and left me feeling dissatisfied and vaguely depressed."
3,A very slow moving book!,"The book ,in the beggining, was starting to sound really great but as I read more it started to get really slow. The book in some parts is a little drawn out. But on the bright side, the Charater Lily is a very indenpedent woman and well on her way, but she goes back to her past way too much. This opportunity for her to be the big painter she wants to be should be talked about more than her big past because it is starting to get really boring. If you talked more about her love of the man she truly cared about and her times with her friends that made her laugh. It would have been really great to get into. Sorry about the slow moving novel but it could have been better."
2,What did she say?,"Generally a poor documentary. The gentleman responsible for the filming is a photographer and a pretty good one judging from the photos included in the video. Unfortunately, he is not quite as good at videography. We love hummingbirds, so the subject was intereseting enough. However, it was edited poorly and the narration was not very well written and difficult to understand.I believe I would be more generous with my review if the DVD was less expensive or if I could understand what the narrator was saying. Definitely not worth the price."
2,Difficult to understand the narration,"Although the image quality was excellent, as one would expect from modern HD video equipment, the narration was very difficult to understand. I watched the story in company of two visitors whose first language is Spanish, and a native English-speaker; all of us could only understand the majority of the narration. This film would be for children, having the tone of a story for kids; anthropomorphizing animals is the classic conceit of children's tales. At least it would be if it were intelligible."
2,"Loved viuals, terrible sound & narration","The visuals were fascinating (did you know a hummingbird egg is the size of a coffee bean?) and the hatching was adorable. However, we gave up and watched it as a silent movie because the sound was annoyingly muffled and we could understand almost nothing of the narration. Why in the world didn't they (a) provide captions or (b) have someone else narrate it? Her voice is pleasant and soothing, but there was no point in listening to the narration at all; I wasn't even sure she was speaking English until I caught a stray word or two. I would have liked to hear the background music, but unfortunately, I couldn't because the sound was off. Frustrating! I am going to return it and get the one with F. Murray Abraham.I bought the DVD as a Christmas gift for my husband. I wish I had bought the book."
4,"Amazing Photography, Sweet Story Line, Sound Quality Could Be Better","What a nice story covering most aspects of the hummingbird. Educational and entertaining. Sound Quality could be better though, seemed muffled to me."
4,No issues with product or service,Order 1 pack of 6-CD jewel cases. There were 5 cases in the package: the package was delivered ahead of schedule. I have been using the multi-CD jewel cases for about a week without any issues. The cases are durable.
4,nice item,"good value for the money. doesn't always seal the best. Overall, like I said, a good deal for the money."
5,Maxell CD Clam Shell Cases.....,"The product is great for storage of CD's and DVD's, and also for shipping and Road Trips. You see Im Old School"
4,Exactly what I needed,"As a freelance graphic designer, I need to mail CDs to clients in something sturdy and lightweight: these perfectly fit the bill."
5,Great for Gamers,"I bought these to put in my PS3 Case. I was hoping that they would be thin enough, small enough to slide into the slots.. the same sort of slots that one has with those 'Visor cd' cases.They fit. Now I can carry my game DVD/CDs in the slots without worry of them getting scratched in the slots.. which eventually happens in those types of things.have fun"
2,No tabs to open,"These clam-shell cases were thin, hard to close, and did not have the tabs on the top to help you open the cases. Because they are thin, they are very flexible, and I could see that a CD could get bent with enough pressure placed on them incorrectly. I could easily bend them with my fingers. The thicker clam-shells do not bend -- if you use your fingers to try to bend them. However, they are adequate for the job of providing better protection than paper sleeves."
1,Awkward,"I found these to be some what difficult to open and close. To ""latch"" closed you have to push on the very middle of the case in the spindle area. Also the cd does not want to stay centered, so you first have to carefully center the cd first then close. Every person I gave one of these to had difficulty getting it latch shut. Also all the cases had a residue on the inside that got on the cd's. I had to wipe out each case before use."
4,"great product, wont break if dropped.","I got tired of plastic CD cases breaking on impact, also the little piece of plastic that holds the lid always broke off. This product is all plastic and single mold. Please remember, after you put your CD in, *press on the center of the case to lock it*, it took me a few minutes to realize how it works and I kept pressing the sides hoping that it will lock."
4,Clear Case makes it easy to see CD label,"Clear is better. With the colored clam-shell cases, you can't see the CD label through the colored plastic. Yes, the cases are a bit thin but they work just fine. If they were thicker, I would have given a 5-star rating."

1,Oh Please!,"It's really a pity that some people never seem able to admit when a theory is really a theory. This is a eloquent and educated work, but evolution is as much a religion as this writer claims it is not. As it's own blurb puts it ""it is not surprising that a great deal of information is either glossed over or omitted entirely"". This is attributed to 'avoiding controversial subjects'. Yet the author can so clearly and concisely present all other arguments? Forgive me, but the entire issue is controversial and is only a very recent argument in our history. Anyone who reads this book should also check out 'The FACE that Proves the Farce' by Hank Hanagraph and some of the valid arguments against evolution. Unless, of course, they prefer to be force fed this theory without educating themselves on both sides of the argument. By the way do you know that even the best colleges in our nation and the world are questioning this theory that we have been sold. Check it out."
1,Evolution triumphed?,"That's news to me. The latest stats I read say that about 45 percent of Americans take the Genesis account more or less literally, while another 45 percent believe in some variant of ""intelligent design,"" or ""theistic evolution."" The latter group includes many scientists, not the least of them the head of the Human Genome Project.Zimmer may feel that evolution (in the atheistic sense) deserves to triumph, but so far, it's come up flat. It won't gain any adherents by treading out the same old tired arguments that have been refuted again and again, the way Zimmer does."
3,No imagesnwith kindle version,"I have nothing bad to say about the content (text) of this book. The kindle version, however, has been stripped of all ilustrations, images and pictures. A real shame. If you expect to buy the kindle version as a more portable version of the real book, you will be sorry."
4,really enjoyable,as someone who is a novice when it comes to biology I found this book highly enjoyable. I can't believe that people can look at all the evidence and not come away with an unshakable belief in evolution. Evolution is the foundation of all biology.
5,Perfect,As a Bio teacher It connected superbly. I now have a second hero. ( Carl Sagen & Carl Zimmer) PJ Lauer
5,Golden Bonbon,"The candy is really, good, but I only paid $6.00 for it. It has to be a typo at 54.00, shouldn't it be $5.40?"
5,Super handy!,"Lets me put power anywhere I need it on the ceiling, and with a grounded tap. I checked with an outlet tester and it does ground correctly."
2,"Not as ""simple"" as it claims to be.","The basic features of SPSS are fairly simple, and I believe this book complicates things more than anything else. It's quite verbose and pretty much fails to be straightforward on all counts. Towards the last half of my statistics course I found myself not reading it at all and just listening to my professor explain it in class, and not reading it actually helped me more than reading it.If you know someone who understands SPSS, it's probably best just to have them walk you through whatever aspects of it you need to understand."
3,"Uh, maybe next time?","I had high hopes for this recording given the line-up. Unfortunately, the recording isn't all that great although the performances aren't bad. Ribot has some great moments... Mostly it just sounds a little too dense for my taste. In fact, most of Zorn's stuff as of late has been mildly unimpressive. I really hate to say that too, because he was such a powerful force in the early days - with the early filmworks series and of course Naked City and Masada.After this purchase, I think I'll just lay off of Zorn for awhile... ...and to think I used to be a Zorn completist...The shame is, this could've been a great recording had it been done in a studio and the songs were a little better rehearsed."
2,Not Very Happy,The cup broke about 2 or 3 weeks after it was purchased.....it was only hand washed. I have had other cups like this one but purchased at other stores and those have broken as well. Not sure if it is the material used to make the cup if it can withstand the freezer like they claim because they end up cracking very quick. Not going to spend money on these anymore because they will not replace them and you cant get your money back either.Not happy
5,I could not put it down,"In my opinion, the author wrote this book for a spiritual cleansing. It is a must read for all of us, and our loved ones who need inspiration from someone who has lived on the dark side of sex, crime & drugs.Miss Kert shows us the light at the end of the tunnel."
5,Stunning Knitted Rugs,What a beautiful book! It is filled with lots of full page colorful photos and very clear instructions on how to knit a variety of rugs - from easy garter stitch to more complicated intarsia; from braided rugs to celtic cables; from patchwork rugs to shaker pinwheels. I am so pleased to add this to my knit book collection and am eager to begin a knitted rug project for myself and eventually for gifts.
4,"Not all funny, but happy","Lenny Ravich wrote a book. His attitude towards life is look at the bright side, don't sweat the small stuff. Or keep sweating but laugh about it. So no surprise that many of the jokes aren't that funny. Who cares? Some of them are poignant, and some are old but still good because they ring true. Anyway, this is not a joke book and Ravich is not a comedian. Just an honest, healthy guy who sees the humor in life. I came out of reading the book not feeling enlightened - just more ready to laugh at myself. Goodness knows I need that. Did we forget what we knew as children? Laughter is not only for funny, but also for happy!"
5,Cutting the Crap our of Craps,"Anyone who is serious about playing craps should read this book. I would especially recommend this book to new players and anyone who has never played before but is considering playing craps. After reading this book, you will know more about craps than 90% of the players. Only 1% of long-term craps players are winners. This book will definitely help to put anyone in that 1% group."
5,Extremely well made and sturdy,"This is by far the best percussion mounting bar I have ever seen. It offers extreme stability, flexibility, and strength in one relatively affordable package. If you want the best that will last a lifetime, this is it."
5,cute board book for little train lovers,"Little Lionel Night Train5 starsThis board book is 10 pages long. The storyline is about a streamlined steam locomotive, the Chesapeake and Ohio line, which is pulling coaches and tank cars filled with milk and chocolate syrup (!). The trip is an overnight journey, which begins at night and ends the next morning. The passengers are looking out of the windows at the various sights and then they sleep on the train overnight. The text tells of the journey, over rails, over bridges, through tunnels, etc. The language in the text is highlighting opposite words such as above and below, up and down.Because this is a Lionel book the illustrations of the train cars are detailed and accurate, much more so than other train board books on the market that are not published by Lionel.Both of my children love this book and others in the series. If you like this book please note that this is one of a series published as ""Little Lionel"" board books. Enjoy!"
5,Comprehensive!,"I have used the Burnham book for five years in my Introduction to American Law class of foreign LL.M students. This is the only book I have found that gives such a comprehensive introduction to American law. It provides an excellent survey. It is at once complete enough to use alone for a course, and at the same time useful as a foundation for special exploration of specific areas of interest."
2,Good,This Book is very broad but every chapter is extremely brief and it could be better. I would check another introductory book.
3,SOME GOOD INFO HERE FOR THE FORECASTER TO CONSIDER.,"DON'T LET THE TITLE FOOL YOU, THIS IS NOT A BOOK FOR ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS. SOME MATH SKILLS ARE DEFINITELY NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE SENSE OF THE CONCEPTS. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN SOME MORE PRACTICAL EXAMPLES, PARTICULARLY SOME FROM OUTSIDE THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY."
2,bummed out...,"I had high hopes for this, but it just didn't do much, other than smell better than the usual treatments."
4,Excellent Book,"This book is brilliant. It goes into depth regarding the history, and has lots of pictures."
5,really good book,"I LOVE THIS BOOK. This brother speaks nothing but the truth. On page 58-59 when he talks about ""chitlin circuit"" plays, I almost fell out laughing. This book is painfully true. I love Brother Camara."
4,Speaking the Truth,"This book hits on so many truths about the black church; from mind control to financial brainwashing (the filling of church coffers).All the praising and praying in the world (to improve your situation) is useless unless you back it up with a plan and self-determined action to make it a reality.The church is also the richest institution in the black community, but does it lead the way to encourage economic progress or address the aids issue?Unfortunately, the people who really need to be enlightened by this book are the same people who will never read this book.I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 stars because in my opinion the author repeated himself far too often for my taste."
2,book,I was unable to get into book. It wasn't a valuable read for me. I actually gave the book away. I know I purchased a used book but was disappointed by the overall appearance.
1,Don't blame the church you haven't been to all of them.,"I purchased this book at a Black Writer's on Tour event in Los Angeles several years ago. Jeremiah Camara misrepresent the book when I met him. He sold me on the book and I decided I would read it later but before I read it I stop by his presentation at the conference and walked out. As I walked out he made eye contact and smiled, almost laughing at me. If he thinks the church is misleading people he needs to take a look within. I am glad I meet him and I still pray for him. The paper the book is printed on is more valuable than the information contained.The bible tells us to study ""2Ti 2:15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."" The responsible ultimately upon us to study for ourselves and live an honorable and respected life the best we can."
5,Nothing But The Truth,"Jeremiah Camara is absolutely on point with his evaluation of the impact of the Black church on the collective psyche of the Black community. Like it or not, it is way past time for us to step outside of our emotional attachment to the church, and take a good hard look at what we are learning from our pulpits and whether or not the sermons we are hearing are practical and useful in our everyday lives. In as much as we may enjoy the emotionalism and edutainment of the Black church, we must do a better job of looking dispassionately, logically and critically at our financial, professional, familial, and educational lives and begin to make rational decisions grounded in fact that line up with what we say we want. This book is a definite must read for anyone willing to take the next step and move into a higher realm of thinking and being."
5,Bravo!! Jay B.,"Jeremiah Camara has done what should have been done a long time ago. What an excellent book! I actually read it twice. I have been attending church all my life but the truth is the truth. I recommend this book for everyone especially black preachers. The book is so well written. Now, when I attend church I see exactly what Mr. Camara is talking about. This is one of, if not the most important book a black person can read. This is an abosolute classic. Jeremiah Camara is a courages man. It's time to realize that we need to become more intellectual as a people. Please read this book. And above all---keep an open mind."
4,Financial salvation,Enlightens the reader about the true purpose of far too many churches. They are created for the financial salvation of the minister not the spirtual salvation of the members. Tithes and offerings are not the keys to the Kingdom of God. Members worship the minister instead of God. A must read for traditional church goers.
4,EndNote always good,"Takes a little training and adjustment for APA style, but overall better than doing it all by hand."
4,"Great Quality, but a little undersized.","The collar came very quick and was great quality. The only issue, would the the size measures from tip of bucklet to tip of belt, add several inches to the measured size to get a proper fit for your dog."
2,"Stirring tales of Victorian campaigns, BUT...","While this is an interesting book, it is exactly the same material as his other two. This title has the exact same material as 'The Savage Empire' with a more photos in it, nothing more. His other title while thicker, is the same stories that this book has in it. I feel ripped off by three different titles, by different publishers and the same material, as I mentioned, that are in the other titles - exactly the same stuff. Very disapointing. I shall be more careful if I order another of Mr Hernon's books. Too bad, as they do have some mighty interesting tales in them. Buyer beware, indeed."
5,A wonderful resource!,A comprehensive -- and comforting! -- resource for anyone who has worked through the demands of a solo librarian's role!
4,"Stupid plot, but SUPER-SEXY NONETHELESS!!!","This movie reminded me of those boring police shows on television, except that unlike the TV shows, this one included lots of nudity! And even I will admit that Shannon Whirry is HOT enough to make me sit through something I might otherwise quickly lose interest in! Her scene with her female psychiatrist was the best part of this film --- yes, they were naked and enjoying eachother's bodies! But don't ask me about the rest of the plot because I don't remember!"
5,GREAT MOVIE,AWESOME MOVIE SHANNON WHIRRY IS SIMPLY AT HER BEST IN THIS ONE. I WISH THEY COULD RELEASE THIS ON DVD
4,More of Vanessa Williams video's.,"I've recently purchased this dvd. It's really nice to go back in time and remember what I was doing when I first heard the ""Right Stuff"" by Vanessa Williams. Althou there's only 5 of her videos, wishing to see more from a Great Diva in the future!"
4,the better and the worst,"Jurassic park was (and still) one of my favorite movie. I've watch it so many times, I know it by heart. It's full of suspence, great strorylines, amazin specials effects and it's a Stephen Spieilberg film... That movie had cut my braith away. But, the sequel as to much exgeration, like much more death, dinosaurs and others. That make the movie realy not realistic, like the first one.But, it's still Jurrasic Park..."
1,Jurassic Park/Lost World DVD collectors edition,"What a bunch of crap, I bought it because it said it had over 60 minutes of new footage. The length in time for both movies was the same as the VHS editions.Very big disappointment"
1,The worst of American Crap.,"There are no finer examples of pure Hollywood excrement than these two films. No logical plot, no character development, no reason to see either of these films. IF YOU VALUE QUALITY ENTERTAINMENT SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
4,worth having,"Obviously there are quite a few people who had problems with this DVD set, however I had no problem with any of the features. The video looks great and so does the audio, although I was surprised that it wasn't filmed in the extra wide 2.35:1 aspect ratio, but with my regular TV that was alright. Granted, neither movie is high on plot, but everybody knows that about these movies. These are great flicks to crank up the stereo and scare your neighbors with, which is essentialy what they were made for to begin with, fun, fast and loud entertainment. I wish they had a little more revealing trailer for the next movie, but they probably don't have much done. It would have been better if they had more deleted scenes or bloopers, but I think these are still worth owning."
2,Buy it for the films: there's not much else special.,"Lame for a DVD, especially a ""Collection"" boxed set. The ILM and Dinosaur bonus material? STILLS! Okay there are the two standard ""How we made the movie"" documentaries that have been on TLC, Discovery etc. and if you haven't seen them they are nice to be included but rather expected.BUT what is totally stunning to be absent is any sort of Voice-over commentary for either movie. Where's somebody giving commentary on how the scenes were shot, logistics etc. that are the one unique aspect of DVD? None here. For two films as viually complex as these that's inexcusable. So everybody concerned was too busy to spare two hours to do commentary? Excuse us.Typical perfect DVD image but otherwise just your standard let's make another buck effort. Just the tape in a different format. Dissappointing."
3,The legendary dinosaur movie :),"Almost everyone knows Jurassic Park. In my opinion, one of the best ILM productions. The special effects are fantastic, and the nature scenes just draw you into the movie. Unfortunately the storie is a bit simple, the idea is OK, but the storie could have been better.The Lost World is a classic ""2"". More evil dinosaurs, more rain, more darkness, and more people being frightened by the dinosaurs. The effects are still OK, but eventhough the effects in Jurassic Park might be older, they are better suited to the movie than in The Lost World, which is just a basic action/2nd-version movie."
5,Two classics for the new millenium,"Bringing these classics to DVD was a breath of relief for Speilberg fans. The movie that paved the way for today's blockbusters is beautifully transferred to the rich, sharp picture of DVD. Bringing these larger than life dinos into your home and surrounding you with the clear, earth-shattering sounds of the past, is a must for any DVD collector."
5,GO JP!,"A *MUST* for any hard-core JP fan - the extras are worth it. Deleted scenes which help explain some plot holes in JP2 were what caused me to buy it in the first place and I must say, it was totally worth it! I highly suggest purchasing this!"
3,Films lose edge on repeat viewing,"Well, JP and LW:JP both deserve a good DVD treatment. Unfortunately, they're Universal properties, so the best they got was ""pretty good."" But that's okay, because the original JP was not as good as I remembered it. I haven't seen it in like 6 years, and since the dinosaurs no longer impress me so much, I was able to focus on the (weak) plot.LW:JP was actually better this time, though still only ""pretty good."" The DVD transfers for both films are nice, though the sound seems to fluctuate when the dinos roar or things get demolished. The extras on JP are actually neat. Unfortunately, some of them (like the ""Dino Dictionary"") were simply recycled and repressed for LW:JP. Come on Universal, put some effort into it!Oh, and the ""special JP3 Trailer"" stinks. A few flashes of lightning, some pictures of a rainy island, and off-camera dinosaur roars, followed by an UGLY new logo. Ugh."
3,My favorite - at last - but Universal can do better,"I have looked forward to these two DVD's. Though dino's don't impress me that much more I can still recall some magic from the first time in the cinema. After watching the two films, struggling with the sound and captions, I have the feeling that they have been transferred directly from VHS master to DVD without any improvement on the sounds. Speak drowns in noise as they did on VHS and I almost lost my temper when we turned the subtitles on. The captions were scattered all over the screen....Furthermore I found some of the extra's recycled on the two discs and especially the teaser for JP3 is a ridiculous joke. The Making Of on both DVD's are pretty interesting, but they can't make me to add the fourth star this time. On the other side, nobody promised us something special with these discs, so if you are even a small dino fan then go on and get the stuff."
4,Jurasic Park,"Some movies you love and then there are the ones you wonder what you were watching before. When I saw this movie I was blown away by the special effects which put a whole new bench mark on effects. Although its getting dated it still can amaze me even though it has been transfered to the small screen. This is a must see for dinosuar freeks out there, and just everyone else who wants to see a lawyer be eaten by a T-Rex."
4,Pretty Good,"Both movies stir the imagination but the second one lacks the originally of the first. It was a pity almost none of the original actors in the first one, didn't come back for a second go."
3,This is what we have been waiting for....,"Even though the Jurassic Park series of films has been around for over 4 years, we have yet to see a release on DVD - till now that is. The pre release has been announced, this double set should be enough to satisfy any fans hunger.Regarding the films themselves they are both special effects feasts, although sorely lacking in storyline. The first film was revolutionary when it came out, it was one of the first flicks to make amazing use of computer graphics to create realistic looking dinosaurs. It also contains occasional moments of scare, a great family film to watch with the kids.But with the second film it had all been seen before, when it comes to special effects anyway. No storyline, and it was hardly scary. A poor film. I think Mr Spielsberg should go back to the drawing board, and figure out a decent plot before he even considers releasing another film to complete the trilogy."
5,Two in one!,"We all loved the Jurassic Park saga and I know most of us are highly anticipating the DVD release! Even better, they've put them both in a package deal for us to save space! Can't WAIT!"
4,What was there was good,"Well I can say that The Lost World was good, but that's all I can say, because the Jurassic Park disc was MISSING."
3,NO DTS - Any collector's edition should have DTS and,I have been waiting for this release since I saw the movies at the theater. I have both movies in VHS format and was really looking forward to the high quality of the collector's edition of these films. I am very disappointed that the option of widescreen or standard is not offered. I am even more disappointed (offended) that these DVDs do not offer DTS sound when the same releases in the stores (not the collector's edition) have it. Thus the low rating.
2,Good Effects,"The effects in these movies are great, but if you have read the books don't watch the movies because as usual hollywood ruins it on the big screen. Sometimes I wonder way Crieghton lets hollywood destroy his books. The only reason to watch these films is to see the amazing effects, everything else can be skipped."
3,NO EXTRAS!!!,THERE WERE NO PREVIEWS OF JURRASIC PARK III. JUST A TEASER WITH NO DINOS IN SIGHT. JUST SOUNDS OF THEM. WAIT UNTIL THE EXTRAS ARE BETTER BEFORE GETTING THESE MOVIES ON DVD. YOU KNOW THEY'LL COME OUT WITH A SPECIAL EDITION WITH REAL EXTRAS.
1,Does not fit the S&W model 908,"This is the second grip I bought. I figured the first was deformed or was an anomaly.In either case, there's no way on earth this grip was designed to fit the model 908.Don't waste your money."
5,Fine grips,They are easy to instal and are much less slippery then originals when wet. Fit my hand better than originals.
3,Underwhelmed,"STAIRS is like a one-joke show. You open ten spreads of whitish paper out of which pop up stair configurations that are especially neat when side-light is allowed to emphasize the shadow pattern. Elaborately bound and boxed, it seems more like a promotional gimmick for Jansma's archtecural firm than a true pop-up book. Compared to a fascinating pop-up like Carter and Diaz's THE ELEMENTS OF POP-UP, or the work of Robert Sabuda, the pop-up collector may find STAIRS a little - well - pale."
1,What happened?,"This new cd from John is not as good as Arkangel. It's like he's tryng more with pop. Arkangel was brilliant. It was also a pop album, but well structured and with better sound and deeper. Sinister forgot everything. I'll try to give it back from where i bought it!."
2,Not even sinister.....,"1.5 star actually.I've lost connection with Wetton's music since the second UK release. I saw that there are so many well known guests on this CD so I decided to pick it up. Jim Vallance, John Mitchell, Robert Fripp, Jim Peterik, Martin Orford, Tod Sucherman, Ian McDonald, Dick Wagner, Greg Bisonette, Steve Christey, Gary Chandler, Guy Roche, Ron Komie and Steve Hackett and Wetton himself. You have to admit that's quite an impressive list of guests (even if I don't recognize half of them).But, well, this recording was for me a very unpleasant surprise. This is pop-rock. I would have nothing against it if the quality of the composition were good. But there is only one tune that saves this album from complete disaster. The beautiful E-SCAPE, played by MacDonald, Wetton and Fripp. The rest of the album means nothing to me and it not even sinister as the title would suggest you."
4,Thought provoking,Farber takes the first amendment and in an easy to understand fashion explains how the Supreme Court interprets laws regarding our free speech as American Citizens.
5,Crystal ladder,Perfect!!! This item is exactly what I wanted. Will be using it for a wedding cake for my friends daughter.
3,An Introduction to the First Beat,"This Kerouac book is only for his fans who want to know more about Jack's past or religion. ""On the Road"" readers will miss the motion of that novel, instead find the sentimental side of Jack as he tells the story of, perhaps, the first Beat, he-who-was-most-gone, Gerard"
4,A hit,"Kerouac is often hit or miss. This book is a double bull. Its sad, beautiful... The affect that his older brother's young death had on Jack is moving. If you've been discouraged by Kerouac in the past, or if you think he's overated (I tend to agree) try this book out."
5,Great swing for dancers !,"I've heard this band live this summer at the Polk Street Swing Festival (San Francisco). Really a surprise, comming up with a lot of tunes for swingdancers. If you want some music for swingdancing or you just want to listen to some swinging tunes, you have to buy this CD."
1,Magix MP3 Player,"Is there a ""zero star"" rating? Clearly not worth the money. MP3 Maker comes with two compression algorithms. One compresses into mp3 format faster than the other. The catch is you have to pay Magix an extra $9.95usd to be able to use it. Aside from the fact that this application is a resource hog, getting assistance from Magix with any problems is less likely than winning the PowerBall lottery. After many ill-fated attempts to correct flaky problems I have found some freeware/shareware packages that work great. Magix support is non-existent. One can spend the money on a toll-call to leave a message or send an e-mail. Either way, you will never get an answered back from Magix. Bottom line, don't waste your money on this product."
4,Good isolation,"Very good on planes, isolates background noise very well. Overall sound quality good, but somewhat overly bassy, depending on the source of course. Comfort v.good if you like leather-type super-aural phones. They do slip a bit if you are moving though and they need to be seated just right for the best sound. The cord is very long.These are great if you are going to be sitting still and need high quality sound in a small package and have a lot of ambient noise around."
2,Undue Profanity,"This could have been a cute movie for kids; I have a grandson the same age at Tim, and he wears the same style of glasses so I thought it would be perfect for him to see a little hero just like himself. Then, Tim starts lying, and even gets his grandfather to lie for him. But even more, I questioned if I should show it to him (and his older brother) because of the frequent profanity. The matter was settled when little Tim started swearing. I will not show it to them. This is one movie NOT to show your kids or grandchildren unless you want them to use profanity or become proficient liars. It's too bad . . . it could have been a nice, wholesome family movie."
2,Disappointing with no real action,This movie should only be seen on tv and is not worth spending the money. Even the grandkids were disappointed.
3,"Camera case is Awesome, but.....",The battery case which is also awesome on its own has one drawback. It separates easily from the the camera case. The little snap that holds the battery case to the camera case comes on done very easily. I ended up loosing the battery case and a $59 dollar Panasonic Lumix Battery as a result of the poor functionality of the snap. Beware if you attach the camera case to your belt with the battery case also attached to it.
4,Case for Panasonic TZ3 digital camera,"The case is beautiful. However, there needs to be a place for an additional card & I would like it to have a strap which can go around the neck. I don't wear a belt usually for the belt loop attachment."
1,What you see is not what you get,The photo in the ad is not what I received in the mail. I ordered this item twice and both time received a camera case that is too small to hold a Panasonic Lumix ZS3. I received a camera case that is a vertical closure rather than the pictured horizontal closure and about 3/4 of the size of a zs3.
1,Shipped wrong item,The pictured product is what I ordered. What I received was a case for a different camera. one star is for Amazon shipping the wrong product. I never did get the right case. (:-(
4,A LANDMARK BOOK- Except...,"Peele's book, as well as Ragge's book are great- they debunk much of the nonsense rampant in the 12 Step psychosis that grips much of America.My problem though is that they don't go far enough and call a spade a spade. Namely, how much of what we call addiction is really just the ol' placebo effect coupled with behavorial indoctrination? (The indoctrinees into the ""spiritual disease"" theory are exhibit A.)"
1,Not the truth,This guy is stupid and crazy and has no idea what he is talking about. Not one person I have ever met in this field agrees with this idiot or any of his books. Nothing he claims has ever been proven and nobody outside of his book has ever stepped foward to agree with his methods or opinions on addiction. He really needs some sort of treatment himself. Dave.
1,"Low Quality DVD, but Excellent Docmentary","This is NOT an official BBC DVD, but appears to be a low quality MPEG4 conversion. The source is probably the Internet Archives. Don't waste your money on this DVD: simply download the same quality MPEG4 version fromhttp://www.archive.org/details/ThePowerOfNightmaresAnd, while you're at it, download Adam Curtis's other excellent documentary, ""The Century of the Self."" (Don't bother buying the DVD available here at Amazon, mistitled ""Century of Self"" - again, another MPEG4 to DVD conversion)"
5,Great documentary but........,"most documentaries have a very big problem in that they use way too much background music (noise) that obscures what is being said. Lots of extraneous noise is not appreciated....especially when one is trying to listen carefully to what is being said (maybe with the volume up) and all of a sudden they blast you with an extremely loud sound as they do in this documentary. I listen using headphones and my ears are still ringing from this. If sub-captions were provided, at least I could have tuned out the noise. Aside from this, the documentary was excellent and told a very important message that we should all know and understand. I must have been pretty lucky as I must have gotten the very last copy..as I now see that Amazon has posted that this documentary is no longer available...hmmm!????I wonder why???"
5,Great stuff! I don't find it fishy...,"This stuff doesn't smell fishy to me at all, not quite sure why most the other reviewers are complaining about that and I have a sensitive nose. It has a slight ocean/beach scent to it but it's not nauseating by any means. I put two servings of this in a large smoothie batch that I make every day for my nearly 3 yr old daughter, my husband and myself. We can't taste it at all, but our smoothies are loaded with many other veggies and fruits so I wouldn't expect to taste it anyways.I do have to say to other reviewers, what did you expect it's kelp powder it clearly wasn't going to taste like pineapple."
2,kelp powder,it is not good. after opening the box it gives lot of bad smell looks like some died animals inside. i have already used kelp powder with different company that does not have this bad smell. that was very good.thanks.
3,"Settle down, Mario","If you like watching Mario on his TV programs, you'll be dissapointed in some aspects of this book. The cuisine is as presented in his restaurant, where he has staff to do all kinds of additional prep for him. Consequently, the dishes are way overwrought for the home kitchen. Braised short ribs? Great! With roasted beets and roasted radishes? Why? And by the way, the recommended plating is still all that vertical, ""Let's see how high we can pile THIS stuff up,"" kind of thing. And a lot of the book is frank promotion for Babbo and his ideas on how to run a restaurant. But nevertheless, it's fun stuff to read and, if you ignore the absurd sides, there's good stuff to be made."
3,"It's a pretty book, but not much use for the home cook","I really like Batali's other cookbooks. Unfortunately this one, while laid out well, doesn't have much the home cook could (or would want to) cook. Most of the recepies are complex and time consuming and just don't taste as good as the stuff from ""Molto Italiano."" Buy his other books to cook with. Buy this one if you eat in Babo a lot and want to know how he does it."
4,"Labor-intensive recipes, with stunning results","Love him or hate him, Molto Mario's more than just a Food Network pretty boy. Unlike a lot of so-called ""star chefs"", he actually puts his money where his mouth is. In a city full of fabulous restaurants, Babbo's known as a no-compromises joint -- and this cookbook will help you recreate many of the restaurant's signature dishes. Set aside an afternoon for prep (and maybe a morning for shopping, while you're at it), and you'll be cooking up dishes that will make your Nonna weep with happiness."
5,Purchased for charity auction,"This was auctioned off at Emeril's big annual charity dinner, Mario was a guest chef there too!! Auction lot included 20 specialty chef cookbooks."
2,not very good,"I know Batali has become an American icon for Italian cooking, but this book is poorly written and assembled. It is boring to thumb through with recipies that invite you to close the book and go to another.I love Italy and both Northern and Southern cuisine, but this just doesn't work for me."
3,A maybe,"I had great hopes for Babbo after watching Batali on the food channel. I give it the Simon Cowell 'it is just ok'. The book has some interesting tidbits preceding each recipe, making you want to read on. But there never was that 'aha' moment. The veal and pork ragu was, again, just ok and the pumpkin orzo was inedible, way to sweet from the honey.I really wanted to like this book, so I combed over the recipes again a couple of times and gave up. I think his earlier book 'Mario Batali' is a better choice."
2,No Hook,I am the kind of reader that has to be captured in the first few pages. I put this book aside after a few pages because it had no hook to keep me reading. I have read two other books in the mean time and I may or may not try to read this one again.
1,No thanks,Didn't like where the story was going. Not my type of plot or tense of writing . Just couldn't stay interested
4,Good detective novel,"I purchased this book for my kindle because I enjoy reading detective novels. Through the preview on Amazon.com I was able to read the first few pages and it seemed like something I would be interested in reading further. The writing was smooth and the plot moved along at a good pace. There were tons of twists and turns which I like when reading mysteries. Collins use of real people and places in Hawaii, mixed with his characters made the book seem more real. Overall it was a good read."
3,Hard to get into,"This book reads like a Sam Spade mystery. Very 1940's. Initially it was hard to keep track of who's who, but once you get into it you have to see how it ends. An interesting story. Good representation of that era."
2,To easy,Did not keep my interest from the beginning--I mut admit I did not read more than a few pages so perhaps my opinion doesn't count. I bought it for some light reading but wasn't too my taste.
3,Not too intriguing,"It's ok, it just does not keep my interest going. I am in the middle of it but I could stop now."
5,damned in Paradise,Heller weaves history and suspense together while using famous personages as participants in the story.You'll find a young Buster Crabbe in Hawaii as well as the real Charlie Chan (pseudonym). Fun read. I find all of his books well researched.
5,Never Disappoints!,"I love the Nathan Heller detective novels. They are light reading but witty, well-written and historically interesting. And great fun!"
4,Great budget tripod,"This tripod is great for anyone on a budget. Its construction, while not overly impressive, gives the sense that it won't tip over. Beyond that, it does what it's meant to do -- holds a camera steady and allows you as the photographer to make adjustments easily and with precision. The built-in level helps get things straight, while the adjustment knobs are easy to learn and work well for quick adjustments. I really can't ask for anything more for the price.Simply put, if you don't want to spend over $100 on a tripod, this is the one to get."
1,Useless after a piece broke off,I only used this tripod a few times and one of the latches that lets you adjust the legs broke. Without the ability to level and adjust the height the tripod is worthless.
2,Quick Release Mount Ineffective,"I had an old slik tripod that I loved. So to stay with the brand loyalty - I chose this model. The quick release mount works only if you shoot in a horizontal position, the second you flip it to vertical - the screw loosens and the camera flops over. The screw won't wont stay tight enough to hold the camera steady."
4,A lovely pre-school counting book,"A perfect first counting book that could be used with even a 1 year old. The book introduces various farm animals and their babies,from 2 calves to 10 baby rabbits as Elizabeth Hen proudly tells them about the egg she has laid. At the end of course, her egg hatches into one chick and ""Elizabeth Hen was as proud as could be."" The illustrations are appealing pastel watercolors."
5,BACK IN 20 - Worth The Wait !!,"A great CD by the ledgendary US Bonds. Catches the energy as felt in the live shows and is a definite show case for his party sounds, now with a touch of the blues. Get this CD and see him the next time he's in town."
5,Great comeback album,"It has been 20 years since Bonds' last comeback, care of Bruce Springsteen and company. The Boss is here again and the songwriting, most of it by Bonds, is first-rate. Blues, rock and R&B come together on a great album."
3,The drill bits wobble with quick changer,"The kit has a well balanced assortment of drill/driver bits and nut setters, quick changer and screw guide. The content is convenient to use. The quick changer is a good idea, but my testing showed it works well for driver bits, but not drill bits. The driver bits wobbled significantly when used with the quick changer. Therefore only 3 stars."
3,quick release doesn't fit my skil drill,"This product was ""paired"" with the SKIL 2364-02 7.2-Volt Lithium-Ion Drill/Driver that I ordered. However, the ""quick release"" piece will not fit this drill. It is just a hint too big. Needless to say I was a bit disappointed. All the drill bits fit fine though."
4,Overlooked and Underrated,"I actually have this one on cassette...At War was one of those bands who got lost in the speed metal shuffle, but if you like Celtic Frost and Venom then you will really dig this band. They had that ""bassy"" sound to them and, in my opinion, were one of the most overlooked and underrated bands from the 80s speed metal movement. Do yourself a favor and go back to school with At War!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"First of all these sheets arrived extremely late, 4 wks late.They felt great. But by morning the top sheet is falling a part. I sent them back and they were suppose to send me another set. A month later I cancelled my order. The company is very helpful and kept me posted on what was going on."
4,Extremely interesting,I'm not sure why the previous two reviewers asked whether the author had ever been to Iraq - if they'd taken the time to read the preface they'd see that MacKey HAS been to the country. I found the book thorough and interesting and an excellent starting point for people who are unfamiliar with the topic. Also a useful contribution to the debate on what to do next that gets around the simple hawks and doves approach.
5,The Reckoning,"I had read Sandra Mackey's book, ""The Saudis"" a couple of years ago and found it fascinating and insightfully true. I saw her on C-SPAN talking about this new book, ""The Reckoning"", and I knew I had to buy it. Waldenbooks let me buy their ""store copy"" which came in a couple of days earlier than the normal shipment. I read all night long. This book is more historical and concentrates on the early history of the Arab world. I thank Ms. (Professor?) Mackey for researching everything so deeply for those of us who have a very difficult time understanding why or how some peoples of the world behave as they do. I also found many of her observations to be so true. I'm holding on to my copies. Please try to read these books for yourselves and reflect upon how we are all human beings with very unique perspectives on life."
2,Disappointing,"I have a great interest in Iraq and buy every new book published about the ruler and the country. Therefore I rushed to buy this book. I was disappointed because I discovered no new information in this book. I felt the author had read everything published about Saddam Hussein and simply rehashed all the information. This method of writing does not impress me. What I would like to know is this: Has the author ever traveled to Iraq? If so, when? Has the author met with Saddam Hussein? If so, when? Although it is not easy to travel in that part of the world, I do know people who have traveled there for humanitarian reasons. I would think a truly serious author would travel to any country they were writing about.I say this book is okay but nothing special. If I had bothered to read a few pages in the store before buying it, I would not have bothered. So my recommendation is ""two thumbs down,"" to this latest work of Ms. Mackey."
3,Decent background,"Mackey does a good job drawing some of the historical background of Iraq. However, she gets a bit too emotional and political in her analysis of Gulf War I and II. A bit more balance and rationality would have sustained the book's credibility, which wanes toward the end."
5,All I Can Absorb About Iraq,"I thought The Reckoning was absolutely splendid. I feel that I know more than I ever thought I wanted to know and enjoyed it thoroughly. Congratulations to Sandra Mackey for an outstanding book.Now when I read the paper or watch the news, I feel rather like an expert!"
3,Some surprising information,"I'd also say this book is a good introduction.I was surprised to read in it that Great Britainhad dropped poison gas on the Kurds first,in 1920, during a general uprising againsttheir mandate. I don't often hear thismentioned in the West but I'll bet it'sstill talked about in the Middle East."
3,Fun book,"It was a fun book. I mainly got it to research up two numbers that kept on ""following"" me around. After that, i havent looked at the book. It's nice to know what the meaning of the numbers on your house is.. and your cell phone."
5,Awesome,"Whenever I get numbers that seem to come to me or am drawn to a number, I run and pull out this book. Everytime it's message has been exactly what I needed. No negative comments here."
5,Numbers explained,"I love this book. I always wondered what numbers meant. I always thought they meant something. I wanted messages from my angels and when I read this book the messages were clear and I had no idea that math was so logical.Examples of clear messages: 213-Have faith in your intuition. You are receiving messages from ascended masters especially goddesses. Note note of your feelings and act on them.214 Have faith in your ideas and surrender fears to the angels. Your wishes/desires are possible.674-The angels support the steps you have taken in the matter and want you to know you're on the right track.Doreen Virtue explains the history of numbers and how spirituality was woven even way back when... If you want angel guidance daily, try this book. The numbers are scarily accurate. I keep this in the car and feel connected. I have introduced my guidance seeking clients to this book and they love it, just as much as I do!"
5,The book that saved my life,"I have used this book heavily since March 2006, when I underwent what I consider one of the toughest karmic tests in my whole life (and I can tell you that I have experienced quite a few!).Since then, I go through life reading numbers and the Angels talk to me continuously through the vibration of such. I have become quite a ""conosseur"" and can pick up messages very fast. This is a pocket book I take with me everywhere. After all, I wouldn't want to miss an important message, whenever or wherever the heavens are ready to contact me!"
5,Finally!,"Having seen 3-4 digits that are the same (such as 444) for many years led me to search for the meaning. That was my introduction to Doreen Virtue, my favorite author. After reading Doreen's book, ""Healing with the Angels"", I found my answers. Now, with the Angel Numbers book, I can find more answers that lead to an even better understanding of what's going on in my life and can make positive changes. Seems like every time I purchase either book, I end up giving it away!"
4,Simple,Great! Just thought it may also have more to read about the science of angel coding. Still very helpful especially for busy people like myself!
4,Excellent Tool,"I have owned this book for several years and I find it to be quite helpful with understanding messages being communicated by my Guardian Angels and other Light Beings who assist with my life.One thing I have noticed, if I see a recurring letter or license plate letters or words ... if I convert the letters to their numeric value I can decipher the messages that are unclear or confusing.So there another way to use this book our author did not think/know of."
5,Don't Leave Home Without IT!,"I Love Doreen Virtue's work!! I'm also into recycling - the book was good & 'broken-in' to perfection!! I don't leave home w/out this book in my reach!! GREAT messages from Spirit & Angels!! God Bless everyone in ways they can readily see & touch!!Hilda Miles, RN"
1,Terrible product!!!!,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas and the quick change attachment broke the first time he used it. The drill bits have pretty much all broken, too. This kit is poorly made and terrible quality. Save your money. It's only getting 1 star from me because there is no option for zero stars!"
4,Nice looking pegs,"These pegs are great. I suggest looking at them in a store prior to buying. I thought large meant long, but I think it actually refers to the diameter of the pegs. The only problem I have with them is the rubber grips seem to be a little loose and I cant seem to tighten them up. Not a safety issue."
3,Amazon's right - The back cover is wrong,"To my surprise, when I got the set I found the back cover says ""3 Disc Set - 6 Films!"" Luckily after opening the set and checking the FOUR discs included, I found that Amazon's listing above is correct. The set does include those 7 movies, along with an English version of ""Don't Panic"" as well as the Spanish version. The back cover also only lists 6 movies, leaving off 'Demon Rat', but it is there on disc 3. So, 8 movies on 4 discs, not 6 on 3. Kind of sloppy on BCI's part but, it all works out."
3,Soccer for Kids DVD,"Your 4 or 5 year old would probably love this movie. I have 5 kids with their ages ranging from 4-10. My 4 year old liked it, but the others noticed how the lips of the person talking didn't line up with the words being said. Also, the video itself was not the best quality. It did cover basic soccer skills that a very young child might enjoy seeing."
2,Painful to watch,"My 6-year-old son, who had minimal knowledge of soccer at the time, found this DVD to be extremely basic, slow-paced, and (in his word) ""babyish.""I forced myself to sit through it with him, and tried to seem interested and enthusiastic, but it didn't work. If your kids are still on level with Dora the Explorer, this might fly... Otherwise, give it a pass (so to speak)."
3,Wish it were better,The intro is way too long although the video itself is too short. The time would've been better spent getting down to brass tacks about soccer techniques.
1,When Talking Isn't Enough,"Mike Feder's memoir, The Talking Cure, tells about his sad, painful childhood and his desperate efforts to cheer his manic depressive mother. It also tells about his funny adventures working in a radio station. I enjoyed reading these chapters. I enjoyed less those chapters that describe his experience as a husband and father. He describes, for example, how he fathered children unwillingly -- because his wife was so eager to have them. In this section, his tone is self-righteous and somewhat vindictive. I wondered how Mr. Feder could have experienced such little personal freedom in his relationships after he'd had over fifteen years of psychotherapy. Sometimes, I suppose, talking is not enough. To his credit, Mr. Feder has had the good fortune to find women who have loved him -- no matter what."
1,Will talking ever cure this?,"I just finished The Talking Cure, and I don't recommend it. After almost 40 years of psychotherapy (talking), Feder is remarkably unreflective about his own failures as a father and husband. After talking to over ten shrinks, he still seems to feel his two previous marriages failed because his ex-wifes expected too much, didn't understand his artistic, selfish nature, and wanted children. Please! Is this fiction or what? Feder's narrative is moderately interesting when he describes his crazy mother and his crazy radio station, but it definitely bogs down when he describes his disturbed married and family life. The characters are flat, cartoonish. For example, there's the bitchy wife who doesn't understand him, and then there's Feder, his own long suffering, maligned hero. You wonder why so much talking to shrinks didn't result in greater reflection and sorrow about the damage Feder has done to his family and the people who love him. Maybe talking isn't for everyone?"
5,Never In A Hurry:Essays on people and places,"If you care more than casually about the people in this world and you care, or might even be persnickety about good, clean, involved writing, you will like this book.This is the fifth Nye authored book I have read.Tip for Never In A Hurry? Start with Favorite Cleaners, San Antonio.Best sentence, my opinion?From;One Village:""They are poor, shy kids dressed in dust and forty colors.""No surprise. Naomi Shihab Nye is a poet. It is enriching to find the many glints of poetry done well in this book.Something like a treasure hunt.F.S. Lentz"
4,"Wonderful descriptions, but too wordy for use on the trail","This book covers most of the important hiking areas in Los Angeles County. There isn't room in the book for every hike at each of these areas (partly due to the long descriptions of the hikes which are in the book) but the author covers a good variety at each site, including most of the best hikes.The descriptions of the hikes are wonderful (such as the mention of the ""Darth Vader house"" at Solstice Canyon) but are a bit too wordy to follow while on the trail.You will definitely need a separate map, as the maps in this book are too small and lack necessary detail. For many of the shorter hikes in the Santa Monica Mountains or Griffith Park you can find nice maps in the book Day Hikes Around Los Angeles, which makes a nice companion to this book. For longer hikes, get a good topographical map. (Watch out, some of the USGS maps of the LA area are pretty bad, including many of the maps of the Santa Monica mountains.)"
4,"Great book, but becoming outdated","This book has been indispensable for my hiking here ever since I bought this book, and I'd recommend it to anyone.However, as these trails change, the book is becoming a bit outdated. New housing developments, newly placed security fences, washed out paths, etc are starting to become apparent as I try new trails each week."
2,Better books out there,I am an avid SoCal hiker and have been attempting to use this book for the past 6 months or so. I would agree with others on its over-wordiness - especially since much of the space taken up by those words could have ben used for better directions! I really find this author to be terrible at them. Please please please don't ever leave me stranded or lost anywhere with only this book to help me find my way out. Try the Falcon Guides or Moon selections for much better maps and directions.
3,Many Old Favorites and Some New Ideas,"Wonderful projects with great tips. Although some of these were quite unique such as grass dolls, nature pictures, and leaf plates, most of the projects I had used ad nauseum. Does have a potpourri of nature facts, tips, and variations to enhance your project.If you need a good resource for ideas for your children or classroom, I recommend a copy. However, if you are experienced with working with kids' crafts and are looking for new ideas, this may not be the book for you.Best used as a quick reference resource with all your favorites in one easy volume instead of notebooks, binders, and such."
1,Poor Quality Software,I had DVD Copy 4 and it worked great. I upgraded to DVD Copy 5 so thaqt I could create high quality iPod videos but have encountered the following issues1) This version always uses the C: Drive for temporary files even if you define a different drive in the configuration2) After converting the file to temporary space on the C: Drive the program churns and churns and ends up Not RepondingI have registered the product online and have reported the problems above three times through Intervideo's online support form and have not received and answer.I would highly recommend not upgrading to DVD Copy 5
1,Program Flawed / Customer Service Stinks,"Downloaded a trial version and it failed to work, so I emailed customer service. (No toll free phone support) A week and a half has went by with no response. Even after continued emails asking for help. Don't waste your time and $ on this one. If they treat a potential customer this poorly, imagine how they will treat you after they have your hard earned $...By the way, look at the reviews for the other products they offer. There are some serious issues that need to be resolved at Intervideo."
4,"A lot of humor, some angst and a good subplot","Another good Roswell book, this one was even better than `Skeletons in The Closet'. The basic plot is that Kyle is having nightmares after Alex's death so Isabel reluctantly dreamwalks him to help sort it out. Then she gets stuck in his dream/head and can't get out. After reading the Roswell High books, I had forgotten how much Kyle changed in the later seasons of the show and how caring he got for his friends. It was a nice side of him to see while he was worrying about Isabel. It also goes into his past and his unhappy family life. Another side of a character we don't get to see as much was Isabel's own worry over Kyle and her helping to get him past the nightmares. A lot of humor, some angst and a good subplot. I liked Michael warming up to the kid in the end, very appropriate."
4,good job,I just love Max and Liz story I wish the series just kept going but oh well - life is not like that
2,Not What I Expected,"I was excited about receiving this book, as my aunt had given me her collection of Swarovski Crystal to sell on eBay for her. I thought it would at least identify all of the pieces in her collection and answer at least most of the questions posed by potential bidders. It did not. At least half of the pieces are not listed in the book, nor does the book answer what I feel are some pretty basic questions posed by bidders. Not a complete waste of money, but had I known in advance, I would have looked for a much more comprehensive book."
4,Great starter for Swarovski collectors,I had previously owned some Swarovski that I had received as gifts and decided I wanted to start actively collect them. I was buying a lot of the older pieces on the second market and wanted to make sure I was getting a fair deal. This book was exactly what I was looking for. It had the details that I needed to make sure I was getting authentic pieces at a fair price. Great for any starter collector.
5,Perfectly balanced Pendulum,This pendulum is so well made. It is well balanced. The weight is evenly distibuted. The cards are nice for a beginner. The book is just an introduction to working with it. I suggest further reading. This is a great gift for anyone who wants to develop their intuition.
1,Unnecessary,This is a waste of money. If you want to know how to use a pendulum well there's really nothin' to it. And there's a wealth of information on it on the internet if you really want to get creative. So the book does nothing for you. In fact it's a little annoying to think of someone trying to charge for information they sure didn't invent. This is an ancient practice after all.The cards you can make yourself (yes they'll work fine if they don't look fancy)and to your own specifications.Which only leaves the pendulum itself. It'd be much cheaper to buy a lightweight plumb bob instead.
1,Model kit fails expectations,We bought this building kit for our grandson for Christmas. As yet (May) he has not been able to build it as it came with no instructions and he can't figure it out. He lives 800 miles away so I cannot offer any assistance. So that means this was a complete bust.
2,UbD Review,"I learned about this product in a professional learning seminar at my school before I ever bought the book. The department head discussed the same concepts in a much more concise manner. The book uses unnecessarily elevated language instead of simply stating the process for implementing backwards design. The text often referred to terms that were only listed in the glossary, and the glossary definitions were presented in jumbled and vague language. The concept and process is only clear to the reader because of the sample handouts in the text. Had I not known about backwards design before reading this book, I would not have implemented the concepts unless required to do so because the process (as explained in the book) contains many more steps than necessary to achieve the desired result."
2,New Backwards design model,"There is really nothing new in this book as far as the design of the model of learning and classroom structure.Is is merely a new way of looking at Backwards design. That being said, if you have no experience working with backwars design, it is interesting to see how it changes your outlook on education."
4,Understanding by Design,"UbD requires time and effort in becoming a ""pro"" with the text. A must for effective curriculum design."
3,UbD review,Okay...not great. The content was constantly repeated. I had to read it for a class. Not something I would have read on my own.
4,Good Textbook,"Be prepared to shift your lesson planning schema!This book takes an entirely new approach to planning lessons and units.It focuses on the big picture with what they call ""enduring understandings.""I highly recommend this for someone who may feel like they are in a teaching rut.I know that this book is commonly being used in schools across the midwest."
5,High Fire Glazes,Excellent book that clearly explains glazing chemistry and use in a well-written format with supportive pictures.
5,First Rate Beautifully Produced,"A MUST HAVE for anyone working at Cone 10. Pictures of the glaze samples are unusually clear and the text by Britt (truly a master potter) is clear, precise and accurate. For what you are getting as a potter, this volume is a steal and a real tweak for the imagination."
5,Pottery,I bought this book at the request of my sister-in-law who is a potter. It was recommended to her by another potter. She loves it.
4,Good Book,Very happy with this purchase. The recipes are all laid out and organized very well. Easy to find what you're looking for and lots of good pictures.
5,Mastering High Fire Glzes,John Britt has done a superb job with sharing his years of experience with successful high fire glazes. John not only provides recipes and pictures of successful glazes but he gives detailed information on how best to fire these glazes. The book is well organized and allows glazes to be found easily. The pictures of glazed pieces and test tiles are of high quality and give accurate representations of the glazes. I recommend this book especially to those of us ceramicists who are working with high fire glazes. Even if you are not working with high fire glazes this book may change your mind . I highly recommend this book.
1,where is it,i am very upset i have not received it yet ? where is it ?please send it ! first time i have had this problem !
5,Great bread knife,A very good bread knife for slicing; inexpensive and very efficient. Recommend this even above the more expensive bread knives.
2,Over-hyped and not recommended,"Honestly, I don't know what people see in this knife. My regular chef's knife is better by far. Perhaps this knife is good for wonderbread-type sandwiches, but it takes real effort to slice through crusty bread. I'm sorry I spent the money."
5,"Good knife, good price","Picked this up on a recommendation from Anthony Bourdain. It's a good, useful, all-around serrated kitchen tool, and the offset handle is cool."
2,Not What It Appeared to Be,"I was very anxious to solve my property management problems with QuickBooks, and was taken by the title. Unfortunately, I didn't notice in the description that this is a 99-pg. spiral bound book. And it costs over $40! It is very basic, fairly elementary, and does not give extensive information with various scenarios as one might expect from a real BOOK! Additionally, in skimming the book today, I notice that the proofreader wasn't up to the job.This guide is OK for a beginner, but it's more a ""Quick Start"" guide than anything else."
4,Perfect for beginners,This gives you basic 'quick start' guide immediately! Perfect for beginners (for both quickbooks and property management). Easy to understand and you can easily get used to managing your property accounts through Quickbooks software. Not like other overwhelming computer software manuals or boring real estate account instructions.
5,Thighs of Steel,"I love all of Tammi Lee Webbs tapes. This one was not ADVANCED, I have all of those and should have realized its too easy for me. Great for most folks, however. She is the best!"
4,s,ya its good a lot to do on it still gettting my head around it thou asked for techno 5 but received 4 instead but it will have to do
5,Search Resolved,"I have been looking for material on Ms wheatley since I was in elementary school when I read a story about her. I still don't have that story, no idea who wrote it but if anybody knows the book I mean, please let me know. All material in great condition, shipped promptly.VV"
3,Unfortunate Silence,"While I enjoyed Lucas' portrayal of SS training and military conquests, he intentionally leaves out definitive aspects of this divisions history. While the reader is enlightened with every imaginable detail of triumph and bravery, he is silent on ""The Malmedy Massacre"" as well as any other atrocity this force undertook. A short paragraph entails that ""all divisions, no matter what their origin, undertook atrocities, and I shall not mention them here."" Makes one question the validity of this book, and scoff at the apparent propaganda contained within. I wouldn't recommend this unless you have a thorough understanding of this portion of history, as it will intentionally paint a biased picture concerning ""Das Reich."""
3,OK,"I picked up this book after reading Steel Inferno, which was pretty good, and was somewhat dissappointed. The maps in this book are terrible. If your looking for an in depth study of tactics and the battles fought by the SS, this book is not for you. However if you like reading personal accounts with unit history mixed in it, you would probably like this book. The author, however, is very selective in his choice of personal accounts. All of them make the SS look like a very nice and sometimes victimized organization. On the whole it was somewhat entertaining."
2,History without context,"I have recently finished this book, and I must echo the others in their criticism of its inability to answer any difficult questions. I was also put off by spelling mistakes, poor grammar, and bad maps. (The incessant use of ""gain touch"" when ""gain contact"" was the intended words were especially irritating.) It succeeded in its goal of being a history of the ""Military Role"" of 'Das Reich,' but I found it was just that - a chronological order of some of the engagements 'Das Reich' fought in. History without context to the greater conflict surrounding the division.--Mike"
3,The MILITARY role,"I purchased this book because it advertised itself as being 'The Military Role' of the 2ND SS division. I was not disappointed, it outlined the military role of the Das Reich division, its beginning and its end. The Pros: the personal accounts and letters. The Cons: a bit dry and hard to read at times. True to its subtitle it avoided the non-military aspects. While it was not one of the best books I have read I did not regret purchasing it.This book is recommended for the casual reader of WWII history who is interested in the military role of the 2nd SS division and how it was formed. If you have done extensive WWII reading a book similar to Hubert Meyer's history on the 12 SS is recommended as Lucas' book is geared more for a beginner in my humble opinion."
3,bargain,The little book from Luckas covers a hell of a lot of ground for its size. Helps flesh out the battles for Kharkov a little more than you find usually. Extra points for being hard cover.
5,Superb!,"If you've read my other reviews of Deborah Martin's music, then it's a ditto for this album. So, so very rich and sonorous. Love it!"
5,video tripod that feels like a more expensive model,"after looking for days and reading customer reviews on many well known sites,I found this model.I own 2 promaster tripods that are not the design I was looking for when I bought them,but I had to settle for them back then.it's heavy enough to hold a camcorder and a video light on top.It's smooth and dont' jerk like my other 2.Plus the handle is not the type that locks the up and down motion.(I hate those,it caused the camcorder to drop downward when I forgot to lock the handle).A model like this cost more than $200,and I'm happy with this model.Is doesn't feel cheap,does not look cheap.I don't like skinny legs on a tripod or to be lightweight.Like somebody said:if you are going to use a tripod a lot,better find a good one."
5,Happy with this product,"This tripod feels and looks like quality. It is slightly on the heavy side to act as a travel tripod but it needs to be to provide the stability that it does. At first it appeared slightly long to fit into my High Sierra 22 inch carry-on bag which I like to take on plane trips to avoid long waits for checked-in baggage. But I found that if I remove the rubber stopper (it is designed to be removable) and take out the center column completely, I can fit the the tripod into the bag on the diagonal. I was very happy to discover this. A happy purchase."
4,Emperors Rule,"the best of the series in my opinion, tying in nicely with the first and last book and giving a ripping good story."
3,All rite,"This whistle sound is ok, not consistent as I would like , sometimes has funny sound when blowing but most r ok."
4,Finger Grip whistle,"Exactly what I needed. Strong breath is required to make a good sound, but it will get every player's attention. I referee quidditch games and this can stop play in its tracks. The finger grip isnt very customizable, but it fits well on my index and middle finger.I recommend this whistle highly"
3,Fox 40,I am a football referee and wanted to try a finger whistle. I knew that fox 40's are a quality whistle. I've used them for years. I am pleased with the whistle but the finger grip is a little tight. I am a large man with big hands and it does't fit comfortabley. Other than that it works very well.
5,enormously comforting and hope-inspiring,"I read this book as a very dear friend was dying. While I still felt great sadness at the loss, I no longer felt any fear for her- I just knew my wonderful friend Grace was in a place/state of all-encompassing love. The cross-cultural reseach was very readable and astonishing at times, and the anecdotes were terrific and powerful (especially the ""red shoe on the roof"" story.) The lessons learned that these people ""brought back"" stuck with me... a powerful book"
5,Just lost my Mother,"I just lost my Mother, and read this book. She was a friend of Mally Cox-Chapman, and had this book for years, but I never read it until I lost her, and it was such a comfort. It corroborated many stories I've heard over the years, but best of all looks at the NDE from an unbiased perspective and covers many ranges of cultures and beliefs. I felt after reading it there is true evidence that there is a loving, comforting world waiting for us beyond the physical one we're in now, regardless of your ubpringing or current beliefs."
5,Telegrams of love,"This book was very comforting to read. It is thoroughly researched and yet the writing style makes it feel like a friend is talking to you. Cox-Chapman believes that near-death experiences are telegrams of love and reassurance, and she is very persuasive in bringing that message to her audience."
4,Possibly Wrong Movie by Amazon.com,"""Chameleon"" with Anthony LaPaglia and Kevin Pollak came out in 1995. This title shows Chameleon (2000). Make sure you are ordering the correct movie, regardless of the reference to the name Anthony LaPaglia in this title's review listing."
3,Another View of History,"Well, it's Irving. However, his Nazi bias seems to be on a short leash this time out. Most of the time this is a reasonable history of the trials. Could this be an attempt to become an actual historian? Irving hauls a lot of baggage with him, but he does keep his facts straight in this book and doesn't twist them, then blitz the reader with footnotes to cover his tracks. Refreshing."
3,Not Bad,"Irving is certainly not the""foremost historian of WWII"", but compared to his usual Nazi apologetics, this book is not bad. There are better, more scholarly books on Nuremberg and this book is weakened by bias, yet it remains an interesting perspective."
4,Great collection,"Great collection of Yoruba proverbs which are organized thematically, and also include literal and subjective translations into english. Buy two copies, everyone will want to borrow it."
3,Way too Opinionated,"Hard to believe these two guys spent so much time in Florida without discovering what a sandspur really is. (They refer to ""sandspur lots"" as lots with sand and spurs. The sandspur is a common weed, well-documented in Florida.) But this doesn't seem to be the book's only shortcoming. Evidently the authors' idea of a good beach is a spring-break spot, fresh with wet T-shirts and tequila shooters. That's okay for some, but there are Floridians who find other things about the beach compelling."
4,USSR used Wall Street to give money for Hitler.,"I read this book here in Brazil.It is available free on internet.This book has many chapters talking about the money pumped by famous americans, to Hitler's gang.Good work, but this book didn't showed you openly, that the same banks and companies, who gave money to Hitler, also gave money to Lenin or were big USSR's costumers before.To example, Ford Motor Company gave money to Hitler, but this happened after big business between USSR and Ford Motor Company.In fact, before Hitler took power, in 1933, if didn't gave money to Hitler's gang , you couldn't be a great USSR's costumer."
4,Rotten Business,"When I served in the ccupation of Germany in the early fifties, I wondered why the massive building housing The V Corps of the US Army was such a prominent feature of Frankfurt. I soon discovered it to be the former I G Farben headquarters, apparently untouched by our bombing while all around, there was still the debris of war. The only other building in that plot of land was the US Army military chapel. Why also were there ESSO stations everywhere? So much for our close relationship with our former enemy. This book demonstrates the American-Third Reich commercial hookups."
5,thermostat for car fan,"I installed the thermostat easily. It was no problem using the guide attached. I inserted the sender(temp sender) into the water return,(to engine), water rubber pipe and used an 'O' clip (not supplied) to tighten the attachment to radiator. done, works a dream."
4,Hayden Automotive 3653 Economy Adjustable Thermostatic Fan Control,The thermostat arrived on time as promised. Its mounted in my 67 Mustang and works very well operating the two electric cooling fans mounted onto the radiator. The stat is wired to 2 relay coils and the relay contacts wired directly to the fans. Currently I have the probe stuck into the fin area but plan to mount it inside the radiator input hose.
1,thermostat?,Well I installed this item on my truck and it flat out didn't work basically just a headache to install (illegible instructions that make no sense at ALL) and once I did figure it out on my own it didn't work. Piece of junk. Don't waste your money...
1,Failed the first day of use,"This product seemed high quality, and installed without issue. It worked fine until it was used at full temperature to cycle the fans. With the engine cool, it now doesn't matter what the thermostat setting is, the fans are always stuck on. The relay doesn't seem to be stuck, it looks like the temperature sensing system failed.So, it broke after only 1 use. Would not recommend."
1,Junk,"Installed and the fan would not shut off, looks like unit had been already installed. Opened unit and contacts were sticking. Fan now won't turn on."
1,not as pictured,I also ordered this product thinking it was a clutch fan and I got it today and it was not a clutch fan. thermostatic cooling fan control? not what it said on the box in the picture. What I have is completely different!
2,Not about a boarding school at all,"First off, the jacket description of this book is evidently about another work. It is about an opera singer in the Austro-Hungarian empire who never goes anywhere near a boarding school. While this book delivers the required amount of sex, and some amusing period pieces, the translation or the writing dilute the enjoyment. The editors can be blamed not only for slip-ups throughout the text but for a major plot jump between two sentences late in the book. Readers looking for a fun, 'costume-drama' dirty book would be better served by Blue Moon's Belle Sauvage or Black Lace's Elena's Destiny or Darker than Love."
2,A Great Pocket Radio but Very Frail,"The DT200V is fantastic...BUT, the two AA batteries are heavy and the battery holder is weak. If you drop this radio on a hard surface the holder will break and then you can kiss your radio good bye. I've purchased several of these radios and all suffered the same end.Get the DT-300VW instead. It uses two, lightweight AAA batteries and is tougher. I'm going to buy another. My previous one finally suffered a weak key and spontaneous autoscan."
3,needs improvement,"This radio is much improved from the older model that I have. The case is better made and button layout better but the sound output from the ear bud is not good at all. It is scratchy to a level that I can,t use the ear buds at all. I tried other ear buds and all setings on the radio with no improvement"
2,Not impressed - at all...,"I bought this to take fishing in the Snake River Canyon in Idaho. I have a cheap radio that doesn't get too good of reception down there, so I got this one to improve the receiption and sound quality. Well, its not as good as the old cheap one... The only reason I give it two stars is that it is 'cute'..."
3,Sangean Radio,"This portable pocket size radio used to be able to transmit TV stations, which is why I purchased it. However, no one mentioned that this feature would not work after the conversion on June 12 - this featue was most important to me and now it is not available. Am considering returning the product."
1,Can't be a ghost box!,"All the 2012 models(the one they just shipped me)and up have been changed by the company to be ""un-hackable"" i.e. you can no longer alter it to be a ghost box. The new models mute when you scan. Why the manufacturer changed this should have you raising your eyebrows. They don't want people listening to spirits, eh?"
4,Sangean Radio,"This is our second Sangean pocket radio, the first one lasted 6-7 years before the battery compartment wiring corroded from a leaking battery. This new unit features new features, like the backlight and more memory, than the previous DT100 model. It should hopefully last as long as the last one. The only concern is the switch to Digital TV in February, I imagine we will lose the TV reception. That is too bad, as my wife uses it to listen to Letterman and the late shows with a pillow speaker. I dropped a star (4 out of 5) due to Sangean not addressing this issue which is scheduled in just three months."
5,Great Radio!,"This is a great radio.The reception is very good in Southwest Virginia (that means mountains). I use this radio for several hours each day, both at home and at work. The digital tuning and the presets make finding a station really easy....I am very glad that I upgraded from my Sony.The earbuds sound great and stay in my ears. Battery life is ok, but I have managed this by using some rechargeable batteries.UPDATE:10/14/2009Still solid as a rock. I have dropped this radio on the pavement several times and except for some minor scratches it is perfect. Reception is very good.TV channels are now obsolete, since the digital conversion, but I rarely used them anyway.Still using rechargeable batteries and I change them when the battery icon indicates a low battery.One of my favorite possessions."
4,Good Radio,"I've owned this radio three months. Quality is good, but reception is not as good as that of my car radio. Sangean provides an antenna (plugs into earphone hole) to improve reception when operating the radio using the built-in speaker. Speaker sound quality is good for such a small radio.Tuning is easy with preset memory. I recommend this radio and would buy it again"
4,Great Little Radio,"Solid little radio. Love having a speaker on a small radio, no need for earphones, which allows me to work and still listen to the game no matter what room I am in. Great AM reception allows me to pick up stations I usually can't get."
4,For a compact quality radio consider this one.,"Crisp digital tunning and controls, solid housing. Ear buds provided are mmmmm, but with good ear buds you end up with a nice sound. Speaker is ok for it's small size. AM reception is quite good, FM at times is spotty but could be my area. I don't think this is a good choice for jogging, you would have to hold it or keep it in a pocket. This radio is a level above most compact radios(2 1/2"" x 4"") and I really think it is worth the extra green backs."
4,sangean preset am/fm radio,"This is the 6th dt200x I have purchased. It is the best of its kind. I walk from 6 to 10 miles every day. I like to switch between talk radio and music without extra steps. The dt200x can go from am to fm without extra steps,and with 19 presets. Its light and durable as well."
5,A Mailman's Dream,"I am a Mailman on a walking route and need a radio that fits in my shirt pocket and has an external speaker. This radio has great sound, digital station readings and battery level meter. The radio has a 90 minute auto shut off that you can override, which I do. It is perfect and I just love it."
1,piece of junk !,will never buy this product anymore ! quit working only after few days ! rip off !!!!!!!had to trash it !!!
5,AM Second to none.,"I am quite staisfied with this little radio. It has an amazing AM tuner. I'd say it is as good as my Sangean WR-2 table top radio. We have a 15,000 watt AM station on 1310. It will still get a station 0n 1300, 150 miles away. During the day. FM may not be nearly as good, but still way above average. I read another review that said the ear buds were not up to snuff. I disagree.A couple of annoyances. It has a round bottom and will not stand up. Who would have thought? It really is hard to believe.It does not have an FM antenna built in. You have to plug in a wire. Unless you are using the ear buds which couple as the antenna. I have it on AM the majority of the time so that doesn't bother me much. All in all I would purchase it again, in spite of the round bottom."
4,Best for me.,"Very good reception, all three bands, comparable to DT-210V. Lighted screen and control buttons more user friendly, and very slight difference in size not noticeable."
3,A good basic radio,"This radio is a little bulkier than I expected. the functionalities are pretty basic: digital tuning, station pre-sets and AM/FM band switch, etc. I works well in the last month or so. I use it when biking to work. The C-Span radio signal used to be very weak when I was using a Sony FM tuner on an MP3 plaer. It is better now. But the diference is not that huge. While the Sony player is the size of a thumb drive, this one is the size of a deck of cards. As soon as I enter the hallway my office building, the signal immediately start to crack. But overall, it is not disappointing. I just feel when you have a radio of this size, it should be a lot more powerful in receiving signals and resolving them better."
4,No complaints,"The Sangean is a well-made, practical unit. The size is about the size of an ipod Touch and slightly smaller than the original ipod (if you can remember that far back!). In the Hartford/central Ct area the reception occasionally slips but I'm moving quite a bit when i listen so i expected that ""problem."" One reason I bought this particular unit is because of its integrated belt clip."
2,cheap construction plus lousy service,"i bought two of these (color me stupid). both had the same problem. If you drop this thing, the speaker wires get yanked at the plug and the connection gets broken. when i called for service i was told ""if you dropped it - no help."" This is a pocket portable, presumably good for listening while on the move and it was not designed to withstand any stress at all, dropping being the most obvious hazard. The radio works ok and the controls mostly make sense but it is very pricey for something you will never, ever be allowed to drop at pain of kissing your warranty good bye."
1,Poor Sound,The sound quality is so poor that it is next to useless to me and I'm planning to buy a different radio.
1,Worst soundingportable ever - I returned it,This was theworst sounding portabl;e radio I ever heard. I have a $5 radio that I purchased in Walmart that outperforms this. DON'T BUY IT! I returned mine right away.
3,Great battery life(2 AA),Pretty good overall...Instructions for programing quite difficult for me.Have had quite a long time and still cannot get stations to auto program.TV sound feature no longer works due analog/digital change.
3,This radio is not loud enough to be heard at a baseball game,"I am one of those Dodger fans that love to hear Vin Scully's voice even when I am at the stadium. For years I have used an old AM FM radio with an analog tuner, although it was tricky locking in a clean signal it worked just fine. This year I decided to treat myself to a new radio with a digital tuner to lock in an exact station. Unfortunately even though this radio has a crisp clear sound the maximum volume is so weak that the only way to hear it at the game is to hold it next to my ear or use the very low quality headphones that came with the unit. My friends who went to the game with me were very dissapointed because they are used to me bringing a radio and this did not cut it. Other than that it is a pretty cool, easy to use device. I would say probably over priced because of the lack of any kind of reasonable volume."
3,"Static, Noise on local stations","Extremely disappointed with the reception of this pocket radio. External antenna (or earbuds) doesn't seem to hold a station when the orientation of the radio itself changes, i.e. when you turn a corner while walking. My old Coby did that but I expected this priced radio to perform much better. Would not recommend to ANYBODY!"
3,Switch will fail,"Let me first say that our family has had about 6 or more of these or the predecessor model that had TV on it. They are a great little radio. BUT--eventually the on-off switch will fail, because there is a tendency to use it as a ""mute"" button during commercials. I thought--no problem, I'll just open it up and fix it ( probably a cracked solder joint) Due to the sandwiched style design of this unit, you CANNOT get to the switch to repair or remove it, so the unit becomes worthless. If you stay away from the switch, it will last a long time. I'd still say that this is a decent radio despite this issue."
2,I'm trying to like this radio...,"As the title says, I'm trying to like the DT-200X. I had the DT-400 for a couple years, and it worked great, until I dropped it into a mud puddle. Electronics do not like mud puddles! After deciding I did not need the weather radio function I decided to try the DT-200.First try, out of the package, put batteries in the radio and a static noise came from the speaker whether the radio was on or off. Returned it. Tried the DT-210 for a while and I decided I did not like it for various reasons.Ordered the DT-200X a second time. Out of the package, put batteries in, turned on the radio, and tuned it to a station... No sound. I made sure the speaker switch was in the correct position. Returning this one and requesting a direct replacement of the DT-200X.I like the functions and button/volume control positions of the DT-400, and will give the DT-200X a last try. I'm hoping it will not disappoint."
5,Radio Review,"Great little radio. Be sure to plugin either the antenna or earphones,they really improve the reception.Had a hard time figuring out how tosubmit this review though."
4,Good radio,"I bought my DT200VX to use during my long van pool commute when I could not hear the van's radio. The DT200VX isn't as sensitive as I had expected, but probably not unexpected, given the strength of the stations and the fact that I'm picking them up from inside the van. Other similar radios are probably no better. Sensitivity is much better around the house. Controls are easy to use once I became familiar with them. Ear phones give good quality sound. All in all, it does what I want and I recommend it."
4,Sangean pocket radio,The Sangeon Pocket radio is one of the better pocket radios that I have used. I made the mistake of putting a magnetically sensitive transit pass in my pocket when the radio was turned off and the transit pass still demagnitized. (My fault and not the radio)
1,not that happy,"I purchased this in April. It is now mid-June and already the FM & TV signals have failed. Can only pull in AM ...which I never listen to! Have tried twice to contact the company (e- and snail-mail), but they don't seem to be listening and/or responding. Hoping to be able to submit a more positive review of their customer service and this product soon ..."
1,Not Happy,Only had the product for a week and the power button cease to work - could not turn it on. Shipped it back to the company. Not too happy that I had to pay additional shipping charges and enclose a check so I could get it back. Haven't heard from the company. It has become an expensive pocket radio for having it one week.
4,The only one,This Sangean pocket radio is the only one I can find of this size that has AM/FM and TV audio . I have had them for the past 12 years and hope they keep making them this way for a long time .Christa Perry
5,THE BEST SMALL POCKET RADIO - BAR NONE,I love radios and I listen to them far more than I watch television. This radio exceeds my expectations and is superior to any small radio I have ever owned or tried. The radio's tuner is fantastic. The build quality is superb. It feels solid and the controls all feel well designed. The speaker sounds great for it's size. The display is easy to understand with plenty of information. The battery life blows all my other radios away. It has all the right features. I give this radio my highest recommendation and FIVE STARS...you won't go wrong buying this.
5,sangean dt200v am/fm review,a great little radio.i have purchased several in the past(sony & radio shack)and have been very unhappy with weak reception.this little radio has a very sensitive receiver and will pick up stations the others wont.it also has a great stereo sound if your into fm listening.i may buy another just in case they quit making this one.
2,Dead Electronics,"Sangean makes fine radios. This is not one of them. After about four months of use, all the electronic tuning features suddenly disappeared. So all I can do now is turn it on and off. I can't change stations or use the AM/FM/TV selecter. I'm just glad the last station I was listening to before the electronics failed was NPR."
2,"Great While It Lasted, but","My Sangean DT200V pocket radio failed after 2.5 years of infrequent use. I kept it in a padded pocket of my briefcase where it experienced no significant shocks or temperature extremes. It worked perfectly on the few occasions when I used it over the 2.5 year period, until yesterday. The buttons, switches, and display still work perfectly, but only very faint white noise can be heard, whether via speaker or via earphone. The volumn of the faint white noise is not significantly affected by the volumn control. The batteries are new, and there is no corrosion from the previous batteries."
3,Sangean DT-200X FM-Stereo AM/FM Ditigal Tuning Personal Receiver - Also knows as a pocket radio!,"I walk about 50 miles a week and take a radio along with me every morning. This is my second Sangean, the first having lasted about 2-3 years before the volume control went out. It stayed at maximum volume and would not respond when I tried several ways to turn down the volume. For the use it gets and the price I must say I am pretty satisfied with it. I do like the 90-minute automatic turn off as it is a good way to time my walk. The audio is clear and crisp and I like the speaker option as I go through headphones pretty quickly."
3,Sangean Radio,"I purchased the Sangean portable pocket sized radio, so far it has been an adequate radio. The reception for the most part is pretty good, considering I have it inside my electric cart all night, the reception still comes in pretty good. The sound is your typical tinny portable radio sound, not much different in that area. For the price I don't really think it is worth $50. I probably would have just bought something cheaper and dealt with a poorer reception."
4,WJR21@aol.com,I don't own one BUT I used to work at RadioShack AND when we started selling these we had a ton of returns. Suddenly we were not getting any more in. About 8 or 9 months later we started getting them back and low and behold the returns were no more. SOOO they improved there product. Now I do own four Sangean shortwave radios and I love everything about them.
5,radio review,It's a great little radio. The reception is pretty good and it's easy to use. You can either listen on headphones or use the built-in speaker. The digital display allows you to tune in exactly to your desired station.
4,Excellent radio for mail carriers,"I have to agree with previous reviews, this is an excellent radio. This is my third radio in 6 months and it is the only one I have been able to pick up a local station just about anywhere in town. Only two drawbacks for my personal use and they are: 1) lack of weather resistance and 2) external audio volume/quality at higher volume (to hear over surrounding noise)."
1,Sangean DT200VX AM/FM/TV Portable Pocket Radio,I read the reviews before my purchase of the Sangean DT200VX and found most favorable so I decided to try it even though the cost was considerable. My purchase date was 03/26/2009. Unfortunately for me the audio stopped working just 2 months later on 06/03/2009. I'm very dissapointed.
1,Improved but still hard to use,"I had an older model of this radio that gave up after many years of use. This model has been improved but gobbles up battery power quickly. You will be soon buying rechargeables. Also, it's difficult to ""program"" and use the presets, even with some improvements over the previous model. The TV audio is useless since it covers only channels 2 - 13 or so and the volume drops when you select that band. Don't bother with this turkey. Look into a Sony Walkman at about 1/2 the price. Ray"
5,pocket radio,"I find Sangean products to be very reliable, long lasting, probably make the best radios money can buy these days."
4,Old Style Compact AM-FM Radio Still Of Use,"This almost antique device is still one of the best small AM/FM radios on the market. While its TV band is now useless, having a small radio to use at sports events to listen to the live radio coverage of the games is very nice, especially for those who are not experts in the particulars of the event.Its strengths are its ease of tuning and switching between AM and FM, and the fact that it has both earphone and speaker outputs, although the speaker is really not very good. It weakness is that it has no preprogrammed station buttons and its automatic station memory function makes the user toggle through 20 stations before repeating. Worse, the radio forgets its programming when the battery is changed.Nevertheless, for those who like to listen to radio in bed, it is not only quite convenient, but also automatically shuts itself off after about 15 minutes (its very easy to turn back on), which both saves its batteries and gives the user's ears a rest."
4,Sagean DT-200XFM Stero,I gave this unit 4 stars...that said the only thing I didn't care for was the ear buds that came with the unit. Didn't fit my ear all that well and kind of funky looking as well. Other than that very please with this unit.
2,Circuit-Bending,There's possibly 20 pages of useful information in this book. maybe 15 interesting ones
4,casio sk1 circuit bending,"great book for beginning circuit benders. you can go to the publishers website for close ups of the circuit board diagrams which was helpful because the ones in the book are printed kind of small. if you want to get into circuit bending, this is the book for you. my casio sk1 is now able to produce sounds that i never thought it was capable of and the combinations are endless and very unpredictable, which is a good thing in circuit bending!"
3,condition,"It was not in good condition, some pages were stucked due to excesive humidity. Besides that the pictures of the poses are great."
1,What is the purpose of this book?,"I am just thinking what is the purpose of this book. People wondering about how CLEAR the pictures are. Yes. It should be given 1 star.But, with these clear pictures the book can be used to show a person who is new to yoga, about how different asanas look like.It could be really difficult and in my personal opinion, dangerous to start practising with this book as the only reference. Asanas are displayed without any explanation/directions.[webaite]has proper explanation for each asana.Breathing plays 60% of work and final pose playes 40% of the work. Without knowning about how to breathe in each asana, you can not get anything from it.You should need additinal reference from Iyengar Yoga books or Viniyoga books where you get direction of how to go to eash pose with proper breathing."
2,Not very adjustable,"I wouldn't buy them again. They are priced right, but the depth stops are useless. You can't really adjust them to make the depth change. And the allen bolts that hold them in place strip out as soon as you try and tighten them. We tried using them for a minute or two and set them aside."
5,Help! Please explain this title to me!,"This is a wonderful book...I can't say enough about it, and much has already been said that's said better than I could say it...so this is what I have to say: HELP! Please explain the title to me in such a way that I can actually understand it. Otherwise, I'm stuck in an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" dilemma....either pretend I understand it, or ask what it means ""in plain English."" Stanley Plumly uses the reference on page 107, and then Mary Ruefle does so on page 56, first paragraph....maybe I'm just a simple non-English major who can't distinguish a metaphor from a simile, but I need help."
2,I am glad I didn't spend MY money on this desk...,I won a room makeover and chose this item as a new desk for my made over office. We received this desk a few weeks ago and it was WELL packed (4 stars) although because it was so well packed it was hard to get out of the box (it ships in two boxes).We had already put together another desk so we decided to put this desk together also. The directions were EXTREMELY hard to read (print very small) and the diagrams were hard to interpret. I did step one and decided to get a handy man to put the desk together for me. It took him 2 hours to put it togther.It is sturdy and seems sound. The hard drive fit well but my HP printer had to be placed on the bottom shelf sideways. You need a narrow upright printer for it to fit correctly on that shelfI would NOT buy this product again and I am real glad the money did not come out of my pocket.
4,Great for the price,"I was looking for a glass desk that was cheap and this is it. Good construction, light and easy to move, doesn't break when moved like wood does, just be careful with the glass obviously. The shelves are thinner than the top sadly, but it's understandable. I thought it was simple to get together, take apart, and back together. You do need a short, small (not wide) tower computer for it though... BUT I just removed the little holder for the CPU and fits perfect now. Good space for dual 20"" monitors or a widescreen. Only con... harder to hide the wires than wood desks. I use zip ties by the poles so it doesn't look to bad."
5,Good transaction,The ping pong paddle cleaning kit arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. It works great for cleaning the paddle between uses.
4,For anyone interested in keeping their paddle maintained,"I play for a couple hours every week day with a Carlos Chiu Butterfly paddle. The paddle when new was incredible, the spins and the speed were beyond what any of my opponents have ever seen. As time went on, with constant cleaning using this product, the paddle has remained FAR stickier than any of my opponents more expensive paddles. For a small $20 investment, I would say it's a small price to pay to double the life of your paddle's spin an control, and keep that winning edge ;)."
4,Noticed an immediate impact,"My paddle was very old, 10+ years old and not spinning as expected, a chop response would get smashed by the opponent, after using this product - saw an immediate change, now see the impact of a chop response in a positive way; would recommend folks with good paddles to clean it up quite regularly. The kit came in well packed and was also very easy to use"
3,"Dry dry dry, but not bad","This book is very dry in writing style (even though there are multiple authors) but is nevertheless a worthwhile read. The illustrations are the best part, showing many interesting artifacts from early human history. It would have been better if the authors had excercised more judgement and selection. Many sections seem to be summaries of academic research reports without any clear significance to the lay reader."
3,why did i buy it,PSI Woodworking LCENTSS22 #2 MT w/ 1-Inch Crown Super Wood Lathe Drive CenterNot sure why I bought it. It works ok but not for holding large blanks. I now use a 1 1/4 inch four tooth driver that works great. This sits in my garage now.
4,safe,"it provides good gripping power, but in the event of a catch it will give preventing a disaster"
1,defective,"I must have received a defective drive center. The point is supposed to be spring loaded. The one I received is recessed inside of the spurs, will not move, stuck in this position and it is impossible to get the drive on center."
2,Lathe drive center,Thought it might be better than pounding a four lipped drive center into a wood block. Either I'm using it wrong or it indeed can't do the lob.The prongs slips and saws a circle instead of holding the wood stock for turning.
4,Very nice jazz vocalist,"There is a sort of ease in her delivery. Very nice voice with cookin' jazz accompaniment. And some of the best scat singing I've heard. You know, sometimes you wish they would stick to just singing the lyrics. Also, there are interesting arrangements, such as ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"" in four four, rather than the usual three four.If you are a Jazz Vocalist collector, give this one a try, a fresh sound."
3,Disappointing,"This CD, a tribute to pianist Bill Evans, leaves me cold. The arrangements are excellent and the backup trio really move through the music. The problem is Sutton, who just doesn't swing. When she wants to be edgy, she adopts an annoying nasal voice. The rest of her vocal tics sound equally mannered. Too bad, as the positive reviews had left me hoping for better."
3,decent enough,"I didn't go ""wow"" and didn't go ""ick"" either. It was ok, but I won't be playing this one over and over like I will my Jane Moneheit and Diana Krall stuff."
3,A nice summary of the secret bomb project.,"For those of you who can read Rhodes book, that is the best on the subject. This is a nice summary book about the bomb project that unleashed the atomic bomb onto Western Civilization. Here one can read about how Groves and Oppie selected the testing center and grounds along with the scientists that proved they could build the ultimate in destruction. The scientists included several who were Soviet agents. This is a nice overview read about this important topic. With the advent of Third World nations discovering the secrets of the bomb, this is very relevant in today's society.This is a book for teens. However, I found myself learning something about the project from this book."
5,amazon books,Got this book at a great price. Condition was great. Love this author have many of his books but can't always afford new. Can afford a used book that is like new.
4,"Not the best player, but a dependable companion","I've owned this little machine for about 10 years. I don't even play bridge any more. The computer players are idiosyncratic and sometimes rather maddening, but I have to say, I've gotten a lot of mileage for the price."
3,Bridge Shadow,Am not sure if Pro Bridge and Bridge Shadow is the same. I'm not that stupid but this game is a little confusing for me.
3,"2.5, maybe...","Raymond Chandler's wisecracking, star-crossed private eye Philip Marlowe is transplanted into the swinging '60s where hopheads, strippers and psychiatrists join the usual compliment of thugs and goons that make his life miserable. James Garner gets a nice dry run for the ""Rockford Files"" TV show, while Rita Moreno bares all in her climactic stripping scene. Honestly, the script is not that great -- for the life of me I couldn't actually figure out who did what, or why... But it's still a fun film, in a campy kinda way. The film's one truly great moment is a scene is with Caroll O'Connor as a police detective who, having wearied of playing Marlowe's schnook, bursts into a violent tirade about how lousy his job is, and nearly beats the handcuffed private eye to death. It's a scene that could stand tasteful recycling elsewhere and, I suspect, was only in the film because O'Connor improv-ed it and made *something* good happen in this otherwise somewhat addled production..."
5,Just read the book,"I had just finished reading ""The Little Sister"" a book that I had read years ago. I found it so enjoyable on the second reading, that I wanted to see the film which was made from the book. The reviews on the picture were not good at the time it came out, but I found the picture well done with a great cast. The DVD was hard to fined, but I was lucky enough to find a new copy at a great price, and really enjoyed Marlowe."
4,Garner is Marlowe,"In this film James Garner does a great job in being the down on his luck, in the middle of it all detective Phillip Marlowe. he is the strength of this movie. The writing is good and has an outstanding cast of character actors. Carroll Oconnor, Gayle Hunnicutt, Sharynn Farrell, and Kenneth Tobey to name a few.If you collect mystery or detective films this is a great addition to your collection."
3,Garner as Marlowe,"I remember seeing this as a youth,and enjoyed it then as now. I got a little more excited then at Rita Moreno's strip tease then, but I was an impressionable 13! She is still a beauty, and the movie has that dry Garner approach to humor that I find refreshing with all the ""in you face"" stuff today. The twist at the end is great too."
3,Austin Powers meets Humphrey Bogart,"James Garner followed Humphrey Bogart and Dick Powell's 1940's act (and preceded Elliot Gould and Robert Mitchum) in this late 60's revival of Raymond Chandler's classic shamus character, with mixed results. Marlowe's deadpan private dick persona seems a bit out of place with all the love beads, paisley and acid-spiked cigarettes swirling about him. (I suppose you could argue that it boosts the film's appeal on a purely camp level). Garner makes up for most of the incongruity (and the rather complicated plot) with his usual devil-may-care on-screen appeal. A few supporting perfomances also keep things moving along, including a very sexy Rita Moreno and surprisingly funny Bruce Lee. Lee eats up his two brief scenes with much aplomb and choreographs a memorable rooftop ""exit"" for his irrepressible Winston Wong. Not classic Chandler, but an entertaining curio nonetheless."
4,marlowe,"if you liked james garner in the ""rockford files"" you will dig this,a typical gumshoe movie of the era, but a cut above the ""our man flint,and ""matt helm"" movies.james garner plays phillip marlowe,a detective who doesnt like to start trouble, but always seems to solicit it. he runs into the path of a gangster who has a henchman,who's not a-typical....you guessed it!Bruce lee. the scene where bruce visits marlowe's office,is what the movie ""Bullit "" was to car chases,and what every rock star tried to do to a hotel room.a must see for Lee fans!"
2,"Way, way diluted -- not resemble photo","Take the citra-solv in the photo (the orange citra-solv we fell in love with), fill a bottle one-third with it, then add 2/3 water and voila -- the current citra-solve. WAY WAY more diluted. Not even orange as in the photo but a pale yellow. Shame on you, Citra-solve."
4,"You get results, but the taste is awful","I think this product is called MotherLove for a reason -- there is no way you would take it unless you really, really loved someone as only a mother can! It tastes AWFUL. I can hardly get it down. I ended up using this 2X a day and the capsules 2X a day because I just couldn't make myself take the liquid 4X each day. Even though it says not to drink anything within 15 minutes - a chaser is needed! The proof is in the milk output, though. I saw an increase of a few ounces within a day. As a working Mom who is wanting to EBF my infant son, but having trouble pumping enough milk to meet his daily needs, I would recommend this product to a friend."
1,Don't waste your money,This is my second bottle and decided to stop taking the fenugreek tincture I was taking in addition to this product. My milk supply decreased dramatically after a couple days. MotherLove does not publish how many milligrams of fenugreek is in More Milk Plus. I called MotherLove and they told me there is 130mg of fenugreek per dose. This is a very small amount! Going forward I will continue to use More Mild Plus but will not purchase more when this container is empty. I recommend just buying fenugreek tincture. The product I found at a local compounding pharmacy has 333mg of fenugreek per dose.
4,Tastes Awful... But It Works,"I have seen a 3-4 oz. increase in milk production per day so far. Will continue using and hope for more. Yes, it tastes awful."
1,Description of Use--Buy the Capsules!!,"The taste is horrible! Mothers will do a lot for their babies, but save yourself the trouble and buy the capsule version! Here's a description of what the product is designed for:A safe and effective formula designed to quickly increase breast milk for breastfeeding mothers."
3,Success not proven,"I took More Milk Plus for about a month. It's easy to take. I put it in some tea or water and it didn't taste awfull. Although, I felt tingly sensations at first, there was no noticable increase in milk prodution."
5,product did not work for me,"Tastes HORRIBLE and it did not work for me. I also tried teas; some other stuff and nothing worked, so maybe it wasn't the product. Just sayin it was expensive for the tiny bottle and it didn't work."
3,didn't work for me but could work for others?,"Not sure why but the herbs never worked for me, but then again many others are successful so it's worth a try"
1,Please beware,"As some others, I would like to mention that this blend contains fenugreek, which may cause gases with some of the babies. My little one started being fussy, was having stomache cramps, gases, was crying and therefore difficulties to fall asleep. After I stopped it took my baby one week to get back to normal well-being. So please watch out for your baby reaction.I have written to the Seller, but they refused to refund as the bottle was opened. While had I bought it at Motherlove directly, they would be able to refund or replace."
1,Amazon shipped Alcohol version!,"I ordered the Alcohol FREE version, once my wife tried it we discovered it had alcohol. Per manufacturer's website the alcohol free version says on the front label that it's alcohol free...very disappointing that Amazon can't get that right. I'm not the first person complaining about it!!! Now, we have to wait couple more days to get the new order...hoping they ship the right thing this time again."
1,didn't work for me,I'm pumping and a friend of mine heard about more milk plus and told me. I took it for two days and it actually decreased my milk supply with 2 oz. I don't have enough milk as it is so i stopped taking it.
1,Ugh,"I bought More Milk Plus despite the numerous reviews noting that it has a foul taste. I have an iron stomach and adventurous palate, but even I couldn't handle this stuff. After one dose, I poured it down our kitchen sink and now my husband is complaining about a stench in our house. Obviously, I can't comment on how effective this product is at increasing lactation. I do suspect it would work fine to keep deer out of your yard. No complaints whatsoever, however, about the vendor from whom I purchased it."
3,strong scent/tast,"I'm not sure if this worked any better for me than the pills. I last taking this for two weeks, the taste was too strong for me. I did mix it with a little juice but sometimes that didn't even help. I think I will still stick to the pills. I do love the Motherlove brand tho!"
1,"Contained ""Grain Alcohol""","This product had a main ingredient of 43-53% grain alcohol. Not sure how ""Alcohol Free"" contained grain alcohol. Awful misrepresentation."
1,DO NOT BUY MAKE YOU GAG!!!!,I didn't have time to figure out if this worked because I literally GAGGED every time I tried taking it. I rarely ever throw up and do not have a sensitive gag reflex and I couldn't choke this stuff down to save my life. Don't waste your money on this- buy the pills!
1,Didn't work for me,I used it everyday and it didn't work for me. There were many great reviews of how it did wonders for people so I thought I would try. Now I am just buying OTC items and the pharmacy and those seem to work better.
1,Tastes awful and doesn't work,"Unfortunately, after two weeks of consistently taking this product (which tastes extremely bad, I might add) and pumping / breastfeeding every 1-2 hours my milk supply has continued to drop. Sorry to say that it simply doesn't work, even combined with the strictest extraction regime."
1,growth charts,"I typed in growth charts for my baby's records & I found the price for them, but there are NO pictures of them! I like what they might look like by the patterns. But I have a hard time ordering something that I cant see first. This site needs to show more pics of what they are trying to sell."
3,"Lorca, more personal than literary","The biography is useful, but I hoped it would reflect the works of the poet/playwright in their symbolic complexity. I found it superficial, and not quite satifying."
5,A Work of Literary Art,"Andrew Miller's book is a work if literary art, my friends! I am in the eighth grade right now (soon to be 9th...HIGH SCHOOL..hehe), and have read this book twice. It is a great read packed with supsense and adventure. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Another incredible album from The Hang Ups,With the departure of John Crozier and a new bass player added to the mix (Aaron Lundholm) it only makes sense that the sound of the band would change. While maintaining the sweet meloncholy pop that made them cult gods they've turned themselves into a Kinks(ish) Pop/Rock band... The melodies are even more catchy than ever and the harmonies are sublime (thanks to Mr. Ittner in the studio)... Excellent album.
3,Not up to expectations,"I was a little disappointed at this effort. So We Go was one of my all-time faves. I should have known they couldnt repeat it without the guitar playing of John Crozier. Second Story is more folky sounding, lacking the lovely, fuzzy distortion atmospherics and understated production quality of So We Go. Still, this is tasty pop confection served with a few tangy twists. Absolutely worth checking out."
3,wimpy but pretty,"the idea that people would compare the hang ups to the Kinks is flat out preposterous--that's not saying the Minneapolis popsters don't have merit, however. far better to compare them to a lot of very wimpy Sarah Records outfits from the 80s--nor is that a bad thing. its just that there are a number of bands out there that do this kind of pop stuff with more teeth and daring: PAPAS FRITAS, THE BLACK WATCH, IVY, AND SUGARPLASTIC. still, ""the Queen"" is an undeniably great great song, one you can play over and over again. the rest of the record is very very wimpy, but pretty. i used to love the hang ups when they were fuzzier and dirtier (their cover of the Byrds ""Eight Miles High"" on another release is really worth searching out). just wish they'd get their distortion pedals from the pawn shops!!"
3,i hate disappointment,"get used to it. some one is trying to shape these guys into the standard issue americana folk-rock pop band, but this disc doesn't have the throat-lump inducing beauty of their earlier discs, but guess what? it's still great pop music, but the singers voice really needs some dressing up, it's so feathery.much has been made of the easter/dixon production on this but i don't think the atmosphere is as rich as the two earlier records. the songs are frequently great, but why try to rock out hang ups? it's wasted, just be heartbreaking and beautiful, it's what you do!still, this is a damn good record and has many wonderful moments, more echo and more john crozier."
3,Work in progress ?,I found a couple of worthy cuts but the remainder sounds like a 1st cut demo with the tape speed turned down. Annoying!
1,What Happened?,"I can't believe it. Everything I held dear about the Hang Ups is gone. It's as if someone told them, ""Look, if your next album doesn't do well, your career is over. What you guys play isn't selling right now, so we're going to hook you up with a couple of REM's old producers to make you sound like everyone else. Oh, and by the way, lose the quirky songwriting and guitar parts."" And the worst part is, it appears that they took this advice to heart. Gone is everything that made them unique; in its place is good solid generic songwriting. They sound like warmed over Semisonic.I can't ever remember waiting for a new release so eagerly and being so disappointed."
2,Kind of Weak,I found this cd to be sort of a let down. I loved So We Go and thought this would be such a good follow-up. Mitch Easter is one of my all-time favorite composers and producers so I was convinced his talents would produce a great cd. Maybe all of this hype for me was too much. After getting the cd the day it came out and listening to it a couple times I felt completely let down. Not what I expected at all. Then I saw them live in Duluth MN and man did that suck. The worst Hang Ups show I've seen and I've seen plenty. The cd lacks the catchy and melodic tunes that are so powerful in So We Go. On an upnote.... the web site is cool. www.thehangups.com
5,Watercolour for Absolute Beginners,"""Great Book for the Begginneer""I like this beeo a lot. There are simple exercises for the beginner to follow along with."
1,rattles like crazy,"This thing is built ok, heavy duty bolt and nut and whatnot, but the spinning nob has a lot of play and rattles loudly when idling in my old truck. it jiggled so much that i removed it."
5,spinner,works just fine. great for arthritic elbows to use and I reccomend it to my friends who are happy with mine
3,Too noisy and the knot spinner loose,It makes a clicking sound when the truck shakes and more louder if it is at low rpm .The knot spinner it's a kind of loose and feel like it mite break.Tie bracelet was to thick for my steering wheel so I had to modified it .
4,Good value,"My husband is recovering from shoulder surgery and this spinner makes it possible for him to get around town and to physical therapy. It installed quickly and feels solid on the steering wheel. It squeaks a little but he doesn't mind. I don't know how long it will last, but if you are looking to get one for temporary use this is an excellent value. Make sure you check your local laws before you use one though - some states regulate them!"
3,You get what you pay for...,"Overall I am happy with this purchase. I got it for the forklift I drive at work. My complaint is that the mounting bracket is made from 16 ga steel (1/16"" thick) and is very flimsy. I put a lot of torque on the knob because I do a lot of turning while sitting still, and I actually twisted the bracket. Since I work in a machine shop I simply made a stronger bracket.Also, the design puts the hinged part of the bracket on the outside of the wheel, so if you let the wheel spin in your hands while coming out of a turn, you're gonna get whacked in the hand by the hinge.Overall....it's worth 10 bucks."
4,classic steering wheel spinner aka: suicide knob,"wheel spinner worked very well, except i would recomend that you super glue the rubber spacer or inner device cinch with the open or end (both ends) are facing the inside hinge, glue to the device and not your steering wheel! this will prevent the rubber spacer from twisting out over a period of use.my steering wheels were on chevy silverado trucks and the device even after tightening as far as it would go still sliped a little, but it was manageble"
5,So helpful!,"This seems sturdy and is easy to use. Makes those tight turns so easily. Got it because I hurt my wrist and this keeps me from having to rotate it when driving the lawn mower. Does need extra gaskets for mower; otherwise, it comes out and spinner dangles."
3,An Urban 'Grapes of Wrath',"If the choices the girl makes seem strange, the modern reader must try to imagine the harsh realities of the Great Depression, of being an extra mouth to feed when there is no work for the man of the house. Soon the generation that grew up during the Depression will be gone, and it is books like this that will provide clues about humanity in the face of inadequate health care and widespread social insecurity."
2,All the bells and wistles but where's the inigma decoder?,"I spent many hours trying to figure out how to use this software and I am stumped. The enclosed pamphlet and help features talk to a user who has experience in the recording industry and understands the jargon. For example - when you create a multitrack project, how do you record sound,songs or whatever to each track? Simple right. Wrong. It never tells you. You have to read 30 odd pages of jumble and try to figure it out. After 6 hours I still could not figure it out.My suggestion. Unless you know of someone who has used and understands this product. Buy something less expensive and more basic. Good luck."
3,informative but dated,An informative book releying heavily on early Jaguar literature. It has an English slant to the text which adds some charm. If it hadn't been coupled with the Nigley Thorley XK8 book I wouldn't have bought it.
3,A novelty book for the Shakespeare Buff,"If you are a Shakespeare fan, Mike Ashley's book Shakespearean Whodnnits, a collection of short stories by various sci-fi/fantasy and mystery writers edited by Mike Ashley is a novelty book with different twists on the plot of some of the plays (e.g. Much Ado About Nothing) or an attempt to fill in the gaps in the plot (i.e. As You Like It)or the author's own new version of one of the plays (i.e. Hamlet).Another book edited by Ashley is Classical Whodunnits which has the main persons of the short stories be characters from ancient history or from classical literature."
4,Mighty Bright Sight Reader Light,This is a nifty little night light. It's far superior to many on the market. Having the plug-in adapter is a good idea.
4,Goood Book,"This is a great read. Definitely two thumbs up. The only thing I didn't like about it was the very un-needed ""A Year Later"" portion at the end revealing an outcome to the girls lives. I kind of like how the stories didn't end ""happily ever after"" (so similar to real life situations). For that reason, MaryAnn could have done without the eplilogue and the book would have still been wonderful."
5,Worth the Buy,"First off, the sex scenes are hot! I was actually blushing with my married self. The words definitely captured the moment. Now I'm not one to finish every book I pick up, since I have a busy life, but this was a fast read. It flowed nicely too. My favorite part was the Epilogue. That was such a nice touch to see what happens to the girls a year later. This book is a good example of HOW NOT TO ACT in a relationship. Amen!"
2,I'm waiting...,"I'm still waiting for this book to get really good and I'm done reading it! I did in fact take this book on vacation with me and it took me seven days to finish it! I usually read a really good book in one - three days. The book is not the worse I have read, but certainly it not one of the better ones. For a debut I guess, it will suffice."
1,Seriously Lacking Substance,"I was really excited about reading this book because of the great cover and all the hype surrounding it before it came out, calling it the black version of Sex in the City. While I feel the author has potential, I did not enjoy this book. All the novellas seemed pretty much identical and none of the characters moved me at all. I did not feel a connection or care about any of them. I am a single black woman and to read a book about a bunch of hard-up sisters trying to get men that either do not want them or men that want them but they are too silly to realize it was halfway humiliating. I wish the author well with future projects but this one leaves a lot to be desired."
2,Better luck next time,"At the risk of incurring the wrath of reading sisters everywhere, I have to say that I was disappointed with this book. The characters were poorly fleshed out, the storylines weak and the resolutions rushed and unsatisfying. The characters lacked inviduality and there was nothing in any of the stories except really descriptive sex scenes to hold a reader's attention. In additon, the conclusions for all of the five stories are slapped together at the end of the book like an afterthought. The author does have potential (that is most clearly illustrated in the sex scenes) but she must really learn to develop both the characters and the plots of her stories ."
5,Loved it!,"First I would like to start off by congratulating Maryann Reid on an excellent job of networking for her first novel, and she is extremely personable. I was very impressed and thoroughly enjoed this book. I read it in less than 8 hours, and did not want to put it down. From one story to the next it kept me entertained, and in some cases with my mouth dropping to the floor. I was eager to see the outcome of each story, and felt like I was there with the characters. In addition Ms. Reid did a great job of marketing and interconnecting for her book. If you like Eric Jerome Dickey, Virginia DeBerry, Donna Grant, Sharon Mitchell,Sheneska Jackson and Pearl Cleage, you cant pass up this read."
2,It Could Have Been Better,"The good part. Very juicy, realistic sex scenes, and some fun dialogue along the way. I give kudos to the writer for even being able to get something like this published, since apparently there aren't any Black women who have Sex in the City...On the other hand, as far as the plots were concerned, I feel the writer could have taken another few seasons to flesh out the character development. It made it seem like the women were pretty canvases, with no heart, backbone, morals or personality. However, the book is very fast-paced and racy, and if that is what you are looking for, then buy this book."
4,Single Sistas on the move,"I enjoyed these stories. The best part, you weren't left hanging wondering what happened to so and so. Although I personally don't see the point of being involved with someone and seeing someone on the side. Too much work. ___ or get off the pot is my theory. I don't think that someone in their twenties would be so obsessed with being married. Being in a relationship maybe but, marriage no."
4,ok,"This is a collection of stories about five women trying to find love. I think all the stories could have been written without being so explicit, and nasty, all the women were easy, and desperate. I ordered the book thinking it was a novel."
5,It's about time that someone has....,"...shown that women can be as bad as men. The main characters in the book make some major, and sometimes silly mistakes. The men in the book were cool, but it was the women causing all the drama. This book was unique in that aspect. We women do have lots of issues, and can't blame men for our problems. The book had me laughing on the train, bus, etc. I felt like I was reading someone's diary...except in my diary I don't even get that detailed....This is top on my Christmas gift list."
2,Leaves much to be desired!,"While it wasn't a complete waste of time, I am glad that I checked this book out from my local library. It really fell short of my expectations. The biggest problem is that it lacked depth. I'm not a writer but I can definitely tell that Maryann Reid could have developed her characters more. (Perhaps it would have been better if she focused on fewer characters). I understand that this book is a light read but it lacked too much. Furthermore, the ending seemed rushed."
4,My man!!,"I got this book as a birthday gift from my man--out of all people. He said he read it before and that I could learn a lesson. Anyway, I thought the book was excellent! First, as a woman WITH A MAN, I don't want to be single again! Those girls went through too much mess. I love the line when Farah says that when men cheat, it is nothing personal, just a man thing. I had to think on that for a while. Also, I really felt Alaya's pain when she lost that good brother. There is NO MALE BASHING in this book. I read the other posts and I think the women who did not like this book, may have been looking for that. Ms. Reid is very honest and showed that women are just as clueless as men sometimes and just because someone is educated doesn't mean they can't make foolish mistakes.Definitely a buy."
5,Sex.....and I can say I am one of the single sisters.,"Even though I am divorced and now back on the dating scene, I can seriously relate to this book and not at all happy to be back in the dating game and this book just depressed me. Not to say that the book wasn't good (it was great), it just showed me what I will continue to look forward to.This book was about 5 women all in their twenties and their trail and tribulations of the dating game. Some got engaged and some remained single, either by choice or not, but we got to go along on their bumpy ride to their destination.The characters were so vivid, it was like you were having a relationship chat with one of your girlfriends. The author hit it right on time, because that is exactly what all women go through. You see yourself in this book and you have to laugh or maybe cry and just like Erkle say, ""Did I do that?"""
3,"Nice try, but it could have been better","I read this book in one evening. I think it was a good try by the writer, but I was hoping for much more than a chocolate dipped version of Sex in The City (the book characters even drink cosmopolitans for goodness sake...)This might be a good rainy day read, but it's the kind of book that you read once, then pass off to someone else. The sex scenes could have been a little hotter. You'll be entertained, but you won't get a buzz on..."
3,So So,"I agree with most of the other reviews, this book was so so. I would also agree that the characters came across as over sexed and in my books none of them deserves dates let alone ""husband material"". The characters came across as wishy washy with no real depth at all. Successful young woman compromising their integrity to get a man, little wonder they are still single."
4,5-star if it's printed on SACD or LP.,"Very dynamic voice and extrememly sexy especially when it's winding down or winding up. It's not jazyy nor boring.Equipment:1. Source: Original 1997 Rega Planet, Muse 2 D/A, Synergistic Research X-series cable.2. Speakers: 1994 Tannoy Edinbergh TW3. Pre-amp: Wright-sound WPL20A4. Power-Amp: bi-amp (Wright-sound WPA50-50, home-brew 45/2A3).5. Monster Retro and Naim speaker cables."
4,xXx~*YoU wAnT tO rEaD tHiS*~xXx,"This is an awesome CD!!! If I had to classify them I'd say they're somewhere in-between pop/punk/rock. It's mostly filled with upbeat melodies, which contradict the emotional lyrics at times. The band is from L.A., they all have blonde hair, and reflect that surfy-sound. This CD is pretty hard to find anywhere else, so I recommend you buy it now! Their sound could definitely remind you of Weezer, or The Ataris. CHECK OUT THIS BAND, YOU'LL LOVE EM...I promise."
5,The choices we make,"This book gives you something to think about. At mid-life, are we responsible to ourselves, or to the people we love? Change is sometimes a choice, and sometimes thrust upon us. Sophie has always lived to please others. Now she needs to decide the wisdom of this."
3,Best of .38 Special DVD Collection,"... Very high quality PCM Hi-Fi stereo audio (5 stars); clear plastic album type case and disc are manufactured to an exceptionally high standard (5 stars); limited song line up (0 stars) song compilation is also weak (2 stars) because this group's best albums were ""Tour de Force"" and ""Special Forces.""Combined rating for this product is three stars.Note: PCM or ""Pulse Code Modulation"" is your standard CD quality digital audio but with an extended dynamic range and higher resolution in the DVD-format. Test equipment is the Bose Acoustic Wave Music System (Made in U.S.A); coupled with monster brand cable connections and audio grade Xindak XF-500 power filters."
1,THIS SWEEPER IS AWFUL ! (not my first Bissell either),"Only good thing is it's light weight as I am in a wheelchair. I was attracted to it by the price. Well, you get what you pay for. It doesn't pick up things. I am using it for small scraps and threads and the usual fuzzies and dust on a carpet. It's AWFUL. Wish I would have returned it. It makes my work harder. So, be aware......before you buy."
1,Very Disappointed,The sweeper does not work on hard floors. It just pushes the dirt around. Sure it picks up apple jacks - but I want it for dirt not food particles. The guys at the store loved it for carpeting; they were paying with it when I bought one. But if you have anything other than carpeting.... very disappointing!!
2,Doesnt work as well as others...,"I bought this for 15.00 at a linen store for my kids to use to sweep kitchen hardwood floor after dinner. It lasted one week. The handles come unscrewed and some dirt just gets pushed around (1/4""hard food crumbs or flat crumbs) - it seems to get hair/lint/dust okay if you clean brushes after each use. I don't want to do that as it is for my children's chores. Then after one week - it started making a clunking noise and the roller brush falls partway off when opening dust chamber to empty. I will return this and get a more expensive but worth it Oreck brush sweeper. (I have an older model oreck brush sweeper I use on the back screen porch - it even picks up pollen)"
3,"Carpet yes, laminate no","I purchased this product almost a year ago. It works well on low pile carpet and rugs. However it does not pick up dirt, hair or grit on tile or laminate floors. If you are using this for carpet, go for it. If however you need something that goes from carpet to tile or wood floors, then get a different model."
3,Bissell Sweep-Up Sweeper,"We recently put in bamboo flooring and I wanted something that would help keep the floors clean, so I researched sweepers. I read reviews on Amazon and decided to look for the Bissell Sweep Up in the retail stores. I didn't want to invest $20, and someone on Craigslist was selling a brand new one for half the price. Sweet!Today, I wish I saved my money to buy something else. The Sweep Up is good for medium-sized particles like sand (small being dust bunnies and large being baguette bread crumbs). My floors are sand free, but the dust bunnies and bread crumbs are still hanging out. The Sweep Up launches the bunnies in the air and seems to just push the crumbs around, too big to catch in the brush bristles.My Sweep Up is probably going to make it onto Craigslist again, and I will continue to use a broom and dust pan until I find a stick vacuum to clean our floors."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this sweeper, having read some reviews of how well it picks up dog hair. I bought it to use on an antique rug which was showing some wear & tear from years of being vacuumed. I have 2 dogs that shed a lot, and have to clean the rug every other day. This sweeper certainly does pick up the fur, but you must sweep in only one direction. If you try to go back and forth, it deposits the fur back on the rug! Inconvenient, to say the least. I tried using it this way by just walking in circles around the rug. The last straw was when the main brush fell out while I was sweeping. Every time I put it back in, it fell out again. I returned it, and am planning to spend a little more on an Oreck."
2,Not like my old Bissel,I needed to buy a new sweeper for my room where I keep my pets. I had to replace the one my daughter bent. This one though have big brushes under the bottom making it hard to move across the rug
4,Fun for my Son!,Clearly easy to use my son drags this vacuum around everywhere. Even with his intensely rough use it has stayed in one peice with the exception of the roller falling out every couple of hours. It picks up and fluffs the carpet nicely too.
1,Bissell 2101B Sweep Up,"BISSELL 2101B Sweep-Up SweeperI bought this sweeper and it broke after 1 real use. The other time I used it was just to see if it picked up stuff. It did fine when just trying it out. Then I ran it across the carpet, and the middle brush fell out, and actually snapped off. We just bought it to pick up lint on my daughters new dark purple carpet, so for light use only, and it still broke. You get what you pay for, this thing is cheap. Then Plumstruck (SELLER) said it was past it's warrenty by 3 days, so they wouldnt give me a refund. That is how plumstruck treats its customers. If I were you, I would avoid them if possible."
1,terrible,"The sweeper came quickly and I was excited to try it upon opening. It seemed to work well my first two uses, but every use thereafter, the brush that rotates underneath to pick up dirt/dust would pop out completely. It's very hard to put back in once out, and after a couple of swipes across the ground it would pop out again. It's useless now."
1,Bissell Carpet Sweeper,This carpet sweeper is not what I expected it to be. It is difficult to push and pull and leaves ugly trail marks on the carpet.
1,u get what you pay for,enough said ..spend more or get stuck w/ this piece of junk..it came apart after 2 weeks & is unfixable..the brush part pops out EVERYTIME you make even one sweep w/ it ..after spending a half hour getting it back in ..it's not worth it
1,Disaster,"Don't buy this piece of junk. I took it from the box, assempled the handle and ran it over some pet hair.....several times, and ""lo and behold,"" the pet hair was still there.Next I ran it over some small shreds of paper that had fallen on the floor and it picked up about half of it and then proceeded to redeposit about half of that back onto the floor. I thought I'd give it one more chance and picked it up only to see the brush lying on the floor where it had fallen from the sweeper.I took the handle apart and threw the whole mess into the trash.I guess you get what you pay for."
1,"Terrible, brush pops out","The brush pops out and is difficult to put back in. When it is in, it marginally picks up anything and is moderately hard to push. Not only that, but the handle does not screw into the handle properly, so the top part falls off.Cheap price, cheap product."
1,I got an advanced copy of this book. Do not bother!!!,"Mary Higgins Clark can't need the money. I thought the Lottery Winner was awful. Then she wrote The Christmas Box and I thought ""Yikes, what drivel!. This NEW Holiday book is FAR and away her worst book and that is a distinction in of itself."
2,NOT ENOUGH,"I am a big fan of Mary Higgins Clark and I look forward to each novel she writes. I was very disappointed this time. We knew what was happening from the beginning not her usual twisting plot, page turning, keep you up all night suspense novel. I love Willie and Elvirah but it's time for something new. Are we getting lazy since the marriage??"
3,hope it all ends well type of book,"If you are looking for a murder, dead body, guts spilling type of mystery, look somewhere else, this is more a fairy tale happening in New York city type of mystery. Includes an abandoned baby, a building and a will, a criminal, and the one who raised the baby. Also a priest, some nuns, and the biological mother of the baby among others.It is charming and an easy to read novel. No true suspense, but more of a hope it all ends well type of book. You are left to wonder how can there be people like that; stealing a baby, wanting to use the little girl for money/drug dealings, a couple doing everything in their power to take a house away from a nun-run day care center, etc. Also there is the mystery of the missing chalice! But then you realize that we all have angels, and the only way that you can explain that this book has a nice ending is because of them.There are books which you think you will want to read again, this is not one of them."
1,Simply Lousy,"The plot is asinine, the characters unrealistic and how anybody could actually enjoy this book is a mystery to me."
4,All Through The Night by Mary Higgins Clark,Very pleased with the product. The book was in excellent shape inside and out. Received in a very short period of time. Would love to order again from this site.
3,All through the Night,"I wouldn't say it was her best work, but it was okay. Many things were very predictable. But it was clean and had a happy ending."
2,A 'Reader's Digest' Sort of Tale,"It seems as if M. H. Clark was 'made' to write a tale for Christmas by her editors. Her lack of enthusiasm is quite apparent by the lack of depth and intellect in this read. This book may appeal to the beginning reader, but it is very disappointing for others. Too simple, too predictable, too ho-hum, and does not grab the heart as I would have expected from Mary."
4,It was a good book,"Besides the fact that it confused me at the beginning of the book, after awhile, the book came all together towards the end and it made sense to me. It made me change the way l thought about how a women could abandon her child even though i still think its wrong to do such a thing. I like the way it ended how the mother and daughter reunited. If you enjoy a little mystery and a little happy endings you will enjoy this book very much, hopefully as much as I did."
2,All Through The Night,"I am an avid fan of Mary Higgins Clark, but I was extremely disappointed with this book. The beginning was worthy of a Clark novel, but quickly lost its momentum and became predictable -- something that I had not experienced before in a Clark novel. The storyline had potential; however, it quickly became dull and improbable. What a letdown!"
2,No Need to Stay Up All Through the Night,"Mary Higgins Clark should return to the style which made her famous. There is no twist, no suspense, no murder. Extremely predictable. If you want a human interest story, this is it. If you want suspense, look elsewhere."
3,One of her better efforts,"I have read several Mary Higgens Clark books, and although I've never been a real fan, I must say this book was one of the best. It was enjoyable in that it didn't have just the details about the main plot, but there were also several subplots, and, of course, they all came together to a very satisfying conclusion. I will agree with others that this is not typical MHC, it is better. It involves real emotion, not just suspense."
4,Beautiful Book,This book was beatiful and was a very easy read. It is great just before you go to bed. It is relaxing and takes your mind off of things.
3,A little slow,"The first half of the movie is really slow. Almost wanted to turn it off. Second half picks up a little more steam and makes movie a little more enjoyable. Not a great movie, but OK."
3,Good message but not a well-told story,The movie had a good message but the execution of the story was not compelling. The acting was adequate but not exceptional.
5,A Must see movie!,My daughter and I watched this movie together. I found it to be very moving. It opened a lot of doors for discussion with my teen daughter.
5,Incredible!,"Those who rate this movie badly are obviously incapable of seeing truth. This movie was a fiction story, but Gianna Jessen's story is much like this one and so it is not made up by the people who wrote it. Things like this actually do happen, which is why this movie is such a powerful movie. You will not be disappointed if you like movies that tell a true story and open your eyes to truth. Loved it and will definitely be recommending to all friends."
4,Very emotional.,This movie was both heartwarming and very emotional. The pain this girl went through was heart wrenching. It was also nice to see a movie filmed in a city that I actually know.
4,Good Movie - Problems with transmmission,The movie was good and my wife and I enjoyed it but it kept shutting down. This was very frustrating. I do no know if the fault was with amazon or ROKU. I am reluctant to order another movie through Amazon Movies since it was a bad experience. I have not had any previous problems with ROKU / Netflix transmissions up to that movie. Just FYI.
3,A Touching Story,"At nineteen years of age, Hannah (Rachel Hendrix) learns devastating news, leaving her with questions about her hidden past. Searching for answers takes her on an emotional journey.This film showed in theaters, but when I watched it on The Gospel Music Channel I felt October Baby was more like a made for television movie. It is a touching story that examines the abortion and adoption issues and teaches a lesson about forgiveness."
5,Excellent all the way around!,This movie was well made and very enjoyable to watch. The message was powerful and emotional. I think it will be an effective tool in revealing the devastation abortion causes.
5,Amazing!,"The best movie I have seen all year!! and I found it by accident. It's good to see a movie that has moral values, great characters(with character) , and a good story."
2,"Perhaps with better writers, actors, and a better story this movie could have been more interesting.","This movie wasn't great. The acting and dialogue were mostly unbelievable, and the plot was slow and predictable. I also think it's important to note that this is not a modern medical story. This is based on something that happened in the 70s. In medical terms, that's a long time ago. Because abortion procedures today are both legal and well-regulated, it is far-fetched that a freshman in college now would be the product of a botched abortion like this one."
3,Preachy,"I felt like the entire movie was pushing a morality story. The acting is ok, just the same sad facts kept being replayed. Did not care for it."
3,Poor dialog,I was expecting a better movie based on other people's reviews. The characters are contrived and the dialog is just nothing that people actually say.
5,Excellent,Great movie the wife and I enjoyed greatly Would recommend it to everyone looking for a good quality family movie
3,Good movie,Good movie. We found it to be a little slower than expected. We liked The Afters music that was in it.
1,hidden political agenda,The description of this film omits the fact that it was produced by radical right extremists who will stop at nothing to take away a woman's right to choose - don't be tricked into watching this film - it has a hidden political and emotional agenda that only becomes clear about halfway through the film.
2,Not what I expected,"I rented this because of all the great ratings. I wished I would have read them all first. The movie wasn't horrible, but like others have said, the acting was amateurish (the exception being Jasmin Guy in the Nurse Mary role, which was quite good), and the plot was meandering. I also felt manipulated, so wanted to give others a heads up about the movie. Some will love it, but for many, the ""message"" is heavy-handed."
2,Very disappointing,"I should preface this review by saying I have no problem with the political slant of the movie, which is pro-life. Having gotten that out of the way, this is one of the worst movies I have downloaded from Amazon. The story line was barely believable. The relationships, especially between Hannah (Rachel Hendrix) and Jason (Jason Hurley) and Hannah and her father (John Schneider) were stereotypical, one-dimensional and generally awkward. The acting on the whole was surprisingly amateurish, including Schneider. I have rarely been so cognizant during a movie of actors simply reading their lines. Much of the discredit must go to the Erwins, who produced, directed and provided the screenplay; they certainly didn't give the actors much to work with. I really wanted to like this movie. Two stars for being willing to take a stand on an issue that would never be seen in your average Hollywood movie. Not much else to recommend it. Sorry."
3,A quick and easy read,"I noticed this book when trying to find something to read on my kindle. The bok starts out with promise but let's you downin the end. Almost like the author ran out of time and had to finish the story. I feel as though the author had a really good opportunity to move the audience and just sort of fell flat. It's a predictable book, and I made my prediction in the beginning of what was going to happen (not consciously) and was actually disappointed when it didn't even satisfy my bland prediction.This book is definitely for a hard core Christian because they already accept everything that Christianity teaches them. For someone on the fence, though, it fails to bring the ""Miricle"" factor home. All in all an easy read that entertains the mind but is fairly underwhelming."
1,Mediocre pro-life propaganda,"This is a mediocre pro-life propaganda. I guess, the director wanted viewers to burst in tears from a number of biblical sunshine episodes and teens demonstrating abstinence and all around right father even if he behaves as a teenager. Waste of time and money."
3,Good Acting,"The actors especially the female lead did a good job. They were very believable; however I didn't know that this was an anti-abortion movie when I watched it. I am anti-abortion; but I didn't want to watch a movie about it. I like to be entertained when I watch a movie. If you want to see a movie that is anti-abortion, then this is a good one."
4,good movie,"I liked this movie... can't quite define why I can't 5 star it other than I don't have that internal ""wow"", but definitely a movie worth watching."
5,october baby,Great film that gives you a new perspective on life! Heavy in content but very enjoyable! My husband even enjoyed it :)
2,"The story is intriguing, but...","I can't totally recommend this movie. The actors, with the exception of Jasmine Guy and Shari Rigby, are not very good and several scenes just don't ring true at all. I think the theme of forgiveness is the movie's strongest point. If you are interested in a movie concerned with every life being beautiful, I would recommend the infinitely superior ""Bella""."
5,"Moving, Spiritual and one of the best I've seen 2012",I am an older lady that lived thru these times and by God's wonderful Grace I personally did not have to battle with the decision that this young girl's mother did. I certainly held friends hands when they made the choice for either abortion or to give up their child for adoption. I can tell you some of my friends are still haunted by those memories. But the main powerful most incredible story is Forgiveness.....We need more of it everyday & all walks of life. Their is alot of pain in this story but oh soooooooooooooo much love. Thanks for creating such a story!
1,Well it's obviously a religious film. Poor acting due to weak script,This film should be in a religious category so you know what you'll be watching. Extremely weak script about a subject that could have been done much better togive the topic justice on fim. Why it was rated 4.5 stars is beyond me.
1,Not good,"We wanted this to be good since we love adoption but the acting was not good, the writing was contrived and they never really figured out what identity they were going for: evangelistic? Or preaching to the choir?"
2,Mediocre Acting/Poorly Written,The movie is not horrible but is very predictable and some of the acting is amateurish. The story itself is okay but the movie is mainly a message about abortion.
1,boring,"Weak plot, undeveloped dialog, cute in an insulting way. BAD movie. I would not even waste the money to rent this movie."
4,october baby,This was a well done movie and clean. It addresses a current issue for life and is realistic. The acting and overall cinematography was well done. Thank you for an enjoyable movie.
4,A masterful work or storytelling and art,"This film is just that, a film. A true work of art. From lighting to camera angles, the movie is a masterpiece!The Characters are amazing, the moral and story is convicting, and the acting is hollywood quality.I have nothing more to say about this film other than a truly GOOD christian film that resonates with the spirit and will convict many.It is worth the money and time. To the director, producer, and all the cast. Props to you. You did a good job here."
3,Sweet story-- decent acting/writing,"This is a lovely movie. The message is beautiful. But the writing and the acting is not 'normal' Hollywood standards. The pro-life message is obvious and not subtle, but it still provides good thought-provoking discussions."
1,This is a CHRISTIAN movie with a STRONG Anti-Choice and Abstinence ONLY message!!!!!,This movie is simply what my title reads. This is Christian propaganda shrouded in a movie format. There are two fundamental messages: anti-choice and abstinence ONLY. There are college students in this movie that on a road trip the boyfriends sleep in a separate room and the girlfriends share a room together. There isn't ONE SINGLE kiss in the entire movie despite there being a secondary storyline of a love story between two college students. Nothing wrong with any of this but I for one do not appreciate the underhanded way of luring me into the movie to hit me over the head with the propaganda. I think the directors and writers should me honest in the description and I am sure there will be PLENTY of Christians that will choose to watch it. I do not appreciate being lured into this blatant dogmatic sermon for anti-abortion/choice and abstinence on my time and $$$.
1,disappointing propaganda,"This movie was very amateurish, unbelievable, long, and boring. There was no real emotion and very little character development for most of the supporting characters. The average Amazon rating of 4 stars was very deceiving."
1,"Bad, Really Bad",This movie is so bad it replaces my prior all-time worst movie ever buckaroo bonsai. Run run run away from this movie.
5,Remembering NOLA Express,"What a wonderful surprise to find this beautiful book while searching the internet for information on New Orleans during the period I lived there, 1970-72. I am writing a memoir about the Sixties, and this book is a real gem. Of course, I knew Darlene Fife, the author of ""Portraits from Memory,"" and Robert Head as publishers of the notorious ""NOLA Express"" bimonthly, but I was a political radical and kept my distance from the counterculture. Reading Darlene's memoir, I realized how truly radical she and the paper were, and also remembered how supportive they were to me, however unappreciative I was at the time. I recommend the book to anyone who cares about literature, free speech, the sixties and the undereground press, early environmentalism, New Orleans, the nuts and bolts of community organizing, and anyone who appreciates a beautifully produced book from a small regional press that deserves support."
1,Was There,"How surprised I was in searching for items regarding Jim DeGraff that I found this book, how funny it is to see Clarks name in print. I was one of those with Good News and have several copies of it and NOLA Express, artifacts of my past, haven't read this book yet but have ordered and am looking forward to reading it."
5,"Now More Than Ever, Buy & Read This!","Let's see: A materialistic, smugly self-satisfied culture, spying on its own citizens; a nation stuck in a useless war; young people searching for meaning in a culture that discourages non-conformity. Sound familiar? It should because that was then (the period of this book) and NOW. Everything recounted in this book has a current parallel and after reading it, you will ask, as I did: Why haven't we, as a nation, learned anything? This is recommended for any Gen X and Y folks who have been brainwashed into thinking the 60s Counterculture was some kind of error or mistake. Read, Learn, Act!"
5,Webster comes out Fightin'!,"Like previous editions of Webster's dictionary, this one has pretty pictures, and definitions of most of the words used in the English language. A must read."
1,Misleading description,"The phrasing of the product description makes it sound like you get the physical dictionary (a book) WITH the CD-Rom and online subscription. In reality, all that came was the CD-Rom and online subscription information."
1,Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary,"This dictionary was not made for ereader use, or if it was how to use it on such a device is not described."
4,Very useful reference.,Still a valuable reference. It was imcluded on my required book list when I was a college freshman over 50 years ago and I continue to use it (in updated editions) to this day.
4,Nice for book collector,"If you are looking for a dictionary to go along with a leather bound book collection - this will fit the bill. Not as nice as my other leather bound books, but fits in. If you are just looking for an everyday ""working"" dictionary - save the money and buy a regular cover one."
1,Dictionary,"the type was so small, that you can't even read it without a magnifying glass. I wont' be able to use it and I'm not THAT old."
1,Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary,I cannot find a usable keyboard to alphabetically find information. The review of the product was misleading. Perhaps someone could provide information as to how to make use of this dictionary.
5,WORDS FOR WISDOM,EVERYONE NEEDS TO ADD WORDS TO THEIR VOCABULARY - IT'S QUITE FUN LEARNING AT THIS OL' AGE. THE BOOK IS NICE AND BRIGHT AND CAN EASILY BE FOUND IN YOUR BOOK CASE.
4,Merriam-Webster dictionary,"This is a good resource to have at home, both for younger children and adults. It is very easy to use and a time saver."
2,DICTIONARY,"I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THIS DICTIONARY WAS NOT INDEXED. IF THIS HAD BEEN POINTED OUT IN THE DESCRIPTION, I NEVER WOULD HAVE ORDERED IT. IT COULD HAVE SAVED US BOTH TIME AND MONEY."
5,THIS BOOK IS GREAT,"This item was wicked awesome. It covered all the words I was looking for. Also, when I was watching the Scripps Spelling Bee Championships I could easily find the words. If there were more stars allowed to be given I'd give 10 stars."
4,Nice Dictionary,"This was purchased to keep in my diningroom for a scrabble game between my grandson, age 10, and myself. It is a good dictionary for quick reference and spelling."
2,Content great; binding cheap.,"This, with the Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged, is the authoritative academic reference dictionary and it shows. The definitions are more than glosses; they accurately describe the word and provide context. However, the binding detracts from the seriousness of the dictionary. It's cheap. What is more, I ordered a new volume but the cover had scrapes under the dust jacket. I won't send it back but I'm not happy with it.This next comment is not about the product per se: the shipping was horrible. It should have arrived on April 28th, from Prime 2 day shipping. It arrived on April 30th. It was sent FedEx instead of UPS and the tracking was sparse. This makes the scrape on the cover less tolerable.Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition"
3,wrong pronunciation found,Entry 'fire' has wrong pronunciation in this 11th edition. I really want new edition of the book without any errors.
2,too bad it doesn't work for ipod or itouch,"a fine dictionary indeed (I downloaded it on my pc with the Kindle for PC application) but too bad that I can't download it to my itouch... strange, since other dictionaries (like Oxfords ones) can be installed without any problem on an ipod."
5,"MW Collegiate Dictionary, 11th ed.","Being a long-time user of earlier editions of this dictionary, it was my choice when I purchased it for my grandson as a gift.He is using it, which was the point. An easy to use source, reference, and means of growing his language proficiency.I recommend it highly."
3,Words left undefined,I think there are many unnecessary pages in this dictionary that could have been replaced by more definitions and more words. I've had about a 60 percent chance of finding the word I need defined in this book.
2,A problem on the Kindle Fire,"I had hoped to use this dictionary to look up words. But it doesn't let you search for words, only locations.. So it doesn't really function as a stand alone dictionary. Had I known I would not have bought it."
1,Kindle version horribly Insufficient,"I downloaded it and found it horribly insufficient: the dictionary is worse than the OED which comes standard with the kindle, and the thesaurus is sparse and offers only a handful of synonyms for each entry. And it often has synonyms for only one definition of a given word, and as we know English has many, many different meanings attached to a single spelling. Very disappointing; I will return it now."
1,Kindle version is heavily abridged,"The print dictionary contains extensive grammar notes at the beginning and end, as well as more detailed word entries. Not only that, but the search - which would be the only redeeming feature - is utterly useless. For example, it returned the word ""Bazaar"" when I searched for the acronym AAR.DON'T BUY IT!Merriam Webster, this is a disgrace. The next time you release a dictionary on Kindle, either release the entire dictionary or clearly mark it abridged."
1,Very Disappointed,"This electronic dictionary is not the same as the print dictionary. The dictionary does not have guide words on top of each page. It's very misleading for the publisher to have this electronic version that looks like a print version, but is not."
2,Merriam -Webster's Collegiate Dictionary,I recent perchased this dictionary and found it is almost impossible to read. I then had to get a magnifying glass to see the smallest print letters I had ever seen. Everyone has this problem in my house not just people who wear eyeglasses. I think this is a huge drawback that I have seen. So I don't know if the definitions are good or not yet. I think I will have to get a paperback and try my luck with a less heavy book to carry around as well.
2,Not searchable,"I did not like the Kindle version of the dictionary. With a paper dictionary, you can quickly turn to the section you need, but with the Kindle version, you have to flip through hundreds of pages. You can't type in a word and have the dictionary go to that section. It's so cumbersome, we have never used it. I'm sorry I spent the money, especially when there are several online dictionaries that are easily searchable."
2,Navigation difficulty,Seems extremely difficult to go right to a word you wish to study. Or even to the section where one might find the word according to spelling. Maybe I missed the road but I saw no signs.
5,Great!,So glad I decided to buy it on my kindle. It's nice that I don't have to carry a giant book in my backpack and am able to carry just my iPad.
2,Merriam-webster's,"Needs work, thought that should have a clear search bar. Hard to use for class. Do not recommend for college students"
1,Please be aware that the stars shown here does not apply to the kindle version,"In light of the other comments (esp. those of 1 star) about the kindle edition, the stars shown here are misleading to those of us who are really interested in the kindle edition of the dictionary, which has been found to be markedly different from the printed paper edition.My 1 star comment here is only trying to balance out the misleading rating shown here."
1,"Heard of the Internet, anybody?","I would only pay money for this if the dictionary automatically updated for every edition--at no extra cost. If that were the case, I could see myself spending $10 to have an essentially free resource in a convenient new format. Otherwise, forget it."
3,Dictionary,We needed this for our 7th grader's reading class. It had to be this name brand and we decided to use the online option to buy it since it is cheaper than the stores were in our area.
5,Really Good Dictionary,"This is a really usefull item for people learning English and for the expansion of your vocabulary. I highly recommended it. It has a variety of sections such as geographical and Historical names and general words, its in alphabetic order with tabs on it."
5,Brand New Dictionary,It came brand new as expected. Needed the dictionary for a class and it is very useful. You get what you order with no surprises.
4,Reviewer Error,The previous reviewer mentions that this particular Edition includes a CD-Rom but it does not. There is an Edition that does have the CD-Rom but it is under a different description. There is a link above these comments that will take you to that site.
2,"Not helpful at learning and retaining words, absolutely nothing compared to the Oxford Dictionary","Do yourself a favor and get the Oxford Dictionary instead. Will be much easier to actually remember new words, this one does a poor job of creating any kind of image in your mind to associate with the word. Also, mostly vague definitions."
2,Good Dictionary Bad Tabs,I liked the dictionary but was highly dissapointed to see that the tabs do not start at the start of the letter. why would you have tabs and not put them in the right place. it sucks.
2,Merriam-Webster' Collegiate Dictionary,It is ok I had some difficulty in finding something's I was looking for. It would be nice if they had a Easter way to look up what your looking for. It took me to long. Sorry.
1,Satanic Bible,"The most detrimental book in existence and Satanic by, ironically, definition.Language is the most influential tool in mind control. Language is the external expression of reality as a personal paradigm and supplanting one's language into another is to manipulate the person into experiencing only what you allow.Looking up the definition of a word is like unto sitting in a mass being given in a language foreign to you and being denied the opportunity to experience the Bible yourself. It is dogmatic, outdated and laughableThe dictionary is the bible of the spineless communicator.The most empowering moment one can experience is to use a word ""incorrectly"" in a sentence, be corrected, and not care. That is enlightenment. That is transcendence. That is the epitome of the phrase ""ignorance is bliss"" because ignorance is not the state of unknowing but of truly living the truth of your own reality (these concepts, truth and reality, obviously not being one in the same.)"
4,Very pleased,"Based on reviews of others, I decided to order the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary. My son in high school has been very pleased. We have discovered that a few of your more basic words are missing. (This is the only thing that stops me from rating it at 5 stars.) You may want to keep one of the 'cheap' dollar store versions as a back-up for these words. It is well worth the investment. You could easily spend just as much on 3 or 4 other dictionaries and still not get what you need."
4,DICTIONARY,It works for me and it would be even greater if it was in a large print for those of us who need this feature.
1,misrepresented,"The description said that the dictionary included a cd with a one-year subscription to the on-line dictionary, the on-line thesaurus & an on-line Spanish-English dictionary. This is simply not true.I brought this issue to Amazon's attention. Last year I purchased a Webster Dictionary from Amazon with the full set of info. Apparently, this dictionary is a newer edition, but Amazon used the old dictionary description for this edition & the new edition does not contain the full set of info. At first we thought it was a shipping problem, but after receiving three incomplete orders from three different vendors on Amazon, Amazon realized their error. Since the dictionary code for the new edition dictionary is the same regardless of vendor, the escription is incorrect for all vendors. Hopefully this issue has been corrected, but it was too late for me."
3,Not a large print dictionary,"Although this is listed in Amazon as a ""large print"" dictionary, it's not. No knock on the dictionary, it's just not large print."
5,My favourite reference book,"I acquired my first Merriam Webster's dictionary when I was 17. It was completely by chance, because at that time I didn't know much about reference books. It has followed me through my English studies (English is not my first language), I've translated hundreds of pages using it instead of a bilingual dictionary, and it has always been reliable, up-to-date and fun to use. I am an English teacher now, I have used many other dictionaries of similar kind, but none of them ever matched my Merriam Webster. Now I have the eleventh edition with CD, which means I'm starting my own collection of the Collegiate series.I'd recommend it to everyone because it's exhaustive but simple to use at the same time. Not many other dictionaries can match it."
2,Good Dictionary but Working Badly for Kindle (rating for Kindle version),"Undoubtedly it's a great dictionary in the paperback sense, but when I bought its Kindle version for my Kindle DX, it greatly disappointed me.Most people purchase dictionaries in Kindle versions for the integration with Kindle reading, but this dictionary fails to show definition in an acceptable format while reading a Kindle book. For eg., if you look up ""devisive"" it normally reads like""devisive /xxx also xxx or xxx/ adj ... "" (xxx stands for pronunciation symbols)but when you look it up while reading, the definition skips all xxx parts and reads like""devisive also or adj ... ""which does not make any sense.I strongly suggest a thorough review or reform of the format or Kindle-reading experience before any ""Kindle-integrated"" version of dictionary being published and sold."
3,No pronunciation,"Excellent dictionary. The whole thing is on a CD. I bought this because my old CD, American Heritage, got damaged when my disk drive went. Merriam-Webster does not have pronunciation. I emailed the company. They told me that the CD in the dictionary was version 3, and version 4 has pronunciation. They emailed me version 4 and the unlock code. Unfortunately, as soon as I type in a single letter, the program crashes. It is useless. I corresponded back and forth, with no success. I am sure the programmers there are cheap Indian programmers, unable to write a simple code for pronunciation. American Heritage did this years ago. In their email correspondence, they did not even know proper English. This is for programmers working for a dictionary company!I gave it 3 stars, as it is a good dictionary. However, had I known that there was no pronunciation, I would not have bought it. It does not pay to return the item."
1,Misrepresentation,"The dictionary was described as having a Kivar binding with jacket, hardcover, but it had a soft cover. I had to pay for shipping both ways. This was an irritating experience."
1,Incomplete description,"This edition of Webester's Collegiate Dictionary ""book only"" does not have alphabet tabs. Amazon's description does not specify that it does have tabs ---- no is there anything about tabs on the edition with the CD Rom. Befor ordering I called customer service and the person who took my call could not give me an answer regarding alphabetic tabs --- I took a chance and ordered, both the customer service rep and I assumed that all distciontary's had the tabs. Beyond the failure to describe the book fully and the inability of the customer service representative to find the information when questioned the book arrived promptly and in good condition. I"
5,The real thing!,"This is a great, serious dictionary with accurate defnitions and good example sentences showing how the definitions are used. It also gives believable derivations that don't leave me wondering how in the world the word could have come to mean what it does today, but aid in conveying the concept of the word. It carries some definitions that are in current use, but are not included in comparable dictionaries offered by Oxford, Random House, Encarta or Funk & Wagnals, for example."
1,worthless,this does not include any words that arent in the standere kindle dictionary. like i stated in the title it is worthless
1,surely you are joking,"I ordered the item in your communication except with a CD included. The CD never showed up. You then sent a replacement with exactly the same result. After I called Amazon I was informed that you were out of the advertised item. I was then informed via email, to which no reply was allowed, twice, that I would be charged for the item and its replacement I can see that we will be having a battle royal with the credit card company as there is no way on God's green earth that I will pay anything for such absolutely lousy customer service.Richard F. O'Brien"
4,Worth the price!!,"Excellent reference. Type is a bit small, but otherwise full of helpful information."
3,Half a loaf is better than none.,"The paper half of this package is a good dictionary, but the computer program is a little quirky. The online ebook version is both better and free. On the other hand the free online version does not come with a printed version, and Amazon doesn't sell it either."
1,Horrible,Why can't I just search a word have to look through the whole damn book. Do not buy. Hard cover dictionary is easier then using this
3,Not extensive enough for my needs,"Some older words are not included. When composing some of my diatribes about current news events, and need assistance in the spelling of some ""old"" words, they are not found in this dictionary. I must go back to my older dictionary for those. I was disappointed; I also do crosswords puzzles and looking up words are not always found in this dictionary. Perhaps, I ordered the wrong version, but thought that the ""collegiate"" edition was most suitable. My mistake."
2,Print not large enough,I thought I was buying a large print dictionary and this one was not. I have difficulty reading it. It would be OK for someone who doesn't have eye problems.
3,it's a dictionary,it serves its purpose. i think i prefer oxford over M-W. Oxford gives definitions and examples based on the most common usage of the word. Webster traditionally gives it by historical precedence. You may find yourself using an dated definition for a word in public and feel silly after word.
3,Merriam-webster Collegiate Dictionary:,"This Merriam-webster Collegiate Dictionary: Luxury Leather Bound by Merriam Webster is an updated version of a much earlier edition I own. Although I appreciate the addition of new words that have been added to the language, this version lacks maps and other world facts and figures, charts, etc. from the 7th edition."
2,Not a good replacement for the kindle.,"I bought this dictionary as a replacement on my Kindle. I'm sorry I did. It did not find as many words as the default dictionary Mand a lot of the ones that it did find, I had to go to the full screen few to see the definition. I switched back to the default dictionary. You are not allowed to download the dictionary to an iPhone either. I download it to my pc thinking that I could use a newer Collegiate dictionary. There is no table of contents, so I will not use it on my pc either."
5,Great reference tool!!,"I write historicals, and needed to look up the date of origin of a word. I had no idea that the dictionary I'd been using didn't include that information, so I immediately looked for one that did. After all, shouldn't every author own a comprehensive dictionary? My Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary-11th Edition arrived yesterday, and I love it! It lists the date of origin of each word--a must-have feature if you're writing historical, or judging another's writing, as I've also done in the past. By the way, the word ""bubbly"" came into use in 1599, so I'm good to go with it in the early 1800s. :-)"
4,It is what it is...,I purchased this dictionary knowing full well that it was used. Came in the condition that the seller stated on Amazon.com. I would buy from this seller again...
5,Merriam Websters Collegiate Dictionary,"It pays to buy the 'real thing' and not paperbacksand school district and college 'throw aways' whoseversions of the English langage were okay fifty yearsago but, not now? Amazon has it for more than a affordableprice and the finished product will last till you've forgottenhow to read?"
4,great dictionary,This is a great dictionary. I wish they would make one just like it in large print and soft cover.
5,The Best Dictionary,I've been using this dictionary since 1963. I've probably had five or six editions since then. I'm pretty sure I paid less for the 11th edition from Amazon than I paid for my first Merriam-Webster way back then.
4,Wonderful Book!,There is a lot of wonderful information packed inside this little book. It is worth the investment to see how color actually affects our everyday lives.
2,"Sound good,, but buy them cheap","Sennheiser is one of the better known names in headphones. Their sound quality is excellent. I thought that their wireless headphones would be excellent as well. They were, for about 6 months. Then they just stopped working. No clues to the problem. Possibly the battery?"
1,One of the Worst ever wireless headphones...,"there is an hell lot amount of NOISE...only...with the model. Please dont go for this model.... I dont know how to part this piece to trash.,..."
3,Book Review,"I chose to write a 3 page book review on this book for my history class. My over all assessment is that its great for historians, but not for the average reader. There is a ton, and I mean a TON, of information in here, and the author includes everything he can. The problem for the average reader however, is that that information can get boring, very boring, and end up with no knowledge gained.So if you want to read this book, be prepared to indulge."
4,"Well written, easy flow, yet complex twists","Intelligent story based upon the search for amber panels missing from Russia since WW II.Nice plot twists that involve CIA, Politburo, European aristocracy and others searching for the amber room. Along the way art dealers, ex KGB agents, and NYC cops get involved.Descriptive writing carries the reader from NYC to Moscow to Europe effortlessy. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and knocked it down to 4 stars only because I would have liked to have seen more extensive character development. However, the book was a great read, and I didn't set it down until I finished it.Hope to see more soon from this talented author, and hope as he matures as a writer we will see more development of his characters.Highly recommend this book and eagerly await his next work."
1,"Interesting idea, painfully amateurish writing","The heading basically says it all. An interesting concept with some interesting characters, but the writer tries so hard to use colorful, complex language that you just space out trying to follow it. Way too impressed with its own cleverness."
1,Seizing Amber Blows,"Aside from the Amber Room itself being an interesting piece of history, the narrative of this book is overblown and unrealistic, while the writing itself is wooden."
4,Buy an electric pump,"Step one: purchase an electric pump along with this bed. You will thank me.I spent waaaaay too long the first time I used this bed, pumping it up with the tiny plastic hand-pump that is included in the box.It's torture.Before I used it again, I bought an electric pump.As far as the bed goes, I have no complaints so far! It's got a satin-y finish on it that keeps you from slipping around.I'm 6'3"", and 200 pounds and it seems to be quite durable."
5,Perfect,"I found the mattresses perfect, I bought two and used them all the time. I just move and did not have proper beds or mattresses and after 2 weeks are working perfect. The lousy part is when I had to inflate them, not automatic system for me but still did not take long. Im really pleased. Thanks X10"
5,comfortable airbed,"Its really comfortable and it retains air for a long time. I only pump once a week for like a minute which in real sense is not so necessary, its just that i personally like it very strong."
3,Not the best option,"I bought this product and Coleman's. Coleman's is better in my opinion; it has much better pattern, which allows one to sleep better, and user friendly system of letting the air out. It took me 1 minute to let the air out of Coleman, and 20 minutes of hard work to get it out of this. They are both somewhat uncomfortable, but this one a lot more so due to highly anti ergonomic pattern. The positive side of it is a better air pump."
1,You get what you pay for. Learned a lesson today.,"Item looks great. But check it out when you get it to see if it holds air. Went camping 5 weeks after we purchased this item. Wound up sleeping on the ground. Tried blowing it up several times. Was not a fun night. Used a spray bottle of soapy water in it to try to find the leak, Nothing. I guess the leak is to small to track. Mattress stays inflated for about 2 hrs, before you hit the ground. Return Policy 30 days on products sold on Amazom. Lesson learned! Check out each and every thing you buy, make sure there is a return policy available that suits your needs. Guess we are just out of the money, we will buy another at Walmart, even though I don't like doing business there, a no hassel return policy there for up to a year, can't beat that."
1,Slow Leak,"I used the mattress twice for overnight use for two people. The first time by the morning there was noticeably less air in the mattress. The second time I used it, I had to refill the mattress every three hours. I thought it might be the valve, so I tightened it with a pliers to get it tight, it still leaked somewhere. I threw it away after the second use."
2,Pain in the Butt,"The manual pump takes a ton of effort to blow up, not fun when you're tired and ready for bed. I had to buy a seperate air pump for convinence and it doesn't fit correctly and kills batteries, but thats another story. It frequently deflates over night and I wind up sinking to the floor by morning. The pillows are a joke, I have this one as a spare, just in case bed. You're better off getting the more expensive one with a built in air pump, I thought I was being smart saving money, I rather have paid."
4,excellent quality - larger than expected,"The bed is larger than expected. A true queen size. The hand pump was a bit of a work-out, but I need to hit the gym more anyway. The mattress stays full for a long time. Only giving 4 stars because we've only used it a couple times. If it lasts, I'll change it to 5 stars."
3,Good for 3 months,"If you would just like to use this occassionally, it is a very good bed. Otherwise, this is just a toy.. in exactly three months of almost daily use, it bursted when i was sleeping!! Now am using it as a carpet..."
3,Great item,"I bought this bed 3 days ago. It looks very nice, and very comfortable except its strong plastic smell.Anyway, Just $29.99.Good price!However, it's broken now(4 month later)!"
4,Perfect for one or two days,"It's okay for one or two days, no more than that. Looks very good and easy to inflate. I don't think airbeds are made to sleep long periods, if that is what you want, you better get something else."
3,"cheap airbed, perfect for guests or as temporary bed","The airbed is ok. It works just fine, but the airbed bumpy pattern (on the sleeping side) does not make the airbed very comfortable and the airbed feels cold. However, by adding a thing mattress-pad, the airbed is much more comfortable; the mattress-pad does not make you feel much of the bumpy pattern and the airbed does not feel cold.The airbed is perfect for guests or as temporary bed."
1,poor quality,well just took my air mattress camping...spent the night between 3 rocks... i felt them all as the mattress deflated after 20 mins ... the stitching around the air vent was made so poorly you can hear the air escape. Returning policy makes any kind of return useless as you will spend more money shipping it back to the seller. Buy something better...
3,It works... but the pump is cheap,"Okay, so it works okay. I think it lost some air during the night. My main complaint is with the ""Hand-pump"". It kinda feels like it might break in your hand... it didn't. But not sure it will last."
1,No thank you,"DISSAPOINTMENT right out of the box it leaked...placed it on a clean flat floor,plugged in the air, and it leaked.THUMBS DOWN"
5,"Great product, but have some words of advice!","This product was of a great quality; however, I do have some advice to share. Do not use the tips, but just use the end of the air pump line in order to air the airbed in a reasonable amount of time. Glad to buy this product from Amazon.com. This product does what it is suppose to! I recommend this product. -@eplusq"
1,The pump did not work.,I couldn't get the bed inflated so it was a total waste of money. I thew it out. Don't waste your $.
