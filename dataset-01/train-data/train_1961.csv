2,overdone,"I understand there is racism in America but this movie kind of overdid it. For example that one black guy that released the chinese prisoners in the bus for most of the movie talked about how bad racism was and how horrible it was being black without drawing breath. It is ok to make a movie about this issue but when that is the only subject that ever comes out of the characters mouths it gets overbearing, unrealistic, and annoying."
1,"Boring, obvious, hackneyed","Everyone good is bad, everyone bad is good. Nothing turns out how you are supposed to expect.I detested it. I have never done drugs and I am British. I couldn't believe how transparently obvious this film was. You are supposed to be judgmental and go along with the characters then you get this big surprise. If that's not your world view then this is an artless tour round a set of bad attitudes.One of my friends loved it, thinks it's the best film ever. She has used coke and is from LA."
2,Not What I Expected...,"Seriously, when I went to see Crash at the theater, I expected something different. What I got was a story about racism, drugs, rape, inter-racial sex, and more. I don't remember too much because I haven't seen it since. I wouldn't recommend CRASH!!!"
1,Brokeback Mountain is 1000x times better than Crash,"Who cares about a piece of metal called Oscar. Brokeback Mountain is so much better than Crash. It has nothing to do with Gay or Straight. It has to do with the quality of the movie. Brokeback Mountain is the greatest piece of work to ever grace the silver screen. It is not a movie, its an experience. Crash on the other hand is actually one of the worst movies ever made. How dare the Academy honor them!"
2,Extremely over-rated,"There's some good acting and some sharp dialogue, but by the end of the film the constant and overwhelming weight of bizarre coincidences was too much for me. What is the population of LA? 50 people? It must be, the way these people keep running into each other and having their dramatic little moments."
1,Absolutely hated it.,What can I say? It was so negative but perhaps there is some need to show this type of movie.
4,The ugliness and goodness in people.,The ugliness and goodness in people and the dichotemy of good and evil in every person is portrayed very nicely. Would you be able to rise to the occasion?
3,It Was Just One of Those Movies,"Not all that entertaining, it is well produced and directed, the acting is good but the story is one of those 6 degrees of separation and becomes convoluted at times. I suspect if you like racially fueled movies then you will love this one because its all about the bias in America . When I watch a movie I want to be entertained not schooled in one persons ideal of what is right/wrong and hope for a happy ending that never comes from lessons learned. That's not a spoiler alert, because it implies the movie has a happy ending, far from it. It's an impossible movie to rate for someone else to watch because you never know what a strangers politics are, so watch for yourself and decide. If you're looking for fun and light hearted then you'll want to take a pass. If you like personal drama then grab your pop corn and immerse yourself."
4,Crash,I need to watch it again as it was quite some time ago that I purchased this movie will remark later
2,Trite,All the ethnic cliches you can think of rolled into one movie. I found it really boring and was grateful it ended.
1,Best Picture? -- No Way,"This TV-like drama on racism in LA is saved from banality by some fine performances by some of the actors. The problem lies in the contrivances of the plot that makes not entirely credible connections between characters who might not otherwise meet. Another weakness is the way the characters spell everything out--no mystery here about how they feel because what they say out loud is all there is--no underlying mystery or nuance. By supposedly offering a take on the racist tendencies in all of us, the film manages to offer a number of racial stereotypes. A disappointing choice for best picture, a way for Hollywood to congratulate itself. I originally rated this film with 2 stars but now that it was awarded the Oscar, I have given it 1 star for being ludicrously overrated by the Academy. It didn't even deserve screenplay--Good Night and Good Luck, Syriana, The Squid and the Whale were all better films. And editing? The Constant Gardener and Munich were more deserving."
2,Nothing to Write Home About,"This is another one of those ""it deserves an academy award because of the subject or the actor"". It does not depend on the quality of the content or the acting. Eastwood got it for Unforgiven because he had been around Hollywood a 100 years and was well liked. Halle Berry got it for Monsterball, a monster flop, and many critics stated it had a lot to do with her race/sex not performance. Crash is another such film. It addresses the politically correct issue of rascism and manages to get most of the key races into the movie Asian, Hispanic, Black, White, etc.. A sure winner, regardless of the quality of content. I'd say you'd have to go way out on a limb to believe that racial interrelations exist as those depicted in this movie but I can't imagine a limb that long."
1,NOT the best picture of 2005,"Well,well,well---the members of the Academy did it again. Awarded best picture to an inferior film over a extremely memorable and poignant one. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is heads and shoulders above this trite ""race issue"" TV movie of the week.I just wish for once the members of the Academy had ""the balls"" to reward ""THE BEST"" film for a change. Oh, yeah it's TOO controversial---the conservative sector might get upset and boycott the theaters. OOOOOOOOOOH GIVE ME A BREAK!!!!!!!Members of the Academy--you ought to be ashamed.You guys had a chance to make history----and you blew it!"
1,"Disappointment, Overall bad Film","I rented this movie with great excitement and hopes that it would be a very good film. Unfortunately, to my disappointment, it failed miserably. Right from the begining, it presses the whole multi-culutral theme, and tries much too hard to do so. The abundant use of profane racial slurs is repugnant. The acting is in my mind quite sub-par. The only positive about this movie is the good use of floating narrators to tell different stories the blend together. Besides this, the movie is a general disappoinment."
5,"a brilliant and unforgettable, blistering drama!","WOW, WAS I EVER FLOORED BY THE DVD OF 'CRASH'! ALL OF THE ACTING BY THE ENTIRE CAST GOES BEYOND BRILLIANT! EVERYONE IS SUPERB. I REALLY HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT HERE, BUT, THANKS TO BOTH ALL THE RAVE CRITICAL REVIEWS AND FROM THE RAVE REVIEWS HERE BY MY CO AMAZON READERS DEFINITELY INDUCED ME TO BUY THE DVD TODAY! IT IS BRILLIANT AND MAGNIFICENT, WITH A SCREENPLAY THAT IS SURE TO BE NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR! EACH SEGMENT WILL ASTOUND ALL OF YOU, AS IT DID ME-ASTONISHING. DVD WISE, THE CINEMATOGRAPHY AND THE DOLBY DIGITAL AC-3 SOUND EQUAL THE BRILLIANCE OF THE FILM! THIS ONE IS A REAL KEEPER, AND ONE THAT CAN BE WATCHED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SO VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
5,The Most Thought-Provoking Movie,"I would rank this movie as one of the very best that I've seen in years. How many movies present BOTH sides of a story in such a manner that it makes you wonder about your own perceptions? It seems to me that people who scored the movie very low are either extremely stubborn and don't want to ""walk a mile in some else's shoes"", just don't like to think while watching a movie, or living in a fantasy world where there are no problems. The whole point of the movie is that we stereotype cultures other than our own...so, of course, the characterizations are stereotypical!"
3,Six Degrees of Separation Revisited,"What is most intriguing about Crash is not its message about race relations, which doesn't provide any new insights on the topic. Nor is it the elevation of the automobile to a starring role, so appropriate to the way we lead our lives: all fifteen or so of the chief characters' lives are altered by cars in some way (mainly through accidents and thefts). Rather, what is intriguing about Crash is the intricate interconnection of all the characters in the ten or so seemingly standalone subplots. After I watched the DVD, I diagrammed it: I had twenty boxes indicating the fifteen main characters plus fie minor characters, and over thirty lines linking them all up. In fact, at the end of the movie the action has to circle back to the beginning so a key relationship can be revealed.If you watch this movie as a puzzle to be solved, you may enjoy it. If you try to relate to the characters or to look for new insights in its apparent messages, you may come up short."
2,BEST PICTURE?,"CRASH has its absorbing sequences, and as many reviewers have mentioned, it has more than passing resemblance to MAGNOLIA, which is superior in every way. The subject of race in today's America is certainly a noble subject to bring to life in a movie - the issue with this film is that it is didactic, completely predictable and way too clever to be even remotely believable. Each performer is given two specific qualities- their racist self and their human self. And just like a nifty puzzle, all of these sides come together in a rather absurd stew by the time we get to the ""revelations"" sequence at the end. The musical score and cinemtography are so purposely dramatic and harsh that they end up becoming overbearing. How on Earth did this forgettable, uninvolving movie EVER win Best Picture?"
3,disturbing,"This movie is not happy, enjoyable, or heartwarming in any way. Nonetheless it is a well done movie. For me it is not a movie I am glad I saw or one I would ever want to watch again. It left me feeling depressed and distressed, especially from some scenes invloving children. If you like movies that are so realistic to almost be viewed as documentaries, then this movie is for you. If not, go watch Amelie."
2,Whats the big deal?,"Was extremely dissapointed. Whats the big deal. I did not need a movie to showcase what racism was in America. It stares at your face everyday. So it was a damper on me.Well done film though i must say, but there was no punch in it for me."
2,Looks a bit like...,"Looks a bit like the American version of the English film ""Snatch""/2000. Nothing new, plot very predictable, I wouldn't advise this to anyone who is looking for a new plot form because it's been done. I'm frankly tired of remakes and this definetly falls in such a category."
4,Best Picture? Who's To Say,"I won't even bother to jump into the fray in debating whether ""Crash"" was a worthy winner of the Best Picture Oscar because I didn't see ""Brokeback Mountain"". For me the best films last year were in no particular order ""Walk the Line"", ""Cinderella Man"", ""Batman Begins"", ""Wedding Crashers"", ""Sin City"", ""Kung Fu Hustle"", Wallace and Gromit-Curse of the Wererabbit"", and ""Transporter 2"". There's certainly been worse choices for Best Picture with 2004's Paul Haggis scripted ""Million Dollar Baby"" coming to mind. The central premise of ""Crash"" which involves the convergence of persons of different socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds is not the most original of concepts. To the film's credit it is crisply directed and expertly plotted. The ensemble cast is uniformly excellent. I saw this film in the theatre and was engaged but not blown away. I will say that after seeing it on DVD it does hold up to repeat viewings. In conclusion I've seen better but you could do worse."
3,Rather Costly,"I used a Braun shaver for two years. It did a much better job than any Norelco I had used previously. I really enjoyed shaving with Braun. However, the weak spot of this shaver was the battery. It developed a ""memory"" despite the fact that I periodically discharged it completely in accordance with Braun's instructions. So as time went on, I had to recharge the battery more often. It finally died after two years of use. The battery is not replaceable so when it goes, so does the razor. Additionally, Braun recommends replacing the cutter and foil every 18 months. I did the math and decided the cost was too much, so rather than purchasing another one, I switched back to a regular razor."
4,The BEST for SHAVING YOUR HEAD!!,If you are shaving your head this product is the best! I have tried the rotary systems ..and traditional blade razors...this puppy is the best...I love it. It is also great on my face but nothing beats a blade on the old mug.
4,Excellent,"I used this on my 10/22 to give me a little more length of pull. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. It does need to be sanded to fit your rifle, so do get the jig, or have a gunsmith do it."
4,Fool's Errand,"Broad story of reconstruction in the south..Several soliloquies consider the political, social, and community realitiesof reconstruction policy that offers a current reader historical perspective."
5,Great Value!,"My fathers Dentist recommended these and I purchased one based on my fathers experience. This toothbrush cleans so much better than a regular brush and the timer helps me to stay on track with a 2 minute cleaning. After 2 minutes, the motor goes on and off a couple times then resumes operation to let you know time is up. The brush head is easy to get to tight spots and is very gentle.I am impressed. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a clean smile!Ryan"
4,Timer toothbrush is good- but does not last forever,"I bought this toothbrush first about 3 years ago. I think it works wonderfully, and the timer is a wonderful feature. It just stopped working a few days ago, so I am buying a new one. My only criticisms are that the replacement heads are somewhat expensive and that it stopped working after three years. Despite these problems, I strongly recommend this product."
1,manufacturer,"I notice that ""BRAUN"", the original German manufacturer is crossed out on the item!? Can someone tell me where and by whom it is made?"
4,Keeps on Going and Going and Going,I've owned this product for years and am now only shopping for another one because the battery is finally running out. I've had it for at least 7 years though. I read this earlier review and just wanted to let people know that it can last a very long time. I'm getting another one for sure.
5,The Best Quickdraw!,"The best biner/draw on the market. A high cost Superior design manufactured in England. It offers an advantageous Wiregate with a snagless design, the only one available on the market, and the best of both worlds. (there is one other, but it has problems with the gate design.) It is also the strongest biner on the market. Particularly the gate open strength. Some people tout the keylock solid gate for the top biner, others the bent gate lower biner. ( I used to as well, but no longer.) By far the best draw on the market and I have climbed with just about every draw available, including all the hybrid's."
2,Incomplete field guide for vacationing naturalist,"Includes multiple color photographs of certain species, and lacks any color photographs of ~1/3 of species described. Species lacking color photos are represented by black and white line drawings of head and in some cases the entire body. Would not recommend for a casual visitor to the region."
1,junk,"old standard that never took off. I hope no one attempted to develop legacy app using this architecture. Not even conceptually viable. Maybe work in a controlled lab or a very small development effort. But once many people are involved, you would never get everyone to adhere to strict concept like this. I hope it dies a quick death."
5,Great book!,"Great book for teenagers to read! This book will hold their interest, while at the same time learning great life lessons. Parents' should put this in their teens' hands as a great communication tool!"
1,Mars have flipped it,"Hey guys... i've been a fan for ages you know, but hey all the top things must stop after having so much momentum you know. yeah well i'm afraid that this one sucks fellas, but they are still alive, my god thats ok they can still make more better ones in the future. The planet is out of balance... lets accelerate mars back up again!! yeah. peace and bye bye"
1,Tank was broken upon arrival....DOA,"One tank did not work upon arrival. We had to pay to ship it back to the manuyfactor. Our 7 year old saved his allowance for it and was very let down. We think either a transimtter or a reciever was not working on one of the tanks. We have paid the additional shipping, and are awaiting our second shipment. I hope it works better this time."
3,A little slow in the video game age,"I bought this for my 13 year old. I originally was looking at the small remote control helicopters, but the reviews about them breaking on day 1 scared me off. I think these tanks are well built and will last. They just move a little slow. If you are out in the open, you have no chance of outrunning the other guys ability to turn his turret and nail you. So we both end up hiding behind the couch or table waiting for the other guy to move into the open and get killed. Maybe 8 to 10 year olds might enjoy it more."
3,it ok,for the price you can't cry to much they are fun but after you take 4 hits your tank is stopped and with ours sometimes it has to be turned off just to get going again. and on one of the tanks the track keeps coming off but we still play with them.and sometimes they just stop moving and you have to turn them on and off a couple of time.
4,Tanks a lot!,My grandson (and Grampy) went wild over this toy. It kept their attention longer than any other gift. Works well on carpet or bare floors. The ejecting looser was a great touch!
4,Fun toy,"I bought this for my 8-year-old son for Christmas and he liked it. Definitely not for outdoor use because the controlers are IR based, so direct sunlight can destroy the light-sensitive senors. But they're durable enough for indoor use."
3,"Cute idea, needs some revisions","Cute idea and decent price but,when a tank is ""hit"" it rotates and is inoperable for about 60 seconds... too long really before you can continue the battle... by the time you are ready to go again you are turned around and the other person is ready to hit you immediately again.the volume is too loud, more of an outdoor toy. It needs a volume switch to be used indoors.Overall a hit with the kids but frustrating to them because of the delay when hit, would be better for a teen."
1,Not as advertised,"Description of this toy says the size of the tanks are 12""x4""x4"". They are not, they are mini sized. Also, one tank did not work out of the box and the other tanks battery compartment screw is stripped (out of box). Returned."
5,TANKS,THE TANKS ARE GREAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE NOISE. THE NOISE CAN NOT BE CUT DOWN. 5 MONTHS AND STILL GOING STRONG I CANT BELIEVE THEY HAVE SURVIVED THIS LONG WITH MY TWO BOYS. I JUST WISH I COULD ADJUST THE VOLUME.
4,Fairly idiot-proof,"Although it makes the on-off action a little strange (until you get used to it) the best feature of this trimmer is the ""memory"" function which prevents it from switching on unless it is at your correct pre-set beard length. Having more than once given myself an unsightly shaved ""stripe"" up my chin during a sleepy trimming session, I value this feature highly. Other than that it trims efficiently and quietly, and comes with a rechargeable battery with automatic switchable voltage for travelling."
5,Got a Goatee? Get one of these...,"About a year ago, I decided to join the goatee crowd. After using a Philips trimmer and trying to use a Wahl beard trimmer- I was about to go back to being clean shaven.This unit is well made (even if it's made in China) and comes with a decent case. Battery life is excellent- I only have charged it probably 4 times. I trim almost every other day to maintain a shorter beard.The plastic length adjuster is solid and repeatable. Another reviewer indicated that it was cheap- compared to the Philips and Wahl- it's BMW quality.On another note- my son likes to have his hair shaved relatively short. He HATES the Wahl clipper we own and prefers to use the Braun trimmer."
5,Hydrogen Power Now !,"My teacher recommended this book to me to read this summer. I think someone knows who wrote it. I just finished it. I am not really into sci-fi, but I do like adventure stories. This book was fun to read and really made me think about the future and how stuff like electric cars can make hurricanes less powerful and the world better. I like that part of the story was in California where all the cool technology comes from and how you get to see the kids grown up and then be just kids again. I wish this counted as an AR book and since it has questions in the back, it sort of is. I hope to drive a hyrogen car someday. I saw a hydrogen powered bus at a parade and thought it was cool that it was only leaving water instead of fumes. BUY THIS BOOK."
5,THE definitive work on the subject,"If you want to know absolutely everything about chanting Torah, Haftarah, or one of the Megillot, this book is for you. Every special circumstance is discussed, every rule of reading is discussed and the history and evolution of how and why we chant the way we do today is discussed. It is a wonderful resource for those who teach trope."
4,Just what I was hoping for,This item was exactly as it looked and was exactly what I was hoping for. Is very sexy and erotic
2,Well...nice try...,"I really wanted to like this deck, and as far as the art is concerned I really, really do. Goregous art collages of one of my favorite places on earth seemed to be a sure hit with me. Alas, then I opened the box...The deck is printed on such cheap and flimsy cardstock, that it's almost impossible to shuffle without seriously bending or, worse yet, tearing it. I was horrified the first time I opened the set and saw the cheap quality of the cards. Bizarrely enough, the book that comes with the set is printed as a very nice hardbound book, and there's a pretty silk scarf included in the box also. I'd rather have a cheaper paperback book, not have the silk scarf, but have the deck printed on usable cardstock. Overall, this deck is going into the ""pretty and nice to look at but not usable"" part of my tarot card collection. I really feel like I wasted my money on this deck. Do not buy this deck if you are planning on trying to read with it."
5,tarot's next step,"Cheers to j. philip thomas for having the clarity and strength to bring needed change to the ever evolving tarot.Beyond the beautiful and inspired artwork, lies a brilliant and well thought out system and method...obviously the product of a labor of love. The new printing of the deck brings a higher quality card and color print (my old deck was getting worn), and given the many layers of meaning within the revolutionary artwork, it is highly appropriate and appreciated.Don't just use the cards, read about its foundation and check out the system that it arises from.You'll be amazed."
5,The Art Work is Incredible,"It doesn't matter if you have an interest in Tarot or Paris, either way you will not be disappointed. When we went to Paris, I took the deck with me and looked for the statues photographed. Worth every dollar I spent."
1,"disappointing, ugly, unusable deck","I was severely disappointed by this tarot deck. The card art shows collages of photos, which I find unappealing and poorly integrated (they look glaringly ""photoshopped"" and false). The cardstock is flimsy and low quality. Bad for divination; the symbolism seems forced, and many of the majors are distractingly renamed. Also, the cards are too big to handle easily (about 3"" x 5""). An ugly deck that is unusable. I am embarrassed to have purchased it."
4,Nice Album,"I really like this album. I can't understand it not getting the promotion it deserved. Not Too Far and Kiss You is the album's weight along. It behoofs me. At any rate, it's maybe one track I skipped, but the rest is very very nice. Worth a listen if you can find it. My is used ,but ""I Don't Give A Damm""Peace"
1,Obsolete Information,"This book contains old and soon to be obsolete information. Another reviewer says in his review ""Its my understanding that an update is in the works and it can only get better"". He is right. According to BICSI, they have written and will soon be selling a new version of this book. But this is the old book! I purchased this book now I find out that a new version is about to be released. I can't believe they are selling old book and passing them off as new material."
5,"So good, yet so short.","As like all the books, I loved this one. My only problem is that it wraps up too quickly. I can understand why though. It bothers me to see that it takes so long to write so little. But, I can understand that also. Anyway, I love the story, the series, and most importantly - Obi-Wan! Keep up the good work Watson!"
3,Beginning to repeat itself...,"Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon go to a planet where war is about to break out. There, they meet a pigheaded monarch and a troubled adolescent. Which Jedi Apprentice book have I just described? If you said #10, you're right. If you said #4, you're also right. I can think of at least two others that *almost* meet that profile. Don'ta getta me wrongo, Jude Watson's a good author, but imho, she's starting to burn out from writing one of these every two months; this would be a good story if it hadn't already been used. Also, the ""Star Wars feel"" of this one is lacking; it seens that the author visualized the alien characters as human, and with 10 books it's starting to be noticeable that the only planet and species seen in this series that are found anywhere else in SW are Coruscant and humans."
3,A Shattered Piece,"I thought that this book moved slower than the others, but I still enjoyed the story. Book 9 was so great, I was hoping for something more, but I still got a great Jedi Tale from reading this book. I am going to continue with the rest of these books and on into the rest of the Star Wars world after a short break into something else.But this series is a GREAT start to the Star Wars novels. I recommend them to people of ALL ages."
3,Shattered Expectations,"The Shattered Peace is a dip in the road that is the Jedi Apprentice series. It is hardly as good as most of its predecessors, suffering from a mostly predictable story, and, in fact, a story that feels like one we've read a dozen (or at least nine) times before. And what there is of a plot is seriously flawed. Rutan and Senali have been exchanging crown princes for generations, we're told, yet the reigning rulers behave as if each has never left his planet! Perhaps a ten year old will not be troubled by this giant oversight, but this thirty three year old couldn't get past it.It would be impossible to reach a constant level of excellence over ten books, so the relative mediocrity of The Shattered Peace should not dissuade one from continuing on with the series."
4,A shattered Pace,"I liked this book fairly well, but it sort of broke a good stride that Jude Watson had. Defenders of the Dead left you wondering of Obi-Wan's future, Uncertain Path left you wondering about Yoda's life! Captive Temple left you panicing about Xanatoes's evil plans, Day of Reckoning left you wondering what would happen now? and Shattered Peace left you wondering what happened to adventure, and what on Senali had just happened peroid? I am afraid it wasn't exciding enough, and it was rather confusing. Also not enough of Obi-Wan/Qui-Gon relationship development, more ""Qui-Gon's Big Adventure"" and Obi-Wan watches completly confused from the sidelines! I do sugjest to read it, but be ready for it not to be as good."
3,"Not too good , but O.K","This book wasn't as good as the others, but it just goes to show what different writers imaginations are like. I'm not going to tell you what happens in this book, but if your a jedi apprentice fan I guess your going to read it anyway and find out for yourself what happens.Anyway, if you are first readers of these series, I recommend that you start reading from book one."
3,I wish I was 12 years old.,"Unfortunately I am not, and I am getting really bored with the apprentice serie. I used to really enjoyed them despite being twice the limit age, but I lost the pleasure of these stories. Jude watson developped very well the personnages, but she does not seem to cope so well with the stories. Every story is similar to the preceeding one and it is really unexciting. But Again I am well above the limit age so.... To conclude I think it is a very good serie which suffers from weak stories, but which make us closer to the jedis."
2,Disappointing e-book,"Having been impressed with the print edition of this bible, I thought it would be a useful addition to my Kindle library (especially because it includes the KJV Apocrypha). But it is very difficult to navigate this e-book edition since the table of contents is impossibly long: it is just a list of every chapter of every book. The navigation is much better in, for instance, the Kindle edition of the Ignatius Bible (RSV 2CE).The text itself is marred by numerous scanning errors. The chapter headings, customarily printed at the top of the page, are omitted.We must hope that a sound digitally created edition of the KJV (complete with the Apocrypha and, like this edition, the important preface of the Translators) will eventually be ported to Kinde (this seems to have been created from a scan). The New Cambridge Paragraph Bible would be the ideal base text."
1,Sad Introduction,"I wanted to start reading the Bible and picked this version up. I was very surprised at the Intro which seems to treat this book like just another work of literature. Almost a fairy tale. Were these editors atheists? Don't know and don't care. I just know that I don't want their casual comments on the Holy Bible I choose to read. I will get another Bible. One that is treated with the respect it deserves. I question everything with boldness, don't need them to question it for me. If you can look past this, then you might like it since it's a paperback, it's light, the pages are not thin and print is not too small. It's about 2"" thick.I would have returned it had I picked up on this sooner."
3,Pluses & Minuses,"As best as I can determine, this is the only paperback edition of the King James Version with all 80 books included on the market. As such, as you're after one this will have to be it and I've bought more than one myself.Unfortunately, the notes in the back are not Christian (they contain a lot of so-called 'higher criticism') and perhaps this explains why the word 'Holy' is not included on the cover also. The type in the part before Genesis is a little small in parts but most people don't buy this kind of edition for the sake of those words anyway."
5,A Complete KJV at an inexpensive price,"This edition of the King James Bible is quite a value, both in price and in content. First, it is an inexpensive paperback, allowing those of limited means to enjoy the Bible in the classic language of the King James Version. Second, it includes the complete canon of the King James Bible as translated in 1611. Virtually all modern editions of the KJV fail to include the Apocrypha. This edition remedies that defect, rendering this edition suitable for use by Protestants, Anglicans, Roman Catholics, and eastern Orthodox Christians, as well as others who may want access to all the literature which Christians of various stripes consider to be scripture. This Bible also contains a brief appendix including helpful information on Bible history and on the various books which make up the Bible. A great Bible at a great price!"
3,Great Content ! - Poor Construction )-:,"I was glad to find a 1611 KJV with apocrypha. The text is easy to read and is same English used in he revised authorized KJV we currently have today. What else can I say about the content, other than it is - God's Holy Word!I have owned my copy for 4 years, and I use it regularly. The first problem I had was the size of the book. It is so thick, it is almost cube-like in appearance. The thickness makes the book cumbersome to handle. Second, the paperback binding is weak. The entire Gospel of Luke has liberated from the binding. I have glued it back several times. Each time a few more pages come loose."
4,A KJV With the Apocrypha,"Few people realize that when the Authorized Version (known today as the King James Bible) was printed in 1611 it included those books which Protestants refer to as the Apocrypha. A KJV with the Apocrypha is a rare find nowadays.That's what makes this paperback edition from Oxford University Press so neccessary. It not only includes the Apocrypha and the original translators' preface but it is also compact and quite affordable.The only drawback to this edition would be the absence of annotations and crossreferences. Otherwise, this is an informative and enjoyable edition of one of the greatest works of English literature, printed as it was originally intended to be read."
1,Christians avoid at all costs!!!,"No Christian should touch this edition with a ten-foot pole. While it does offer the beautiful KJ text with Apocrypha, plus the seldom-seem ""Epistle to the Reader,"" the editors are extremist Biblical minimalists, who regard most of the OT as fictional post-exilic propaganda. Among the many outrageous claims made in their notes: Abraham was an immoral monster; Isaiah and Jeremiah never existed; the Davidic dynasty never existed; St. Paul was a devious sophist who is responsible for centuries of anti-semitic violence; and on and on. The editors are almost gleeful in their corrosive scepticism. If Bertrand Russell had ever published an edition of the Bible, it could not have been more forthright in its atheism than this one is."
4,A Quieter Lentz,"Compared to ""On the Leopard Altar"", or ""The Crack in the Bell"", this is Lentz in a more subdued mood. There is lots of purposeful but restrained piano with soprano wordless vocals. The title of the album seems to be a joke. My french is poor, but it would seem to be ""Eight or Nine Pieces something something something"". In fact there are only eight, and the title given for the non-existant nineth suggests a desert of some kind."
1,A costly mistake,"Shaving with this is like shaving with a razor without a blade. As a result, my son uses the trimmer, which does cut, for shaving his entire beard. I purchased this for him based on the Amazon ratings, but it seems like other reviewers are using a totally different product."
3,Braun Is OK With ME...,"I bought this razor to replace my old Braun #5415, which I purchased over 5 years ago. It needed to have the batteries replaced as well as the foil & cutter, so I decided to replace it with the 5416.For my style of shaving it's fast & effective (I touch up with a ""Good News"" razor after mowing with the electric).According to the Braun Web Page, the main difference between the 5416 and 5414 is that the 5416 first discharges the battery before recharging it. The 5410 uses standard AA batteries.The main difference between the 5000 series and the 6000 series is that the 5000 is good for 35 minutes and the 6000 for 60-65 minutes of shaving time.You decide whether the extra time is worth the money, as they all seem to be pretty much the same and use the same foil & cutter set.Also, Braun allows you a 30 day trial period. So if you don't like it, you can return it to them (in the USA) for a refund."
3,Shaves well but not as well as 6000 series,"This was my 3rd Braun shaver. It worked well for 2 1/2 year and then the rechargeable cell (accu) went bad. Now it only holds power for about 5 minutes of shaving (even after a complete discharge/charge cycle).Otherwise, this model shaved very well (not Braun's best yet) with the and Flex integral head.I replaced this model with a 6520. The 6520 has the same head/foils but is larger, with a 6W rating (compared to the 5416's 5W). The result is a faster oscillation rate on the 6520 and less propensity to bogging down on 2 day stubble (i have a hard beard). The 6520 is a bit bulkier in the hand but it works noticeably better and faster (i shaved 40% of my shaving time).While the 5416 has been a good unit (although shorter lived than what i got accustomed to with Braun shavers in the last 20 years), the 6520 outperforms it hands down.If you can find the 6520 still, it is worth the additional expense for better perfomance you will appreciate every day"
1,They Don't Make'em Like They Used to!,"If you want to spend 15-20 minutes shaving each morning, then this razor is for you. Especially if you're not looking for a nice, smooth shave. The two-bladed design just does't move with the contours the way the bigger single blade does. This new razor was given to me for Christmas -- a replacement for my damaged Braun #5567, a cordless that I've used since 1995. My old razor, a single-bladed braun, cut much closer and smoother. And it took less time. Well, Ive taken out my old, taped-together Braun and will use it until Braun starts ""making'em like they used to!"""
5,Sinatra,"Well, thanks to my Philosophy class from 1998, I'm now a big fan of Frank Sinatra. I really lied this CD, especially the fact that it has the staple song from Guys and Dolls on it ""Luck Be A Lady"". Mr. Sinatra was Nathan Detroit in the movie, so he didn't sing it (Marlen Brando was Sky Masterson, so he sang it). It's a great CD and you should all hear it soon."
5,Great pick for the money,"Solid pick for the money, fits very well. Feels like you're playing with the extended edge of your thumb which is what should define a good thumb pick. I've paid more for picks not as nice. Note: I'm a fairly big guy, 6 foot plus, 200 plus, and the large fits very well."
3,Smooth reading but simplistic,"The language is easy to read and the style contributes to fast and smooth reading. The book can also be read very fast because there is not enough new facts in the book to slow you down.The book mainly explains the obvious (although too often ignored) practices that helps your development project: stay focused, avoid distractions, avoid interruptions, avoid wasting time, avoid unnecessary meetings (meetings are interruptions and far too often a waste of time), fix bugs early. The book has some stories to explain the above practices. But, the book has no hard facts to help you fight for the above practices in case you have a ""pointy haired"" boss.In my opinion ""Rapid Development"" by Steve McConnel is a far better book. ""Rapid development"" has all the hard facts that ""Debugging the development process"" lacks. ""Rapid development"" also describes more practices and has a broader view of the development project that ""Debugging the development process""."
3,"Good Book, Lacks New Ideas","Overall this is a good book that is an easy quick read. All of the ideas presented though are common sense. That being said, I have worked for enough organizations where the common sense presented in this book has been ignored. For those of you with a manager who does not believe in writing bug free quality code, buy him this book! It's even possible that he or she might understand what you are talking about when you say you hate status meetings."
4,Professional Project Management,"Although the focus is specific to software development, this book is a good primer for Project Leaders, Team Members and Managers on overall results oriented performance. Key points covered:Focus on project goals and priorities Simple process changes yield big results Attack the right problem Features must be strategic for the product Look ahead, don't let foreseeable problems surprise you Effective meetings end with decisions and minimize disruptions to work Post-mortems are effective if they answer how to fix problems Schedules are best if milestone driven, giving the team a sense of ""wins"" Grow your people, focus on immediate opportunities for feedback, avoid end of season coaching The product is everything that's in the box Leverage ProductivityI liked the real-world examples, and the varied experiences cited from within the walls of a respected development organization."
4,An excellent guide for development managers seeking guidance,"I recommend this book to anyone managing (or thinking of managing) a development team. It contains practical advice, good examples, and a real world feel for how developers work (and can improve their work) and how managers can ""stay out of their way"" so that they can get their work done. This is one of the only Microsoft Press books that I read from cover to cover. Highly recommended!"
5,"A find for a ""coder"" placed in the yoke of project managemnt","I loved this book and bought several copies for my senior management! It really helped this ""newbie"" supervisor to get started on the right foot! I'd recommend it to anyone who involved in software development. It's a book you'll want to keep within reach on your shelf at work."
5,Great for Software development team leads and Managers,"A co-worker recommended the book so I pick up a used copy from a 3rd party vendor here on the Amazon site. Been reading the book and it is absolutely as good as my co-worker suggested.Great ideas on how to lead software development teams. Lots of practical advice from someone who has been leading teams at Microsoft for years.I find the ideas useful, refreshing, and focused on making the best of your software developer resources. So much of what we end up doing in todays corporate world takes away valuable time and creates an less than idea environment for productive work.If you're buried in the development process at you're company this is a _must_ read to inspire you to take a look at you're teams, how to motivate them, and keep them focused on developing and improving the product."
4,Covers topics not found in most texts,"I am a software engineer with 20 years of experience and found this text to be informative and useful. Mr. Maguire's style is easily read and his observations are backed by numerous examples. The text is limited, however, by Mr. Maguires lack of experience in other types of software projects that don't have double digit headcounts. Overall I found the book to be a good addition to my library."
1,A long winded statement of the obvious,"This book contains some obvious advice which could easily have been condensed into under five pages. Obviously people don't pay money for five page books, so the author struggles to pad the meagre hard advice with patronising anecdotes. Life is too short to waste time reading books like this. Try the superiour ""The Mythical Man Month"" if you want to read software development anecdotes with some general advice. Unlike the latter, I doubt that ""Debugging the Development Process"" will be talked about and reprinted in 30 years time."
1,"This, is news??","I am glad I borrowed and read this book instead of buying it. (The loaner did not want it back, by the way.) A complete waste of money as everything contained in it has been said again and again by the same old worn out professorial ranks who live in ivory towers, adhere to 'publish or perish' in their efforts, and don't know the real world from the garbage they write about. An insult to any intelligent and educated person who truly knows the subject Don C. Locke purports to be an expert on. That said, it makes a good door stop."
2,Not as good as the RAXXESS screws here on Amazon,"I have ordered both these and the RAXXESS screws - and have to say that the RAXXESS screws are better quality by far. These screws have a tendency to strip out faster and are less resilient. The RAXXESS just seem to be made stronger and can take a bit of cross threading. I used these on a new and used rack, and like any used rack there is a tendency to have some messed up threads. The RAXXESS screws in the past have ""drilled"" through the worn threads whereas the Middle Atlantic screws have a tendency to strip much easier and quickly. Next time I will be purchasing the RAXXESS screws."
5,A must for the first time Craps player or the veteran Player,I have been a craps player for 47 years and this book acknowledge the fact that i knew there must be a way to consistely win at craps. It is an intense and demanding procedure to follow if you want to make money at craps. If not just go and have fun and give them your money.
5,The Cream de la Creme.,"This is the book that Frank Scoblete has hidden away up to now.Having read 1 other prior work by Frank, this book will confirm everything that his previous works did not disclose openly.If you had any doubts about dice control but are still interested in pursuing the facts, then this book is for you."
3,an interesting read...,"I blazed through this book in a day. It's a solid read, but definitely a little longer than it needs to be, as a lot of stuff becomes redundant as you move along. I also thought the learning sections could've been organized a little better, but admittedly, I may just be splitting hairs with that one (I think my conclusion is I would've enjoyed the DVD more - except it's really expensive.Anyone who is reading this book with hopes of becoming an instant craps whiz better look elsewhere. This book preaches hard work, focus, meditation, among many other things. If you truly believe that this works (I'm a bit skeptical myself, but hey, that's why Frank would call me a ""Random Shooter!""), then this will give you all the tools you need to go forth. But if you're sincerely interested in ""breaking Vegas"" via craps, then this book will show you how to get started."
5,My Winner's Bible,"I have been working on my dice control by using this book step by step as my bible of dice throwing. I have underlined and studied this great work by the world's two greatest dice controllers. It is hard work but I have now noticed that I am not a random shooter anymore.Thank you Frank Scoblete and Dominator, you have written a great book that craps players will find instructive and enjoyable to read as well."
3,Control Shooter,"While the substance and advice is excellent, there is an investment required in reading time, to be spent digging out working proceedures.A good portion of this book is spent glorifing other shooters, as well as the author."
1,Vegas Would Be A Ghost Town!,"After reading this book as I did, you may have a great feeling of confidence and a new interest in the game of craps. Don't get carried away though. There are studies that refute any influencing of the dice by dice setters. The only studies mentioned are by those who are selling dice setter information. The methods in the book are certainly worth experimenting with, but not with your hard earned money. If you have been to Vegas recently its apparent that many people have read this book and are trying out the theory of dice setting. Does anyone think if dice setting took even a tiny part of the casinos profit that it would be allowed to continue? I think casinos love people who have read this book and try to beat the game."
2,Good entertainment... Does not work,"This book is a good read and very entertaining if you are planning to go out to Las Vegas and play craps. However, the system and dice control does not work. Do not buy this book and think you are going to break the bank by ""setting"" dice. It even mentions in the book once the dice leave your hand randomness comes into play so you cannot influence the dice."
5,This Book Shows You How to Do It,"This is a book that shows you have to develop a controlled throw at the casino game of craps. It is written by Frank Scoblete and Dominator and has ninety four pictures showing everything you need to see to get a good idea of where to stand, how to grip the dice and how to throw.The book is loaded with proper betting information and it is a lively reading experience with many great insights and true stories. Throughout the book the authors allow many of the Golden Touch Craps dice control instructors to discuss all aspects of shooting with control over the game.I recommend this book highly."
2,A Boxman's point of view.,"I was a craps dealer and Boxman in Las Vegas for nearly twenty years. Every now and then a player would come along and try and set the dice and when that happened he would hear this:""Sir, please don't set the dice.""He would ignore me and set them again.""Sir, don't set the dice. When the stickman puts them in front of you, just pick them up and throw.Again he would ignore me, at which point I would look at the stickman and say, ""Dump the bowl, new shooter.""I can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that when you pick up the dice you are being watched by the stickman, the dealer on your end, the Boxman, the Floorman and the eye in the sky. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING MORE THAN A COUPLE OF ROLLS. Period.Please, please don't believe this, you can make millions by setting the dice nonsense. If you want to try it because that's your idea of fun, go ahead. Management will be polite, but they just won't let you shoot the dice anymore."
4,"Use as a compliment to a ""Brick Book""","Ms. Frisch's perspective obviously comes from a Unix environment. Her advice and writing reflects this.Partly because of its relative brevity, I cannot recommend this book by itself. It IS a requirement on any NT admin's bookshelf because it covers material completely ignored by the myriad ""Brick Books"" published by SAMs, QUE, Sybex and the lot, which are really just regurgiated material from the MS Resource Kit documentation."
5,Very useful and practical,"This is a great book, even for experienced NT administrators. The organization and clear writing make it easy to find and understand the most important aspects of NT administration. The comparisons to Unix were great."
5,comfortably clean pearly whites,"This Braun toothbrush may seem a little expensive at first, but it makes your teeth incredibly clean, like you've just stepped out of the dentist's chair! I've had this toothbrush for about one year and highly recommend it. I especially like the compartment on the back that holds two brush heads with different colored bands--family members can switch the heads without confusion. The brush pulses after two minutes, which is important and helpful for children, who tend to overbrush. Although the brush is very comfortable, my gums become tender if I use this toothbrush too often. I recommend alternating between your regular toothbrush and this one. Replacement brushes are available on Amazon.com."
4,Comprehensive and Well-written Resource,"This book is great! It has several practice passages, and the questions are really good. They adhere to the SAT format, and the answer choices are challenging, yet fair. The additional sentence completion exercises and prefix and root sections are really useful in SAT preparation. The only drawback to this book is that it uses many of the same sentence completion questions that you will see in their other test books, namely the Verbal Workbook for the SAT and the GRE test prep book. Other than that, the book is excellent."
2,"Sentence completion is OK, but reading is absolutely disastrous","Barron's has been accurate and helpful for brother, so it was only natural for him to buy this book for the SAT. This book divided sentence completion and reading comprehension into various groups for its difficulty. I found that the sentence completion questions are decent (not perfect, for no prep book can be exactly like the actual test). It was rather disappointing to see some questions were vague. For instance, it tested idioms which is not commonly seen in the actual test (in fact, I dont think it's seen at all). But the real disaster was the reading comprehension questions. The questions are not like the actual questions at all, and they are very subjective and ambiguous. If you get a few questions wrong using this book, dont worry. My brother got 3-4 questions wrong per passage in this book but got a 780 on the actual CR."
1,Disastrous Reading Comprehension Section!,"Do not waste time and money on this book! As covered by other reviews, the Reading Comprehension section of this book is terrible. The questions and answers are so vague and convoluted that you have very little chance of guessing correctly. Guessing is sometimes your only option as some of the questions do not have a reasonable answer listed. The explanations given for the ""correct"" answers make very little if any sense. This book is very discouraging to students and made me very anxious and scared about taking the SAT. I felt that there was no way to get these ridiculous questions correct no matter how much I studied. I have used other workbooks since that make much more sense and match what you will actually find on the SAT."
5,By Spideresswoman aka Spidygyrl,"To the point, this is a must have in your gothic music collection. I dont compare bands with other bands especially not in this case. Wired Remorse deserves a lot more credit than being compared. This release is unique, dark and dreamy. Nothing fancy, fake or over produced. Just straight out rockin goth with an edge."
4,Excellent album/band with few exceptions,"Although fans of recent phenoms like Interpol, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand will undoubtedly race out to get this. To me, this album has a more darker feel. I would compare it more to early Siouxsie and Joy Division, though not quite as good. Nevertheless, not a bad effort either."
4,are u crazy,I USED TO HAVE THIS CD AND IT IS PRETTY GOOD BUT WHO EVER SAID THAT IT IS WORTH OVER 100 DOLLARS IS A CRACKHEAD
1,Compost Compilation,"This is the most disappointing purchase I have ever made. Seriously, this poor attempt of a ""cover"" album is not even worthy of having any reference to Tori on it. It is a complete disgrace and I think even the record company should be ashamed. Not a single so-called ""artist"" on this CD does Tori any justice whatsoever. They even have the audacity quote her saying that doing a cover has to be a challenge. Well, kiddos, this is a challenge way beyond their league. I give it one star though I don't feel it's even worth that. Don't waste you time or your money."
3,Only one worthwhile cover,"Others are welcome to disagree, but I felt the only cover that was enjoyable as well as original (rather than crappily experimental in an attempt to do something different or basically the same song done below the established standard) was Tapping The Vein's ""Cornflake Girl."" Which I just found really... fulfilling. What a wonderful transposition from piano to guitar. What a refreshing scream with that generally male heavy metal vibrato. Damn.Judge me if you like, but that's my take on this CD."
3,Meegs and Jessicka Rock!!,"I find it funny that everyone who reviewed this album gave most of the artists bad reviews for not making the music their own...how much more of thier own could Meegs and Jessicka have made it...They completely changed the song into a different song. I am a hardcore Tori fan, and like some of the others i felt that the Glampire and Voltaire covers were by far the best, but Meegs and Jessicka are right up there. Has any of these reviewers even heard Jack Off Jill...Unlike most of the other girls on this cd who drone through trying to imitate Tori's voice, Jessicka keeps it real!Worthless tracks-Leather, Winter, Cornflake Girl, Sugar, Crucify, GodAt least the rest made an attempt to change the style up..."
1,very disappointing,"true, it must be very hard to cover any of the songs that Tori Amos has done, but this hasn't done her any justice at all. Most of it sounded as if they hadn't taken much effort with it and didn't show any creativity at all. The real art in doing cover versions is adding that little message of your own, as Tori Amos usually does. I'd rather listen to the real thing."
3,Passable Tribute to Tori Amos,"Cleopatra put together a fairly good tribute to Tori. Cleopatra's tribute albums are specifically geared to highlighting artists in their stable who would otherwise not get much media attention. This has resulted in an uneven album with some shining moments, and yet others which if not for Tori's talented writing skills, would be completely useless. Highlights for me included Beauty Queen (in Latin) by Unto Ashes and Caught a Lite Sneeze by Voltair (electronic, male). I particularly did not care for Dragon Style's cover of SpaceDog, or Amber Asylum's mimicking of Leather. Take a try if you are a consummate Tori fan with an open mind, but don't expect an album you will love 100%."
5,Great product! Get this if you want nice polishing cloths!!!,"If you're picking between this one and another 'diaper soft polishing cloth' - DO not pick any other one, I've purchased them all on amazon and this one is by far the best! very nice and smooth and really really soft. I polish very very fragile and easily scratchable ""laquered"" surfaces and I have tried over 50 different products out there. Definitely not the best one - but I'd say this is in the top 10, maybe 6-7.Have fun polishing. Don't polish through the clear though :)"
3,Another average one...,"As with one of the other Vintage Worship compilations ""Ancient of Days"", this compilation contains tracks easily found elsewhere. ""Give Thanks"", ""I Exalt Thee"", ""Mourning Into Dancing"", ""Blessed Be the Name of the Lord"", ""God Will Make A Way"", and ""I Worship You Almighty God"" are seen in plenty of other recordings that are still available. There are many, many more hidden gems in those early days of Hosanna Music from 1986-1992, that could have easily been put on this compilation. Would have liked to see some of the older tracks by worship leaders such as Randy Rothwell, Martin Nystrom, Kent Henry, Joseph Garlington, and Eugene Greco on here. Instead, we get the abundance of Don Moen and Ron Kenoly on these Vintage Worship releases whose music we can easily find."
5,My new favorite reel...even better than my Stradics,"I absolutely love this reel. I think that it is made better and feels more solid than the Shimano Stradics. I have a Stradic FI 3000 and 5000. The drag is smooth and reeling is smoother. Note that there is a huge weight difference going from the 40 to the 50...about 10 oz. I've got my sights set on a Cabo 30 or 40 next (14 oz) for speckle trout fishing. I've got the Cabo 50 matched up to a 8' St. Croix for surf fishing. When in the boat, I match it with a 7' Heavy Shimano Sagauro.I fish exclusively saltwater."
3,Good but not the best....,"Since I'm not a huge fan of remixes, I wasn't keen on the idea, but it's SbS, so I had to. So I would have to say that out of their albums that I do have, this is probably my least favorite, but it's still good."
4,Remix album gone berzerk!,"In general I have a problem with remix albums, and I'm certainly not a huge fan of Switchblade Symphony. However, after giving this album a listen...all I can say is that the remix mterial is much better than SS originals. This has to be one of the better remix albums sold on Amazon...it's not perfect, but it is good."
2,A Miserable Failure With Few Sucsesses,"I'd like to see them get away with this. As I am writing this I am listening to the Sweet remix, and personally it sounds more like hip hop than goth, and it's the same story with dollhouse. Athough Sweet does cause me to headbang rather violently, in terms of being named under a gothic band and having the unrelated name of 'Sinister Nostalgia' (as nothing is sinister about this album), this album is a miserable failure. The only real success (I didn't listen to the whole album for the saftey of my gothic air) is Clown, mother's mix. But in truth it is really just Mother (drool) and Clown combined, with Clown the prelimanary song.... This album has failed my expectations and has sorely dissapointed me. I would reccomend simply downloading the songs off of KaZaA or something rather than wasting your money, unless you like a strange mix of hip hop with a tinge of goth."
2,Episodes dissapear,"The episodes to this season keep disappearing . . . there are I believe 7 episodes so far and they keep disappearing from Amazon, even after you buy them. Not sure what the problem is, but so far it's just season 10."
3,It's the Duggars,"Not as fun as when they were poorer...but still enjoyable. I like watching the ""middle"" boys, they're always doing cool stuff."
2,costume,"The costume was made okay but it would never fit someone that needed a size it is supposed to go up to. I am 5'9"" and I had to cut it in half and make just a top out of it because it was too short waisted."
2,Not as good as the older one,I was disappointed. The new version just aren't as deep as the older ones. Very limited on the amount of goodies you can add!
2,Makes sandwiches and little mess - Did break after minimal use,"So far so good. I have used this machine three times and it is working just fine. Makes my grilled cheese-like sandwiches fast. Now I need to experiment with different breads and cheeses.Updated 2/5/13 - Well, it broke. The locking section broke off in my hands. It couldn't handle the two slices of normal bread and one square of American cheese. I could feel that it was heading that direction and even joked about it right before SNAP! in my hands. I guess i could still use it if I want to hold it shut the whole time. I think I'll just look for a better made one."
4,mmmm,Makes delicious grilled cheeses as advertised. Only criticism would be that it smells like plastic the first few times you use it. A few uses and scrubs and you're good to go.
2,Do not waste your money,Probably your sandwich maker won't close. It might come with damages from the factory. The plastic is done so cheaply that you could even cut yourself on the sharp edges. If it starts heating up it will smell like burnt plastic for days.On the good side - it will probably heat up.Good luck!I returned mine!
1,poor overall quality,We had it for four months. Used about once a week at most.It is very hard to close and overall feels like a low quality product.Today it stopped working altogether
2,DISAPPOINTED!!!,"I wanted a sandwich maker that would be quick, easy to use and that would produce a sandwich that would be crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. Well the first one I received didn't work at all. It would not heat up... so that was returned. The second one that I received still had issues with heating up. When you plug it in the green light is supposed to light up and when the it gets to the right temp. the red light is supposed to light up. Well that didn't happen. The red light stayed on the entire time...Ok I put the sandwich in anywayThe sandwich is supposed to be done in 2 to 3 or so minutes. After 10 minutes it still wasn't done. After 15 minutes I finally took the sandwich out (my daughter was hungry) it came out slightly brown. So that one has been shipped back as well. Needless to say I will not be requesting a third shipment of this product."
3,sandwich maker,"arrived on time and was in good condition. it works well, it just wasn't what i thought it would be. it crushes your sandwichs when it is preparing them. they look like a flapjack. not a sandwich"
1,Horrible unless you like your face irritated and not shaved,"Let's see... It does not give a close shave, so you press harder, at which point it irritates your face and leaves the beard behind. I returned it. I would give it 0 stars if I could."
4,Pretty decent shaver,"Lot of mixed reviews here... but they generally paint an accurate picture. I've owned a lot of braun shavers over the years-- dual heads, single heads, pivioting, etc. As others have noted, this is not the best, but pretty decent/good for the $s.Pros:Single foil head-- better than dualNice solid constructionGood power/ chargeClean close shaveCons:Long hair trimmer does not project far enough past main head-- bad for precision trimming.Bonus tip: one of braun's best shavers is the AA-battery powered 375 travel shaver. Get one of these and you may just ditch the conventional ""home"" setup completely!"
2,Bad trimmer design,"The previous review is right. I just bought this 3612 and immidately found that the trimmer is too short, thus very inconvenient. I am going to return it tomorrow and get either a Braun 5610 or a Panasonic."
2,Better to buy a better one,"Not a very good one if you have sensitive skin, but it is fairly good for the price."
2,Worst Shaver I've Ever Owned,"Single screen is just not enough -- takes a long time for a close shave, even on a light beard. Must shave everyday with this model or plan to spend 10 minutes going over and over your face. Trimmer cuts TOO close -- one slip and you'll lose an entire sideburn. Trimmer ejects at an awkward angle, making trimming difficult. Cord/cordless option is nice, though."
4,Finally Something that will cut my neck hair,"For the price this is a great shaver. I love that you can use it corded or cordless. I've used foil shavers for about 10 years now but have never been impressed with the way they can't cut my neck hair. I tried one of those ""lift and cut"" shavers and it was extreamly painful and didn't even cut. So I took the ""lift and cut"" back and bought this one. And in so doing I finally found one that I can cut my neck hair without popping out the trimmer.No complaints here."
5,Braun 3612 InterFace Rechargeable Shaver,I think Braun is the best shaver on the market. I've had two Braun shavers in my life and I'm 60 years old. My first was when I was 23 and it lasted me for years. I don't have a real heavy beard so an electric razor is great. No cuts or scrapes to worry about and I shave in about 3 minutes. Good service and fast delivery: Oh and I like being able to just stick it under the faucet and clean it off.
2,Cheap But a Waste of Money,"As a long-time Braun fan, I was appalled by the quality of this shaver. I don't have any kind of problem skin but the shaver painfully tugs at my beard stubble, leading to a lot of ""ouch!""s. The shaver irritates my skin and my skin develops red blotches. After about 50 shaves, the foil developed a large hole. The usefulness of the long-hair trimmer is very limited because when deployed it extends only about half an inch from the shaver at a 90 degree angle, which means you have to hold the shaver so close to the face that you can barely see what you are shaving. The only positive quality of this shaver is its light weight."
4,oldstuff,Purchased a new one as it was about the same amount as buying a new head. It works better than the old one and gives the shave that I expected. It arrived 4 days after purchase.
3,Review of Braun Electric Shaver - Model # 3612,"I ordered this shaver before departing for a six week vacation in England. It was promptly delivered in time to be fully charged and tried out before departure.This is a neat razor - well packaged, compact and suitable for travel. I had no difficulty recharging with the UK voltage - I had a plug-adapter and did not require a converter. A charge lasts about a week, shaving twice a day.However, this razor does not deliver a close shave. I have a light beard and could never obtain as close a shave as my old Norelco travel shaver provides. Of course, it is nowhere near the closeness of a blade shaver. I would not recommend this razor for an extended journey. It might be just OK for a week-end trip."
3,Can't finish the job,I've used Braun and Remington shavers for more than 20 years. My 2-day stubble is a good challenge for any electric shaver. This shaver gives me a close shave. I like the combi shave feature. The trimmer is useless. It reminds me of my dog's dew claws (I had those removed). I'm disappointed that Braun didn't pay attention to the trimmer. It means I have to have another tool to finish the job. They should improve the trimmer and offer a free replacement or coupon to owners of the 3612.
2,This is a poorly designed razor!,"Ever since Gillete bought out Braun, their razors have gone downhill. The trim edge tends to dig into your face. And to add insult to injury, the replacement blades cost half the price of a new razor. I suggest spending a few extra dollars and getting the better 3 head Braun model."
2,Travel shaver only,"Pros:CheapVery durableRecharges quicklyCons:Takes twice as long for a good shaveBeard trimmer is awkward/difficult to useBattery loses power quickly after long-term useI got sucked into the good price, but honestly, you get what you pay for. Have had it for about a year, and now that the foil broke, I think it's time to try a different model. As said in other reviews, I like the fact that it doesn't irritate like a rotary shaver, but you have to go over each spot several times (quadruple that for under the chin) to get a patch-free shave. After 1/2 year I've had to shave with it plugged in since the battery loses power very quickly, and consequently, loses shaving effectiveness (which was bad enough already). The beard trimmer is wickedly sharp but awkward to use - I've seen better setups for this feature on many other models.Bottom line - it does the job, but if I didn't have to use it everyday I would reconsider replacing it."
4,"Handy, Economical Shaver for Travel","This is my second purchase of this shaver, which I use exclusively for travel. It is lightweight, compact, works with or without a cord, and adapts automatically to international power standards. It does a decent job of shaving, although not as good as more expensive (and heavier) shavers, and the trimmer is easy to use. Charges quickly and holds enough charge for about week. All in all, a great value in a shaver for occasional use. My only complaint is that a replacement screen and cutter cost almost as much as new shaver, which is why I bought a new one when the screen on my previous one was damaged. I rate this 5 stars for value and 4 stars for shaving ability."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Unless you are a teenager trying to shave off a little peach fuzz, the 3612 won't do the job.The motor is so weak it almost stalls out on anything heavier than even a moderate overnight growth.The small foil will most likely wear quickly due to it's small surface area and is a joke compared to my old Braun 2000. Using the 3612 makes me long for my old 2000 back, too bad they don't make those anymore.Braun has discontinued the 3612 and I don't think I will shed any tears over that."
5,Saved from the dog,"I love camping with my dogs and they love camping, too. If I had not installed these in my camper, the dogs would have torn through the screen by now. If you camp with your pet, I highly recommend these."
1,Bent up and did not respond back to me.,I purchased one of these for my travel trailer. It came in a very large box. I opened the box and found the corner of the grille had been bent. I wrote twice and about this issue and have not heard back on either. I'm not at all happy about being ignored about this issue.
4,Good Screen Door Protector,"Screen Door Grille is of good quality. The adjustable door size mounts are pretty cheezy, luckly I was able to mount the grille without using them.The box that Amazon shipped it in was 100+ times bigger that necessary, what a waste of our natural resources and space taken up during shipping."
2,Materials are flimsy; much too expensive,"I carefully read the reviews posted before mine, then ordered the screen saver to protect our new camper door from our dog. When the product arrived I was not happy with the quality. The screening was dented, the supports around the outside were bent. My husband and I had to modify the whole thing to make it fit our ""standard"" camper door. Since Camco imports the screen savers from China, I will no longer order from Camco. It's obvious this company's quality control is lacking. It's the first product I've ordered through Amazon that was so poorly made with such a ridiculously high price."
2,Damaged,The box this screen was packaged in was to big and the screen was damaged.I was able to repair it and it fit fine. The finish and quality was fair. Wouldn't buy another one....
4,Screen door Protector,"We purchased this screen door protector so our ""Wonderful Pug"" would not destroy our door screen in our 5th wheel. It has worked great so far. Only thing I had to improve upon was the fact it was not wide enough so I added some aluminum 1.5 inch siding. It was also an easy install. Definitely a yes on this screen door protector grill."
5,Great screen door saver,"Had a hard time finding a screen guard for the screen door on our RV - but this one fit the bill perfectly. Like lots of people, we travel with our dogs and they were quickly making mince meat of our screen door in the RV when they were left alone or when strangers would walk by - which is ALL the time at parks and while camping.With the screen guard, their claws no longer leave holes and gashes in our door. And, my husband says this was a snap to install. Great product!"
5,Excellent historic details without being boring,"Fascinating history of both the country and the diamond business. Fast paced, interesting, makes you look at diamonds in a whole new light."
1,false in advertising - no seismic problems,"There are 20 tests with 50 problems each, ALL SURVEY, NONE SEISMIC. I contacted the publisher by phone and email, no answer...What is going on, am I the only one not finding the seismic???Who wrote all the 5 starts reviews so far?? I'll post again if I hear back for the publisher, but looks like this is a disappointing return."
4,good study material,this practice test had real questions that help get a feel for how the lsit is going to be.
1,"No Seismic, Very Dissapointed","Just found out that this cd doesn't have the seismic part on the CD. Feel like an idiot because that was the major reason for buying it. Even with the seismic, the program was flawed, answering questions wrong. I would rate the survey half of this cd to be about 2.5 stars. Nothing like the 4-5 stars from some of the other reviews. Unless the seismc section they got was head and shoulders above this one, I don't see how they could rate it that high."
2,My theory as to author's identity,"I read the book cover to cover and came away wondering if ""Karl Herr"" was really Silver Ravenwolf. What do you think?"
4,Hex book,"I am PA Dutch and it is getting harder to find books about our culture and our history. Hex and spellwork is a great book that tells of some of our history. I am trying to buy these books so that one day my kids will know and understand our history, because there are not many of us carrying it on. A great addition to my collection"
3,There is a newer edition of this product available!,"This is NOT by Rand McNally.When buying maps, it's always important to purchase the most recent edition. JIMAPCO puts humans out into the field in cars to field check their products before publishing a new edition.The newest edition of this product is ISBN #: 978-1569140093"
5,excellent portrayal of horse racing,"I watched this video last night and was very impressed with the authenticity of the horse racing industry as was portrayed in this film. I have lived in Saratoga Springs, NY (where the oldest thoroughbred race course in the country is located) most of my adult life. I have been involved in thoroughbred horse racing for many years - I have owned horses, gone to race tracks across the country, and have visited many horse farms in Kentucky - and I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary."
3,Great Promise But No Punch,"This is a great work, but unlike Bach, Mozart or Brahms, it does not ""sing itself"". The musical forces here are ample, but there is no power in the performance. Perhaps it is lost in the acoustics. You want to love this DVD - visually it's wonderful! - but all the energy seems to have been absorbed into the architecture."
1,system failure,"First time I used it, I was in a rush because I wanted to restore my computer. I saved some important files onto the flash drive and opened it to check that it was actually saved. When I restored my computer and plugged in the flash drive, all the data was corrupted. I checked from other computers as well, devastated at having lost everything. Nope. The other flash drive that I saved information onto works perfectly fine, though, so I know it's not the fault of the computer."
3,Forgetting the Accessories,"While this book features some interesting facts and pictures, I was very disappointed to find that the author almost completely disregards Jackie's use of accessories. I had hoped to learn about the handbags Jackie used, but despite brief references to her clutches, the only time he talked about them was to wrongly call the Gucci 'Jackie' bag - named after the woman herself - a Hermes tote. He also craftily avoids the subject of her shoes. Disappointing."
2,A disappointment,"I was disappointed by this book. The photographs are not of very good quality and the photo captions are occaisonally silly (""isn't it nice to know that Jackie indulged in an ice-cream cone?"" and ""Can you imagine how incredibly seductive it must have been to have the glamourous Jacqueline Kennedy, exquisitely dressed, leaning into you and whispering in your ear, with that feathery voice, in perfect French?""). I enjoyed the section on Jackie's fashion faux-pas, but Oleg Cassini's A Thousand Days of Magic and the new Met Museum exhibition catalog of her White House clothes tread the same ground far better."
3,Ok book,"This book seems to make a few assumptions about relationships, but overall it has some good ideas. I think with any type of book like this, you need to be willing to accept the fact that you are as wrong as your spouse. It did help."
5,Based on research with over 3000 couples,"Many marraige manuals are a therapist or educators ideas from their expereince with on couples seeking therapy. This is based on research on all types of couples, studied from various perspectives to determine what works and what doesn't. Great questionnaires for your and your partner to complete and help identify challenges that you may need to overcome, and suggests ways to work it out. All couples are different, but the more different you are the more you each have to adapt to make the marriage work. This book helps with both, identifying what work needs to be done and helping to learn what to do to make repairs."
4,Repetitive but worthwhile,"This book is very applicable to anyone who is married or about to be, and it is based on scientific research. My main problem : since it is the first book the author wrote for the general public (rather than journals) he tends to treat the reader like a child and repeat every single point 4-5 times! This made the reading go a little slowly. But by skipping a few paragraphs at a time, I learned a great deal about different types of conflict-solving, and have already used my new knowledge in my relationship with my fiance!"
2,Very typical... Most of it is common knowledge,"Dr. Gottman's book didn't cover anything most people have already heard. It's not what you fight about but how you fight. Who hasn't heard this line? Some of the quizzes to assess your marriage were interesting (for example, I didn't think I would be comfortable in an avoidance style marriage, but a quiz proved me wrong), but for the most part this book didn't offer me any new insight. I don't feel like any information in this book will be able to applied to help my marriage last. My husband and I also have a very good marriage, so I felt like a lot of the points presented do not apply to me. Dr. Gottman seemd to present too many scenerios between other couples instead of presenting practical information that is useable. I was disppointed, because I usually like most self-help books and find them useful."
5,Great book for starting a new chapter in working on your marriage,"This is one of the better books on helping marriages in crisis. I enjoy the writing style and ""real world"" applications of theories. Compared to other marriage help authors, you can't go wrong with Gottman."
4,"The science is new, but not the conclusions","Gottman's research integrity is impeccable and his data and conclusions deserve attention. One thing that irks me however is his disdain for his predecessors. The fact that many in the marriage field reached the same exact conclusions intuitively that Gottman verified empirically tells me that the intuitive method is not so bad in this arena. More than he admits, he is standing on the shoulders of others. That said, his warmth and humor is evident, and impartiality to any type of agenda is evident. In our present cultural environment, he is bringing an apparatus of credibility to the marriage and family field"
5,Excellent advice!,"I thought that this book was excellent in outlining the types of patterns we fall into when we get married. It gave me a positive but realistic outlook on what is going on in my marriage and how I can work on making it better. The author's de-emphasis on deep meaningful communication left me a little unsatisfied. Although I know that letting go of the little things is important, I feel that opening up to your partner is very important in a loving relationship. I like another book that takes this one step further in developing a deep caring relationship. It is called ""The Ever-Transcending Spirit"" by Toru Sato and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to understand and improve his or her relationship."
2,Knowledgeable author - inappropriate book for newcomers.,"There is no doubt about the genius of the young author, but the book moves at the wrong pace for those fairly new to HTML, STYLE sheets and JavaScript. Also, the book does not have enough detail for the experienced page designer. I am disappointed with the book and would not recommend it to others."
1,I want my REFUND!!!,"1) Almost ALL example sites in the book are outdated! When u are asked to refer to a site, most likely it is GONE already! 2) The CD does not include all the files. Missing gif files, html files..... You can't run all the tutorial. Someone was in a hurry to make a buck and forgot to put all the files together. For a book that relies on sample sites and tutorial, this book fails to deliever fully. Shop around for a better book if u are serious."
3,Good resource for the JavaScript-challenged...,"Although this is the first JavaScript book I've looked at, I've found that it's a good resource.I just bought the book today, and already I've added two JavaScripts to my company's web site. The grammar is a bit poor, which can make you stumble through some sentences, but the book is still relatively easy to follow -- even for someone with no JavaScript experience. The examples are helpful, and the explanations make the concepts fairly clear."
1,"Poorly written, poor examples, just poor!","This book has an attractive front cover which makes the consumer believe he is purchasing a fun book that will show him all sorts of neat things to do with java script. This just isn't the case. Looking beyond the poor grammar, the examples were confusing and with the completion of the book I learned very little. The little that I did learn was very basic and didn't help me design an interesting page as the cover suggests."
2,Could have been good,"What can I say?...this book is written by a 17 yr old...and it SHOWS. In the past 1 1/2 weeks I've struggled thought the first 21 pages and I've already ran across MANY confusing examples. For example. They give you code in green boxes and most of the time its supposed to work. Well..when you try it 1/2 the times it doesn't because you needed to add all of this other code that they don't tell you about. They tend to say ""if you look at this simple code...its all you need"" and like I said more often than not it isn't.The ONLY people i would recommend this to are people who have a fare amount of JavaScripting behind them, because they will be able to recognize where they have presented the info in a confusing way, and hopefully they won't have to spend time browsing the CD for code examples."
4,"A good, brief overview. Not without problems.","I've read both books by O'Reilly & Assoc. dealing with JavaScript. Whereas ""The Definitive Guide"" is a dry, comprehensive reference of JavaScript's implementation in 3.0 browsers, ""Designing"" is an inviting overview of JavaScript through its implementation in 4.0 browsers. This approach is helpful if you wish to get a good grasp of the language's potential without dwelling on basic programming concepts---most of which are covered in ""The Definitive Guide"". However, this rushed approach has a negative side. In addition to various (forgivable) editorial oversights, the example code frequently suffers from (not so forgivable) inaccuracies. The example-based teaching approach of the book is a superior introduction to JavaScript, but unless the reader is experienced in detecting logic errors, it may be a frustrating introduction to the language."
2,"Fine for the time, but grossly outdated today","I bought this book nearly a decade ago, and thought I'd pull it out for a bit of a refresher. Not surprisingly, the code examples are woefully out of date (it predates XHTML/CSS), and generally don't work with modern browsers. Not to mention many of the examples given are now considered to be bad practice these days (pop-up windows, changing the status bar text, etc.)It was a good intro to JS back in the day, but time marches on."
3,A so - so guide that is not always cross-browser,"I am a fairly new practitioner in the world of designing with javascript and this book definitely gave me a nice primer on a lot of the things I will need. But to my disappointment, that's where it stopped. All in all I am only slightly more knowledgable and powerful in designing with javascript after reading this book. I am currently going to buy the ""Definitive guide books"" on javascript, css, and dhtml to broaden my horizons. CONCLUSION: If your a newbie in the world of javascript and design then this book is definitely a nice start but by no means should you expect to be well versed after this book."
2,Save money. Download JavaScripts from the web for free.,"There's not that much in the book which isn't available from websites. If you need scripts then you can either go to commercial sites or even university sites to get tutorials.Javascript is certainly worth getting to grips with but this potentially good book is hideous to read (probably nothing to do with the talented young author). There's so much choice available in titles now so take time over your purchase. However, this book may become better in future editions."
4,"Good book, but before it's time.","This was a great book for an introduction to programming with javascript. The book presents everything in easy to understand methods, and examples that are practical, and real world. The only draw back is that this book came out as soon as the 4.0 browsers did, and JavaScript has undergone quite a change since then. Great book though, I look forward to the updated book coming out in December."
3,Good Book for Beginner,"This admirable book tells beginners how to create dynamic web pages. It teaches you the basics about JavaScript. Also, it has a nice introduction about object-oriented JavaScript."
3,A bit out-of-date,"The book has potential, but it lacks some code that would prove useful for ambitious programmers."
4,"Good,but....",I have a problem in this book~~~ Wish Nick Heinle can answer me~~ the example :9_4.htm I can't see the rotate by IE 4.0 Please mail to me ~~~quick~~~
3,"Has Potential, But...","I would say this book is a good introduction to JavaScript, however the author seems to lack the ability to thoroughly explain all of the concepts. The content presented is incomplete and fails to give an overall picture of the power of the language. This book serves as a good 'plain english' companion to a more in-depth book."
2,"Good for specific scripts, but teaches little","This book is great for stealing script examples, but it doesn't teach you enough about the language for you to write good scripts by yourself. I found many typos in this book which leads me to beleive that it wasn't edited well. If you are looking for specific scripts like a date & time script, or something like that, this book is great; but if that's all your looking for, don't spend the money, get on a chat room. If you are an experienced JavaScripter, this book might be good to give you ideas."
4,Excellent for Beginners,"Great book if you have absolutely no real programming experience (outside of HTML). Easy to read, with a line by line breakdown of example scripts -- so within the first few chapters you'll be able to actually have a feel for what's going on in other people's scripts.The book doesn't attempt to be comprehensive, so it does look like you'll need to get another ""advanced"" book after finishing this one. Also, be forewarned that this book DOES have coding errors in it -- quite a few of them, in fact.All in all you can learn a great deal & have a lot of fun with this book -- kudos to the author for making something clear when so many others have made it completely obtuse (this is the 3rd JavaScript book I bought and the only one that has really taught me anything about it) --- although they should have hired a better proof reader on the code examples!"
2,"Good overview, lacks depth","This book compares to the millions of other computer related books that overview the many aspects of the Internet. I learned very little from this book and found it interesting but uninformative. The scripts were fun but very elemantary. In conclusion, the book does very little as far as developing an advanced JAVA oriented web site, it does however, help the beginner learn the basics."
2,Kinda Wide,"Really like the look of these sandals, but they're kinda heavy, and run wide, hence I feel like they're gonna fall off my feet.I think I'll buy my shoes in a ""real"" store where I can try them on inthe future. I think the internet's great for certain things, but not shoes or bras!"
2,Not what you would expect from Sketchers,"They do not feel soft on your feet. It feels like you are walking on solid wood, no cushin. The strap does not give when you walk, it constricts the foot. They are very cute, but uncomfortable."
1,Too wide.,I ended up returning these shoes. they are too wide and I felt like you could see more the sole than my foot.
2,"Cute, not too comfy","This is the first pair of Skechers sandals I've owned that will probably sit in the closet awhile before being donated to the Goodwill. They look nice, but aren't easy on the feet. It's not the fit, either. It's just how they ""slop"" on the foot. Probably the reason for the deep discount."
5,The California Raisins,The movie was in excellent condition and it was here three days sooner than I expected.
2,Not true Lavender- Smell like a man!,I've been on the hunt for a true lavender scent and this item is not it!! It's mixed w/ other base notes so the lavender gets muddled in the perfume. I also strongly agree with other reviewers that it smells very manly! It does smells like a man's aftershave- not womanly at all.
5,stencils,"If your making stencils this stuff is great. Very nice, perfect thickness. I thought it was a bit pricey, but when I checked it out at the local craft store, it wasnt."
3,BRAUN 7000FC Syncro 7000 Foil - Cutter Combination,"The foil on my old cutting block developed a hole, so I purchased this replacement part to extend the life of my shaver. This is more or less what I was able to do.After installing the new parts and shaving, I did notice a general improvement of the shave quality. But this only lasted for the first 10 or so shavings and pretty much degraded to what I had become accustomed to in the past with my old foil/cutter block. (I have a Braun auto-cleaning unit as well, so the equipment was being properly maintained). There isn't any reason to complain if you like the usual shave with your Braun shaver. Just keep in mind that this product won't radically change your shaving experience. To be honest, this part is only really needed if your current part is broken (as opposed to just dull)."
4,Make Your Razor Like New Again,Braun recommends replacing these items every 18 months. The original set that came with the razor only lasted about 11 months before a hole appeared in the foil that resulted in painful pinching and pulling of my skin. The replacement combo fixed it right up like new.
2,Not as advertised,Ordered this and received only the foil. I contacted the seller and they sent the cutter block. My order said foil and cutter block but when it arrived the packing slip for the order only said foil. As to quality I believe it is below par. Does not show it as a knock off but it is. The shave is not as good as the OEM. There is a lot more pull and it is not as close a shave.
2,Unreliable seller,"Product is fine, but I would not buy from this seller. They told me it would ship immediately and then gave me a ship date of a week later. Not terrible but not what I expect from Amazon."
1,Foil doesn't fit my razor!,"This is weird. The foil part didn't fit my 7505 Braun razor. The shape of the actual foil I got is slightly different not only from my old piece, but it is also different from the picture on this site and even from the picture on the package it was in!"
2,Great Shaver--Foils Stink,"I absolutely love my Syncro shaver--it's the first one that I've owned that doesn't rip up my face and still keeps everything close.However, these foils are junk. This is the third foil I've had to buy in the past six months. I use it only in my bathroom, so it's either shaving my face or sitting in the cleaning apparatus--it's not bouncing around in a glove compartment or anything like that. Nonetheless, it develops holes in the foil that allow the blades to make contact with my face, which feels GREAT. Bloody mess, anyone?..."
3,Cutter block doesn't fit,"Just got it few days ago. The blade can fit in my Braun 7526, but the cutter block won't fit. So, if you want to buy this to replace yours, maybe you are going to have another useless cutter block. It's not worth it."
5,smooth shave,"I didn't realize how dull my original blades were. I mostly bought this kit to replace the micro screen. My old one had a hole worn in it and the shaver was cutting me. Since it came with the new blade, I replaced both. What a difference! If anything, the shaver works better than new now."
2,Disappointing redesign of foil,"This should have been a very simple purchase of replacement parts. However, Braun has seen fit to redesign the screen pattern on the foil. This provided a noticeably less close shave in combination with the new cutter block as soon as I used it. I put the old foil back on (but kept the new cutter block), and the closeness of the shaver improved immediately.So, looks like I'm using the old foil until it gives up the ghost."
5,goodbye Wallyworld,This same item was $10 more at the local Walmart.Its pays to research.The product is great!
3,not as good as I hoped,"I bought this replacement based on other reviews. The blade fits my 'newer model' shaver, but doesn't cut near as close as the original. I still like the Braun over any other electric razor I have owned."
3,Blade is best Braun is a close second,Maybe it is my face. I have thick facial hair and it takes only 2 days to get real thick. The Braun Syncro blades do a good job of getting the hair close to the face. Unfortunately I still need to use a razor for that baby bottom feel. I don't mind using the electric and the razor together because I have less irritation using both. So all in all these blades do the job. They work perfectly for my dad who has finer facial hair than me. Thumbs up to Braun for they always make great products.
4,Blade or Electric,It's pretty darn close with the Braun Syncro. The cutter and foil are good quality the only downside is the price it could be a little cheaper but thats where they get ya. Other than that these replacement parts work great. They say a change is needed every 6 months. I think thats a general assessment it all depends on how much you use the shaver and how bad you growth is. For me I have to change the cutter and foil every 4 months and that beats buying blades every 3 weeks.
1,Wrong Part,"When I was looking for a replacement part for my 7000 series Braun electric razor, the part I ordered stated that it fit ALL 7000 series Braun electric razors as a replacement head and the picture looked the same as the head I needed to replace. The connectors on the head would not fit my razor and I had to return an opened package. Without opening the blister pack, there was no way of knowing whether or not it would fit. This of course affects the amount of refund available."
4,Like New,"4 of 5 because of price. Not amazon's fault but these things are stupid pricey. But, works great. Shave in half the time. Plus shipping was very quick."
3,Not exactly as I had hoped,"Replacement cutter seemed to be less sharp than the cutter it replaced. Both were Braun replacement products, but the closeness of the shave was noticeably different. Maybe it needs to be broken in for a few weeks, but right now, I'm disappointed in the closeness of my shave."
5,"Good product, fast delivery, fit my old razor 100%.",I needed a replacement the old screen and blade in my razor. This one fit perfectly and is working just as well as the old one did when it was new. Thanks.
3,Great as long as you are not deployed,This product was great once I could get it. Amazon wouldn't ship overseas so I had to have it sent to a stateside address and then have it shipped to me in Iraq. I will order it through someone else next time I need it.
1,doesn't work for Braun 7680,"Seeing someone else's review that this product isn't like the photo, I bought the *other* Braun 7000 shaver screen ($2 less). And I had the same problem--it has a yellow base (not black) to the cutter block and it doesn't quite fit my 7680.So if you've been discouraged from buying this one, I'm not sure the other one (""Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro/Syncro Replacement Combo"") is any better!"
3,"Product is fine, price too high, 2 weeks for delivery","This is the only replacement foil I found on the web, so had no choice but to buy it, since my cutter is fairly new and still works fine. But for a knock-off product the price is kind of steep, when $4.85 shipping fee was added. Also, the product didn't ship for nearly 10 days, and I finally received it about 15 days after I placed the order.The foil itself works fine, hopefully it will last a long time."
4,Amazing,Ijust received my new cutter head and it has renewed my razor back to its original state. highly recomend it!
5,Razor Foil and Blade Replacement,I love the Braun rechargable electric razor my dad gave me. I'm in the US Navy so it worked out well while on deployment. The new blades and foil kept it running like a brand new razor. It was highly rated here and I concur with that rating.
1,Not a good replacement,After a months use the close shave has deteriorated to a poor shave. My beard now feels like I have shaved 12 hours ago right after shaving ... not good for a new cutter and foil. The original lasted two years. Cheap Chinese junk!
3,Great service but next time its a new razor,"Product came quickly and as promised. I guess I was hoping the new blade and foil would make the razor better than it ever was. I have my old razor back, thanks to the new parts, but I think I'll upgrade to a new razor next time I need replacement parts."
3,Disappointed,"Purchased the kit for the long overdue replacement (according to the manufacturer)of the original blade and comb set, to find that the newrequired considerably more time and effort to shave as closely, as the old. Guess I should have ordered the parts specifically for my Model 7526instead of going for what appeared to be a newer (at least the comb portion) kit, which is probably for the newer models."
1,bait and switch,"I gave this item a bad ratings because it is NOT the claimed model listed as being sold! This is the newer (and by many opinions poorer) design with blades oriented horizontally under the foil. I cannot find the older vertical style block for my 8000-series anymore, and saw a review for that line stating the 7000-series fit, and that most of the 7000 series were the old style. Disappointed with Braun for changing the design without offering alternatives (an electric shaver is quite the investment), and the seller for not updating information- giving me false hope of getting the old style block/blades. I'll keep and use these, but would have enjoyed seeing if the old kind cut better/last longer."
5,A New Shaver Everytime the Head is Changed,"Changing the tires on the car certainly doesn't make a new car... but in the case of a new shaving head for this Braun shaver, it brings shaving back to the efficiency and speed that the shaver was when I first bought it 10 years ago."
2,replacement of Braun shaver foil and cutter,"The shaver I have is about 4 years old. It is the most expensive self clean available at the time. It is I thought the 7000 series but somehow the parts I ordered did not fit my Braun self clean system. I ruined my 200 dollar shaver when trying to fit the new items. I know and accept responsibility for this, but it was not easy to order the right parts the way Braun has the different shavers numbered! Since I opened the package and ruined my expensive shaver I must say my first experience with Amazon was an expensive situation. I now have a cheaper Remington, but the Braun was much better. Thank you. Sincerely, Ed Foster."
4,"best system, but change regularly","Never let it be said that electric shaving saves you money.But, as one that can't really be bothered wet shaving, plus when I do I cut myself to shreds, I have to say this is the best system I've owned and it's worth swapping the foil way more often than the 18 months mentioned in the manual; I tend to only go 3-6 months before swapping and I can really notice the difference.The other way I generally extend the life of these foils is, if like me you don't shave over the weekend, when Monday morning comes, use the clippers on the shaver to cut your growth down to a stubble and then shave; I find this gives a better cut and a cleaner shave after that.So - a good product but could be tougher (it should last longer than 6 months) and could be less expensive.Happy shoppingJB"
3,Close shave - doesn't last long,I had to replace mine after only 6 months of use (not 18 months like instructions say) - it had large holes in the screen. I called Braun (1-800-braun11) and they said the only way that happens is if you apply too much pressure when shaving (which I don't). They will send a free replacement if you call though.
2,"Product is described ""Foil and Cutterblock"" but does not include cutterblock.",Braun Syncro 7000 Foil And CutterblockThis product ships without the cutterblock so the product name should be changed to omit the word cutterblock.
4,Smooth n' quick,I don't like shaving in the morning as much as the next guy. Having a great rechargeable like this Braun makes it as painless as possible and gives me a great shave everytime! Best electric I have ever used with regularity.
1,factory error,Factory error for Braun 7000 series cutter and foil head replacement. The bubble pack that comes from the factory contains a 5000 series foil head that will not fit a 7000 series shaver. Amazon should send all the mismanufactured product back to the factory and list as out of stock until the situration is corrected.
5,Braun replacement,We have tried to find this replacement at Sears and other stores to no avail. Thanks to you we now have what we need for my husband's razor.Thanks so much!!!!
3,Wrong screen,Cutterblock was fine but the screen was the wrong size. I had the correct series shaver that was supposed to fit this item.
3,Braun Replacement Head,This replacement is not as good as the original head that came with the razor.
4,"Replacements work well, but are a little pricey now","These replacement blades/screens work just as advertised. I replace mine about once per year as they dull about that often if one shaves 6 days per week on average. I have noticed that the price on these replacements have slowly been rising over the last couple of years, unsure if that's standard inflation or because they want customers to upgrade the razor instead of buying replacement blades/screens. Overall though, it's a quality product and this is simply the cost of maintenance."
4,Braun 7000fc replacement combo review,"I had my old razor head for 2 years, and this was a much needed replacement. Shaving takes less time, with less razor burn."
1,WRONG PART,THE FOIL DOESN'T FIT MY SHAVER AS THE AD SAID IT WOULD. HAD TO BY A FOIL ELSE WHERE. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR THE BRUAN 7526
1,The screen does not fit 7680. Don't buy this until its fixed.,Like previous reports - The blades are OK but the screen has new design and will not fit the 7680 model I have. I've bought this same item in the past with no problems. Apparently Braun did a mistake or a careless redesign.
5,Don't forget to change the parts,"A lot of folks who use electric shavers tend to take them for granted. They seem to feel that the cutting parts will last forever with no maintenance whatsoever. Then, when the shaves aren't as close as they would like, they tend to blame the machine rather than their own inattention. Braun provides a little sticky label that you can put on your shaver to remind you to change the foil and cutter blocks, and to put the approximate date around which this should be done. It's recommended, and extremely easy to do, even for a manually-challenged lawyer such as myself! Everything is provided, all you have to do is a few short moments of labor, and your shaver is as good, and as close, as new. What more can anyone ask?"
1,Tin foils,"As with two other reviewers here, my foil developed large holes within 6-9 months of purchase. I can't imagine how Braun claims 12-18 month lifetimes for this part."
4,Best Shaver ever,"This shaver is the first one I bought and kept. Usually I find them, try them, take them back and back to the razor. This time I did keep this shavor. It cleans itself, its cordless, and its close. Im a bit overweight so it takes a few runs to get real close on parts of my face but I love it. Its well worth the price."
2,"Neat shaver, but foil and cutter don't last as advertised","I like the Braun Synchro shaver because it cleans itself and is cordless, etc. However, I am a bit disappointed with the cost of replacement cleaning fluid and replacement foil/cutter. I am now replacing the foil and cutter because the foil has developed large holes, even though I clean regularly as instructed per the manufacturer. Also, I do not get as close of a shave with the Braun Synchro as I do with a cheap, disposable razor and shaving cream.Update 6/19/2005:I switched over to a Norelco Specrta 8895XL one year ago. I am still using the original cutter heads, and it has been a breeze to periodically clean with just running water. Also, the battery lasts over a month between charges. I am quite happy to no longer be replacing the cutterhead (and cleaning solution) so often, as I needed to with the Braun."
5,Excellent replacement part,I ordered this for my 5-year-old razor that tore it's screen. The part arrived on schedule and in good shape. It installed easily and worked flawlessly.
4,Braun Syncro,The replacement product does not seem to work as well as the original. There are certain places that it misses that the original didn't. Other than that it works well.
4,Compatible with thinkPad x61s,"I bought this to use with a ThinkPad x61s. It works fine in Windows, however using it as a boot device is problematic. At times the laptop doesn't recognize that it is attached. A workaround is to try rebooting over again, entering the bios, exiting the bios, rebooting, and hitting F10. You may have to repeat this process, but eventually it will show up as a bootable device.Also, the AC adapter plug doesn't quite fit the AC jack, seems like it is the wrong length, but it does work."
3,Bizarre Book,"Color photo on the outside, only B&W on the inside. Also, each listing is nothing more than a single publicity photo with the show's sales blurb. Could have been a great book but the author did not put much effort into this one."
4,sizing,"I bought this product going by the reviews. The reviews said that the product ran small, so I bought a size up for my Yorkie. WAY TOO BIG! I am not even sure a small will fit even though that is his normal size.They have a sizing chart on their website might be helpful.very good price for the product and cute. Good and fast service."
1,Made in Taiwan,"Do I need to elaborate, I dont think so. Estwing gives you the impression their tools are quality US made items."
3,okay to good,"This book was easy to read, very light. But found for my part too light. I guess I found the characters lacking somewhat. Nothing wrong with the book but not emotionally satisfying."
4,Germany's poor management of industry lead to their defeat.,"This is an excellent book describing in detail Germany's misuse and abuse of their war supporting industries, referring particularly to aircraft production. How retooling the production lines after minor changes instead of keeping production going, changes in prioritizing, and the cannibalization of experienced instructors for duty on the front led to a constant and steady drain on the Luftwaffe. A student of industrial planning or strategy will find this a fascinating read. Has numerous tables and references."
5,Well worth the price.,"This is my second favorite compilation album (first would be The Black Bible also by Ceopatra Records). The stand out tracks are Voltaire, Glampire, The Awakening (Sexy male vocals), Virgin Black, and Messey. The Messey song is actually pure amazing...Messey is Jessika From Jack Off Jill, and David J from Bauhuas. Anyways, if you like goth music, this is a damm good CD to add to your collection."
1,"Give me ""Welcome Back, Kotter!""","As someone who is slightly familiar with public education, I found this book to be a source of nothing other than rural sap. I thought I was getting an insightful effort, but what I got was cliche and mindless nothings. The writer has a flair for the obvious. That's about all I can say about this book. I tried. Little engaged me and that's what I look for in a book. Sorry. Next time, I'll just buy one of the standards, like ""Up the Down Staircase,"" or ""Blackboard Jungle."" Spine is below that standard. By a country mile..."
3,very good book for preachers,"At times the writer went very slow in the story development, but once fully read we as readers need to understand that it truely is the Spirit of the living God that must move us. Any preacher that disagrees with the spirit of this text, is a preacher who doesn't preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. And we need the Spirit moving in our lives as well as in our churches."
4,Fun for young kids!,I waited a long time to purchase Tapping and Clapping and now I wish I had ordered it years ago. I love that these rhymes are passed down from another generation. My kids especially loved the page that had movements to do on their backs. Even my 4 1/2 year old loves it. I would definitely recommend this book to Moms who are looking for something a little different and a little nostalgic for their toddlers.
3,Needs more songs,"This book has lots of chants, but not enough songs. I think it could be really great if there were more songs notated."
4,Good deal,I have several of these (3612) razors. The only thing that wears out is the cutter.Low cost solution for years of shaving.
4,Needed a part,Arrived in a timely manner. Nicely packed and cheaper than from the outlet store from Braun
1,"Bad design, foil/cutter block continue to break","I bought this razor to replace a braun razor I had used for 20 years. The rechargeable battery in the old razor finally gave out and it was going to cost me more to replace it than I would pay for a new razor. So I figure why not get a new one. Well... I got the new razor, a model 3612, and after about 2 weeks, a part fell out of the cutter block while cleaning it. I figured I was too rough with cleaning, so I ordered a new one (almost as much as the razor) well.. it breaks the same way. I called Braun and all they would do would be to send me another foil/cutter block. I asked if they had no intention of standing behind their product and they said only to the extent of sending me another cutter block just like the 2 I had already been through. I would NOT buy any razor from this 3600 series again and I would NOT recommend anyone else buying one either.Willy Evans"
1,Replacement needed far too often,The blurb says replace the foil every 18 months but I've had to replace it twice in less than a year due to tearing of the foil. I have two extra cutting blocks now. They should at least sell each of these parts seperately.
2,Foiled again!,"The manufacturers of electric shavers appear to be taking pages out of the playbook used by makers of printers, which are often priced cheaper than the print cartridges themselves. Once they've got you as a customer, they figure the red ink will soon be the customer's, not theirs. Purchasing another screen (my 3rd or 4th in two years) for a shaver that cost me only 20% more than the flimsy foil itself strikes me as exhorbitant if not exploitive. (The least Braun could do is make the foil available as a separate item rather than bundling it with the cutter assembly.) I'd try a Norelco or Remington, but I think they're all manufactured in China for the same U.S. company (Gillette?). I may bloody my face for a few more days before throwing in the towel--or trying a Panasonic."
1,Too expensive!!!,"The razor is good by itself, but the replacement pack is way too expensive. You could find a new Braun 3000 series razor at $30. Why bother to get the replacement pack?"
3,Good footage but not what was expected,"This video shows a lot of original footage that I have never seen before but there is very little of the film that actually talks about tanks. Most of the DVD is made up of German training films which are good, but speak about tactics and not about the actual armor. There is nothing about the different types of tanks used or any specs, mostly just the two training films. The 1st shows a Panther but no real info on its design, development ect. and the 2nd film shows a few halftracks but again, no info on tanks. I still liked it because of all the rare footage but it really has little to do with Panzers."
3,Enough basic information for both PC & Mac users.,"Some of the information does not come with enough technical details but with lengthy comment E.g.: On page 49, the author spent a lot of time comparing the Eraser feature of Corel 7 to Corel 6!!! Who needs that? We are reading a book about Corel 8 not Corel 7 or 6.The book is more than 900 pages thick. Compared to other publications with the same subject, the fonts here are much bigger to artificially increase the thicknes of the book.If you need to use Corel 8 on both PC & Mac, this is the book to buy. Otherwise, ""Corel 8 secrets"" and ""Corel 8 bible"" contain more details."
4,Near Perfect coverage of a complex program,"Well, after working with every version of Corel for more than 9 years, I still find myself needing a good book to help me through the sections that I don't often use or are just plain hard.... This book is a great reference to a complex program. CorelDraw 8 is a near do everything program and it takes a ""Large"" book to cover it all... this one sure does that. Thanks for all the help. Well written and to the point."
2,Poor,"Simply put it - this book is about as poor and rigid as CorelDRAW 8 as a software. Too hard? Well, if compared with Painter 5 or Adobe Photoshop 5 then you know what I am talking about. One needs to spend hours to develop an image that take few mouse clicks with Painter. CorelDRAW has powerfull drawing program and integrates a lot of other things but none of them is equal to specialty software. The book shows that clearly - very technical and rigid introduction in subject with no imagination and rather poor graphics. If this is what experts can do in DRAW, what is to be expected from a beginner??? If I need an index, I would use program's index files anyway! However there is more than that - check Hunt's book. Don't waste money on this book unless you really need to. There are no too many good books about DRAW around, but this one is certainly not among them."
2,Pointless Book,"Do you have a time to study DRAW in so much details without beign able to study the rest of the suite? If you are professional and want to get a hand on every aspect of DRAW then using help index of the software is more sensible approach anyway than reading a book so short on excitement and creativity. And another thing - if a professional cannot come up with better illustrations than those in the book, is it worth to spend time studying that software at all???"
1,Let the Worshipers Arise,I was very disappointed when I received this CD as the case was broken and the first six songs skipped. The rest of the CD won't make a sound. I was not happy.
5,Awesome Praise Album!,"This is a great album. There isn't a bad song on the whole CD! It has become my favorite in my collection! If you love good praise and worship albums, this is a must have! P, C & D have done it again!"
5,One of our favorite cd's of all time!,My husband and I have always been a fan of this group. This cd is truly one of their best! We listen to it over and over and get blessed every time! Buy it and you won't be sorry.
2,Not What I was Expecting,"I was looking for more information. This is a basic overview of ""A Course in Miracles"". It did give the history of how the book came to be which was interesting."
4,Designed for us reluctant interviewers,"I never prided myself on my interviewing skills, and I was always amazed at how much better prepared the candidates were than I. But now I actually feel competent to conduct an effective interview. And I've already put these new skills to the test.However, I would like to see a little more on gracefully turning down unsuitable candidates."
2,flimsy,"These bibs are so thin and flimsy that just getting one out to wear will tear the neck strip. If it doesn't then it will when you put it on. That's why you get 300. They're made cheaply. If you get these, buy tape."
4,Terrific for new ASP programmers,"If you are one of the many programmers who have recently moved to ASP -- you will greatly appreciate this book. This was the first book I read that fully explores how to leverage the technology you already know well (VB, C++, or Java -- with examples throughout) and leverage that to write powerful ASP Components (DLLs) that can do most of the work you need including data access and HTML generation. Theres a textbook examination of COM for those who like that sort of thing, but you can jump right in to the parts on MTS and separate sections on the development tool of your choice. Well worth studying."
4,Excellent book on the topic,"I have Professional ASP (Wrox) and was looking for a book to go in depth into the theory, design and implementation of COM objects for ASP.This is the book I went with and I'm very satisfied with the way this book is written and the material it covers. The author does an excellent job at explaining things like:* The advantages a VC++ COM developer may have over a VB COM developer.* The ScriptingContext and the ObjectContext objects that can you instance, why one is right for any development using Transact Server and why.* Equal coverage of COM development using VB, VC++ and Java.Only four stars because I would have liked a few more illustrations and a CD-ROM or at least some source code I could download would have been nice.Do not get this book if you are a beginner to VB/ASP, you need to get some fundimentals down before you go here."
3,A good start...,"A good book but the examples are not really that great. I suggest reading several other books on this subject (ASP,COM,DCOM,MTS). I personally would have liked to have seen more challenging material."
5,_The_ book to learn ASP component development,"This book is the best introuduction I have seen to writing ASP Components. It is very easy to read, gives a lot of walkthroughs and has enough content to keep you happy till you get to the next level. I am particularily happy with the sections on Java COM, there really is not enough information out there for Java programmers."
5,This book is simply MUST BUY !!!,"Working in ASP technology for 3 years (since before ASP has been publically available) I've read or skimmed probably every book that has to do with ASP Development. This book is just GREAT. A book on Component Building has been much needed and THIS one is a bullseye. I especially like the fact that examples are in VB, Java, and C++. There's also a great discussion of the Metabase and the Admin objects. If you wanna go beyond novice - get this book !!!!"
4,Green Nose,This is a very good book to teach children that they do not have to follow the crowd and do as others do. It is important to have your own individuality and be yourself.
5,Flesh-color is best.,I read this story to a group of school-aged children. They talked about it for a couple of weeks. Great story to point out the foolishness of following the current fashion trend. The boys in Mohawk haircuts cringed as I read this story as did the girls in bare midriffs. I love the way Max Lucado teaches sound principles to children. He doesn't preach. He allows his audience to discover the truth he is teaching.
5,Our favorite book!,My son and I have been reading this book together for years and love it. It is such a wonderful and true story. A must read for every child and parent.
5,If Only I had a Green Nose (Max Lucado's Wemmicks),"What a wonderful story! I gave it to all the children on my Christmas list below the age of 10. Children have such a hard time with self esteem issues, this book helps them understand that it's okay to be yourself."
5,Great Book!,I would recommend this book to everyone! I love Max Lucado's books! Bought because I had gotten the bookYou are special!
5,God's Original Blueprint Design For A Human Being..........,....definitely does not call for us to search every dumpster out there trying to find who we are or how we fit in. This book sets the message straight for all who are trying to find ourselves. We are made in God's image!! What more could we ask for or even want? We fit in by God's unmeasureable grace and atonement for our sin. This book is great and I highly recommend it for parents of teens and those who may be emotionally and spiritually broken. God Bless You All!
1,Mediocre at best,"I found this book to be the literary equivalent of nails on a chalkboard. It's overtly didactic and singularly uninspired. Published in 2002, and it already seems dated. The illustrations are likewise nothing to get excited about. Nothing fresh or exciting here either, but the illustrator thinks enough of his own work that every page of the book has his signature in it--having his name on the cover wasn't enough, evidently."
2,it worked well until it broke,"the product itself worked well, i guess, although i've not tried any of the new oral care products. however, within a year it stopped taking a charge & now is just a decoration in my bathroom."
4,I love mine,"My boyfriend has the more expensive version and I had to get one for my home after trying his. This one isn't as powerful as the more expensive version, but I love it and it works great. Also, it is especially great if you have sensitive gums as it is not as harsh as the more powerful ones."
4,Very Effective,"This is a great product--notwithstanding the fact that it isn't likely to last for more than a year under normal use--but people should realize that this is NOT a toothbrush, but a plaque remover. Manual brushing can reduce soft tartar but has no effect on the hardened plaque that causes gums to recede and teeth to develop cavities.You should continue flossing and brushing manually 3 times a day, gently, for short periods of time. At the end of the week, brush and floss first, than carefully run the Braun plaque remover over of your teeth the same way your dentist does when he's cleaning them. Don't use toothpaste because that will only reduce the cleaning effect. If you use this product regularly, your plaque build-up will be much less of a problem, resulting in healthier teeth and gums, and less agony at the dentist's office."
1,not much dressage here,"I totally agree with john.davenport's comments. I read this book cover to cover not knowing anything about dressage. At the end, I STILL didn't know anything about DRESSAGE! The contents are just general horse-sense platitudes. But if you want to really understand the point of dressage, what its goals are, and how to begin to make progress towards dressage as a sport and a skill, then this book will be of no help whatsoever."
3,Grass Roots Symphonic Hits,"Nice CD.... wasn't sure what to expect, but it was a pleasant surprise.... the arrangements are nice & give new life to these tracks..... a ""MUST HAVE"" for loyal Grass Roots fans...."
3,mediocre,"the actual gun is alright, but the other stuff it came with is useless crap. Withen the first week the laser and light broke. My friend likes this gun more than me, and it's mine. I'd much rather use my M92 than this gun, its a pistol and it shoots17 fps faster."
5,Is this gun good?,I was wondering if this gun was any good. I think the picture looks really cool and it looks really good. I ordered it yesterday it is not here yet but hopefully it will come in the next few days. I hope this gun shoots pretty hard because im looking for a good springer. Hopefully is shoot 290-300 fps like it says. Hopefully I made the right choice in getting this gun and hopefully it suits me.
5,good,the gun is good but the laser and flashlight suck sling and grip are good the mag is also hard to take out some times comes with a good Manuel the sights are ok you can also mount a scope on it the sling points are metal the inner barrel is metal also the outer barrel is metal the mag is really thick abs weakest part is the hand guard it wobbles some and bends
1,Not the best,"I got this gun for my birthday. I was excited for it to come in. When I got it, came with no instructions. I put everything on it. It will fall off or parts will brake off. Just today, my stock broke off. The laser sight doesn't work to well."
1,Worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon.,"Awful. Sights didn't work. The ""LED illuminator"" was disappointing at the least. The stock broke as it was shouldered by my nephew. There was no protective shipping wrapper or box, the actual product box was simply taped up around the edges, the address slapped on, and shipped."
2,No longer non stick,"I have now owned a Swiss Diamond 12 inch, a 10 inch, and an 8 inch frypan for three years. First of all, I learned after purchase, that the coating used is the same product as Teflon, just not the brand. It is like buying generic medicines which can be exactly the same thing, but if you think you are avoiding Teflon coatings, that is not true. What appears to be true is the unique way it is applied to the fry pan.Just like Teflon, my Swiss Diamond pans have lost their non-stick property. They are still heavy, quality, expensive cooking utensils, just no longer non-stick. My cast iron fry pans ARE still non-stick."
5,'Florida Crackers' in love.,"This novel about two 'Florida crackers' marks a departure for the author famous for her complex accounts of black culture and heritage.of insights into the nature of love, attraction, faith, and loyalty.Seraph on the Suwanee is the story of two people at once deeply in love and deeply at odds. The heroine, young Arvay Henson, is convinced she will never find true love and happiness, and defends herself from unwanted suitors by throwing hysterical fits and professing religious fervor. Arvay meets her match, however, in handsome Jim Meserve, a bright, enterprising young man who knows that Arvay is the woman for him, and refuses to allow her to convince him otherwise. With the same passion and understanding that have made Their Eyes Were Watching God a classic, Hurston explores the evolution of a marriage full of love but very little communication and the desires of a young woman in search of herself and her place in the world."
1,Braun 5000/6000FC- Not good,"I am not happy..The replacement one does not work good...It does not shave clean..you have to use it 2-3 times...where as original one took one time shave...I guess afer wasting my 29$...I'll have to reinvest in a new electric shaver.Braun 5000/6000FC- XP 31B Flex Integral Foil/Cutterblock Replacement Pack, Black"
5,made my braun 5441 thats 10yrs old work like new,"finally a clean smooth shave. the top fits a little snug but thats comparing it to one thats been popped on and off a few hundred or thousand times. the old cap had a little give in it so i assume after this one is broken-in, it'll be the same. i couldn't be happier, smooth shave that costs much less than a new razor."
4,Braun 5000/6000 FC -XP Flex foil and cutter,I am not sure this is the right foil for my shaver. I have the Braun 5614 model and I can never find parts for that model. But it works very well. The screen doesn't pop off when you press the release button but it pulls off easily while you are pushing the release button. It does well on all parts of the face except the neck. I haven't found anything that does a real good job on the neck hairs.
4,Braun 5315 replacement foil,"I like the convenience of the elctric shaver because it saves time in the morning. I have to be out the door by 6:30 am to make it roughly 50 miles down the road by 7:30 am. So you can see that this is a ""close shave"" in more ways than one. The Braun 5315 is probably the best electric I've owned because it never discharges, no matter if I forget to charge it for an extra day. I only have one gripe. It's very hard to get this foil, even online."
1,did not fit,Product did not fit and was returned to the vendor. Web site description was innacurate.
4,"A nice product, but not like there's any options","This is a nice screen for your razor, but it's not like there's any alternatives. I did try a 3rd party screen for my last replacement, and it fell apart in less then a week--that's right, literally fell apart. The Braun branded screens are a much better quality and hold up for the full expected lifetime. I *would* be nice to get some real competition to drive the price down, but what do you expect..."
4,Exactly what I needed,"I was glad to find this on Amazon, as my shaver was in need of a refresh. I like the idea of a subscription to this product, but the only time periods offered are far too short."
5,What a relief!,New and sharp is sooo much more comfortable than old and dull. The replacement parts made my razor new again.
5,Wonderful Product and a third of the normal $$$!!!!,I bought this to replace the one on my razor. It was about a third of the normal cost of the ones we have here at the local store!!!I would buy this again and again!!!
3,Braun Shaver,"The product arrived on the date that I was given. After inserting the new blades, the razor works almost like brand new!!"
4,Braun 5000/6000 Replacement Cutterblock,The product works well. It cuts close to the face and leaves a clean shave. It feels like a new shaver.
4,Great shave hard to grip,"This razor gives a great shave with little effort and no razor burn. The shape of the razor leaves bit to be desired though. It is hard to hold for the time necessary to shave an area. The shape lends itself to hand cramps. Easy to clean, recharges quickly great blades, sharpness wise. All in all I would recommend this to any one seeking a great shave with little effort and burn."
4,"Better cut, not a perfect fit","I have a Braun 5000-series, and while this is supposed to fit any model starting with a ""5"", it's not a perfect fit. The foil pops on easily, but pushing the side release button no longer pops it off. You have to pull a little. The cutterblock was a perfect fit, though.That said, the foil and cutter were big improvements. The new foil design helps catch tough beard hairs faster. Replacing the cutter made a huge difference, as I had been using mine for a couple years, at least.Save yourself some time in the morning and upgrade your shave!"
4,New Package = Same Part ?,"I had replaced the Foil/Cutterblock several times using the Braun 6000 replacement for my Braun 6550. The ""new"" 6000FC-BKnow replaces both the 5000 and 6000 series - it seems to work fine but caused concern when I first received it."
4,Replacement blade does the trick!,I have had my Braun shaver for at least 10 years. The manufacturer recommends replacing the cutter block every 18 months. Hogwash! It performed well up to the last month or two so I ordered this replacement from Amazon and am perfectly satisfied that I have another 5 years' life for this razor.
5,Shaver head,The shipment arrived promptly as promised. It was the right item. I'm using it and it works perfectly.Well done.
2,Screen cracked and broke,This is my second order. The first one cracked and broke within a few weeks. So far this one has held up for a month. Hopefully it will last years just like the original screen did.
3,Larousse Gastronomique Recipe Collection,"Recipes are great, the setout is logical and easy to index. Very disappointed in the presentation. The books are advertised as hardcover but that is just the surround, the books themselves are low quality paperbacks."
3,very nice,Very resourceful and extensive information. I was surprised at the size of the book(larger that I anticipated).
2,Weird and confusing,"I know this book was supposed to be clever, but I found it to be very confusing. There were so many characters thrown at the reader in the first two or three chapters, that when those characters reappeared later in the book it was hard to remember who they were or what role they had played earlier. I also found the constant jumping from one scene to another hard to follow.I am an avid reader and it is RARE that I ever quit reading a book before I reach the end, but I am about two thirds of the way through and am thinking about tossing this one. Maybe it redeems itself in the end, but I'm finding it a chore rather than a pleasure to persevere. Time is just too precious and there are so many good books out there."
2,Not enough pressure,"I read the reviews of other buyers, that there was not enough pressure to properly clean out food particles between teeth, but because I have used and liked Braun products before, I bought the Oxyjet anyways.I can only say that, if you are looking for a device to replace flossing in a pinch, this is nothing close. Even on the highest setting, there was barely enough pressure to dislodge even larger particles.I have braces, and because flossing is sometimes a 20 minute ordeal, I like to have the option to use an oral irrigator in a pinch.SO....even to Braun fans like myself, if you expect cleaning power, keep looking."
1,Not enough pressure,"I am using a Water Pik oral irrigator for years and always wanted this unit, because Braun products are usually superior, and if it is just for looks...Beware of this unit, however, if you want strong water pressure, which will really remove food from between your teeth and give you a good gum massage,(which is essential in preventing those bloody 'pockets' from developing between tooth and gum which are called Gingivitis);this unit won't deliver. ...."
1,Terrible,"I bought one and it didn't work at all. Maybe I just got a bad one, but since I had such a bad experience with the first one I'd like to try something else."
1,NOT A CLASSIC,"As a book of any relevance or knowledgeable value to the case evidence of the Loch Ness enigma this volume is virtually worthless. Factually inaccurate in many areas it provide no new information or data and simply retraces old ground. Recommended if you are a collector and simply want to own the volume, but not recommended if it is accurate information you require."
3,outdated but some interesting basics,The book has some interesting history of the area but the information is a bit outdated and not as insightful as I had hoped. If you really want some insights into the area this is not the book as you probably can get as much information from AAA or the local chambers.
1,Lousy!,"After getting this make believe product I wrote to the distributor of Bookbinder's soups and Bookbinder's in Philadelphia to give them my opinion of their snapper soup. This isn't even close to what Old Original Bookbinder's soup should taste like. It is thin and the only additional item that you can chew is not Snapper, but carrots. It is the worst I have ever tasted, period.It was also reassutring to me to just this week have a food commentator say the exact same thing that I said. It is a make believe Snapper soup."
1,No Meat,"Just horrible. I found almost no meat in the soup. I used to eat this every Christmas, but this year it was terrible. I will never buy this brand again."
1,Gone Terribly Wrong,"I used to buy this stuff by the case since I lived in Georgia and it was hard to find. Have not had any on a few years, but this current version is absolutely HORRIBLE! Do not waste your money for you will be very disappointed by this sham of a ""snapper soup"". Bookbinder's (or whoever owns the rights to the name) ought to be ashamed of what they did to what used to be a very good product."
1,Blah,"Blah, not sure what it's supposed to taste like but this cant be it. No meat found. Tasted like turmeric and tomato vegetable gravy?"
5,Tastes like home,Used to live on 2 street not far from Bookbinder's. A real taste of home that I've missed until now.
2,Something has changed...,"I am writing this after having eaten this soup for lunch. Something has gone terribly wrong here. I have enjoyed this soup quite frequently in the past. Until fairly recently, this soup has been consistently good. The taste was correct, just the right amount of sherry, and enough turtle to satisfy my normally generous standards. This last serving has prompted me to search the Internet for the source of the problem; no turtle and far too much tomato. As I have alluded to earlier, this is not consistent with the past history of this product. Something has gone very terribly wrong here..."
1,There is no turtle. None. What on earth happened?,"There's something funny going on when your main soup ingredient is listed almost dead last on the list, right before caramel color. Three lumps of textured vegetable protein, no bigger than a fly... they're saying this is turtle? Are they using the water from a snapper's territory to make the broth? Looks like the supply of turtle meat has dried up.This soup is for all intents and purposes vegetarian, but with almost no protein. It's still somewhat tasty but without meat you're just having a bowl of gravy for lunch."
1,Turtle Soup with no turtle,"one star is too generous for this soup, or should I say broth. The soup label is just a myth. There was hardly anything in this soup other than liquid. I still have 8 cans left and cannot give it away. I do not recommend this soup to anyone."
1,Used to be the Best...Now a Rip-Off,"Just had a can. What a Rip-Off. How dare they market this as ""Bookbinder's"" Snapper Soup. Should be marketed as ""the cheap knock-off of Bookbinder's Snapper Soup sold at the same Premium Price.""No meat...all I could taste was corn starch. Well yes...there was a hint of the original spicing....a hint.This is not the same soup that I used to buy with the same labled soup can.The worst part is that I can no longer get true Bookbinder's Snapper Soup. Thanks a lot for nothing.The lable also shows a very ""chunky"" soup. There are no chunks of anything. Maybe?...some specs of some vegies."
1,Bookbinder's NO SNAPPER Soup,This company has ripped off the consumer by not making it condensed like it used to so you get less soup for a can of it. PLUS NO MEAT IN IT WHATSOEVER. They SHOULD be ashamed of themselves!
3,developing person through childhood,"As far as text books go, its set up nicely. First few chapters are a little boring but there is a lot of information."
2,Wrong Edition,"I purchased this text book for a class. It turns out the description on Amazon is not updated. They must use a general description, which says this is the 8th edition. I actually received the fifth edition. This is a big problem if your book is required for a class. By the time I realized the discrepancy, I had already read and highlighted 7 chapters for my first class. From then on, I was always off on page numbers and info because I had the wrong version. Be very careful purchasing text books from Amazon, when the edition matters."
4,Thanks!!!,Fast Delivery and the book was in good condition. Would definitely buy from in the future.
1,Awful Flicker Problem and Samsung Deception,"I purchased this product on Amazon in October 2007. It was very easy to set up and had a very bright screen. However, I quickly noticed that colors between light blue and dark grey had a constant horizontal flickering. The darker the color (except black) the worse the flickering was. I began to research this produce more online and found that there are actually three different classes of this product model - A, S, and C. One of these models is made by Samsung and the other two are outsourced to worse companies. It is now impossible to tell which model you get unless you take the thing apart. Reading many reviews, if you received one made by Samsung, it is of good quality. But if you received one made by either of the two other companies, the monitor is horrible.I would not recommend buying this product to anyone. The constant flickering is so annoying and strenous on the eyes."
4,Beautiful but doesn't work with my MAC G5,"The monitor is quite beautiful. Unfortunately it doesn't work with my MAC G5 so I'm giving it to someone with a PC. On looks alone, I wish I could use it."
4,Excellent Color and Quality,Great Color and Image reproduction.Use it for photoshop and we happily recommend it.Lacks physical adjustments.The stand that comes in the box is not height-adjustable.
4,Monitor Great - Cable terrible,"I use The lcd with my HP Pavilion Notebook (vista) and docking station so I can have a dual monitor setup. Mostly for office and computer work, some video.I had large waves of light rippling across my screen for a couple of weeks before I had the time to really figure out what was going on. I was ready to take it back when I figured it out. Apparently the lcd is very very sensitive to power noise and fluctuations. So a simple upgrade to a real shielded VGA cable fixed it. Now it looks wonderful.I have never seen a monitor cable so thin... why even include a cord if it could affect your product so negatively?"
3,Not bad for the price.,"This monitor does exactly what I want it to do: gives me more desktop space and enough color to edit photos casually. This is not the highest quality monitor, but it isn't the worst. My monitor does display some ""bleeding"" on the edges. But honestly, it isn't noticeable unless you are watching a movie with black edges around it. I've grown to be OK with it.PLUS, I own a Macbook Pro. And will not have a DELL or Gateway on my desktop.. Cliche. So I settled for the Samsung. The 22"" size is almost necessary if you really want more space. In widescreen, anything less doesn't seem substantially bigger.Happy Shoppin"
1,"WORK!! WORK, YOU BASTARD, WORK!!","[...] and nothing but headaches. After a mere two years it started flickering. First for a few minutes, then for hours, then forever. Tried everything. Nothing. Piece of crap! Shame on you, Samsung!!"
2,"Large screen, but software a problem.","Hooking up the monitor hardware was easy. The two software programs keep/kept saying ""This computer does not support magice tune"". Checked the drivers. All compatible. Broken English response message from company said to get driver update. Did that. My drivers are on their list. I have an 2004 INTEL P4 3.00GHZ 800MHZ FSB. My driver is NVIDIA GeForce 5200. Didn't need the headache and hours trying to get the software to run."
5,Samsung SyncMaster 226BW 22-inch LCD Monitor,Great . . . . This is an Excelent Product . . . 100% Recommended . . . . .
1,Samsung service is negative....very poor!,"Owned monitor for business use. After 2 months monitor died. Tried to get a replacement...14 business days quoted. 21 days later and 120 minutes on hold, based upon timer on phone, (just counting today), still no answer. Computer screen said it shipped, 2 customer service people said it shipped (they just read the screen) when I asked for a tracking number...they found out they had not shipped it. Still on hold now as I write this. Waiting for another supervisor.My recommendation...do not buy this for business...you can not afford the down time and the brain damage. Ed Allbright"
3,It is okay but NOT great!,This is a good LCD monitor for the price that you pay for it. It would be better if a pair of internal speaker be added in this unit.
4,Very big and bright,"My last computer was a laptop with a 15.4"" screen and now, upgrading to this screen (which is more than 2x bigger), is just like being in heaven.With that being said, Amazon kind of lied about the 3000:1 contrast ratio. It's actually 700:1 if you look at the Samsung website and it only has 3000:1 contrast ratio under certain conditions.Otherwise, it's what you'd want out of a screen: it's fast, bright, and big."
1,C panel still exists,"Somebody says Samsung stoped shipping C panel or panels from Mexico are S panel.It is not true.I got my 226 BW Sep24 2007.After couple of hours of use, I thought the panel can not be S or A since it had gohst and bad color.However, back of the panel did not say S,A or C.So, I did a last way to check the panel type.found out it was ""M220Z1 Rev.C1."" Yes, it was C panel.I felt so disappointed.Go ahead and buy it if you want to pay around $270 and have a chance getting C panel.Last word-the quality of C panel is.... just.... bad."
2,"Great for 3 years, then began flickering on and off","This monitor was great for 3 years, great size, color, contrast, etc. I am a professional photographer and used it to edit photos. However, the past month, it has been terrible. It flickers on and off after it has been either in sleep mode or off. The flickering lasted for 5 min. at first, but over the past month, the time has increased to 15 - 20 min. After that time, it returns to normal. While flickering, it is difficult to see anything on the monitor. It is extremely frustrating, as a monitor should last longer than 3 years! 5 - 7 years would be more reasonable."
3,Difficult Setup,"This monitor is extremely difficult to set up. I used the native Mac utility and the Samsung one. Both provided some good colors and some bad. I think I tried over 10 times before I was satisfied. Initially, the darker colors, looked great. But the yellow and green were horrible. They were extremely bright which made the monitor unusable.Pros: Screen size is awesome; Rotating the screen horizontally over 180 degrees is awesome;Cons: Difficult setup!"
4,"Samsung 22""",Product was well priced and timely as per the order information and operates as expected. Clarity is excellent!
3,Only one major flaw,"This is an okay monitor. You cannot see off axis vertical very well, but the only really big problem is that they went cheap on not putting an adjustable stand on it. I've had to put a wedge under it to get it at the right angle for viewing. Very annoying. Other than that it's a good cheap monitor."
1,Broke after 4 months.,"This monitor broke after I had it for 4 months. I'd steer clear of it. Also, I never liked it when it did work. If you're sitting a few inches below looking straight at it, it would get really dark at top."
5,Best Monitor Period!!!!!!!!!!!!!,When I got it out the box and I can say this was a very big monitor and colorful. I recommend a very good video card if you are using it to play games.
3,Nice but...,"The monitor has a nice image but we are running into some issues with it that I am still trying to work out. this monitor is being used in a graphic design environment. We are using this on a Mac system and cannot get the contrast-color balance to adjust into acceptable parameters. Even with the brightness turned all the way down, according to the test chartused in the Macintosh color calibration tool, the screen is still too bright. We went onto the Samsung website and downloaded a Samsung propritory color adjustment tool that appeared to be for our operating system and our monitor. However, once loaded the tool would not work. I haven't given up and intend to consult with Samsung support, but for now we are still needing to use a second monitor for color accuracy. So, I cannot give this monitor the rave review I WANT TO."
4,Good - had problem - Samsung tech helped!,"I bought this monitor new eight months ago.It performed well until recently. . .colors went off. . .blacks were not deep and rich and it would not produce a good rich brown.The monitor has a three year parts and labor warranty.I called Samsung and got a tech support guy on the phone on a Saturday evening (5:30 pm west coast time).Basic trouble shooting required turning monitor off, pulling all connections (even though still hot), then plugging power back in. . .wait till the floating red green blue box comes up. Then plug the video cable in (still hot).That reset the monitor to original configuraton. Colors are better and I'm happy with the results.This is a Samsung SyncMaster 226BW ""C"" series monitor.I use it with a MacPro plugged into the DVI and a PC plugged into the analog side.It gets a four star because it gave me this problem."
3,Excellent while it works...,"After over 3 years of good use, and now past warranty, this monitor now has an annoying flicker that lasts about 5 minutes after startup. While it is flickering, it is unusable. This condition does go away, but every day when I start my computer, the flicker lasts a little longer. I will be looking to replace this monitor in the near term. The bottom line is that even knowing that this would happen, I probably would still have purchased this monitor... I just wish it would have lasted longer."
2,Poor customer service,"The monitors are ok, but the customer service is poor. I purchased two monitors and a new (required) video card--NDVA. The monitor and cards are not compatible with Samsung's Magic Tune (computer adjustment of the monitor) with the card. I can't get any of the manufacturers to solve the problem. A lot of money for two relatively newly designed monitor and relatively new video card that are not compatible."
3,"Poor Design, but great pictures","I have owned this for 3 years and 4 months. The matte screen is great. I get a great picture on normal functions. HD is not great quality, ok, but not great. Easy to set up and install.Now, the biggest flaw. for the past 2 years, i cannot turn the monitor off. The monitor has to stay on. If it goes to sleep or gets turned off, you have to smack the monitor very hard multiple times to get it to come back on. I think the bulbs/filaments are bad or there is a bad connection. Overall, i am not happy with this flaw. I just keep it on and can use a screensaver but can't turn it off or put it in sleep mode. I will be looking for a new one soon. Just wish this would have lasted longer for total functionality.Stay away from samsung monitors. HP, Viewsonic and MAC are the best out there..."
4,samsung 226BW feedback,This is my second monitor from Samsung.The first being a Syncmaster 204B has better resolution than 226BW. The new monitor is well built and looks great. Works perfectly and I wish it came with more that 1680X1050 resolution.
5,"They made it through warranty, 3 years, 4 months old now","I bought one of these on 4-27-07 from Circuit City, and another from Staples on 9-27-07 (later we bought another for my son from Staples). I run the two I have on the same computer.When I bought them I made sure to get the correct panel manufacturer model (was it ""S""?, can't remember) that was made by Samsung and preferred, and that is why I bought them locally. So I could look at the letter that was displayed on the boxes at that time.So, as I write this, even the newest one is out of warranty by 1 month, given the 3 month extension to 3 years and 3 months for registering online (if Samsung would have honored it).Mine have worked well. No complaints.FWIW, both displays are running at 60Hz on the same nVidia GeForce 8600GT-OC 512Mb card, 1680 x 1050 screen resolution, and 32 bit color quality."
5,Very Satisfied,"I purchased the 22-inch wide screen to use with a new gaming computer. I have very good graphics playing Crysis and while surfing the net. The Crysis game does not fill the whole screen, but while doing other work, it does."
5,Wow,"I received a Samsung 226BW which was made in Mexico, as clearly marked on the package.I could not be more pleased. Zero dead/stuck pixels. On a black screen at max brightness, light bleed is barely visible for a few mm at the top and bottom edges. This is of no practical concern.Text, internet, photo and DVD playback are all great.The wide screen is definitely a plus for spreadsheets and side by side word processing.This is my third Samsung monitor, all of them have been great."
3,Great if you already know what he's talking about,"As with one of the other reviewers I am currently languishing in the confusion of the 1st few chapters. Basically I think the author is trying to cover too much ground too quickly and is assuming a level of knowledge which I don't have. If I had it I wouldn't be reading this book.This is in fact rather similar to his other book, Cisco TCP/IP Routing Professional Reference. While I followed the theory in that book I remember thinking that no novice would have a hope of grasping such a terse exposition of TCP/IP fundamentals.I'll carry on plugging away and maybe add a final review. The major difference here though is that there don't seem to be any other books where one can find a more approachable explanation of the basics of LAN Switching technologies. Therefore I wish he had slowed down somewhat.I really don't believe the book deserves the 5 stars awarded by other reviewers unless there's pure gold from Chapter 4 on."
2,Good but leaky,I enjoyed the popcorn but I had to be careful because all but 1 package had butter leak outside of the popcorn bag. The butter did not leak from the plastic film luckily.
5,Corn on the Cob Microwave Popcorn,This is the best microwave popcorn that I have found. It really tastes like you are eating corn on the cob. Hard to find in retail stores.
1,Every pack was expired!,"I had been looking for this for the past few months because when I was able to get it at Safeway, it was great! Tasted like Corn on the Cob. Found it on Amazon and ordered a case. Big mistake! I popped a few bags and they were all expired as it turns out. The finished product was orange and covered in greasy oil like stuff."
3,Good Tasting Popcorn,For microwave popcorn this has a very good taste. I wish it did not have so many hulls and it is much better when served hot.
5,Awsome!!!,I love this popcorn and this was such a bargin price compared to store price. Thanks Amazon!!!
1,unworthy,Not at all what I hoped it would be. Missing lots of flavor.I had purchased Act ll Corn on the Cob and had hoped this would be as good.It's just popcorn. Could have saved myself some money. I gave most of the boxes away. Still looking for the Act ll brand.
1,Why does it contain FISH GELATIN?,"Have a look at those ingredients folks and learn to read those labels carefully. I love popcorn of all kinds and was intrigued to find this at a local grocery store. I'm glad I read the label before I popped a bag because it says right there on the box Contains: FISH and MILK. Why is FISH in ANY popcorn ingredient? I called the 800 number on the box and they told me it wasn't fish, it was ""fish gelatin"" (like that makes it any better).I've gone back to pan popping with regional, small farm popcorns from around the country. This is *echh*!"
2,Just does not taste like it should,I ordered the Corn on the Cobb popcorn since I could not find it in Phoenix anymore. It tasted just like regular buttered popcorn. In the past the popcorn literally tasted like Corn on the Cobb. My family fought over it! Not anymore!
5,"V377, no issues in order / product. Good to buy.","I purchased this product for my wrist Watch and have had no issues in ordering, receiving and using the product. definitely its much cheaper then going to walmart spending 5 USD for just a simple battery replacement."
3,Swift shipping...but couldn't use it.,"Excellent service, but it would have been nice to see a dimension. Turns out I misread the clock insert that suggested the battery by one digit, and the battery was TOO tiny. My dad was able to use it for something else, so I gave it to him."
4,Potter is fantastic,I read this book when I was at college and never forgot it. The great illustrations and tricks are sensational. He understands all essentials in life! In addition to the fim he also acts incredibly well.
1,bogus pirated dvd,"This is the worst product I have ever bought. I can get enough energy to return it to the merchant. The dvd won't play on my dvd player and keep getting error messages. Contacted the vendor and they advised me to return it. Read review from a diffrent customer who had purchased the same dvd a while back, and they continue to sell it surely knowing that it don't work. Not sure why amazon allows these people to sell pirated music."
5,Great workout!,This DVD provides a great lower and upper body workout with weights. I'm use to hour long body pump classes. This is a nice alternative.
4,Decent workout,"I am advanced exerciser and found this workout to be beneficial. I didn't particularly like all of the time spent on switching the weights, but the DVD allows you to skip to the beginning of each exercise. The exercises are thorough and can be challenging with the right weight. Although, I didn't find the workout extremely challenging (as I prefer), I did find the moves to be effective."
3,Great shave but base broke after 7 months,"Smooth comfortable shave. Base system keeps the razor charged and clean. Needs cleaning liquid more often than I expected. Needed a new screen after 6 months. After 7 months the top piece of the base no longer stays on the razor, the catch slips. I use a piece of tape to hold it down when charging/cleaning. It's covered by the 2 year warranty but it's a pain to have to send it back after so short a period of time."
3,"Shaver Pretty good, cleaner/charger base not so good...","I enjoy using the shaver but after a few months it became increasingly hard to get the top part of the charger base to click down onto the shaver and stay. I would have to jiggle it repeatedly.Now after a year, it wont stay locked at all. So if I want to use the auto cleaning feature, I have to use rubber bands to try and hold it closed. That is a really such a pain that I rarely use it anymore except to trim my moustache.The shaver itself is probably the best one I have ever used."
4,"Shave, Clean, & Charge!","I can't rave enough about the Braun Syncro! It is the best shave I've ever gotten out of an electric. I will say that the blade is still closer, but you get 95% there without the mess or skin irritation. The biggest advantage is that you never have to clean or oil it manually. Just drop it into the Clean & Charge base and forget about it. It is always clean and ready to go! This unit also has the longest charge-hold that I've ever seen. I only need 3-4 minutes to shave each day, so the shaver only has to charge about once every 2 weeks! There is one drawback that I have found: The unavailability of the cleaning cartridges. Hardly anyone carries this little cartridge. I visited the large retailers in my areaincluding Wal-Mart, Target, and K-Mart and no one carries it. A Target employee said they did carry them, but wouldn't be stocking them anymore. I would hate to have to buy them directly from Braun."
3,"Average Shave, Nice bells and Whistles","As electric shavers go, this one is OK. It's better than the Norelco but not quite as good as the latest Remington triple-head. Of course, it's not as loud as the Remington either. But, let's face it, if you want a close shave, you're going to have to use a blade and shaving cream or gel. It takes about twice as long (or longer) to get a decent shave with any electric. However, this shaver is fun because of the cleaning feature and the various LED readouts on the deluxe model. It's hard to rate its longevity because I've only had it a few weeks. The motor seems to drag where my beard is heaviest. Also, the fan in the cleaning unit sounds like it's struggling to get up to speed during the drying mode of the cleaning operation. To sum up: a fun toy but nothing to write home about."
2,Buyer Beware,"My Braun 7570 arrived yesterday. I owned a Braun electric razor many years ago and was disappointed with it, so I quickly went back to shaving with a blade. I recently decided to give electric razors another chance and following some research, I ended up buying another Braun. After my first shave, I noticed two things: (1) electric razors seem to have improved over the years in terms of their ability to provide a close shave, but not by much; (2) my Braun ""Clean & Charge"" unit was broken and will probably have to be replaced. Apparently some flimsy rubber part inside the shaver receptacle has broken off or was missing in the first place.You would be best advised to stay away from this razor but if you are determined to buy one, you probably won't find a better price than Amazon.com's. It certainly lured me in."
2,Great self-cleaning but not a great shave.,I have owned this shaver for 15 months. The self- cleaning works great and a cleaning cartride lasts 5- 6 weeks...As the razor got older the quality of the shave went down hill. It now takes me 6 minutes to finish a shave(a very long time). I had a new screen (a hole developed in the screen) and blades installed...when it was about 1 year old. It did not improve the qality of my shave. I have decided to give up and buy a new wet/dry razor.
2,Service after the sale?,"I purchased this shaver and was very satisfied with the shave and the self-cleaning feature. The problem arose when the self cleaning mechanism failed and I tried to get service! I mailed it off meticulously following instructions. It was returned some weeks later - not fixed!! I called a number of places and finally found someone from Gillete (which takes care of this product). The clerk told me that a replacement would be ""on the way."" If someone could help me find out the status of that mailing I would appreciate it. In sum, great product. Great brand -- unless it breaks. Buyer beware."
1,I sent it back for a refund because it's SO BAD,"I hate this shaver. It all sounds good, but it doesn't deliever when you need a shave. It took on average about 10 minutes for me to shave with this ""shaver"". I would have to dig into my face and under my chin for it to actually work. I used it for about 9 months, that's right, 9 months. At first I figured it was a bad shave because my face need to adjust from my old electric razor to this new Braun. Then I thought I was shaving incorrectly. I did everything in the manual, shaved before showering, then I tried after, etc. Nothing worked. So finally a few days ago I sent Braun.com a message telling them how bad it is and then called me and are having me send this piece of [junk] back to them so they can send me a refund. I was recommended this shaver by a friend, he loves it...I HATE it."
3,High Tech Braun sinks below expectations!,"Having purchased this razor in April from Walmart I find that it matches the performance of my Norelco brand $75. Yes, it's definately more sleek and carries a sleek display and holder, yet for the hefty price, the performance just doesn't add up. I'm a Physician and enjoy a clean smooth shave twice a day during my long shifts here at UNC-Chapel Hill, and I am still yet searching for the perfect razor which does its job..Materialism and fashion make this style a hero! Performance on the other hand needs attention!"
1,stay away,This product may be great but the one I received was broken and the company I got it from never returned my emails or calls. Thank goodness for the A-Z guarantee.
3,IPOD Playing Football Shaped Pillow,This pillow looks great on your bed in a sports decor bedroom. It is a fun way to listen to your IPOD while laying in bed. The noise isn't loud enough to hear unless you are laying your head on the pillow. This is great for kids who fall asleep while listening to music since the IPOD cords are hidden within the pillow itself.
3,Allegories,I found the book rather disappointing and rather predictable but as I only wanted to read it as a 'genre' I guess it was OK. Certainly not up to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels.
5,Spirits of Nature is A Profound Reading Experience,"The Spirits of Nature by Dr. Livraga is a must read for those individuals interested in a truly comprehensive approach to this type of knowledge. The first two chapters of the book set a tone for the rest of the book and displays an enormous vision which the writer posseses which is both philosophical and practical.There is a chapter where the author explains how to see these invisible beings and even how to communicate with them. The book goes far beyond the superficial and superstitious, so often found in ""esoteric books"" and explains everything with seriousness, thoroughness and a wonderful gentleness and appreciation for this magical world.The book is a treasure and is highly reccomended.David Hirschorn Coral Gables, Florida"
4,"Kind of short, but still worth it","It seems like the author was a bit too selective. I would have liked a huge book of designs, not just a short book of the best ones, but for the price, I'm very satisfied with what I got.Vikings put designs on literally everything, and in places you would never see, such as the inside of a belt buckle, or the back of a writing tablet."
4,"worth gracing yer shelf, matey...","Fun read, though I do wish it had a bit more historical info. This is really designed for the illustrator/tattoo artist and does have some tidbits about the history behind all that twisty-lined goodness."
5,Good Deal,They provided a good service. I cant hold Sheri accountable for the long mailing wait or the book final condition since the post office is responsible. Sheri did a great job and even send back a reply when I asked what is taking so long. Very professional.
2,Should have known better,"I was very disapointed with this book. But I should have known, Dover Publications tends to produce shoddy material. I was not impressed with the quality of the art work. I expected to see clearer designs. It looked to me like they let a five year old trace some pictures from a history book.All though it is from a different culture I would recomend Celtic Designs by Chris Down. The artwork is amazingly clear and very reproducable! If you see this book then you will know exactly why Viking Designs is such a let down!"
1,Doesn't work,"I don't understand all these positive reviews. I have used this product for many months, hoping it might eventually make a difference. I've used it on deep wrinkles, barely-there wrinkles, and everything in between. No effect at all. Nada. Nothing. I'm sorry I wasted my money. No wonder the manufacturer has discontinued this product. :-( Save your money."
3,"Buy two, get one good and one bad","The price is good, but i hv got one good and one leaking staffs. They should checked products before they packed."
1,I was delivered a POOR imitation of the real product,It was a cheap imitation. Runny and smelled very bad!! It WAS NOT the product I buy in the stores
3,terriable smell,"It smell terriable,I don't like this fragrance,like human manufacture! It didn't like I brough form other country,I suspect it original one or OEM one."
2,No visible results,"The only good thing I can say about this stuff is that it's the rare product that didn't irritate my skin. It has, however, also had no discernible effect on the lines on my face."
2,smell no good...,when i open this smell no good im not use it...i never buy this again..and from cvs.... ohh well bad for me this product
1,Don't waste your $$$,"This product says it helps with fine lines and wrinkles, but in fine print on the box. It says that it doesn't work for wrinkles. I bought two of them and did not write this until I used this product for 2 months. I saw no improvement what-so-ever. No wonder it was so cheap. I don't have a lot of wrinkles, but wanted to stop the small ones that have started showing up since I turned 41. Didn't work. I hope this helps anyone who is also looking for something to keep those lines at bay. This won't help."
3,Product is really moisturizer,"Product is OK. Really a moisturizer. Does nothing for ""wrinkles"".Price was right. Would never buy if at full retail."
1,old product,"i usually love this product from loreal. and was excited that it was sold at a great price...but this will be a lesson on getting what you pay for! you can immediately tell this product was an older expired version product just on the smell that comes with cosmetic items that have been sitting on a shelf for a long time. (i have a legit version of it that has a pleasant smell). i tried to look for an expiration or ANY date on the box but couldn't find it. the box alone should have been a red flag as i think it's an older box. so i'm not sure if the contents are even effective anymore, just has a strong rancid ""old"" smell. but the annoying smell of the product will be a constant reminder that i went for a cheap price and not quality."
2,Didn't work for me,I purchase the product based on the positive reviews. I love the smell and the smoothness but it didnt do anything for my wrinkles. I really was hoping for this to work but it just didnt for me. So I'm off to search for other products to help with the newly forming wrinkles I'm developing...
3,Inexpensive,"Smells nice and super inexpensive to others I've tried. I don't really have wrinkles and I am lucky with decent skin. My problem is that I scowl naturally all the time- even in my sleep and have a huge, very deep, line between my brows, even when I am actively trying to relax my forehead. Anyway, I used to use Wexler's No Injection Line Filler and that stuff was MAGIC...both instant results and lasting results with repeated use. For whatever reason, some evil person decided to discontinue it, and I am on the hunt to find its replacement. THUS, the Wexler product has become the baseline, that I judge everything against. This L'Oreal stuff definitely doesn't work as well as the Wexler, but I do see a difference. I am not sure that I am using it for its intended use, but for my specific need, it is ""just ok"". I will continue using it and may even order it again if I can't find something else, but I will continue looking."
1,Item is discontinued - you get expired product,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It's been discontinued and you may get an old item like we did.My wife likes this product and couldn't find it in the stores anymore, so she purchased it here. What she received didn't smell good and was semi solid. Don't waste your money on this expired line, instead try their new RevitaLift Collagen Wrinkle Treatment."
1,what is the problem with the 8th Season ?,"I bought the whole collection of two and a half men,and when I get to the end I found that the 8th Season album has only dvd 1 and dvd 3and only the plastic where it should be the dvd 2, I contacted the seller and they were nice enough to send me a new 8th season to compelete my collection,Well, to my surprise I found the new album have ONLY dvd 1 and dvd 2 and there is no dvd 3,It is really strange to struggle for this tv series and I don't know WHY all this happening !!!!"
5,Great Popcorn at a Great Price!,This popcorn is the very best of popcorn with only 3-5 kernels that do not pop. Just the right amount of Butter flavor (except for those few times I add just a touch of melted butter) I probably consume 100 microwave bags a year and I have been eating popcorn for the last 50 years - This is the Best!
5,Fabulous stories that live up to the book's description !!,"Best collection of stories out there - not a dud in the entire book. I'm not as eloquent as the other reviewers but trust what they wrote, I'm glad I did."
3,Paperboy,"I bought this game after my boyfriend all but begged me to get it (""What do you mean you own a Sega but you don't own paperboy? That's crazy!""). It's fun enough, but takes some getting used to. It's not exactly my style (I prefer Wonderboy in Mosterland) and he's logged more time on it than I have, but you can still catch me playing it from time to time."
1,FOR EDITH DesMarais AND Anyone else wishing to read this,I read your review with interest. I had not tried the recipes in the book. I wanted to. What REALLY turned me off was that EVERYTHING is loaded with sugar and sweeteners. ANYTHING will be palatable if you sweeten it. The recipes are just so bad with all the added sweeteners.At one point the author mentions her husband and daughter love the stuff she made. No wonder. It's like candy!I can't believe the author actually eats like this. Forget menopause. What about the damage from all that sugar?
1,Warning regarding over dose of flax seed,"I was very enthusiastic regarding this book. The recipes were very well done and I did find great relief from menopausal symptoms. However, while traveling I relied on several ""portable"" flax seed foods for my daily ""portions"" for estrogen. Shortly thereafter, I was found to have a very irregular heart beat. I have no history of heart problems and, in fact, am an athlete. Research into flax seed showed that more than 2 ounces or 60 grams a day should not be taken internally. It can cause increased respitory rate, gasping, staggering, or convulsions. In early history, it was used as a heart medication - indicating a heart link. There is no warning in the book and in fact, the book encourages higher doses. Please use extreme caution in using these flax seed foods. Use only small amounts per day. There are beneficial amounts (very low doses), but it is toxic in small amounts as well if consumed regularly. There are no warnings on the flax seed bags in stores."
5,The Best!,"These are the best non-stick cookware I have ever used. Compared to other non-stick fry pans that I have used in the past, they have a heavy, sturdy feel. Better yet, they cook food beautifully and clean up easily. I am definitely saving my pennies to by other pieces by this company."
4,"Not as effective as flossing, but better than nothing. :P","I have been using mine for 1.5 years now. The irrigator works quite well if you have some reasonably-large gaps between your teeth. (You can find this out by flossing yourself once.) However, it still will not get the food residue that gets stuck between the teeth. So keep your dental floss around.Mine actually broke once during the warranty period (1 year). The pipe that leads to the irrigator handle is plastic and it loses its flexibility due to age. As a result it breaks due to the twisting force in the coil. So be ware.I have also decided that if it breaks the second time, then I will just switch back to flossing. Using this irrigator doesn't save me time and I really find flossing more effective."
1,Water pressure is too weak,"After using Waterpik for years, I find this Braun Oral irrigator set a waste of money. The water pressure is simply too weak."
4,a great product overall,i have to agree the oxyjet is not all that it is cracked up to be but the 3d plaque remover is great. it's smaller than its predecssors so it's great for travelling with too. Before I had problems keeping my teeth clean but now i don't and i have not had cavities in 7 years.If you have trouble brushing your teeth this product is for u.
2,No Power,"The OxyJet is useless. I had a very useful WaterPik 10 years ago which had 10 times the force than this OxyJet. Picked the Braun this time because of packaging and of their reputation and past experiences with their other products. Huge dissappointment with Braun. The only thing this is good for, is for my kid to play with.The 3D plaque remover on the other hand is great. But skip this product and you can get 2 plaque removers."
2,"Look's Good, Starts off good,","I was impressed at the looks, I was impressed with ecerything except the quality after using a oral hygene waterpik for several years, I had a 2nd one in less than 1 year and it has quit working, too much money and inconvenience for the price,"
2,The toothbrush is enough,"The irrigator is a little bit overkill, I just bought it because it was in my goldbox and I can't resist a sale. I like the toothbrush a lot though!"
3,Prince Outdoor Table Tennis Table,"The product was delivered in a box and looked new. However, when I installed it, the surface on one section of the table was bent a bit, so it is not level under where the net is. I was disappointed with the quality. The table looks sturdy and well made otherwise and the price is good compared to what is available from other sources."
3,"Math riddles, not quite so!","I am surprised to see so much praise in reviews posted here for a book that could so much better! To be sure, kids would be intrigued by learning from simple patterns of additions or multiplications, but the author should try more challenging problems. To wit, my seven-year old grandson did not find much of a learning tool here.Already our schools have lowered the bar; why do so in their fun-reading too?Let us try harder."
5,Math Made Fun for Everyone.....,"Greg Tang and partner, Harry Briggs are back with another innovative, seasonal counting book that's ready to challenge younger readers. Each clever problem, posed as a riddle, and told in engaging rhyme is enhanced with bold and vibrant, eye-catching, computer-generated illustrations. No more counting the old fashioned, slow way, one by one. Tang and Briggs help kids think creatively by looking for patterns and recognizing groupings. Little ones will feel a real sense of accomplishment as they begin to develop the problem solving skills and tactics they'll use for the rest of their lives. With a helpful hint included at the end of each rhyme to get you started, and a straighforward, easy to understand answer key at the end, youngsters 4-8 won't even know they're working on math problems. They'll just think they're just having fun! For those with older kids, be sure to get this dynmaic duo's first book of mind-stretchers, The Grapes Of Math."
5,Early Number Sense,"I just went through this book with my six year old son and he absolutely loved it! It shows different ways to think of counting objects by grouping them in easy multiples. I think it's a wonderful opportunity for kids to learn that there are many ways to solve a math problem, too. My son enjoyed explaining 'his way' and hearing 'my way'. It's a great book for early number sense (mental math) and has beautiful illustrations, too."
5,Math for All Seasons,"I've used this book with both my second graders and with college students in my math methods' class. I encourage the college students to use trade books as part of their daily instruction, and this is one I highly recommend!"
1,Save your money,My son was playing with these and within a hour it had cracked and there were lots of tiny metal balls all over the room. The other one broke within a couple of days!!
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I loved this product, until my 2yr old son unscrewed the maraca. I was worried he had swallowed some, because he is the type of child to put things in his mouth. The balls are made of steel. I called the company to ask them. I had a difficult time cleaning up the metal balls. There are about 30 of them in each maraca and are about a mm in size. I didn't even see them at first. I actually took the second maraca and busted it open (it took one good hit on the floor for me to open it) to see what I was looking for.Though the steel balls are not toxic, poisin control said that I should take my son to the Dr & get him an Xray.. The doctor said if the Xray came back positive they would do a led test on him in two weeks, to make sure the balls didn't have led in them. We would also have to monitor him to make sure they passed....I would not recomend this product for any child..."
1,This toy killed Baenoo!,"I got this along with the bongos for my 2 year old daughter, Baenoo, and she cracked the maracas in 2 minutes, spewing little metal balls everywhere! She then put them in her mouth and suffacated to death! Now I take the blame upon myself, i bought her this horrible toy and now she is dead!"
3,Love the artists and the humor,"I ordered this CD because we love the artists,(especially Bobby Bare) and the songs were very humorous, but there is a lot lacking in the quality. This CD apparently was recorded live and the music in places was entirely covered up by the cheering and noises from the live audience. It really took away a lot from the enjoyment of the music."
4,Sorry it misses some songs,"I bought the cassette version of this album over a year ago and would rate it 5 stars all the way. I recently bought what I thought was the CD version of the same album and was highly diappointed to find some of my favorite songs missing. The songs that are there are very good and enjoyable. Let's say four star. The songs that are missing were, to me, five star songs."
1,ouch,"All of these guys have way way way better stuff, not the least Shel Silverstein who wrote the songs. For hardcore complete-ist fans maybe, or my guess, old dogs themselves who remember when."
3,This is my Dad's favorite music.,"Dad is 81 years old, and life has been difficult at times, but this CD brings out a belly laugh at times. We also enjoy it - and have given it to ""special friends"" as gifts."
3,Bait and switch warning! It's not like the ad on TV!,I bought this because of the cool infomercial that showed these guys playing acoustic guitars and singing the songs together.It's the same guys--but it's live concert recording with a full electric.Dissappointing.
5,That Old Dog'll still hunt!,"This is not for the Geezers! I am 30 years old, but these are the guys who were on the radio in my childhood in the mid and late 70's while I was hangin' around my grandfather's horse barn. I have spent the 20 years since my childhood looking for the country equivalent of an oldie's station. Thank God for the Old Dogs!This album is proof that Country Music's legends are LIVING legends, still buryin' bones, and will not have to wait to be dead to be spoken well of as one track here suggests.Every young country fan today who can not remember the ""Outlaws"" owes it to themselves to hear this music."
4,A MUST HAVE TWO CD SET FOR COUNTRY MUSIC FANS.,"The ""old dogs "" Waylon Jennings, Bobby Bare, Mel Tillis and Jerry Reed poke fun at the music business, old age, each other, and life in general It's easy to tell that these four old dogs had a ball making this album."
5,ITS A SHAME,"It is too bad when the Recording Companies Throws such LEGENDS out the back door to promote some of the weak voiced New (stares)? You cant tell if you are listning to Brian Wwite or Modana.What is wrong with whole picture? It is good to hear the Legends even if I have to buy there CD's to hear them. Some of the new stares do talent,but the Legends deserve to be heard..."
3,good ropes,Pretty decent product. very similar to what we grew up with on the school playground. Still waiting for spring to give it the real test. It's hard to jump rope in the snow
5,Was what i expected,Keep up the good work it's vendors like you that keep me comming back to amazon for all my shopping needs. Thanks!
4,Thumbs Up,"I found this book excellent to go back and brush up on fundlementals, and certainly filled in some missing gaps in my knowledge. I would think this would be a good book for someone new to VBA also."
2,A display of modern weaponry with no insights on the actual event...,Offers no insight on the iraqui side as to what actually went on during and after the operation. No information about iraqui casualties or how Saddam's regime was affected. No information about the targets struck. Interviews to fighters and leaders on the iraqui side would have helped. It is just propaganda on how incredible the weapons are and the damage they could inflict.
3,Cute...,"a little small, and a little short - but very cute! And, of course, great for the die-hard fan that I am!!!"
3,Ancient and obsolete,"Not unless you work on dinosaurs would you want to read this book. If I had the ability to return the book, I would have. It was a waste of money. It's true that to understand how computers work it's important to know their developments, but Minasi's tome keeps getting thicker and thicker with each edition; he covers the modern technologies, and does not remove the outdated references to hardware like the ST506 interface. Usually you would find those cards as door stops or as boat anchors.Minasi rambles on and on. His coverage is very much in depth, yet it is not written in a style for a book of a technical nature.I would not recommend the book for its coverage of current systems; if you cover old ancient systems, it makes a fair reference, though."
5,Fantastico!,I was thrilled and pleased about the quick mailing service. The book was just like brand new and I love having this book in my collection. Gracias! Thanks!
1,anyones guess at what you are getting / bad product information,"can anyone tell me what aspect ratio this might be ????? is it one episode or up to 55 episodes ??? CAN THIS DESCRIPTION OF THIS DVD BE ANY MORE VAGE THAN IT ALREADY IS. using this description is like buying a box marked TV inside, then you find out its a box of rocks. to the person who wrote product info, IT'S ALL ON THE COVER / OR BACK SIDE OF THE PRODUCTTurns out this is a 45 min. one story edition, had they been up front with this info, I would not have bought. This is FROM the series, not the complete series This is MISSREPINTATION at its finest, or lack of. If you like this kind of cartoon, wait for the whloe series, price will probaly be about the same as this one edition.Cartoon is also not that bad to watch, would have been better if this had been the whole series"
1,DISAPPOINTED IN THE DEPTH,"I LOVE SWISS DIAMOND PRODUCTS, BUT THIS FRY PAN WAS TOO SHALLOW, SO I RETURNED IT AND NOW HAVE A WIDER AND DEEPER SWISS DIAMOND FRY PAN."
3,swiss diamond,"i think we need a clarification from the manufacturer, is it teflon or not?Swiss Diamond Cast-Aluminum Nonstick 8-Inch Fry Pan"
1,Disappointed,I recieved this item in a timley manner.. I found that I believe that I have been shipped a used or returned item.. Unlike the other pan I recieved this one had obviously been opened and had the attaching parts for the handle opened with pieces missing.I am very disappointed as they clearly state that returned items would not be accepted if opened..
1,Read the fine print - then walk away,"READ THE WARRANTEE at [...] - for obvious reasons, you won't find it in any of their advertising or hang tags. THE WARRANTEE IS VOID IF YOU COOK OVER HIGH HEAT. In black and white the warrantee states you can only use this pan over medium or low heat (they state high heat is unnecessary when cooking with diamonds . . .BS!). In other words, this pan cannot be used for braising, searing, or any other of a million things a fry pan is meant to do. After 6 months of normal household use on a standard gas range, the pan started sticking to the point that it was virtually impossible to fry an egg even with a generous coating of butter or oil. I took the pan back to the cooking store and they told me the pan had ""obviously"" been used over a high flame and wouldn't replace it under warrantee."
4,My new frying pan,"This sounded like the answer to all fry pans and I would never have to buy another for a LONG time. Well, it's a good pan, but it is much more shallow than most fry pans and therefore you have alot more splatter when you use it. It really does not work for frying chicken, for instance, because you can't pour in enough oil to do a good job. It does have an excellent non-stick finish."
4,"Excellent pan, weak lid","I've been using my Swiss Diamond covered frying pan for about 5 months, loving every experience. Today I decided to finally test it out in the oven with a casserole. I had the oven on at 350 (the box says the pan's oven safe up to 500), but within 15 minutes the glass lid shattered. The glass is tempered, and I've baked with other glass lids before without incident, so I thought nothing of using this glass lid in the oven. The lid is not under warranty, so I have to spend $30 + shipping. If the lid isn't oven safe, it should be stated on the box, the owners manual, and stores' product description."
5,A Little Small,"I guess I should have used a ruler to see exactly the size of this brush. It is on the small side, but does work well when I get my hair cut and it's shorter. It is good quality as all Spornette brushes are. Other than being small, I am very pleased with this brush."
2,Too small for an adult head,"I was looking for a round thin brush for travel. Unfortunately, this is not it.It is much too small and cumbersome to use on the average head of hair. It would workgreat on a doll, just not on an adult head. A positive is that it has high quality bristles."
5,My favorite book,"I have to say that this is my favorite book. I have read it again and again. And I am getting ready to start reading it yet another time. The history behind the story is what draws me in, especially due to the fact that my own father lived through the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and recounts many of Mortman's stories as his own. The Wild Rose is a fantastic historical novel that is well worth the read."
1,Poor fit & finish,"This replacement cutter head had a gap between the foil and the plastic head that tended to trap and pull whiskers. It did not seems to be of the quality that I expect from Braun, and was expansive considering the cost of the razor. It did not seem to fit the razor well and had a different sound in operation. I don't know if it was coincidence, but only a few weeks after buying it, the razor began to jam and eventually failed. That was only the second (Braun) rechargeable razor that I had bought in 30 years of shaving.I replaced it with another Braun razor, but now that one is having problems also, so my opinion of Braun is slightly dented."
5,Braun razor parts,"Prompt original shipment,but when I returned the items because I had ordered the wrong thing the company was very unresponsive and rude I do not recommend this company (Discount Central on line) My replacement razor heads arrived today finally-one reason for the long delay was the company did not let me know I would owe more money for the replacement items until I tried to trace the order several times."
5,Lifespice,This is a delightful collection of recipes spiced with the author's personal memories which mixes to make an unbeatable combination. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and particularly love the recipes for beef stew and cornbread sticks. This book is a keepsake which I know I will use over and over. This is an author that bears watching--she is obviously going places! I highly recommend this book to everyone.
4,A good read,"I read all 3 books in the Calling Crow series, I really enjoyed the story and found it hard to put my Kindle down until I was done. The Kindle version price is a great value, but there is little or no navigation available. I would have liked to see a preface or an ""About the Author"" section in the book. What is Paul Clayton's background, or expertise on the history of Native Peoples prior to European contact? Did the story of Calling Crow stem from actual historical events? As an avid reader of historical fiction it is of interest to me to know this information. The books are a good read but I did get hung up on the spelling and grammatical errors throughout all three. This was a disservice to Mr. Clayton's writing by the publisher, perhaps there were just problems in converting the script to the electronic format, in any case the errors are distracting and take away from the great story it is. I do however look forward to future books from this author."
5,Heart wrenching,"Portrays the wonder of the unknown and the wretchedness of betrayal by greed and powerlust. It's the history of man that should not be forgotten, but learned from."
3,Good,I kept hoping the story would get better. Seemed to drag a bit. I usually like historical fiction especially american indigenous stories.
2,Not What I Expected,"I love Duke. I have seen him live and I love many things I have seen him do. This DVD was a disappointment. I expected the Blues and got a lot of Jazz tunes. Duke is great Blues player but not much of a Jazz player so if you want to see the Duke do what he does so well, look elsewhere."
1,Duke Robillard: Live at the Blackstone River Theatre,I saw this guy on a video on UTube and he sounded good. I was disappointed in the quality of his performance on this DVD. I will probably never watch it again.
2,This is not for a Treo 680,"THis product is thinner than the one I am replacing, and it is not for a Treo 680. The slot for the Card opening is for a MicroSD card & does not allow removal of the SD card on a DS card. :("
4,Great for $3,"Fits well on my 755p. Just the right thickness. Better feel than other products. The silicone is ""grippy"" which keeps the phone from falling out of the cargo pocket on my scrub pants when I squat down (used to happen at least once a day). Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that I wish it covered the keyboard and had printed keys. Unfortunately no one seems to make one like that for the 755 yet."
4,Mineralogy Textbook,The textbook arrived about one week after I ordered it - well before I actually needed to use it for class. It has become a good resource for identifying minerals.
4,works for what I need,"I got this book used because I needed it cheap, and that's how it was. Corners are a bit worn, and the accompanying CD is missing, but it works fine for what I need."
5,Great Service,Thank you so much to this seller! I am a student and buying books is very expensive. A great price and it arrived in good time. No writing in it and the CD came inside. Will buy from this seller again if I have the opportunity.
4,Manual of Mineral Science (23rd ed.) Top in Field!,This new edition has made several improvements over the last one. The organization is clearer and better prepared. This book provides a better explanation and more detailed examples than other books of this type. The CD is a great asset for readers in comprehending the heirarchy of crystal organization and provides better visualization of the three-dimensional aspects of the various crystal forms and structures.
3,Not for the light of heart.,"This is a great book for those who want a very in depth and comprehensive understanding of mineralogy. However, with no prior knowledge in chemistry or geology this book is very hard to understand. It is also very hard to read. It does not flow and is very analytical. It does have so very useful things though. It has a description and breakdown of most minerals and a great mineral index. If your serious and have prior background, get it."
2,Did not care for it,"I know of no one in my class who was thrilled with this book. Many found it hard to understand and a dull read (it's black and white save for a few pages). My problem wasn't as much with that as it was the fact that I prefer a textbook that actually has review questions. This is the only one I have ever had that had none. It would have been nice to have had some stereographic projection and phase diagram problems just to name a few. I often found myself searching online for additional information, examples, or to just get more clarification in plainer English of a concept. I will probably resell this book and possibly buy another to keep."
4,Good Information at your Fingertips!!,Love this CheatSheet!! It has great info at your fingertips!! All the important info is right therefor you to find quickly and easily. I am enjoying this very much --- no more thumbing throughthe book to look up things. This really helps if you need info in a hurry!!
1,Dont listen to him this gun sucks,The guy who says the bad reviews are stupid is stupid. His gun is probably broken right now. It sucks and so does he. I was careful with my gun and now its in 8 peices. This gun doesnt even hurt unless ur a wuss who crys to much. the aim is afawl and the led laser light broke in a matter of days. if you think this gun is automatic then ur wrong. you have to pump every time you shoot and its not easy. if you want a real gun get the UTG Sawed off Shotgun that is the best one. SO DONT BE THE IDOIT WHO LISTENS TO THE GUY THAT GIVES THIS JUNK 5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Crap,"this thing is a piece of crap dont wasted your time on this gun. I rate it 0000000000. If you want to buy this gun just buy a Nerf gun. you have to pull it back with every single bullet. All this piece of crap is, is a Nerf gun that shots BB's. Please do not waste your money. I waited a whole week for this and i open it up and it looks amazing you will think it is to until you try shooting it. I spent all my Birthday money on this air soft gun or Nerf gun.This gun SUCKS!!!!!."
2,okay gun,okay first of all my parents bought 4 of these guns for everyone in the family but all of them broke exept for mine.these gun shoots hard and pretty acurate except the laser sight isnt very accurate this is a good bigginer rifle but a piece of junk as far as qualitie goes.
1,i wish there was a 0 star rating,"this is the most cheap gun i have ever gotten. The gun is labeled new but it looks as it has been used. the flashlight wont go on and the lazer doesn't work the grip sucks and over all it was made in china. good air soft guns are made in Taiwan. please do yourself a favor and dont buy this i got it for christmas and im returning it and getting an aeg peace. Also before you buy from this company, make sure that you understand that if you return their products for a refund, they will take money for restocking, and also for shipping, so you will end getting only about half of the money you spent."
1,"Terrible gun, cool accessories",I found that the gun was terrible. Very painted on plastic-y and just a waist. WELL wasnt the company I wanted. I highly recommend Double Eagle. This gun sucks
3,It's kind of powerful but...,"This is a pretty good gun, it's pretty powerful and it hurts when you get hit which is good, the laser is really powerful and it shines pretty far I was surprised how powerful it is.The light that comes with it isn't that powerful and there's no reason to use it. The tactical handle is kind of jiggly and feels like it's gonna fall off. It says that it has a full auto but that's not true, the only way that you can shoot it is if you pull back the bolt or what ever it's called. After about a week or two the bolt broke on mine(what makes it shoot) and now I can't fire it. Over all I rate it at 3 stars."
1,THE GUN IS NOT GOOD,"This is a crap gun. The rail system keeps falling down, the laser is not acurate,the gun is not acurrate,it is made of cheap plastic,the flashlight is hard to put on the gun,the guns spring gets weakend very easily,the auto and semi dont do anything.Dont buy this gun!"
2,False advertising?,"I got this gun, and I had assumed it was an electric/gas powered rifle, because in the photo, it clearly shows 3 fire modes: safe, semi, and auto. Since NOWHERE on this page does it say if it's spring/gas/electric, I got it, but it turns out to be a SPRING powered gun.In addition to this, upon loading the magazine, I had to violently ram it in with my fist, because it refused to stay in place. Then, I had to violently pull it back out, because the button takes about 20 presses to get it to release properly. I looked inside beforehand, and noticed that the holder was bent for the magazine. After I pulled the magazine back out, a piece of it chipped right off.I then noticed that the laser sight was not in the package as advertised. Huge disappointment.All in all, please, get a different gun. This is not worth the risk."
3,is this spring or electric,can someone please tell me if this is a spring gun or a electric gun because I though that It was electric when I bought it but then i keep hearing that it is spring in all of the reviews... some one help me
3,Kinda dissapointed,Within a week the red dot laser stopped working and the auto fire on the gun is non existent which I should have expected. Went through a poster and a stuck in cardboard behind it.
1,WORST GUN EVER!! It didn't even SHOOT!?!?,I got this gun I was pumped and excited and I got it pulled the lever back any ways it said it was electric and shot and didn't shoot ANy idea what happened or what I did to it?
2,wrong listing,the damn thing was listed under electric guns on my browser so it gets here in two day .. the company is good and i have had good luck with hit guns before ... but the fact that i dropped that much cash on a spring rifle makes me feel stupid ...
3,airsoft gun,"Very cool looking rifle, but the ""laser"" sight not too great. The power line broke to the laser in 1 day. My son was very disappointed."
2,cheap,"this gun is very difficult. when i got it, i was mad because my brother was expecting an awesome gun, and he saw that it was a cheap piece of plastic. it didn't come with everything it was supposed to.it is very hard to reload. on it, it says it can shoot semi-automatic, or automatic. it doesn't it only shoots by pulling a cocker every time. it gets anoying. it is extremely hard to reload, and it takes forever.its sickens me. the safety goggles are junk"
5,This is a MUST HAVE gun,this gun is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i bought it cause of all the reviews it had and i needed a long lasting gun.
1,worthless POS,This is a worthless toy. The ad says its made of steel and electric but when we got the guns they are just plastic and they are NOT electric. They are spring and you have to cock it for every single BB. My kids wont even play with them. That was a waste of Christmas money. I do not recommend these guns! We got ripped off!
3,"Even thought some stuff didn't come with it, it was alright","The laser was not in the boxThe 100 bb's were all over the box, out of its packageIt was a mess"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I don't know how I didn't find the rest of the reviews, I swear there were only 5 or 6, not 200+ when I ordered. Once I got this product for my son, the red flags went off. The package, from China. The writing, in chinese. The english translations, not properly translated. The gun arrived with no laser. The gun is not a semi-auto, nor is it an auto, even though it has a moving switch for those. It has single spring loaded rail that holds about 5 or 6 bb's. You can put the rest of the bbs in the magazine, but it's just for storage. You have to pull a tab each time you want to fire. When your spring is empty, you have to pull the magazine out, shake it, and pray you get more bb's in the rail. It is that bad. It is a beginner gun alright, if you are a 5 year old.Not worth packaging for a refund or even talking with the person that actually sells this garbage. There. I'm moving on, just a stupid tax on my part."
2,look elsewhere,"This was a Xmas present for my ten-year-old son. He loved the look for the device but the firing mechanism was junk. He has plenty of experience with AirSoft guns and this did not live up to his or my expectations. Save your money and look elsewhere. I had no problem with the seller, just the product."
5,AMAZING,"This is my son's first airsoft gun, and he LOVES IT. He wouldn't stop playing around with it. I recommend it for anyone."
5,Gun is really good.,"This gun is good. All the attachments are there and easy to build. Includes a strap & 50 BB's. The strap is although small and not for guys that are for 5 foot or bigger and it is easy to brake. With the laser, you need to adjust it by turning the knob at the end, so it can be zeroed, but it won't be zeroed for all distances so keep that in mind. The sight is small so if you want you could buy a sight and put it on, though I don't know if it will work."
5,great gun,"This gun is probaly one of the best spring begginer guns. It shoots around 300 fps with .20 bbs and it goes up to 125 ft. It does not have adjustable hop up but with .2 bbs it shoots very straight and accurate. I do not recomend using .12 bbs, they are horrible....it goes at most 50 ft and then goes straight up into the air. The fore grip is a little wiggly but that doesn't matter so much and if it realy bothers you, you could just put a screw into it. I've had this gun for about a year now and it still shoots great. Only 1 time it got clogged up and i just had to take it apart to fix it but it still worked great. The mag is prety anoying to load bbs but its not that bad wen you get used to it.....i recomend buying extra mags.Overall this gun is great and i have no complaints"
2,Do not buy,"This gun is pretty cool looking, and shoots pretty nice and accurate. But thats all, the gun's LED light broke on the 3rd day, the gun itself then broke on the 5th day of using it. The plastic is pretty good, but it is cheap. This gun is bad and thats all i have to say to it."
2,You get what you pay for.,"Im not really surprised at the quality of this gun considering its like 20 bucks. However, i did buy an $80 dollar gun. It still is mostly plastic but shoots alot harder, faster, and is way more reliable."
1,Its not auto,this gun is not auto did you see the reviews i wrote you wasted your money. YEAH THATS HOW MUCH THIS GUN SUCKS
5,what?,"I don't even know you, why the heck ae you calling me a jerk. Your the only person that needs to SHUT UP!!!No kid is going to talk s%&t to me. The only reason I put a kids review is cause I didn't feel like sign'n up on this amazon thing. I know a lot more than that kid will ever know!"
1,Hate this gun yo,This gun is the worst thing in the world. Ihad it for 3 days when the back fell off. ya it shoots fast and all but it breaks easilly. I was playing with my freinds with it when the trigger got stuck and everyone shot me wa wa. i cried like a baby. wa this is a suicide gun DO NOT BUY ITpeace out holla at ya boy DO NOT BUY IT IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!whats that smell? i smell the worst gun ever yo im saving you with this one man
2,I don't suggest this gun,"I bought the gun and it broke four days later, for no reason. The laser pointer was the best thing about the gun, but even that was off. The flashlight shined all of two inches. and the foregrip came loose on the third day. Also, I couldn't find any instructions for adjusting the hop-up, which, I think, was not included. The only reason this gun gets two stars instead of one is because the customer-service from netlink enerprises was great. I can't say the same for airsplat because I have never had to return anything to them. I suggest saving your money and getting a UHC gun. They are a little more expensive, but are great quality."
1,Not worth the money,"This Airsoft gun is not worth the money, I purchased two of them thinking they would be full or at least semi auto, they are not!Contents of Both Box'sBox 1 Box 2Rifle RifleLaser Different LaserNo BB's BB'sLight LightGlasses GlassesStrap StrapLaser:When the laser does work it is about 16 inches off targetLight: not worth anything not even for BS low light shooting ""Blue Light that barley works""This is not a good airsoft gun and does not resemble the AR-15 in more ways than one, my advice SAVE UP FOR A BETTER GUNSource: AR Owner"
2,? Questionable ?,"Hi, This gun is for new people only. This Gun's Cons are it doesnt come with a laser. Full Plastic. Extremely brakeable. Foregrip wont stay on. Shoots weakly. And is not accurate from more than 15 feet. Its Pro's are... Hmmm I cant think of any."
2,dont buy!,"this gun is not very good... i bought it as my first and it doesnt say in the description but this gun is spring and it sucks. the magazine is stuck when i opened it and when i put ammo in it, the gun would not shoot. it broke after that. so please do not buy! go get an electric airsoft gun if you are serious about airsoft. this gun is good though if used for like a prop or something."
4,cool gun,"This is a good gun. I like It. It seems their is an agument between the gun. I agree with the guy that gave it five stars. The other guy seems like he needs to shut up, plus he can't spell! Anyway, I'm going to keep this short and simple its a cool gun."
4,quit your whining,hey im 14 and ive been playing for 3 yrs and i dont care just how good of an airsoft expert is u all just need to shut the f$#c up because this is a review on the gun and if u like it or not or what happened to it when u got it. so just shut up because these reviews over yourselves doensn't help anyone trying to buy the gun. now that thats out of the i am gonna buy this gun tuesday and it is a very good gun because all my friends have it and i use theres they all got it from academy for the full price and sure it will mess up every once in a while but all spring guns do that it happens with all the spring guns and quit complaining because your not even paying full price like u would at an academy or somewhere like that and your getting the led light and a laser sight for about 30% off or so so just quit complaining about everthing and quit whining about it because u dont know evrything in the world about these guns
3,M16-A4,"the gun is quite good. The LED lights are blue just in case you were wondering and the lazer pointer and front grip work well. The only faults i could find in the gun were that it isnt really accurate but it is good for close quarters, and like the other review said the front grip does become loose over use"
3,HAHA,"I personally do not have this gun, but I wanted to say some things...I was reading some of the reviews, and here is some adviceFor you people that are disappointed that this is not an AEG, notice how it says SPRING rifleTo the guy that was complaining about the location of the cocking mechanism, that is where it is on the real gun.To the people that throw it across the room or drop it off a roof and wonder why its broken, good luck getting a job.I also doubt that a real M16 has a range of 25 feet,and lastly, to the two kids that were arguing(and yes I know that was forever ago), arguing about it does not change the guns specs. BTW, the guy that said he had a 4.00 in school, thats 4.0 GPA, and I highly doubt that when you spelled life, live.Have Fun"
4,"Great Gun, Heres Why","I'm not an Airsoft expert, but this gun was great. It is not automatic, it's spring powered, but it is very powerful! It's great looking and nothing has broken yet. It is very hard to put the LED light and laser pointer on, plus you need batteries for the laser. The gun shoots very fast (look at main page for exact FPS) and is good looking and lasts long. Overall, I am very impressed with this gun, at an AMAZING price."
2,An actual review,"Well, I actually recieved this gun in an ordering mix up; I ordered the HFC M16-A4 and ended up with this. I had read the reviews on the HFC gun and everyone said it was really good, this one however... isn't so great. After firing the gun several times I found that the BBs went straight for about 15 yards, after that they would curve straight into the ground. When I turned the weapon upside down and fired, the BB went straight and then upwards. It seems that this gun has a ""Hop-Down"" system rather than a hop-up. Firing the .12 BB the accuracy is diminished to a unforgivable degree. Overall, the gun looks cool, is sturdy enough to survive normal conditions (it could be stronger though), has a decent clip, shoots fast, and is accurate up to about 25-30 feet. It is this lack of accuracy and the ""hop-down"" that drags the rating down to a two. If you want this gun, you should look into the HFC M16-A4(I am awaiting the arrival of mine). I returned this gun."
5,IDiot reviews READ BEFORE BAD REVIEWS!!!!,You guys are absolutaly dump. Well anybody that gave this gun a bad review because of it breaking. Obiously if you drop a huge delicate gun it will break! Stop blaming your stupidity on plastic. Things don't break themselfs.
1,Rip off,"I purchased this gun for my son for Christmas. I was hesitant because of the low price, but I have never had a bad buy on Amazon until now. We already own several air soft guns, and I must say this is the worst one. The $14 pistol we purchased from the bargain store far outshines this one as far as quality. It did not come with the laser sight as advertised. The led illuminator did not come with mounting hardware. Full auto does not work at all. Just basically a piece of junk."
2,dont buy,when i got it in the mail and opened it the red dot sight was not thereand after a few days the gun fell apart i would not advise anyone to buy the product
1,Missing a Part,"The gun is alright, it's made out of cheap, lightweight plastic. But it was missing the infrared laser. Very disappointing."
4,Great Gun Very Fun,I got this gun and it was amazing. Yes it's a spring airsoft gun but is still very powerfull and fun. However when I got it the laser wasn't there so that was a bit upsetting. All in all great gun great FPS and pretty good acurracy. Good gun for begginers and backyard airsoft battles.
2,Gun was cool but... :(,The gun works great . Didn't take long to get to my home . Shoots good looks good laser is pretty sweet works good BUT... The main reason I got this gun was for the blue tac light ...... Unfortunately it stoped working hmm I would say a day after I got it replaced the batteries thinking maybe they were cheap. Well it wasn't the batteries the thing just stoped working. So I'm not sure what to do ... Not to happy
3,ok gun,fps 300. good gun for beingers. laser broke the day I got it. if pro at airsoft do not buy. get a shotgun with 400 fps.
1,Disappointed,WARNING WARNING WARNING DON'T BUY WARNING WARNING WARNING This item is very junky!!! Spend the extra $10.00 and get a better one. Nothing works on this gun.
5,This is a pretty sick gun.,"This gun is pretty good.. For the low price, its worth it. I don't know why you think you won this argument, cause you didn't. Your the only one. You write multiple reviews to make yourself not look alone. And yes, you are still the nerd. I'm a really happy kid because i have a great life, so I don't no what your talking about. Bye you idiotic low-life."
2,airsoft freak's rewiew,This gun works okay at first but after a while the aim gets off and it doesn't shoot as fast. After a few months mine broke. it also takes longer to ship than the webpage says.
2,Another thumbs down.,"A friend of mine purchased this rifle and the gun broke after a week. He passed the gun onto me and I have to say, I can see why it broke.-Power- Poor, some of the worst I have seen in a rifle. You might expect this kind of power from a pistol, but on a rifle, it is just sad.-Looks- The M16-A4 doesn't look bad, but it's doesn't look great either. The black finish on the gun looks a bit cheap when you get close.-Design- The laser pointer and LED light do not fit very well on the RIS rail. Expect some frustrating moments when they fall off while your using it. The forgrip slowly becomes lose after time. This is a problem if you plan to have this gun for a while.-Verdict- I would reccomend the M16-A4 to someone who was planning on using it for a month or so, but if you really plan on using this for an extended period of time, then I dont reccomend it."
3,treat your gun with care,"alright ppl, i dont own this gun buttttt i have read a lot of reveiws stating there guns broke b/c they dropped them. well duhh what do u thinks gonna happen when u drop it. all im saying is treat the gun with care"
1,Are u Stupid,"Anyone that gives this gun five stars is out of their mind. Its a piece of junk and dont reveiw it if you dont have the gun. Im the guy that started the argument a year ago and now i see there are still losers talking about it. I was only fulling around cuz i was bored but u people make a big deal out of it. All i hear is wah wah blah blah, the gun sucks mine broke after a week and so did other kids. Buy a gas gun if you have its a lot of money, but WORKS!!!"
1,A total piece of junk,Do NOT buy this piece of junk. We bought it for our oldest son and it lasted all of 3 hours. He accidentally dropped 2 feet to the ground it broke.This product is made with an extremely cheap plastic. It has already broken in 3 places. I will be reporting this matter to the Better Business Bureau.
1,ITS brokEn,This gun came with broken parts the butt was broken the laser was broke it was crazy but it shots ok but save your seft the time and get anouth type not this 1 ok guys
1,Grow up you jerk,This gun is the best..............just kidding. i bought this gun because the guy who gave the gun 5 stars sounded right. but when i got the gun today it was cheap plastic.And it doesnt hurt bad at all. isaw these reviews and it seems that 2 guys are arguing about it. the guy who says this gun is good called another guy stupid and a brat. it seems to me that this guy has problems. and i agree with the guy who says this gun sucks but he shouldnt call names.so who ever calls this gun 5 stars needs to shut up cuz he is wrong.NoNoNoNoto this gun
1,this company rots,so i put my brand spankin new clip in my gun....i fire the gun a few times and then it starts to sound weird...so i continue to use my nice new gun thinking that the battery is dying....nope....the battery wasn't dying....the clip was a piece of junk....it destroyed my gun leaving me no option but to throw away my gun....wow.....isn't that a kick in the head for ya....wuts worse? i bought 2 of these stupid clips....u can bet i threw the other one away too....do not order from this company...you might get the same problem
3,Not a Review,Why are you people rating the gun and telling all the cons and pros if you do not own the damn gun. buy it. test it. review it.
1,This Kid needs to shut the hell up,Listen im just writing my opinion.Hey kid im sorry you get your fun out of insulting people. Everyone one out there this gun to me is the worst but not to the other kid and i respect that. Im not going to call names and be jerk like that kid is.I think this gun is horrible. At 290 fps yeah its a little strong but it gets jammed easily and ends up shooting horribley. After a while it becomes unfixible and is worthless.And the PLASTIC is extremely cheap your handle will come off or the back will who knows but i gurentee you something will come off.That kids gun is prbably in pieces to but he denies it HA HA. If you think this gun is auto then your wrong you have to cock it every time. A good gun would be the UTG CQB Sawed Off Combat shotgun it has a total of 5 stars not 3 like this one. But some kid gave it one star just to ruin its streak. That gun i purchased and its awsome for beginners and experts so dont get this peice of crap.[...]
1,ERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRr,I ordered this gun last week and its already in pieces. In just one battle it got jammed and then fell into pieces. Im so mad at that lady who said this gun is good cuz its not!!!I want a refund for this thing or i will yell.
4,It's okay I suppose,"I created a review so it's see able by everyone (on YouTube). I reviewed everything it comes with and how everything works!accuracy: 6/10Looks: 9/10Laser: 8/10Light: 8/10Foregrip: 5/10(It's a little wobbly)Stock: 7/10 (Adjustable)Movie Prop: 9/10M16-A4 Airsoft Rifle with LED illuminator, laser sight & adjustable gun stock Review.LINK TO REVIEW: [...]Short video I made with it: [...]"
2,Doesn't work,My son was very excited to get this on Christmas morning but yucky disappointed when it didn't work. The directions aren't in English so we aren't sure where we went wrong. We will be returning it :(
1,Not a good Christmas gift,"My son was excited about getting this airsoft gun. He was the one who picked it out. The gun didn't fire the pellets at all. Gun doesn't work. So I'm hoping the vendor gives me a full refund.UPDATE 12/29/12 Still waiting for my return auth to send this defective item back. This item was defective and you can hear rattling when it is moved. I want full refund incl seller paying for S&H; since item isn;t working nor will it work.UPDATE 1/4/13 Finally herd back from vendor to return this item. BEWARE do not buy from HOT IMPORT TOYS. If item is defective they may not refund you all your money and they make you return the item on your own dime. I will never, ever buy from this merchant again."
2,aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh,auto doesnt work not good buy listen to my helpful facts and pick a different gun to buy not this one
2,Not happy,"I am a single mom of 2 boys. I know nothing about air soft guns, assembly, how to modify and make better, etc. The spring inside needs to be adjusted or modified but not sure how to do it. My son is very frustrated that he cannot use the gun like he thought or had the understanding of when reading the description before purchasing. Overall, I'm disappointed with how the gun is designed. Maybe if I knew more about them my review could possibly be different but unlikely. I will be looking to purchase a better designed/assembled gun. I feel like I wasted my money on this one :("
2,Fell apart,Butt stock snapped off the first time we used it. Wbere you have to mount the laser sights makes tbem useless for targeting as they are several inches off. Very disappointed with the quality.
2,Seriously?,"This is not what I was expecting. I waited an extra 3 days for a gun that came with an awful packaging finish. The gun was covered in styrofoam in the little spaces and areas that made it hard to clean. The fore grip, stock, and magazine were loose, and not to mention there was no instructions anywhere about the gun. Once you finished loading your gun and put the mag. into the gun and cock it. It will feel as if the gun would break in your hand. I tried shooting and cocking back very carefully. Half the times the ammunition didn't even come out (.12 gram bbs that were supplied), and the ones that did skyrocketed up and swished every which way. This would be a great example of something you do not want. Unless you want to use it as a prop for a video, I do not recommend this gun for airsoft wars.Bad job Amazon."
1,I URGE CONSUMERS NOT TO PURCHASE THIS GUN!!,"As this gun fires surprisingly accurate, the plastic is very cheap and it was poorly made. This gun broke on the 3rd week I had it when my friend accidentally dropped it the barrel cracked almost all the way, but I figured I could fix it with some gorilla glue, it held for the night, but the next day my moronic friend John was running away from enemy fire and was looking behind him and ran right into the stock when my friend Kenny was trying to suppress fire.----PLEASE READ----THE POINT IS THE GUN IS POORLY MADE, THE WEAKEST POINT OF THE GUN IS THE MOST VAULNERABLE POINT I URGE YOU PLEASE KEEP LOOKING FOR A GUN THATS WORTH YOUR MONEY."
1,Hate this gun-Ha ha,everyone i want to tell you that the guy giving this gun 5 stars is crazy. he talks about my mom and he wont shut up. if you want a good gun get one where the comments are all 5 or 4 stars. im going to to be the man here and tell the kid whos talking trash to shut up and grow up. i am an expert with airsoft and paintball and i know this gun sux. the other guy is a hyper active loser who is very lonely . i would not purchase this gun if had the money to waste. 290 fps does not hurt unless your the other kid who complains about everything. dont listen to that fool and search this place for better onehey kid now what you goin do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Broken with in days of receiving,"If your considering this for your kid, I might search else where. Our was broken within days. Normally kids guns in our household will hold up for 6 months or so."
2,"When finally got it was excited,now disappointed.","when this product came in after a full week,i was excited. I heard the doorbell ring and knew it was it. I just got it a few hours ago and man did it look great. I though i got a great gun for a good price... I was wrong,very wrong.PROS:Looks nice all aroundNice adjustable stockGood feel and weightCONS:Flashlight doesnt workForegrip is wobblyLaser sight didnt work at first,then it did for 5minutes. Now doesnt work at all.When you fill your magazine it says it could hold up 475 bbs. Not really,it only hold up to only about 20-30 bbs.It has mistakenly set to semi,auto,and safe. The auto is actually the safe,and the safe and semi switches are just to fire.It is plastic.Summary:People say its good for beginners. I am a beginner but im the type who wants to be satisfied with this gun... You get what you'd pay for? Why sure if you like a piece of crap gun with attachments that dont do any good. The gun itself is good. The attachments are horrific."
4,dont use the lazer,this gun is perfect for back yard battles and is powerful enough to make your target retreatpower- 9/10range- 8/10looks- 10/10lazer- 1/10 (extreamly innaccurate)led illuminator- 9/10 (a little bulky)duribility- 8/10magazine- 10/10accuracy- 8/10stock- 11/10 (extra point because it is ajustable and removeable)foregrip- 7/10 (comes loose)
5,this gun is good,"when i got this gun i was amazed how well it worked. It is accurate you just have to have .20 gram bullets instead of the 6mm the grip does ware off from use, but nothin a little duct tape cant do. The LED lights work and the laser sight work. It is very powerful, i think it has strong plastic. Over all its a good begginer gun and its very realistic."
4,Great Gun,Good gun but shoots beter on semi. little off and i say it is around 200 fps. The M16-A4 is a awesome gun. Get it and have fun.
3,A lot for the $ but quality is lacking,"Overall this is a decent gun, but the build quality is lacking. Right off the case for the flashlight broke and a few days later the laser died and then 2 weeks into playing with it the gun stock broke off."
4,best gun,i bought this gun and i thought it look ok but then when i first puuled the triger i said omg this thing is beast it went right threw a soda can the laser sight is the thing i dont like but i get over it i recommand this gun for people that shoot around the backyard+
3,good customer service,i didnt like the gun. made very cheap but the customer service for the return was great! But in all i do not recommend buying this item.
4,Sometimes won't shoot.,"Great gun, Comes with lots of accessories, except that sometimes it won't shoot. When you open the clip some bullets will fall out, if it misfires."
1,Do NOT Purchase!!!! Save your Money!,"I purchased this gun for my teenage son and it was ridiculous how fragile it is. After only 3 days of having it, he set it on the counter, it slipped and fell, and SNAPPED IN HALF!!! From the second he got it stuff was breaking. If my teenager was the type of kid that broke everything I wouldn't have bothered to write this review, but he is usually great with all his things. This gun is not worth buying! The edges don't meet completely where they should, one of the hard sights was missing, and the thing barely stays together. The gun looks great when you get it, but it's a total disappointment."
1,JUNKK,"i recieved this product in 8 days, when i paid for 3-5 dAY SHIPPING, when i ogt it everything was in chinese, and the thing was small. then when i pulled it out and it was broken, and there was no laser. dont waste your money on this crap."
1,THE GUN SUCKS,"THIS gun is horrible i ordered it hoping it was going to be the best airsoft gun i ever gottn but u kno wat the day i recieved it, it was a disaster i was missing at least 2 attachments no infered launcher, and the flashlight broke and started to acttualy smoke it was ridiculos the grip fell to pieces the grip was broken the screws were in and it fell apart if your diciding to get this think again and just get the m16 a1 if u are even going to get one at all.M16-A4 Airsoft Rifle with LED illuminator, laser sight & adjustable gun stock"
4,Son loves it,"M16A4 Airsoft Rifle with LED illuminator, laser sight & adjustable gun stockGun is okay, has a few problems with misfiring but can live with it.Instructions are laughable at best, so assembly and operation are mostly a guessing game.But my son is happy after day one so there it is."
5,"cool features, fast shipment, and awesome fps!",This product is pretty cool and comes with a lot of different features. The rate of fire is only single shot but very high fps for a non electric gun. The adjustable stock is pretty cool as well as the forward grip. The only issues is that of course the gun is plastic and with care the gun will last a long time. Also the laser is pretty cool but not very useful if playing during the day since not very bright and doesn't show up well in the daylight. Overall gun is worth twenty bucks and can be reliable if used correctly. Would recommend to others if looking for a cheap gun to play in the backyard. Though if you are looking to play at bigger places and field then recommend getting a full metal gun and a little bit better quality trust me will be a little bit more pricey than twenty bucks but well worth it if you become a intense airsoft player.
2,you get what you pay for,"Don't expect a high quality piece of equipment. The butt of the gun fell off on the first day of use. In our case, my son only really wanted it for a movie prop, so playing with it was just a result of holiday company, and glue will repair it for his purposes."
1,Misleading search results and description,"I really don't know how good of an airsoft weapon this is because it won't be coming out of the box. I did a search on Amazon for an electric fully auto riffle and this was part of the search results. After receiving it today I found it to be a spring riffle which is absolutely NOT what I was looking or expecting. I went back to the ad to see if I had missed something and verified it with my daughter that there is nothing in the add indicating it to be a spring loaded or otherwise. If you're looking for a spring loaded this might be the gun for you if you're looking for an auto, move on. You'll be sorely disappointed."
4,Not too bad,I am simply returning this product because I would like to buy something with more power and I also thought it could shoot bbs but other than that its a petty nice gun
3,Two-thirds good,"The first two books in this three book compilation are really great and memorable works. They are an important part of the Darkover saga, and provide some interesting insights both to the Renunciates (Free Amazons), a separatist female group, and to the history of Terran/Darkover relations. However, I thought the last book in this trilogy absolutely lost any basis in reality. The motivations of the characters made absolutely no sense. The two main characters of the books are propelled on a quest that seems utterly pointless and ridiculous from the setup until the very end. Just stop reading after the second book and you'll be much happier."
2,not amazons again!,"an unfortunate side trip in the Darkover saga. MZB has created an amazing, detailed world in her books, but when writing about the Renunciates, or Free Amazons, the feminist tone gets entirely too shrill (and I'm female!). A good read for the world detail and background story to enhance the rest of her novels, but really requires patience to wade through the women-against-the-men rhetoric."
5,wow...,"Fantastic debut album from this Swedish outfit. Their sound owes a lot to Jesus & Mary Chain and dancey dream-pop, but they pull off a vibe that's entirely their own. The songs are varied enough, the melodies ultra-sweet without being sickeningly twee, the production not too dense or impenetrable. It floats, but doesn't disappear. 13 tracks, no bad songs."
2,Details well known places,"I felt the organization of this book left much to be desired. The table of contents is a full six pages long - and you need it. The book sometimes organizes locations by region, sometimes not.For a book that depends on the regions so much for it's organization, they are not well explained or mapped. There is a description of neighbourhoods about 40 pages into the book - but several neighborhoods (Ansley Park, Inman Park, etc.) are listed that are not included in the regional organization, so it is hard to determine which ones are important (at least for finding things in the book) and which ones are not.I also found the restaurant section to be lacking in both the amount of text allocated to each restaurant as well as missing a huge host of good restaurants. Fodor's Cityguide Atlanta is head and shoulders above this book in that respect."
5,The best book in a phenomenal series,"While each of the 11 Wildcards books I've finished reading thus far would earn 4-stars in my opinion, thus making each one great, this one surpasses them all. Funny how, in a superhero story such as this, the most intriguing chapter should be one revolving around politics.This book just focuses on a great selection of the most memorable characters from the Wild Cards universe, and to this day, to me at least, screams to be a movie. The whole series reads out very cinematically, but this book in particular."
4,Perfect Gift for Your Parents,"I have been using different types of Braun Oral-B products for years and this 3D model is the toppest one. The plaque remover gives you a comfortabl feeling and a complete cleanning with little of your effort. This Chrismas Holidays I think about to send two of this units to my parents in California and let them to enjoy it. It is good time to buy it now becaue the price is a big cut, plus with Amzon's free shipping you will save a lot. It is a great deal!"
3,PRICE ISN'T WORTH MAINTANCE,THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A BARGAIN..PLUS A GREAT BRAND NAME..HAVE TO AGREE W/ PREVIOUS COMMENTS ABOUT BRUSH SIZE AND BRUSH LIMITATIONS..YOU'RE WEARING OUT BRUSHES FASTER THAN ANY OTHER BRUSH I'VE ENCOUNTERED ON OTHER TOOTHBRUSHES.THE BRUSH SIZE IS A MERE SPIT..(COULDN'T RESIST) IN THE GREAT OCEANS OF AMPLE SIZED ELECTRIC BRUSHES OUT THERE..I'D RECOMMEND A SONICARE 1ST AND AN ORAL B AS A BACKUP.
2,Not that Great,"The sound clips sounded alright. I really bought it because of Enter Sandman. I love metallica's version. The sound clip of this sounded very interesting and I thought it would be a great song for my wife and I to swing dance to since we love to swing dance to the classics as well as some upbeat modern songs. Needless to say, I was disappointed in this CD and wish I had not wasted my money. The songs are not that great."
2,"Too many ""More on this later"" comments, piques your curiousi","This is a poorly written book on a subject, Aretha Franklin, whose talent I greatly admire. The book doesn't do her justice as she has a great deal more class than the book would leave you thinking. Why include a street fight that she had as a child? We know more about the food she ate than important details that are glossed over, such as the men in her life and a certain diva that she didn't get along with at a White House appearance. Aretha seems to be defending herself from so many comments made about her mother and what others said about her in the press without giving us enough of her side of the story. Many instances are brought up about various people in her life without giving us enough information and leaving us dissatisfied. Will someone please write a definitive biography about this fascinating woman? This one doesn't add anything to our knowledge of her."
1,I'D GIVE IT ZERO STARS IF I COULD,"Aretha is full of it and full of herself. Growing up, I adored this woman musically. Sure, she wasn't the greatest role model -- PK with two kids by the time she was 16 -- hmm -- and wasn't a style or fashion paragon by any means -- can I get an amen? -- and no she didn't have the greatest morals or the greatest taste in men -- but boy, there was a time there when the lady could SING. But as we all know, that time was a couple generations ago. As many have long been saying, she has been coasting on her laurels for a long time. But this book -- STAY AWAY FROM IT ALL COSTS! If you really want it, it'll be in the clearance bins right after Christmas. This book is a total waste of time. She may be able to sing but she is not a nice person. She is petty. Not a very happy person. I'm praying for you, 'Ree."
3,Aretha loves food almost as much as she loves herself.,"Let me first state: I love Aretha. However, co-author David Ritz fails to curb the Queen's self-aggrandizement in this sometimes fascinating account, which is part self-promotion, part dining guide. While juicy, Franklin's comments about rival divas Gladys Knight, Cissy Houston, and Natalie Cole come off as unflattering and unworthy of her. Also, the book lacks detail about the men in Aretha's life (e.g., her stormy marriage to Ted White) as well as her children, who are given less ink than Aretha's favorite foods and grub spots throughout the country. Throughout these pages, Aretha seizes the opportunity both to give herself credit and to play the unsuspecting victim. While the title ""queen"" gives Aretha stature, it obviously doesn't buy her class."
1,Hoping for something better,I have a feeling that Ms. Franklin is unaware of just how her book has let so many of her fans down. Why write a book and not be prepared to tell it all. I wanted to like this book but just could'nt.
1,Wasted Money,"Aretha,Aretha,Aretha. I am so disapointed. I should have waited and borrowed your book from the library. I could have spent my hard earned money trying to purchase a copy of the hard to find and out of print, Otis William's book. I did not buy your book to read about your father. I 'm from Detroit, we agree he was a great preacher, but instead of wasting our time and money, you should have simply written a biography about him for those who want to read it. Better yet write a book about ""Your good old days in Detroit."
1,Faded Queen's Autobiography is Big Cop-Out!,"I don't know who the Queen of Soul is now -- how silly the appellation is anyway -- but it sure ain't Miss Aretha. Badly written, uninformative, little more than a few PR releases sort of strung together in some vaguely arranged fashion. She comes off very, very poorly; unhappy, mean, disillusioned, overinflated sense of her worth in the world.I am so mad I wasted money on this."
2,Bland and Unrevealing--very un-Aretha-esque,"If you have a general knowledge of Franklin's history you this book is wholly unnecessary because it sheds no new or itneresting light on her as a performer or human being.The writing style is tight and insular with little beyond generic descriptors. Its as though she can't fully recall experiences and gives up on the details. I don't mean gossip-y stuff I mean basic descriptive language beyond ""I felt this.."" or ""I felt that...""Franklin also reveals an unnecessarily catty side toward Gladys Knight, Cissy Houston and Natalie Cole, all undeniable talents in their own right. She also glosses over the recording process beyond a handful of albums and never discusses her pregancies or marriage with much depth.This was clearly an attempt to cash in on the R&B singer autobiography trend and her good name because it is strangely heartless and shallow. If one is not interested in being open and accessible what is the point?"
2,Hard to Respect A Book This Slight,The Queen of Soul turns out not to be the Queen of books -- this seems like a blown opportunity. Hard to respect -- or care much -- about a book this slight.
3,"a breezy, superficial read from a soul superstar","I was completely blown away by Ms. Franklin's rendition of Puccini at the Grammys a few years back, and was curious to understand the story of this diverse singer, about whom I knew very little. After reading this book (in an afternoon), I feel as though I learned more about the modern history of Gospel and Soul music, which was great, but I was disappointed by the superficiality of the writing. I often felt like I was reading an extended press bio, which was nice, but not really what I was looking for.If you're looking for a serious, in-depth profile of a mega-star, I doubt this is the book for you."
3,Disappointment from The Diva,"First, absence of a discography and even index is astouding for a major title from a major publisher. Second, Miss Franklin's reputation in the entertainment business is of a rather distanced person who tends not to think or speak in a straightline. This kind of oblique personality doesn't translate to the printed page. There's little sense here of real life. Third, the ego displayed in these pages is truly disturbing. Miss Franklin seems long ago to have lost touch with any reality. She is a great artist and a seminal figure in music history but she is still a human. Someone needs to remind her."
1,Aretha: These roots need a re-touch.,"I did not like this book. I regret spending one penny on it. I started reading it under the dryer at the beauty shop. It was so boring that I put it down. I hate to waste money so I forced myself to read it. (It took about a month.)Although she gives some lovely historcal accounts of the 60's & 70's, I bought this book to hear her ""dish out the dirt"" and ""give me the 411"". On too many occasions, Aretha leaves the reader hanging by refusing to name names. The book read more like a page from her diary than an autobiograhpy of a singer. I was especially let down near the closing of the book, the words to her sisters. She should have just written them a letter rather than waste print. I bought this book to learn more about Aretha. From reading this book, I gathered that Aretha is a man crazy singer who loves to eat and is afraid to fly."
1,Why an Autobiography,"I was truly disappointed in this autobiography! The book was poorly written and recounted many petty incidents that seemed to have absolutely no significance. Also, I got very, very tired of Aretha remembering almost every morsel of food that's ever entered her mouth! Who told Aretha she should write an autobiography! If she has trouble discussing the private details of her life and she's a private person, why on earth would you choose to write an autobiography?"
1,The Queen of Soul is full of herself.,"Son of a preacher man and popping babies at 14. Drops out of high school. Yes, glosses over that by saying ""Babies are gifts from God.""Marries a man who makes Ike Turner look like Ghandi. And basically says nothing about this whole period. And ironically, it was during this same period with Ted White that she became the Queen of Soul and recorded the very career-making and legend-making material that has allowed her to coast with the title ever since.Has feuds with everyone from Natalie Cole to Mavis Staples. Not a nice person. Not a truthful person. She's becoming the music world's version of Norma Desmond. In Plus-Plus-Plus Sizes.A total disappoinment. Maybe someone else will tell her story one day."
3,"Starts to tell, then stops","This book is a tease. With few exceptions, just as the Queen of Soul gets close to giving some dish, she pulls back. It seems like she has feuds with many stars, but she doesn't give the complete story. I was very disappointed."
1,NO DETAIL,"This book could have been a great book if Aretha didn't keep jumping around the detail. With all the people she met she could have really included some wonderful pictures in this book. It was unfortunately rather boring, since she didn't want to mention names or any detail about her personal life. Aretha kept mentioning that she didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings, well, she shouldn't have bother to write."
1,No respect for this book!,"I LOVE Aretha Franklin. When you think of soul music, if you don't think of her, you'd have to be crazy. I was hoping that this book would give us insight into a career that has spanned the last four decades but I was totally disappointed. The entire book is spotty at best. It is poorly written with too much hidden from the readers and has to be one of the worst autobiographies I've ever read. You would think a life as interesting as the ""Queen of Soul"" would be enough to fill two volumes but if this is it, I think we better stick to her singing. Forget this lemon, console yourself with one of her cds---you're guaranteed to like that!"
3,"Chain, Chain, Chain of deceit!","I love Aretha so much, but after reading this book, I must admit the three stars I gave were out of a mixture of pity and favoritism. I don't know what she was thinking with that outfit on the Grammys and I don't know what she intended to gain by writing this confusing, dishonest, and unrevealing book!Her feuds with other performers, with the exception of maybe Luther, all point the finger at her as the culprit. She is less than kind to members in her own family. She is disillusioned that she created every musical trend and worse, was the trendsetter of clothing fashions (what a joke). And does she really have children? who would know? she rarely made any mention of them in relation to her rigors of parenting.I really hope that she comes to terms with her demons and gains back the respect of the many, very disappointing purchasers of this book. Thank God for libraries!"
2,Don't Buy It if you Want to Play Music You Bought from iTune,"Having just bought one of these units, I was aware that it said, ""Will not play Protected AAC music."" Being relatively new to iTunes, I did not realize that that meant, ""All music bought from the Apple Music Store."" So, I've bought probably 100 songs through iTunes, and I cannot play a single one on this unit.Do NOT be fooled by the ""Runs through iTunes"" thinking that this will play all of those songs you bought from them. Thought you owned those songs? Wrong! You don't. Apple still does. They decide when you get to play them, not you.My advice: Buy a Linksys or Netgear unit, as I'm about to do. This one is going back to the store where I bought it."
1,Three In A Row Broken,I really love this device when it works. Unfortunately I've had to return three of them after between one and six months because of hardware failures. They just don't seem to be designed and fabricated very well!
2,Could have been great . . .,"Unfortunately the warantee and the life expectancy appear to be about a month apart. There is no repair - just throw it away and get another - per Roku customer service. Mine had a ""hardware failure"" at the 13 month point so I'll be trying an alternative product. On the positive side, if you have a compatible wireless router and don't mind restarting it once a month or so (not really a big deal since a recent software release) it was fine. Not the device for the audiophile but not bad. Look around on the Roku support forum before you buy."
1,bluestar,Well I read the reviews and bought one of these. I had high hopes. Mostly what I bought it for was to add my favorute streaming internet radio stations and listen thru my stereo. I was very disappointed that the only ones I could get to work were thru I tunes. I called customer service and at first they were eager to help me. They were supposed to call me back but never did. So I phoned them. They could not figure out a way to help put in my preset radio stations. The last conversation I had with a so-called tech is that I get back with you shortly. I had a feeling deep down it was the last time I would hear from them. I was right. I was honestly not a pain either. As for as I am concerned I will never buy another item from this company because of their poor customer service. Save your hard earned money.
1,You're kidding me right?,"This book reads like a bad W.E.B Griffin/Harlequin romance all wrapped in one cheesy package. Less than two chapters about aerial combat and the characters giving parts of their anatomy cute little nicknames, give me a break. I hope this book isn't a veiled comparison to his own career, because it pales in comparison to other great Vietnam War era books like Bury Us Upside Down..., Palace Cobra, Tempered Steel, The Right Stuff for Fighter Pilots et al...General Fogelman was doing a friend a favor when he wrote a favorable review. This book was garbage...Mary Clare, Mary Clare...?"
5,Wonderful resource,Our Adult Education Class at church has been reading this book and we have found it to be very insightful.
5,"Excellent book! Christian-based, clear and informative!","This is an excellent book for anyone who is interested in learning more about how your personality influences how one prefers to study and learn about Biblically-based principles. There is no one correct way to learn. Some prefer in-depth individual study, some enjoy a good, fact-based sermon, some prefer group study--it doesn't matter, as long as one learns. I recommend any book that is written by the Littauer family."
1,"Same old book, retitled!","Except for the cover and title page: This book is identical to Rose, ""The Future of the Brain"" -- chapter by chapter, page by page, line by line, word by word, even typo by typo. When I was at UCLA, such a double publication by a faculty member led to demotion, and serious thought about breaking the tenure rule in order to fire the miscreant. Bye-bye Steven Rose!"
5,Made for TV... But worth watching,"Although made for cable television, I found this movie well written, superbly acted, and very enticing. A love story that spans several decades, the video does a good job of using flashbacks to tell the story and grab your attention; and then never lets it go. It proves that even under the most horrific of conditions, love can survive! And also reminds you that some times knowing the truth doesn't mean you have to tell the whole world the truth!"
3,Dvd,Don't know I bought it for a friend and I have not watched it myself. She has enjoyed the DVD though
5,Awesome case.,I bought this case for my dad for Christmas and he loves it. This is by far one of the best cases I've purchased. It's a must buy. 5 stars.
4,Blind Boys Rock!!!,Excellent 3 CD compilation of their music. Would recommend for anyone that likes gospel with an occasional rock beat.
2,Applegator43,It is a good healthy cookbook but not something I would have originally ordered it having looked through it at first. I will give it as a gift since I bought it. I cook a lot for myself and more plainly and simplier that what is shown here.
1,Braun 6520 Disappoints,"Purchased in December, 2000, I looked forward to another superior Braun shaver product. This one inadvertantly turned on during a trip rendered re-chargeable battery unchargeable. After one year, I have to replace the shaver. Could travel 50 miles to the authorized Braun dealer but not inclined to do so."
3,Go with a rotary razor instead.,"My first foray into the electric razor world. Had I to do it again, I would go with one of the rotary brands (with the circular razor heads) rather than with a foil razor like this one. The reason is that to achieve best effects with these, you need to shave EXACTLY against the grain. This is hard to do under the neck and around the chin, where the hairs don't grow all in the same direction. The result is that you have to make several passes over the same area at different angles, which worsens razor burn. The rotary shavers get around this by cutting in all directions at once. In short, if you're contemplating a new razor, go with a rotary. You'll thank me."
4,"Not as close as a blade, but great shaver","First, I really appreciate all the helpful reviews here that recommended taking the step up to the 6000 series for just a bit more money. This is really a nice shaver. Shaves quickly, the charge lasts forever, easy to clean, and so easy on the face that I never dread shaving anymore. Is it as close as a blade? No, definitely not. I'm not even sure it is as close as my old rotary, but I know that my face definitely prefers it to the blade or the rotary, and the shaver is so good I really don't mind doing a touch-up shave if I have to go back out in the evening."
3,Could be better,"When the rechargeable battery goes (after a year or two)it becomes a cord model. I can't find anyplace selling replacement batteries--it doesn't even look like it's possible to even open it up to see what this mysterious, short-lived battery looks like. I guess it's just planned obsolesence, just go buy another one for ..."
2,Great shaver - if it works,"The 6520 actually shaves closer than the new self cleaning shaver the 7680. However I have had reliability problems with both of them. My 7680 stopped recharging after a month or so, so I bought a 6520 instead. I have now had an incredible three in a row of these all stop recharging after a month or so. I have spoken to Braun who refuse to do anything other than have them repaired under their warranty programme....It is a great product, if it works."
5,Still working after 12 years,"I know it is pretty useless to review a product that hasn't been sold in 10 years. But I came across this while looking for the foil/cutter replacement pack-->Braun Series 3 Combi 31s Foil And Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 5000/6000).I used the shaver daily until I got a newer Braun model in 2004. Since then I use it when traveling, which can be many weeks during the year. It has survived the abuse of travel, and by occasionally replacing the cutter and foil, it seem to cut as well or better than new. The only problem is that the batteries don't hold a charge as they used to. But I keep the charging cord handy, which doesn't take much room as it is a simple coiled cord). There are some videos on YouTube describing how to replace the batteries, but I think I will just use it as a corded shaver until the motor dies."
5,Great for incentive,My child was very eager every night to review his responsabilities. When he realized he hadn't done something he would run to do it so he would get a reward. It's a great product. The only thing I would add is an attached pouch or something to hold the magnets to the board as my 18 month old will do anything to grab them and they are a chocking hazard for him. If I place the chart even higher then my 4 year old can't see his responsabilities and he gets discouraged. It is still the best chart out there.
3,Heavy Chart,This is a good product; however it is heavy and we are having a hard time figuring out where to hang it. The magnetic front bowed after a week and we had to get a new product. It seems to be fine now.
5,Love It!,"Bought this for my 3 year old grandaughter. She can't wait to get up every day, accomplish her ""chores"" and get a smiley. Her mom has determined an adequate number for her to shoot for and on Sunday, she gets to chose a reward for all her efforts. Each week they change up the goals and she start anew. It's adorable hanging at her viewing height in the kitchen and extemely well constructed. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to start their child working on behavior and household chores."
3,Happy with the product,"Happy to have it and is working well, but didn't notice it was damaged in shipping until after we had opened it. Always check for damage first!"
4,Years of incentive lie ahead!,"My 3yo and I both look forward to moving magnets on his board. Most days he asks what he can do to get more. My only product complaint is that the magnets are not terribly strong, so you have to make sure they are ON the board before you let go. I hope there will someday be an option for multiple kids on one chart.Having a category for ""Stop Whining"" is what sold this for me!"
4,"good, but...","I knew what I was getting, and it is exactly as expected and good quality, too.However, the design is an issue for me. The second whiteboard dangling from the top magnet board is very awkward for me. We can't hang it on the fridge because of the excess swinging. I'd rather have a little storage baggie or box to hold the smileys instead of this weird second board. I'll probably cut it off and use it separately.The top chore board is perfect! In addition to real chores (like feeding pets and doing homework) you can choose chores that your kids already do anyway to build in success right off the bat. Things like brushing teeth, getting ready for bed, etc. The size of the pieces is good, too."
3,Just Okay!,"The board is very well made. But, will probably be better suited for an older child - say 4 and over. My son is 3 and is only interested in playing with the magnets and no interest in filling in the slots for his ""job well done."" This is only practical if you have a lot of wall space (it's big) and one board can only be used by one child. I do like that you can write in something like using the potty, ect."
5,Awesome,"We were having a few behavioral issues with our 3 year old & decided on this. It is wonderful! It comes with many responsibility magnets that range from very small/young to older, even into preteen years! Very durable. Our 3 year old LOVES earning her smiley faces. We also take away smiley faces for misbehavior & it is working very well. You won't regret this purchase!"
4,good idea,"this takes parental dedication to work. hope i'm up for the challenge. hopefully it won't end up being ""just magnets"" for the fridge."
4,Good tool for teaching responsibility.,We are using this with our 5 yr old twin boys. We are trying to modify behavior and teach more responsibility. We like that it is interactive giving them a sense of responsibility keeping up with the smiley faces. I wish it had some blank circles that I could make my own faces.I would recommend this item.
5,Resposibility Chart,Great tool for teaching my toddler grand daughter responsibility in a way that is fun for her. She looks forward to placing the magnets when she completes her chores.
4,awesome,I love hit it helps my son learn how to deal with his responsibilities and help him through his day so he can get his rewards
4,Great way to get the job done!!,"We were very impressed at how easily our 6 year old took to doing his chores and homework. Before we got this we constantly had to tell him what he needed to do, but since we bought this chart, we rarly have to remind him!! He enjoys being able to see his progress an receive his treat at the end of the week if he followed through with his homework and chores. It's great to be able to change the tasks and add your own. This is a very effective tool to start establishing responsiblity without all the fuss. We love it!"
2,Board warps within a couple of days after opening and hanging on the wall,The product was timely delivered as advertised. My kids (ages 3 and 5) are really enjoying and getting into it. The only problem is that the wood board warped within a couple of days after opening and hanging on the wall
3,Much easier than the sticker system!,This is so much easier thank making a sticker chart and no MESS! I was able to get the kids organized easily and they enjoy doing there chores and getting a smiley face etc. Thanks
1,Bowed and Warped,I bought two of this chart and two calendars by Melissa and Doug to give to my grandchildren. I was very excited to get the product but was very disappointed in the quality. The wood on all four units was badly warped. They will not lay flat against the wall and therefore will not stay up properly. Very disappointed indeed.
2,Very cheap quality,"I was SO excited to receive this responsibility chart for my 3yo son, but I am seriously disappointed in the quality! The straps aren't the same length so the bottom panel hangs unevenly, and I had to glue some of the magnets back together straight out of the package. At least he's happy with it, and hopefully it encourages good behaviors!"
3,Great incentive - for some,"I bought this for my almost 4-year-old and he was excited about it for a week before getting tired of it. It's a great toy, but only works with kids that respond to those kind of rewards. The promise of a jelly bean works better in my house!"
4,"Great ""toy"" with a valuable lesson.","Hoping not to be redundant I'll go to the ""nuts and bolts"": The chart works great with my kids. We work it like this: Every night I set it up, in the morning the kids and I go over their own board and then before bed we go over what they did during the day. I give them their coins and they put them on the board themselves. We tally their results every sunday after church, then they get the money they earned thru the week. I compliment this toy with Dave Ramsey's Junior's Adventures Bank for a complete financial lesson. The board itself is well built although one of them began warping over time."
5,the perfect solution,"My kids look forward to doing their charts at the end of the day. They can select which jobs they want to focus on for the upcoming week. They decide how well they performed their jobs and then receive their allowance accordingly! The charts are colorful, flexible, and fun for the kids to use. This beats pencil and paper, or wipe off charts that we had been using."
5,Love it!,"I love this Chart and so does my child (at the moment). We go over it ever night and if he gets all the smiley faces he gets an extra book at bed time and if he gets a majority of the smiley faces for the week he gets a movie. It teaches him cause and effect of his actions for the day, days of the week, and how to earn rewards that are not in the moment. I just wish there were more blank blocks to write your own stuff on and you can seperate the two boards (too much to play with). Melissa and Doug have great products. Highly recommend, even at 2 1/2 years of age."
5,This has been a great learning tool for my 4-year old!!,"We recently purchased this responsibility chart and it has been a great resource!! My 4-year old has been spending a lot of time whining and being unwilling to pick up her toys. We decided to give this a try and it has been wonderful. She runs into our room each morning and exclaims, ""I made my bed- can a put a magnet on my chart?"" The chart provids positive reinforcement for all types of behaviors. I especially like the magnets that focus on problem behaviors such as hitting and whining. The chart is durable, simple to use and understand, and very child focused. I have been recommending this chart to friends and family!! Another great piece by ""Melissa and Doug""!!"
4,great chart,"This responsibility chart works great with my ten year old daughter. We used a wooden chore wheel for the longest time, but were not able to find another one when it finally broke. This chart is even better because we can use it to figure out her allowance. she has five goals a day, six on Saturday, and each goal is worth 25 cents, so she can make up to $9.00/week. We plan to buy another chart for our four year old since he's going to start doing chores this summer. This chart would be great for children under 13. There are tons of goals to choose from and you can make your own."
3,A must have for parents,"I love this chart. I love the categories you can choose from (stay dry, no hitting, no whining) and the fact that you can write in your own. My son loves the bright colors and designs and likes putting his reward magnet in the right space. I do think it has helped my son learn what our family expects. You can store all the extra magnets on the bottom half, but it looks messy so I prefer to use that section as a dry-erase message board and store the extra magnets in a baggie... just my opinion! This is well worth the money if you're looking for a chore or responsibility chart."
5,Fun way to teach your kids about responsibility!,"I bought these for my kids @ 1/2 price when Melissa & Doug toys were 50% off right before Christmas. Best deal ever! My girls are 5 and 3 and they each have their own set of responsibilities. They love going up to the chart and earning their magnets each day because they know when they have it filled, they get something special (their choice)! The boards are well built, too and the magnets are sooo cute! There are also two blank magnets so you can make up your own tasks for them to do. Worth every penny!"
3,"cute, but ...",This is adorable with great magnets. My only disappointment is that there is only a space for like 5 chores and all the other magnets go at the bottom. Don't like that.
4,very happy,We are on week number three with using the responsibility chart and it has been wonderful. I would highly recommend it to everyone!!!
4,"Great Incentive, for now!","We purchased this item for our almost 5yo to help him keep track of his chores. He loves to ""get magnets"" so it's working for now. May wear off it's novelty soon. I can definitely forsee a time in the future where the smiley faces peel off of the magnets though. It seems pretty durable but is REALLY large. It's bigger than the full size wall calendar that hangs on our fridge!Overall a cute product that will at least get them into the spirit! And MUCH cheaper than in stores (Especially if you have prime!) I paid 20+tax and shipping and returned it to the store when I found it here and saved 8.00. Not much but it sure adds up!"
3,Lita,We use this to teach my grandson (5) to be responsible. We check the chart at the end of the week along with him so he can see the progress he made. We determine what it is that he gets for the each activity.
4,Great Idea,This is a really good idea and both my girls really got into it. We made a big deal out of the tokens and give them $.05 for each token at the end of each week.
5,great tool,"This has been a great tool for my 4 year old, not only for doing chores, but for learning to automatically do things like show respect and say please and thank you. I highly recommend this."
3,Serves its purpose,"I like the board, the only issue that I have is that the top board was warped and the magnets aren't as strong. But all in all, it is working with my 3yr old."
4,Great Way to Visualize Efforts,"We have two 9 month old babies and it is not as easy as it once was to give immediate feedback and reinforcement to my preschooler for a job well done. To top that off, it is more important than ever that jobs actually get done more independently (get dressed etc). This chart is a great way for my almost-4-year-old to receive immediate feedback when he completes a task. I like that you are able to change what responsibilities are important but I would like it if there were more spaces to put the current responsibilities."
5,Excellent resource to help families with their obtaining structure in the home,"I am a behavioral specialist consultant, as well as an outpatient counselor. I work with children most often. I found this item (Magnetic responsibility chart) to be an excellent item for helping families managing their childs behaviors to get them to be compliant with chores, helping them increase responsiblities and social skills thus helping to improve family relationships as well. I would recommend this to all professionals who work with children's behaviors as well as parents in helping get their child's compliance, avoid chaos in the home, improve structure, relationships and make life much more pleasant for all in the family."
4,great for teaching accountability and rewards,"This is a really convenient and understandable way to convey responsibility to kids. My kids naturally want to help out, and this chart makes their contributions seem more tangible.Things I like:-durable materials, sturdy magnets-categories have pictures so even preschoolers can participate-my kids are totally excited to add a magnet to the chart-comes with a few blank pieces to create your own categoryThings I wish:-that it could track more than one child more easily-that it had more achievements for younger kids instead of so many similar chores-that they had used the bottom half for something other than storing magnets"
5,Great incentive for child,I bought this for my 6 year old son. I thought it would be a good incentive for him to do well & remain positive. He loves it & so do I. He really enjoys putting the magnets on there as he knows he has done a good job with something. It really helps when doing his homework too. I would definitely recommend!
4,Great for kids!,"I ordered this for my 5 year old son.He was so excited when it came. We hung it on his wall, and every evening before bed, we mark off the responsibilities he has done that day. I love how it looks in his room, and he is definitely keeping his room cleaner since that is one of his tasks and he doesn't want to miss getting a smiley face. There is a wide variety of jobs listed on the magnets, so we can change it at any time. I love that it comes with more simple tasks for littler kids (such as brushing teeth, getting dressed) and love that it came with blank ones as well. We highly recommend this!"
4,"okay, my kids like it",My kids love to get their magnets at the end of the day. I was disapointed to see that when my magnets were cut they were not done so very nicely. Some of the pictures are partially cut off and the same with some of the words. Other than that the kids like it!
4,Only semi-motivational,"We love Melissa and Doug products. This ""Responsibility Chart"" is as attractive and well-made as any of their products. Our 9 year old is typically enticed to accomplish tasks when she has a chart or list, but this chart is sometimes used, sometimes not."
3,"Okay, but not great.","I liked the idea of my four-year old having a responsibility chart. I even like the wide assortment of chore magnets they give you, plus extras that you can make up your own chores with. However, a few days after I bought it, the wood frame started to buckle and bow. It lost it's shape and now bulges out from the wall. Some of the magnets fall off in the more bulging areas. Great concept, but could be made better for the price they charge!"
3,The quality has gone down...,I bought one of these charts for my oldest daughter last year. It really is a great responsibility chart. I wouldn't have changed a thing. So this year I decided to buy my youngest daughter one of her own. The one we received this time is a much lower quality. The magnets are about half the thickness of the one we got last year. Seems everyone is cutting corners these days to save a buck. Sad to see Melissa & Doug follow suit.
4,Worth for money!,It's a good tool to encourage children to become responsible for the stuff they have done!Item is great!
4,magnetic chart review,This product is great my kids just love it. They are really doing a great job with picking up toys. I do not have to be as much of an authority the board also helps with that part. The set up of the chart is awesome. The only part I feel needs improvement is that I feel there needs to be one more place to store the magnets. Maybe a tri fold. The 2nd area below the chart could be used as a white board area for the kids for extra special tasks etc. I was very pleased though with this product. You could always put the magnets in a baggie and use a tack to keep it beside the chart or one of those hooks and put the magnets in a cloth bag with drawstring.
4,Nice Chart,"The chart is nice, does everything a chart should and definitely attracts the attention of kids with the colors and pictures. However, the tokens are just the right size for little mouths so if you have a small child, hang it up much higher than they can reach. I had to take mine down and haven't re-hung it yet because I got paranoid about my 1 year old eating the tokens (I've found one in her mouth since purchasing)."
2,warped,product as described but arrived very warped. (made of wood). I should have returned it but hoped it would flatten out and it didn't . It will be usable.... just ugly. I am used to Melissa and Doug products being problem-free.
4,love it works great for my five year old,My son looks forward to putting his magnets on his completed responsibilities each night. Had to put aside some magnets though as there are a ton.
3,It's Okay,"It's not quite what I was expecting. Several of the ""chores"" or ""responsibilities"" were not what I was expecting. I was hoping for more of the daily chores to be an option to use. I have considered sending it back. I will do more research before purchasing something like this online again."
5,Great chart,My 5 year old wanted this chart and she loves it. She likes to check in daily at the things she has done or should do. I like it as well because she has found it so motivating.
4,Didn't Wonder Woman have one of those invisible jets too?,"The second studio album from Florida's Michael Donaldson finds his Q-Burns alias looking more like a band. The majority of these tracks feature Lisa Shaw doing a nice job on vocals, with other vocal appearances by Elmo Williams (doing the alt.blues thing on ""Mother's Dead"") and Swamburger kicking the rhymes on ""Imprisoned Glitch"". Stylistically this disc is all over the place, bouncing from house to pop to blues to rap to folk to tr*p-h*p. There are plenty of uptempo dance beats, but also plenty of guitars and front-and-center melodies."
3,"Great songs, but a problem...","This CD+G has a great selection of duets from a number of different genres, but be warned. There are no lead vocal tracks, so if you don't know the songs there is no guide to help you learn them."
3,The Greatest Duet Songs - 50 Songs,"A quality CD+G set, but incorrectly advertised to contain several duet songs which were NOT on the discs. Two songs I really needed were ""Almost Paradise"" and ""You Don't Bring Me Flowers"", both of which had been removed and replaced by other songs because of copyright infringement.....wish I'd known that before I spent my money!"
3,Ordered too late,I placed this order too late to use it this year. I have the train set and it matched the others and fit well so I'm assuming it will be fine.
1,POWDERY TASTE TO THESE CHIPS ~ BUT MY DOG LIKES THEM!,"I love hummus and garlic so I thought these chips would be just right for me. However, I did not like them because they taste like they are made with powder ingredients. The reason for that is that they are ACTUALLY MADE WITH: ""GARBANZO FLOUR, GARLIC POWDER, ONION POWDER, SOY FLOUR, POTATO STARCH & CORN STARCH"". Hence the reason for the powdery taste. Yuck! But the good thing is that my dog likes them, but then she likes everything."
1,didnt work,Installed it and followed the installation instructions and it didnt work didnt even get warm dont buy one very disappointed.
1,wrong part,this is the wrong item for the 6.0 motor it is a screw in type there are no frost plugs on this motor
2,Sister Naomi Reveals the Truth,"Janet's sister Naomi Klein has written a book in which she exposes the real purpose behind Janet's attempt to ""re-brand nostalgia"" and dominate the market in retro-chic genre music via the corporate-controlled world media.""Come into my parlor, said the spider to the fly..."" If you start listening to this kind of music, next thing you know you'll be trapped into buying Hilary Duff calendars and Britney Spears videos, before finally being immobilized in the corporate web and having your liquified innards sucked out of your thorax. Watch out!"
3,Mostly for the JOS devotees,"In the vast Jimmy Smith discography you will always find some ""weak and uninspired"" albums on the average, and Black Cat is one of them. This CD has largely the same content as Daybreak (WestWind 2133) with Jimmy in an unusual interplay with flute-master Nestor Torres on most tracks and stallmate Phil Upchurch on some tracks. Nothing new with familiar tunes like Moanin', Satin Doll and Eight Counts for Rita - basic JOS organ groove on semi-automatic. By mistake the album sleeve indicates a bassist on 4 tracks - no elbass og doublebass can sound like organbass when Jimmy hits the pedals. Since the concert with Nestor Torres is available on DVD, you might find the visuals more interesting than the CD.. Average album only for JOS devotees and completist."
1,IT's a REVIEW **** 8 Minutes ***** WT*??,"You MUST be kidding me. You want to include a REVIEW in my list of 'free' things I can watch now ""instantly"" --- this is such a joke!!! Why not let everyone watch it for free??? ITS A REVIEW? What decent movies can I actually watch for free as an Amazon Prime member? Have you taken your business direction from Netflix?????"
4,What I Think,I like this movie. It's a great action movie and keep you on your toes. I wanted to know what was good to happen next. Tom Cruise makes great movies. A great get togather movie with the family.
1,poor preview,Extended preview is pointless. Shows the first few min of the movie. The trailer is better. leaves you confused and wanting another movie. Not worth the time.
5,A good flick,"Really liked it, even our teenage daughter liked it and now has watched all the previous ones. Makes for a good popcorn night!"
4,A good introduction,"John Stover is a well-known and respected railroad historian, and his book on the B&O has been around for awhile. Readers looking for ""the romance of the rails,"" nostalgic memories of the ""Capitol Limited,"" etc. will not find it here. Rather, they'll find a good introduction to the history, life and times of the Baltimore & Ohio. This one belongs on the shelf of all with an interest in eastern railroads."
5,A Great Product,Love this one. Feels like my teeth have been professionally cleaned after every brush. The built in timer - letting you know when to move to a different section of your mouth - is a nice feature. Just wish it has a brush head holder.
4,good price,"I'm not sure why the price was so low, but I got this toothbrush for about $48. With the Oral B Rebate of 50%, I couldn't go wrong. The final price was $24.This is my first powered toothbrush. For the most part, it's great, but there are a few things I would change having used someone else's power toothbrush.1.) There is no reservoir on the back of the stand to hold other toothbrushes.2.) There is only one speed. I would probably only use the high speed though, so it's not that big of a deal.3.) The toothbrush warns you every 30 seconds to move on to the next part of your mouth. (You're supposed to spend 30 seconds on each quadrant of your mouth.) It's not such a bad thing, but I prefer just the final 2 minute warning, as I don't need my toothbrush micro-managing my time."
3,Does the job....,"I had used the Sonicare brand for at least ten years. Just got tired of the high prices everyone was asking for them. Tried the Oral-B and can say it does clean the teeth, just is a different circular type of brush movement versus the up and down movement of Sonicare. I'm sure I'll get use to it....and for the difference in price.....yeah, think I'll adjust just fine. My teeth are just as clean as with the Sonicare."
4,Best Price on the Web for this unit,"I've been using electric toothbrushes for over a year now. They do a great job on cleaning my teeth. I love the rechargeable feature, the two minute timer and the speed settings. The only drawback is that the brush is stiff. I would rinse it in the water before using it. It will also take time for your teeth to feel comfortable with this unit."
2,Warning for dental implants,"This toothbrush did a great job and I loved how my teeth felt after cleaning, but after just 1 week of use the vibrations loosened the screw in my dental implant. At the time I'd only had the implant for 7 weeks and the dentist had just put in the permanent filling to cover the screw the same day I started using the toothbrush. I was panicked that the implant had failed, but I did some googling and found some information that the vibrations from the toothbrush can loosen dental implant screws. I don't want to take the chance that this will happen again, I don't want the screw to become stripped. So I will not be using this toothbrush, or any electric toothbrush for that matter. Luckily, my spouse can continue to use it."
5,Some things you CAN count on.,"The first Oral B (similar model) that I had lasted more than 10 years, so when it finally died I looked for one that was as close as possible to it. I have been extremely happy with my purchase, the product has all the options that I find useful, and as usual Amazon offers the best overall prices."
1,Wrong product . . . TWICE,"I ordered the 7550 and received the 7400. so I returned it and requested the correct product. Again the 7400 arrived. This time I called Braun who makes the Oral-B product line. They explained that the 7400 and 7550 are the same toothbrushes, but that the 7550 comes with extra toothbrush heads. I called Amazon and requested a refund for the price difference. They couldn't do it because the 7400 is actually more expensive than the 7550 even though they are the same product except that the 7440 contains fewer replacement brush heads. This is really crummy, but I am starting to travel now and just decided to get wronged and keep the 7400 because I needed a new toothbrush ASAP."
1,Product not available,"If you order this product, you will receive a model 7400, not a 7550. I had to return it twice and ended up buying it elsewhere. It should be removed from the listing."
4,Very good product but...,"I got the toothbrush on time and it works great. Brushing my teeth hasn't ever been so easy and even fun but(yeah, there's a but)... my dentist told me that it's not as good as a manual toothbrush (if properly used) and COULD affect my gums ealth. Therefore, before buying one talk to your dentist."
3,A little louder than I expected or like.,"I'm up and out early before the rest of the house and i would have preferred that this be a little quieter. I like the functionality and form, but the noise makes me reluctant to use it when others are sleeping. Likely just my perception, but it's enough to limit it's use for me."
3,Is my unit working correctly?,"Just picked up an Oral-B Professional Care 1000 after using a Sonicare for years. . . even my wife, who has another Oral-B model, thinks this one is loud. And the vibration: makes my nose itch. And my nose isn't THAT big. . .Does everyone experience the high vibration and noise?"
4,Oral B 1000 Power Toothbrush,"I charged it for 18 hours as it requested from the get go. Once I start it up, after about every 15-20 seconds, it hiccups for 1 second. Not bad of a product. Feels different since I use less toothpaste now (compared to brushing manually). I feel like a lazy hygienist now, with the lack of desire to brush my own teeth because the feeling of ""Success!"" and ""Clean!"" isnt' there anymore. However, I will use this product until it is dead. I also bought it discounted from the amazon gold box.If there were no hiccups, I'd give it a 4. that's the main defect (with mine at least). I do like the waterproof-ness, but I don't need it since I don't brush in the shower.-MCUpdate: Upping to 4star"
5,Bought because of braces,The toothbrush doesn't work very well with cleaning behind the braces but does the job very well everywhere else. I have to go back and clean behind the braces with a different toothbrush but the oral-b is worth all the praise it is getting. It is a very solid toothbrush and the mail in rebate offer made it a lot sweeter.
5,The best toothbrush ever,"You must use it to believe it since this is my 4th oral B, 1000, 4000, 5000 models which all good, you'll feel the different after brush, and will buy them and use them as always since it is the only best out there, no bad thing so far to tell.....Go buy it."
4,I should have bought one earlier,I didn't believe electric brush performs better than manual until I bought this. It really does a good job. The only complain I have is it's getting louder.
4,Good Toothbrush,"Pretty good toothbrush. Did not know that their wasn't a sensitive setting on this one. Works well for my son's braces, just a little bit too powerful."
2,Braun Oral B Power Toothbrush,"The item works well enough, but is nowhere as good as the one I had previously, also from Braun. That one is still available, but costs a bit more.I am sorry that I did not buy itThe new toothbrush takes forever to charge and needs to be re-charged continuously. There is no way I could take it on even a short trip.Also there is only one speed which is on the slow side."
4,Does what it is supposed....,This toothbrush does what it is supposed to do. Go figure...LOL. Great powered brush for the money. Just make sure you dry the brush before you place it on the charger. If you don't it will start building junk up on the bottom and on the charger.
4,good product for the price,I bought this for my son. He has a tendency to brush too hard. It was recommended by our dentist that he should use an electric one. This product works well.
3,Wrong product model.,"Out of 5 stars, I subtracted one star because I did not receive the correct product model. I ordered an Oral-B Professional Care 7550 Power Toothbrush, but I received a 7400 model. I subtracted one more star because I did not experience the customer service and therefore cannot recommend it. According to my invoice, Target.direct sold me the product. I ordered a new product and received a new product. My power toothbrush has been functioning fully since I received it near the beginning of June 2007."
3,poor service,1. ordered model 75502. received model 74003. returned model 74004. reordered model 75505. received model 7400 again6. returned model 7400 on 01/177. still waiting for my refund this 02/08
1,Planned obsolescence.,This toothbrush is good while it works but it will eventually completely stop working because of the battery which you can't replace. I'll never buy one again and suggest you reconsider your purchase.
2,Not sure what all the fuss is about,"I finally got this toothbrush after I have seen alot of people use them. I am very disappointed. The design of the brush and the charger seems really outdated and bulky. It's constantly getting dirty with dust and tooth paste. It's very hard to clean. It's loud, and small brush. Not to mention the replacements for the brush are too expensive. No thank you."
5,Oral-B Professional Care 7400 Rechargeable Toothbrush,"After reviewing several electric toothbrushes, I decided on the Oral-B 7400. I didn't realize at the time that there is only one cleaning mode but that turned out to be okay. I thought I might need a sensitive mode in order to not hurt my gums. Instead, I ordered softer brush refills which solved the problem. I drink tea which stains my teeth. I tried baking soda to remove the stain but that didn't help. After using this brush for a few weeks, the stains were gone. Like others have said in their reviews, my dental hygienist noticed an improvement in my teeth. I'm very happy with this brush and have bought two more for my daughters."
2,Fine while it's working,"I paid the full... for mine, but had to return it just 3 months laterwhen it stopped working. The very unfriendly people at Braun sent me anew one (eventually), but that only worked for another 9 months untilit too stopped. I enjoyed using it, but I won't bother getting anotherone until Braun get a quality control system in place."
1,"No setting for ""Sensitive"" gums/teeth","I already have an Oral-B Professional Care 9000 (discontinued), which has several settings. I always use ""sensitive"" but learned AFTER I opened THIS package (the 1000) that the 1000 does NOT have this feature. The feature IS listed in the manual, but is not available on this particular model. Very disappointing--and I just cannot use the 1000. My gums just cannot take the beating."
2,Poor Quality,"I bought this toothbrush about 4 months ago and was really pleased with it until it stopped working recently. It will turn on, but will slow down and eventually stop well before the recommended 2 minutes is up! For the price, I would expect better quality control!"
2,Beware Buyers,"Although I ordered the model 7550, I received model 7400. From the Amazon opinion survey, I knew this was a very common complaint among buyers of this product, but I didn't heed their warnings. It was too late to return the items (I bought two) before Christmas so Amazon offered me a discount for the mistake. I took the discount, then found the model 7400 two days later at a cheaper price in the local Bed, Bath & Beyond. In the end, I paid shipping charges to receive the wrong product at a rotten price. Beware."
3,Nothing Special,"This is a good toothbrush..as far as toothbrushes go but it's really not worth the money. The replacement heads cost quite a bit of money. Overall, this electric toothbrush does about the same as ones that are a third of the price."
5,Promotes excellent oral hygiene,"My dentist suggested this brush to me 4 years ago. It has reversed my gingivitis, prevented ALL cavaties, and improved my breath.Everyone should be using this brush if they want to keep their gums healthy."
4,Excellent plaque and tartar control.,"I have crooked teeth and have always had problems controlling tartar buildup. Even flossing is difficult because the floss gets trapped between teeth.Within a week of using this toothbrush I noticed a clear reduction in tartar. It was actually scrubbing off the tartar like a dentists cleaning. This was using the special Oral B toothpaste, which has a gritty feel, like what the dentist uses.Now I alternate between the gritty (advantage) tootpaste and ordinary toothpaste. I am far happier with my standard of dental hygiene and with the condition of my gums.Also, you can share the same toothbrush between different people as the heads are interchangeable, and are colour coded for just this purpose.The one drawback is the expense of new heads for the toothbrush. They are expensive."
3,"Effective, but bulky and impossible to clean","After a lot of great use, I'm ready to replace my Oral B power toothbrush with a new one -- and I'm not going to purchase this one again.Although it does a great job of cleaning teeth, the cap protecting the replacement heads broke off after just a few months of use.Plus, it takes up a lot of room and tips over quite easily, which is annoying in a busy bathroom.It's also impossible to clean. This is what's really making me choose a different type of power toothbrush. It's just so unhygenic when toothpaste, moisture and who knows what builds up in a portion of the device that is underneath where the additional toothbrush heads rest. You have to take the device apart to try to reach it, but it takes far too much time--and sponges, Q-tips and whatever else I can squeeze in there--to try to scoop it all out and make it clean. There's got to be a better alternative."
5,Good purchase,"My teeth have never been cleaner. From the first time I used it and licked my teeth to feel how clean they were, I was impressed. I have never done nearly as good a job with a manual brush. And if this model can deliver that level of performance, I don't see the need to spend triple digits on another kind."
4,Good toothbrush,"This is a replacement for a Braun power toothbrush, and it is good. One neat thing this one does is pulse a couple of times every 30 seconds, so you know when 2 minutes are up, and so you can spend 30 seconds on each quadrant of your mouth. On not so good thing about this toothbrush is that you can't mount the base/charger on the wall. (I could with the old Braun.) Which means it just stands on the sink, and every week or so I pull the charger out and have the cord every which way across the sink. Remember - don't get the plug wet!"
4,Excellent,"The Oral-B 1000 power toothbrush is an excellent product for its purpose. I thoroughly enjoy using it and my teeth always feel and look good. The one thing I noticed is that it doesn't hold a charge as long as my older one; however, it is easy enough to recharge. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a basic model."
1,Buddhists can also hate one another.,"This piece of anonymous trash is of undeniable journalistic and historical interest. The English reads from one cover, the Chinese from the other. The English, at least, contains no authorial, publication, translation or distribution credits. It is a hate piece directed against Tibetan Buddhism, composed by a Malaysian Ch'an monk infuriated by the successful missionary and fund-raising activities of Tibetan lamas among the Chinese communities of Southeast Asia. It has been distributed by the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas and its affiliates in Northern California."
4,use for on road not off road sand,I thought I had some engine problems but realized the sand from driving in the outback sticks to the oil in the filter and plugs it up. So basically if you are on-road then this filter is really good but if you take the vehicle off road in dunes or sandy areas with lots of sand getting kicked up then keep a spare paper filter. I even tried keeping two of these but it plugs up pretty much on one 10km lap to prevent the vehicle from exceeding 70mph (110kph) off road.
4,A good referance for the experienced autocad user,"AutoCad Instant Reference book is small but a complete book with a quick and easy listing of the New Features with Release 14. The comand descriptions are short and to the point. However before purchasing this book, I would strongly suggest that you have a good understanding of AutoCad 12, and 13."
2,Easy to read but not too helpful,"It's very easy to read, and rather comprehensive in the sense that it covers everything regarding management of the non profit. But it's not as helpful as I will like as it doesn't really go into details and the how to's and the examples and such. I would've liked more of that."
2,How to Manage an Effective Nonprofit Organization;,"This was not as helpful as I had hoped. A lot of ""lists"" but not a lot of solid information."
1,Terrible Software,My wife and I have spent the last four days attempting to understand and use Peachtree First Accounting for our small business. This is a very difficult piece of software to learn and use and I would strongly suggest you save your money and try something different.We are now preparing to order a different software package and will be selling Peachtree to someone who perhaps has a degree in accounting.
2,For small ankles only!,"I was looking forward to receiving this product. I have chronic Achilles tendon pain and this looked like a great way to help the problem. I bought a L/XL. I have rather large ankles but not so large as to not fit the supposed size of the ""heel pad"". When I opened it up I thought it must be a child size. The gel part of the sleeve and the fabric looked really nice, but the band at the top (ankle/lower calf) was tiny! I cannot imagine what a small/medium would be! My husband has small ankles but wouldn't even try it on to check the size, too small for him, too. What's odd is the rest of the piece would have fit. What a shame a good-looking product could be so off on the sizing."
3,"Great Shaver at First, but poor after 6 months","I should have listened to the last few reviews and not purchase this shaver. At first, I was incredibly impressed with the shaving performance of this instrument. Expect to replace the Foil and cutterblock after 6 months, which is falsely advertised in their product manual as being 18 months. I take care of the shaver as instructed by the manual and was very happy until replacing the foil and Cutterblock. I didn't care about purchasing the pricy accessories (foil/cutterback and cleaning solutions) as long as I get a good shave. Advise to everyone; please reconsider buying this product because you'll be paying for a great 6 month shaver. I will be returning to the manual shaving until I find a better lasting method."
4,"Wow, nice shaver!!",I don't want to talk about the specs since it's all there.This is a coool shaver.It shaves really close.In most cases one reason you choose manual rather than automatic shaver is because it cut's loose while manual shaver cuts very clean. We use automatic shaver becuase it is convenient regaredless of that loose cut.But I think this shaver cuts pretty clean compared to other items I have used before.Don't hesitate.
2,Chronic motor problem,"This is a great shaver when it works. After a couple months of owning it, the motor became extremely loud and shaved poorly. I took it to a certified repair shop, and got in line behind all of the other model 7526 shavers that also had this problem. It got fixed in about a month, and it lasted about another year or so when the new motor also went out. This seems to be a chronic problem with these shavers."
2,Be careful of the switch,"First, I claim partial responsibility for the thing falling apart. I should not have put it in my carry-on without wrapping it in something soft. Anyway, when I got home from a trip the switch fell off, then the piece under the switch fell out, and then, well it got messy. Unfortunately, it was the best shave I have ever gotten from an electric razor. However, if it can't take a little shoving around on a plane, well I'm avoiding Braun for awhile."
1,Braun Syncro Shaver,"Bought this item as a gift for my husband. He says it has never done a good job of shaving his neck area. Recently, it stopped working correctly, seemed to jam and was difficult to turn off. Bought my husband a diffent brand of razor. He is MUCH happier with the new brand. No more Braun shavers for him!"
2,"A decent shave, but accesories too expensive for their worth","This razor gives a typically decent Braun shave. The only problem I have with this product is that the replacement foils (approx. $30) and cleaner refills are expensive--I've found that I get only a couple of ""cleanings"" out of each refill."
3,"Great shaver, costly upkeep","I agree with many of the reviews below: This is a great electric shaver -- if you're willing to spring regularly for new parts. I've had mine for about two years, and can report: The foil on the shaver really does wear out about every six months, not every 18 months. And to replace it, you have to buy both the cutting block and foil at a cost of about 30 bucks. And the charging/cleaning system -- a concept which, for my money, makes electric shaving worthwhile, won't last. The charging arm at the top more than likely WILL break, and you either have to go through the hassle of having it serviced, or buy a new stand for about 40 bucks through Braun. If all that is worth the convenience of using this otherwise nice shaver, it's for you. If not, save your money."
4,Great Razor,"I feel that this razor is as good if not better than the Mach3 which I previously used. It is fast, cuts close, and it always clean thanks to the cleaning station. I do feel that it is very expensive but in my eyes was worth it because I no longer cut myself with a blade and I am able to shave quicker than before."
3,Same problem with Housing breaking,"Similar to another reviewr, I've also had the shaver for about 1.5 years, and the arm on mine broke, making the cleaning mechanism non-functional. Otherwise, I've been pleased with the shaver. I would buy one of braun systems where the cleaner does not have the little arm that extends up. Maybe that will solve the problem."
4,Great gift for young men!,We bought this shaver for our son's 21st birthday. He just loves it. The cleaning system makes it practical for men in a hurry to keep the unit clean and sharp. The only down side is the cleaning trays that need to be changed regularly to keep the unit working properly. A suggestion would be to buy a few to keep on hand so you aren't caught without one.
5,This Gadget Actually Works,"I have been a Norelco user for many years. This shaver shaves much closer than the Norelco and I don't get small nicks under my chin and neck anymore.If you hate cleaning your shaver, the Clean & Charge stand is great. After the self cleaning cycle, I took the foil and cutting blades apart and could not find a trace of stubble. But, if you take out the cleaning solution reservoir out, you can see all the stubbles that have been cut on the bottom.It's a great deal"
1,"Good shaver, bad cleaner design, bad support","The good news: I like the shaver. I get a close, comfortable shave, and the shaver feels good to use.The bad news: The cleaning/charging stand lasted about 3 months. The latch broke that holds the shaver in, and so it can't be cleaned or charged in the stand. I contacted Braun, and apparently, I'm not ""technically inclined"" enough to replace the entire charging stand. I have to send it in to a service center, wait 4 weeks or more, and have them send me a new stand back.NOT recommended."
3,Good Shave but Problems,"I have used Remington and Norelco for years and went to Braun for the self-cleaning feature. After about the third shave, I started getting closer shaves than I had ever gotten with the Norelco or Remington. I was extremely pleased with the effortless cleaning and good shave for about four months, but then the shaving head began to sound like a chain saw. I shaved on that way for another three or four months before buying a replacement cutter head and foil thinking that would fix it. It didn't. I've gone back to my Norelco to keep from waking everyone in the house in the morning. Maybe I just got a lemon, but I'm going to try something else before I try Braun again."
2,Good but not durable,"I have had the Braun shaver now for about 2 years. When I first got it everything was great; good shave, the cleaning stand works well and I was very satisfied. However as time went on the screen that protects your face from the blades has become loose, mine actually had a hole wear through it. I replaced the blades and the screen with the kit from Braun, this helped a little but the screen was still very loose and rattles around while I shave. This makes it sound something like a chain saw and about as comfortable. The only thing I can do is to physically hold the guard down while I shave, this helps but the shave is still poor, and I get nicked quite often when shaving.Overall I am not happy with this product, and will probably not buy a braun again in the future."
3,Possible design flaw,"When I first got this shaver, I was so happy with it! The cleaning system is well thought out and works well. Cleaning supplies are probably good renewable income for the company...marketing genius. However, after I had owned this system for about a year, the charging handle that comes down onto the shaver from above would no longer stay connected. The latching mechanism broke and I could no longer charge or clean the system without manually holding the charging handle down. This effectively renders the system useless unless you want to manually clean the shaver yourself. I see that the newer designs no longer use this mechanism and the shaver merely sits in the cleaning well. I assume they charge from the side. Something to think about..."
3,Buy the Activator model instead,"After about a year and a half with this unit, I have gone through two cleaning stands. The latch breaks after a few months making the stand a pretty paperweight. Braun has tacitly acknowledged this design flaw by introducing the Activator model without a latch on the stand, using plain old gravity to hold the razor in. What a concept.For those of you who have broken your stands and don't want to shell out for a new razor, you can hunt around online and find a new replacement stand for $40-$50 as I did. Unfortunately it may not last you much longer than the first."
2,Underwhelmed,"I brought this shaver because I liked a very old (circa 1988) Braun shaver that I still have and that still works and on the strength of the Amazon user reviews. But I am underwhelmed, and now--6 months later--I see several mediocre reviews here! I agree with them. It does take a long time to shave, and I don't find that the shave is very close, especially on the neck.The cleaning stand is nice, and hopefully it won't break anytime soon.Perhaps I am asking too much from an electric. I bought a standard Norelco first and returned it for the money back guarantee. But my very old Braun did much better."
4,Alright really,"Pretty good, but I wasn't blown away by its performance.The shave is a reasonable quality, about the same as the $60 shaver I already owned.The cleaning feature is nice though but I don't yet know how long the cartridges last."
4,Good Shaver,"I recently got this shaver and am very pleased with it. The battery life is great and it gives you a nice clean shave. I especially love the fact that it cleans itself. The lubrication it uses emits a very pleasant lemony scent. One thing that I do not like about the razor is that the cleaning cycle is kind of loud, but other than that this razor is a great product and helps cut down on the time you spend shaving."
4,Easy Clean Up,"This razor gives a good close shave and for that I am pleased. However, the best part is the clean up. After shaving, just place the razor in the cleaner and push clean and charge and you'll be all set for your next shave."
5,MOST IMPRESSIVE,"I've always been hesitant of electrice razors, I had a real cheap one (20$ or so) when I first started shaving, and instead of cutting the hair it decided to pull it out. I read the reviews from amazon, and besides a couple poor ones about the foil and blade wearing out earlier than 18 months, i was sold.I got it home, and it works great, didnt pull a single hair out, cut just as close as my manual razor, the cleaning was quiet in my opinion, and i had no skin irritation. One thing i noticed was that the foil got kind of warm, and it kind of smelled like burning motor. Perhaps this is normal on the first time, or every time? (10 minutes of use) Let me know please. Other than that, as long as i dont burn it out, I love it!"
3,Wouldn't buy it again . . .,"As a life-long Braun user, I've owned a Syncro for 2 years now. It has its good points, but I wouldn't buy it again, because of the high cost of upkeep.The Good: nice, close shave, recharges very quickly, handy self-cleaning system.The Bad: because of the much smaller cutting block, shaves take MUCH longer than with older Brauns (2-3 times as long.) Also the cleaning cycle is very noisy, and the cost of the cleaning cartridges at $5 a pop can add up quickly. I extend the cartridge life by a month or two by adding Isopropyl alcohol when the red light goes on.The Ugly: The cutting block is a small, cheap piece of plastic with tiny little pieces of metal foil embedded for blades , These buggers break off very easily, and often do so within the first couple of months of routine shaving, rendering the shaver ineffective, with shaves taking even longer than the usual 5-7 minutes. A new block costs $20-25."
2,Expensive and doesn't last,"I recieved one of these for Christmass in 2002 and for the first 6 months it was great. Close shave (although not as a close as a $1.00 disposable blade but convienient) and east to use. However, at 6 months the foil somehow got a hole in it. I didn't notice it and the first pass of the razor left a long bloody scratch in my face. The new foil and blades were about $30.00. About 6 months later the same thing happened, then in April 2004 the cleaner stopped working. Counting up the refills and the repairs this thing has cost be almost $100.00 in a year, almost the cost of a new one. Feels like this little scheme is a revenue stream for Braun. I would seriously pass on this unit."
4,Good value,"Seems sturdier than the 7505. Don't know if the clean n' charge actually is necessary. It does clean the razor, but so does the brush that's included. I take out the cartridge after each use and recap it. Seems to last longer that way. I also just use the brush two thirds of the time. Razor works really well."
1,Very dissappointed,I bought the 7526 shaver and am very dissappointed. The worstproblem is the shaving head doesn't stay on. It's verydifficult to use when the shaving head pops off. The headattachment system if very badly designed. No matter whatI do the shaving head won't stay on.If I had known that I never would have bought this shaver.
1,To call it garbage is an injustice to garbage,"I bought this razor 8 months ago. After 4 months, the shaving screen began to come apart and had to be replaced. After 6 months, the device that provides the electrical connection to the razor would not stay down, and cleaning / charging would stop. A little piece of paper to provide more friction seemed to solve the problem. And now, the razor starts cleaning at any time, whether the razor is in the stand or not, spewing cleaning solution everywhere until its unplugged. When the razor is in the stand, it won't clean or charge. The shave was OK, but nothing special, and I will never by a Braun product again. This thing is junk."
2,Doesn't Last,"I have had this razor for three years. It has just died. The battery got extremely hot just before it quit working. Luckily, I came home and noticed it. It had a burned electrical smell. I'm not saying it would have caught on fire, but who knows. Also, the charging stand broke after using it about two years. It would not lock down on the razor. I was able to charge the razor by plugging the cord directly into it. I could not use the auto cleaning feature as well. The razor worked well for me and gave a close shave. It shaved closer than the Norelco's that I have had. The Norelco did shave faster with less passes and still keeps on working after many years. The Braun just doesn't seem to have good quality for the high price. I expected it to last longer than it did."
2,Long-term reliability sucks,"For anyone who has read each of the reviews, you must ask yourself how long the people reviewing this product have owned it. I owned one for about a year, and I can honestly say that it is an over-priced peice of junk.First, the refills are hard to find, and you can't use the cleaner/recharger without the refills. Second, it takes up a lot of vanity space. Third, and most important, it doesn't last very long.I bought the razor and I loved it. Six months later, it needed a new shaver head replacement. Six months after that the shaver started vibrating excessively, it sounded more like clippers than a razor. It was the end, it was broken. A replacement shaver costs $70 or more... I decided to buy a Norelco..."
2,A pricey disappointment,"OK now, don't get too excited about the Braun 7526. It looks fancy with all its features, such as automatically cleaning itself, but guess what - it misses out on one much more important aspects - providing a good shave.I used a Remington R-845 razor prior to the Braun. It usually sells at aroung $35 (or some $70 lower than the Braun). I decided to upgrade and was tremendously disappointed. The Braun cuts my face almost every time I shave and doesn't shave as closely! The neck is especially problematic - the Braun leaves almost everything on even after going over the area for minutes. I found myself going back to the Remington for this area, which is obviously ridiculous.Otherwise, the Braun looks very sturdy and is a good piece of machinery with all its lith indicators and good materials used. However, unless your beard is really soft and your skin is totally insensitive to cuts - it is not a good buy."
2,An irritating and incomplete shave,"I've owned this for about a year and a half and have changed the cutting block once, so I think I can say that I'm speaking from experience. The hairs that this shaver cuts are indeed cut very close. Unfortunately, it only cuts about half of your remaining hair in each pass, so you never get all of your stubble removed. You end up isolated stubble here and there, smooth skin in between, and irritated skin everywhere from making so many passes (at high pressure). I bought this for the cleaning system, thinking it would be cleaner and save me time in the morning. It may be cleaner, but it actually takes longer to shave. I'll be buying a Norelco that I can rinse with water and save my skin and the money I would otherwise spend on cleaning cartridges."
1,"Good electric shaver, BUT; charger/cleaner is JUNK!!","The shaver works fine, but; the charger/cleaner broke after 1 day use. My latch too would not latch!! I cound not reach Braun for a replacement sooooooooo I've been stuck with this piece of junk for well over a year. I use a piece of tape to hold it down, real swell!!!"
3,Good Shaver but Flawed,"This model gives a good, overall shave. I still have trouble on my neck area, but this has been typical of any electric shaver I've owned. The REAL reason I bought this was the self cleaning system. It works as advertised, but like so many other reviews I've seen, the locking mechcanism that supplies power to the razor, while its cleaning failed. There are a couple of work-arounds, but for $100, I expect the unit to perform longer than a year."
2,lousy shave,"Ive been using this product for 3 weeks now and it does a lousy job, doesn't get the hairs on my neck. I,m probably going back to my rotary razor and I will give this to my 16 year old.disappointed"
4,Great as far as Electrics!,"This is a great electric razor and does the best job as far as electrics. The cleaning system is great. However, my handle latch broke on the system, but no big deal I suppose I just tape it down with some scotch tape (use a strip or two.) The cleaning refills you don't have to keep buying, you can actually just refill one with alcohol and keep using one. All that is in thoughs refills is alcohol and fragrance. You also don't have to have the cleaning system at all, you can just clean the old fashioned way w/ the brush and Remington Shaver Spray. All in all though, great razor."
3,BEWARE! you CANNOT return this item to amazon!,"Due to the fact that the cleaning cartridge contains alcohol - this item is NOT returnable to amazon. Period. It does state this policy under the ""shipping restrictions"" link in the description - so I do take responsibility for not having read every single link in the description. However, I do think the link would have been more properly labeled ""shipping & return restrictions."" Never during the entire check out process was it made clear that the item was not returnable.While the customer service lady was very nice and sympathetic, there was nothing she could do. Just to warn others who are thinking of purchasing to make sure you really want it before buying!"
1,Over Priced Piece of,"Braun, a German company with a good reputation. Thought I'd give this razor a try.A terrible decision! If you want a close shave, this is not the razor for you. My old, $49 Remington and Norelco razors shaved much closer, much quieter, and much less expensively. Don't waste your money on this piece of German engineering."
4,great shaver..terrible system,"This is the best shaver I've ever used, but it's flawed by the cleaning system. Other reviewers have commented on the same issue: it breaks. Forget the system, and save money on fluid; just buy the razor solo, or throw the system out...it will last 5 years or so."
2,Not Durable,"I purchased a Braun 7526 self cleaning synchro shaver after owning many braun shavers in the past. The most frustrating problem that I encountered was the housing that contains the shaver for storage and cleaning. After 1 1/2 years the arm that locks the shaver in place would not stay down and lock the shaver into position. The locking mechanism simply wore out from removing and replacing the shaver after use. Once the arm is unlockable, the shaver cannot be cleaned or recharged in the housing. You have essentially lost cleaning and charging capability. I was very disappointed that the locking mechanism was so poorly constructed. There is no solution but to purchase a whole new shaver and cleaning housing."
2,Better Products Elsewhere,"This shaver gives a really nice shave, and the cleaning stand is nice. However, I've owned this product for less than 5 years, and the cleaning stand has broken three times. The stand slides down into the top of the shaver to recharge the shaver and power the stand, and it commonly breaks where it won't lock in the down position, therefore it won't power the stand. The first two times it broke under warranty, and I ""only"" had to pay $10 to have it shipped to a repair facility. The third time is out of warranty, and after calling customer service was told sorry, they can't do anything now that it is out of warranty. Not what I expected from a Braun, I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
4,"A good read, playing the game helps..",I am a fan of the Tex Murphy games so bought this book to see the differences between the two. I found the book to be an interesting read but I think it helps if you have played the game first as it helps with the humor etc. I would still recommend it even if you haven't played the game :)
4,It was great and much more Tex!,"I played the computer game Pandora Directive, heard that a movie was in the making in addition to having played the prequel game in the series, Under A Killing Moon. I knew I had to read the book when I heard that it was out. I got to read about things not in the game, and believe me, it was worth it. It fleshed out the game moreso in my mind, and even made me wish the game had had some of the stuff left out! If I hadn't played the game (or seen a movie of the same title) I believe I would have come away with a strong desire to see one (if one existed) It gave me a great sense of place and character developement with an exciting adventure thrown in. Having never read Aaron Conners before, (but having seen him as an actor in the 3rd Tex Murphy and knowing that he helped in the design of the games) I got interested in reading his work. I respect him in both genres now. Thank you, Mr. Conners!"
5,Pandora leaves you wanting more!,"Wow! That is about all that I can say. It's too bad that Access decided to kill off the video game version of Tex. But, if Conners books (and he's promised three more) are as good as this one is, perhaps Tex fans can find their fix in a good Tex Murphy mysteries novel. Conners: Hurry up and write those novels! That cliffhanger in Overseer is driving us nuts!!!"
2,Works great for a month,"This product works great when new. I bought one at a local store and it worked great for a month or two. Then a small piece broke off, so I returned it to the store. The replacement worked great for a month or so as well, then the same piece broke. Also, the foil cutter breaks easily as well. I am giving up and getting a Rabbit corkscrew. The Rabbit lasted for two years before finally giving up."
2,Good while it lasts,"We have had 2 of these pans. With the first, the coating started to bubble and lift after about 2-3 years. We never used metal utensils to clean or work with this pan and always used it on low to medium heat on an electric stove. Swiss Diamond was good and replaced it. The coating on the second one started bubbling and chipping off after the same 2 to 3 year period. So at this point we're ready to try another manufacturer. It's difficult to find pans like this with lids that vent. The Swiss Diamond one does have that but the ventilation is fairly limited. To the point of you wonder whether the vent is open or closed."
1,DON'T TOUCH WITH METAL,"129.00 THIS PAN IS NO BETTER THAN THE 10.00 PAN AT WAL-MART MINE IS READY FOR THE GARBAGE ONLY USED 7 WEEKS IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS TWO YEARS OLD. THERE ARE MORE CUTS THAN YOU CAN COUNT, THEY ADVERTISE IT CAN BE USED WITH ALL UTENSILS LIE. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
2,Needlessly wordy and dull,"I went into this with great expectations, but found it flat out boring. Characters go on barely related tangents for pages at a time, giving pseudo-scientific explanations for every move they make. The original techno-babble.I can forgive the dated science, considering the age, I just can't forgive that there is barely any story, and the characters make unbelievable advances in a matter of hours.There are several sequels to this book, although I am thinking twice about tackling them."
4,Old fashioned sci-fi,"I found this book back in the 70s and had a bunch of fun reading it. Campbell wrote it in 1930. This edition is 1953. Earth gets to go to Mars and battle beings that have aircraft with multi-mile-long wings and twenty pusher style propellors on each wing. The monster ships are powered by solidified light, no less. Now before you start laughing your head off, don't forget that light is made up of particles. Theoretically, they could be brought together to form a solid substance. Now if you want to laugh at the idea of a society of martians living on Mars with the knowledge we have today, well, go ahead. The story is very original and clever. I think it would have been great as a movie. I give it four out of five stars merely in light of what we now know about our planet neighbors. It's a good ""what if"" tale, though. Get it while it's cheap and enjoy it for the pure entertainment value that ""The Black Star Passes"" is."
3,Interesting View of What the Future will hold,"Written around 1930, this futuristic Sci Fi novel introduces propeller airplanes the size of cities, invisibility devices, aliens on Venus, and chemical warfare that knocks people out and also cures cancer. This book is quite dated, but if you like silent movies for their insight into the past, you will enjoy Black Star Passes."
5,Awesome book for many ages,"This book is great! The illustrations are colorful and fun. I have been reading this book to my infant nearly daily and he loves it. He is now nearly 7 months old and he has begun to ""talk"" to the book during our reading time. I give each character a unique voice and he gets a kick out of it. It's awesome! I also know this book is a winner with young children. It's a fun book all around."
3,"Strong of Setting, Weak on Mystery","Originally published in 1965, this superbly translated mystery does a better job of displaying its 1960s Tokyo business world setting than it does of providing a satisfying mystery. For the modern American reader, the formality and attention paid to manners by the characters might seem more at place in an cozy old Agatha Christie village murder. Indeed, the importance of hierarchy and respect in Japanese culture (not to mention the role of women) is fully evoked in this tale of an industrial spy and his love life. Unfortunately, Takagi relies far too much on unlikely coincidences and relationships to resolve the multiple murders--although not quite as much as Seicho Matsumoto does in ""Inspector Imanishi Investigates."" Keen readers will, in any event, deduced the solution long before the end."
3,Average...,"Since many of Hosanna Music's earlier recordings are unavailable and this is ""vintage"" worship, I would really have liked to see some of Hosanna's older, rarer material. The Ron Kenoly tracks ""Lift Him Up"", ""Ancient of Days"", and ""Be Glorified"" are easily found elsewhere on other CD's and this CD could have done without those. Also, those tracks don't really fit the mold of that old nostalgic keyboard-led praise and worship of Hosanna Music's old albums. 85% of this CD actually contains songs that we all can find easily elsewhere. Hosanna should re-release tracks that haven't already been put on multiple other CD's."
1,inaccurate description,"This product is not at all as described. According to the product description, it's 8.8 inches long and 3 inches wide. In reality it's 6 inches long and less than half an inch wide. It also comes in one million little pieces that you have to assemble. The educational pamphlet describing each sub is quite good, but not enough to make up for how disappointing the toy is. We will be returning this item."
1,A True Waste of Time,"If it were possible to give this book a negative rating, I wouldn't hesitate to do so. What might have been a poignant, touching story, instead morphs into a rambling, unrealistic series of thoughts/feelings without any substance to speak of. I was determined to read this book, as the reviews I had read were somewhat glowing. What I found were characters without character and a plot that had gone MIA. The idea behind this book had great potential, but I found myself not caring in the least what happened to any of these superficial, immature characters. If you feel compelled to read this one, at least get it from the library. Even at amazon prices, it is extremely over-priced for what it is."
3,Maybe 2 1/2 stars?,"Ok, I read the whole book and still cannot decide if I liked it or not. It is very different. I didn't find the lack of puntuation to take totally away from the story, but it made it a bit hard to read sometimes. There would be a page and a half of Ann's rambling, disjointed thoughts all running together that got to be a bit much. And it is strange how she focused on a love affair gone bad at this critical point in her life. It appears she was never really happy because she based eveything in her life on this one event and nothing measured up. There really wasn't a conclusion, just an end. If you are looking for unusual, this may be the book for you. If you are looking for a good, solid story to get lost in, skip it."
1,Virginia Woolf Rip Off,"While Minot shoots for the stars, her abtruse prose lacks clarity and insight that is essential in the success of a literary novel. The plot and characters, which do have potential, are actually hindered by the overly precious, purple prose. Monkeys still stands as Minot's best work."
4,Descriptions of death and that special love hit home.,"If you have recently lost a parent, and sat with your family around the bed for the many days it took for their body to surrender to death, you will find yourself weeping at Minot's accurate description of death and dying. Trying to piece together the parts of your parent's life you never really knew, giggling over the effects of morphine on their speech, and trying to sort out where God is in all of this, you will relate all too easily to what is happening in this novel, and ponder what really is important in life. Those special high moments when you feel you really are in communion are what, in the end, life is all about: love."
1,Overrated,"A book pretentious people will moon over, but for my money poorly written and vastly overrated."
2,Difficult to Digest,"I really wanted to like this book, but I was hindered by the author's writing style. Without any warning, I would have read a page before I realized I had stumbled upon one of Ann Grant's memories from the past. Even though Ann suffered from a terrible illness, I had no compassion for this character or her life. My mind wandered a lot while trying to read this book. The book was not interesting to me at all."
4,worth reading,"I liked this book. It was a quick read, which is refreshing, because most of the books I pick up are huge and, at times, overwhelming. This book was a snapshot of a life. The author played with words and sounds in the text, in a way that was different and that truly created a mood. At times it was almost like poetry. If you're looking for a perfect love story, don't read this. The characters are full of flaws, and you may even be disenchanted at times. I was, and it verged on disappointment, but it was real and, for the most part, they remained sympathetic. What this story does is make you think about your life and forces you to think about choices you make. Life should not be about regret."
4,"Terrific, haunting book on identity","Though it doesn't hold up with consistency throughout, Evening is still one of the best books to come out in a long time. Minot doesn't tell the reader how to read or what exactly to glean from this tale, but that is the point. Through the scraps of memory, the narrator builds her life, identifying with unexpected moments and people from her past. The great love she has clung to is ultimately, not what she lived for, and in a stunning section toward the end of her life, she realizes that despite the false values and dreams she chose to sustain herself where not the true driving forces behind her choices in life, that she did indeed, for better or worse, live her life to be true to her own self, to her own heart."
3,Enhhh.....,"No doubt Minot is a good writer. But this story just doesn't satisfy. Maybe I'm just not a sophisticated enough reader to get it (actually, I am) or maybe there isn't much to get. My first clue that this wasn't working for me was the totally one-sided sexual experience Anne had with Arden on the first night. Yuck! If this is the love of your life shouldn't he be a less selfish lover? Too many loose ends, too hard to sink my teeth into."
4,Flowing and literary,Beautiful writing. A fluid stream of consciousness. Memories of momentous and fleeting love. Haunting.
2,The Evening-Difficult to follow,I found the book to be very hard to follow. The disjointedness was just too hard to follow with all of the characters and husbands. I am one to always finish a book that I start but this one just about did me in. Would not recommend it.
1,A bad investment of my time....,"Working all week and finding no paycheck on payday is how I would describe my experience reading this book. It never delivered. I enjoy beautiful and descriptive writing but you can't use it to hide poorly developed characters and an inferior plot. Other reviewers were right, reading this was a chore. I reached the last page having gained nothing."
2,"""misunderstanding of the real manner"".","When I read this book I was really surprised that Susan Minot didn't get to her point and did not deliver the message of it. The book is cheap in the sense of money, but's worth less than the seven dollars I payed for it. I do not intend to be cruel with Ms. Minot but I would recommend a classic instead"
4,I actually found it interesting....,i do have to say that i actually enjoyed this book. it was perfectly written and was beautiful. her life was not all that perfect and to tell you the truth i know several friends who have those lifetstyles so it isn't that far from the ordinary...
2,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"Although Susan Minot attempts to weave a spell with her sophisticated use of language, the emptiness of her often interchangeable characters undercuts her ambition. This is the story of Ann Lord: a boring, shallow woman who has yet to outgrow her twenty-five year old self. Although she is sixty-five years old, on her deathbed, and drifting in and out of a delirium of morphine-induced memory, she seems to have learned nothing of the power of enduring love. Her children, her three husbands, are of minor importance compared to the power of a single weekend of great sex with a deceitful womanizer. I do not understand what I am supposed to take away from this novel. It is impossible to form an attachment to any character, because the prose is all surface glitter. I believe that most great books take their strength from the power of love, which is absent from this novel."
2,I just don't get it,"I'm with the huh? people - I just don't understand why this got good reviews. The writing is so bad that I can't get past the 2nd page. ""The person had a deep voice which came from somewhere deep in his chest"" - is this supposed to reinforce the fact that his voice was REALLY deep? Or could the author just not find a thesaurus? Some sentences go on and on, free of any punctuation, and some are three words long. How can anyone read this? And who holds books ""loosely"", anyway? Surprise she didn't drop it. A ""contraption with a bad wheel""? Hello, it's called a cart. As I said, I just don't get it."
4,Flawed but powerful,"Took me a while to get the rythmn of this book. While I at first found much of the stream-of-consciousness writing labored and self-conscious, I appreciated what she was trying to accomplish. Takes courage to try something different. I often grew impatient with the delayed Harris/Ann story, spread out across too many pages.But the last third made me a believer in this writer, whose prose takes on real power when she gets to the meat that drove her to this book. Gutsy stuff written with tremendous insight and heart. It's flawed, yeah, but its sustained power and final tour de force made it well worth the ride. Rock on, Minot. A beautiful book. Turn that power to another."
2,Disappointing and Tiresome,"I had such a hard time reading Evening. The premise fascinated me, but I just found it dull. I didn't so much mind the shifts in tense, but at times the story got so jumbled that I had a hard time keeping the characters and the time periods straight. I had heard such great things about this book, but in the end, I was simply disappointed."
2,Frustrating,"I attempted to read this book, but had to abandon ship three quarters of the way through. The author has a lot of flashbacks and her punctuation is really confusing. The main character Ann appears to be on her deathbed and is having flasbacks of a life with regrets. Ann had three marriages and she stews about these marriages but for me I had a hard time piecing together which husband came in what order, not to mention the admirers along the way. What was annoying about this book were the intermittent italicized sentences with no punction that seemed to run on, and trail off into space. I am an avid reader, and I usually eat up books fast, but this one was painstakingly frustrating to finish so I didn't."
2,Boring and Lame,"I buy 95% of my books online from Amazon and much of the time based on reader reviews, which is how I decided on Evening. What did I miss?? I was extremely disappointed in this book. The ""images"" Ann saw from her medicated state included dinosaurs, aspargus, syringes, martini glasses, Chinese men, etc, etc. Sometimes I would have to read an entire page to determine ""where"" Ann was in her life and the pages without punctuation were horrible to read. The memories of the wedding-weekend 40 years ago were the most enjoyable and was similar to Bridges of Madison County only more slow and boring. I did finish it and was glad when I was done. Like I said, Boring and Lame."
5,hypnotic ....,Susan Minot is one of the most gifted writers. I must read it again! Minot's senses are keen. She gives us back what we may have forgotten! This book will remain on my shelf for many years to come.
2,Air Poetry,"Susan Minot has a fine command of the English language, but she wastes it on this story. Her prose has been compared to poetry; in the absence of a compelling story and sympathetic characters, her writing is precious and pretentious. I had difficulty developing a feeling for the main character, Ann, with whose impending death we are expected to sympathize. The unraveling of her tale, centering on a weekend love affair many years before, is a protracted tease that ultimately amounts to little more than air."
3,Where are the Quotation Marks?,"In my copy there are no quotation marks. Some people I spoke to said it's a new ""minimalist"" trend that to me, if true, is disturbing. I wrote the publisher about it and am waiting for a response. (Was it done on purpose or was it some sort of error?) At any rate, Lynne Truss (""Eats Shoots & Leaves) would have a heart attack."
2,Irritating to read,"It had potential to be a good book given the storyline, but where are the punctuation marks? I know the author was trying to establish a certain lyricism, but I think one can accomplish that with quotation marks. I had to read lines over and over, particularly after a long day at work. Additionally, it was ""cut up."" I personally do not enjoy books that shift from past to present throughout the entire book. Not a satisfying read for those wanting a smooth ride."
3,"Poetic, evocative women's story.","I enjoy Minot's writing. The book goes very quickly with occasional necessary moments to reorient oneself. The story is a bit melodramatic but a suspenseful one. I have trouble with the fact that Ann Lord is ""old."" Sixty five is not old by today's standards and that was a constant bit of grating in the other- wise colloquial writing that rang quite true. The story concerns a long-ago wedding which is interspersed with the main plot of Ann's dying. A tragic event takes place and we see it done as an anatomy as we see the disintegration of Ann Lord's own anatomy. I do not see this novel as intriguing for men but I could be wrong."
2,A total disappointment,"The author's style of writing, 5 sentences run together without punctuation, is so annoying I had to reread each sentence to understand what she was saying. You will never really get to know the characters as its like looking at it through a window, not experiencing it."
4,A simple plot made intricate by beautiful & clever delivery,"A particularly moving novel that is brilliantly written. The slow demise of Ann's health and mind is aptly depicted in the structure. As the book progresses the confusion intensifies which parallels Ann's increasing confusion of her own thoughts as she tries to differentiate the present from her memories. The frustration felt by the reader trying to sort out what is going on at times helps us empathise with Ann and her frustration of what her illness was doing to her mind. The author briefly jumps from one time and place to another with Ann as she recalls her life through a progression of flashing detail. Only the memory of her one true love were clear and precise. The novel raises the issue of lost opportunities, and the ""second bests"" that are ""accepted"" in its place. Loved it. Thought it was brilliantly and beautifully written. My only question is: Who was John Winters with the animal heart? Did I miss something?"
2,what's all the fuss about?,"Minot begins her novel well but seems to mishandle a number of the themes throughout. She allows cliche to rule the overall theme. There is a rushed or thoughtless quality to a number of important passages where her author's hand disturbs, if you will, the surface of the water into which we peer. At times her assertions undercut the events and weaken the prose and narrative.While I can see Minot has talent, I am left wondering why so many critics (in published reviews) have gone gaw-gaw over her stylistic ability. I think that is her greatest weakness- the plot is strong, the story and characters interesting, but her writing is without clarity, focus, and true insight.I judge her so harshly only because she has clearly attempted to write in a literary and timeless vein- it is my opinion that so far she has yet to fulfill the glittering praise she has harvested and this book will not stand the test of time."
2,Disappointed in the book...but LOVE the movie.,"I recently saw the movie ""Evening"" on tv and loved so I ordered the dvd from Amazon. Then I decided I'd buy the book to see all the movie left out. I had a hard time even getting interested in this book. I will stick with the movie version instead. I will donate the book to the used bookstore in my area.The movie is WONDERFUL."
3,lukewarm,"did not fulfill the initial expectations; the potential of the plot wasn't fully explored and the emotions were somehow ""in medium range""... never too high."
2,Evening the book,"Saw the movie first, and loved the movie. Book is very different, and a bit disappointing. Adds little depth to the story or characters, which is what I would have expected from the book, even if it is very different than the movie. I don't think I would have liked the book even if I never saw the movie. Too many characters and an empty ending, just the rambling thoughts of a dying woman. First time ever that I liked the movie more than the book. However, with Claire Dane, Hugh Dancy, Vanessa Redgrave, Mamie Mummer, Natasha Richardson, & Meryl Streep, it would be pretty hard to come out with a bad movie!"
1,"Tedious, attenuated tale based on romantic cliche","Minot lumbers her way through present and past, teasing out the wedding weekend exasperatingly. I was skimming the sick room scenes, then even the scenes of the past. I kept thinking ""Bridges of Madison County,"" except here it was three days instead of four. Plus, if you want to be lauded for aesthetic sensibilities, surely you, or your editor, ought to get some rudimentary grammar right--the right verb forms for lay and lie, using ground, rather than grinded for the past tense of ground, and a million alright misuses. It's ALL RIGHT. These pesky irritants were like mosquitoes swarming over an already unsavory bog."
2,Bookjacket was misleading,"From the bookjacket I was sure I would find this book an interesting and enjoyable read. However, I never seemed to be able to become engrossed in the novel-which for me is a sign of a first-rate book. Most importantly, the main character, Ann Lord, never came alive for me and I couldn't connect to her and thus didn't feel anything for her as she reflected on her past and during her current battle with a terminal illness. Also, I found the writing style and form to be confusing. There was too much jumping around between past and present in the chapters causing me to have to stop reading and figure out if Ann was in the past or present."
3,What is happening to Susan Minot?,"The writing is becoming too pretentious; I am constantly aware now of the writer's hand in all this. MONKEYS remains a classic for me, elegant and sad and true, but since then, imitation, self-consciousness and ego."
1,Stunk it up,"The ending in the book was very disappointing. The chapters rambled on, the character is confused by medication. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I'm gonna try to sell it on the bulletin board at work. I'm not even putting it back on my bookshelf!"
2,Eveing (MTI) Vintage Comtemporaries,I saw the movie trailer for this book and also a recommendation from a woman's magazine that this would be a 20 hankie book. I love a good emotional book so I bought it. What a complete waste of time. The words (or thoughts) of the main character in this book were all jumbled together and it made no sense. I did NOT enjoy this book. It was a chore to just get it read. I certainly hope the movie is better. Don't bother with this book. I don't recommend it at all. It jumps around from time period to time period and keeps you confused.
3,A bit pretentious...not enough payoff,"The novel isn't BAD, but neither is it GOOD. A large number of readers will swoon over the style and mistake it for substance. I'd give the style 3 1/2 stars (Minot isn't in enough control of her imagery or pacing to merit more; her vocabulary is mostly unremarkable), the substance 2 1/2 stars--I'd give it less, except that one could make an argument that Minot is using the ""love affair"" of the wedding weekend as an indication of the kind of choices Ann, the main character, makes throughout her life. You could definitely see Ann as someone who mistakes chemistry for character (even she has a problem with style over substance)."
4,left waiting,"I loved Minot's style and felt that she conveyed the conflict between conscious/subconscious or mind/heart very well. I grew attached to each of her characters but was left waiting for more closure by the end of the book. Minot did not clarify the answers to the questions she asked at the opening: Do moments last forever? Does the love matter? It did not seem that the author meant to leave problems unresolved, but simply lost the energy to finish what she started. The issues of the sisters and brother, with their mother, each other, and their own personal lives, had no conclusion. I was left wondering if Minot wanted to reader to believe that endless cycles exist in human nature, and this was reflected in Ann's problems continued on with her children. What was the connection between Ann and Constance? Why did Maria write Ann? Well written and a basically enjoyable plot line, QUICK READ, but please explain more!"
2,"Lyrical prose, shallow characters, ultimately disappointing","""Evening"" was tantalizing and sensual, but ultimately disappointing. Susan Minot's lyrical style seems to capture how I would imagine the experience of dying slowly. Yet the plot and characters were too thin for the novel to take hold. The minor characters--Ann's children and her friends of 40 years ago--were cardboard and interchangeable. In fact, I felt no sorrow when Ann died, because she was shallow, caring little for her children, untouched by the experience of motherhood, and having no other accomplishments to speak of. Harris, the love of her life with nothing more than good looks to offer, seems undeserving of Ann's extraordinary deathbed passion."
3,Disappointing,"I wouldn't say this book was horrible. I admit I read it very quickly. But, it failed by a long shot to live up to some of the glowing reviews it received. Character development is pretty minimal. The characters are all pretty interchangable. And the story itself is rather undeveloped. Some might argue that was intentional, part of the book's style. I'd argue the author used a style, which often shifts into free-verse poetry, to avoid the hard work of writing a better book. I mean, even the most cold-hearted person I think would give more thought to her son's premature death as she lies on her own deathbed. Minot tries to show the subtle emotional lives of rich waspy types who appear cold on the surface. But she ends up making them look rather cold to the core."
2,Poor quality,I just bought this item and was very disappointed with it. It is put together so sloppily. Uneven and poorly fitting seams really surprised me. I never purchased a RCA product before and I guess I won't ever again. There is also no output jacks to connect with other electronics or additional speakers. It just was not a quality product. I guess I'll go back to AIWA or Sony. You get what you pay for.
1,RCA RS1289 Compact stereo system sucks!,"i have this product and the cd player broke on it! after the first1 1/2 year! my aunt also has this product and on hers the buttons dont work if u push CD it plays the radio its all skrewed up DONT BUY THIS!!!! buy something by phillips or sony they've never let me down truly yours, me"
5,Great System,This is an great system. i have had it for 3 months and i love it. it does not skip like others say. i say anyone looking for a 5 cd player buy this one.
4,"Not that good of a movie, but..",".. The scene where the Eater's Club comes into the restaurant and eats out the entire restaurant of food, so, the trainees put laxative into strawberry milkshakes.. so the Eater's Club drinks them and in seconds they begin passing gas. With quotes like ""Deep and Mean"" and ""Aroma"" this is the funniest part of the whole movie because they all rush to the bathroom to were an oriental tourist takes their picture and you hear a heavy set woman say ""No Flash, No Flash!"" the building then goes: Ka-Boom! Funny stuff, worth this part, even if you hate the rest of the movie."
3,Kinda Funny!!!,"I have owned this movie for about 6 years and never got around to reviewing it. I love the beginning montage with showing all the different burger joints, grilling the burgers, and people eating them. Somewhere in the middle of the movie, I just lose interest. This movie reminds me of Police Academy. Toward the end, I like it again when the group go to work at the Buster Burger restaurant and bikers, police men, and obese people come and mess up the place. If you love 80's comedies, you'll probably like HAMBURGER: THE MOTION PICTURE!!!"
1,Booger sure can pick em',"Its not surprising that a movie that is filled with fart jokes and booger talk would appeal to a guy named Booger. This movie will be highly enjoyed by anyone with an IQ that equates to the number of states that seceded from the Union. I can just see Booger now, watching this on his out of date VCR in his mommy's basement, Confederate flag on the wall, stacks of Swank and Hustler littering the floor..."
1,Unwatchable,"I thought this was the greatest movie I had ever saw- when I was 10. Seeing it again fifteen years later, I didn't laugh once. Filled with annoying characters, unbelievable dialogue, and ludicrous stereotypes, makes this forgettable movie a bomb. This is from the days where 30-year-olds try to play 17 and 18-year-olds. It's too slapstick, too looney-tunes. Don't expect a DVD transfer."
5,BUSTERBURGER UNIVERSITY,"THIS MOVIE IS A TRUE AMERICAN CLASSIC,HOW COULD IT BE DISCONTINUED,IT SHOULD BE RERLEASED ON DVD,TRIED TO FIND IT,EXTERMELY DIFFICULT,BUT I ALREADY HAD IT ON TAPE,EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE A COPY OF THIS FILM,I HAVE SEEN THIS FLICK ATLEAST 50 TIMES"
4,"""I Love Eating Out!""","Two reasons to watch this movie-the hot brunette British psychologist at the beginning and the scene where the guy is eating out the hot Randi Brooks under the table at the Chinese restaraunt. Watching her sweat and squirm as she builds up to a volcanic orgasm that makes Meg Ryan in ""When Harry Met Sally"" look like a Girl Scout made this whole movie for me. I wish they would release this movie on DVD so I could jump to these two fravorite scenes instead of constantly rewinding and fast-forwarding with my VHS edition."
3,YOU HAD TO BE THERE,"WELCOME TO LA FENICE IN VENICE, WHERE ERNANI RISES LIKE A PHOENIX FROM THEGNARLED ASHES OF DEL MONACO'S BULLYING VOICE--AT LEAST HE DOESN'T SOUNDWIMPY LIKE TODAY'S TENOR'S DO. THE SOPRANO, BARITONE, BASS, CHORUS ANDORCHESTRA ARE FINE AS IS THE RECORDING. HOWEVER, LOOK FOR FRANCO CORELLI'SERNANI FROM THE 1060'S TO HEAR HOW THIS SHOULD BE DONE. OF COURSE, THETOUCHSTONE REMAINS THE RCA ERNANI WITH BERGONZI AND PRICE---EVVIVA!"
2,American History - additional information for youngsters,"This book was very good for showing my grandchildren what life was like ""back then"". Not as good a book as I was expecting, however, still managed to stimulate discussion about how come there wasn't any electricity - therefore no computers, light, ipods, etc. Grandaughter (9) and grandson (4) did not return to this book as much as others in the series of ""What was it like when ..... "". However, it was still a learning event in a fun way."
4,Great for the price,I have this dinnerware including serving pieces and bakeware in my home. This is a wonderful line of dinnerware which for the low price simply can't be beat. One reviewer points out that there are black circular marks in the color glazing. This is the antiquing on the plate which is normal. Dinner pieces such as plates and bowls are dishwasher and microwave safe. Bakeware such as casseroles are oven safe.
2,poor in quality,"I just recently bought this watch. First thing I noticed, was that by pressing start/stop button, it makes the seconds indicator to jump forward. Extremely annoying feature. Next, the date indicator stuck between the 6th and 7th day. Very disappointed, since with this price you should expect better quality. Or even the same as in cheap watches. Definitely a No-Go."
1,It takes only one watch breakdown to shatter the image,"I'm sorry to say my fascination with Longines watches quality is over. My Longines broke down in its second year and after going through the trouble of sending it over to Geneva for repair it broke down again after only 6 months of use. I do not lead an overly active lifestyle or subject the watch to harsh conditions. Now I'm working on throwing (read: shipping) it back one way with a ""thanks, but no thanks!"" note. I only wish I'd bought it through Amazon, that would have made the return much easier."
1,Thin metal,My 4 year old son could easily bend this ladle. I can't believe a company made this and feels good about itself.
1,Major Difficulties,"I had purchased this for myself last christmas and was super excited because I have always wanted to play. I receive it, and the box is all torn up (it was a super thin box) and there was hardly any padding inside. I pull it out and discover that many of the bridges were broken and that the base frame was as well. When trying to replace it, they said they were out and did not know when they would be available. PLUS i had ordered the set with a bag and a how to play book. The bag and book never arrived, even though the company said they were in a different shipment.I would suggest if you are interested to look up on google, dulcimer makers in your area and get one direct, they are normally decently priced and willing to work with you."
4,Alex Rudy,"The music video is mindblowing. It's traditional some girls. but sounds better than the earlier stuff. Man, they are fun."
1,Incomplete and repetitive. Not enough to pass the test.,"I passed 5 other exams using only the Microsoft Trainig Kits, but I have failed the Exchange Server test twice. This book is far from complete, there are topics in the tests that are not mentioned on the book. To make things worse, some topics are repeated over and over. It seems that a different person has written each chapter, but they forgot to revise how the chapters would fit together (remember the Hubble mirrors fiasco?)."
1,this book could kill Bill Gates' interest in Exchange,"I wasted some time reading this repetitious and wordy book. I could skim for pages to glean a few sentences of substance. Paragraph upon paragraph of information without illustrations. It took me a couple of months before I could pick up Mitch Tulloch's ES5.5 book, which was great."
2,Bubbles are Nice and relaxing.,"The bubbles are nice and since my husband and I are both fans of Jacuzzi's and I have a bad back, he decided to get one for me to use until a Jacuzzi can be built. However, I have a real problem with the suction cups holding to the bottom of my bath tub and have tried everything to get some of them to stick. I have asked the customer service department about the problem and they have been very good to respond and sugested that maybe I had a non-shid bathtub and that is why it would not stick. That is not the case and I find that the mat floats in the tub better than I do. But, it is soothing and will work out until the real thing is finished."
4,Nice and relaxing,"I think that the noise is not to loud. Sure it might bug some but I find it vary relaxing when I am trying to tone out the noise my 3 children, husband and 2 cats make. The bubbles are actually relaxing and pretty strong. It really feels good when your muscles are sore. Just keep in mind you must lay the mat down before you fill the tub or it will not stick to the tub. And you can not use it if your tub is textured. I wish I had more time to relax and take a bath with my new bubble mat."
4,definitely worth your while,"A very good book. Grusa writes with a very Czech sense of humor and combines it with a Grassian sense of magic. Although I'll try to avoid plot summary, a little is necessary: the protagonist, in his search for a job, is required to fill out a questionnaire with explicit instructions to not leave anything out. With these orders in mind, he then tells the history of his family from the beginning. This is typical of the Czech means of resistance to whatever oppression they face, and you can see it in Hasek's ""The Good Soldier Svejk"" and Hrabal's ""Closely Watched Trains."" Overall, it's funny, magical, epic (in its own way) and a lot of fun to read. As I said before, it's definitely worth your while."
3,Outdated,"Offers some excellent tips for selling but does not update on how much help the internet can be as well as the 2008 housing crash. She talks like ""do this"" and your house will sell quickly."
1,Conflicting information; incomplete; poor grammar -- very bad!,"This book appears to have been thrown together quickly in order to satisfy a market niche. First and foremost, it is lacking in detail. There's no way you can take what you ""learn"" in this book and then immediately sell your home FSBO. You need a lot more information on closing, home inspection, and numerous other issues on which this book barely touches. Furthermore, the formatting of the book, which highlights the opinions of ""experts,"" is often contradictory without any insight into or explanation of the contrary opinions. Rather, mutually exclusive opinions (and facts!) are presented side-by-side. Finally, there are tons of typos and grammatical errors in this book -- which is predominantly fluff, any way. The type face is large and the book is thin. Although there isn't a lot of material to be found on selling FSBO (for obvious reasons), would-be FSBO sellers would be smart to continue their searches rather than stopping here."
4,"Great book, but not everyone participated","I was really excited when I received this book. It has some beautiful pictures that make it very special. One thing that I thought might be a problem was that there were only spaces for 130 messages/signatures. Planning for 300 guests had me concerned about room for all their signatures, but not everyone took the time to write a message. There got to be a line out the church b/c it was taking too long for people to write a message. I love the book, but would recommend it for smaller weddings...so there isn't a long line to get in and sit down!"
5,"Hard to find, perfect replacement flap for our old pet door","I searched at length for a replacement flap for our old pet door to no avail. It seems that the newer doors have different dimensions than our old one (from '95). I never thought to look on Amazon but am glad I did because I found the exact replacement for my pet door which had been discontinued.Installation was pretty easy, but make sure you have it facing the right way. It is a little confusing because it seems at first it should go the wrong way. The directions that come with it are not very helpful. I would suggest taking a picture of the old one, front and back, before you take it off, that will help when you install the new one."
1,"Petco repeated advertises items they do not have. In response to this add for ""only 18","Petco repeatedly advertises items that THEY DO NOT HAVE! I found the perfect replacement dog door flap but I wanted to double check before buying as the pictured door was the right one but there were no dimensions. I went to the ""sellers"" phone number, only to be told ""Oh, we don't have the one pictured, only other models which I'm sure will work for you"". Before shopping Amazon at the suggestion of PetSafe who no longer makes the door, I called and visited several PetCo stores only to be told when I got there that they no longer carried that door. As I said I CALLED BEFORE DRIVING MILES TO BE SURE THEY HAD WHAT I NEED.The false advertising is bad enough. The direct lie approach stinks."
1,Cheap,"You probably can't find a cheaper air nibbler. This one is pretty roughly finished, as expected. I broke it before I could really get it going.I was able to cut 20 gauge steel for about 1"" before the bottom of the nibbler head snapped off. I think the nibbler head is made from the wrong material for the kind of toughness needed.I didn't get any work done with this thing."
3,Description misleading.,These jumper cables seem to be decent quality but the wire is NOT 6 gauge. It is 8 gauge at best with really thick insulation.
1,Misleading product description,"The cable looks nice but does not work for my SUV. I need a 6-gauge cable to jump start. This is not really 6-gauge, like other reviewer said, 8-gauge at best, maybe 10-gauge. If you need a 6-gauge cable, don't buy this one."
2,Metabolic Support....,I did not notice any real change in my Metabolism. I am diabetic and was hoping for a change. No Results. Will not purchase again
5,Helps keep glucose under control,I've taken this product for several years and it's helped lower my blood glucose levels substantially. It does what it's suppose to do.

The album kicks off with ""Love in a Vacuum,"" with its bass guitar intro; a good song. ""No More Crying"" is also a good tune along with the cool song ""Winning the War."" The guitar playing at the beginning of that song is cool. A good album."
5,'Til Tuesday Stops Time With Voices Carry,"I not only wore out my first cassette of ""Voices Carry,"" I damn near burned a hole in my CD from listening to it so much! This album is a rare find for an 80's pop collection that literally stands in a class all its own. A masterpiece all the way and a nostalgic journey for a kid that grew up in the 80s."
4,heavy hitting vocals and lyrics,"i listened to this album over and over in college until i practically wore the cassette out. songs about relationships and heartache, the game of love. this is absolutely a pop album, but lacks the silliness of most 80's pop...which is a good thing in my book.even if the lyrics aren't up your alley, Aimee Mann's voice should be."
2,Rather small.,"The Topaz earring is nice enough and probably worth $45, but be aware that it is smaller than it looks on the web page. The shaft that hangs between the two stones is about 5/16"" long; the larger stone is about 3/16"" wide and 1/4"" high; the small stone is about 3/32"" wide. Essentially, you get what you pay for."
1,microscopic,can't imagine what type of camera lens they used to represent this product because it is small.Too small to match the amber pendant I bought that I thought would match. Absolutly microscopic.
2,cheap jewellery,"not good - cheap and nasty, bought as a present, but will not give them because they are cheap looking"
3,Not like picture,"The color of the gems is fine but from the picture, thought the posts would be longer than they are. Maybe my expectations were too high considering the price paid."
2,too small.,The picture is very misleading. The items are much smaller that the picture leads you to believe. I do like the earrings but I believe the price is too high for the quality of the item.
1,the photo is mis leading,"the product is very very small and the photo and description leads you to believe that it is larger. it was a christmas gift but i could not give it, no way. i better ask for measurements next time.The delivery time was good."
4,Blue Topaz Earrings,The earrings arrived in a timely manner for Valentine's. Appear a little smaller than I had assumed. Look very good and dazzle just enough to make someone happy.Priced right.
4,14k Yellow Gold Amethyst Drop Earrings,"Product as describe, but it's small. Good packed and fast shipping. Strongly recommend this seller!"
3,Good quality but small and pricy,The product is as advertised but is smaller than the pictures suggest. This may be a bit over-priced.
1,RIP OFF,I bought this as a gift on 18th December 2008 and they charged me 64.99. On Dec 19th 2008 the price was 39.99. I wouldnt buy anything from these rip offs again.
2,Dainty and broken,"Gave these as a gift and the recipient was surprised at how ""dainty"" they were. More importantly, they arrived broken, so she returned them and received credit because they were no longer in stock. I see that they are now available, but would not order them again because of the description I received from the recipient. She did love my 5x7mm swiss blue topaz earrings in white gold so I thought these would be an even more beautiful and elegant gift. I was wrong and wish I'd sent her the same as mine."
3,Too small-but I did not check dimensions,"I returned the earrings. They were much smaller than they appeared, but I did not check dimensions in the description, so this is really my fault. Otherwise, delivery was quick and no problem with the return."
2,Unpleasant Suprise,"Very small, the second I saw the box and packaging I was disappointed. I planned to give them to my wife but they are to small, but the design is to mature for my 11 year old."
2,Smaller than it seems,"Pros: The metal seems to be be true as described as ""14K Yellow gold."" The pouch that it came with was cute and appropriate for the product. The product was delivered on time as it was promised.Cons: The gemstone (garnet), though small, lacks the luster as other garnet gemstone would look like.It is also smaller than I expected for the the price it was listed (please see picture with a pen cap adjacent to it). The box that it came with was crushed. So disappointed with the packaging."
3,disappointed in product,"I was very disappointed in this set of earrings. On the pictures,these looked beautiful. However, in actuality, they are VERY smalland short. They are only about 1/2 inch long.I had planned on purchasing other stones in this same style, butnow I will not."
2,Really tiny earrings!,"I had read reviews discussing how tiny these earrings are, but was still surprised when I opened them. I would almost say the size is more appropriate for a child, but the design would not be appropriate for a child. They are made well, pretty, but know that these are really tiny earrings."
5,I love them!,"These earrings are dainty and cute. If you are looking for something bold and striking, I would not recommend them. They are about 20mm in the length, fairly small. The amethysts are a beautiful color and look perfect with the 14k gold. I bought these as a gift for my mom and I think they are a steal for under $40."
4,nice for the price.,thought these would be just bit bigger but i was not mad about that. The only thing bad about them was they look kind of cheap if you dont get them polished you would think tey would have that done before sending it to you but my g/f is happy with them and for 20$ i think i got a goood deal.
5,stunning beautiful.,"December, blue topaz,beautiful, drop earrings,I wore them for Christmas & got many coments on how beautiful they are. I love them, I will get more of them, they are beautiful.."
4,good value,"A good deal for the price. If you like the color, these are nice earrings. She'll like them."
3,Value for money,"These are nice earrings that are a good value for the money. They are very cute and a decent size, the only thing holding them back is gold coated."
3,Leia Monkey Face! - A Collector's Piece,"Well... i see is not so easy to just see and buy some SW items...Some ppl realized that this current figure is not exactly a nice Leia rendition... not by far. This one was called ""Leia Monkey Face"" back in the mid 90's; and still today some collectors try to get one bcoz the figure was so horrible that was worthy of being a collector's choice."
2,Princess Leah Doll,I brought the toy for my daughter to be able to play with my son. I was disappointed at the look of the character; it looked nothing like the actress. Little girls want the dolls (action figure) to at least resemble the character in the movie; this doll looked like a man.
4,Good Accessory for Atrophotography,"I get a good focus manually, but find this device to be helpful in gaining a finer focus for astrophotography. It is easy to install and intuitive to work."
3,Not a bad little rig,"If your a weekend fisherman, then this will do fine. If you're a heavy user of fishing gear, then you might want to step it up a bit."
2,"Rod is great, reel not so much....","The rod is very good but the reel stinks,Never worked not once, all tangled up. Not fun for kids on vacation. Went to local bait shop and picked up two higher quality reels the kids used all summer long with no problems. I usually swear by Zebco for kids reels but there were not good."
1,Misleading,"The ad was misleading... you don't get a 5'6 rod. You only get the bottom half of the rod and the reel. I gave it one star because the reel is good. We couldn't find anyone locally that can provide just the top half of the rod, even BIG 5 and Outdoor World and a mom and pop shop. I had to buy my son a whole new rod from the local mom and pop shop just transfer the reel. Dissapointing."
1,Waste of $$$,I bought this to replace a small Barbie pole for my daughter thinking it would be something cheep that she could use when she felt like fishing with me. The reel is cheep and doesn't allow my daughter to cast her line. The only way to fish with this pole is to drop the weight straight down off the boat and use your other hand to pull out the line. Sometimes the handle doesn't engage the lock and you have to fidget with the reel to get the lock to lock the line. I wouldn't recommend this pole to anyone unless you plan on changing the reel and just keeping the pole.
1,Worst piece of Fishing equipment ever,"All I have to say is when I purchased this rod and reel combo, the reel came tangled already before I even used it!!! I dont care if this was 1 cent, why purchase something from a company who thinks its good business practice to sell something that does not work before it is even unpackaged. Just plain awful."
2,A rushed book lacking in many areas...,"This book was obviously written in a hurry - that I can forgive, but it's also shoddily organized, and the index is absolutely horrible. Since it's the only reference currently available, it's the only show in town. That doesn't forgive the lack of finish and quality on this title."
2,Heavy on networking,"The book is extremely extensive on networking, and would appeal to a systems manager at a company who wanted a ""basic-to-medium"" level depth in knowledge of just about all of Windows 98. You will not be a computer tech with this book, but you'll sure know a lot of neat things about windows 98. In my opinion, they should have divided the book into one for networking, and one for those who just need it for troubleshooting pc's. And then in each book, provide a ""medium and advanced"" depth in knowledge on each subject. Here, one who just troubleshoots pc's will pay alot for a little information, some of which may be valuable, but otherwise, it may lack the depth required in some necessary information. Why didn't Uncle Billy do this? Why, to keep his phone techs employed!"
4,Secrets of the Dead: China's Terracotta Warrior,"There is so much to learn about China's first emperor! what was interesting to me was the new discovery found in the Purplish Blue color patina, a superior super conductor property! Well done and informative, most of all inspiring achievement.uchalik"
4,"Hey Amazon, ever heard of a SPOILER ALERT?","Season 5 ends with a dramatic cliffhanger, so I'm sure everyone watching this series on Amazon REALLY appreciates your TOTALLY ruining the suspense with the helpful phrase: ""dealing with George's death"" right there in the description of Season 6.C'mon, Amazon. Get your act together!"
2,Spoilers in Episodes Titles VERY annoying,"I am writing this based on having read the description for episode 1. I haven't finished watching Season 5 yet, but was considering purchasing Season 6 which is why I ended up on this page. Learning about George's death has really spoiled the remainder of that season 5 for me. I live in an isolated location where I very happily don't see any trailers or other television that would have made me aware of the content of this episode. Couldn't they be more sensitive to viewers by having less ""hit you on the head"" descriptions???"
2,one bad disc,ive ordered quite a few seasons of greys now and they always come in great condition but when this one showed up the box that holds the discs was damaged. i thought nothing of it and watched the first four discs. when i put the fifth disc in it would not play. i look at the disc and theres four deep scratches on it. my discs stay in the container so it wasnt me who scratched it meaning it came like that. i now have to order another set of season six just to watch four episodes because they screwed me. definitely wont take the chance of that again. im going to walmart.
5,Grey's Anatomy,Product was received quickly and in excellent shape as described. I would recommend buying product through here.
5,Season 6,"Season 6 maintains the same high standard we have become accustomed to in Greys Anatomy, with the addition of a few new characters. Despite the medical inaccuracies and increasing tendency of the docs to discuss their personal lives over an open patient on the operating table while scrubbed, the storylines themselves are addictive. The explosive finale will leave you asking - why didn't Bailey just use the stairs? Can't wait for Season 7!"
4,Good Experience,"Product arrived looking a tad beat up on the outside, but all disks were in perfect condition. Took a little longer to receive order than I was hoping, but still arrived within a reasonable amount of time."
5,Grey's Anatomy 6,This is the best season yet...The cliff hanger has me waiting on the edge of my seat for the next season to begin! WOW!
5,Excellent,The episodes in this season are some of the best. And the drama of greys is never dull and always progressing.
5,Love it!,I love this show and this season is one of my favorites because of the amazing finale I can't wait for the new season!
5,great show,i love this show and have seen all the seasons and this one will have you in tears by the last episode
5,The drama gets serious,"This season really got into more serious subjects. The characters had real issues to deal with. Although I like all the seasons to some degree, some of them have far to much whining in them over pretty menial problems.In this season, the pressures on the Doctors actually feels real. This is the darkest season, but the show has shown it can grow with this season."
1,Love Grey's but the dvd collection I bought didn't work,"Te collection arrived in good time and I was happy to get to watch the whole 6'th season. But then disappointed, because my computer didn't play any of the cd's. I tried them in a dvd player too, but still not working. A month later I bought a new set, twice the price but at least this one worked. Grey's Anatomy rocks!"
4,For those who travel and can't catch their favorite shows..this is a wonderful option,"I love the television series but have not been able to see the weekly episodes given my travels. This is the perfect gift for anyone who would like to have their ""TV fix"" while they travel! Highly recommend!"
5,Teena's best pop sounds!!!!!!!!,"Teena explodes with this album inot the realm of pop! ""Lovergirl"", ""Jammin"", and ""Out on a Limb"" make this CD shine! Teena makes the best tribute to Marvin Gaye with ""My Dear Mr. Gaye""- a play on his own album ""Here My Dear""- this album sounds like it from the 80's and it is very Prince influenced, but her voice and lyrical artistry make this CD worth the money. Teena Rocks!"
4,Teena Marie's strongest-selling CD of all time.,"This CD gave Teena Marie her all-time biggest hit with the classic ""Lovergirl"". While issued as a single, the power ballad ""Out On A Limb"" (strangely) made no headway on the Pop charts--it nonetheless remains one of Teena's most powerful and emotive ballads. Other noteworthy tracks include the gorgeous ""My Dear Mr. Gaye"" and ""We've Got To Stop Meeting Like This"". ""Starchild"" was Teena Marie's most commercially successful album ever."
4,learning fun,"This educational program is great for the child that would rather be playing vidio games than learning on the computer.As a parent the the 4CD set is mostly fine. The CodeHead CD isone I recommend that the parent play first, I wasn't thilledwith the way it points out wrong asnwers, I thought it was rather rude.The other 3 CD's are challenging, creative and most important your child should loved it."
5,"A must have for any guitarist, beginner to expert!","I believe that the ""Total scales and Techniques"" DVD is the single best learning resource that the beginning or advanced guitarist can find. Mark John Sternal has created the ""complete toolbox"" of the really useful tools that you need to learn the fretboard, playing techniques, and other really cool stuff. From start to finish, each section is explained and demonstrated very well. This is by far the most comprehensive help I've ever had toward reaching my own learning goals with the guitar. Thank you!"
1,poor,"I have been working with the guitar for five years which includes, music, music theory and applying both to the guitar. I purchased this DVD shortly after beginning and was so intimidated and overwhelmed I set it aside.After five years of learning songs and having gained an understanding of the layout of the fretboard and music theory I revisited this DVD. I still find it to be terrible.For me this DVD is so disjointed I don't know how anyone could make useful sense out of any of it.After reading the other reviews I guess I don't have a clue.If another beginner can get anything out of this DVD, other than total confusion, they should be well on their way."
3,The Guitar Exercises Are a Waste of DVD,"75% of this DVD is him playing guitar exercises. Different patterns of scales in different speeds where you're supposed to be playing with him. There is only a little bit of actual informative DVD but a lot of that is very basic knowledge. He focuses mainly on the major scale leaving other important scales in the dark (he does skim over the pentatonic). The music in the DVD is very dry, he might have played 3 or 4 interesting licks in the whole DVD. He doesn't give examples of how to apply the scale creatively. This is a pure theory DVD. In my opinion this DVD just tells you what the scales are, gives you practice exercises, but you have to figure out how to creatively use the scales yourself."
5,More than Games,"Games for Writing is one of the best books that I have used with my children. Their skills have improved dramatically within weeks of using several of the suggested games. After using work sheets and finding my kids bored with the same types of skills, Peggy Kaye's book was refreshing and adaptable. I have taken many of the games and altered them slightly to fit the needs of my kids. Fantastic resource for teachers, tutors and parents, who want to teach children that learning is fun."
3,realy smart,not that bad but some improvement is needed as soon as possible.this book is quit interesting and i will try my best to inform other people about it since i feel that it is interesting
5,Great book for a writing workshop!,This book has lots of good ideas that can be implemented in writing workshops for any age.
2,not for my son,"book was VERY lengthy! far to many stories and examples for my taste and, it's definitely more geared toward a younger writer as opposed to an older child. my son is in 3rd grade and i would say 90% of the book is for K-2. also, the games outlined for his age are definitely not anything he would be interested in. ever. look....if you have a younger child who might actually somewhat enjoy writing or at least not fight you to do it (which is what I get) than this would be a good book and can provide some different aspects for getting their minds flowing. for me...i have an 8yr old son in 3rd grade who would go to the ends of the earth to NOT ever have to do anything remotely related to writing or creative writing...so, this book was merely a waste of money. i ""might"" try and incorporate some of the ideas should he give me the chance to do so. until then, i have to tap into his interests which are far from anything language arts. sigh..."
1,Rca Rs1285 beware,I purchased this system less than a year ago and the cd players is not working. I've only used this system about 7 times and now this. I think this is a waste of funds. Please don't be fooled by the beauty of the machine.I want something that works at least 1year.The tape deck isn't loud the system itself seem very weak.

1,Caveat Emptor,"Seller Failed to mention this VHS was a ""Promo Not for Sale Copy"", this caption is displayed across the bottom of the screen throughout most of the Movie, If I known this I would not of purchased it, Caveat Emptor......"
2,Sort of a disappointment...,"This is a collection of works from the early-mid 80s, for ballet performance. However, two of these pieces were previously released on the ""Glassworks"" collection and as such fit better in their original context. And the cycle ""In the Upper Room"" is here not presented en toto...which is a major point of irritation, given the extended playing time of CDs. However, this is the only place you can find the ensemble version of the 'Funeral' from ""Akhenaten"", which was a show-stopper from Glass's ensemble concerts of the mid-80s. So, while this is a plus, the inclusion of the 'recycled' ""Glassworks"" tracks is annoying, and the chop-up of the ""In the Upper Room"" cycle should be considered criminal, and someone at CBS needs their head examined for continuing the vinyl sequencing present here. Boo. Hiss."
4,The paradox of variety and minimalism,"This collection gives a narrow but varied sample of Glass's pieces used by noted choreographers. The music is very danceable even for the non-professional and is highly recommended for teachers who want to broaden their dance students' sensibilities beyond stale over-orchestrated bits of ""Nutcracker"" or bubble gum pop music adored by ""dance teams""."
4,Under cover in a bygone England.,"Normally, I don't delve into juvenile literature that often, but the 1948 movie was so indelible for me that I went to Ms. Burnett's sourcework to find what treasures could be found within. Like a good yarn, it captivated me until I finished it 3 days later. There were more characters than the film (expected)and there were shifting alliances and sub-plots as you went along. Still, the suspense and mystery builds to a wonderful conclusion. Despite, subtle racial and class allusions within that may trouble politically-correct devotees, the psychological and moral lessons within for the reader outweigh any censorship as far as I am concerned knowing its historicity. The very fable itself serves notice as to the benefits of solitary improvement. What ""Treasure Island"" did for this man, ""The Secret Garden"" would surely do for any girl. A Charmingly told yarn."
5,Great purchase!,"Great jacket. Haven't had a problem with mosquitoes on my upper body since wearing this. I may need to wear pants instead of shorts, but I will say the number of bites I got on my legs went down dramatically. Also, great service from seller."
5,Excellent,For an introduction (and a very solid one at that..) to the workings of Exchange Server 5.5 - then look no further. This book has it all. Exchange 5.5 is legendary for the amount of configuration that can be done (the volume of property sheets in this product can be staggering) - this book guides you through the quagmire and leaves you feeling all the more confident about managing an exchange 5.5 environment. Indeed - after spending some time with this book and 5.5 managing exchange 2000 is a breeze...
4,Great for those new to Exchange,"This is a great administrator's book, it walks you through every step of Exchange Server. I can literally start from the beginning and set up an Exchange environment. I would, however, not recommend it to those unfamiliar with NT or networking."
3,So-so,"I've had mine for a long time, but use it infrequently. It's a bit of a pain because it runs out of water for the steam really fast, and unless you use distilled water, it's prone to scale. Also, the steam concentrators are seated very shallow and are easy to knock over. I'm surprised I haven't broken them yet. Aside from that, the facial sauna is a nice thing to have for a variety of uses. I'm just keeping an eye out for one that's more stable."
2,collective essays,"""Coping With lupus"" takes a philosophical approach to the disease. It brings together a collection of essays from different experts. Topics covered include a message of hope, lupus and kids, S.L.E. and genetics,the doctor-patient relationship. The essays are cursory without much depth. And without providing anything really ""new"".I previously purchased two other books on the subject (one by Phillips and another by Dibner). These addressed the topic more comprehensively."
5,Richard Tucker Recital,A fabulous recital sung by one of the most treasured voices of the 20th Century!
1,Short Shock for Jeep wrangler 87-95 it cant fit on,"It is Short shock for jeep wrangler Without lifts on stock YJ it Cant fit no way maybe on JK its good fit but not for YJat all shock is very cool and qualiti i orderd 4 of this 2 of front ones 2 of rear ones, the front ones fit perfectli and working proffesionallynow i should sell this shock in georgia cos i cant return cos shipping price is 50$ for two of this to by another for Good Wrangler YJ FIT just it needs Longer one with about 4-5 inch more hightshock is made in japan"
1,STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS LOST TRICKER!!,"Unlike the previous reveiwer who never used this, I had a chance to. The scope is very spotty, so when you put the saliva slide through, you just see the original spots from the microscope, it does not even matter how much or how little saliva you put onto the tray, or even if you move the tray around. There is no way to clean the microscpe as I tried to. Infact you can see the saliva tray better than putting the tray into the scope. And by the way the comapny might as well be non existant as there is no customer service, no phone # to call, and they do not answer emails. They simply just do not care!"
4,Good microscope - easy viewing,"The directions were simple, and I was able to see the changes in the patterns in my saliva. Having six slides so I could save a few days for comparison was nice. Combines with tracking my temp, this is working well for me. And it's much less expensive than using urine tests every couple of days."
4,IndieReader Review,The Whole Truth Eating and Recipe Guide is designed to give the reader a deeper understanding of food and its effect on long-term health and vitality.The book includes over 100 delicious and nutritious recipes to help the reader achieve better health with every scrumptious bite.Reviewed by IR Staff
5,Well written and poignant.,"Suzannah Lessard is to be complemented on this reflective and perceptive account. The family skeletons are unquestionably out of the closet, as she narrates the heartrending story of Evelyn Nesbitt, Harry K Thaw and her own ancestor's intertwined lives.If you have read ""Ragtime"", this is the non-fiction truth behind the tale.The murder of the brilliant architect - the ""White"" in McKim, Mead and White, whose clients included the Teddy Roosevelt White House -shocked New York's 400. This book deals not only with the events as they unfolded but also their repercussions in the author's family. Well written and poignant."
3,A beautiful blend of history and story,"If you have a closet fascination for New York and Long Island society as I do this may be the book for you. I was intrigued by the rakish stories Lessard had unearthed about her ancestors. They were told with the right combination of objectivity and affection, devoid of any syrupy family loyalty. The portrait she paints of turn-of-the-century New York is beautifully vivid and frightenly debauch. Interspersed throughout the book are depictions of Stanford White's architectural contributions to the area. Despite the man's flaws, of which there were many, Lessard is able to demonstrate that the artist is separate from his work. Whatever his personal derelictions he was still a consummate artisan."
2,Not my cup of tea..,Although extensive and factual I felt it was not a book that moved along. It felt like it took and eternity to get through each chapter. I ended up putting it down after a certain point. I know this book recieved great reviews but I found it frustrating and overly wordy.
1,"Linda Kay of NY's ""Unbelievable"" got it exactly right","An earlier reviewer, Linda Kay, wrote that this book is ""a disjointed, indulgent self-analysis of an uninteresting woman who apparently blames her famous, scandal-ridden great-grandfather for her failed life."" How right she is. Billed as being ""part memoir, part biography,"" it is actually about 5/6 rambling, disjointed ruminations about the author's own life and only maybe 1/6 about White's life (and that part contains noting revelatory, insightful or new). Some passages are written about twice, pieces of different stories are inserted randomly at several different (and inexplicably non-chronological) places, and the parts about White and Nesbit are taken (without question or analysis) almost verbatim from Nesbit's own memoirs. Did this even have an editor? Don't waste your money."
3,Great Concept that came out Too Small,"As a life-long San Franciscan, I enjoy finding out little tid bits about the ""City That Knows How"". I found this book, and thought it would make a nice Christmas gift. The varied goodies found within are interesting, and well researched. It is an entertaining way to learn some history about San Francisco. Here is the catch: When the book arrived, the box was a normal sized one, no surprize here. I opened it up to find this dinky little book, more pamphlet than book actually; the size of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich! Now, perhaps in my quest for cool Christmas gifts, I didn't read the fine print on the Amazon page. Anyway, if you are not a ""size king or queen"", get this book. You will enjoy the (here is a dead word from about 2 years ago) many factoids about Baghdad By the Bay (hey, I used ""Baghdad"" in a sentence that does not contain any reference to war! Neat!). Heab Caen would be happy about that."
5,A book for Intellectuals,A great book for the person serious about sharing their faith. This book also is informative about the differences between Islam and Christianity.Plan to take your time as you read the content is intense and full.The author is obviously very knowledgeable in this area.
5,Informative and Complete,Very informative for those needing to understand the differences between Christianity and Islam. A very thought provoking and intellectual approach--not for those who want surface information.
4,advance Praise,Mike Moore makes a strong case for the benefits of free trade and open markets. But he warns that global governance needs to be rethought to cope with the challenges of globalization. A Wide ranging and thought-provoking book
5,fantastic book for anyone serious about goats,"Very thorough book on evaluating the conformation of dairy goats, by the true expert, Harvey Considine. For anyone who shows or milks their goats. Chapters: Philosophy of Judging, Parts of a Dairy Goat, Use of the Score Card & Breed Standards for the Evaluation of Type, Evaluation of Defects, Disqualifications, Evaluating General Appearance, Evaluating Dairy Character, Evaluating Body Capacity, Mammary System, Type Deficiencies - Specific for Breed, Judging Etiquette & Ring Technique, Giving Reasons, Judging Classes of Milking Does, Judging Dry Stock, Judging Group Classes, Judging Bucks, Fitting & Showing, Judging Showmanship, Classification, Type Changes - Similarities & Differences by Age, Use of Production & Type Information.328 pages"
3,Ian Pooley - Souvenirs,"Wow, who kidnapped Ian Pooley and why is this bland imposter in his place? SOUVENIRS takes Pooley's Latin tendencies in SINCE THEN and makes them a full-blown syndrome. ""Hotel Boogie"" has an easygoing funk that sounds as if anyone could have done it. Even more upbeat tracks like ""All About You"" or ""Heaven"" are good, but don't have anything special about them. Marcos Valle's appearance on ""Sentimento"" doesn't say anything about Pooley's skills as much as it does Valle's. ""Bony Batucada"" sounds too much like tracks from SINCE THEN. ""Distant Love"" has a more personality, but it disappears by ""Insel Passage."" If this review sounds negative, keep in mind that the album as a whole is still competent and has some finger-snapping charms. But based on what Pooley has done before, it's far, far below his abilities."
1,sands of time,Just not my cup of tea. I prefer the old standards. Thank you for following up with me and bringing it to my attention.
4,testing some features,"i liked the book, its really step-by-step and its easy to understand, but iwanted the access part to be a littel larger."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I also received this as a Christmas gift and have already sent it back. The bubbles are so loud it's hard to relax, the water dosent stay warm and the infrared dosent even get warm. The accupressure attachments were very cheaply made and did nothing when I tried them out. As you can tell I was very disapointed with this product. Don't waste your money.The only up side.....I liked the color!!"
1,A Big Disappointment,"I received this as a gift for Christmas and it's now boxed up and ready to go back.The vibrating massage works fine, but that's all that works. The bubbles work until the feet go in. Once the feet are in, no more bubbles. The heat will not keep warm water warm. The ""infrared"" heat is also barely warm. I felt like it did nothing at all.It is certainly possible that this unit is defective, but for both the bubbles and heat to be defective says a lot about quality control.I did not try the attachments."
3,HoMedics Foot Salon,"My only complaint with the product I received is this: It does not have ""3 Accupressure attachments"" as indicated above, and on the information I received with the product. I would be interested in knowing if there is a different, but similar, product with these attachments?"
2,From Back Cover,"SWEET TALKER #4 - COLE WESTCOTTCole came from a long line of sexy scoundrels who thought commitment was a four-letter word. Ironic that he needed to marry to get the rest of his inheriance... and that his bride had to be the one woman on earth he couldn't sweet-talk...Tess McCrary never would have considered Cole Westcott's proposal. Sure, he was the world's most eligible bachelor, but he was also the same bully she'd shot with a BB gun when she was ten. But it was just business, really - a temporary, platonic marriage. Unfortunately, she was dangerously attracted to her hot-blooded hero and he was darn persuasive when he pointed out that, since they'd be living together anyway, they might as well share a bed...4th in the Sweet Talkin' Guys series"
1,Not The Best Feng Shui Book,I read a lot of Feng Shui Book. Lilian's Too's APPLIED PAKUA & LOSHU FENG SHUI is not comprehensive and difficult for reader to read. And it's not recommended for people interested in Feng Shui.
4,hair,"This product works really well on leg hair, but it does get painful since hair is being pulled out. I like it because it will work with only a few days worth of hair growth. When I use it on my arms, some of the hair seems to break off instead of being pulled out so that part grows back rather quickly. I can see areas on my legs where hair doesn't grow any more and it's thanks to this epilator. The annoying thing about epilators is they can only do a small section at a time while with waxing you get to remove larger strips at one go. It draws out the pain. All in all I would recommend this product. It does a good job removing hair, but seems to work better on thick hair than fine hair."
3,"Good Information, but Outdated Photos Distract and are not ""New""","This book is new expanded edition with a copyright of 2005. There were a lot of things to like in this book, but a lot of unnecessary elements. A lot of the photos use out-of-date wallpaper and furnishings (check out wallpaper on 20, 24 and 63) throughout the book, quite distracting and made me look up the copyright date.It does have some good information like installing door jambs and has more how-to information than some of the other books out there. It wastes A LOT of pages (almost 30) on things like sponging and other faux wall painting techniques, working with wallpaper and paint color choices.If this book focuses on just architectural trimwork and updated the photos, it would have gotten 5 stars. As it is, I give it 3 1/2 stars."
4,Guide book for finishing trim in your home.,I found this book to be quite helpful but not as strong in technical detail as I had hoped.
5,trimwork book,"the price was great and the book is very helpfull, I'm doing trim work in my home. Plenty of ideas to work with. anyone who is not a professional but enjoys working on their home should buy this book."
3,Where are the bullnose corners?,"I was disappointed that this ""new"" architectural trimwork book has absolutely NOTHING about bullnose corners. It is published in 2005. Come on, Jay. My house was built in 1996, and bullnose corners have been fashionable since then. Not very useful to me at all."
2,Huge disappointment,"This movie could have been so much better. The original TV show is ripe for parody, but the script writer(s) failed to make an effort. This movie is nothing but soft porn scenes held together by a minute or so of pointless dialogue. There are a few attempts at humor, but nothing to justify buying or watching this movie. Hey directors, if you're not going to attempt to get your actors to act, you might as well make a XXX film instead. This movie is DEFINITELY not worth the money."
4,erotic and fun,"I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was pretty bad but it was still fun and very erotic! Unlike Surrender, they do not dub over the love making scenes with sound and you can actually hear the skin slap together and the ladies moan. There are two decent lesbian scenes (though they lack in comparison to the final scene in Femalien). The one where Genie is chained up had a lot of potential until the goofball male genie interupted their ""fun."" In fact if not for the male Genie, I would have given this sucker five stars!!!"
3,thoughts about the dreams of jeannie,"I thought this movie has a good plot (a little simple, but I'm not watching it for the plot) the women are beautiful, also because I'm a guy I liked it that they didn't show a lot of man flesh. Nicole Sheridan makes a good Jeannie, the only thing is I got peterbed that Alexandre Boisvert (Major Nealson) didn't use her to her true ptential. They don't let you do that, but I though the movie was worth three and a half stars--if for nothing else Nicole Sheridan.In short, I liked the movie, but if I were in his place, exspecally after I found out about my girlfriend, I would have had more fun with her."
4,Erotic Dreams of Jeannie,Good for a soft porn movie. A little light on the plot but entertaining. Good sexual activities displayed.
3,"This was OK, but was expecting more...","I thought it was going to be a direct spoof of the ""I Dream of Jeannie"" TV show from the 1960's but it wasn't.It was OK if you just want to waste and hour or so of your time on soft porn."
3,My dream of Jeannie,"Good movie, this is what I really dreamed to see when the original I dream of Jeannie television show was on during the late 60's !"
3,Erotic Dreams indeed...,"The so called Jeannie really nails it down, although it would've been better if we see the Genie gets into more of the action, there are only two boy/jeannie scenes and not very good ones, and one jeannie/girl action wich kind of rounds it...But Nicole Sheridan always delivers."
5,She's Your Jeannie In The Bottle!,The Erotic Dreams Of Jeannie is a delightful sex comedy about a magical and lovely genie who becomes a sex servant to a military officer. The sex scenes and funny moments are equal to the several hot co-stars Fred Olen Ray has done it again!
2,Who are these people who thought this was good?,It's a bunch of 30-40 year olds with sagging skin pretending to get it on. Nothing erotic here. Not even funny acting. Do yourself a favor and check out Misty Mundae for some great erotic/funny movies.
3,"Erotic dreams, yes, but the rest of the film could've been better","It's a good guess that the steamy love scenes in this film might make some male members of the audience secrete a certain fluid, but the rest of the film is very amatuerishly made with synthetic outdoor settings and a scene where Dr. Reynolds calls Major Wilson ""Major Williams"" (he even can't get the character's name right) I will leave a review of mood destroying audio commentary to other fans of this genre. My complements to the makers of this DVD for not using a wide or full screen format."
4,Heart Touching,"This couple struggle with being newly parents of a baby. The book had twists and turns. Depression and oppression. Struggles that could easily happen to anyone. I was glad that they work their marriage out.The book was very deep and had me thinking about life in general. How we need to be aware of our surrounding and what we cherish we need to take care of. It is not in the drugs or woman, but we must be true to our heart.This was a very interesting book."
1,Great for Beginners - Awful for everyone else...,"If you need to learn how to Minimize windows, use a mouse, and learn various basic Windows skills, this is the book for you. If you want to learn about Win2K, skip this one. Written in simplistic terms for people who know little, if anything, about any Windows OS, this book teaches little.I bought this book hoping to immerse myself in the new WIN 2K. I feel cheated by this book: few points about WIN2K. Instead, this book focuses on basic (and I mean basic) Windows skills. I think this book should have been retitled ""WIN 2K for Dummies by Microsoft.""Skip this one and look for another alternative. This book will not teach you anything you don't already know."
1,awful product...I believe it was the vendor,"This product is awful. It smells bad! It gave me a rash on my face. The vendor does not allow returns, which was not stated on-line. I believe this product is a Knock-off, and not a true Lancome product. Do not buy cosmetics on-line, especially when they can not be returned. This vendor and product is the worst!"
4,I learned a Lot!!,"At first I thought this was one of those books where I had to read someone else's thoughts, record, then play back. This book does have some of it, but great info as well! The medition, trance, pathworking, and how to lead a group in meditaton as well, make this book worthy of your time an a place on your book shelf."
2,SO So,The flame is great for soldering but I did have the problem with the flame distorting when the valve fully opened. The thing that really bothered me is that the torch takes like 5-10 seconds to shut off. You shut it off at the valve and it has to burn off everything in the hose to go out. Its annoying if your in a hurry.
3,"Not Bad, But A Little Difficult","Miles and Scott's explanation of some concepts is quite convoluted. Students new to economics will find this text difficult. I recommend the Gans, King, and Mankiw macroeconomics textbook, which is more readable, more colorful, and more enjoyable. I am also looking forward to my lecturer's new textbook."
2,Questionable,The item pictured is of a deep red LP Matador pair of bongos. The item Im received ws bright fire engine red. Did not match picture posted on Amazon
1,Does not do more than your own hand wiping off lint,It may be better suited for dusting. Not sturdy at all. Not for suits or jackets. Waste of money. Poor Quality.
2,Goldmark misses the mark,"If you recently felt tremors in the earth, it is because deceased steel guitar legends like Jerry Byrd are now rolling in their graves. ""Strong Like Bull but Sensitive Like Squirrel"" is unusually uninspiring and unbelievably unoriginal. Both the jazzy intellectualism and Hawaiian slack-key influence of most instrumental steel guitar music has been replaced with the simple conventions of rock and pop. Granted, steel guitar music may not need twang to be good. Although if the twang is going to be surgically removed, there needs to be something of substance to fill the emptiness and Joe Goldmark leaves a soulless void. Goldmark's predictable songs are often punctuated with a Kenny G sounding saxophone or vocals that are simply embarrassing. The overall mood is light and happy as the tunes project a powerful optimism. If you enjoy light instrumental rock, you may dig this; if you're a steel guitar buff, run like hell!"
2,Disappointing,"I heard a piece of ""These Arms of Mine"" and LOVED it. Sadly, the rest of the album didn't live up. The label should read: ""Steel Guitar Lite...Jazzmatazz...No real music added."" The Delite Rancher's review says it well."
1,"Strong Like Bull, But Sensitive Like Squirrel","If you are searching for some great steel guitar instrumental music that goes in a different direction from the usual steel, this Joe Goldmark CD is totally enjoyable. By ""different direction"" I am referring to other than ""country"". Joe writes and plays a lot of his own wonderful rock and pop originals, plus throws in some offbeat covers. He plays a wacky version of the jazz standard ""Take Five,"" but plays it in 4/4 time, and does a beautiful version of Brian Wilson's ""Bells Of Madness."" He also does a strong cover of the Blind Faith ""Presence Of The Lord,"" and ends the album with Elvis Costello's ""Peace Love and Understanding."" As you can see, this is not your standard country steel album, but I would bet the ranch that even pure country enthusiasts will come around to this one too."
3,The boss?,I purchased this hoping to hear the Rick Ross I'm used to. This is quite different being it's from his suave house days. It's an ok album with a few stand out tracks. I prefer the souled out officer Ricky stuff but this is worth adding to your collection.
3,more crack serving tales from the hood yes,rick ross is back at it taling you more raps about how he came up by slinging rocks to the po nappy heads from the hood.
4,WHAT HAPPENED TO THESE GUYS?,"Bad Manners were the pioneers of Ska/New wave/Zaniness and probably a few other categories that I missed. All I know is that I went back & got this Cd to relive my early 80's party days, and wound up rediscovering the fun that was Bad Manners.For fun, you can't beat this puppy! The Cossack-sounding That Will Do Nicely opens up the Cd, with the fun & echoey Salad Bar next. Tonight is Your Night is a great sing along while Sampson & Delilah & Exodus are great!My Girl Lollipop might have been done before, and recived the radio play, but remains my favorite, none-the-less.The Cd then goes into some hummable tracks, including the nutty remake of Van Morrisons Whats Up Crazy Pup! It may seem to you like I reviewed just about every song, and you'd be right! It's just that good. Listen to it yourself!(Whatever happened to Fatty Buster Bloodvessel, and more importantly, does he still hold the record for the most Big Macs eaten in one sitting?)."
2,Not what I thought.,"I bought this thinking that it was the Swedish rock band Witchcraft. It is definately not. This isn't a review of the album, just trying to pass along the word to someone who might make the same mistake I did."
3,Depends ...,"This might sound weird, but it depends on what you want to do with it.You're probably thinking:""Duh!"" but I'm quite serious.It is NOT a good replacement for your manicurist.First of all, keep in mind that the cord is about 2 feet long (or shorter) so if you want to use it without facing the wall (it won't reach otherwise), make sure you have an extension cord.Second of all, not all of the accessories are actually useful. Out of the SIX heads, only THREE were of any use. The other three are either too rough to use or don't reach or act the way it is supposed to do (based on directions in manual).Third of all, it's too rough on natural nails. I would only recommend it if you have acrylic and need to smooth rough edges or need to fix something and can't make it to the manicurist."
3,This should come with a video how to,"I received this product for Christmas. It did a wonderful job on my toenails. How could you mess up toenails.However, you'd better be careful doing your nails on your hand. Not being familiar with the product I grooved out part of my nails when trying to just remove the cuticle.Be careful, it takes talent."
1,Not worth the money.,"I was really disappointed with this product. Does not work well at all. I did not return it, but considered doing so. Wish I would not have bought it. Can do my nails just as well with an old fashionsed file............. Don't waste your money...........Wish someone would have warned me."
1,Be Careful - this item is not rechargable!!!!,... that this was a rechargable product. It is NOT rechargable and you are tethered to the AC power supply which has a very short cord. I am very disappointed ...!!
3,down with electric guitars,"frank's playing as usual is superior , but that maudlin guitar [!] really hurts this recording."
1,Not as advertised,"The add said ""The lovely, frosted glass figure in multi-layered gown, poses serenely with folded hands, atop a silver base. Behind her, the sparkle of clear glass lends an extra glow to the sculpture.""The figurine is 100% plastic and very misleading. I would give ""no stars"" if this was an option. These people should be barred from selling on Amazon."
1,disapointing buyer,i got this angel in thinking it was frosted glass and it had fiber optic though out the angel as the add said.. well to my suprise it was completely plastic and no fiber optics at all it has i light at the base which shines up in to a hollowed out plastic angle.. i feel this add and item should be removed from amazon till the seller updates it with the ture decription on the item. i rate this product a negative 5 stars..
4,Ayia Napa - Various artists,Cool album - first CD is a continuous mix of UK underground garage and is top quality. Almost all the tracks are good if you like the kind of fast tempo garage that was more popular in 1998. Nice remixes of many of the tunes by Tuff n Jam and Booker T. Second CD is more RnB style though still good. Actually it starts off very RnB and then progresses more to garage. Mostly individual tracks here. If both CDs were like the first I would give 5 stars!
2,one of the less useful references on Victorian milk glass,"I recently bought a copy of this out of print book on Amazon. It doesn't have much info about covered dishes, despite the cover illustration, and in general doesn't have enough useful illustrations or cover enough categories of glass.I've been slowly building a library of all the old milk glass books-- this is my least favorite. Save your money."
4,Very Healthy but my rats don't like it,"I have always made sure my rats have a complete diet by buying food specifically designed for rats and adding fruits, veggies, grains, nuts, seeds, some yogurt and meats,etc. However, although I have had rats most of my life and regularly took them to vets for check ups...the vets always said my Kaytee brand rat food was good. Recently I have done research and noticed that many vets say that those mixes are not good for them because they contain corn and also rats tend to only pick certain things out so they don't get a complete diet. So I decided to by Regal Rat as it seems to be the best complete diet out there that doesn't contain corn. Would have rated this 5 stars but I can't get my rats to eat it, they simply don't like it and would rather starve than eat this food. It's been about a week and I'll keep trying to transition them to this food but so far no luck."
4,fat rats,"My rats like this but as spoiled rats they must have something sweet and juicy in it so I put fruit and veggies with it,,,I would recommend this for part of a rats diet."
5,Little one loves it,"No rough transitions here, my rat can't get enough of the Oxbow. He's not a picky eater in general but he gets visibly excited when I'm refilling his food bowl with it. I like the way they're shaped too, makes it easier for his little paws to hold. I got the ""Improved Formula, New Flavor!"" version (says it on the top right-hand side of the bag) and to me it looks exactly like dog food, being that he think he's a miniature-sized Labrador maybe that's why M. like it so much."
3,"Great diet, but not all rats like it.","This diet is very well balanced and lasts a long time. However, my two girls really dislike the flavor and refuse to eat it. I understand that Oxbow is working on a new formula with an improved taste, so I will buy that when it comes out.Just be prepared: not all rats will enjoy this food. But, good news, if your ratties don't like it you can donate it to a shelter!"
4,wish the rats liked it better,"I think this is a really healthy food for rats, it smells very fresh and isattractively packaged, and the only thing I find wrong with it is that myrats don't particularly like it. They will eat it quite well for a few days,but after that they kind of politely ignore it until there's nothing else intheir bowls. Then they hide it behind their boxes or stack it in the corneras if by emptying their bowls they can cause new and DIFFERENT food toappear. Aside from that it really is the best rat food that I've found."
3,healthy but not palatable,"My rats will not eat this food, although the ingredient list is pretty good. Two thing to note: it includes fish meal and soybean meal (Soybean meal not contains phytoestrogens)and it's an ""open"" formula - meaning as long as there is still more A than B ingredient, the relative quantities can shift with market conditions."
2,Great if they would only eat it.,"Five stars for nutritional value/availability/price - the problem is my rats can't stand it. If there was something that could be done to make it more palatable this product would be awesome, unfortunately unless it changes I will not purchase again."
5,for christmas present...don't know yet,Purchased for a christmas present so can't rate it yet. I'm sure my son will be thrilled with it...
5,Children's books in Spanish,"A friend is teaching her toddler Spanish, he is barely speaking English but is picking up the second language quickly. They loved the two children's books this one and the Green Eggs and Ham in Spanish. The entire family is learning a second language - however the children are doing so much faster and with less effort than the parents.They said the books made it a fun evening reading."
3,Time to send Hud on his way!,"I'm a great fan of the Benni Harper series. It's one of the best mystery series around. However, I was disappointed with this book. Benni, of course, was great, but the mystery was kind of nonexistent. And Benni's husband, Gabe, was barely present, and when he was there, he was merely a shadow of himself. Also, wasn't anyone else bothered by Deputy Sheriff ""Hud"" Hudson's blatant attempts to destroy Benni's marriage by trying to seduce her to commit adultery --a kind of in your face to Gabe. Please, Earlene, send Hud packing and get back to Gabe and the rest of the wonderful characters you created (Dove, Elvira, Sam, etc.), who had only cameo roles here."
4,Actually i havent read THIS book i'm sure its good tho,i've read the rest.. i wanted to comment about peoples comments on Benni being a ninny she is not.. and flirting with Hud. evidentally people forgot that Gabe did the same thing to HER in Steps to the altar.. i think a little payback is a good thing.
3,I'm sorry but this wasn't one of my favorites...,"I love this series, but this one just seemed to drag a bit. Like another reviewer said, don't start with this one. Go back to the beginning of the series. I still enjoy Ms.Fowler's writing and look forward to reading the next in the series."
2,not as good at the others!,"I LOVE THIS SERIES, but this book is not good. I read a lot of mysteries, and I could swear I have read this plot about the bones and the story behind them before in another book??? I agree with the other people who have reviewed this book - the other main characters whom I love are missing for most of the book... Ms Fowler seems to have thrown them in for a chapter or two just to say ""hi,"" which is not good enough for me. I too am tired of Hud. I want Benni to remain faithful to Gabe, and the silly flirting with Hud is a waste of space. I was disappointed."
3,Okay--at least there was an actual ending to this one,The storyline was okay; the main negative for me was Benni's cousin Reta. I can't stand that irritating woman and why she has to put in an appearance when not even connected to the storyline is beyond me. As far as I could tell there was no point to including her in the scenario. Earlene Fowler could just as well have saved her energy! I did appreciate the detailed ending which was an improvement over a couple of the other books in this series.
3,The best part is missing,"The score itself rates at least a 4 out of 5, for reasons others have already given, but I take off a point because the CD release doesn't include the street music."
1,Blah,"I listened to this whole CD at a friend's house. Being a fan of Medieval/Renaissance music, I expected very much to enjoy this CD. I was extremely dissapointed. It was terribly dull. Nothing sounded unique at all, or had any kind of Renaissance flare to it. To be blunt, it bored the hell out of me. I definitely didn't notice this music at all even as I was watching the movie. It never captured my attention in any way. Now I know why it didn't. Its the same wishy washy theme to every romantic movie. I recommend the sountrack to <i>Elizabeth</i> instead of this dull waste of time."
3,It gets the job done.,"However, I find that while the movie is excellent and full of life, the soundtrack only has certain parts that bring back that ambiance. I suggest buying the movie if you liked the music, because only about 15 percent of the soundtrack will be recognizable to you. But it is very pretty."
2,TechNet in a book,"Handy book to have around the shop, although nothing more than a reprint of Technet."
1,Don't waste your mony in this book,"I'm currently reading this book to enter the MCSE Exam, I finished 5 chapters out of 15. I think I'm wasting my time and already wasted my money.I think it's one of the worest MS Press books."
3,it works,This tip works but I really think it should be included in the charger package. Having to purchase it separately makes it cost a bit too much. It is however necessary if you want to get full power functionality from you laptop while using the Targus charger.I rate it 3 because of the cost factor but it is a 5 for functionality.
3,Book is great if you can get the stickers,"I have copies of this book for two of my kids and they are beautiful when the personalized stickers arrive, they blend so well with the pictures you can't even tell they were added later. Trying to get a personalized copy for my third child has been an ordeal, however. The information card enclosed in my first copy was from a company that no longer exists. There was NO information card enclosed in the replacement copy sent, and this book is useless without the personalized stickers. I'll try to order it elsewhere."
2,Not very good,"This book has 2 stories- the first is about a doctor who finds he can make more money by cheating his patients, and the second is about a wounded Civil War doctor. I wasn't much impressed by either of them- the writing is OK, but I'm disgusted by dishonest doctors, and the second story came to a dead end."
2,cook book,"I did not use this book, it did not have anything I thought look good to me, but I am sure there are lots of good things in it."
4,healthy vegan fare,"a solid good cookbook for those aspiring to the vegan diet. the only drawbacks being that some recipies require hard-to-locate ingredients such as vegan gelatin and smoked yeast. Other than that a very worthwhile purchase for those wishing to eat healthy, etc."
5,"ANGEL FIRE, A Powerful Reading Experience!","Ron Franscell's, ANGEL FIRE, delivers a unique literary tale of the McLeod brother's, Cassidy and David, individual lives that meld together when tragedy strikes the pair.With artiful skill, Franscell gives his readers greater insight to the sibling's bond by taking them back in time to their adolescent years, in the rural town of West Canaan, Wyoming.ANGEL FIRE introduces you to other vivid characters such as Fakey Ducas, Twin Tommy Ganneman and the very imaginative, Pledger Moon. All woven into the fabric of the brother's lives adding greater depth to their compelling journey.Winner of the 1996 Wyoming Literary Fellowship, Ron Franscell's ANGEL FIRE proves to be a winner in more ways than one!"
5,I was lucky to find this book,"A few months ago, I saw a review of this book in USA Today and I thought it was odd that a major national newspaper would review a first book by an unknown author, published by a small house. So I decided to give it a try, and now I want as many people as possible to know about ""Angel Fire."" It was a gem! I am an avid reader and I like a lot of books, but here's one that combines great characters, imaginative plot and extraordinary drama. Anybody who has spent any time in a small town will fall in love with this book. I was moved nearly to tears. Wow! There's a lyrical beauty and muscular simplicity in Ron Franscell's writing, and I'm sure he'll eventually show up on the radar of some bigger publishers. Until then. I'd suggest readers ask for this book or buy it on Amazon, just don't miss it!"
5,Beautifully written....,I discovered Angel Fire and Ron Franscell quite by accident recently and soon realized that I had struck gold! Ron's descriptions of small town life and brotherly love were so real and touching I had to keep reminding myself that I was reading fiction. This is a beautifully written book that I will keep and treasure and read again.
5,Strong scenes written with authority and grace; stunning!,"At first I thought, Oh, this is a man's book: two brothers, a war tragedy, the Wyoming landscape. What a surprise when I opened to the first page and could not stop reading. Authentic writing about the Wyoming landscape and its small towns, a narrative style that gallops into shocking scenes, tender scenes, twists and turns. The book is filled with suspense yet pauses to let us see the power of love that can exist between brothers, brothers you will swear you know in person. I can't wait for the author's next book. Ron Franscell can't help but hit the bestseller lists."
4,Abundant heart and flawless prose make ANGEL FIRE a keeper.,"Wyoming newspaperman Ron Franscell has had years to hone his writerly craft...years to learn the art of weaving words and stories together.But ANGEL FIRE is a far cry richer than the who, what, when, where and why of Franscell's journalistic roots. It is a book built of heart and tenderness, the story of two brothers raised in rural Wyoming. ANGEL FIRE follows Daniel and Cassidy McLeod through their ever changing lives and relationships. It reveals not only what they do, but why it matters.Ron Franscell was awarded the 1996 Wyoming Literary Fellowship for the first few chapters of ANGEL FIRE. The balance of the book will undoubtedly win him critical acclaim and hordes of literary devotees -- fans undoubtedly eager for more.ANGEL FIRE is understated brilliance. And, hopefully, Ron Franscell has only just begun."
5,just what she wanted,My sister loves this show and wanted this for her birthday. She was happy that I got it for her.
2,good but pricey,"Part of my dissatisfaction with this product was due to my failure to read entirely the description. Since it takes 6 lbs to fill my paraffin bath I expected each package to contain 6 lbs and they contained only 2 lbs. After purchasing 2 packages, there was still not enough paraffin to refill my bath. However the quality is excellent and melts easily."
5,Great Product,Like this product very much and order it whenever I need some. Would reccommend it to others.
5,"Nice Product, Nice Feel","This is a very good product, melts well and leaves your hands and feet feeling wonderful. I would buy again."
1,This wax is HORRIBLE,"I bought this in order to help my hands/fingers feel better after a long day at work. I've purchased this product in the past and it had a pleasant scent and left my hands soft.The wax I received however STINKS, literally! It has such a strong unpleasant smell that it gave me a headache. It is also very oily and doesn't make my hands/fingers feel soft/massaged as they did in the past.DON'T buy it!"
4,hot wax feels fine.,I used this wax to soak my hands in heater hand tub. It gives pain relief from joint discomfort and allows mobility of my hands. I enjoy the heat and mobility that I feel from this heated wax. Works well and provides comfort.
2,Disappointing,"Sold as ""replacement paraffin"" as if this would replenish old paraffin . Did not cover with 2"" depth requiring additional purchase locally to fill spa to a useable level."
3,Nice little dive light,"The problem with this is that you have to be REALLY careful about turning it off and on under water. (It also just comes on by itself underwater sometimes!) I flooded the previous one, because if you turn it just a little too much that happens. It gives just a little light, but is very compact, which is why I chose it. Not great for night dives."
1,"Three different Princeton tec flash lights, three different problems","I own Three different Princeton Tec Flashlights. All have broken/stopped working.None of the flashlights were abused or over used.The Impact XL rotating Bezel that turns light on and off cracked rendering the flashlight uselessPrinceton Tec flashlights (in my humble opinion and experience with three different modles) have a nice design and feel to them, but lack in quality and reliability.For the price, I think you can do MUCH better."
5,Stubborn dogs,I have very stubborn dogs that like to break loose when they can from a fenced in yard. I orginally got one for one the dogs and then ordered the kit for two because I was so happy with the difference in the one dog I needed it for both!
5,Lots of laughs...,"This teeter-totter is a great toy. My 2 and 4-year-old girls have so much fun playing on it together (and they don't fight over this toy because they need each other to play on it). It's light, and extremely easy to assemble - the main frame and two handles - no screws needed. The price is affordable."
4,A Great Ride.,"I bought this for my one and two year old, while having the neighbor kids in mind, as well. They all play together and three kids can play at the same time. smaller children can enjoy this as well with supervision. I will say that it may not always be the first toy the kids run to in our yard, but, the kids enjoy it a good amount. Also, I sometimes sit my 5'10 frame on this as I monitor my kids in the yard, and darn it, YES! It is sturdy and durable. It has sat out it the rain as well, and shows no signs of problems, or discolorations. Looks like new. Now THAT is something! Would I buy it again? Probably. Yes."
4,MY Girls are enjoying This,"I bought this today to replace an old teeter totter we got awhile ago shaped as an animal. I wasnt sure at first because the box was so small and i thought ""how could that fit even 2?"" but when I got it home and the girls sat on it, it was perfect. they go up and down far more than the other one did. and no asembly. just snap the handles on. my girls are 5, 3, and 1 the box says weight limit is 40 lbs per child and my 5 year old is 52lbs, and it seems to hold her ok. but to warn you... when my 1 year old 23 lbs sat on it. and my 3 year old sat with her the poor dear went flying in the air and landed in the middle.just remember its for 2 year olds and up lol"
2,Not So Pleased!!,I bought this for my only child who is 3 years old. I was trying to find something she could play on by herself or if she has a friend over. She lasted about 2 minutes and was bored. So were her friends. They tell you 3 kids can play on this and that is NOT so! We tried 3 and they would easily have knocked their heads together and these are little framed kids. Not so pleased! Would return it but she likes to stand up on it and jump off of it instead.
5,Great Outside Toy!!!,"We just bought this for my daughter, who is 3 1/2, and in need of some new outside toys, because she is an only child, it is sometimes hard to buy the ones she wants. After reading all the reviews online, I knew this was the one. She can do it by herself of with friends, last night there were 3 other little girls over (ages 20 months, 2 years, 3 1/2 years and 5 years) All four actually loved it, the two smaller ones and the two older ones! GREAT TOY! I would buy agian!"
4,Teeter Totter....tips...,This is a really fun toy for my 2.5 and 4.5 year olds but it can be dangerous. My son can easily topple my younger daughter over backwards just by getting off it quickly. The teeter totter then pops up in the air and crashes down on top of her. I would still say that it is a fun and fairly safe toy. It just works better (obviously) with kids that are fairly similar in size and weight.
4,Teeter-Totter,I purchased the teeter-totter for my twin grandsons who are 2 years of age. Within a couple of minutes they were able to make it go by themselves. I think it's a great toy for twins without having to buy 2 items like I need to do for almost everything else.
3,Naturally Playful Teeter,"I bought this for my 27 month old who is tall. She will not get alot of use from this because I thought it was alot bigger (longer and higher). Her legs seem to be getting too long for it. She does like playing on it, but it seems it works best used on a hard surface because it sinks into the grass or sand from the body weight."
4,"Fun toy, but better for 2!","My 18mth old daughter got this teeter totter for Christmas from her Granny. It took her a while to work it out, but now she loves it. It seems to be well made & durable & I love that it fits on the patio of our apartment with no problem! My only problem (which isn't a fault of the toy at all) is that it is obviously designed more for 2 than 1, and since my baby is the first child I am constantly getting called to go on it with her! All in all a great outdoor toy, durable, small enough for an apartment patio & lots of fun!"
3,Not the best in Trance...,"At first glance this cd appears to be great...a lot of tracks and great trance anthems but buyers beware...it's not even half of that. The cd is not mixed well at all. It's definitly not how these songs were played in Ibiza...there isn't a smooth transition from one song to the next. Don't get me wrong, mixing aside, these songs are trance at it's best but, as soon as you start to get into a song, it's over and the next song begins. I would say the AVERAGE song is 3-4 min. long...in dancing and prancing time that is way to short...so I recommend saving your money and instead purchasing ""Ministry of Sound Clubbers Guide to...Trance"" mixed by ATB. This cd is also a reflection of the 1999 year in trance and it is so much better! It has a lot of the same songs as the Ibiza cd but ATB plays with them oh so much better than this UNKNOWN DJ does.."
2,NOT IMPRESSED!,"I talked to a lot of people that said Ibiza makes great progressive/euro trance cd's. Well, this cd does not do it for me. There are a couple of ""ok"" tunes in their like the generator's ""where are you now"", and kay cee does a pretty good job mixing ""1999"", and there are a lot of good artists on this cd, but for some reason, the songs nor the artists really move you. I must say, I really thought I would enjoy this much more. If you dont have future trance V. 8, get it and trust me, you will be thanking me because this cd will move you. This Ibiza cd also has too many housy vocal tunes too."
2,good songs but too many. bad mix.,"OK. First off I own more than 50 trance/techno cd's. I am also a trance artist (Alpha Project), so I think my opinion holds some weight. When you're talking music like trance always be skeptical when you see a CD or double CD that has 17-20 songs per CD. This Compilation has 20 songs on each CD. Now a lot of these songs are great but this mix really stinks. Every time a nice groove gets going it transitions to the next cut. We're not talking smooth transitions here, we're talking four bars and you're completely in the next song (basically no transition). It's like they cut out the intro and outro and just left the main theme of each song. Trance music is all about building up the tention, and this double CD definitely doesn't do that..."
