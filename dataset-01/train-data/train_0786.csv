3,the worst audrey hepburn,interresting movie but the story and the scenes are a bit too long and boring for its outcome
2,Disappointing star vehicle,"This was clearly an experiment in teaming up the long-established (and ever-charming) Audrey Hepburn with up-and-coming British star Albert Finney, who never did quite go on to become the matinee idol some had hoped, despite getting a good headstart with Tom Jones (1965). Here, however, the match is awkward, and not helped by a fairly witless script and an overall lack of coherence. The thin plot is terribly structured, meandering here and there at a deathly pace, and ending up nowhere in particular.The combination seemed great: Donen directing Hepburn with a snazzy score by easy listening giant Henry Mancini; It was never meant to be, however. This reviewer was left sorely disappointed, wondering where the last two hours of his life had vanished to."
1,A 1967 Vogue Photo Shoot....Not a Movie,"The locations, the clothes, Audrey's hair - they all look fabulous. But this movie is a big SNOOZER! It's overly stylized and hard to follow - a 1960s movie experiment gone awry. It's different and modern for the sake of being different and modern, and nothing else. And, god forbid I should say this, but Audrey Hepburn is just horrible in this movie. She is so obviously ACTING - she's stiff and affected.""Two for the Road"" would have made a wonderful multi-page fashion spread in the June 1967 issue of Vogue, but as a full-length motion picture it's a big dud!"
4,My granddaughter loved this!!,"I bought this tea cart for my 16 month old granddaughter, she is a little tall for her age so the height was perfect. She loved pushing the cart and served me and her grandfather in the cute little cups. I also loved the colors and it cleans up pretty easily. I did put up the pretty little rose as I didn't want her putting it in her mouth. Overall I and my daughter were very pleased with the Disney Princes Tea Cart."
4,Great tea set and cart,"I bought this for my twin toddlers who are over 2 years old and they love it. They love playing with the tea set and pretending to mix tea and drink it. They also have fun pushing the tea cart all over the apartment. The tea cart was easy to assemble, and the only drawback I found so far was that when I handwashed all the little cups, saucers etc before the first use, I noticed that the labels with the princesses' pictures on the cups got all wet and damaged. I wish the manufacturer could have used some plastic material instead of paper so that this would not have happened in the first place."
3,vision just short of living,"this is the second album of a great New Jersey hardcore band, they went in a differnt direction and this has a much more produced/ ""studio"" markeded sound as opposed to the previous ""blink"" which was a great LP."
1,Pointless,"This book really wasn't necessary. I'm sure Gordon wanted to cash in more on the success of the first book(which I found enjoyable) but really didn't have any more Ace stories. So instead we get 300 pages of internet chatter, transcripts from interviews that he had done to promote the first book and 30 pages of royalty information for some of Ace's songs from Kiss. He snipes at a couple of haters, and ends the book with a big F-you to Ace. Some of the stuff is interesting, and their are a couple of new stories from guest writers. I really think this should have been put on a web site. It would make an interesting footnote to the first book, but on its own, it is not worth the price."
1,waste of money,What an exciting book - just a bunch of emails/news group posts of Gordon defending himself. Nothing new in this book.
1,Bad Bits,These bits are a joke. I spent 45 minutes trying to drill a hole in a stone and only managed a hole about 1/16 inch deep. I used 3 different bits to do this. They were a waste of money.
3,Stones don't make it,"I'd heard that if you want to drill through stones, such as for making jewelry as I am trying to do, use a diamond-tipped or coated drill. Well, I tried these drills last week and I must say, if I'm going to drill through a stone, I'd better have patience. A lot of patience. They do start to make a dent, but it would take a long time to go all the way through. I'm sure I'll have much better luck with drilling polymer clay."
3,Very juvenile,Great for young children. Not very interesting for older kids or adults. Didn't hold the interest of a family group.
3,Breaks Too Easily,"Maybe I just have a strong hand in my play, but my experience with the Head Metalix 140 equals 2 ordered racquets, 2 broken racquets, two reshipped racquets, 4 broken in total. It played great while I had it and minus the stock grip which I replaced, its a great racquet, built for comfort not to last."
4,"Good Music, Energy","As far as I am concerned the only realy good song on this CD is the opener,""Perry Mason"" That I have played a number of times. The others are typical Ozzy.Don't get me wrong though, The other songs are very well sung and are worthy of the master."
3,NotAsHeavyAsHisOlderAlbums,"This CD wasnt that bad, but it wasnt as heavy as his other albumbs and thats what i like about ozzy."
2,Weak album for Ozzy,"Don't believe what you read from Johnny come lately's with pathetic ""Ozzy rocks!"" exclamations. Of course Ozzy rocks, that's why you are reading this, instead of a review of a Bee Gee's album, which gets -2,000,000 stars in my book.It's as simple as this: Ozzy should have left us with No More Tears. This album was not necessary and is overall flat with the exception of good songs such as, Perry Mason, Thunder Underground, and My Jeckyll Doesn't Hyde, which still would have been left on the floor if proposed for No More Tears."
3,Not his best,"Simply put, Ozzmosis is Ozzy's worst album. I like the clever title but the music is lacking. Perry Mason and Thunder Underground are probably the best songs. Even if all the songs were as good as those two, it would still be one of his worst albums. Zack Wylde is a great guitarist, but he isnt a great songwriter when compared to the likes of Tony Iommi or Randy Rhoads. The ultra-modern, overproduced sound (almost industrial at times) that Ozzy started with the ""No More Tears"" album is taken to an extreme on this album and makes for a somewhat dull and lifeless feeling. Very few melodies really catch you like they should. I love Ozzy, but Ozzmosis misses the mark, at least for me."
2,Ozzy's weakest album!,"Attempting to breach out into alternative territory-like using Soundgarden's producer-was a total flop for this artist..Even the presence of Rick Wakeman did not do much for this 1995 effort,marked(and marred)by uninspired songwriting and a very unfocused performance from Zakk Wylde.There is much better in Ozzy's catalog!"
1,Wretched!,"Oh, come on people! Aside from a couple of the reviewers, thus far, everyone has had good or great things to say about this disc. This album is horrid! This is what happens when Sharron Osborne,(Ozzy's wife/manager) gets too involved in his music. This is the most degrading piece of schlock Ozzy has ever put out. It makes ""Bark at the Moon"" look like a landmark epic! When I saw Ozzy on the first Ozzfest, when he was touring in support of this album, he did ONE song off of this and the rest of the night's performance was filled with Sabbath songs. That should tell you what Ozz himself thinks about this release.Do yourself a favor, either buy anything from ""Ultimate Sin"" and back, or go check out some Metal bands which are truly carrying the torch for this genre such as In Flames, Blind Guardian, Gamma Ray, or Nevermore. Leave ""Ozzmosis"" in the warehouse where it belongs... to gather dust and decompose."
1,Dissapointing!,"Very dissapointing album by one of the godfathers of metal(Blizzard of ozz,what a memory!)The man's voice is so bad that I can't even think how it would sound live.The songs are very weak,I don't think that there is at least 1 song who rocks hard on this album.Forget this album right now and go get the best live album ever from a metal band:Dio's inferno the last in live.You'll see on there how's a real metal voice."
3,Ozzy Starts To Rely On Too Many Outsiders,"The first thing that is totally apparent on this album by the Ozzman is that Zakk Wylde was not very involved in its writing. Sure, Zakk is playing on it, but there is something missing, some of the feeling that was there before. pehaps Zakk is startintg to get bored of Ozzy's antics. After the threatened retirement of No More Tears, Ozzy is back with an album filled with inconsistencies. Perry Mason is a certified rocker. So is Tomorrow and I Just Want You. Thunder Underground is likable. See You On The Other Side is tolerable. After that there isn't much but filler. The Ozzy/Steve Vai penned My Little Man is simply there. Ozzy sounds tired here. Too bad."
5,A great CD for all times!,"With such a diverse mixture of music on this CD it continues to be one of my favorite Ozzy CDs. The lyrics (as always) kick A** and the guitar (as always) also KICKS A**! Ozzy at his best if you ask me, this is most likely his last good original album, GET IT!"
3,"Good, Not Great","This album has some very good songs on it (Perry Mason, I Just Want You, Thunder Underground, Tomorrow) and a lot of so-so songs. Overall, it is a very soft Ozzy album without a lot of rockers. I love Ozzy ballads, especially when they are sprinkled in (1 or 2 per album) with the heavier stuff. This album, however, has heavy rockers sprinkled in with a sea of ballads. The good songs on it are VERY good, but overall it is one of Ozzy's weakest albums, imo. Still, if you're an Ozzy fan, it's got to be a part of your collection."
3,Kind of weak...but not that bad,"I mainly bought this CD for the first track, ""Perry Mason"". When I first heard it on the radio, I couldn't get enough. However, the rest of the songs are pretty weak...with the exception of Thunder Underground. All in all, I feel it was a mediocre album."
2,Worst Ozzy Album Ever!,"Generally speaking, if the first song on an album is the one you're looking for, it's a safe bet that the rest of the album is mostly filler. Ozzmosis is no exception.Perry Mason and See You on the Other Side are, in my opinion, the only worthwhile songs on this album. Most fans would probably add I Just Want You to the list.The point is, out of this album's ten songs, there are, at most, three good ones, and 30% is a low success rate.The good news is, Perry Mason, See You on the Other Side, and I Just Want You are all available on Essential Ozzy."
5,ozzy's in the house,"This is one of ozzy's best w/zak.great production,great songs.Need I saymore?see you on the other side."
4,Ozzy & Zakk At Their Second Best,"Ozzmosis took me by surprise. I'm not sure what I was expecting with this album, but I was actually impressed all the same. *My* favorite guitarist, Zakk Wylde, came back to work with Ozzy one more time and encouraged him to take a few chances musically. In my opinion, they payed off (most notably in ""Old LA Tonight"" with Zakk on the piano).In my opinion, the lyrical depth of this album is only surpassed by ""No More Tears"". This has a certain emotional depth that Ozzy's earlier albums lacked and Zakk's guitar work is absolutely amazing (I would expect nothing less from the man).The bottom line: if you're an Ozzy fan and you liked No More Tears, then you will enjoy this album. On the other hand, if you're expecting another Blizzard of Oz, you may want to check yourself and then still give this album a chance while listening to it with fresh ears. People change. Artists change (and grow). This is a natural progression for Ozzy that I feel is quite eloquently executed."
4,good,Wonderful songs. Only complaint: Why do the musicians not put out as much energy as their capable of? Their lack of energy really weakens an otherwise great album. It could have been SO MUCH better.
3,Pretty solid.,"Until just recently, I haven't listened to Ozzmosis for quite some time. It didn't interest me much when I first listened to it a few years back. Listening to it now, I think that it's pretty good, though. All of the songs are listenable. Ozzy does well with the vocals, too. Ozzmosis is mostly in the same musical vein as the previous album. The only difference is that this album is quite mellow, and the songs tend to be slower in tempo. It's still somewhat heavy--just in a slower way. Zakk Wylde never disappoints with his guitar work. He has his own sound. The album is basically in a commercial hard rock direction. The production is pretty good, and the songwriting and musicianship are satisfying. I don't have any favorite songs. I find them all to be good. It would've been nice if there had been some tunes with faster tempos, though. Ozzmosis is pretty solid. Worth a listen."
3,"""Thunder Underground' one of the best Ozzy songs!","Buy this cd for ""Thunder Underground"" alone. One of the best Ozzy songs ever! You will never hear it on the radio because it rocks!"
5,"Strong, Brilliant & Intelligent Music.","Was introduced to HHF with this album when I was in Australia. It is so good I just can not compare any of the other albums as good as this one, not even the latest 'Born'. In fact I'm so much into music that I was telling a friend I would love to be remembered with this album, cause I always introduce my friends with the new or rare stuff. I wonder why this never really hit it big which is good in a way cause when you hear it it just blows your mind from the begining to the end, ""this is it (your soul)"" being the most out standing.The lyrics are simple but strong and the music does not go over the top. Excellent piece of work!!!!!!!!!"
5,Songs from the Rain,I love the way this music has the ability to transport me to another level of relating to the world. We all seem to be looking for ways to relax and be well. This powerful CD has the music to facilitate that journey to wellness and peace.
5,old school excellence,"I previewed this CD and was pleasantly surprised by both the selection of songs and the quality of the recordings. The music is excellent and the vocals are great. As a mobile DJ I usually have a lot of requests for Oldies at class reunions and ""baby boomer birthday bashes"" .... at a gig in August of 2009, these Rocky Padilla numbers were a smash hit and a lot of partygoers wanted to know ""who that was?"" Very good collection and a must have for the collector of old school or oldies music."
1,I will die of boredom when i want,"I had to read this play as part of my International Baccalaureate English A1 HL course, World Literature section.this is the WORST play I have ever, ever read.Being a lover of English, I desperately struggled to find something good about this play, but I couldn't. The musical interludes only add to the all-round tedium of this play. do not read it unless you have to, I implore."
5,A wonderful Film,"I never have many expectations about gay cinima...few and far between arewell written, are well acted and have great cinimatogrophy. This one hits a home run by hitting all three. Wonderful story, great acting, and wonderful production value - and an added bonus of a great soundtrack. I wont repeat the story, but its very uplifting - and is based on real people and real issues. BRAVO ps i havent been moved before to write a review...wanted to add my praise."
3,Disappointed,"Wow, I can't believe all the five star reviews of this agonizingly slow film. The film is technically very well made, and Trevor Wright's acting is wonderful (about the only thing going for it), but the movie seemed 5 hours long to me. It took a half hour to get going and then moved at such a slow pace it was like it was stuck in slow motion to get to the very predictable conclusion. This is not a movie I would want to watch a second time. Disappointment."
1,Shelter My Eyes!,"Let me see, gay surf movie. Uh-huh. Anyone have a link for ""Masters of the Universe,"" now that's a real man's movie."
4,Accepting whatever it is you're meant to be,"Sometimes, some very rare times, there comes a person in our lives who pushes us and forces us to become better; who helps us to figure out who we are meant to be. But sometimes this person is not the one we've always thought s/he would be. And some unfortunate times, we let this person go.This movie deals with this dillemma: A guy is inspired by another, who happens to be his best friend's older brother, and ends up falling for him - completely against everything's he's ever known.His journey dealing with that and starting to think about what *he* really wants - not his sister, not anybody else, what HE wants - is truly not be missed. This is a wonderful movie that hopefully will be 'discovered' by more and more people in the future."
4,Lovely,"This movie was great, I loved it. But my reason for giving it four stars is the fact that it lacked passion. Both lead actors are straight, and that came across in many of the romantic scenes. It seemed almost too buddy buddy at times. Other then that, it was great. One of the best gay love stories out there."
4,Shelter was excellent!,"Shelter was a very true depiction of what many young men experience as they come to deal with gay feelings. The story was well developed, and also I thought one that is true many times in everyday life. As a gay man, it was worth the time and money spent at the theatre and when I purchased it for home use. ENJOY!"
4,much more than average,"wonderful movie about a guy who is torn between his family and his new found love. Brad Rowe, who plays his role very convincing, and Trevor Wright are magnificient."
4,TOUCHED,A true hartwarming story of love and affection - and what it means to be true to yourself. Truely touching...
3,sutitles?,"I wanted to watch this movie, it says it has closed caption so I wanted to watch it since I'm deaf and apparently it doesnt have closed caption (subtitles). I was disappointed but I went ahead and watched it, and the directing was awesome. I was disappointed I couldn't watch it in subtitles cuz I would really enjoy it if it was."
3,Entertaining Coming of Age Film,"Though this project is low budget and the characters and certain plot details could have been more fully explored...The acting is good, the story is compelling, the guys are cute and the issues explored are things that anyone (gay, straight, bi, transgenered) can relate to. The male leads share great chemistry; the viewer truly cares about what will happen to them and ultimately the film is empowering in that it encourages the viewer to see that he or she can choose their own path in life and that love may materialize at the most unexpected times. The soundtrack is very entertaining and it fits in nicely with the narrative and the beautiful California beaches."
4,Shelter is a breath of fresh AIR!!!!,"This movie made me wanna pack my bags, move to San Pedro, work in a greasy diner, meet a rich surfer/writer dude with writer's block, who would teach me to surf and I would become the inspiration for his next best-selling novel and we would live by the beach and wear pooka shells and nothing else!!!!!(hey a guy can dream right!???) For real though..this movie is soooo nice to look at & the characters of brad rowe and Trevor are so likeable..u find yourself constantly rooting for each of them...I loved this movie and will add it to my collection...right next to latter days!! LOL!!!!"
5,More than a gay surfer movie,"This film is so beautiful & heart warming that having hired it from the library I had to buy it (from US Amazon as there isn't one in Australia!). It will always be a favourite film of mine, not just because I can relate strongly to it personally, but because the theme of love conquering all is timeless & close to my heart. Intelligently written & acted, and beautiful cinematography, challenging society to overcome it's homophobia/general bigotry, but it has humor too... Enjoy!"
5,shelter,i like the movie alot that it was a great love story i hope everyone will watch this movie. for me it give me hope that one day i will find my love
5,Shelter,"Great Movie, not a typical gay romance type movie you'd expect to see. Came on time and in perfect condition/new."
3,"No Captions or Subtitles, but a ""Music Video"" and a ""Featurette"" Instead","Despite the Amazon listing (see ""Format"") this DVD has no closed captions or subtitles, which will be bad news for about 9 million deaf and hard-of-hearing persons in the United States who, gay or straight, might otherwise enjoy this beautiful film. No assortment of ""Special Features"" can compensate for the deficiency.This omission is especially unfortunate as it comes from Here! Films and Liberation Entertainment, producers of gay films, whose management ought to be more sensitive to other disadvantaged minorities. That Genius Entertainment also had a hand in producing this DVD may serve as a caveat. Hoping to find captions on a DVD from Genius is (as my grandfather used to say) like buying a pig in a poke. Seven out of eight Genius/Rhi DVDs that I own lack closed captions and subtitles.Federal trade laws ought to require disclosure of captions and subtitles (and the lack of them) on all DVDs sold."
3,Overpraised,"It's not a bad movie, but it's really no better than ""average."" I don't understand why it's so overpraised. The acting is pretty bad at points, and some of the writing is awful (the main character's sister is a total caricature). It's a cute gay movie with a happy ending (and, let's face it, not many gay movies actually end with ""boy gets boy""). If that's what you're looking for, you'll find this movie satisfying. But if you are looking for anything more, you're out of luck. Again, a decent movie, but nothing more than that."
3,another surfer movie....,Cute actors who do a pretty good job but the plot was way too preditable and boring.
2,totally overrated,"sometimes just the fact, that is a gay movie, I dont know why , people deciode to rated too good to be truth, this is a low budget, and low imagination, if You wanto to see it , rented it."
5,"Love this movie, one of my favorites.","There are so many parallels in my life and this film. Growing up in Southern California and struggling with many of the same demons Zach does makes this a very special film to me. The soundtrack of Shelter is just as powerful as the film itself - a must see (I even watched the DVD with my mother, lol)"
5,For the Gay Community...intensively romantic...love it…Proud to own it!,"Great storyline, great actors, and very good sets and wardrobe. The cast of actors is great! This is good entertainment for all us in the Gay community. The sound quality is good, with great cinematography. However, I recommend purchase as this movie is a rare classic and I would like to see a sequel to this movie. I don’t believe it’s available on Blue ray. It’s available on standard DVD. I love this movie so much! Thanks guys!"
5,Hits home,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's the first gay themed movie that actually seems like my life, with characters I can relate to and recognize in my life, in neighborhoods I actually know."
5,One of the best,"SHELTER has to be one of the best gay themed movies to date. None of the typical stereotypes that we normally see in movies. This is also more than a love story. It's a movie that shows how important family is. Great acting by all involved but the shining stars are Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe. Both do an outstanding job and pull you into the movie. The cinema photography is well done. If you only purchase one movie this year, make it SHELTER. It is one for the collection."
4,Well done cliché,"There's nothing new, spectacular or surprising going in 'Shelter.' In fact, the story has been put on screen many times before. Guy finds out he is gay, has trouble in accepting that for himself and his surrounding, but in the end everything turns out the way it should. Pretty thin story. Maybe especially for a Dutch guy like me. But the acting and the storyline are believable. And the actors are nice people, what makes it easy to sympathise with them. So yes, it's a cliché. But a well done one.I also liked the music in the movie very much. The Shane Mack songs as well as most of the others. That helps too.This movie came without subtitles. And that's a dissapointment for those who can't hear very well and for those who don't understand english well enough. And that's a shame. It witholds the movie from being seen by many people across this planet. Also those, to whom this story isn't so much of a cliché, but a story they live themselves."
5,Amazing Movie,Ive gotten a couple of movies on here and this by far has got to be the best gay themed movie i have boughten. The coming out story was exceptionally directed and the story line is great not to mention the astounding actors. i would recommend that everyone buy this movie.
5,UnMISSable,"What a WONDERFULLY romantic film! Like the other reviewers before me, I was besotted by the film. This is definitely one of the best gay themed movie to come in a long while. Production values, acting, actors were all top notch. Definitely something you would keep as a collector."
3,It's a good movie...cheesy...but good.,"This is kind of one of those predictable, cornball romantic movies where, as soon as you get into the plot, you can predict each following step of certain characters...granted, there isn't anything wrong with that sometimes, even here, it was still a lovely film that served it's purpose and I would recommend at least getting a used copy of and sitting down with a new boyfriend and watching it."
3,shelter,i very much enjoyed this movie a couple slow spots with thealways sleeping father and the very annoying sister but all inall an OK movie
4,Shelter,"Great Movie to see. It's about a young men trying to figure out what he wants in life, what he needs in life and what he has to do in life. Shipping was fast, and on time.Shelter"
5,"If you want a dozen, order a dozen","Shawn Alfaro says she's ""not pleased"". I'm not pleased with her review; it is based on her mistake and giving the item one star is wrong and misleading. The item she ordered was obviously for one bottleBadger Storage Bottles 3/4 oz. jar with lid fits models 100, 150, 200, and 350. The description reads ""Clear glass jar with black plastic lid"", that's ""jar"", not ""jars"". She got what she ordered and should have rated it on that basis. If she wanted twelve she should have ordered Badger Airbrush 50-0052B 3/4 oz. jar & cover 12-PK (box of 12) BADGER. They are cheaper by the dozen, but you have to do your homework."
1,i only got one jar instead of 12!!!!!!!,"i had ordered these a few days ago and instead of 12, I got 1!not pleased!"
3,Blanks 77 meets Black Flag,"and for those of you that think those bands sound the same, well, they kinda do. but this is pretty good, high energy fast-paced old fashioned street rock and roll. real low-fi production makes it sound authentic. worth a listen, and it's cheap too!"
1,Girls' Toys of the 70's and 80's,"I received this book as a gift. I had the book less than 5 minutes and wanted to return it. The book contains only a few pages from each catalog, so if you're looking for a particular type of toy, you are not assured of it being one of the ones chosen for that year. In addition, even though the original catalogs were in color, the pages in this book are an inferior quality of paper with black and white pictures...VERY disappointing. I have similar books in the same price range, all of which contain thick, full-color glossies. Overall, content and quality make me give this 1 star."
2,Disappointing quality.,"The quality of the photocopied-like pages in this book are very dis-appointing. I bought this for a gift. I found an old actual 1980's JCPenney catalog for the husband, and this new book for the wife. I am a little embarrased to give her this new book due to the low quality of the photo-copied pages and the lightness of the printing in this book."
3,Stunning music.. Poor soloists,"I disagree with the preceeding reviewer for being so hard on Tactus. I'm grateful to be able to get to known this magnificent music even if it is not a professional rendition. The mass shows the composer's skill in variety of sacred music technics. Contrapunctal sections are well done by a young choir with children sopranos? Orchestra Barocca di Cremona (on periods instruments) is playing quite good. The minus point are soloists (with exception of the tenor) whose lack of professionalism regarding early music genre is obvious. Coloratura aria sung in a very slow tempo is not a nice listening experience. Those poor soloist are responsible for much too slow tempi of some sections that break the continuity of the music. This is a LIVE RECORDING and the only one of this works so far. I have listened to it many times and every time ,using the power of imagination, enjoyed it even more."
1,Massacre of a requiem,"That Requiem is a masterpiece. Luchesi does deserve to be discovered and recorded. Alas! the very same people who pioneer in that noble challenge condemn these ""new"" composers to oblivion by providing us with a recording so lame that I consider it an insult to any music lover to merely dare putting such a horror on the market. The orchestra is barely OK and the soloists passable. The choir however is the worst I ever heard. The amateur choir of the church around the corner does a much better job!Don't waste a penny on that disc! I wish I could give it a zero star!"
5,God thinks youre positivley awsom,"I read this book as a youth teacher, preparing for a teen girls class. I found it very easy to read and the layout was great, it kept your interest and had extremely well planned and thought out topics and suggestions, this book is a great tool for teaching girls how to have a strong self asteem and feel confident about their bodies and friends i give it a thumbs up."
5,UNDERSTANDING OUR WORLD,"THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE READ THE BOOK. THE LAST TIME WAS A 110 YEARS AGO IN COLLEGE. MR. HALL MAKES US THINK ABOUT OTHER CULTURES AND ESPECIALLY OUR OWN CULTURE. IN THESE AWFUL TIMES IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND OURSELVES AND ONE ANOTHER. MR HALL'S BOOKS HELP WITH THIS. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND A CULTURE'S LANGUAGE AND DRESS. TIME, SPACE, AND OTHER CONTINGENTS ARE JUST OR MORE IMPORTANT."
5,A SOLID album...,"Some of the negative reviewers of this album need to remember that this album came out in the dark days of grunge. Hats off to Dokken to releasing an album that actually broke from the main stream of those days and ROCKED! It's not Tooth and Nail by any means, but it still rocks pretty hard. Lynch and Dokken-no matter how much you two don't get along with one another, you need be together because together you make some great music. Oh by the way, George Lynch is THE MAN when it comes to playing a six string. Get the man in the Rock and Roll HOF where he deserves to be! Dokken, Lynch, Pilson, and Brown no matter how Dysfunctional they all are need to get back together and turn out some more albums!"
3,Dokken -The 5th studio album,"I have to say that this was not a wonderful ablum as others were from years past, but it wasnt absolute garbage either. None of the songs on here are as enjoyable as 'Just got lucky' or 'dream warriors' and seem to me that they are lacking a very important element and that being energy. I know it has a lot to do with the 90's influence and the disbanding of the guys but I still dont think that should be an excuse. But on the positive side there truly are 3 solid and good songs on here including 'shadows of life', 'Too high to fly', and 'The maze'. Each song is tolerable and good in its own sense and I think that there is a possibility it could grow on me. But it did saden me because I really am a hard core dokken fan and I knew Don and the guys were capable of a better record."
4,"Dokken: Updated Sound, Same Great Band","Alright Dokken fans, let's get something straight: the music on this CD is NOTHING like what you'll hear on albums like ""Back for the Attack"", or ""Tooth and Nail"". Yes, it's still Don's voice, and it's still George Lynch behind that awesome guitar work, but the new music has a distinct '90s feel to it. It's a bit slower, and Don's voice doesn't hit those high shrieks that he used to belt out. The songs are very differently written as well. However, it's still the same band, and that's apparent by riffing of Lynch's guitar, the background voices of Mick and Pilson, and Don's voice leading you through the album. Fans of classic Dokken: Take your chances and try this one, it's different, but in my opinion still better than ""Erase the Slate""... that album wasn't bad, but the absence of Lynch really shows... Reb Beach just can't fill the shoes of that guitar hero."
3,A good piece of work,"I think that Dysfunctional is a worthy disc from Dokken. It was released in 1995 and consists of 11 tracks. The material is in a straightforward hard rock musical direction. The songwriting is solid, the musicianship is skillful, and the sound quality is tight. Don Dokken does well with the vocal duties. Examples of songs that I like are the well-written, attractive power ballad ""Nothing Left to Say,"" which contains a string arrangement, the driving ""Too High to Fly,"" and ""Hole in My Head,"" a sprightly cut that sports a beginning of sitar playing and nice harmony vocals. They also perform a rendition of ""From the Beginning""--a tune from the band ELP. The CD packaging includes the song lyrics and various photos of the guys. There is a color photo of the group on the back of the CD jewel case. The album cover is creative. The CD is just over 55 minutes. Dysfunctional is a satisfying, cohesive disc from Dokken."
5,As always we are Rocken with DOKKEN !!!,"This album not only rox , but the guys obviosly have matured musically.Even though they have split once again,goerge delivers, micks beats quiver, jeffs b-vocals rule,don well is great,but could lose that ATTITUDE!! All in All they sound extremely tight !! KEEP ON ROCKIN with ""DOKKEN"" !"
5,WHAT a comeback....,"Although the boyz of Dokken went their separate ways for 7 years, Dysfunctional shows just what GREAT musicians can do. The record is well written and George's guitar work is very ""tasty"". It's too bad that they NEVER got the deserved acclaim they deserved, because I am hard pressed to find a more talented band in the past 20 years. They are an EXCELLENT band!!!!!!!!"
4,Great introduction to statistical mechanics,"I recommend this book to anyone who is taking an undergraduate course in stat mech. I also recommend it to beginning GRADUATE students of stat mech. I used it for my own graduate coursework and I found it to be extremely helpful.This book provides a clean, uncluttered presentation of the principles of stat mech; does not lose sight of the physical reasons behind the mathematical manipulations; and most helpful of all, contains a good set of problems WITH SOLUTIONS! It has been more helpful to me in my graduate work than any graduate-level book!In a next edition, maybe the authors can include a gentle introduction to the new renormalization group theory of phase transitions, and also increase the number and depth of problems.If you plan on studying stat mech, get this book."
4,"Great for Stat Mech, Not so great for Thermo","I found this book to be a great introduction to statistical mechanics. The thermodynamic chapters (which are mostly at the very beginning and very end of the book) left a lot to be desired. The authors did, however, relate stat mech ideas back to thermo topics, which helped motivate the subject. Finally, I would not recommend this book to be used as a self-study book. I read the chapters before the lectures and found that I repeatedly needed the lecture information (i.e. info not in the book) in order to the do the homework problems."
4,Great for reviewing,"You cannot beat this book for help reviewing for prelims or comps. The problems are typical of what you would find on a stat mech prelim, and the answers are in the back of the book. Combine this with Schoeder'sAn Introduction to Thermal Physicsfor a total Thermo + Stat Mech course.The book is also very helpful during grad-level Stat Mech courses. It makes a great companion to Pathria'sStatistical Mechanics, Second Edition."
5,What a great practical guide!,"This book is a real gem -- it's short, fast-paced (every page has a new title), well written in a interesting way with lots of real-world examples, and it gives great sales advice. I couldn't put it down because I always wanted to see how the sales story came out. Then I wanted to see what the next topic was about. The best part is that it sounds so right, it has a certain ring-of-truth that when you read it you go ""you know, that's exactly right"". I found the sales advice very compelling."
5,Great resource to improve your grades,The single most important skill necessary for success in law school is the ability to write a well-reasoned essay examination. This system will guide you in how to structure your exam answers. Using this system made a big difference in my grades. I would recommend this system to all of my friends entering law school.
4,Eye-Opening Book,I was raised Catholic and am stunned by this book. The research was thorough and complete. My hope is that this book is the final chapter in a dark era for the Church.
2,Dub FX Review,There seems to be two Dub FX artists. I was looking forward to hearing the tunes of another artist: [...]Sure it's probably my fault but after looking around so much you can see how I was confused... I guess
1,not what I expected,These guys need to get a new name. Dub FX is taken. Google it to see who owns it.
2,Vocals inaudible . .,I bought Chin Up's cd . . .the songs are great . .and the vocals would be great but the they are so buried in the mix they are hard to hear. This is so annoying that I can't listen to the cd.
2,AVERAGE BRONSON FLICK,"AN EX-CON [CHARLES BRONSON] IS CONFRONTED BY HIS FORMER PARTNERS IN CRIME. WHEN THEY KIDNAP HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER, HE MUST DO EVERYTHING HE CAN TO BRING THEM BACK ALIVE. JUST ANOTHER CHARLES BRONSON MOVIE. DUE TO THE POOR PACING AND THE PREDICTABLE PLOT, IT FAILS TO MAINTAIN MY INTEREST AFTER A WHILE. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SOLID, ACTION-PACKED MOVIE, YOU WON'T FIND IT HERE. THERE IS A GOOD CAR CHASE NEAR THE END. UNLESS YOU'RE A DIE-HARD CHARLES BRONSON FAN, DON'T EVEN BOTHER BUYING THIS ONE. JUST RENT IT INSTEAD IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SEEING IT. BASED ON A NOVEL, ENTITLED ''RIDE THE NIGHTMARE''."
4,Toast MC's,"So dope it would waste most of the stuff that comes up these days.From an era when there was quality comin' out regularly, this is a shining example of real hip-hop.The jazz-bass and horn stabs + super-ryhmes on ""Hold Your Head"" = one of the nicest hard-times tracks I have ever heard. Can't get enough of that track.However, it's just my fave amongst a very strong batch of music that was (and still is) totally bangin' as when it was first released.D.I.T.C REPRESENT!"
4,"Funny, But Short","I received this book as a gag gift before I started law school. It was a neat coffee table type book for any aspiring or current lawyer. Most of the jokes aren't new. In fact, you probably already would know the setup if all it gave you were the punchlines. But its nice to have a compendium of jokes and anecdotes all in one place.What can I say? I liked it."
4,Lawyer specific,"I have dealt with my fair share of attorneys and they all seem to have a certain personality disposition. Though this book is full of jokes, I could just as easily call it a documentary. While I thought it was very funny, I can't imagine most lawyers being as amused. Please, this would make an ideal gift for any attorney if you have ever detected any of these traits: Self adoration, self importance, narcissistic, displays of hubris, arrogant, disdain for almost ALL incomptent(compared to them) attorneys, swoons over at least one Supreme Court justice(generally at the Federal level), likes US history and the Constitution and considers themself, all around, the best damn attorney this side of the mississippi."
4,Too funny,"I really liked reading the jokes, stories, & quotes in this book. I think you will too, unless you are a lawyer or live with one. Hide it from them :-p"
3,A decent gift,"My 16 month old son plays with these blocks occassionally. He finds placing the smaller boxes inside of the larger ones quite enjoyable. One problem is that it's easy to lose the final two boxes because of there size. Apart from that, they are quite durable."
1,Ugh. Yuck. Phooey.,"From the reviews I expected Flinch to be my kind of book, hard-boiled and twisty with complex characters and taut dialog.Man, was I wrong. The characters never come alive. The bloated witless dialog goes numbingly on and on. And the serial killer plot couldn't fill half a page - a guy accidentally stumbles across photos that prove who the killer is, the end.The subplots are worse. The action scenes may be some of the lamest and least credible ever written. How could anybody possibly enjoy this stuff?Avoid Flinch."
1,BORING!,"Unlike other Robert Ferrigno books. This one has no suspense, no mystery, and is extremely boring. I tried to like it but just couldn't although I struggled through to the end."
2,Talky Sibling Rivalry,"I picked this book up read a chapter or two and put it down for weeks. I only finished it because I finish 99% of the books I pick. It is just so slow moving. Every detail is chewed over by the main character until you just wish he would actually do something. Then there is a burst of violence and the book ends (thankfully). I kind of liked the female detective, she is the most interesting character, but she doesn't have much to do (like everyone else in the book). When I started the first few pages it seemed to be stream of conciousness by someone on LSD. Characters were talking to each other but you had no idea who they were or what they were doing. I skipped a few chapters and saw there was more readable narrative later on and went back and started it again and made it all the way through. It wasn't worth the trouble."
3,Smooth Writing,"The style is engaging and enjoyable, but the plot takes a long time to travel a very short distance. The author makes it easy to read, but when we're done, it's not very satisfying. Looking foward to the next effort."
3,Not that great,"There is only one sentence to read aloud per page. My mother's dementia and low vision made looking at the pictures impossible and the suggested questions in the back only irritated her. If there had been more to read to her, it might have worked out. She enjoy being read to, but not being subjected to endless questions about things that she can't remember. You might want to suggest which stage of dementia (memory challenge) this book is good for, such as early to early middle."
2,Doesn't fit like a glove,"Bag was inexpensive and gets the job done in terms of cushion and wheels. The knock is that it is bulky for my golf bag and I'm using a cart bag, not a walking bag. Would be doubly so for a walking bag. Almost as if it was not developed for a golf bag. This difffers from my previous soft bags which have hugged my clubs/bag well making it easy to carry w/ the shoulder strap. I will have to use the wheels at all times on this one. Great for a golf trip with the boys b/c you could probably fit all of your clothes in here as well."
1,Not for moles.,"Used this product just as directed on several moles, not even the slightest improvement. Maybe it works on warts and spots , but not moles."
3,"So far, nothing...",I bought this product because it is supposed to be homeopathic. I have been using it for the last 3 weeks and so far nothing ha happened yet.
1,Scame for warts and Moles,It does lighten some spots. Wouldn't waste any more money on it. Bought two jars and didn't get enough results for cost of one.
4,oil filters,"Exactly as ordered. These are hard to come by, Avalanche 2500 496 cu in 8.1 liter V8 not many around. Paid $20 for two, a bit high, but saved me from driving around trying to get them. Walmart and other discount stores don't carry them. At 10 MPG, I change both the oil and filter every 3000. If your buying the same note: the black part pictured on the filter is not there, so their is no extra guard like it implies, but these are the right filters."
4,Small Block Chevy Drag Race Engine,"This book covers virtually all facets of building and tuning small block Chevy drag race engines. Although some of the information is a bit dated, it remains one of very few sources for technical and theoretical reasoning behind what makes a drag racing small block tick."
1,The River of No Return,"The product that I received was completely worthless. It was the wrong CD and the dialogue was in a language that I do not speak or understand. I noticed immediately that the order confirmation stated that the order could not be changed. I have never received such a warning from any other provider. I am stuck with a trash CD that I can not even conscientiously donate to anyone. When I do business over the internet I accept the risk that I can be cheated.There is no way the provider confused the requested Marilyn Monroe CD with the trash they sent because of the names Asians who ""starred"" in the CD I received.I will never order from Amazon again."
3,Short on Substance!,"Better child oriented art and more detailed explanation of the various world religions would of made this book extremely valuable for children. A good, very short summary!"
2,"Great graphics, but text problematic","The intent is honorable: no doubt our children need visual aids that help make sense of diversity. But I would much rather have ignorance than misinformed opinion. The entry on Sikhism in the book is disturbingly inaccurate. Whatever little I saw of other traditions also seemed reduced to a caricature. Granted, the book is for tiny tots, but who says toddlers need to be fed misrepresented facts? In other words, does the fact that the book is for children exempt its grown-up author(s) from doing their cultural homework?Please exercise caution in representing other faiths to your children. God knows we don't need any more stereotypes than already exist."
4,Extraordinary,This is a fine book for any one interested in studying the History of Mexico and US specially back in those uncertain turbulent yet interesting days. I highly recommend this one
5,Mesmerizing...,Ottmar Liebert + Luna Negra do it again! Amazing and melodic... I think this is one of the best.Highly recommended!
3,It was better when I was a kid,This was fine. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . ..... . . . . ...
5,Great,I got the DVD early. It was in great condition and I will buy from this seller again in the future.
4,All time favorite family flick,We love these movies. They will be hours and hours of family fun for years to come.
4,funny to remember,a fun family movie to watch with my kids...they really enjoyed these.WHY don't they make movies like this anymore????!!!
3,Team on the run,"The Book shipped real fast, considering that it came from England. However I was a bit disappointed with the book's content. I guess I was hoping for some previous undisclosed reason that the team folded just when it started to look up for them. Instead, it was just poor management and an unfulfilled dream of the top dog. It did go into detail as to the workings and how decisions were made; a real inside look of a struggling team. A fast read, buy used paperback and you won't be too disappointed."
4,DID THEY LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER?,"The dish ran away with the spoon! A search is launched by the other characters in this reprise of a famous nursery rhyme. Do you remember - Humpty Dumpty who sat on a wall,- and Little Boy Blue who blew his horn, the Cows, the big bad Wolf and even the Giant and the beanstalk! Clever action emerges as the characters follow a map given to them by the Fork. They have to find the ""runaways"" so that this nursery rhyme can continue. Color illustrations enhance this enjoyable tale. When you and your children finish having fun with this cute creation, try reading, ""Where Do Balloons Go?"" by Jaime Lee Curtis, - and ""Island in the Sun"", by Harry Belafonte."
5,"* Anthropomorphic Dish, Spoon, THE WHOLE NINE YARDS ! *","Hey, diddle, diddle: What a 'Tall Tale' this is !In southern Indiana we have been celebrating such stories at a 3rd Annual TELL-OFF. The Stevens' sisters would fit right in, along with their brother Jack (GREAT PORTRAIT, that!) who plays the role of ""fixer-upper"" when the crazed DISH cracks up.Puns and ""literary"" allusions make this an entertaining read-aloud for adults who will doubtless 'catch on' to more than their young listeners.The authors embroider the original Mother Goose rhyme & the story moves briskly - - halting along the way while its sleepy characters consider their next moves in looking for the missing DISH & SPOON. Janet Stevens has provided wonderful facial expressions for her characters, PLUS athletic bods! Amusing and colorful (Reviewer mcHAIKU is envious of the FORK's Hawaiian shirt), the characters sure sound like ""down home folks"" don't they? And we look forward to Stevens & Crummels' next collaboration."
3,"Clever idea, but questionable dialogue","I agree with the other reviewers that this book has a very clever concept along with interesting use of other children's stories. I think the attitudes of some of the characters are a little bit more than ""sarcastic"" though, they are sometimes downright rude. (""Well, whoop-dee-doo to you;"" ""Don't have a cow, Cat;"" ""Cut the blah, blah, blah and get to the point!"") We don't talk to each other that way in our house, and I don't want my five year old repeating lines like this she's gotten from a book. It may be appropriate for an older child, but with a younger one, I would recommend discussing the language and attitudes displayed by the characters, pointing out that they aren't being very nice. Otherwise, you may hear them directed at you!"
4,"Cat, Dog, Cow, Spoon, And Dish Story","This story is about the Spoon and the Dish. Cat, Cow and Dog are looking for Spoon and Dish. For all of the trouble they went through, can they find Spoon and Dish? Read this story to find out!"
3,Lighthearted fun with a catch,"The first time I read this to my 4 year old, we both enjoyed the story until things got ugly at the big bad wolf's house, at which point my daughter got so frightened that we had to put the book up. However, she wanted to read it again the next night, which is a compliment to the author. I edited the frightening scene at the wolf's house and toned it down a bit, and we've enjoyed it ever since. Maybe my child is too sensitive, but I do think that the book skips along with carefree fun and the unpleasant twist detracts from the rest of the story. If your child scares easily, be prepared to paraphrase."
4,Funny story,This is a cute picture book about what happened the dish and spoon didn't come back in time for the rhyme.The pictures are incredible- what a great artist!
3,Too High Too Bad,"While i enjoy the 90's alternative/rock music scene and bands like the Meat Puppets, this album left me somewhat empty after hearing it (and not just once too). The Meat Puppets have a tremendous amount of talent but just wasn't able to showcase it on Too High to Die. The album is probably good enough from the aspect of worth buying for a few songs, especially of course ""Backwater"" which is their best song and their hit from 1994, and a song that i believe is one of the most significant songs from the 90's rock genre. The other songs on this album were too rough and very much predictable throughout. It just didn't keep me interested enough to keep it in my cd changer. With the exception of ""Backwater"", perhaps Too High to Die is an acquired sound."
5,The Meat Puppets are great.,"This is a great album. If you like it or like the Meat Pupppets, you should also check out Sewn Together. Another great album by the Meat Puppets."
5,Spectacular,"I love these guys. It's super cool that they associated with Kurt Cobain, fore the Meat Puppets music is hip and worthy enough to be played alongside Nirvana's Unplugged. That is beside the point. This is my favorite album buy the MP's."
4,Sixes Sevens and Nines,"Like a roll of dice, this release turned out to be a winner for me. Strong guitar work, and eclectic arragements, this is one of my favorite alternative bands! Lake of Fire is a classic!!!"
4,Good . . . Very Good,This Meat Puppets CD is one of the prizes of my CD collection. I just love the wonderful melodys and guitar tracks that the band has. I would strongly suggest this CD to anyone who loves good alternative rock. -David S. Kleparek
5,He's done it Again! A fabulous work,I think this guy is the most underappreciated artist on the planet today. What can I say just a tremendous work. Can't wait for the next album.
5,Just unbelievable!,"I eagerly bought this CD when it first came out because I have been a fan since Introducing the Hardline... I took it out of my case today (for some reason I hadn't listened to it in a while). It is truly one of my all time favorites. TTD (aka: Samana Maitreya- I don't get the name change, but who cares) produces great CD's. It may take the uninitiated one or two listens to get into the music, but once your there, it's great. So much better than the bland, predictable, brainless {stuff} that's put out today; TTD should get more recognition in the music world. The music has a great, funky feel to it that anyone can really get into. I love TTD's voice, too. It's very distinct and there's this quality to it that's hard to describe, almost chalky. In summary, after reading other reviews, I would say I agree with all the positive things said about this album and TTD."
3,Trying too hard,"Hmm, I tried to get into this album and it just didn't happen for me. It sounds like Terence is almost trying too hard, trying to force the music and melodies, and it doesn't quite gel. There is some real power and energy here, but the frenetic pace wears on me after a while. I keep waiting for him to take a breath and slow down and really knock me out with a delicious tune in the style of something from his debut album. Didn't happen. Okay, maybe he didn't want to repeat the same formula again, and for that I give him credit. Obviously, many other people here were impressed with this album, but I thought the quality of the songs was just not up to snuff. Terence is a talented singer and musician, but I feel he could have benefited from stronger material."
2,A Wet Firecracker,"Everything seems to point to a dynamite album, what with Phil Lesh on bass, supported by the dynamic drumming of Johnny Molo, the guitar of Warren Haynes, and lyrics by Robert Hunter. Unfortunately, There and Back Again is a pretty wet firecracker. The music seems banal, the overall sound is reminiscent of somebody trying to sound like the Allman Brothers, but without the grit and fire they had at their best. The end result is a truly unsatisfying recording that will do nothing to enhance the reputation of Phil Lesh. I find it hard to believe he would lend his name to something so musically unsatisfying."
4,Different,"The first time i listened to this cd I didn't like it. I thought it sounded too much like the Allman Brothers Band. But not until after I listened to it a few times did I realize exactly how unique this band really is. Each member of Lesh & Friends has incredible talents. The best songs are ""Midnight Train"" ""Welcome to the Underground"" and ""Patchwork Quilt"". I recomend this to anyone who is into southern rock, jam bands, or plain ol' feel good music."
3,"If You're Gonna Buy It, Buy the Limited Edition","Maybe they should have titled it ""Friends & Phil Lesh,"" because that's what it sounds like. Warren Haynes has about as many credits on the record as Phil and sings more songs. Phil, in fact, only sings lead on one. Now I know Phil doesn't have the best voice, but I love his off-key croak (remember his cover of ""Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues?""--I love that!). What we get here is second-rate Doobie Brothers/Bad Company. The band never opens up on the studio tracks. This is worth getting for the bonus CD of mostly live material--this is where Phil & Friends shine. ""St. Stephen,"" especially, is terrific. I don't think Phil should only do old Dead songs, but I was hoping for more from his solo studio debut."
2,There and DON'T come back again,"This cd is [bad], not really one truly memorable moment on it, nothing more than backround music. This one will sit in the cd collection and probably never again see the light of day. As a 30 year deadhead I have listened and enjoyed some pretty poor material, which always seemed to have at least some redeeming value, this however goes nowhere. The best part of this was the live material included in the purchase. If you want to hear good phil stuff, download his soundboard live recordings from gdlive.com. Phil should bring back Robben Ford fron his earlier tours, that guy knew how to jam. This cd doesn't have a single jam on it. I was looking forward to some high quality studio stuff, not elevator music."
4,Just as much a Warren Haynes CD as a Phil Lesh one,"Not that this is a bad thing. As a Bassist who does some harmony vocals, Lesh is not in the spotlight as often as lead guitarist and vocalist Haynes, from Allman Brothers and Gov't Mule fame. Disc one is the studio set with all new material. Haynes does a tribute to Jerry Garcia on ""Patchwork Quilt"" and it is memorable. Haynes has taken this song and done it live with Gov't Mule and the Allman Brothers and it has become of his better known songs. Disc 2 is the live set, including a lengthy Dark Star.There are 2 versions of this set sold- you can get the studio CD by itself or as part of the 2 CD set. Deadheads will definitely want the 2 CD set with the strong live jams SO IF YOU ARE GOING TOBUY IT, GET THE RIGHT ONE."
4,Blend of the Allman Brothers/Grateful Dead...,This is really a collaboration between Lesh and Warren Haynes which is the reason why this album sounds like a blend of the Allman Brothers/Grateful Dead. There is some great music here. Plus if you're a Deadhead or you're in the mood for some long jams there is a bonus 4 track disk that includes a 25 minute version of Dark Star.
3,Fun and Easy,"I thought this book was fun and was easy to follow. I was a little upset by the lack of characters in the actual book itselft, but the drawings were fine and the instructions were good."
3,Its realy easy!,"Im only ten and Im a big Zelda fan, its simple! It well is good but I get bored with it a bunch of times. Its a level three drawing book to me!"
2,Remedial,This is a VERY light book with VERY little in the way of artistic instruction. It looks like it was made on a copy machine.Child was psyched but after 20 min it was over and she was back to copying things herself from the actual art.
1,Unfulfilling,Bought this book for son who is going to college to be a video animator. He didn't like this book at all! We do not recommend spending the money on this book. Look to other books for help with art design.
1,Too much for a kid,"Let's face it,most kids that play and are obsessed with Zelda have ADHD. I thought this book would be great for a 9 yr old but the instructions were too tedious for him. He ended up getting too frustrated and has never picked up the book again. I'm sure not going to give the kid Ritalin so he can draw a fricken decu bush."
2,"That's a pity, so few tips about drawing","I'm a bit disapointed, as i wanted to know much more about link famous character drawing. Instead, whe have several characters, and less than 3 pages per each. The preview was more interesting than the whole book itself !"
3,Not Good for Older Fans or More Serious Artists,"Remember those how-to-draw books you picked-up as a kid? Like, how to draw cats, dogs, cars, trees, or whatever? This book runs in that genre. The book is very short, and was meant for children roughly 9-12. It plays heavily on the ""make it out of basic shapes, and then refine it"" technique. The first steps usually involve drawing different sets of triangles, circles, or rectangles, which eventually lead to the character you're drawing. The ""finished drawings"" aren't so hot, usually done with very thick lines all around. As said, this is better for kids. It is, however, worth picking up at the library and taking a look at, if you want. If you do like it, after sampling it, then sure, buy it. ;DThe best way to learn to draw Zelda characters, currently, is through learning anime or cartoon-animation styles of drawing, and then using official Zelda art as reference when you draw those characters."
3,Don't emember it.,"Not sure how long ago it was, but I don't remember ever buying this book. I may have looked at an excerpt."
3,How to Draw LOZ,"I had to have this for my LOZ collection - however it falls prey to the classic How To Draw book blunders in that it doesn't really provide useful instructions. It's a three step process: blocks and shapes, details, MASTERPIECE. Being a novice scrawler, I'd like to have a little more instruction and more than three steps."
4,Disney Princess Magic Talking Kitchen,"The toy was relatively easy to put together. It took about 30 minutes. The pieces fit together snugly. There are great sound effects for the tea pot boiling, bacon frying, plus lots of phrases to accompany the proper cooking segment. My 5 year old granddaughter loves it."
2,Not Durable-bad quality,"My 4 year old daughter loves every item with the Disney's princess. We got it for xmas but while putting it together, we were very dissappointed w/the quality of the plastic. This is an expensive toy and should have better material. The sounds are fun but we don't recommend it to anyone."
4,4 Year Old Loves This!,"This kitchen is too cute!! Our 4 year old loves it. We were pleasantly surprised with it's size, the sound effects, and the accessories. You don't need to buy extra accessories for your little one to play. But we did purchase a few more at nearby stores. The height of the kitchen is perfect for our daughter and it's small enough to fit in her already packed room - it's not too small where it isn't functional or boring for her either. As for the materials, it's a bit flimsy, but for the price, it's definitely worthwhile."
5,Great toy for the price!,"I wanted to get my girls a kitchen set for Christmas, but really couldn't see spending over $100 for a decent kitchen set. Since my 3 year old is way into disney princess, this was the perfect find for us. I think so far I have had more fun playing with it, then she has, but overall its a great toy! I agree with the past reviews about the batterys.. I put it all together then looked to put the batterys in and realized that it was under the castle part. Kinda frustrating, but well worth it!"
2,Bad Purchase,I bought this kitchen for my 2 year old daughter for Christmas this year. The oven door broke on the very first day she played with it. The door on the right hand side never closed properly either. One of the tea cups and one of the hooks where you can hang the phone or a kitchen utensil broke within the first month. It is made of a cheap hard plastic. Toys like this need to be ready to take a beating!! After keeping this toy for approx. 1 month I returned it to the retailer where I purchased it. I learned a lesson here.... Do your homework before making a purchase like this. I am looking for something more durable at this time.
2,Not worth it,"We bought this for my 3 year old daugther who loves the Disney Princesses. What a dissapointment. The peices do not fit together properly. After one week the voices and sounds don't work. Yes I know that is my fault for not paying closer attention when she got water in the cups and then spilled it, but her previous kitchen was waterproof and she could use water with it.This is just a poorly made product. It's adorable looking but if your going to buy your little girl a kitchen there are ones out there that are worth your money this isn't one of them."
1,DON'T waste your money!,"I bought this for my 2 year old daughters birthday and it is very cheaply made. The pieces do not connect correctly, My daughter can't open the oven door so she ends up dragging it across my floor. When I force the over open it detaches and the cabinet door just falls right off once it is opened. It is more of a pain and frustrates my child more than anything. This is defiantly not worth the money. You can buy a much cheaper one of better quality. I plan to call disney customer service and make a complaint."
2,Just OK - NOT worth the money!,"My daughter does enjoy this kitchen - however, it is NOT worth the money! Within a few days one of the knobs on the oven fell off as did the faucet for the sink. Also, it's made out of cheaper grade plastic and is not very durable. Although my daughter does have fun with the kitche, I'd definitely spend the extra money to get her a step 2 or little tikes one that is more durable."
3,Difficult Assembly,"As a father of a 5 year old and a 3 year old, I've put together several toys. This is the most difficult toy I've yet to put together. The instructions had no words, just poorly detailed pictures. I had to use a lot of trial and error to put this together, which doesn't work too well when you've got an anxious 3 year old wanting to play with it.The ""cook book"" talks when you turn the page and is supposed to talk about the recipe that is on that page but if you put the stickers on they way the instructions say to, it talks about the wrong recipe.I will say though, that my daughter has enjoyed playing with it but I think that has more to do with her than the toy. It doesn't really have anything that distinguishes itself from the other toy kitchens available. Even the fact that it's Disney Princesses doesn't distinguish it as there are several princess kitchens available."
2,Disney Magical Kitchen Isn't Magical At All,"I thought this toy would be great for our 3 1/2 year old daughter who picked it out on a recent jaunt to Toys R Us. It sits in our apartment collecting dust. She is typically a child who is imaginative and remains engaged for lengthy periods of time when something interests her and this captured her attention for all of 10-15 minutes. Now it just takes up space. Don't know how much this review will help anyone because the toy does everything that it promises and it was quite easy to assemble. It doesn't ""promise"" to engage my child which is a good thing because it falls way short of doing that."
4,my daughter the princess,i bought this kitchen for my 1 year old daughter for her birthday and she just loves it.it was well worth the 50 dollars.even her 3 brothers play kitchen with her.
4,cute & fun Disney Kitchen for toddlers,"We just bought this kitchen for our soon to be 4 year old daughter. She is delighted with it. She enjoys all the sounds and answers the princesses when they ask a question. Great for using their imagination. She gets a little frustrated though, when the doors fall off. The whole thing should be made of stronger material. It took my husband about 20 mins. to assemble and the stickers really stick in there, so make sure you position them just right the first time. Overall it is a fun kitchen for toddlers and not too bulky."
4,Really cute kitchen!,"This is the cutest kitchen and my girls love it! The details are really great and it comes with a lot of accessories. There were 2 drawbacks though- it was SO hard to put together. It took my husband 2 1/2 hours on Christmas eve to put together and it is not made that well. Overall, this one is a winner with my princess lovers!"
4,My daughter loves it!,"I purchased this as a gift for my 4 1/2 year old daughter and she loves it! The plastic is a little hard and it was a difficult to put together, it took about 2 hours but the time spent was well worth it. My only complaint is that the oven rack keeps falling off. After 3 months she still plays with it everyday. It has survived my daughter and a very active 3 year old that wanted to cook and wash herself with it. Overall, I think this was one of the best additions to my daughters toy collection."
3,Autumn's Mom,"We bought this for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves the kitchen. It does make great sounds. She likes hearing the princesses talking to her. The quality and durability not so great! Hard to put together, the pieces don't fit properly. Disappointed in the quality of Disney products!"
3,Cheaply made,"Toy didn't go together well, doors fall off, and the seams don't match up very well. What a pain to put together! 2 year old daughter enjoys and is entertained with this toy though."
3,Cute kitchen but disappoitned,"The kitchen is adorable, and everything a little girl would want. It says cute things, and great for pretend play. However, in a parents eyes, it is made so cheaply and 3 things have broken on it in the 3 months we have had it. The company was very good w/ replacement parts, but it shouldn't be happenning.Also the tray in the oven constantly falls off and my daughter is constantly asking me to fix it for her. When we first got it, the oven door wouldnt stay closed also. Then they sent us a new latch.All in all, I wish it would be a little more durable"
2,very unstable to put together,"At first I was more anxious than my 3 yr. old daughter to get the kitchen. But when I finally brought it home and saw how many pieces it brought I just thought to myself this was going to be a project. No lie it took me just about 3 hours to put ths thing together, I was so upset and aggravated by the time I was done."
2,This Toy Was Very Cheaply Made,"The Princess Kitchen is very cute but not very durable. The doors are always falling off. Everytime my four old trys to play with it she breaks something and my husband has to fis it. The oven door never stays on and she even broke the window out of the door. I would not buy it again, I should have gone with the little tykes kitchen."
4,horse whisperer,Loved this older film .. I have seen it several times since receiving it and it is a magic film. In the same dvd there was also Mr. Hollands opus another wonderful film . Thank you Mr. Amazon .
1,Warning,"Pretty good book, but many of the explainations for the code are said to be on the author's website, but this website no longer exists, and I could not find any web presence of this author any longer."
2,"Good Premise, not much else.","This book has a lot of quick tips which are fairly useful and good to know, but when it comes to the examples and code given, assumes a great deal.The disclaimer at the beginning says ""if you're a complete newbie with Actionscript, you should put this book down before you hurt yourself"", and yet those readers comfortable with the pace of the authors' notes and coding are probably not going to need the book in the first place.Which leaves those interested 'newbies' reading from a book filled with hastily written tutorials and a lot of 'attitude'. Leave this one alone."
2,disappointing,"I loved Dan's Flash 5 and MX ""Actionscript in action"" books ! It was compact and precious references.But I'm disappointed with his last book as it hardly target intermediate level users. Too many chapters and too many trivial code descriptions.Better wait for an ""MX 2004 AS in action""."
5,Thank God for Blue Roses!!,"I ordered the album to replace a copy (on cassette) stolen from me at summer camp seven summers ago. The music (I just listened to the samples on this site) is every bit as lubricious and implacably witty as I remember! Funky! Spunky! Sparks in the dark! It's one of those albums that you NEED if you want to have a complete off-the-beaten-track late-80s early-90s campy alterna-gal collection. Black Sky is very R.A. WIlson, and the whole thing sounds like a soundtrack to Susie Bright, Anne Rice, John Waters, and classy indie leather stripclubs... delightfully lucreous..."
5,The Best Music Ever,"This is the best CD of my 2587 CD collection!! I can't believe that this group wasn't nominated for a Grammy or something because they are the best EVER! These songs are a little slice of heaven, the lyrics move me everytime I play this beautiful CD. Ever since 2/19/92, I have had this CD in my Sony 5 Disc Turntable and my life has been changed dramatically. My third wife loved the CD so much we named our daughter Shakespeare's Sister Jones. Please buy this CD now, you won't regret a second of it!! Moonshine could be the best song since ""867 5309"", but I don't know."
5,Enchanting sacred songs from the French early baroque period.,"Lully wasn't a French composer, but he became so closely associated with the Sun King Louis XIV that he virtually came to be associated with French early music.William Christie is a French baroque specialist in works by Lully, Rameau, and others. This Petit Motet is his more recent production.These small motets are sacred in nature sung in small ensembles. THe performance here is serene and offers a harmonious atmosphere so sadly lacking in later works.I wonder why ""Chant"" could reach a star-status sales level while beautiful works like these 'Petit Motets' did not receive one single review over the past two years?"
3,grab the tissue box for this one,"I agree with several of the other reviewers about this book, yet I teetered on giving it four stars for tugging at my heart strings. Like Tempting Fate, this book made me cry and feel for the characters.The down side of the book is that there is very little suspense and no mystery at all. There is no surprise ending and no twists and turns. However, if you are just looking for an emotional read in the contemporary romance genre than you will enjoy this book, but maybe you should check it out from the library instead of buying it."
5,"If you love Meryl Sawyer books, you'll love this one!","Great story! I am a big Meryl Sawyer fan and this book was one of her best. She writes so perfectly that you feel like your in the book with the characters. Her relationships in the book are real, not the mushy, love-sick kind. You feel that the people in the book are real and you can relate to their emotions. The suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat and you never know how it will end. I would greatly recommend any of the Meryl Sawyer books I have read. (Hideaway, Tempting Fate, Last Night) She is truly a master of romance and intrigue."
2,A Comic Book of a novel,"Even for a fan of the genre, this book scrapes the bottom: 2 dimensional caricatures march through the bare bones of a cliched plot to the predictable conclusion. I'm ashamed I took the time to read it through- I'd have been better off watching reruns of Hogan's Heros, laugh track and all."
5,An enjoyable read.,"If action is what you want, this book delivers. Fast-paced, with a lot going on. It also touchs on some issues that are important in our present world and the author has done his research in presenting these. This weapon's system really does exist and that should be scary enough. Contrary to what many people believe, the world has not become a safer place now that the Cold War is over-- nuclear proliferation and the desire to use nuclear weapons as a political bargaining chip has made things more dangerous than ever before."
5,FAST PACED AND EXCITING,I liked the action in this book and the political shenanigans in the background were intriguing. What price did we pay for the Israelis staying out of the Gulf War? If we played a nuclear shell game during the Cold War why do we think it's over now? Dalton is a pen name for the guy who wrote THE LINE and THE GATE which also had lots of action and intriguing premises behind them. Of course he wrote those under a pen name too-- I knew him when he was in 10th Group with me at Ft Devens-- Bob Mayer. Loved his Riley series.
4,A book full of mystery and intrigue but very predictable.,"An intense, military thriller, The Omega Missile was a fun read. It had the right amount of technical aspects and brilliantly showed in depth of how launching a nuclear weapon is not just someone pushing a button. Although parts of the plot were extremely predictable, it did demonstrate how politics affect even the truest intentions, as shown by the characters dialogue and actions. Anyone interested in a highly technical military read should seriously consider reading this."
2,Mind Candy,"I purchased this book because the reviews from the latest Tom Clancy novel mentioned this book as a good alternative to the somewhat disappointing Clancy effort. I purchased the novel and read it quickly. Overall the story was simplistic and thouroughly unbelievable. This book was only slightly better than a James Bond novel for relating reality to a action/thriller. The concept was weak, the research limited and the dialogue was so predictable I winced. While it was a good read, it did not create any sense of sympathy or empathy for the characters and the two ""bad guys"" were stereotypical and had such a lack of depth that their actions seemed nonsensical. I would expect a high school student to consider this a good book, any more experienced reader would consider this book, simply ""MIND CANDY"""
3,Does not taste like the coffee I had in Ethiopia.,"I was dissappointed that this did not taste at all like the coffee I had in Ethiopia. I have bought Ethiopian coffees here in the states at coffee shops that are wonderful, there is a distinct flavor Ethiopian coffee has that this did not. It was a good tasting coffee, but NOT the Ethiopian coffee I had hoped for."
5,Quick and Insightful,"Robert Waterman, the quieter co-author of In Search of Excellence, highlights ways to make organizations hum. The Adhocracy is organized around solving problems and gettiing results, not functional organizations. The concepts precede the re-engineering craze, and are compactly written and easily accesible for any reader."
4,Betrayed! an eye opener for a Seeker of the truth!,"A Jewish family, that is confronted with their college age daughter discovering and converting to a belief in Jesus as the Savior! why trying to obtain facts from research of the Christian bible, and other materials,, to dissuade his daughter, The author and his wife become a believer of Jesus themselves! well researched on jewish and christian faiths of the early church. Most early Christian were jews, not Gentiles!, a fact I did not know, but went back and confirmed for myself, If you have questions along these lines, this book is a powerhouse of that knowledge! Knowledge is the best way to overcome preconcieved ideas, and this book is a good example. This Author became a Pastor and is active today in his 80""s."
2,the author: secular and emotional,"My friend lended this book to me, describing the story in this book as an example that a Jew converted from Judaism to Christianity. However, it is not like that at all. When you read the book, you'll find out that the author had never read the Bible and didn't even believe the existence of God before he became a Christian! It's obvious from the book that, before he converted, he had minimal knowledge about Judaism. Furthermore, when you read the story, you'll find that the author was very emotional. His main concern was the unity of family rather than truth. His reasoning was very superficial and not convincing at all. I was very disappointed."
1,A sad book,"This is a very sad book. Stan Telchin, his wife and children grew up with very little Jewish education. When Mr. Telchin's daughter is converted to a 'Messianic Jewish' faith, neither she nor her family is able to effectively counter them. It is too bad that the Telchins did not go to see a competent rabbi (are the 'rabbis' he went to real people?) and learn something about the beauty and essence of his own faith. This book is a warning to all those Jewish parents who do not give their children a real Jewish education and training in how to combat these missionaries..."
5,Very Informative and Insightful,"This book was recommended to me by a Jew who came to faith in Christ. I was looking for books that explained Christianity and Judaism from the perspective of a Jew, not a Gentile. It has a good bibliography also."
5,Excellent,"This book was recommended to me by a friend and was a great inspirational, insightful book. How much I learned from reading and looking up references as I read. I would recommend this book to everyone!"
4,Excellent book,"I really enjoyed this book. I would suggest anyone who is considering conversion read this book. I also found another great book you should think about reading if you are considering converting or strengthening your faith. It is entitled ""The Enlightenment, What God Told Me After One Million Prayers, a Message for Everyone"" by John H. Eagan. This book will bring you closer to understanding who God is and what the meaning of your life is."
4,Great value for the money,You can't beat this deal. I received all 12 episodes of this interesting serial for about $6 total. Lugosi is his usual self despite the moratorium on horror movies that was in place at the time this was created.
3,What did he say?,"Love the music. But as usual with all WP CD's, I can't understand what in the world the lyrics mean. Ruins it for me."
2,WSP searching for who they are and seem LOST,"I agree WSP is no longer a GUITAR BANDI have been a fan since '93 and have been to over 200 liveWSP shows. This band used to be about extend guitar jams andwonderful melodic guitar riffs. With lyrics that were heady and heartfelt. How can a band with 2 drummersand 2 guitar players sound so flat and lifeless. JBs vocalare over produced and unatural sounding. The lyrics are cheesy(way to much piano, horns and overproduced singing)Save your cash and buy something else. This CD is 1 star but I gave an extra since I have been a deadicated fan for 13 years"
1,WSP is no longer a guitar band !!!!!,"WSP is no longer a guitar band !!!! This CD proves that.Very soft, no edge and very commercial sounding.Very boring and lifeless.If your looking for that true sound of WSP check outMichael Housers SAND BOX > it rootsy, southern soundhits home and gives you that warm feeling inside."
4,1 wedding,"I love the cd. It needed cleaning when it arrived, but now works great. It came sooner than predicted and was so inexpensive that I can't complain!"
4,this one is different from the other Brant Bjork's,"Just a heads up to potential buyers: This album is trance-like repetitive music with an overdubbed guitar making nice little interjections. It's very cool; dreamy, groovy, mostly instrumental and laid back. There are two mid-tempo rockin' tunes to break things up. So why the ""heads up?"" Well.... the other Brant Bjork albums are not like this one. All his other output is more Kyuss-like; more upbeat with vocals. I love this album, but I guess the record company doesn't share my enthusiasm, as ""Jalamanta"" is currently out-of-print and selling for a ridiculous 40 bucks, and all the other BB solo albums are selling at regular price. WHY ?"
4,I guess it's time to put the drummer jokes to a rest...,"I just purchased this record yesterday, and I haven't really had the time to fully assimilate it, but it's obvious that it's quite good and that Brant is very, very talented. This stuff is mainly 'mood music'. You can definitely have sex to some of it, but not in a Barry White kind of way. A lot of it is very heavy and dark but is not supremely distorted. It's really good. What else is there to say?"
4,"Not Fu Manchu, but Still Good","This is very good music, although this is not exactly Fu Manchu or Queens of the Stone Age or whatever, because this is a complete drumming record. It is a good thing Brant Bjork put this out, because otherwise, there would be no eclectic stoner rock and it would have all stayed the same. There are no wild guitar solos on this album, just quiet comceptual drumming from the Fu Manchu drummer. Very Dreamy. The best songs on here are Too Many Chiefs... Not Enough Indians, Sun Brother, and Defender of the Oleander. I really do not like this as much as Fu Manchu, but this is good for quiet nights in the desert. For fans of Unida and John Paul Jones' solo outing Zooma."
2,"Five stars, not two.","I wrote a review a while back stating that this album bored me, etc. Shame shame shame. After listening to it more over time, I realized that in order for this album to be properly enjoyed, it has to be listened to in the right context. By that, I mean it's best enjoyed on a lazy, sunny afternoon or evening, when you're feeling chill and haven't a care in the world. By that merit, I love this album, but it really takes a lot of getting used to, more so than any other album I've owned. That is probably because this is easily the most unique album I've owned. Five stars for this album, Amazon wouldn't let me change my rating!"
5,"Takes time, but solid gains!","This product takes a while, and in most cases requires you to take 2 or 3 capsules daily to ensure growth; however, after taking this product for two weeks, you really start to see results. I grew my arms by an inch and a half, my incline DB bench press went from 80s to 90s, and my abs started to get more solid. Then again, I spend 5 days a week in the gym... I would say, if you are serious about staying in shape or getting stronger/more cut, definitely invest in 3 bottles per purchase on this stuff, and cycle properly."
4,works great,"yooo.... i am already very sexually active but since i started taking tribulus this thing has driven up my sex drive lol... i dont know if its my mind playing tricks on me or not but every hot girl i see making a sexual funny noise i just want to get with them on the spot at my college lol when you build your testosterone levels ""male hormones"" up its a great building block for growing muscles."
1,Why No USA format?,"Bunny and the Bull ( Bunny & the Bull ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom]I'm a big fan of British humor and would love to watch this at home on my DVD player.Unfortunately, I'm in the U.S. and can't view PAL format recordings.Sure hope to see this on a DVD that plays on USA format.The worlds getting smaller everyday, why can't we just get a universal format DVD ?I thought the digital age would have fixed all this.Would it me worth it for me to buy a PAL DVD player ? would it even work with my TV ?"
5,Not a Disappointment to Discword Readers,"This lavishly illustrated book was an absolute delight to read through. The story is up to Terry Pratchett's normal Discworld standards, although shorter by a good half or more. He did this by using fewer secondary and tertiary characters than he uses normally. Few new characters are introduced, and those were more of the supporting variety. Also, there are fewer references to a framing event or theme (that he often uses to parallel or heighten the events in the main plot). The structure is a little shallower for these omissions, making me think that this book might have started as another books B plot before he decided that didn?t do it justice, and became a shorter than normal A plot. But Mr. Pratchett needed the room, and the time you?ll spend looking at Paul Kidby's excellent artwork will make this book just as engaging as any of the other Discworld books (pay special attention to the pages from the notebook of ""Leonard of Quirm"")!"
4,A new direction?,"This was something of a surprise to me. I knew that Pratchett was beginning to get bored of the Discworld novels, but there was little way that he could just drop them; I expected some sort of departure for the series, but this was a little more radical than i expected. It's fantastic though- a shorter, but just as impactful, storyline, backed up by some of the most amazing fantasy artwork I have ever seen, almost remeniscent of the original, hardback version of Eric. Inevitably, however, this is a supliment to the canon, but not a replacement to the old-fashioned novels. An excellent one-off, and hopefully someday a collector's item, but I hope this will not be what the future holds for the Disc."
4,The Last Hero,It was given as a gift to my son and he was thrilled to have his own copy. My husband and 2 sons love the Discworld Series and it gives them lots to talk about.
4,great beach reading,"I am a great fan of Terry Pratchet , especially of his Discworld series. That is to say that my opinion is a touch biased in his favour. However, I found 'The Last Hero"" to be the ultimate beach side reading, especially when one contemplates about the ""follies' of her/his youth.Mind you that I enjoyed the book sprawled in the sands of Antiparos ( a tiny Cyclades island next to Paros - just google it)and even if someone considers it ""mass written- just another one Discworld novel"" , it makes you take a good look at your potentials. Because gods , any gods, are nothing but our conceptions and therefore they are liable to regular updated versions of their faiths.I hore that you will enjoy it."
5,entertainment from Terry Pratchett,"My librarian pointed me toward Terry Pratchett's books a year or so ago and I have enjoyed every one that I've been able to get my hands on. If you like a humorous, irreverent approach to science and magic; if you enjoy satire; if you like being surprised by a twist of phrase, you will enjoy Terry Pratchett's works in general and this one in particular. The artwork by Paul Kidby enhances the story--I HAD been wondering what Mad Hamish and the rest of Cohen, the Barbarian's ""boys"" look like and now I know.The storyline is a quest in reverse as Cohen, the Last Hero of Discworld, attempts to return that which the First Hero stole from the Gods. To say more would ruin the story, so I'll leave it at that."
3,"Not bad, for exploitive fluff.","The wizards are requested by Lord Vetinari to stop the band of elderly heroes led by Cohen the Barbarian, who plans the ultimate adventure: attacking the gods' home at Dunmanifestin. Rincewind naturally gets roped in and sent off on another suicide mission that borrows too much fromThe Light Fantastic: A Discworld Novel. Capt. Carrot, Leonard da Quirm, Ponder Stibbons, and a few others have roles too. Only the witches and Vimes are conspicuously missing from the regular characters.It's a short story, but nicely illustrated by Paul Kirby. Clearly dashed off without as much thought or depth as Pratchett's best novels. It's more a framework for the pictures than anything else. If that warning annoys you, you might not appreciate it; but if you just can't get enough of Discworld, go for it."
4,Short but entertaining and fantastic illustrations,"This story is not as long as most discworld novels and it is not his best story, but it is in the typical Pratchett style. I enjoyed it (3 stars). The fantastic illustrations are worth a 4th star. You should have it in your Pratchett collection."
1,mondo dorko,"my boss (a candlemaking, jeff foxworthy listenin' to dweeb extreme) lent me his copy of this book to read. He said, in his creepy falsetto cyber geek voice ""oh! terry pratchett does good parody, read this if ya' wanna have a lark!"" I basically had to read it, cause when I gave it back to him after a week, you know, I had to know what was in it cause he's the type of insecure dork that will ask you all sorts of questions to try and make you feel bad for not sitting around all day and reading his brand of dorky fantasy. anyways, I felt robbed of the 45 minutes I spent reading this garbage. Yeah, okay, parody of modern world dressed up in dungeons and dragons. Who cares?? even the artwork is piss poor. I proudly didn't finish it. when he asked me why, I told him the truth-I decided to go hang out with my girlfriend instead. very stupid waste of life. buy a subscription to swank instead."
4,"2 stars for the story, five for the illustrations","It's not Pratchett at his best, or even at his averagest... In places, it's almost not Pratchett at all. The story limps along like a wounded dinosaur, sometimes struggling to remind the reader what's going on. I admit to dozing off several times - unlike other Terry Pratchett stuff, which usually has me howling on the floor.In recompense, Paul Kidby's illustrations are superb and they alone make this book worth buying. As one reviewer pointed out, there's a rapport between Discworld readers and the characters and, even allowing for a less-well-told story, that rapport is guarded by the visual descriptions.Grat pictures... pity about the plot."
3,"Ordinarily I'm a HUGE fan of Terry Pratchett, but....","..this book was a real disappointment.Both tedious *and* confusing --bad combination for a novel. The artwork is fabulous. That's why I gave it three stars, also the characters are wonderful. But Pratchett has already given us better portraits of those characters elsewhere. The blueprints and anatomical studies are interesting enough. But I kept searching for a real story, and that was thin on the ground. Yeh, a bunch of them are going to the mountain, and a bunch of others want to stop them. Eh, so what?I got as far as I could in this book, until I realized I'd rather do something else, like sort my laundry. Considering how I usually treasure Terry Pratchett's books, reading them over and over, this one was a real let down for me."
5,Great Story/Book,I enjoyed this book very much. It is a definate keeper. I liked it alot more than the sequel to it LADY RECKLESS. And I had a hard time putting it down.
2,Item had about 15 bent pages,"I got the item and the packaging was great! However, the book itself, although touted as new, had about 15 bent pages....not slightly bent at the corners, but crushed and folded like origami. I returned the book.Amazon's packaging was great. This clearly happened BEFORE the book was shipped."
1,It keeps getting worse,"You'd think a company like Amazon.com would improve it's customer service over time, but in their case, they're getting worse. It's been well written by frustrated customers how this falsely advertised disc caused so many problems for folks. Now it seems Amazon has decided to also change it's payment options without notice. I won't go into detail because this has caused me enough time, & head space, but they could use a lesson on what customer service is all about. I see the disc is still being advertised; how's that for the voice of the customer?"
5,"Finally, the REAL DEAL!","The mp3 download is the original classic 1970 studio album. I've been waiting for the cd release of this and I don't mind having to get it in this format, as long as I've got it. It's the music that counts, in my opinion."
1,Welcome to the club,"If you ordered the other Hello I'm Johnny Cash & received this one instead you have my deepest sympathy. This isn't a bad cd & deserves more than 1 star but if you thought you were getting ""Southwind"", ""Devil To Pay"", & ""To Beat The Devil"" this doesn't measure up!The way things are going we will have a good sized club soon. Check reviews for the other Hello I'm Johnny Cash."
5,Johnny Cash at his best!,"Though I have always liked Johnny Cash for myself, I purchased this album for a friend. I found it to be in excellent condition and was able to make a CD for my friend, and it's very good quality, as advertised."
1,Not What You Think,"As others have noted, this is not the very worthwhile 1970 release, but an identically-titled shoddy hodge podge from the '90's. The confusion is compounded by Sony's continuing refusal to reissue the 1970 album, which has never been available on CD. Wait and buy the 1970 album if it's ever reissued, but even completists should skip this one.As of this date, Amazon has been informed and has acknowledged that the song titles listed under this entry are incorrect but has, so far, not taken down the listing or corrected the songs. This is disgraceful."
1,another disappointed customer,"I also ordered this cd & received ""the other"" Hello, I'm Johnny Cash. I think Amazon needs to straighten this out. I would ask this much:1) Tell us if you have in your inventory The Hello I'm Johnny Cash cd that is advertised here with the songs that are listed in :see track listings?2) If not please delete it!3) If you do have it devise a way for customers to be assured they will get the cd they order."
3,I recieved a best of instead,"I recieved a best of instead of the classic Hello I'm Johnny Cash album which is what I expected. I honestly don't think that Hello I'm Johnny Cash, the early 70's classic album was actually released. This is a best of early 60's tunes which you can get anywhere. I agree with above review that the hello' I'm Johnny cash album with Devil to pay, etc. is a classic one of his best, but this is not that album. Once again I repeat that Cd has not been released"
1,Disappointed,"Twice they have sent me the wrong CD. They keep sending out the Priceless Collection Hello I'm Johnny Cash. This is the same as the 1995 Sony Hello I'm Johnny Cash which has 14 different tracks. Unfortunately that is not the Original ""Hello I'm Johnny Cash"" which is the one above. Still hoping to get the Original because it has some great songs on it."
4,Not the Original - But Good Anyway,"This is not the ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash"" album originally released in 1970. This is a collection of Cash favorites released by Sony in 1992. A common error concerning this CD.However, the music is excellent if you're an old Johnny Cash fan as I am. All of the tracks are songs that were recorded under the Columbia label (none of the old Sun stuff here!). From ""Don't Take Your Guns To Town"" (from Cash's first Columbia sessions) to ""Man In Black"" (from the first release following the end of Cash's TV show in the 70's), you'll find a diverse selection of Johnny's best."
4,A Good Resource for the Toolbox,"An up-to-date NEC book is essential if you don't have everything from the code memorized. This handy book covers all of the basics for residential wiring. Even if you have some general guides on wiring (and there are some good ones out there), and you are a weekend warrior, you really must have the code handy. (A hint...read it BEFORE you start the job! I've ripped out a few jobs after discovering my work didn't pass code.)This book is also helpful when the inspector drops by for a friendly visit. Point out in the book what you understood from the code. You'll have something more than your gut instinct to back you up on your job.My only quibble is the book only hits 90% of the code. There are some important details you're going to have to consult the big code book on every once in a while. Otherwise, an excellent tool to go along with the voltage tester.Highly Recommended."
4,Great pan,I got this after wanting to try a new method to pizza baking from what my mom uses which is a baking tray/cookie sheet.Its worked fine and was a perfect pizza!Great buy if you get two of the medium size and can do two pizzas at a go .Happy pizza baking.Also the non stick ones are fine too.Ms Tan CA.
2,Not what I anticipated,I have been somewhat disappointed with this album as the first track offered no indication as to the balance of the album. While I have no regrets at having purchased the Louis Armstrong track the others are less appealing
2,Who is Francis Bryan? Why do you Care?,"In ""The Curse of Treasure Island"" Francis Bryan- whoever that may be- has crafted a sequel certain to please hordes of Stevenson fans, and infuriate just as many more. Some will appreciate the opportunity to sail once again with such favorite characters as Jim Hawkins, Ben Gunn, and Long John Silver, while others (and I must include myself in this category) will find the revival of these classic characters almost sacrilegious.In novels such as this, an author will customarily throw in everything up to, and sometimes including, the kitchen sink, to titillate fans of the original work. ""Bryan"" proves no exception..."
4,Great gadzooks!,"Great songs run through a filter of eccentric genius. Very timeless arrangements, utilizing instruments like xylophones, accordions and squeak toys. Quite lovely and undeniably French."
2,ok,"This is a simple product that is easy enough recommended to others to use, since it is doing what it is supposed to and doesn't have any visible physical defects."
5,Wonderfully Creative,"This baking set along with the toaster and the blender by Kidkraft have kept my four year old and my 1 1/2 year olds' attention every day since we have had it. They never seem to get bored with these sets as they have with other brands. These products are well made and have enabled my kids to really be creative when playing restaraunt or house. They are by far the best ""play"" cooking sets we have owned - and we have had MANY! I do recommend supervision for children under three because the products are wood and somewhat heavy. Really a lot of fun!"
2,Cheapo!,"For $5.98 list, perhaps this is all one can expect. While it is called Super Hits and covers his original signage with Columbia Records, it is missing his most significant hit from that period, ""She's Crazy For Leaving.""The songs on here are good, but it's a severely compromised disc of ten songs. There are better choices, though a little pricier that cover this period of his career.For all Rodney's talents, he's never had a record label that has been too gung-ho about supporting him. Meanwhile, they keep pushing the Music Row fluffs on us."
5,Great Import,I came across Paul Weller while looking for something else. He is a great British singer.Paul Weller is a master of the blues combined with rock.
3,Not the best show on Cartoon Network. That honor would have to go to....FAMILY GUY!!,It isn't all that bad and Starfire is a hottie.Alfred Arlen Liquor Kansas Fiddlesticks and QUINN!
3,"Respectable, but not up to par with DCAU","Teen Titans and The Batman are Warner's attempt on creating a new DCAU (DC Animated Universe). The show is ok, but the style and writing is nowhere near as good as the original DCAU (Batman, Superman, Batman Beyond, Justice League, The Zeta Project, and Static Shock). Although Teen Titans was recently cancelled, it is very sad that the original DCAU is being replaced by such childish dribble as this and The Batman."
5,Fantastic for 8-year-old,"Our 8-year-old daughter loves superheroes, and this DVD totally delights her. The characters are interesting, and there's genuinely funny parts (she laughs hysterically at some parts). Recommended to fans of Kim Possible. Teen Titans is a little more violent than Kim, but it's still age-appropriate."
1,"""Cure"" worse than the disease","The authors last told us how the value code had been cracked by companies like eToys, idealab!, and Compaq. Specifically, how these new economy companies had figured out how to create enduring shareholder value by satisfying their customers, employees, suppliers. This was obviously written before their value code hypothesis was invalidated by the market.Oops.Now, they're offering similar medicine for the health care sector.I've read the book, and my advice for all is to be certain and receive a second opinion."
5,just correcting something,"This album is great, the person above has written all that needed to be written, hehe. I'm just saying that in the end of ""Samba de Maria Luiza"" Jobim's daughter says: ""again, again!"" and then he says ""don't speak or it will be recorded!"" (and it was ;) hehe).So, that's it :)I recommend this album!"
4,Husband from Hell,"This is the first book that I have read by Lisa Gardner. I enjoyed reading it, and hope this is a good example of her work. It's easy to get into from the beginning, unlike some books that I have read and holds you to the end. It has several twists along the way that are unexpected. Worth the time it takes to read it!"
1,the perfect husband,"A bodice-ripper masquerading as a police procedural. Have enjoyed many others by Gardner, this one's just annoying. Idiot damsel in distress, overemotional prose, cartoon characters. Skip it."
1,not perfect,"The first half of the book kept me reading and then it went all downhill. All the police, local, state or FBI, are incable of doing their job. I sure wouldn't entrust them with guarding someone I loved. The ""hero"" just isn't.The killer seems to be everywhere and does things that would require several helpers and a bit of magic all while going 56 hours without sleep.The worst part of the book was the death of Marion. She was just begining to cope with her deamons and there was good book in her future story.There are so many good reads out there don't waste your time on this one."
3,Disturbing story but doesn't flow well,"I enjoyed the concept of the story of a frightened woman trying to take charge of her life in preparation for a meeting with her serial killer psycho husband, but I found the realtionship between Tess and JT to be pretty shallow and odd. I find it hard to believe that a woman with such a background of violence in relationships would be attracted to a hot-headed drunkard mercenary. I also felt that although the plot could have been really great, that the characters were not developed enough for the reader to care too much about their fates. In short, a decent read but don't expect too much"
2,Disappointed,"I love the DD Warren series. I read all the books and then started this one. It's disappointing. I don't know if it's one of the author's first books or what, but it really reads like a Silhouette romance with some crime thrown in here and there. I don't like the heroine of the story (she's just weak and unlikeable) and I don't like the guy who is helping her (he's a brute and an alcoholic.) Just not the author's best work.I might try one more book in this series, but if it's like this one, I guess I'll just wait for the next DD Warren book to come out."
2,Ok,"Lots of cheesy parts, but a good storyline. The last chapter redeemed this book to a 2 star... I will not finish this series."
4,this book is a keeper,"I read a more recent book by this author first and liked that one enough to go out and find the others by this auhor and this was the first one of the old ones I've gotten to.This book was great. It wasn't flawless - the hero and one of the ""secondary"" characters were brother and sister and while I appreciate that they had to have a history to be who they were in the book, I did get a little bit tired of being constantly bombarded with hints and reminders of why they were who they were. (does that make sense?!)Bottom line: Did I like this book? Yes.If I lend this book out, do I want it back? Yes.Am I going to read the hardcover by this author I bought before reading this book or will I return it? I'll read it."
4,Very Good Read!,"If you're looking for a supsense novel - you will enjoy this book. I saw the reviews on Amazon and decided to take a chance. I was glad that I did! You can't help but fall in love with Tess (Theresa) and J.T. The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars, was because some of the story line with Marian (the sister) and the two elderly ladies moved a little slow. In the end, both of these plots paid off nicely. The beginning is great, the middle gets a littel slow, but keeps your attention. Then as you get 2/3 of the way done, you will not be able to put this book down. Be prepared for a long night if you pick up this book!"
4,not so perfect,"I have read alot of Lisa Gardner books and have liked them tremendously. This book had it moments although I found alot of flaws in the story. The concept if very interesting and most of the time moves at a rapid pace. Other times you just want to flip thru the pages to get to the more interesting and exciting parts. It's like a see saw ride. On the whole it was a good book, not a great book. If you have extra time read it, but if you have more interesting books read this last."
5,The Perfect Husband,I purchased this book from Amazon for my Kindle on the advice of my sister-in-law. This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time.
3,AN Excellent Read,WOW! I have not read a good suspense thriller in a long time. I could not put this book down. Its a great read and I recommend it for anyone who likes to keep on their toes throughout a book!!
3,not bad,"The story was a bit different than some of the repeated storylines I have been coming across lately and it kept me reading. I'm a big mystery thriller fan and its amazing what's being published these days that makes the best seller lists. This wasnt bad for strictly quick entertainment material. I didnt mind the characters but I must agree that I found the development of the relationship in the novel a little hard to understand considering Tess, the heroine, was used to abusive men all her life. Although playing down the sub-story of the brother/sister relationship and playing up the Jim character would have made a more solid story, I found the sub-story interesting anyway and it kept me interested. I think I became more interested in finding out how the sister/brother relationship developed than the main storyline. Like I said, not fantastic but not a bad story."
1,Wow. This is terrible.,"I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when our ""hero,"" the man who is supposed to train the heroine and help her defend herself against her abusive husband, exhibited all the signs of an abusive man.Note to author: It isn't sexy or romantic or exciting when a man constantly and aggressively presses himself against a woman. It isn't believable that a woman who had suffered constant and horrifying abuse at the hands of her husband would return a forced kiss. The way the initial scenes between these two characters were written was positively vomit-inducing. Lazy writing, straight from the handbook of the bodice-rippers, but with an extra dose of violence.Rape culture, in a nutshell. What a piece of crap."
2,I swear I tried!!!,"I tried to get through this book. I swear I did. I was told it would get better. It didn't. I had to skip two or three chapters because I was so bored and tired of reading about these unmotivated characters. It just didn't seem real to me. It seemed forced and uncreative. The ""love story"" was unrealistic in my opinion. Nothing about this book appealed to me."
2,Gratuitous violence/phony romance novel,"When I started reading this book, I thought the writing was almost poetic for a crime story, but it quickly deteriorated into a crime-filled romance novel where ""true love"" happens in a few weeks under highly unlikely conditions.True, it is suspenseful and hard to put down, even when you have a good idea about what is going to happen and the ending of the psychopath is fairly satisfying, but it was so disgusting, unbelievable, and full of hatred towards women and men that I will never pick up another one of her books.For example, one of the key characters, a young woman hardened by years of sexual and physical abuse by her father, hates both him and her mother mercilessly. She hates her mother for being hardened by living with her abusive husband and there is never once any compassion for or awareness of this mother's pain.It is hard to believe that such a lovely young woman as this author appears in her jacket photo can be filled with such sickening images."
3,What a thriller,"Lisa Gardner has great abilities as a writer. I can tell this was one of her first books. Read should not have been JT s whipping post. That was my only complaint, otherwise, it is page turner"
3,ok book,I am a fan of Lisa Gardner have read most of her books. Do not think this was one of her better ones
2,Poorly written,"I have really enjoyed Lisa Gardner's later books. Unfortunately this one is nothing like those. The characters are hard to like, and it reeks of a harlequin novel with a lot of sex mixed in. Very disappointing."
2,It's Just Cops and Sex Really !!!,"Oh gosh, the story is even WORSE than the worst episode of SVU or Criminal Minds really. Nothing great at all, there's not even a real story because everything Tess goes through in the book has ABSOLUTELY NO bearing on the ending.Mostly what I found laughable is how there was so much sex in the book - it was used for everything. JT uses sex to toughen up the weak and whiny Tess, they use sex for training, enjoyment, sorrow, anger, you name it! JT even uses sex to make her aim better and shoot the gun more on point! How dumb! Each and every time they have sex, it feels like this book is written by a teenager who thinks that SEX solves everything! If you're horny, read this book, but if you really are a voracious reader, keep well away from this book that doesn't even have a real story!"
5,Ms. Gardner is brilliant! I can't wait to read her next one,"I could not put this book down until I finished it! The author pulls you in and you actually touch the characters emotionally. Love, hate, sadness, compassion, fear, excitement. It's all there. This is truly a great book."
5,I couldn't put it down,"I loved this book! I read it in 2 days. In response to JillRief@aol.com, if this was made into a movie, Alec Baldwin would be perfect as Jim, but I think Sam Elliot would be perfect as J.T. Can't wait for her next book ""The Other Daughter."""
1,Horrible!,"This was the worst book I have ever read. I was tired of the bad language and the gory details of a murderer. This was NOT a romance novel. In fact, I threw the book away after I finished it. I have no idea how it got 5 stars at all! Don't waste your time with this one!"
1,The Perfect Husband,Boring! I have read so many of her books that I couldn't put down....this was not one of them. It could have been condensed!
1,I truly did NOT like this book----,"it just was not true to life---no one man could do all that Beckett did, he is not a superman. And didn't Tess fall in love with JT just a little too fast?? The dialogue between Jt and his sister Marion was just getting old,why not deal with it or get over it. I just could not stand another back and forth between those two,the sex stuff with JT and Tess was just so wrong, she was supposed to be so sad about her 4 yr old daughter but she keeps having all kinds of sex with JT, whywhy why?? Can we say horny??? And then when she is finally reunited with her daughter, is there any mention of her when Tess meets up with JT at the bar, where is her daughter then?? With the whore Rosalita??? This whole story is just so not real...I cannot give it a good rating at all and I won't be reading any more of Garders books."
4,Kept Me Reading!,"Imagine being married to a serial killer, a savage serial killer, and bearing his child. Then you put him in prison, and then he escapes. How far can you run to get away from him? And how many lives will he take in his wake? But Tess doesn't run. She stands up and fights, for herself and for her child. One could only admire Tess. I wonder if I would have her guts if I were in that situation, but then there are those mother instincts that keep us going. It was a great book, and I look forward to more great books from this young author."
2,"Not even close to ""The Other Daughter""","I, too, read ""The Other Daughter"" first, and couldn't wait to get this one. I was very, very disappointed. If I had read this one first, I wouldn't look for anything by this author again. Among many other flaws (in my opinion), the heroine was woosey, even though she's purported to be strong and tough, and the kid is obnoxious and unbelievable. Since this was Lisa's first book, let's hope that the trend is upward in quality."
4,Another thrilling ride from Lisa Gardner.,"Tessa has put her daughter into protective custody and is on the run from her ex-husband (an decorated ex-cop who she helped put away after discovering he had murdered 10 women) who has recently escaped from prison. Tess hides out in Arizona and hires an ex-marine to help her learn to fight and defend herself. The tension is non-stop, knowing that Tess' ex-husband, Jim Beckett, could be anywhere and has the resources and cunning to track down her and her daughter. Ms. Gardiner takes you on a non-stop roller coaster ride from beginning to end."
3,"Just OK, I'm not impressed","After reading the synopsis, I was really looking forward to reading this book. I'd never read anything by Lisa Gardner before, so I didn't know what to expect. Sadly, I was a bit disappointed by this novel. Although the writing was good and I could tell that Gardner is a talented writer, I didn't find the characters to be believable or even very likable. I also felt that the story was all over the place and didn't follow a logical sequence. Perhaps because the characters didn't seem believable to me I didn't find their story logical or believable. It was also hard to keep reading a story where I didn't really care about what happened to the characters because I didn't even really like them."
4,A Tie for the best,A tie: this novel or Justine Dare's Dangerous Ground would be my pick of Romantic Times best Mainstream novel. I liked this story and the suspense throughout the book. It was well written.
1,Completely unbelievable,"I usually look for books with a preponderance of 4 or more stars. I can't believe that anyone could give this book anything above a 3 star review. Unfortunately, I'm beginning to think that people who don't like a book, don't bother to voice their opinion. I know that I am in that category, but then again I don't like to write any reviews.I just wish there was a way to give a star rating without having to write a review.P.S. Glad I only downloaded this to my Kindle from my public library and didn't waste money on a purchase."
2,You have a Freud in me Herman,"I got this book, because I had enjoyed Gardner's ""D. D. Warren"" series. But here, far, far, far too much time taken discussing the psychological damage done to this brother and sister by an abusive father. Long, long, long before the author is satisfied, you find yourself screaming at the book - ""I GET IT!!! Now can we move on???"" I skipped over several such L-O-N-G sections of 5-10 pages, and in the end, gave up before finishing. I had intended to get the whole series, but now, I think I'll pass."
5,WOW....WOW....Scary,"My aunt has talked about this book for awhile and she finally just gifted it to me from Amazon for the Kindle. Wow I have to say that it kept me on the edge of my chair wondering what was going to happen. Her bad guy was BAD, he scared me to the point that I was checking the locks, the windows and the closets before going to bed. He was freaky scary and I hope never to meet someone like him in real life.I liked that the female, Tess, took control of her life and didn't just let things happen to her. She was determined to fight him with everything she had and even leaned new skills to add to the battle. J.T. was a strong lead, even with the condition he was in when she met him. He was determined to end this with Tess's husband and even with his loss he made a formidable foe.If you like suspense thrillers you will enjoy this book. I now look forward to finding the time to read her other books.4 1/2 stars maybe not for everyone."
4,Started out slow but picked up...,"I almost wasn't going to finish this book... a quarter of the way through and I just was not into it at all. I pushed myself to keep reading, hoping it would get better and it did get pretty intense after the halfway mark. If you can stand the boring beginning, the end part is worth it. :)"
3,3 1/2 stars,"This book started out a little slow for me and I would have liked to seen more of Jim & Theresa's marriage early on. The middle dragged a little, but I did find the ending to be a page turner. I would give this author another try."
3,Flashes of Brilliance.,"Felt led on, then disappointed. Flaws: 1) No exegesis on why the guy is so homicidal; 2) Children of abuse issues that are simply abandoned; 3) Even romantic sex is kind of a brutal thing; 4) No maniac in his right mind would walk into such an obvious trap.Flashes of brilliance check this out: ""until the little kid who'd been beaten by his father loved her, and the adolescent who'd been rejected by his younger sister loved her, and the man who'd gone off to fight wars because he no longer cared if he lived or died loved her. Until every single deranged, hopeful, frightened part of him loved her.""(sigh)It's an ok straight up chase, but *The Other Daughter* is far superior."
2,"Redundant, redundant, redundant","After I read for the umteenth time the phrase, ""sweat beaded his (her) upper lip"" or ""she fisted her hands"" I was ready to scream. The storyline is just as redundant. It just keeps tripping over itself without really going anywhere. The characters were difficult to believe, as well. The only reason I gave it two stars was because some scenes kept me reading and I was able to finish. However, I doubt I'll try another Lisa Gardner book."
5,On the edge suspense!,"Nerve shattering - this novel keeps you on the edge and flipping the pages. Tess realizes to protect her child and herself, she's got to do something. Jim Beckett is a very dangereous man. Tess turns to an ex-marine for help. Tess is forever haunted in her dreams by Jim whom seems to be haunting the police as well. Jim is very very manipulating. He somehow manages to escape from prison and Tess is his target! All I can say is ""RUN"" Tess. He's coming."
5,totally mesmerizing!,"This is the first of Ms. Gardner's books that I have read since receiving my Kindle at Christmas. It was so great that I have since downloaded ten more! If Jim Beckett didn't scare you in ""Perfect Husband"" he will in a later offering.Ms. Gardner will be at a book signing in Clt, NC in March and I plan on being there to thank this young woman for her contributions to the thrillers!"
5,The Perfect Novelist,"Lisa Gardner was a great find. I've read all of Tess Gerritsens books and needed a fix. This book has all my likes: suspense, drama, and nail biting fear."
3,Enjoyable read,"This was the first Lisa Gardner book I ever read. It's no Stephen King, but it's still a solid book with exciting twists and turns as you wonder what the psychotic husband is going to do next while he maintains his sweet and innocent appearance before he finally snaps and goes after her not caring who gets in the way. I rate this book 3.5/5 stars for a thrilling and entertaining if light read."
1,what a disaster,"The book starts out well, at least the first few pages.But then it hits a low real quick. The characters are unbelievable,there is no story it's a book of statements.This is the first and last book from this author.I'ts boring and predictable."
1,What a struggle,"This is in my Top 5 Worst Books Ever. And that is no easy feat.I could barely make myself finish it with the repetitive dialogue, awful, unbelievable, badly written characters and the plot that just went nowhere. The only person of even the slightest hint of interest was the villain and even he was poorly written. I also can't believe there is supposedly a series based on the ridiculous character Quincy. I truly hope her other works are far superior because if they are not then the publishers should be ashamed of themselves. Steer clear of this one!"
1,unbelieveable,"i have tried & tried many books by this author, & cannot for the life of me find what everyone is so taken with by her... has noone read any decent novels to compare with lisa gardner?? if i read *in the good/bad news department* one more time, i think i might even become the subject of a horror novel myself. lisa repeats herself so many times throughout the book, it becomes maddening. i have tried & tried to like this author, but just cannot find a book that even compares to decent , talented authors who know how to write. her characters are a joke, & the stories are just so amaturish, it is impossible to read them with a straight face. i couldnt even finish this book, again, with certian annoying phrases continuosly being repeated throughout the entire book. i cannot fathom how this author has gotten the reviews she has. her fans should check out some different, TALENTED authors, & see what they have been missing. i will never read another book by lisa gardner ever again."
3,I guess it's pretty good--if you can understand it.,"You have probably heard the adage ""Be careful what you ask for. You might get it.""That is true in my case. After reading Elementaria (0901938041), I lamented that the book was not philosophical enough. Now I read a book which is philosophical enough, but I can't understand it.The articles contained in this book discuss the importance of elementary music education, the influence of the Orff approach on other fields, the instrumentation in the Orff classroom, and the Orff curriculum as it relates to Orff's style of composition."
2,"At most, an audio history.....","I was very dissappointed with this cd. It is nothing more than some would-be biographer telling you how the band got together, what they accomplished in their begging year and nothing a fan with internet access can't find. It comes with a little picture book, but there aren't any pictures you can't find on-line. Pass on this title!"
1,not as good as it looks,"i bought this portable dvd player with the hope that it would last for me but it didn't. just one day like that, it decided not to work. i called the customer service/manufacturer but they didn't help in fixing the issue. i did not drop it or anything like that- i was very carefull with it. i used it for only 2 months."
3,just a player - no display screen,Was going on a trip and paid for expedited shipping - my bad - it got here on time but it is only a player and yes it has a car cord - BUT WHY - it does not have a display screen.Hooked it up to my basement TV (thru the vcr) and it works OK - just do not be misled by the ad as all the functions it can perform are dependent on hooking up a video display screen to it.Was looking for a quick inexpensive deal but if I want to use this in my van I'll need to now buy a seperate LCD Monitor!
4,A must-have for large decks,"Years ago, my wife and I were expanding our deck and used these to hold down the decking. When I finally (after five years) got around to building the stairs off the deck and into the yard, I needed another box of screws. Amazon came through, even after the shop I purchased the original equipment stopped carrying them.The screw driving... thingy (my wife calls it a ""screw rifle"") works great with these things. I occasionally have jams where the plastic bandolier gets caught in the mechanism, requiring 10 minutes of tugging, swearing and pulling to get the mechanism open enough to pull it all out again. We finally worked out the best way to insert the clip of screws so we don't get jams. This information is not in the manual, BTW.Don't forget that inside every box of screws are two driver bits taped to the underside of the lid! What a great idea. I now know to replace my driver bit every time I open a new box, regardless of whether or not I think it needs to be replaced."
5,a favorite book!,My 20 month old absolutely loves this book! We read it at least 5x per day. He loves to chime in at the repetitive parts and I love that it involves numbers as well.
4,"cut & dry tabulation of grammar; good reference, study aid","book tabulates, records, summarizes the grammatical rules of Hungarian. Pluses: can almost find a reason for any grammatical question, referring to why something is said a certain way in Hungarian, without having to refer to ""...well because it's 'hagyományos' (evolved that way)"". Also, grammatical concepts are well categorized. Minuses: some tables take time to interpret."
2,Best for Advanced Students,This is clearly advanced material and not for the faint of heart. It's also pretty dry - reminds me of old English grammar books that were quite rote and abstract. Not particularly helpful for beginning Hungarian students.
4,Great book on hungarian grammar,"This is an eccelent book on Hungarian grammar. I highly reccomend this for all of you learning Hungarian, it is a must have. The only bad part of this is that some things are not very well explaned. This is most prelevelent on the noun cases sections, where it just gives a very rough translation of what the cases mean, which could lead to people using them wrongly. The verbs on the other hand are very well done."
3,good,This book is good if you have studied hunagarian fo months. There are not to many examles and if you know and love grammer and thinks it is easy than you will understand it. But if you do not understand grammer you will be sitting with a dictionary the whole time and looking up what an indefinate verb and things like tha are. Over all it is good you just have to spend alot of time wih it to understand it
3,Love music,Brings back memories and it is so nice to have it at the touch of your hand! Thanks so much!
5,West Coast classic!,"This is a huge huge album and the best Wc album ever! This album will make ya ... bounce, no doubt!This is a must have album!"
4,Satisfying Musical Experience,"This CD is far from any African influence as previously mentioned in one review, and certainly is unlike Enigma. We have Enigma to be like Enigma. ""Boheme"" is devoted to the sounds and samples of Eastern European music as interpreted by Deep Forest, often with a driving bass techno beat. Deep Forest (Eric Mouquet and Michel Sanchez) have enlisted the wonderful Marta Sebestyen to collaborate on this CD and the results are haunting yet definitely distinct vocals as only Marta can do them. I'd say Boheme is a good initiation into the ever-changing world of the Deep Forest."
2,ICK,"Well I'm certainly in the tiny minority here. I LOVED World Mix and was all excited about Boheme, but I can't stand it. I think it's godawful. I tried twice to listen to it and I just can't. The vocals are shrill, annoying and way too much. I prefer the subtle sampling of World Mix, not the full-on crooning of apparently entire folk songs on Boheme. Boheme seems a little cheesy to me (too close to eastern european folk music), and lacks the mysterious funk of World Mix. What a disappointment."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this thinking it would be along the line s of Delerium and Enigma. It's okay on the whole, but the ethnic singing is far too over the top. One track sounds like Nat King Cole gone wrong and others sound like any old pigmy off the street has been hired to sing to a good backing track. As a result it sounds like Paul Simon's African work, after 20 pints.Track 2 is the best, but it's a shame the ethnic vocal parts are timed to badly.Get Karma by Delerium - it's 5 times better, but note it's not as heavily Africa/Ethnic based."
3,Deep Forest I is much better!,"After listening to Deep Forest I, really liking it a lot I decided to get Boheme, and honestly I was kind of disappointed. I like the first 4 tracks, especially track no. 2>""Bohemian Ballet"" but after track 4 the CD seems to go into a direction that I didn't like (kind of loses the feel that is Deep Forest and in some tracks goes with a more folkish, lot slower beat) that much."
4,Really pretty. And...did I already say really pretty?,"Boy, this is a tough one to review. For just about anyone, I mean, because this is so unusual, so far removed from anything else, even other New Age music (oh, just deal already!), there's absolutely nothing to compare it to.Which means you have to judge it for what it is, which is...well, I don't know. It has the pygmy sounds, and I could tell they were going for the ""electronica"" elements (nice touch), y'know, so it doesn't get lumped with generic New Age. Other than that, this is just a very nice, offbeat, listenable album. I did say ""really pretty"" too, right? :-)"
3,Not sure if this set is better than the Anchor Bay edition,"Due to the comments that many others have posted, I was curious about the re-released version. I discovered that the original music was replaced just like the Anchor Bay edition especially in the pilot episode. The pilot episode on here also is replaced with the season 1 theme. The opening theme was different when it originally aired. Something true TV show fans will take notice of.However, I will give this set credit for having better picture quality. The Anchor Bay set had clarity issues and seemed to have edited scenes.I'm curious as to how the second season set re-release will be. On the Anchor Bay set, the original theme of season 2 was just the season 1 credits. On TV, I remember the season 2 them was different.We'll see......."
1,NOT GETTING WHAT IS ADVISED.,THE CASE WAS BROKE ALL UP THE DVD THAT WAS TO COME IN THE SET WAS NOT COMPLETE. THIS IS NOT A PERSON I EVER WANT TO DEAL WITH.
3,hunter...,A great series to rewatch. It is interesting to watch the metamorphisus of police shows. Some of this show is dated but still a great series to have.
2,Original Scoring MISSING,I have looked for the 'Bounty Hunter Dead or Alive' episode for years and was thrilled to finally find it here. What a DISAPPOINTMENT to discover the original soundtrack with Jim Croce? is replaced with some 3rd rate jingly stuff. Big letdown and NO MENTION of it in any of these early reviews I saw. The picture quality is high.
4,"Good show, BAD music","Hunter is the epitome of the 80's shoot 'em up cop show and I love it. The episodes are clear and it's great to have the series on DVD. The only thing that bothers me is the change in the music. I was 9 when Hunter came out and I've seen every episode numerous times, and the first thing I noticed with this DVD was the change in the music. The opening theme is right, as far as I remember but other songs are missing. There's a LOT of homemade country music subsituted in for other songs like Hank William's ""Your Cheating Heart,"" and CCRs ""Bad Moon Rising."" Other than that, it's great to have this series on DVD and if the music isn't there its a small, if annoying, price to pay for an awesome show."
4,good action 80s cop show,"Hunter (1984-1991) 152 eps (7 seasons) {NBC} TV's Dirty Harry, fromStephen J Cannell & Roy Huggins. Fred Dryer (exNFL Ram) as Sgt (later Lt) Rick Hunter""Head Hunter"", and his catchphrase ""Works For Me"" (a la Dirty Harry) & Stepfanie (step-fannie) Kramer as his partner Sgt Dee Dee McCall ""The Brass Cupcake"".Her Mustang (pilot 1HYD4783),1GQO 548 {also 1MHG 709}. Radio L56.The re-occurring theme is the crappy un-roadworthy cars he gets stuck with!They tame the wild streets of LA. In early seasons his badge #089, later #378season 1 : 7 great & 7 classic of 19 eps.season 2: 12 of 23 great eps + Classic 2-part ep # 20-21"
2,Obvious Music Substitution Kills This Otherwise Great DVD!!,"I really like the show. Like the actors and everything, but eventhough it's been years since I've seen the pilot episode, it was blatantly obvious that the opening scene of the episode originally had the song ""Bad Moon Rising"" playing. When I popped the DVD into my player, this is the first red flag I noticed. I don't remember the music on the other episodes as well, but I can only imagine it has been badly substituted as well. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in this. Not even a mention/warning of this on the box. I WILL NOT BE BUYING THE REST OF THE SERIES, THAT'S FOR SURE!!!"
5,On the money.,"The Headhunter and Brass Cupcake nicknamed pair of crime fighters carry a mantra of violence as far as their supervisors are concerned, therefore the duo are denied resources that other police officers are granted normally. Dee Dee's personal car is used more often than the police units they are issued, because her's will actually run. Rick Hunter and Dee Dee McCall balance work around their boss's animosity, cars that drive themselves to the wrecking yard, really bad guys, good stories, strong action scenes and better than average punch lines to portray a pair of concerned efficient police officers in a rough environment. In other words a series that is full of action, good humor and well worth watching."
4,I LOVE HUNTER!!!,"I was so excited to see Hunter on DVD. FINALLY! There are 19 episodes from the first season including the pilot episode with Brian Dennehy. The quality of the picture is great. I have only one complaint. The shows aren't seamless, by that I mean you can tell where the commercials would be because the episodes have a very brief pause then start again. That is the only reason why I rated it four stars. Otherwise, I am looking forward to season two!"
4,Find a way...,For all those that have not seen these videos find a way to get them. I was able to rent the first 5 videos in the series from my local Hollywood video but they didn't have the rest of them.Now on to the videos. This is a good series of anime with a good plot line about a pilot who is transported into the future when he detonates a time/space bomb. He is sought out by pretty much everyone because they believe him to be a source of extreme power. I will admit that animation is not of the best quality but the story line makes up for this. The quality of animation is why I give this only 4 stars.
1,no valuable information,There is no valuable information in this review about the two novels. This should not be sold as it is a waste of money.
3,Party musid,I purchased for a French Theme party for my daughter. Celine is an awesome singer but the CD wasn't really what I was looking for at my party. I believe my daughter will love it since she speaks french fluently.
3,a selection of pop songs in french with Qubecois flavor.,This CD has many good songs by Celine..all of which are in French. No words for the songs are included which is unfortunate for those of us that like to follow along. There are several selections on the CD that I did not care for. Many however are very nice hence I average this out to an average CD...In short...if you enjoy the french pop with its sometimes mellow and mushy sometimes rock and hard style sometimes electric guitar then you will enjoy this CD. If you are the older classical type keep looking.
5,Dion for those who don't like Dion,"Flagellation is preferable to listening to the great pop ""divas"" - but there are exceptions, and this CD is one.Celine Dion sounds better in French than she does in English - and this, I have read, is the all-time best-selling CD in France. Dion's ""Pour Que Tu M'Aimes Encore"" is one of the best performances I have ever heard. Celine does every verse differently as the song builds from subdued to an emotional high. The second great vocal performance on this CD is the last half-minute of ""Les Derniers Seront les Premiers"" where she does some background warbling that just blows you away.Most of the other songs are merely very good, rather than great, and three or four of the up-tempo songs are not so good. They sound frantic. French has never been a good language for rock and roll.Dion followed this with a second, similar CD, ""S'il Suffisait D'Aimer"" which is almost as good."
5,The significance of this album is more than music itself...,"This album is wonderful,and it lighted my desire 2 learn French,now I'm in France and can speak good French.C?The significance of this album has already surpassed music itself, and it even encourages U 2 learn the language and culture!!That is the amazing power of music and this album!!'Pour que tu m'aime encore'and 'Je sais pas' were put in2 her following English album'Falling in2 U' in their English version, named as 'If that's what it takes' and 'I don't know'.So I think,the charm of these 2 songs has already conquered U. Other wonderful songs are 'Cherche encore', 'Destin', 'J'irai ou tu iras', etc. The French lyrics are more poetic and softer, so they possess the privilege 2 give songs a natural magnificence.The photos inside the case are special, 'cause in these photos Celine looks soooooo elegant, plus the photos are black&white;, which gives a taste."
5,MAGNIFIQUE!,"BEAUTIFUL BEYOND WORDS! CELINE ALWAYS DELIVERS--ESPECIALLY IN HER NATIVE LANGUAGE. MY FAVORITES ARE: POUR QUE TU M'AIMES ENCORE, REGARDE-MOI, & JE SAIS PAS. THESE HAVE BECOME ""CLASSICS"" TO ME AND ALONE ARE WORTH THE PRICE (ALTHOUGH THE OTHER SONGS ARE BEAUTIFUL AS WELL)."
5,Celine rules in ANY Language!!!,"This CD is EXCELLENT! Celine sounds better in French than in English. She sounds more relaxed here. My favorite is ""Por Que Tu M'aimes Encore"""
5,Bravo!!!Bravo!!!,Celine has brought out the romantic side of French in her most divine album yet. Many of her songs in this album are sung with pure emotion. Buy to believe!
4,A true Paisan',"I feel like I grew up with Joey Pants. His family is my family! I picked up this book because he played in one of my all time favorite movies, ""Goonies,"" and I new his face, but not his name. He's just one of those kind of actors. I don't mind saying that I hate him in the Sopranos, 'cause who doesn't? But after reading this book, even I am proud of what he made of himself. And it has restored my faith in my own abilities. I now must write a book about my verbally abusive Italian-American man-hating mother. Although his family had problems, you still get the sense that in the end they all sit around toasting to love and family like the last scene in Moonstruck! It's a quick read and you'll love it!"
4,family life,"The best part about this book is the author's unique voice. It's creative and to the point. The way he describes things carries the book.The story itself is an interesting one, but it's more about his dysfunctional parents and their marriage than about the author. His mother is quite a trip. He had a rough time growing up but goofy as some of them were, his extended Italian family was a strong source of support and I think that's why he didn't drown in his parents' craziness.This story is not about the mafia, although some people in it apparently have some bad connections. It's about a boy growing up in a close-knit, somewhat goofy family in 1960s New Jersey. And there's a lot of great insight into the family members and their peculiarities that makes it well worth the read."
2,We are Joey ... sorry we bought the hype,"I was lured by the bait of his Ralphie persona, the Imus interview and a good excerpt on Amazon, but the life of an insecure little fat kid is not charming. Mommy was a gangster's daughter who browbeat her poor husband and was ready to cheat anyone including her young son. Some of the ""Cousin"" Florie stories were ok, like hijacking the Seagram's truck from the Hoboken ferry, but a book? Fuggedaboutit!"
3,ok,It kinda started to fall of a bit but it was ok. good skateing tape but stick doesn't stay very well
2,Sandpaper?,"After I bought this product, I realized that it is almost like the sandpaper in my drawer, except it has adhesive on the back. Very abrasive hand feel after i wrapped it on my hammer."
4,Solid griptape,Grips well and sticks to the deck well. Still felt the grip after skating several days.Wasn't too different than other tapes.
4,Fine tape,"Adequate griptape for the job. Applied easily, and has about a medium amount of grab/slip for tricks. Packing could have been a bit better as the sheet had a crease in it which we had to work around. As far as the tape itself, its good."
1,It's been 2 months..,"I will right a review when I receive my friggin' paid for purchase.... So far nothing. Contacted them once they said they re-shipped it. I'm not sure where they shipped it to? Total crap. If they have a problem delivering it they should contact me. So far no email traffic unless I initiated it. So ""NO STARS"""
4,Great Grip & My Personal Favorite,"Before Mob griptape started taking over the market, Black Magic was the gold standard for skaters throughout most of the 1990s. It's a bit grippier than Jessup and generic skateshop griptape but doesn't eat your shoes super fast. I like the fact that the grip lasts better than Jessup et. al throughout the life of the deck. There are no gimmicks or perforations or graphics on this tape, just plain grippy black grip. It's too bad more shops don't carry Black Magic these days, but I'll still go out of my way to get it when I can.Good thing Amazon is offering it here, but they need to figure out how to package it better. Mine came in a huge box, which is completely necessary and a real waste. They should just carefully roll it up with the adhesive backing side facing out and hold it together with a couple rubber bands, then stick it in a smaller box."
3,not much grip,Black magic isnt the greatest. It gets bubbles easy unless your careful. you slip of the board if its damp at all. Mob grip is much better.
1,Waste of Time,This manual does not cover auto AC service or repair. Like all auto repair books what you really need is never included.
3,Not as useful as I thought,"I bought this book for my brother's Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. While it has a lot of detailed information about the car, it seems to be lacking in some (what I consider) basic information. It has wiring diagrams for the ECU but nothing for the rear brake lights (not even bulb sizes). Overall it has been useful for a couple of repairs that his car needed."
3,,"No repair information for the 1993-95 olds cutlass supreme convertible and or parts info ie..roof motor, actuator, hinges etc."
2,"Too thin, Looks Cheap, Made in China","The first thing I noticed was how cheap and sleazy the material appeared. The color was okay but the material, even though it was two layers thick, was so thin that it had almost no detectable thickness when you pinched it between your fingers. It also stretched 2x in one direction and none in the other direction (observation). I am returning the blanket for refund - I would feel guilty giving this to a charity."
5,Great Buy and Great Product,"My wife and I like this product! It is light weight, soft, comfortable, and the type of thing that when you open the windows at night here in the mountain air, it is warm early in the evening and then cools down. This blanket is something that you can use with a sheet, is very light and when it cools down you can pull it up to cover up and snuggle in nicely."
5,Every Pregnant Parent's must have handbook,"Dr. Wirth got my attention immediately with his passionate story about his friend's son. I disagree with the library journal's comment regarding it's clinical nature. On the contrary, Dr. Wirth's book is easily read and understood by the lay reader, the pregnant mom, her partner, parents and friends. Virtually anyone who wants to help positively influence the architecture of the unborn child's brain and participate in a good pregnancy outcome should pick up this beautifully written book and read about Dr. Wirth's tried and true techniques."
1,Religious hogwash masquerading as science,"How much fallacious reasoning and misguiding statements can fit between two covers? We were hoping for advice based on science rather than superstition, and were sorely disappointed. I don't mind one's philosophical perspective impacting planning or interpretation of research, but on this day I lost a lot of respect for ""Dr."" Wirth, and the medical school that found it appropriate to award his degree."
1,"Conflicting advice, misleading title","The first 90 pages or so of this book are very interesting. They claim the mother's stress level and mood form the baby's brain architecture. They cite 'personal experiences' of stressed out moms who have messed up suicidal kids. The conflicting advice is, being told stress leads to damaged children makes you feel quite, um, stressed.At first this guilt-inducing theory was unexplained.Then the rest of the book kicked in.From page 100 on, it's a very religious, you need God in your life born-again book.Ah, all becomes clear. Soon the author reveals himself as one who believes women should stay in the home, and calmingly incubate the baby (while serving their husband).Working women take on the stress that creates ADD kids. Ah. The perfect book for the Trent Lott/Pat Robertson set."
1,Mr. Trainer Personal Training for Lower Body (2001),"This is a very disappointed workout video tape. ""Mr.Trainer"" only explains how to do the exercises right and how to avoid the wrong positions. But this video it is not designed to do it together with the instructor, because he only makes 3 or 4 repetiones of each excercise.It is only good to learn about correct positions but we have to do it by ourselves because he doesn't focus on repetions."
2,Very Vague and Lacking in information,"not worth more than $10...if even that..however I have seen copies being sold for not less than $40 for quite a while..so was thinking it must really be something to look over. However, information found is ""average"" at best..and really can find more on the internet."
1,over-hyped and overwrought,"I was really sorry to finish this and find it so lacking in originality that I predicted the ending to my wife(on page 210. It seems full of wishful coincidence and -- despite a good word from Clive Cussler -- is far from the kind of medical thriller that someone like Tess Gerritsen or Michel Chrichton might produce. The plot is hackneyed, the lead character is weak, and with the medical stuff so inaccurate it is hard to take. There are bursts of good action -- the only redemption at all -- and the author didn't pull it out at the end, which I'd hoped for. This will be the last book I buy because Cussler suggets it."
4,Not a spare minute to breathe!,Both 'leads'- Kier and Jessie are strong. Some very witty and challenging dialogue. Story is a page-turner. Not a dull moment. The Tilok proverbs are great at the beginning of each chapter. The author made these up himself. A wonderful read. 3 thumbs up!
5,"The more I read, the more I enjoyed it.","I found this book similar to the thriller genre as it existed 20 years ago. It is therefore strange that I couldn't put it down and that I liked it so much. Maybe we should go back to the good old days of somewhat simple and semi-predictable plots. I continually ask myself why I wanted to keep turning the pages. The more I read, the more I enjoyed it. I liked the romantic twist which is a little unusual for thrillers. I would call this a romantic thriller. I liked Kier and found myself wanting to know more about him and his tribe. I could of used a lot more about Tilok culture. Although there are a lot of proverbs, there isn't a whole a lot about the Tiloks themselves, their culture or their religion. I would have been interested to see what the author imagined (or if he imagined anything). Overall, I thought it was a great read and can't wait to see what Dun does next."
1,Ripoff,"I like Zit's, but it's scandalous that this and other Andrews McMeel books don't specify overlapping content. Thrashed and Pimp My Lunch contain nothing other than the contents of Crack of Noon.I wasn't happy to learn that I spent (not counting S&H;) over $17 for what I could have had for $11. Also, in Crack of Noon, the Sunday strips are colored."
1,Stay away from Feit,"My cfl's lasted just over 2 years, with very little use. Not just 1 odd bulb, but 4. Additionally, the company will not stand behind their 7 year ""guarantee"" despite the fact that it is printed directly on the packaging."
4,Incredible follow up,"This album, following the breakup of Three Penny Opera, was definitely the way to go out with a bang. Combining elements from the first album and more experience this album delivers a fresh Shotmaker-ish sound with hard guitar and inquisitive lyrics. If you like this album look for TPO's first effort ""Countless Trips..."""
4,My wife's nightmare is my dream,"So, my wife hates Dylan, I think he was a rare genius, and she's so so on Bryan Ferry, and when I was young,. you knew what would happen if you were lucky enough to take someone home and she put on Avalon. Anyway, I think he does a tremendous job, Ferry has aged like a fine wine, and his voice still drips soul. but the years have done well by him. Good album if you like them both, which I do."
5,It's deserves to live..............,"Ferry's recording of Dylan songs seems to be somewhat misunderstood. Allow me to clarify.#1: There is a little joke here; the songs are Euro-noire' versions of Dylan classics.#2: The studio band sounds more like Dire Straits than Roxy Music.#3: David Bowie has covered Brian Wilson, Richard Thompson-Hank Willams while Emmy Lou Harris has a definite U2 sound on ""Wrecking Ball"" and ""Red Dirt Girl"", etc.#4: Ferry and Roxy Music have always been about romantic seduction. The suggestion I make here is that certain ""purists"" stop pouring over old copies of the ""No Depression"" magazine, get over it and relate to a real human being.All that being said; tracks #1 & #4 are clearly superior. I gave this 4 star recording 5 stars to make a point.K-Burr"
4,Great take on great songs,"Those who buy tribute albums and complain they don't sound lke the originals are beyond dumb. The whole point is to hear something familiar done a little differently. The key is always the material. Truth be told, it's hard to screw up good material, and this is about the best material you can get. Well played, well produced, and if Bryan isn't silky smooth, well neither is Bob."
2,"A Dylan Purist I am, Ferry Should Have Recorded This 10 Years Ago...","...while he could still sing. Upon hearing the first track, I thought it was a joke, but as the seconds passed, it dawned on me that this is the real thing! I changed to another track...hoping uselessly that the singing voice on the previous track was a fluke... Nope! That's hoe bryan sounds these days: like George Harrison on ""Dark Horse"", and Jane Birkin in ""Arabesque"": Old, worn out, off key, in pain, and not enjoyable at all. I really like Bryan ferry's earlier work, and even this CD could be a winner, it;s just that - oh, maybe it's me! - I just wanted him to sing like he used to. Instead he just sounds OLD and WOBBLY. I wish he had recorded this CD 10 years ago, and I would have given him 20 stars!"
1,Dull and uninspired,"Bryan Ferry needs to go back to his roots. Roxy Music continues to endure, remaining on my ""shuffle"" list. But Ferry Dylanesque is a bore. An album of covers would be risky under the best of releases, but Ferry just doesn't seem to care.""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" is the only song on this album that satisfies. The other songs sort of lope along, quivering when they should be rocking. Ferry was at his best when he was doing Ferry. His version of rock and his version of Dylan simply are failures. He is going through the motions, predictable and boring. ""All I Really Want To Do"" is put this cd in the stack of rejects."
2,Not for Dylan Fans,"I love Dylan. I received this CD as a gift from a friend who thought I would like another take on some of Dylan's work. It was hard to imagine someone being having the nerve to be ""Dylanesque"" but thought I'd give the CD a chance. There are a few pieces that are nice listening--but since when was Dylan nice listening? There are other pieces that are absolutely horrible--like nails on a blackboard. I can't turn them off fast enough. If you love Dylan don't get this CD. As for my ""Dylanesque"" I'm giving it to the person who gave it to me. He doesn't like Dylan and should just love this CD."
5,Reinterpretation is Excellent,"How could the 2 star reviewer who purports to be a Dylan fan criticize this excellent work as seeming ""to have been created for the sake of reinterpreting something that should need no interpretation"". DYLAN IS ALL ABOUT REINTERPRETATION. Another artist's interpretations are always welcome. They may or may not be your favorite versions, but some of these are masterpieces of singing in their own right. Try it out. In the online world, collections of reinterpretations of Dylan are very popular, and Bryan Ferry has made an excellent contribution. Dylan himself would never want to be stuck with just the original recordings. They were only ""sketches"", ""blueprints"" or ""outlines"" in his world, a means for new interpretations."
4,Knocking on Dylan's Door,"For anyone who admires Bob Dylan's songs, Bryan Ferry's singing, or ""Flesh and Blood""-era Roxy Music this album has much to offer. I've played it many times since purchasing it shortly after its release and enjoyed it each time. Ferry has always had a knack for taking others' songs and making them his own. Perhaps my favorite cut on ""Dylanesque"" is the up tempo, New Wave take on ""Simple Twist of Fate."" My only complaint is that Ferry didn't dig more deeply into Dylan's vast song catalogue to select some less frequently covered tunes. Something from ""Street Legal"", for example, would have been preferable to yet another version of ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door."""
1,rambling verbosity,"I have several books by this author and they are written in a compact, logical style. This book is totally different. After reading 200 pages I gave up because there was no real information in it. Functionally it appears to be a collection of his notes for a book even though the chapters are reprints of his published work. Another clue to this book being the dregs of Warfield's works is that it is the last one out of about 15 published over the last 55 years."
2,heavy duty,"This is a really heavy, heavy, heavy-going book, and not really worth the (considerable) effort needed to understand. I've heard it said that 'No-one reads Warfield anymore', and this book could be the reason. Most of the articles are irrelevant....do yourself a favor & read Van Til & Rushdoony instead.I only give this thing 2 stars because it's Warfield, who was an absolute giant of the Faith."
1,NOT WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE. VERY ARCANE. OBSCURE.,"THE TITLE IS DECEPTIVE. I'M AN INS. FRAUD INVESTIGATOR. THIS IS NOT A BOOK FOR CONSUMERS OR INVESTIGATORS. IT IS AN OBSCURE, OVERPRICED TOME ABOUT A SINGLE CASE IN NY MANY YEARS AGO. MOST OF BOOK IS EXCERPTS FROM DEPOSITIONS ETC. NO PLOT. NO INFORMATIVE INFO. JUST AN OVERPRICED DECEPTIVE TITLE WITH WORDS BETWEEN TWO COVERS."
5,Finding Freedom,"Very thorough explanations with Biblical documentation to aid in understanding ministry to hurting people. I would also recommend the DVD series by the Kylstras, which is a series of sessions that accompany the book."
5,Film lover's Must Read,This is a great book. So is the first edition. Any criticism is opinion that should not dissuade even the casual film lover from this read.
5,Nice insight into an alternate lifestyle,"This DVD is great. I have leant it to numerous friends, and despite their different interests and lifestyles all have enjoyed."
4,Great How-to video,"I purchased this video after seeing it numerous times on PBS and after reading the companion book. Although the video does not give the detail the book does, it is nevertheless inspiring.I doubt after looking at the way Dick shapes the logs and puts things together that this was his first venture into wilderness cabin construction. But, just the same, it is a very informative narrative of a creative project."
5,Loved it.,Whole family simply enjoyed it very much. Really it is just great! It is expensive but really is worth it.
5,amazing...,"how do you describe it? all i can say is that if you've found this film, then it will interest you. nobody really knows it exists, and it's probably best that way, what with some rich producer slobbering at the mouth to get ahold of something like this to create into a huge bloated completely unreal film. anyway, i first saw this on PBS, as many others did. I was able to tape it, but telethons just detract from the experience :), so went out and bought it. I showed it to my enviro science class in high school and they loved it, even inspired one kid to make his own cabin. for those who heard there is more film from Proenneke, there certainly is, thousands and thousands of feet of it, true some was lost but unbeknownst to many an entire 3rd documentary is available from Swerer's website entitled The Frozen North. This was shot entirely by Dick and features his own commentary and was his own idea of a documentary about himself. this is a fabulous film!"
5,Blown away,I just happened to see this on late night TV public television. What an amazing movie. Dangerous for a dreamer like me to watch. If they find my bear eaten corpse dead in a half finished cabin it was because of this! Ha ha. I will be ordering Alone in the Wilderness and part two and whatever else I can get my hands on related to this movie very soon! Mr. Proenneke was an amazing man and his story can teach us all a lot about life.
5,A great documentary.,This guy is hardcore. It takes a different kind of man to want to actually live his life. His building skills are amazing!
5,Don't buy this here at Amazon,You can buy this brand new from the people who publish it---Doorposts---- for $30+sh. $60 for this book is highway robbery!!!Cheryl
5,"Wonderful, Just Wonderful!","This is a wonderful book with biblical outlines for discipline and the scriptures right there to back it up. Quick reference guide in the front makes it easy to find the problem that you are needing to deal with regarding your child. It helps to remind yourself as well, of the principles God has set out for us. There is nothing 'torturing' about it (as one reviewer stated). All of the discipline is set out to be applied in Godly love to show our children the hurtful consequences of not obeying rules, consequences that all humans suffer, children and adults. It is lovingly important for our babies to understand those consequences (and rewards) at an early age instead of leaving them to find out on their own as adults in a cold and cruel world."
5,Semisonic hits another home run!!,"Semisonic has gone in a slightly different direction from their previous albums with an album more full of love-related songs, but MAN are they good. The tunes stick in your mind, from the catchy bass licks on ""Bed"" to the great singing on ""Chemistry"" and ""Sunshine and Chocolate"". This album contains a real mix of songs, some exciting, upbeat, and irresistible, others more thoughtful and introspective, but all with very interesting and poetic lyrics and great music. I wholeheartedly recommend this CD, it will keep you dancing and then sits you down and gets you deep inside with songs like ""El Matador"". Listening to ""All About Chemistry"" mirrors all the hopes, doubts, and memories which float through your mind when you think about someone you love. Very cool. P.S. -- If you are interested in more energetic, fun, rocking stuff by Semisonic, I suggest their first LP ""Great Divide"" as well."
3,"An interesting album, gets boring easily.","I've originally given this CD a 5 star review. I was also pretty crazy. This album is pretty good, it definitely has interesting points to it, and a few songs that stick to your brain.However, it's also not the most interesting piece of work in the world. Semisonic are a bit monotonic, with the potential of rising. They keep a steady line of music most of the time, therefore making the CD more or less a ""one listen"" album.You can buy it, but try listening to it first and seeing if it's your cup of tea."
5,This CD is Not a Disappointment,"I read all these other reviews and feel compelled to write in that this album is great. Semisonic has not sold out- it still has great vocals, great beats, and solid pop. That's enough. I really don't understand complaints about the album. I have the other two, and this is another solidly incredible album. Semisonic is the only pop/rock group I listen to, and they consistently deserve that position."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM,"This is probably the worst album I have ever listened to. It's happy-clappy, cheerful, bland, trite and dull. None of the songs are any good, but they still stick in your head, leaving you playing bad music in your head again and again and again. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT"
4,Chemistry,"This album is good, but very different from Semisonic's last one. It is a lot more poppy, and techno, much less a rock album than the last CD. ""Chemistry"", ""Follow"", and ""Get A Grip"" are really the only rock songs on the album. ""She's Got My Number"" and ""Sunshine and Chocolate"" are HEAVY techno songs... with way too many sound effects and crap. Be it crap, the whle album certainly isn't, it is great! Especially the softer songs ""Act Naturally"", ""I Wish"", ""One True Love"", and ""El Matador"". I think the best songs on the cd are ""I Wish"", ""One True Love"", amd ""Bed"". Though it is different than the last album, I still think any true Semisonic fan would love it...-jay --------------------"
4,This was my introduction to Semisonic,"I had no clue these were the guys who did ""Closing Time""....not that I am particularly found of that song. I hadn't heard anything else by them either. So maybe I was at an advantage coming to this album with no expectations.It came up as a recommendation on Amazon and I gave it a listen.This has quickly become a CD that I can pop in, hit play, and let it go the whole way through.Every track has something I like.So, maybe now I will explore the rest of their albums and see just what the other reviewers liked in the previous releases and didn't find here.If you're like me and have little or no previous experience with Semisonic, ignore the reviews that wax nostalgic and listen for yourself."
4,Sound Design,Semisonic's 4th cd continues their tradition of solidly crafted pop songs. These songs from chemistry to el matador are noteworthy for the care and craftsmanship of the songs. Carole King gives a wonderful sound to One True Love.The band is also great in concert.
2,"The title is right, in a way...","...that is, there is little chemistry between this album and me, and without that chemistry I can't give this CD a good review. I loved Feeling Strangely Fine and The Great Divide sounds like a promising purchase in lieu of any *new* releases, but this album sucks overall. It's missing that essential edginess that their earlier albums had, and without that element all that's left is quiet ballads.That said, I gave this album an extra star because it does have three really good songs: the title track Chemistry, Sunshine and Chocolate, and El Matador. The last of the three is a good example of how the rest of the album sounds, but it is the best of the slow and quiet tracks that this album is populated with.My recommendation is to buy the three songs I listed online if you can, or another option is to buy a used copy of the CD, rip the three songs, and sell it back for the next guy to do the same with."
2,Don't buy this set,"Don't buy this set. The box makes it look alluring - but it is incredibly cheaply made and inside the dividers etc are chipped cracked and broken. The six colors are not even theessentials. Better to get a wood box and buy a primary set of colors.I'm sorry I went for it, but the paints themselves are still fine."
2,Not woth the money,"I bought the set at a local art store with a 50% off coupon. I paid 40.00 and I feel I still paid way too much. The box is cheap, I had to glue a divider in place as soon as I got it home. The paint is fine, but a cardboard shoe box would have worked as well as the one I got."
5,Tradd at Ashley River El.,I think that the Extinct Alphabet book is a really good book. The book has good drawings and hidden meseges in the pictures. It's sad that only 1 Jamacin long-tonged bat is left on the earth and it's in a glass jar. that's sad that they killed the deer for dog food.
5,Wes at Ashley River Elm.,I liked the interesting illustrations by Ralph Masiello. The words and sentences by Jerry Pallotta were fantastic.I haven't any of his books.I want the Extinct Alphabet Book
2,Tristan at Ashley River El.,What I like about Ralph Masiello's illustrations is he hides pictures. He hides them very well. His illustrations are also very colorful. He uses very bright colors. Also he shows a lot of details in his drawings. If you would like to read one of his books I would recommend the Extinct Alphabet Book.
5,Dane'cha at Ashley River Creative Arts Elementary.,"As Mrs. Sneed read the book, I liked when there was a five-eyed bug. The illustrations were magnifcent. My favorite part was when the artist, Ralph Masiello, accidently spilled paint, and it looked like Elvis. I also liked when Jerry Palotta was hidden in the rock with a wolf on top of the rock. Mr. Ralph Masiello's illustrations are outstanding, awesome, and EXTRAORDINARY. I gave the book it five stars!"
4,Arthur at Ashley River Creative Arts Elementary,"The book I read was superb and fascinating.I enjoyed the secret pictures, too. They were fabulous. I also loved the creative illustrations. I think Ralph Masiello did a wonderful job."
2,Ashley River Creative Arts Elementry,"I liked the book because it had hidden words in the book,and it has good pictures on every page. The book has a lot of good drawings in it too. The book is very artistic and creative."
3,Tosha at Ashley River Creative Arts El.,"As I was listening to Mrs. Sneed read The Extinct Alphabet Book I liked the part where the coelacanth isn't really extinct.I would give it 3 stars. IT was fascinating,creative,and artisic.It had lots of secrets in the book I hope you read this book because you will find all the secrets in it."
4,....This is what led Smash Mouth to a multi-platinum career,"This is Smash Mouth's real stuff. It has alot of songs from Fush You Mang and 1 song from Astro Lounge, but a little different music and some changed lyrics. The new songs on here like ""solitude"" and ""to be continued (hidden track)"" are really catchy. The song ""sorry"" is kind of rude but its a good song, the way i see it. I'd say this is Smash Mouth's 3rd best album, next to FYM and Astro Lounge...."
1,bad!,"Astro Lounge was their best cd by far. They sell more cd's when they don't have cursing. Fush U Mang was a good cd, but this one is plane bad. They should cut back on the heavy metal, and do really good rock."
5,Raw Smash Mouth!,"This is an awesome collection of all the early demos and unreleased cuts from this awesome band! It is so cool to hear the raw, rough, energetic cuts of some of the songs we love that later appeared on the band's album Fush Yu Mang. It features a bunch of songs from the Fush Yu Mang sessions that are just as good if you were a fan from that time."
2,Insufficient detail to be of much use,"The typesetting of this book makes it very difficult to read. It appears to be a scan of a typed page. In any event, although it does summarize some of the basics of medical device design such as design controls, the design file, submission of an IDE/510(k)/or PMA, it does not give enough detail to be of any use. The reader can get all of the information in this book from FDA guidance documents, which are free."
4,okayyyyy!,the doll is soo cool just the lips have to goo she looks like a fish with these lips oh and whomever keeps saying for every bratz head hair cool lips not cool that is soo annoying also look at my review at the live in concert cloe its the mommy one
2,WHO LET THE DEMONS OUT?,"BLUE HAIR? COOL. AQUA LIPS? NOT COOL! I LURRV JADE, BUT NOT THIS! BUY SOME OTHER STYLIN HEAD INSTEAD. EVEN THE MY SCENE ONES ARE BETTER THAN THIS."
3,There's better collections.,"Though what is on ""Super Hits"" is all good stuff, I would suggest another choice. This does have hits like ""El Paso"" and ""Devil Woman"" like all collections should, but at just 10 tracks, too much is missing. A better disc is the 20 track ""A lifetime of song (1951-82)"". Another good one with all his western stuff is ""No. 1 Cowboy"". That gets you the good stuff from this disc, plus ""Big Iron"" and ""Cool Water"", and many more. 20 in all. ""All time greatest hits"" is good too. Also 20 tracks. After Marty, the other two names you want are Johnny and Willie. Enjoy."
5,Super Hits-Marty Robbins,"This is a must CD to buy if you are a fan of Marty Robbins, this album contain all his great hits delivered by his wonderful strong voice. It was sad that his life was short lived."
5,great book!,I loved this book! Luther's life unfurls with drama and style--much like his live shows. I've been a Luther fan for years and learned more about him--and had a greater appreciation for him--by reading this book. I definitely recommend it!
2,"OK, NOTHING MORE","I'm not a huge Luther fan, but I like his music. I read a few chapters and after a while I didn't read every word, I pretty much skimmed each chapter. I knew he had written and sang lots of jingles, but I didn't know he wrote a few songs for The Wiz. A few didn't make the cut, but one made it in toward the end of the movie. I can't remember the name of the song, but the words are can you feel a brand new day?. It's the scene at the sweatshop and the evil queen dies. He worked for Davie Bowie, Bette Midler and a few others. There is nothing juicy about this book. Luther has always been a pro and very serious about music, and we know this without reading the book. Don't buy it and waste your money like I did. Oh, the photos are nice."
5,Inspirational,"The story is inspirational; aspiring artists should read it to appreciate the obstacles and fears that perseverance overcomes. After finishing the book, I was inspired to begin my artistic projects again. Also, it was a wonderful journey down memory lane."
5,"An Inspirational, Uplifiting Read!!!!",This book cuts to the heart of Luther's artistry and spirit. A must read!!!! Great for the beach!!!
5,"If you're passionate about Luther, this is a ""not to miss"" read..","I as with many other fans lost more than a singer when Luther passed away last year. Luther's songs touched the very core of me during the days I was trapped in a loveless marriage; he seemed to know very intimately what I was experiencing and seemed to express those very words so meticulously in his verses. It wasn't until I read this book that I could even begin to know why. His own tragic and lonely search for love ironically proved to be a blessing to the world in providing the many cherished loved songs that will play on forever.If you are a true Luther fan this is a MUST read. You will begin to understand and find the parallels of his works with his personal life and his haunting weight struggles. A true professional, Luther never delivered less than perfection in his music and it was through his pain that his fans were able to look beyond love. I am looking forward to a followup to this book. : )"
5,When I say goodbye.it's never for long because I believe in the power of love,I read Luther's book a week after he passed.Once I read his book I felt closer to him and received a better understanding of his career and life.His songs revolved around some of his heartaches that he had been and were going thru.Luther you were a great man and you will be greatly missed.
1,CAN YOU SMELL THE CHEESE!!!,"GIVE ME A BREAK!!!!Another of the old 80's gang getting together and attempting to make outdated music and annoy anybody who accidently wastes their money on this c.d. I warn you all now, DO NOT buy this crap.Nikki sixx and Traci Gunns couldn't put a good song together back in the 80's, now fast forward a few years and this is the crap you get. It's simple, thoughtless music that every 15 year old who picks up an instrument for the first time can make.Geez, what's next, is Mike Tramp going to team up with Rudy Sarzo and come out with something too.Just look at the bands name and you'll get an idea of the cheese they're offering you!!!Why do four grown men call themselves brides for, anyway? and what exactly are they supposed to be destroying? Good taste in music???!!"
1,Tell it like it is,"If he repaid me (his mother) the $25K he stole from me his music and judgement in general would be much better I'm sure.No biggie, just my inheritance from my mother.He stole it over a year ago. He's my only child and never ever calls or visits, never has either.This seems to be the only way to communicate.Sorry Trace, but I have to do whatever I can to get you to give it back."
1,What happened to Motley Crue??,"Whatever happened to Motley Crue, and why did they have to go and make this sludge?? I like the 9-song '80s formula they're trying to emulate, but the music ain't on par with Crue. ""Shut the 'you-know-what' Up"" is mean-spirited and disloyal to Crue and their counterparts. I did like a few songs on this record CD, but only because it reminded me of vintage '80s metal ballads. Otherwise, Crue need to reform and tour, in order to take the world by storm, as they did in '89-'90...LONG LIVE CRUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,ALLRIGHTEE THEN!!!!!!!,"Want to throw away good money, buy this.I get embarrased listening to this because it's awful and you got these has beens (if they ever were in!) making this music and actually think it's good.No originality, not one pleasurable song and a name that's so ridiculous, you'd think a 7 year old came up with it."
5,This CD F***ING ROCKS !!!!!,"If you like it loud, this is one to procure.Too bad it was a one album band ...Yeah, I know there are other albums.Hint ... PHHHTTT !!!!!"
2,What is everyone comparing this to?,"Ok, those of you giving this 4, or 5 stars...one question. What are you comparing this to, Britney Spears or N'Sync? This album is not even average. I am a HUGE Traci and Nikki fan, but this cd does not deserve anything near 4 stars. Nikki rants and raves about how he did not want an 80's singer and wanted someone fresh, this guy, London is not fresh, he is annoying. No charisma, on the cd, maybe live (don't know, haven't seen them). In closing, this cd comes nowhere close to even the worst Motley cd, or any L.A. Guns cd."
4,I like it....,"It is inventive, heavy, punk and melodic. I can not wait to see them on tour. The lead singer is very decent, the drummer is good and Sixx/Tracy G. do what we all expect and this rock."
1,poorly developed and conceived,"While this is a paperback romance novel, and I picked it up at a Free Store (a place where everything is free) with few expectations, once I finished it I felt it had not been worth my time. The characters are very poorly developed and there is little motivation given for their actions. While I enjoyed the New Orleans backdrop, the too perfect heroine who is being stalked by an extremely handsome man got tiresome very very quickly, as did her all too understanding boyfriend who happened to be a psychologist, so he could explain all the actions of the stalker in overly simplistic terms.Don't waste your time."
3,"Not exactly wht I was looking for, but OK","This book was just OK for me. I was hoping for something that read a little less like a romance novel and more like good historical fiction (See 'The Autobiography of Henry VIII' and 'Mary, Queen of Scotland and the Isles' by Margaret George). However, it did allow me to understand the political machinations of Papal life during that time period a little better. (and I suspect it has not changed much in +/- 700 years! Oops! Did I just write that?) Actually, I should have realized what the writing style would have been like, as I had read many Victoria Holt books growing up. Based on this book, I will not be reading the sequel."
4,A Page-turner,"At the time I read this book, I didn't know there was a mini-series about the Borgias. I would only hear references to that family name whenever evil in its vilest forms was being discussed, but I didn't know specifics about why they were so evil. Well, this book makes all that very clear, in terms closer to tabloid reading than a dry history book. It so whet my appetite for the next installment that I had to buy the sequel!"
5,A really good read!!!,"This book is a thriller that combines true friendship and real courage of a young girl during the Holocoust. Though she is not jewish herself, her best friend Ellen is. To safley transport Ellen and her family to free Switzerland, the girl must risk her, and her friends, lives.I call it A thrilling adventure with a satisfactory ending. If you like stories about the Holocoust, like I do, you should definetly read this book soon!!"
1,Literature Guide,It is very misleading. It is a little nothing packet. There is nothing in there to help you guide a class through reading the book.
2,Don't like it,"Just tried once; the endless press-ups are boring and killed my shoulders or arms, don't know which. Don't want to do it again. I have two other very good yoga DVDs so don't have time for this one.They are: Spirit of Vinyasa Flow with Deb Dobbin. I like it. Just like it.Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders Body Slimming Yoga - I like this one even more as easy to do. Very good after a hike or when I want relaxation, strength or even to lose weight."
1,Definately NOT for beginners,"I wanted to start practicing yoga and needed to tone up my upper body for my wedding in November. I searched and found this DVD, read the reviews for it, and decided to purchase it. I first watched the DVD all the way through and ""thought"" that I could surely do it, it didn't look that hard. Let me tell you, it is alot more difficult to execute those transitions and poses than it seems. The transitions, the poses, and even the evenly spaced 108 postural push-ups. It's definately NOT for a beginner. I am sure that someone who has practiced yoga for a while and maybe even done some of Shiva's DVDs would do just fine. I am just really disappointed!"
3,pick one,"I enjoy Shiva Rea's DVDs, but I must be careful not to by them all. If you have one of Shiva's abs videos, you have enough. As always the scenary is awesome. But one really is enough."
1,Too hippie for me,The music in the background is too loud to hear the woman's voice most of the time. This is not an intense workout as I had hoped and is kinda wishy washy. She's very much a hippee with cheesy go with the flow sayings. You wont get a stomach like that from this video its not hardcore enough.
5,Wow!,"I love this dvd, it kicks my butt! By the end I am completely sweaty and my arms feel like jell-o, I love it!"
1,Not quite as advertised,"I was seeking pure aloe vera gel when I bought this from Amazon. The photos and item description claim ""100% aloe vera."" This is not accurate - once I got the bottle I read that it contains a bunch of unpronounceable chemicals, glycerin, and very heavy perfume that will linger long after the gentle effects of the aloe have passed. It's so bad I will have to buy something else and hope it doesn't reek! My advice: seek elsewhere for a more natural product - this *isn't* pure aloe gel!"
1,Searching,"I need to know if there is a photo of a mural of a gorilla cracking through a wall with fruits hanging all around him, in this book.Help!"
5,"Good quality, price and style","I've paid 4x as much for other ""designer"" seats. None looked as nice or held up as well as this one. Classic Design goes well with almost any decor from Traditional to Cottage."
4,A wonderful mix of Dance/Punk rock music.,"When I saw the film, I loved the music. It was loud, crazy, hip hop mixed with punk. I wanted to own it! The album is very short, only 41 min. long, but time isn't everything. The work of Lou Barlow is great. Most of the album is ""Folk Implosion"", Lou's band. There are only 3 songs out of the 13 that I dislike, for they don't sound like music. ""Casper the Friendly Ghost"", ""Raise The Bells"", and ""Good Morning Captain"". But I think any Barlow fan should by this album, a great works, from a great film."
3,"Good, but a little too edgy.","I did the review for the movie, so I figured why not the soundtrack. This is rather good, but a little bit too edgy for me. ""Natural One"" is the one I heard alot on the radio down here in Florida. I don't know how it fared in the rest of the United States, but to me it's one of the scariest songs I've ever heard. With the droning bass line, and the psychedelic guitar solo. I did find some of this to be pretty good like ""Daddy Never Understood"", ""Jenny's Theme"", and ""Good Morning Captain"". I know the movie is just as edgy, so I'm not surprised that it would spill over into the soundtrack."
2,the REAL soundtrack,"For anyone who's interested, here are the hip hop songs from the movie:Pow-Beastie BoysIn 3's-Beastie BoysSabrosa-Beastie BoysWhutcha Want-NineDa Bichez-DJ Premier & Jeru the DamajaWord is Bond-Brand NubianWrong Side Of The Tracks-ArtifactsCrooklyn (Inst.)-Crooklyn DodgersOh My God-A Tribe Called QuestListen Up-E RuleTime's Up-O.C."
3,Kids,Not a big follower of Folk Implosion. Good solid soundtrack though-enjoyable if not even the most diehard FI fan. Recommended.
3,Why this -unfortunately- CANNOT be a 5-star album...,"Two tracks are excellent (""Climb the mountain"" and ""Joy""), three are really good (""Always remember"", ""For You"", and ""Just what it takes""), the rest is just average. I have just discovered this man everybody seems to talk about in the U.S.(he is virtually unknown in Europe), and as the critics are excellent, I am perhaps overexpecting. The fact is that I regret Kenny Lattimore does not insist a bit more with tracks like ""climb the mountain"" (a track I insistently play on my show on a Spanish F.M.) and locks himself into too many ""already heard"" style mid-tempo songs. He definitely shows he can do things well, the question is how he is going to focus his career. As a comparison, for a first album, Adriana Evans, Rahsaan Patterson or Juanita Dailey have done better."
4,For You,"I really enjoy listening to 'FOR YOU'. I have to say it's my favorite song of all time. I can listen to it over and over and over again and don't get bored. Whenever I listen to it, it makes me feel so relax from head to toe. It's difficult to explain how I feel whenever I hear that song. I would love to meet you. Come to Toronto, Canada."
4,Good but not great,"A moving story and time line. This is more difficult for DM's to control but some players like it. If you are looking for more of a dungeon crawl, this is not the product for you. However, overall this is a good product."
5,Almost as good as Siren...,"and since I'm obsessed with Siren right now, that's nothing to be ashamed of. What can I say? This is one of those albums that you'll fall in love with immediately and then listen to over and over again..."
3,"Good CD, but not worth five stars","Heather Nova's CD Oyster although, a CD for some times, it's variety is a bit in the lacking. The first song, Walk this world with me is the only real upbeat song on the album, and although songs like Island, and Doubled Up have a unique and catchy quality, I found that the other songs just seemed to fade together into an unoriginal song that I have heard by many artists as the song you merely skip over on an average CD. While I do think that this is a valuable CD to add to your collection, if you want something a bit more up beat, try her newer CD Siren. The songs are happier and more fun. Oyster is a great CD for when you are angry or depressed, but personally, I need a CD with a bit more variety; a CD I can listen to when I am happy or sad."
3,If you like this kind of music...,"I don't really like this kind of music. I saw a picture of her somewhere.was struck by her beauty and really interesting look. I said to myself,""Hmmm, let me look this woman up"", went to Amazon and was astounded by thereviews and said What the hell...But the problem is, for me, she justdoesn't stand out from the pack. Besides, I am not into the 'singersongwriter stuff', so maybe I am not the one to review this. I guess mylocal CD store that I sold it to isn't impressed either, as it is sittingin their $1 bin. You win some and some you lose. Not my kinda thing. Tootame for me."
5,Most Overlooked Masterpiece,"I give 5 stars if everything on the album is good, plus their are outstanding tracks. This album has at least five rock masterpieces on it and the rest is real good. I've been playing this album frequently now for over 10 years and it sounds as great today as when it first came out.Walk This World With Me, Island, Throwing Fire At The Sun, and Sugar rank among the best rock music ever produced. A unique strong voice which shows emotional intensity as very few ever have. Some of her songs (like Island) transport you to a safe, soft, dream landscape- and then - the guitars and voice rev up with an intensity that comes raging at you out of nowhere, throws you against the wall, and slaps you in the face. Yea, it gets your attention allright. What an experience! Unfortunately none of her other albums use this technique much if at all. This is the one Heather Nova Album everyone should own. It is a largely overlooked masterpiece that will stand the test of time and fads."
5,A Fantastic Album,Oyster is an absolutely fantastic CD. Heather Nova displays her trememndous vocal range throughout this album. I highly recommend that you add Oyster to your collection - you won't be disappointed!
5,Heather Nova is Definitely an Angel !!!,"I have skimmed through the entire reviews for this album and no one really mentioned 'Maybe an Angel'. This is the song I like most off the album. When you listen to it, you will feel like me that even though her voice is a soft and smooth high-pitch one, yet it shows an incredible strength at the same time. And the music, oh boy, it is so catchy and is so compatible with her lyrics and wonderful voice. For me, this one song is worth spending money for. Her entire CD is not bad either. In fact it is excellent. Thanks to my friend, who introduced Dawson's Creek to me, through which I discovered her first from her Siren album and then this. I am plannig to get all of her CDs now. I can tell you that you will not be disappointed."
1,Did not flatten,"This wig was purchased for a child's Cleopatra costume and we never did use it. We could not get it to flatten out so it looked like the picture; it stayed kinked from the packaging, even days later."
4,good wig!!,At first I wasn't too sure the wig would turn out right until I put it on my daughter head and it fit her head good and she liked it no problem with the wig I'm Satisfied.
2,Risk Tin is weak,"I was very disappointed with the Risk Tin. Risk itself is a great game, but the tin, board, and pieces in this set are very weak. The army figures are small, cheap, plastic. The cards are smaller than normal and the board is disappointingly dull and cheap looking. The tin is thin and did not hold up well in the shipping process. It is not worth the $30 dollars I paid for it. Buy a different version, this one is weak."
2,You get what you pay for!,"I ordered this robe based solely on it's price. You certainly get what you pay for, poor quality! It is thin and sized as one size fits all but after one wash it shrunk to maybe a womans medium. Luckily I am only 5'2 and can still wear it, however my boyfriend who is 5'9 certainly could not! It also shed a great deal in the washer and the dryer! If you are looking for a cheap ""disposable"" robe then this is the one for you."
3,Too Heavy,"It would be great for a winter robe, but I read ""Lightweight"" on the description and thought it would be good for summer...it is NOT. It would be a 5-star for a winter robe."
2,Disc function,"For the most part this DVD series works, however one of the discs will not play its second side on any DVD player in the home or computer. Other than this issue, which I emailed the manufacturer about and recieved NO RESPONSE, this DVD set was a good deal. The memories it brings back to me, yes im a 40 year old kid and bought this for myself not the kids, are wonderful and I've watched what I can of this series 3 to 4 times myself just reliving my childhood again."
4,Excellent lost episodes!,"I was not a fan of Dynomutt, but for years I missed the rarely-seen Scooby episodes. I've always thought they're campier AND creepier than the original Scooby-Doo Where Are You. I was thrilled to find these 'lost' episodes on one DVD, especially ""The Ghost of the Bad Humor Man"" and ""High-Rise Hair Raiser"" and ""The Harum-Scarum Sanitarium"". Great for nostalgia, even if now-grown Scooby fans recognize how cheesey the plots can get...My only complaint is about the unprinted discs; I wish episode titles could have appeared clearly on each. But definitely worth buying."
3,little confused,they should have just released scooby doo and dinomutt seperate bacause i dont really like dinomutt. they should have just released all 40 episodes (3 seasons)of the scooby doo show in a set by itself
2,Boy what Garbage.....,"I remember when I saw this on Cartoon Network's sister station, Bommerang, just recently and boy this show really stunk, with unlaughable jokes, and terrible plots. It looks like 1970's low budget trash, which it is."
3,Scooby and the mystery inc. gang,Is scooby doo in this a lot? Or is it more of the Dynomutt dog? I have never even heard of dynomutt. I love scooby doo and the gang so much! But I won't like this if they're not in it and it's more of that other dog. Can someone tell me please. Thanks!
2,"Scooby Doo Dynomutt Hour, The Complete Series","I did not want to review this item when I first received it because I was so angry. I do understand that I paid for a used item, however, 2 of the DVD's were unplayable. The videos would just freeze. The only reason that I have not sent it back is because my son loves the other 2 videos and cries when I tell him that we are sending the set back.Irene M. Dunham"
3,Scooby Doo Dynomutt Hour,"Great idea to put these out in the original one hour show combining both Scooby & Dynomutt stories, but WHY COULDN'T WARNER HAVE INCLUDED THE ORIGINAL ""SCOOBY DOO/DYNOMUTT HOUR"" BEGIN THEME?Is it their hobby to annoy their fans?Why also, did they only release 15 of the 24 episodes of the previous series ""The New Scooby Doo Movies"", when they made the set? That's why I didn't buy it.WARNER TAKE NOTE ONCE AND FOR ALL: We don't want sample ""Best of..."" episodes. We want full serieses.How about the original 13 episode ""Sealab 2020"" being put out on DVD, instead of the modern send-up Sealab 2021?It can't be that hard, Warner.Peter"
2,Old content under new name,"Beware. Old content recycled under a new name. This ""Scooby-Doo Dynomutt"" contains the same episodes of the Amazon instant video title ""The Scooby-Doo Show Season 1"""
3,Not the complete series,"This is not the complete series. If you go to Hanna Barbera's website, there is 24 episodes listed under the Scooby-Doo Dynomutt Hour. This collection only contains 16. What happened to the other 8? If you absolutely can't wait for the full collection, then buy it, but if you're waiting for all 24, then it's better to hold off."
4,Interesting book,Learned some facts that are not taught in school. History books need to be changed to include facts. Our full heritage as a nation is important.
1,don't buy this stool,The stool is very poorly made and started to come apart within weeks. The seller did immediately refund my purchase price but - don't buy this product!
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,BROKE THE FIRST TIME WE USED. MY MOTHER HAS ALZHEIMERS AND I BOUGHT THIS SO SHE COULD SIT IN THE SHOWER AND I COULD WASH HER. SHE ONLY WEIGHED 110 LBS BUT IT BROKE AND I WAS VERY LUCKY IT DIDN'T CUT HER WHEN IT DID. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
3,The cat came with a broken tail,"When I received the animals, I was pleased with the size of the animals, even though they are not to scale. However, at closer inspection the cat's tail is coming off. I don't think I would order this again."
3,Quality not great,"I was eagerly waiting these animal set in order to teach my son his animal sounds and make it more interactive. Even though it fills the purpose I was disappointed on the quality of the animals, specially the ones with ""fur"" they seem to have some seams in the plastic on the butt area that make them look cheap. Some tails also seem ready to come off if you pull hard enough (which I can imagine my son doing in the foreseeable future).Still I went ahead and purchased the farm set as well since there's not much else to choose from in terms of size and these ones are perfect for little hands."
2,Defective DVD'a,This is the first time I've ever had a problem with a DVD. These two DVD's which show to be from Timeless Video are of very poor quality. The picture quality is fine but one disk has a mark on it which want let it play on A DVD player. Had to use computer DVD to play the disk. The 2nd disk kept hanging up. I would return them but at the price I got them for I Will find some way to use them. Whoever Timeless Video has got making these DVD's are not doing a very good job is all I can say.
5,Without flaw,"One does tire of all the 5-star reviews, but this is truly a transcendent piece of work. The Modfather incorporates all the elements that have made his career great--the guitar work of The Jam, the experimentation of The Style Council, the drifting thoughtfulness of his first solo album--with the superior songwriting he's always demonstrated into a Sgt. Pepper moment....Each of PW's solo albums is great listening, but this is career-defining stuff--one of the best albums of the '90s."
2,"Sorry, The Fire HAS Gone Out","All sane people agree that The Jam was huge on so many levels. I don't care what anyone else says, The Style Council was Weller's creative apex (most people don't appreciate truly good food either). Wildwood is perhaps the best of Weller's solo material but c'mon, it's a shell of his former brilliance. So much of it is generic and forgettable. I saw him live in LA this summer and it was fine, but the creative well of new material is dry."
2,SO let down,I was not expecting this to be so cheap in quality and for it to feel like an elderly's shirt( you know what I am talking about...the material that is thin and itchy). I am not a busty lady at all( I ordered a 2x and I wear a small C cup) and it was super tight. I thought by the picture I would feel sexy but instead I feel like Goodwill would not even want this reject. So much for feeling sexy on my honeymoon.
4,Lovely accent,"I bought this poster in an attempt to brighten up my room and even though the dimensions of the poster are indeed listed in the product description, I somehow expected it to be larger than it actually is. It's more or less the size of a sheet of standard printer paper so make sure you have a specific place on your wall for it where it won't be overwhelmed by the size of the wall. I put mine above my lamp next to my bed in a small alcove where it fits perfectly. The material the poster is printed on is substantial and thick, but the background of the poster print is not quite as white as it is advertised on the posting. It's a little darker than eggshell white, with kind of a greyish tint to it. The color of the lips are as advertised though.Overall, a cute accent for a bedroom or powder room."
1,I'll give you 30 minutes and you'll scream for the shotgun.,"When I saw Habitat in the video store, I thought, ""Y'know, that might seem like a good T&A flick."" I was wrong. What little T&A they showed was good, but other than that, this movie really sucked. The acting just made you want to say, ""Okay, whatever."" This movie was more like a bad acid trip or a corny dream than a Sci-Fi flick. In fact, I was really tempted to just push the stop button and end it, but no, I had to finish it. So please, stay away from this movie. If you see it in a video store and think it may be a good T&A flick, then just skip it and go to the porn section."
1,I want the two hours I wasted on this back,"My first impression of Habitat was that this was gonna be a really underrated and overlooked sci-fi gem, but the end results are one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The storyline is intriguing and interesting, but the screenplay and direction are overly sloppy, not to mention that Balthazar Getty and Tcheky Karyo are wasted in their roles, if they're acting talents were better used, this movie might have been not so bad. One good quality though, there is some nice T&A, and I never realized how hot Alice Krige was until I saw this, but other than that this movie is a waste."
1,Garbage,"God help me, I had to sit through 'Habitat' at a film festival a couple of years ago with another of the same directors hideous movies. Five hours of mind numbing garbage that ended at 4.00am !If you make the mistake of getting it out on video just fast forward to the Alice Krige bits (all hail the Borg Queen!) and forget the rest."
3,Redeemed only by the nudity,"Yup, Alice Krige and Laura Harris showing their gorgeous bods is the ""best"" thing about this film.There's really not a whole lot to say about a film that seems like it was probably originally an exciting-sounding concept to its creators, but ended up being somewhat....blah. I'm not sure how they could have pulled off a film in which a family's house turns into a living jungle, and the Dad turns into some sort of weird creature which can break down into little green molecules and fly around because of his science experiments. The neighbors who dislike them get killed trying to put a stop to the house's growth. Okay. BUT...Laura goes for a nice skinny-dip, which makes this essential viewing for any Celeb skin collector."
3,For the fungus lovers in all of us,"I love the premise of the movie, that the earth is changing s mankind must change too. There will always be those that are scared of change, and what they don't understand they want to destroy. The acting is quite cheesy, the scenery is nicely put together, but overall the effects are well made.The sound was awful, the music was too loud to hear what the actors were saying, the menu was complicated, unlike anything I have ever seen, there was no control for audio or for subtitles, there was only a main screen and scene selections. I gave this movie a 3 for the terrible audio, but the color and scenery were outstanding."
5,Pretty cool sci-fi flick with some wild special effects. Blu-Ray please?,"Habitat was a really bizarre movie indeed but there were some moments that are worth a look for some people: the film's CGI effects were interesting, you also got two attractive women showing off their bodies, Alice Krige and Laura Harris (check out the pond scene in the movie, pretty exotic). The insides of the house when it becomes infested with plants was by the far the special effects of the movie itself, and it was really cool and bizarre. Overall, this movie is fantastic and is worth a look indeed. The only gripe I have is the DVD release. The film's special effects would look fantastic on Blu-Ray. IMDb claims that the movie was shot in HD quality and it partly shows on DVD. Blu-Ray would do this movie justice."
4,Muy interesante y de facil lectura,El que no entiende mucho de inversiones deberia leerlo como fue mi caso. Con ejemplos muy sencillos la autora expone las definiciones de muchas palabras confusas para las personas ajenas a Wall Street. El unico comentario negativo es que es dirigido a mujeres aunque su mensaje no tiene sexo.
3,It Alright....,"I dont' want to diss B2K but this CD isn't all that great. The B2K songs on this CD are good but I don't like ""Gots Ta Be (Allegro Love Remix)"" and I don't really listen to ""Back Up.""I really don't like Jhene on this CD. I really don't like her at all. Furthermore, I really dislike the way B2K keeps on supporting her just because she is Lil' Fizz's cousin. She got signed only a month after they got signed and they're promoting her more than they ever promoted themselves.Also,she can't sing; she just had this kind of cutesy voice that makes it sound like she can kind of sing. And if they are going to try to make her a star, then why do they give her reject songs?I dislike Jhene but B2K sounds good on this CD. I wish B2K didn't break-up. I wish they could go back to the studio and make a third album because I would be the first one on the list to buy it.If you like B2K, then you'll like B5. Check B5 out! B2K and B5 are hot!!!!!!!!!!Leah Star Age:16"
5,B2k iz off da chains!!!!,awwww....im so happie jhene puttin herself out dere!!! she gon be a future starr 4sho!!! datz ma homegurl forrealz...B2k is sooooooo HOTT ST3 wuz all good!!!!Reppin t-dot 4 sho!!
4,NOT HER USUAL,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED, AS THE MUSIC Í FELL WASN'T HER USUAL STANDARD. HER VOICE STILL GREAT."
3,Folksy pop for many,"Elvis Perkins seems to have tried to create an album that everyone would enjoy. It is nice to listen to, has some of the folksy sound and lyrical tricks that Dylan brought in, and has some obvious sixties-inspired pop-songs (May Day). This probably works pretty well for those who enjoy the smooth melodies of contemporaries like Iron & Wine, Bright Eyes, Micah P. Hinson Willy Mason. The studio production clearly does not place Elvis in the lo-fi tradition of others. I am somehow surprised that people who listen to Vic Chesnutt also enjoy Elvis Perkins (as I can see on his profile page on Last.fm). I am tempted to go for two stars here, but decided to give a third for some of the bleaker, melancholy songs on which it is just Elvis and his guitar (with a bit of bass). Those are really quite enjoyable to me. He could do without a band."
3,what an average voice can't do,"The songs often plod along in mid-tempo malaise. File under other decent songwriters with a so-so voice (see Jay Farrar, Beck, Will Oldham, John Darnielle, Jason Molina...). What Clem Snide might sound like without Eef Barzelay's transcendent voice, or without Conor Oberst's grainy, youthful desire. Notables: ""Good Friday,"" ""While You Were Sleeping"""
5,Cool Stuff,"Due to the fact that Australia is isolated form the rest of the world, we tend to be much more Alternative. Think Alternative is to Australia as what R&B is to America. This means that if you want hard Iron Maiden...go somewhere else but this album i found was quite deep and Bernard Fanning's voice is a lot more melodic than your average rock band's giving The Finger a much more individual sound. Personally I think that Powderfinger wouldn't be where they are now without Bernard's vocals."
4,Great Album,"Thoughtful, rocking, and poetic all in one. This is a great album, although comparisons to radiohead are inevitable, this group still has a sound all of its own. Great vocals as well. Dan."
2,boring...,"I see all these 5 star reviews and it confuses me. You can not tell me that this is better than 'Internationalist'? I know they were going for a lighter, more subdued sound but this is just boring. Most of the songs are too simplistic and repetitive. Not to say all songs are bad, ""waiting for the sun"", ""up and down and back again"" and ""the metre"" have their moments. ""My happiness"" is sooooo overated. I get the feeling in 10 years time i'll still be listening to 'Internationalist' and their harder grungier effort 'Double alergic' while 'Odessey number 5' is collecting exuberent amounts of dust."
2,so so..,"Powderfingers two previous albums showed a band that was progressing from their grunge roots. This is the album were I see the band slowing down. Its not that the songs are bad or anything, but the variety and edge are missing. Tracks like ""my kind of scene"" and ""these days"" use the same formula on their ""Internationlist"" album. The rest of the tracks are so..so, just pleasant enough but nothing that will make me pay attention and play them over again. That said, track 10 ""Thrilloilogy"" is by far the most interesting cut on this album and I would like to see the band explore that direction a little more.Like I said, not a terrible album and this is a hard working, sweet band that is still better than a lot of junk that pollutes Aussie radio."
2,Rewind,"People keep going on about Powderfinger, telling you to buy this? Tell 'em to stick it - this is probably their worst album, not counting 'Parables For Wooden Ears', their debut. There's only two Powderfinger albums worth the salt: 'Double Allergic' and 'Internationalist'. If you have to pick between THOSE two, go for the latter. In short, don't bother with this."
1,Bad cd,"Don't get me wrong. I think Powderfinger have talent but REST OF WORLD PAY ATTENTION, DONT BUY THIS ALBUM AND MAKE THEM SUCCESSFUL YET. THEY NEED TO EARN IT. This cd is so boring and 'safe'. Some over polished basic rock which shows none of their talent. I hope they make it overseas one day but not with this terrible cd. It makes the world a worse place and lowers any person who owns it's value as a human being."
5,BUY IT,"Six years and four albums later and the guys from Brissie have done it. This album's five star calibre ironically serves to reveal its only flaw -- too short! Don't get me wrong, not one song is wasted - its lacking length has nothing to do with that 'skip' button. But 45 minutes (and 26 seconds) is always too short for an album of such superior sounds. Saying that though, the choice of song order and compilation is superb and it has an overwhelmingly 'rounded' feel to it. Bernard Fannings' vocals unfailingly reach the perfect pitch. This, layered over the brilliant cheoreography of instrument encapsulate the real, the raw, and the moving emotion that is Powderfinger. Like a good wine, their sound has matured and indeed, perfected, over time."
4,Close to their best,"One could argue whether this album is better than Vulture Street, but I still can't concede that. What it does offer is a quantum leap from previous work in melodic groove, song writing, and a heightened maturity of the band in almost every facet. The grungers will say it's too mainstream, but it wasn't really meant for them---as most of the Fingers work wasn't either. This is the album that sends Powderfinger in the direction they ultimately wanted to go. There are CLASSIC songs here ""Waiting For The Sun"", ""My Happiness"", ""Up & Down & Back Again, ""My Kind of Scene, ""We Should Be Together Now, etc. This is a must buy if you're just tapping into Powderfinger. You won't be sorry."
2,The weakest link,"This album is very overated and pales in comparison to thier previous efforts, Internationalist and Double Alergic. The song writing just isn't ambitious enough. ""The metre"" and ""Up and down and back again"" are the only songs that really grabbed me. The rest of it is just non-threatening formulaic pub rock. Powderfinger could reach the heights of Radiohead if they wanted to. Hopefully Vulture Street will be an improvement."
4,Develops Slowly,"Although the first half of this four-hour film is slow going, it does--like a good Russian novel--introduce and develop the two principal characters, so that by the time Part 2 rolls along, we know them, appreciate them, and get drawn into the wonderfully meaningful adventure that is their flawed and virtuous life together. [I would have liked to have known where in Poland's current geography this 1863 to 1914 saga occurred. During these years, Poland had been partitioned/annexed between Prussia (in the west), Russia (in the east), and Austria (in the south)]."
3,Polish Historical Epic,"This is a VERY long film (over four hours), and the fragmented chronology often leaves the viewer confused, especially if he or she is not familiar with Polish history from the mid-19th century through the early 20th century. The two leads - Jadwiga Baranska and Jerzy Binczycki - are both very good, although neither aged particularly credibly, as the aging process was pretty much limited to their hair turning gray - not much in the way of wrinkles or added weight. Very nicely photograhped, it's a movie for those who like sweeping historical films."
2,Bad Service,Took forever for this to arrive and then one disk was bad; seller never acknowledged but Amazon eventually gave a refund.
1,Rock and Roll War Stories,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately it is a complete waste of time, amateurishly written, and I wish I could return it. I threw this book in the garbage the night after I received it. It just does not live up to the hype. The author and co-author sure seem to have big egos for someone most people have never heard of. I've since canceled my order for Kiss and Tell as it is written by the same person."
1,Save your money,Total crap. Cobbled together interviews and 3rd person stories and ugly half or more naked women at the beginning chapters. Not worth a dime. Maybe G. Gordon can get back in with Ace cause his other stories suck
5,"Excellent book, especially for other 1.5 generation Asian Americans","Someone who is ""1.5 Generation"" is someone who immigrated to America at a very young age, not quite 1st generation and not quite 2nd generation. This book is excellent for those like me, who are of this generation.I completely agree with Smallchief's review. Half of the book is a quick history of the American involvement in Vietnam and the refugee process that followed that period.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a 1.5 generation immigrant from Vietnam or who has any close friends or family from this group."
2,Do NOT buy the Pink,"It's not pink, it's more of a dull red. The worst part is when the emergency lights (almost the same color) go on in the ISS you are practically invisible. Vyacheslav told me that I couldn't wear it back the next time, for safety reasons. Right, like there are a lot of other space stations I can wear it on. I was going to give it one star just for that, but it gets two because the air connector is really easy to disconnect."
2,You can get better cheaper.,"Granted, this is a low end Nike watch, I have a higher end Nike watch. I also have an Ironman Watch. I like the Ironman watches and you can get an Ironman watch that has these features for about $20. Also, I had to send the first watch back. The backlight would not go off and no data (time/date or other features) worked or could be shown. So all I had was a blank backlit watch. However, despite my negative review and the issue of the watch (broken, however probably an isolated incident), I decided for a replacement vice a refund. And Amazon.com did a great and quick job fixing the situation. We'll see how this watch works out. I kept the watch not for the functions, more so so I can rotate with my other watches and it has a pretty good look."
2,not for ladies,"I bought this watch to give my sister as a birthday gift. However, I am totally disappointed. This is very big for girls:(( I will send this back to amazon."
5,Couldn't have passed without it,The most authentic study material out there. Will almost guarantee success at the real CCIE Security Lab exam.
1,Over-written and poorly researchd,"I had high hopes for this book, but there were so many factual errors and overly flowery passages that I couldn't even finish it. The author must have only a very superficial knowledge of the Columbia system, Indians of the Northwest and the geography and geology of the area. The characters don't make make much sense beyond the obvious stereotypes, and his understanding of the wild salmon issues is deeply flawed. His understanding of the Hanford reservation is ludicrous. This is the most disappointing book I have read in years."
1,Awful!,"This book was a complete waste of effort. After trying to start it 3 times, I finally made it through the book. Really, I'm telling you, it is a waste of time. The characters are one not believable at all. Who in the world believes a white supremist having a relationship with an Indian woman after insulting her and her race? And why would she continue to be in love with him when he is killing himself in a terrorist attack?"
2,Disappointing (SPOILER ALERT!)...,"I really expected to like this book. I like John Hockenberry's work on NPR, and the subject matter is near and dear to my heart. But the novel just doesn't work very well. I think the author tries to weave 3 or 4 ideas too many into the plot, and the story and characters suffer as a result. The characters end of being cartoony, their motivations end up being very sketchy and unconvincing, and by the end I just didn't really care what happened. And as another reviewer points out, Mr Hockenberry glosses over an aftermath of immense contamination and suffering.The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that his writing style and descriptions of scenery are good. Alas, that's not enough."
1,Don't waste yout money!,"A third grader would have done better research. The geography, history, politics, and understanding of the Northwest was so bad I thought at first it was written to be a farce. As I read further I realized this guy was serious. Unfortunately a good plot was populated with shallow characters who are caricatures of what New Yorkers must think of Indians, survivalists, farmers, and government workers. All are insulted. If the author had even bothered to get a map it would have helped considerably. He had locations in the wrong states, government agency responsibilities so screwed up it is laughable. He twisted history so badly it even contradicts itself in the book."
1,An Easterner View of the Northwest,"Don't buy A River Out Of Eden. Thankfully, I borrowed the book so I am not guilty of supporting Hockenberry's poorly researched Easterner view of us backwards NorthWesterners. The geography is wrong, the history of the Columbia / Snake River dams is inaccurate, the hierarchy of Northwest Power System and Salmon Recovery Program is totally incorrect and the plot muddled. It is clear that Hockenberry is making a political statement, but even at that he could have taken time to research his subject matter and included a plot."
3,Is It Me?,"It could be me, but the beginning of this song sounds suspiciously similar to Nirvana's ""Heart Shaped Box"" to me. Not that I'm suggest Limp Bizkit can't write music or anything. ;)"
1,TRITE TRITE TRITE,"I've gotta say that I was really looking forward to reading this book as a close friend of mine is really great friends with the author. I was horrified to find that this book I'd really looked forward to was just awful! Swearing, drinking, ""almost got some"" priests??? Sheesh. The main character is prickly to the point that you wish it was her, not her uncle, on her last legs. Yes, there were some touching moments in it toward the end if you could dredge that far through it... But I also slow down and check out car accidents while driving by... I do realize that this is the authors first novel, but could someone have at least had the courtesy to explain to her what run on sentences are, and more importantly how to avoid them?? If you don't believe me, just check out the back cover -- it's just one HUGE run on. To anyone that's actually finished this book like i did still hoping beyond hope it'd get better, stand up and cheer for yourself! You've accomplished a mighty feat."
3,"Very Good Story Line, But...","I enjoyed the theme of this book. It drove home many things that are important in our relationships with family and friends. Close friends always remain close. Just beware - this author likes to use the ""F word"" very liberally, which seems to contradict the main character being a reputable lawyer. The story would have been an excellent one, if not for the language. Also, it is evident from her writing that the author is not particulary fond of her Catholic upbringing. As a Catholic christian, I was offended. I finished the book only because it was a good story. I would not read another book by this author, strickly because of the profanity."
3,It's all eerily accurate,"I'm from the Coal Region where Appollo's novel is set and I can truthfully say her descriptions of the town where her characters are from are eerily accurate. Meaning anyone who grew up in or near Shenandoah, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, would instantly identify the places she describes. Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church and it's yearly Italian festival. The necropolis situated at the end of ""The Heights"". The economically depressed, alcoholism-ridden, chain-smoking, culm-pile-pitted swatch of eastern Pennsylvania from where the author sprang is sadly, poignantly described. Perhaps her plot work and character development are not particularly stunning, but for me, who attended high school with lots of ""good kids"" from ""Shendo"" (and who surprisingly reminded me of the fictitious personalities in this novel), this was a very enjoyable read."
1,A very disappointing experience and a waste of money.,"Long, long disjointed sentences made for extremely difficult reading. Very uncreative writing; the characters have been plagarized from dozens of similar novels and movies from the 50s-60s era. Story hop-scotches all over the place, making it necessary to go back and re-read sections. Heroine's sense of self-importance throughout becomes boring."
5,a poignant book about enduring friendship,"Many wonderful, applicable things were said about this book in earlier reviews....what I'd like to add is the strength of feeling I came away with after finishing the last, wrenching page. The belief that friendships can endure, despite distances of emotion and time....this is just one of many ""feelings"" for a reader to ponder in this story. I loved having my own buried feelings awakened in the pages of Ms. Appollo's funny, sad and memorable novel."
3,3 and 1/2 Stars,"This is not a bad book, but for an Arthur C. Clarke novel, it is something of a disappointment. Although the concept of sub-plots is common in Clarke's works (and indeed, in all of science fiction) it is taken too far here. The whole long sections about the M-Set, the Millennium Bug, the inventions of Roy Emerson, and the homelife of the Craig family have no relevance to the actual plot of the book, and those sections encompass the heart of the book. Yes, the M-Set is interesting, but it should've been allowed it's own book if it is this important (even a 15+ page essay on it is included after the story). Meanwhile, the Titanic saga is relegated to almost side story status. Now, don't read all that and think I didn't like the book. I did. It's just that most of Clarke's other works are so much better (even the oft-critized 3001). Not a bad Clarke, but for the love of God don't start your collection here. Spring for Childhood's End, 2001 or 2010, or Rendezvous With Rama first."
4,The Story of Raising the Titanic from where She Lies.,Arthur C Clarke's story telling comes out in one of his best story's containing more information as well as keeping the book running at a glorious rate. If you want to know about the M-Set or if -3 does have a square root you will find it here.Of course the main plot is of raising the hulk that is the Titanic and of Natures way of thwarting even the most detailed plans by not one but two corporations.He does like to skin dive and this is probably something he thought about himself in his own way.My rating of seven is for the story an extra point or two should be added for the extra information on the M-Set and the Square Root of -3.If you can find it consider buying it I bought it for 1.25 about $3. which is a bargain for this type of book.
2,Better than no Clarke at all...................,"I like a flawed Arthur C. Clarke tale better than none at all. I know this is not a very strong sentiment in favor of this novel, but this work is not one of the author's best. There are glimpses of Clarke's genius and traces of his understanding of character. All in all, the book is not very exciting (I know there are those who would say this comment probably says more about the reviewer than the work of the reviewed). The novel centers on the attempt to raise the Titanic. There are interesting parts, specifically the methods by which the Titanic will be raised. Other sections, including the foray into mathematical hypothesis, seem out of context and for the hardcore sci-fi fan. If you are an Clarke disciple give it a try, but if you are looking to read him for the first time try another of his novels, Childhood's End, for example."
2,Mars Needs Women!,"Well, maybe not Mars, but some sort of mutant/alien/supernatural creature/force/entity needs women. For what, we don't know, nor do we ever learn. Nor do we (somewhat surprisingly) get the expected exploding alien-baby from the body (a la Alien, Humanoids from the Deep, and a dozen others you could probably rattle off if you thought about it).There's really not much to this film. It doesn't even have a lot of camp value. There is some, though: The breeders only take virgins and somehow in the midst of the metropolis (New York), all the female actors, from the teen dancer/ingenue to the 30-something doctor to the 60+ bag lady are all virgins.But ultimately there's not much =there= there. The 1980 ""Humanoids From The Deep"" has a similar plot and a lot more camp value (and Doug McClure) if you're looking for something like this."
3,YOU CAN'T FAIL ART,"This film also goes by the title ""Deadly Instincts"". An alien monster and his semi-reluctant human female companion (Kadamba Simmons) crash land in what appears to be a meteor. The alien and girl inhabit the depths of an all-girl school, which is an important plot point as the alien is looking for breeding material.The art teacher (Todd Jensen) is having an affair with a student (Samantha Womack). Jack (Richard Harrington), the young janitor also has an eye for the girls.While this is not the best alien creature/young girl film out there, it is not the worse. The creature itself wasn't half bad for a low budget film. The script and dialogue was passable.Parental Guide: Shower nudity, including full frontal"
2,Cool Looking Creature That Needs A Better Script,"A meteor crash lands on earth with alien and woman that was obducted, alien lures coeds into the underground to breed a new terror of species. Good creature design and good amount of screen time. movie could use a better script and have more action. I think this is a remake from an 80's movie by the same name, the original from the looks of it was worse than this."
1,The worst movie ever,"This movie was so horrible that even Mystery Science Theater 3000 wouldn't touch this one. I rented it by accident, but the movie was so horrible that it took all of my willpower just to sit though it!"
4,"Good but, ive seen better, it's like the top of the B movies","I liked most of the movie. But, it fits alot of the typical horror movie plot scheems, you always know whats going to happen.Note: If you see this DVD in the store, you will notice that the womans is a mirror image of the one in the screen image, they flipped the picture around so then can have the upc and all the screen shots on the binder side."
4,MATT'S THE MAN,"Matt McColm is a former stuntman who has done a few films including this above-average low budget thriller. McColm plays a bodyguard for hire, aided by his nerdish accountant, the ever ubiquitous Clint Howard. Along the way he encounters his lovely ex-girlfriend played by Annabell Schofield, and the spider lady Morgan Brittany, who plays the evil assistant to the even more evil Ron Perlman. Perlman plays the villain with a casual offhandedness that would later aid him greatly in the campy HELLBOY.In this film, McColm must stop Perlman from his devious plot: he manufactures a nasty virus, and then to make money, he makes the antedote. Cool way to make millions, huh? Things go pretty bad when McColm foolishly shakes Perlman's hand and gets the virus and has only 48 hours to stop Perlman.Cheesy in some ways, but McColm has a strong, slightly sardonic delivery and the action scenes are pretty effective.Not bad for a cheepo."
5,Better than I thought!,"I really thought that this movie would be a total waste of time but surprise! It turned out to be quite entertaining. Hey, it cost less that $1 mil to make so what do you expect? The performances were good and the action sequences were really good for a low budget feature. Jack Gill did a lot with what he had to work with, imagine if he had $10 mil to work with! You should see it, just to check it out!"
1,"Ron Pearlman, you have forsaken me!","This movie is like a porno.. but without nudity, and without the good music. It's loose plot follows a body gaurd (Matt McColm) trying to protect his client from... well.... I guess this film. He does a poor job, because she's in it. In the end, they do battle with Ron Pearlman, who's bad for one reason or another. Maybe he's pissed he didn't get paid enough, or maybe he didn't pay the filmakers enough to not be in this film. Either way, he's pissed, and out to destroy the world. The camerawork looks like a guy holding the camera with one hand, and lifting weights with the other. Consquently, the camera is never really steady. If you paid the full amount for this DVD, or for that matter, any amount, I suggest you ask for a refund."
3,Good emery cloth -- bargain compared to hardware store prices,"I used to buy emery cloth from a local hardware store, one or two sheets at a time; the most expensive choice. This no-brand emery cloth isn't quite up to, say, the 3M quality level, but for the price, it's a real bargain. 3M cloth from Amazon is 3.5 times more costly than this product, but isn't 3.5 times as good, and it doesn't last 3.5 times longer. The only obvious difference: 3M cloth has a tighter weave.I've been using this cloth on wood and metal for several years, and it works just fine. You can rip off a strip or small piece and, just like any good emery cloth, it's much tougher than any paper-based sandpaper. I was a bit nervous about buying 50-sheet packs of various roughness, but when it's finally gone, I'll buy more just like this..."
1,Dodging Terrorism,"How dare she! I too was in an abusive relationship, with no where to go and only my husband for financial support. It started with insulting pet names to degrading names to pushes and then to slaps. When I noticed that my children continued playing when their father slapped me, I knew I had to go before this got out of hand. Even allowing them to see me get abused was abusing them. But you get out. You save your child. How this monster of a woman can still pretend after all these years that she cared about Lisa is sickening. Please read, ""What Lisa Knew"". She saw Lisa as her rival and had no love for her. She and Joel were two sick crack addicted junkies, who enjoyed their sick game of Master and slave and unfortunately bought children into their sick lives as well."
1,Complicit in the girl's murder,"These reviews sound like a revisitation of 1970s feminism (complete with foreword by the worthless Gloria Steinhem), always ready to exonerate women as ""victims."" I thought a better outcome for feminism was to give women power and responsibility. She is just benefitting from Lisa's death and finding a way to be forgiven for her complicity in the children's torture. If someone hits you, YOU LEAVE. If you think that person is godlike, then you're sick and you need help. If you say he made you into a helpless victim, then you're a liar and beyond help. Poor Hedda! NO, POOR LISA!! Now, go ahead and rank this review as ""not helpful,"" enablers of child murderers."
1,hopefully nobody buys this-,"For a murderer to gain any profit from her crime is ludicrous. You may as well buy a book written by OJ Simpson. Hedda has a cozy place in hell waiting for her, alongside Joel.Negative 50 stars.Lisa, honey--I hope you are resting in peace."
1,What kind of toy is this??,"It's so boring and STUPID!! I'm (...)and my little sister is 8. We got this toy and we were supposed to share. Well, neither of us uses it! It's so pathetic! Who can have fun with something like that?!"
2,2.5 ! give this a True 2.5,"What fun is this??? I mean, like, WOW hopw lame is this??? You can't style the hiar, WICH IS HALF THE FUN!!! Now don't get me wrong, I think this is a verry Beautyfull Styling-head. But why whould you want STYLING-HEAD THAT YOU CAN't DO THE HAIR??? Bielive me you're better of getting the Jade one, even thogh it has Blue-Greenish Lips. :)"
2,EEK!!!,These Live in Concert heads are gross! They have gross colored/dyed hair and their lips are REALLY weird they have like checkerd lips!EEEEEWWWWW!!!!! Am I terribly mistaken or are they scary? Thay look like something you would see on Halloween!! I liked MGA's old styling heads MUCH better! P.S. I averaged out my rating and I got 2.2
5,"The Descendants of Elisha Estes, 1752-1839","I need this book, mine was borrowed and not returned. Excellent book about my family."
1,Worst shampoo I've ever used!,"This was by far the most drying, damaging, awful shampoo I've ever used, and I once used the awful Ivory brand shampoo they had briefly in the late 80's. I stopped using this over a month ago when I realized what it was doing to my hair, and it still isn't back to its previous condition. The conditioner is so-so, I'll use that til it's gone but I will not use the rest of the shampoo and that is saying a lot for me, I never waste anything and I only bought this because it was 50% off. Do not buy the Shea Butter shampoo unless you want to go as a bale of hay for Halloween."
2,Not a fan,"This shampoo was horrible. It lathers nice and smells great, but afterwards my hair felt like straw. The conditioner isn't as bad, but is no better than any other conditioner out there. Even if this was only $5 I would not ever buy it again."
2,Too expensive for such poor quality,"For a bottle of moisturizing shampoo that cost $19.95 for 8 oz., it drys out my hair an awful lot. The ONLY thing I liked about this product was the smell. I can not believe how dry my hair was after using the shampoo and the conditioner. I could have went to the dollar store and bought a bottle of the $.99 Suave they sell there and would have had the same results. What a waste of money."
3,like the shampoo not the conditioner,I'm out to sea and the water on the ship is very rough on my coarse hair. I used this shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo smells nice and doesn't lather as much as i like but it leaves your hair feeling very soft. The conditioner i wasn't a big fan Fekkai Gloss conditioner is a lot better
3,Editorial Reviews,"Reviewer Catherine Witmer from Romantic Times Magazine (04/02) gives this book three stars and had this to say about this volume of Duets, ""Talented Patricia Knoll's PERK AVENUE is as sweet as its heroine's special desserts, with engaging characters"" and ""Newcomer Jennifer McKinlay's TO CATCH A LATTE is fresh and funny, with memorable characters and snappy byplay""."
5,The truth finally comes out about education,"I have known that there are many problems in our high schools, but no one has ever talked about them till now. This book tells how high school is just wasting valuable time for kids and giving them innumerable worries and stresses by having to have to learn things that will never again be used in life. I think that high school should be geared toward an individual's plan for a future occupation. This book is a must read for anyone who has ever thought about this subject before!"
1,Botstein isn't as smart as he appears,"Having heard Botstein speak and having had the opportunity to question some of his beliefs it became clear to me that his proposal is more a random thought than a well thought out idea. Sure, Botstein manages to write a book filled with great words, most of which are unknown the majority of the population in this country, but he fails to aknowledge one, huge problem in his idea. His idea is based more off of physical maturity than mental maturity. I think it's absurd to assume that students are maturing mentally at a faster pace, or even an equal pace to those 30 years ago. The fact of the matter, students generally don't have to mature that fast because of their lives at home, and those who do often turn to drugs or violence. That's just the way I feel."
3,Maps,Detailed map of Virginia during the war and a detailed map of the Gettysburg battlefield would have been helpful. It was difficult to follow the action with only a verbal description of the battle.
1,A Walton's Christmas: Together Again,It was not the CD we expected. We thought we had ordered the origianl Waltons' Christmas which we have in vinyl.
5,This CD is a must for all Waltons fans!,"I have had this CD for less than a week and have already listened to it several times. It was produced by Jon Walmsley (Jason on The Waltons) and it features nearly every member of the TV family. There are old Christmas favorites as well as original songs written, I assume, by Jon. Earl Hamner gives a short Christmas message, Richard Thomas reads Clement Clarke Moore's ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"", Michael Learned reads the Biblical account of Christmas from Luke 2, Ralph Waite tells a Christmas story in song to the Walton grandchildren, and much, much more! I highly recommend this CD to all fans of The Waltons."
4,Waltons --,"You will enjoy this album, especially if you enjoyed the ""Waltons"" on television! The cast joins in and reminded me a lot of some of the songs that Jason wrote on the show and sang. A great Christmas gift!"
3,Origin Of Urantia Papers.,"A must read for Urantia Book students, as it is one of only a few in-depth studys & research into the Urantia Foundation members and the actual Revelations reception.It is collated as a Logue of events pertaining to the reception of the Revelation, heavily appendicted, rather than a flowing read, with the Author failing in his attempt to not add or take away from the contents of the actual Revelation by endorsing his own opinions.Introduces Urantia Book students to the Custodial battle that has thwarted its reception.Therefore as an in-depth but in-complete study, of Urantia Foundation members and particulars of the Revelations arrival, it is deserving of an A.All opinions cast by the Author regarding the Revelations contents, should be viewed with a knowledge of the Authors backround.Should be read in Conjuction with the Urantia Book."
5,"A Brave, Necessary Work","Ignore the pinhead negative reviews below. ""Camille"" has likely not read much of the Urantia Book, and the other sneering review you can just swat like an annoying mosquito. I came to the UB some fifteen years ago. I am 50 now and have never read anything even remotely like it. It is difficult, to say the least, but the ring of truth in it is loud and clear, despite the many questions that it raises. As this space is not a forum, I won't go into details about the problems with the UB. But those of you who actually READ and CONSIDER the UB will need Mr. Moyer's book. Don't let no-count simpletons dissuade you from pursuing the TRUTH. The Birth of a Divine Revelation is a brave, living thing. Don't miss it."
2,..//..,"This is my least favourite Meat Puppets album (""Golden Lies"" is not included). It sounds very uninspired, no standout songs or musical moments, just a bunch of songs that pretty much sound the same. Curt Kirkwood is a great guitar player but here are no good riffs or solos. Also the bass lines and drums are mediocre as well as the lyrics and vocals. ""Forbidden Places"" and ""Too high to die"" are better choices in my opinion, if you're interested in their 90's period."
2,Their worst album,"Definatly a subpar offering from one of the 80s best bands. The first three tracks are really the only competant songs on this record, which is quite a shame. Oh well, any band that has as many great records as the Puppets do are bound to have a few bad ones. This isn't terrible, it's just boring and emotionless, which as two things their SST output can certainly not be accused of. I haven't listened to this one since I first got it. The last actual Meat Puppets album (""Golden Lies"" is more of a Curt Kirkwood solo album). At least the cover is cool."
3,Sort of OK with a little work,"Reviewing the specs it is evidently exactly the same unit as the slightly cheaper model that doesn't advertise ""long handle"". The handle is ridiculously short and skinny. I would think the object of the dustpan is to avoid having to bend over to sweep up dirt. That would only work for a midget.I managed to extend the handle with a piece of PVC pipe and a connector. That makes it easier to grip as well as long enough to not have to bend over. The way it is made it would be difficult to attach a better handle you might have laying around.My unit came without the advertised rubber on the edge - it is just plain sheet metal. That works OK, but it is junky. It also came covered with dust and grime. I don't think this vendor is particularly reliable."
1,Expired Item,"I had received an expired item, 04/11.I purchased it on 12th of May.I had been cheated."
1,Background music way too loud,"After reading the Amazon reviews and seeing that this recording won a Grammy, I was expecting much better. I love Robin Williams but he speaks to fast for children 10 and under. The story was boring for my children and for me and I like audiobooks. The background music was EXTREMELY loud and takes away from the story. You can barely hear the story.I do NOT recommend. Try and find another version about Pecos bill."
5,Pure Genius Songwriting,"Nathan Larson, guitarist of Shudder to Think, is the mastermind behind this brilliant record, perhaps my favorite of all time. I hesitate calling it a side project, for at times this album surpasses anything in the masterful S2T history. If you appreciate original (if a little unusual) songwriting, freshly poetic lyrics, and a record for all seasons, order this now. Its only flaw is that it should be longer."
2,Mediocre at best--and a BIG disappointment for a Mary T fan!,"I'm not sure what the raves below are about, but I will admit that I've never been particularly impressed with Shudder to Think. I don't ""get"" them, so maybe that's why I don't get this album. It's not that terrible, but there's very little to motivate me to play it more than once or twice. It's wallpaper music, and nothing more.If your primary motivation for buying this CD is that you're a Mary Timony fan like me, I strongly suspect you'll be as disappointed with it as I was. The only hint that Mary's even on the album are hints of spacey guitar and keyboard riffs that are unmistakably hers and frustratingly buried background vocals on one track. I suppose I should have done my homework before buying the disk, but with Mary's unique voice, I assumed it would be prominently featured if not as leads, then significant backups. Nope."
4,I have it on repeat.,"This is an album for waking up on a Saturday morning, enjoying a home-brewed cup of coffee while looking out the window of your Parisian apartment, observing the murmuring heads of those passing by. My favorite songs include ""Quatre nuages"", ""Le capitaine et le matelot"", and ""La fille d'Avril."" As a newcomer to both the French lifestyle, music, language, and culture - this album has both a spunky and romantic catchiness that makes a barely-speaking-French-individual feel wrapped up in it. If you like Alan Parson's Project, you'll probably like this album."
2,Not his Best,"Don't get me wrong, I love Bruce Cocburn. I have 10+ of his Albums/CDs. But I have to admit that this is one of only 2 recordings of his which I do not listen to regularly. The lyrics are good as almost all of his are, but this album never grabbed hold of me. Too many songs left me waiting for the next one to start. So unless you are completing a BC collection, I would pass on this one and try another."
2,Kiplings Poems...,"I thought it was a poor selsction, without his most famous, ""If"" included. The illustrations were like those from a newspaper, and it's overall content was not great."
3,For the Average photographer,"I am NOT the technical type, but this is just a basic set. There is a slight difference in the pictures. When I used the wide angle lens, I had a black mark in each corner, very slight, but noticable. I was told that my camera could be unaligned or it might be the lens."
1,Olympus Lens Set,"""NOTHING BUT PURE JUNK"" !!!!! I gave it a "" 1 "" rating because that was the lowest!!!!!!!Does not produce pictures as the advertise !!!! I've tried every setting on my Olypmus C750 using the above items and I've had nothing but fuzzy pictures !!!!!!!!"
1,Horrible packaging--bottle less than half full!,"Just opened package--one lousy piece of brown paper inside to ""protect"" contents. Bottle cap was not screwed on tight, product leaked out and I have less than half a bottle. I can't imagine who passed this through the packaging inspection. For 11.50 I would hope for at least the 16 oz. as the bottle states. Would like a replacement or refund."
2,Leaky Mug,The mug I purchased has a lid with a swivel slider that is supposed to seal it. This one allows almost as much liquid through when closed as it does when open. I have had other mugs in the past that did not leak.The handle is also not ergonomic. It is too skinny to fit comfortably in my hand.
5,Zoeller Sump Pump,"I have always used this product bought at my local plumbing supply house, however Amazon's price was lower and included free shipping.. good reliable pump, mine is on 24/7 365 days a year.. and it lasts almost 2 years ..pumps out water all year long .."
2,Not as good as advertised,After 6 months my M53 would stop working periodically. Fortunately I checked and found that it did not turn on. The water level was just above the top of the pit. The pump would turn on when I tapped it and then would run normally again for a while. What if I'm not home to check on it?
1,Don't buy this product,"My M-53 pump quit after being installed for a little over a year. (Right, just out of warranty!) When I called the plumber who recommended and installed the unit he told me that he no longer recommends Zoeller because he is seeing a lot of them fail afterbeing in use for 2 years and less.I don't know about you, but I expect a sump pump to last more than a year! Zoeller, are you listening? What's the deal here?"
5,Zoeller M53 sump pump,very good quality. only sump pump i would buy. my pump runs a lot so i keep a replacement switch handy.
5,Excellent product Buy TOGETHER with Valve,"I recommend buying both parts together if you are replacing your sump pump.The valve keeps the water from backing up adding needed extra life and proper working orderto the sump pump itself. I have had it now for 2 months, installed it myselfand it was very easy to do (if you know what you are doing) and worksproblem free. I love the solid construction. Good buy for the money!"
2,Switch Failure,"My M53 also experienced a switch failure to the ""on"" position after having it in use for approx. 2 1/2 yrs. When operating as advertised, the pump activates frequently due to it having limited float height travel. The variable float model BN53 seems to have much improved longevity (less switch failures) due to the different switch type based on reviews that I've recently read. Moving up to the M98 based on reviews, maybe the on/off switch will work better."
2,cheap switches,"i have owned several Zoeller pumps. They all have the same problem: cheap switches that fail in a couple of years. Im going to purchase a different model/brand that does not have a mechanical switch. Another problem with these pumps: they draw 14 amps of current when they start up and that can trip the circuit breaker if anything else is running. I have this problem many times. THere are better pumps out there that draw less amps and pump more water,"
1,Float switch system fatally flawed,"We have gone through 3 Zoeller M53 's in 4 years, the first two had float switch failures a little less then a year in. This last time we had the float switch fail after a year and a half. Just installed a Flotech replacement with a separate float buoy system, we'll see how that goes. Bottom line, there is something very wrong with the float switch system on these sumps and because they are ""all in one"", the entire sump is useless once they fail."
1,not so mighty-mate pump,I purchased M-53 pump october 10 2010.the switch had to be shut off manualy.finaly the pump burned out.I did not listen to reviews about switch isues.do not buy this pump.
3,Worth the money but not any more.,"The switch is a problem. I had to ad weight to the arm so that it would shut off properly and not cycle on and off near the bottom of the pit. The switch would turn the pump off before it snapped down to the off position and when the water level rose an inch it would cycle right back on within 5 seconds and repeat this short cycle 5 to 20 times. This would drastically reduce the life of the pump and switch if left like that. I will probably order a new switch and try again, but my sump can't wait for the shipping times.The casing is showing a bit of rust after only a couple of days in service. I'm not convinced the coating was well done at the factory. I think Zoeller needs to step up the quality control. Otherwise, the pump is tough and quiet."
5,This is the one to get,"After researching the market this is the pump recommended by plumbers. It will work automatically as it, or can be retrofitted to other types of float switches."
1,Keep shopping for another remote,"I had the same issues as the first reviewer. The range is non-existent, and I frequently had to get out of my car to even get it to work. After about 2 years, one of the buttons got stuck and the transmitter will no longer link with the opener when I attempt to reprogram it. Do not buy this product unless you have no other options."
1,"Waste of money, buy the full size remote","I bought this remote thinking it would be nice to just have it on my keychain instead of a larger visor clip remote. Big mistake. The distance range is virtually nonexistant - I have to nose up to just inches from my garage door to make it work, and had to remove it from my keys so I could point it directly at the garage. I had to get out of my car this morning to close my garage door behind me because I'd backed in, and the length from my drivers seat to the back of the car is apparently stretching the range too far. I usually have to press the button 4 or more times to open the door... my advice? [...] And another handy piece of information that I didn't know until I received this product is that the seller won't take a return. Don't waste your money on this item."
3,Too violent for me,"Through this book I learned a lot about the Pacific islands and the culture of the people who inhabited them. I enjoyed the story and Peterkin kept it interesting (he's hilarious) but I found it to be rather slow as Ballantyne takes a great deal of time describing various plants and such. Also, while the lads are always doing something, for the first half of the book the story seemed to be going nowhere. The other thing that disturbed me was all the horrors Ralph, the narrator, witnesses in the various murders the natives commit. However, the book was otherwise very clean and I enjoyed that aspect and that God was given the glory for everything."
2,Mediocre and full of filler,"Like all Springsteen fans I was so excited that he was releasing a new album I pre-ordered the cd so I could have it as soon as it came out. Leading to my anticipation was his excellent tour he did with the reunited E Street band and some of the new material he did for those show. After having listend to this cd for over a year and catching him on tour last year I have to sayit's not that good. the stand out song is your missing, The rising, and into the fire. The rest ahhh. This record makes me think of Human touch. It sounds good the first couple of times you play it but you get bored with it quickly. The writing is just not that good. He continualy uses the same metaphors.And some of the songs (worlds apart are darn right embarrising).I know he can do much better then this."
5,The Best Album In The 2000's,"This Is Such A Great Album. One Of His Best By Far. This Is The Album That Should've Won Album Of The Year. My Favorite Song On Here Is ""Nothing Man."" Other Great Songs Are ""The Rising"", ""Lonesome Day"", ""You're Missing"", Just To Name A Few. Let's Hope He And E Street Band Keep Making Great Music."
5,Passion,"With a great modern mix and songs with amazing lyrics, This is Bruce's best album within the last decade in my opinion"
2,"Drink Coke, Eat McDonald's, Hear Springsteen","Ingredients: Dylan, Cocker, Hooker, King, sweat.Instructions: Put the disc in your Sony discman. Enjoy.Best before: 1980."
4,"It's great for young fans, but only good for old fans","The reason I say this is only great for young fans is because it's a typical rock and roll record that you can play in the car and sing along to. The likes of which we rarely see these days. But if youre an old fan and you were excited about The Boss bringing out new material (finally) then you could be disappointed by a couple of tracks. Y'see there isn't any room on an eagerly awaited album for 'filler tracks' yet 'The Rising' does have 'em. The title track is the strongest one on there and other favourites of mine are 'The Fuse' and 'Waiting On A Sunny Day.' You should buy it anyway, simply because I wouldn't be surprised if this isn't Springsteen's final record. He has the talent but just doesn't push himself. Sorry Bruce."
3,Springsteen can do better,"Too many people are just too happy that Springsteen have released a new album. That's the reason for the average rating of 4.5 stars!This album sounds very much like ""Human touch"" and ""Lucky town"". It's a decent Springsteen effort but the songs are not even close to the standard Springsteen showed on ""Born in the USA"", ""Tunnel of love"", ""The river"" or ""Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J."" With hindsight, I suppose this will be very clear."
2,What happened to The Boss?,"I love Springsteen, but this doesn't do it for me. This is the E-Street Band? Sounds like synthesizers and drum machines to me. Where's the rawness? Where's the heart? I'm writing this as I listen to it for the first time. I'm on track 8. Will it really turn around and kick me in the keester for the second half? I doubt it.I will review this again after I listen to the words, but the music doesn't do it.Sorry, Bruce."
4,REBORN IN THE U.S.A.,"1.LONESOME DAY- Even those who have it all get lonely. 3.WAITIN' ON A SUNNY DAY- More girls wear miniskirts. 4.NOTHING MAN- Not a Pearl Jam Cover; Nowhere Man, Pusherman, Solitary Man,Apeman, HEY MON! 5.COUNTIN' ON A MIRACLE- Miracles do happen! 6.EMPTY SKY- Smooth tune! 9.FURTHER ON UP THE ROAD- Rock with attitude. 10.THE FUSE- Thumper! 13.THE RISING- Great Job. 14. PARADISE- This tune is not about getting laid. 15.MY CITY OF RUINS- Inspiring, I hope Asbury Park makes a comeback to its GLORY DAYS because Tramps like us, Baby we were BORN TO RUNNNN!..."
2,Don't believe the hype,"There's a couple of good songs, but a lot of it sounds very middle of the road. 9/11 is a very hard thing to write about, and having a multi-millionare sing in the voices of working class people who have suffered a very specific kind of loss is particularly awkward. He should've just written about it from his own perspective. Another thing is that he doesn't make much use of the E Street Band. Clarence Clemons is barely heard from, and counting Bruce, they've got three really good guitar players. Ideally the album should've sounded akin to Neil Young and Crazy Horse, with loud angry anthems and stark ballads. But most of it sounds like John Mellencamp outtakes. Instead of sounding like Bruce, he sounds like a guy who wants to be Bruce."
5,Refreshing ROCK Record,"In the age of mainstream boredom such as Creed, Matchbox 20, and Korn. And in the dawn of the nu trend, NU ROCK, such as The Strokes, The Hives, The Vines, and the White Stripes it is refreshing to have a real rock record that means something. We all know how we felt during those bad times almost a year ago and this record hits the mark. Thanks Bruce."
2,"Not Bad, but....","First of all, where is the E Street Band. This murky sounding mess has none of the great sax, guitar and piano play of the great E Street albums. It sounds like just studio musicians from the Human Touch era. If you want great classic Bruce, get the ""Live in NYC"" cd where the E Street Band does its thing.I was not expecting ""Born to Run"" (we'll never get that again)but it sure would be nice if Bruce would sing about things like barefoot girls sitting on the hood of a Dodge rather than big worldly events. Its Bruce and therefore better than most, but not great Bruce."
2,It's 'Tunnel of Love' Revisited - Sad and Sorry,"You'll have to rise above the hype and swim against the tide to proclaim just what a major disappointment this album is .. but, take heart; it can be done. Musically disjointed, lyrically self-congratulatory and smelling strongly of a publicity pose, ""The Rising"" is a misstep worthy of Springsteen's ""Tunnel of Love"" fiasco with little to recommend it except curiosity. Where's the passion we felt with ""Live in New York City""? Why bring back the E Street Band only to bury it in a melange of sappy strings and sonic garbage? Whose idea was it to exploit September 11 to sell this thing ... on the MTV Music Awards, ABC's ""Nightline"" and NBC's ""Today Show,"" no less? I've been a Springsteen fan since the beginning and this sub-average album makes me wonder whether it's time to be a lot more selective when it comes to his future efforts. It's starting to look and sound like product placement and brand marketing in BruceLand."
1,Political Fodder,"Bought it.. Heard it... Chucked it...Why do people have to be so damn political. Healing? Give me a priest, not some guy that sounds constapated.This album is all hype and no pay out, and you all just got suckered."
2,Warmed-over Human Touch with a big hype,"Don't believe the record company marketing, and don't buy into the 9/11 story. This sounds like our beloved Bruce is still in the mediocre song writing rut he has been in for the last few albums. There is nothing new here besides some Sting-like production and nice packaging. I really, really hoped for more, but I have to be honest about this one. The stuff is boring! The pop tunes sound like first attempts by beginners, and it goes down hill from there."
1,The Bore is back,"Here we go again. More overhyped third-rate music played as if someone just took too much uppers. And again, once you just listen to the music without the bombarding sound...it signifies nothing. Just gets more and more boring as he gets older. Okay, can a Jerseyite say that Bruce stinks!? So now he's taking on 9/11...that ought to make Ben Ladin quake in his boots, I'll bet ya.Bruce, go away already."
2,Better to Burn Out Than Fade Away,"When 20 year old Bruce managed to forward a demo tape to Peter Noone of ""Herman's Hermits"" in London, I doubt either of them knew where it would lead. From the haunting memento of his experience in Brisbane Psychiatric Hospital, the album gives a blueprint of the easy, poignant style Bruce is famous for."
5,FANTASTIC!!!,I saw Bruce Springsteen for the first time on the 'Born in the UAS' tour in the UK I wasnt a fan of 'The Boss' at the time but obtained a ticket from someone who couldn't go and he was the most fantastic artist I have ever seen!! I have recently bought 'The rising' album and feel that it is moving & heartfelt& has ignited my passion for Bruces music I have now booked tickets to see him in concert in the UK in 2003 & cant wait!!!!!
3,LYRICS ARE REPEATED A LOT / SONGS SOUND THE SAME,"I love Bruce and I appreciate what he is trying to accomplish with this album. Nevertheless, his lyrics are often uninspired. He sings about wanting his lover's kiss in many songs. He repeatedly talks about sunrises and an empty side of the bed. The songs are also melodically and harmonically similar. There are a couple of rockers, but most of the songs are slower ballads. The band's talent is not used to enhance the album and you really have to listen to hear the sax.Depite the failings of this album, it is still worth owning. Some of the lyric repetition actually gives a meditative quality to the songs. (Of course, other times the repition suggests a lack of originality.) Nevertheless, a mediocre album by Bruce is better than most artists can hope to accomplish. I won't be selling this to a used cd store."
3,"Ok, but nothing new here.","While I was looking forward to The Boss' new Cd, I was rather disappionted with the final product. It's easy enough to listen to, but lacks the fire of earlier efforts such as Born To Run or Born In The USA. Contributions from The E street Band are nearly non existant. Bruce could have used studio musicians and come out with the same CD. Only long time Bruce fans willl love this one. After 18 years, I expected more."
5,bruce does it again,"Bruce has written some truly amazing music in the past and this is no different. The Rising will definitely take its place along with Bruce's 3 or 4 most moving albums. Paradise, in particular is pure poetry."
1,exploiting terrorism,"Bruce has now and again written a song that is not entirely without substance, not not very often. It is just too hard to get past the sound of his alleged voice, and the sound of that souped up bar band from New Jersey. Apparently Bruce fans don;t care much, they are sucked in by something that I can not see, much the same way that hordes of the dim are drawn to N'sync and other talentless droids. This record waves the flag in an insidiously clever way. Anyone who writes songs exploiting the 9/11 disaster should be strung up."
1,Capitalizing on people's emotions,"I LIKED Springsteen, until this album came out. The idea of putting out an album ENTIRELY about 9/11 seemed awfully cheap, but I listened to it anyway. Weather you like ""the boss"" or not, this album, in my opinion, cheapens the lives of everyone that died that day. Make an album with one song about the national tragedy, you're compationate and you show the world how the day deeply affected you. Make an album where every song is about it, and the meaning seems less sincere with every track. And if it's a tribute album, why didn't all of the proceeds go to charities instead of in the Boss' pockets? Sorry, Boss, but you've forever lost this fan."
1,Boss or Loss (as in loss of hard-earned cash),"Does anyone really think Bruce can sing? Man, he has one of the worst voices of anyone in the history of music!"
1,The Miracle Did Not Happen,"Sorry Springsteen Fans. The miracle just did not happen for me on this one. The CD is too dark, too moody, too post 9-11. Even though that's an important date in our history, one we should never forget,the CD just brought me down and left me down. Every song sounded the same. The same beat the same lyrics. Too much fluff! The backgound vocals and music overshadowed Bruce's otherwise great voice. Burce should have stayed longer in the studio on this one. I don't know if BS is going to give the proceeds of this one to 9-11 causes or not, if he is then this CD might be worth buying, if not then don't bother he's only trying to make money on the situation. I had though about going to his concert, but based on this CD have decided to save my money and see Mellencamp instead."
2,Liked it less each time I listened to it,"I bought this album soon after it came out, and liked it at first. But, after listening to it for awhile, I started to like it less and less. IMO, not a good album by Springsteen. The best tracks on this are The Rising, Mary's Place, and Lonesome Day, and those songs are not that great. Quite a few of the songs are dreary, dull filler.If you're just getting into Springsteen's music, I recommend Born in the USA, Darkness on the Edge of Town or Born to Run. I wouldn't buy this album."
3,not what i had hoped,"I have been a fan of Bruce Springsteen since before I could drive. I really looked farward to this reunion with the E-Street Band but have come away disappointed. This collection of songs simply does not reach the heights to which it aspires. Yes, it captures much of the sense of loss from 9-11 but so do many other efforts out there. And, frankly, I guess we've come to expect more from Springsteen. May not be fair on him but there it is. I kept trying to find Clarence on this record --- where is he? ""meet me at Mary's place"" comes closest to finding the --- yes I hate to say it--- old E-Street groove and you can almost hear the saxophone... My city in ruin is a fitting tribute and a stirring song --- one of the fiercest things he has done, but sadly the rest of the record falls behind..."
4,"The cream, well, rises...","Let's face it -- giving this album 5 stars (as one reviewer here does) because Bon Jovi would have liked to have made this album is damning with very faint praise. And the inclusion of ""Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin)"" is reason enough to dock a star. The disappearance of Roy Bittan is worth another half -- so 3 1/2 stars, here, rounded up. All in all this is a solid anthemic album, with several truly great songs (Lonesome Day, Empty Sky, Worlds Apart, My City of Ruins), some good party songs a la The River (Mary's Place). Bruce settled a little too easily on ""la, la, la"" choruses, I think. But there are some terrific nuggets here, lyrically and musically, that both soar and niggle at you. Well worth a place in your CD changer."
4,The Boss has returned,"I picked this up not knowing what to expect,was I going to get the amazing rock tales of Born to Run, or the love songs of his 90' albums. Well I am glad to say it much more like Born to Run. With songs like Lonesome Day, Your'e Missing, and The Rising it gives hope for America and the world to rise up over the tragedies. Bruce is back and is the worhty one to bring songs about September 11th together on one album."
4,Excellent Work,"First off, to the ""music fan"" who thought the album was dark and whiney, and apparently has based their opinion on Bruce on the ""Live in New York City"" DVD---have you ever heard of the ""Nebraska"" album? Sure, this album has darkness about it, but Bruce's music always has, just like it has light moment, such as ""Mary's Place"".This album is fantastic. If any artist could talk about the post 9/11 world and do it justice and give it dignity, it's Bruce Springsteen. ""The Rising"" is a touching tribute to the firefighters and ""You're Missing"" is just absolutely haunting.The album should be picked up by all, but for those who remember Bruce for ""Glory Days"" and ""Born In The U.S.A"" only, and not noticing the body of work that exists, you might be disappointed."
4,"I'm not a big fan, but....","I have always been a ""luke warm"" Springsteen fan and have not bought anything by Bruce since Born In The USA. This is his best effort in a long time. He stands on the style of his old stuff while at the same time moves into new musical realms. A great example is the 7th track ""Worlds Apart"". The songs are gritty and passionate. For die hard fans, the returning fans and the new generation of fans, there is something for everyone on this disc."
4,Songs of loss and redemption,"The press keeps touting this as the saving grace for America and Bruce's answer to 9/11. While there certainly is reference to that event it is much more than that. This is a seminal performance by a recently dormant artist. There are 4 or 5 songs on this disc that are among Bruce's finest. Songs like ""You're Missing"", ""My city of Ruins"" and ""The Rising"" are sad and redemptive at the same time. ""Lonesome Day"" is a great song. While you can read Sept. 11th into almost any of these songs, You can also relate it to any tragic or defining moment in a life. This is a 50 year old man talking about mortality and vitality. This is Bruce's version of Dylan's Time out of Mind. Don't expect a repeat performance of any old E-Street album. Bruce is not going to make those albums again. He's changed and grown. We should all grow with him."
5,Bruce is back,"After a too-long break from recording a studio album with the E-Street Band, Bruce is back in a big way. Springsteen draws on his greatest strengths as a lyricist and puts together a great series of rock anthems, most focusing on life as it was affected by the attacks of September 11th (be prepared to get choked up with ""You're Missing"").The sound of the E-Streeters is unmistakable, vintage Springsteen. Some of the tunes (e.g. Mary's Place) could have jumped right out of the Thunder Road era.Here's hoping that the Boss is back for good."
3,Too long and too damn' patriotic,"With a shorter album and a critical distance t'wards Sep. 11 tragedy, Springsteen could have made a lasting statement of the event which would be viewd as an example of rock- the art form. Instead, he's going for immediate emotions, not wanting to scratch deeper under the surface, and doing that, he underestimates his audience. The music itself is perfect, but there are too many songs on this ONE subject that it gets boring towards the end. The Rising is a step back for Bruce but hopefully he will realise it and make a better and wider record next time."
5,Boss is indeed back!,"I am yet to get the CD but I have had the chance to record the concert on NBC's Today show yesterday (hey, I leave for work by the time the show begins), saw Bruce on Brian Williams (MSNBC), and ABC Nightline last night. So I have listened to at least 5 songs. What a comeback! USA reborn! This album could indeed make Americans feel proud to have such character. To have such deep sense of empathy and express what we all felt on or after Sep 11th through popular music is an art that only Bruce can showcase.I have always loved his deeper writings and this one is the best. It makes you feel that emotion all over again but in a way that you can move on with life and not be paralyzed. In a way your kids can listen to 25 years from now and still feel the same emotion. A masterpiece. A classic. It will be listened to for many many decades. Thanks Bruce. You are the Boss!Buy the CD. Mine is coming."
2,disappointed,I EXPECTED MORE FROM SOME ONE WITH PROXIMITY TO THIS ACT OF HEINOUS HOSTILITY. THESE TERRORRISTS AND THEIR FRIENDS MURDERED REAL PEOPLE. OUR PEOPLE. THIS MUSICAL DISIDERRATA HAS NOTHING REVEALING OR IMPORTANT ABOUT IT. IN AN ATTEMPT TO BE NON-JUDGEMENTAL THE BOSS BOWDLERIZES AN AUTHENTIC AND TRAGIC AMERICAN EXPERIENCE.
2,mediocre,"I was disappointed in the album overall. Bruce claims to have written the album rather quickly and I have to say that it shows. Many of the songs repeat, repeat, repeat chords and lyrics in a monotonous droning that I can only describe as filler. I found most, but not all, of the songs and lyrics uninspiring despite the subject matter. This would have made a better acoustic album and, in fact, what there is of piano and sax that are trademark E-street seem to blend into the background and lack the prominence and power that I have come to expect.There are two noteable exceptions that stand out on the album, either for the lyrics and emotion [Further On] or the classic style and power that Bruce is revered for [The Rising]. The album is worth a listen, but won't make it into my stack of favorites."
2,"Bruce, Where are You?","There comes a time when all artists must admit they no longer have the capacity to reach their audience and fans. Bruce, it seems to me with this album, has taken an irreversible step in that direction. Overall, the album lacks that inimitable Springsteen grit and covers the listener with glitz, which is not really Bruce. This has to be his poorest effort yet."
4,Really good songs overshadowed by themes,".Oh it is sooo good to hear Springsteen back, singing songs he cares about. When all the artifices of clever chords melt away, popular music has to boil down to sincerity, and this CD has tons of it. The melodies and arrangements are more interesting than I've heard from him in a LONG time - - if he weren't such an established artist you might refer to this as a ""breakout"" album. It's that distinctive.The PROBLEM (and I'm saying this as a New Yorker) is the Sep 11 thing. It doesn't need to be so strong in a record. It's not that I'm offended, or that it's because I lost friends - - it's just that the theme is SO unrelenting. It needs a break. Imagine a CD of oh you broke my heart and several variations. You'd get bored of that.Mr Boss, I want to send you hugs, but there's a lot more than Sep 11 going on."
3,Great Album....Just Not Great Springsteen,"No question this album is great--just does not compare favorably to the first 6 albums in my estimation. ""Jackson Cage"" off of ""The River"" would be one of the best songs on this album despite not being in the top 10 on its own album. But who can possibly expect Bruce to replicate that stunning run of genius early in his career? That being said, the album is filled with great hooks and some of the most beautiful ballads he has ever written. ""City of Ruins"", ""Nothingman"", ""Paradise"", ""Empty Sky"" are solid, top-line Springsteen songs, and ""Countin' on a Miracle,"" ""Lonesome Day,"" ""Into the Fire"", ""You're Missing"" also solid. Three stinkers: ""Worlds Away"" (which is some of the worst ... he's ever done, ""The Fuse"" (ditto) and ""Let's be Friends"" (nice hook, but I'd rather have ""The Angel""). Bottom Line: Better than anything else out there today but doesn't hold a candle to vintage Bruce. You'll love it once you can get over that...."
5,Rises above,"Having been a Springsteen fan since 1975 and seeing numerous concerts over the past 27 years, I found the Rising to be one of his best efforts, especially in recent years. I am a huge fan of the ""older stuff"", Darkeness on the Edge of Town, Wild, Innocent & E Street Shuffle, The River; you get the idea. This is up there with the best of them.After purchasing the CD, I dropped it in my magazine in my car and it hasn't left yet. It is on all of the time and my 6 year old daughter knows the words to several tunes and is wondering when I will be seeing him again (I can only hope!)Keep it up Bruce, I love ya!"
4,Bruce can stop chasing Dylan's shadow,"This album rates favourably with any the Boss has done, but it would have been even better if the producers had allowed the other E-Streeters to be more in evidence (note Clarence's sax fade on ""American Skin"", as a point of reference). ""You're Missing"" is almost too beautiful. All in all, Bruce can stop chasing Bob Dylan's or Woody Guthrie's shadows as a poet of modern America...he has matched the masters."
3,it's....ok...,"Bruce's new cd is 72 minutes with about 30 minutes of filler. it does have some great songs like the Rising and Lonesome Day, but overall many of the songs are very simplistic and repititious, especially the choruses. Into the Fire's chorus, obviously meant to be ""inspirational""...""may your faith give us faith, may your strength give us strength"" is just sappy and belongs on a Christian rock station. Max Weinberg's drums are high up in the mix so the tunes have the usual Boss fist-pumping feel, but a song like Waiting For a Sunny Day is just 87 era Mellencamp and not as good. Let's Be Friends and Mary's Place are strikingly repetitious with weak melodies and should've been left off, period. this is a feel good cd for people looking for a reason to believe after 9/11., but I think history will see The Rising for the mediocre offering that it is."
5,Rate it a 10 and get over it,"I wasn't aware that this CD had anything to do with 9/11 when I purchased it. My daughter brought it home from school and it just sounded great, so I bought my own copy. Admittedly, I have never been a die-hard fan of Springsteen's music (sorry). But, I have changed my mind based on this musical masterpiece. One cannot help being impressed with its depth of vitality and energy.That being said - this is one of the most amazing and enjoyable CD's I own. I love the variations in the tempos, the stories, the lyrics, and on and on. Great roadtrip music and several of the songs have been transferred to my walking tapes. This is one of those CD's that should be in everyone's collection."
3,"A strong album, ruined by over exposure and overproduction","For all of us springsteen fans upset with the ""sound"" of the album (i.e. the missing saxophone of Clarence, and the practically nonexistant Bittan on piano) just wait until the tour. I feel that what is missing on the album will come back to life through the E Street Band's live performance, a sad fact attributable to Brendan O'Brien's horrific overproduction of this album. How many times can we listen to songs with 10 second intros and then explosions of drum and guitar? I feel like every song on the Rising does just that.However, Bruce, in a lyrical sense is at top form... and only two songs on this album I can say are talking totally about September 11. So why was this album treated as though it were a ""Septemeber 11th"" album?All in all, I am not dissapointed, but I am also not overly impressed."
4,The Boss is back!,"Ritchie Sambora once said in response to the Bruce Springsteen CD ""Born In the USA"",""this is Bruce at his best, but then again, when's he not at his best."" ""The Rising"" is no exception. At the same time, he tries new and unique sounds like the violin parts. Not many rockers can pull off the bowed string instruments so splendedly. Bruce once said that this is dedicated to those whose families and incividuals who were killed in 9/11. Listening to these tracks, I can feel the sincerity toward his strong views. Bruce proves with ""The Rising"" that there will never be another artists as talented as him. By the way, I'm glad he brought back Steven Van Zant."
2,boring,"I just don't get the fascination with the boss. This has got to be the most over produced cd I've heard in ages; it's so heavy, the music is constantly attempting to breath but there's no open airwaves. Having said this, Bruce remains the best live act I've seen. Try Nebraska instead or another artist altogether. I'm confused."
3,The rising - review,"The first time I heard from Bruce Springsteens' new song ""the rising was last thursday in the english lesson. Our teacher let us hear the song and then she gaves us the text. For the first time I didn't like it, because I didn't understand the text, but after reading I like the song.First of all, I like that Bruce Springsteen wrote it from the perspective of a fireman who lost his life. I think you can feel with the man and perhaps you realize how terrible it was for all people who were at the World Trade Center.Another reason why I like this sing is the text with the melody- On the one hand the text is verdy sad but on the other hand it shows to the people who lost loved ones that thex shouldn't give up hope. The melody isn't sad and together with the text it's a good song.Last but not least I think the song is a good idea and perhaps it will give hope for some people who lost someone."
4,"The Boss yes, but classic Boss, no","I liked this album, but it is very different from Bruce's classic stuff. He seems to have abondoned a formula that was his own for something that is more mainstream and less like his classic style. These songs seemed forced into the same mass produced form that makes most modern music sound exactly alike, and in most cases, worthless and meaningless. I know this might sound cheesy, but his old music from albums like greetings from Asbury Park and Darkness on the edge of town were amazingly unique and even had a better sound (not to mention much deeper meaning and emotion) because they had Bruce's style all over them. The songs did not follow a redundant pop pattern and they were recognizably different. Overall, this album is pretty good, it has some good songs and catchy tunes, but i feel it is a bit forced and it certainly deviates from Bruce Springsteen's distinctive and creative writing style."
2,"Not his best, not by a long shot.","Poor Bruce Springsteen, getting old and moving sideways, wrapped-up in leftist political struggle, confused about life...sad, oh so very sad.His 'glory days' behind him, he pushed this one out. The music sounds forced, stale; like a poem without a theme or a rhyme; like a sunset on a clear night. Nothing fresh here, only confused notes and words. This one misses the boat (in my opinion, and after all, these reviews are only opinions).If you can relate to this CD, good for you. If you can connect to the music, good for you. But I know what's good and this isn't good at all.Bruce can do better; he's done oh so much way better!If you want real Springsteen; real hard, raw, innocent, righteous stuff, you gotta try the 'Tracks' 4-disc compilation. Now that's what music is!Thanks for reading this."
1,COME ON UP TO A 9/11!!!!!!,"What a rip off!!!I mean what a disgrace, to cash in on all those poor people who died.I mean is Meet me at Mary's place???What is that to do with 9/11?NOTHINGThat's what I sayYeah congrat's for the 2002 album of the year Grammy!!!!Ain't it gr8t to use a disaster, to cash in on a....DISASTEROUS ALBUM!!!!!!!Wow it won a Grammy...WHO CARES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The boss is back????WHO CARES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.SThe E stands for EXPERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not awful despite Springsteen's lack of musical talent,"Anyone who thinks Bruce Springsteen is talented must be tone death or must think 1st Grade Poetry is great. That said, ""The Rising"" is a thoughtful rock anthem that brings Bruce back to his glory days. ""Mary's Place"" is also decent. Unfortunately, this album smells like a desperate attempt to exploit all the 911 victims."
2,Mediocre effort followed by tired live performance,"Sadly, as a once loyal suppoter of the boss, I acknowledge that he simply doesn't have it anymore. The E street band has also grown either old or tired or both. I use to see BS at many of the small venues in New Jersey in his heyday. Great shows to be sure. In 2005, the last two shows at Shea stadium were a total disappointment. After starting two hours late, he gave the most lackluster performance to date. Clarence stood there like a rock and barely played. The rest of the band sounded week and loose. Almost as if they really didn't care. The boss was moving around a lot but vocally off key and strained to hit any of the tough notes. What a disappointment. If you're a BS fan, I know you hear it. If your not a fan, don't bother. His day is done. Buy the old records and rejoice in what was once a truly unique talent."
2,"Huge Hype, Limited Payoff","The sheer mediocrity of this album is astounding. First, Springsteen has completely lost the ability to sing. Gone are the fullness and vibrancy that once marked Springsteen's vocals. We are left instead with a sort of talk-singing that is compounded by a grating nasal affectation. Second, the music simply does not deliver. The album has a noodling, mid-tempo sameness that is only occasionally lifted (Further On, The Rising). The E Street Band might as well be the session players from Human Touch and Lucky Town. Third, while the album packs some degree of lyrical force, the media hype that has surrounded the lyrical content, which Springsteen seems to be feeding, borders on the exploitative. As a fan, I had held out hope . . . but I am sorely disappointed."
4,My Girl on The Moon Review,"Its ok, Mary's Place is one of the most annoying bruce songsever recorded. The Rising, Lonesome Day, Waiting on a Sunny Day,and Further On Up The Road are all my favorites on this. Thanksfor the review."
3,The Hardest Part is Letting Go,"I have no doubt that Springsteen will ultimately redeem his standing as one of the greats, just as Dylan has. But this effort, when viewed through the long lense of time, will come to be regarded in the same class as Lucky Town. There is some good new material here - I especially like Mary's Place, You're Missing and Lonesome Day - but much of the rest of the album is forced with some awefully trite lyrics. If you want to remind yourself of what the man is capable of, I strongly recommend the first two discs of the recent box set, Tracks.The hardest part of listening to each new effort from some of our old favorites is letting go of the past - artists reach their zenith and decline, just like all of us. Springsteen will rise again. We're just waiting for that sunny day."
2,Worst ever,"Being a fan from the 70's I know I am not going to be on anyone's good list after this, but here goes. This is the worst music put out by Bruce. I think the anticipation of a new E Street cd made people think it is better than it is. It is contrived, polished and sounds as though Bruce was having writer's block. He repeats himself too much and seems to think he is writing the music of the millenium. In future years, I believe people will look back and wonder what all the hype was about, just as they did with Milli Vanilli. I refused to see Bruce on tour due to not wanting to hear the worst drivel he has ever foisted on the public. To me, this is an offering to the almighty dollar, not to the American public as he proclaims. Bruce, Get back to your roots and leave the pr work to someone more suited to it."
2,Predictable,"Being a 20 plus year fan of Bruce Springsteen and The E-Street Band I could almost predict the next note that was to be played on each song. Bruce's words were rehashed from previous songs. The only one that was worth the cost of the CD was ""Counting on a Miracle"" because he allowed Little Steven sing harmony and you could almost hear him if you listened close enough. The remainder of the songs did nothing for me. I was greatly disappointed. Next time I'll just get out one of my old albums and pretend they are still that good."
3,I don't hate it.,"I was looking for just the right words to describe the sound of this cd, and one of the other reviewers here nailed it... it sounds like Mellancamp. At least some of it. Too much to ignore.And ""Nothing Man"" sounds too much like ""Streets of Philadelphia."" That was a little disconcerting.Not one of Bruce's best efforts, but it's hard to hate. I know that's not helpful. Let's just say this, ignore the hype. It's not all that."
3,Mixed Bag,"I feel like I want to like this record more than I actually do because it is a serious piece of work, authentic in the era of Britney Spears and has a couple of moments of greatness. Several listenable but mediocre cuts -- Waiting on a Sunny Day, Mary's Place -- two or three very good -- Lonesome Day, the Rising, World's Apart -- and one cut so extraordinary -- My City of Ruins -- that it ranks with the best songs Springsteen has ever written. Doesn't compare favorably to Born to Run or Darkness on the Edge of Town, but what ever could? I still need to try it my car. My guess is if you thought Born in the USA was great, you'll love this too."
2,no classics here,"I assume its pretty hard to write a whole album about an event such as 9/11. Im sure Bruce Springsteen's heart was in it, but the music is mediocre. No anthems, no raw sound his fans are used to, and the lyrics are pretty cliche. Sounds over produced. None of the instruments are really aloud to shine through. Some people will like it. After all, they are great musicians. I am a musician and am very open minded about all kinds of music; but I couldnt really find anything that grabbed me in this album. Its definately not the Boss we have heard in the past. And I don't think the Boss on this album comes close.One track stood out to me, ""paradise""."
3,"The Boss, yes, but classic Boss, no","I liked this album, but it is very different from Bruce's classic stuff. He seems to have abondoned a formula that was his own for something that is more mainstream and less like his classic style. These songs seemed forced into the same mass produced form that makes most modern music sound exactly alike, and in most cases, like worthless and meaningless [music]. I know this might sound cheesy, but his old music from albums like greetings from Asbury Park and Darkness on the edge of town were amazingly unique and even had a better sound (not to mention much deeper meaning and emotion) because they had Bruce's style all over them. The songs did not follow a redundant pop pattern and they were recognizably different. Overall, this album is pretty good, it has some good songs and catchy tunes, but i feel it is a bit forced and it certainly deviates from Bruce Springsteen's distinctive and creative writing style."
2,Pathetic moanings of a once mighty writer,"My wife and I were riding in the car, bored to tears by this album, and started changing the words. If you've listened to the rising, you know which tune the altered words fit into (Empty Sky). Springsteen is trying hard to sound profound on some tracks (Empty Sky), and trying hard to recapture the lost party days of youth on others (Mary's Place). Some tracks, such as Worlds Apart, sound ridiculous -- the multi-cultural thing doesn't work -- Bruce isn't Sting or Paul Simon, and it shows. There have been many raves about the album, but if anyone else's name was on the cover, I doubt it would get more than two stars and a ho-hum. Save your money and buy some of his older stuff, The Rising is lukewarm in places and sounds forced in others."
4,Don't Let Misguided Production....,"...spoil your enjoyment. Simply put, this album was meant to be played on a six-string. Listen and you'll see. All of the tunes have a ""Springsteen"" feel. There are well-crafted, moving lyrics joined with sweet, toe-tapping melodies. The knockabout syllables that characterize his early (late 70's/early 80's) work are still there. One can't help but imagine Bruce and his guitar laying these songs on the studio guys. I don't know why they didn't get it. These songs should have been released as as simple, unaccompanied tunes (so much for music industry executive imagination, maybe) but songs like ""Waitin' On A Sunny Day"" and ""You're Missing"" still sing pure and clean despite the excessive vocals and instrumentation. ""The River"" and ""Nebraska"" are wonderful narrative songs, and so are most of the songs on this album. They just don't know it yet. Look for a un-plugged or live version. Still an A+ collection, so don't be afraid."
5,The Boss is back!,"I never thought that I'd own a Bruce Springsteen album, but after watching his CBS concert special in February 2003, I just had to go out and buy this fantastic record. I was amazed by such songs as ""Into the Fire,"" ""Lonesome Day,"" ""Countin' on a Miracle,"" ""You're Missing,"" ""The Rising,"" ""Mary's Place"" and ""Waitin' on a Sunny Day."" After purchasing the album, I instantly fell in love with it. I must also say that I was captivated by The E Street Band. What a group of musicians!Bruce sings and writes with such passion and it shows brilliantly on ""The Rising,"" which should have been named album of the year at the recent Grammy Awards. It deserved it.Do not hesitate to buy this album. I know that I'll be buying more of Bruce's records if they're even half as good as ""The Rising."""
5,Incredible Range,"This is almost the perfect album. I bought this recently having listened to it years ago and it was like finding an old classical watch or something. It moved me. The hits are great of course- 'Sour Times' and 'Glory Box'. Songs like this just want you to run out and open a lounge with a blue light or something! Then there is the absolute gem in ""It's a Fire' with that wonderful bass running through as her voice weaves between the notes. This album is a beautiful moment in time."
5,Awesome till present day!,"I've heard so many of these songs prior to even looking at the song list on this CD. Yet, songs I've loved from 6 years ago, I'm still blown away by today....my current favorite is 'Roads'...."
4,i can't think of a good title for this review,"this cd is one of the ones i bought rather than having my friend burn for me. it was more or less worth the money i paid for it, with some REALLY good songs on it. very atmospheric, it really sets a mood. whatever mood it is is probably up to the listener, but......there are some songs i didn't like, however, mainly it's a fire and it could be sweet, and some other song i don't remember. when i bought the cd i was looking for something a little more dark and trippy and gloomy and eerie. it's a great cd anyway, the best and eeriest songs being biscuit and numb. strangers is a great funky trip-hop song. it's really cool to listen to this cd really loud with candles or something....just don't buy it expecting ALL the songs to be totally gloomy and ethereal.."
4,portishead-dummy mp3,"trippy beats, haunting choruses, this album is the epitome of portishead. Found biscuit,glory box and wandering star to be the best tracks by far, the others range from decent to filler."
2,Possesed and Distressed...,"Trippy and highly bizarre, only extremely open-mided listeners should apply here. This music will test both your patience and senses. The music is a shoe-in for ""B"" movie soundtrack stardom. Portishead is more music of the posssessed than the ""Trip-Hop"" hype associated with it."
4,liked it,"My favourite songs on this are 'Strangers' and 'Roads' and that other weird one with all the weird noises , I can't remember all the names, i just know what they sound like! I love the deep, scratchy bass, that heavy feeling, I LOVE that... Dummy is definitely better than the live album."
4,No pretense. Just...,"I agree with less pretentious critics of this album, if you are looking for a more musically complex sound try Massive Attack, Morcheeba, or The Mars Volta.But I don't put it in the player for complexity. To me it strips away the foreplay of the ""trip-hop"" label, and reduces the moment to something simple and carnal. Beth Gibbons voice in ""Glory Box"" drips sex like a jilted, loved-starved Venus."
4,Such a trip!,"This album carries this deep vague element where you don't know and you don't bother yourself to know,you just sit there,listen and feel the music's cross over,it has this modern gothic sense,at times it's sensual and at times it's disturbing,and that's the secret of this album,in a way it portrays women's emotions through the beats and lyrics. It's more of the subconscious mind kicking in than the conscious mind. It's a slick album that awakens the senses,you don't skip the tracks,you simply let it play,you don't know which one or what kind or where from,like i said,you just listen..."
4,Pleasantly Tranquil,"Although this genre of music will not sell well at radio stations and party functions, trip-hop definitely stands out when one wants a relaxing, reflecting time on one's own. The music have a sleep-inducing feel, and at the same time showing off quality musicianship and wonderful vocals.The solo vocalist in ""Dummy"" maintains a dreamy,angelic voice throughout, focusing on the tone of the music rather than the melody. You will find that the techno beats somewhat overused, but nevertheless still effective.There are no real standout tracks, but ""It could be sweet"" and ""Glory box"" tend to sound more unique and welcomingly energetic in comparison to the other lazy, lethargic and often trantic tracks.If you're looking for a fresh new genre of music away from the pop, hip-hop and rock scene, then I recommend trip-hop, and ""dummy"" is among the top trip-hop albums in the scene."
5,"""Dummy"" is one of the greatest albums to date.","I really like this album, as well as their second album. The idiot below me thinks that track 6 ""It's a Fire"" is weak, but actually, it's one of the best Portishead songs that there are. ""Biscuit"" is strange and slightly eerie and I really like ""It Could Be Sweet"" - mainly because of the cool drum riff that they do on the drum machine. ""Portishead"" (the album) is also excellent. Pick it up if you can. I still cannot believe that someone thought that TRACK 6 was WEAK! Most Portishead fans LOVE that song. Listen to it up above. It is a great song."
5,Freaky moody mix that's not all noise...,"Portishead manages to sucessfully blend together dark, moody music with the soultry vocals of Beth Gibbons. The foundation for many of the musical tracks come from old 60's films that are blended together with modern synthesizer and keyboard sounds. These musical tracks are accentuated by Beth Gibbons's vocals which play off the unique sound created by Geoff Barrow, the resident mixer. I'm sure any person ready for a new sound that isn't immersed in oddness will be pleased with This Portishead CD."
5,Beth!!!,"It's greatful!!! One of the greatest trip-hop albums of all times!!! And this is REAL TRIP-HOP!!! Beth is very charizmic, like always))). Sound quality is super - first press is always cool!!!))) Thank You Amazon for this diamond!!!"
3,Relevant But Not a Classic,"Hailed as one of the key trip-hop albums, Portishead`s debut is an interesting and gripping effort but as a whole it`s not really a standout or a masterpiece. It wisely creates a dark, unsettling and haunting atmosphere, and in some moments it truly becomes hypnotically nightmarish. In that regard, it`s an effective piece of music, offering captivating moods and ambiances. However, as a whole it`s a way too depressing listening experience and its sound isn`t as ecclectic as it should. Beth Gibbons` vocals are impressive and adequate to the overall nocturnal, film-noirish feel, even if she sounds a bit melodramatic at parts. There are a couple of great songs here, though, ""Mysterons"", ""Strangers"" and ""Roads"" being the highlights.A worthwile achievement, yet not as dazzling as some claim."
4,Music for Depressed Lovers,"If this album doesn't remind you of darkness in your past, you're too young to operate a stereo. Each song comes from the place in the heart that gets eaten by despair, as it cries and cries to no avail. Lovely, though."
3,Still Good After All These Years,"My brother hipped me to this CD a long time ago. He was listening to it and I wanted to know who it was. He told me, so I went out and got it. I liked it then and while listening to it a few nights ago, I remembered how much I still like it. I can't even describe what kind of music this is and how wonderfully strange the lead singer's voice is. Heck, I still don't know anything about Portishead except for the fact that I really like this CD and Glory Box is my favorite song here. I call it the cheeba-smoking music."
2,Not an essential,"There is nothing on this album that mope-rock groups like The Cure didn't do a heck of a lot better. Though the music is intentionally dark and disturbing, lead singer Beth Gibbons caterwauling renders most songs uninteresting at best and unlistenable at worst. ""Sour Times,"" the hit single, is an apt description of how listeners will feel after playing this disc. This album does not belong on Amazon's otherwise fine list of Alternative Essentials."
2,"Repetition, Repetition, Repetition","This album is a bore(does the title refer to the purchaser? I think so!). I'm sorry to see people praising an unimpressive effort like this one...why not demand some musical complexity? Too many musicians and groups like this one make their living off of the media's false praises. Forget trends...just make music that is real and compelling, not dull. The media doesn't matter, the music does!"
2,This album is awesome.......if you're suicidal!!!,"I can't stop laughing at the reviews that condemn this album, because they're so darn precise to me. As I recall, one reviewer wrote, and I quote:""After giving this album a few listens, I'm gonna sale this piece of junk"". Had me laughing to tears for about 10 minutes. You've hit the spot, boy! However, I also laugh at all the reviewers who praise this album, for I feel pity for them. Just a bunch of trend followers who can't tell the difference between good music and, um, trends.Of course there are a couple of good songs, literally speaking, referring to ""Roads"" and ""Glory Box"", the reasons why this album got 2 stars instead of one. But as a music fan with an open mind, I've heard much better than this, such as Soulstice's ""Illusion"" just to name a solid example. As an advice to all you people reading this, don't be a dummy: download this before buying, like I did. Then you decide. Good Luck..."
2,"Updated review: 4-5 stars, A GREAT ALBUM","Give this record a chance and you'll love it. Guess I jumped the gun or my subwoofer wasn't tuned properly or something--sorry!Original review:The singer is lame and every song sounds like it was made with a drum kit that is mixed way (as in too much) out front. In a few words -- boring and dated. There just isn't that much really good pop out there so people have to make a fuss about what they know, I guess. Skip this CD and try something like 'When it Falls' from Zero 7."
5,Quite Possibly the Greatest Trip-Hop Ever,"Portishead has always been a big favorite of mine, and this CD might just top the charts. I still can't decide which one is better, the original self-titled album, or Dummy. Both blend AMAZING vocals with a strong beat and gorgeous melody. I've already worn out the first CD from constant play, and I fear this one's next. The music STILL affects me after three years of listening. A definate must-but for fans of Trip-hop, Ambient, and any sort of Electronica."
4,It's a trip.,"It looks like it's all been said about this album by now. Few would argue that ""Dummy"" is the essential Portishead disc, and possibly the epitome of the genre. Smooth, creepy, sexy, and hypnotic. It definitely sets a mood. The production and beats are a perfect match to Beth's vocals. If there was a hit here it would be ""Sour Times"", but the entire disc holds up to that track, and some are much better I think. This album seems to have no equal, and if it did I suppose it would be Massive Attack's ""Mezzanine"". Just opinion of course. If you suspect you might like this, you won't. You'll love it."
5,A mysterious and moody masterpiece,"There's something about this Cd that only compelles me to play this only when it's cloudy or rainy outside. From the first track Mysterious sets the mood for this album. dark, moody intricate. During the first listen it mau sound like it's simple trip hop music but when you listen to it again you begin to hear that there's so much more. The beats are hip hop breakbeats accentuated by live instruments, distorted scratching, weird samples and haunting vocals from Beth Gibbons. The result is a murky, multi layered masterpiece that stretches the musical boxes used to classify music. My favorite cut on Dummy is the spaghetti western flavored sour times but my other faves are Mystyerious, numb and Glory Box."
5,"The ""trip hop"" era's true masterpiece.","Though most call Tricky's first album Maxinquaye the trip hop era's zenith, I feel it was more fully realized on Dummy.The album flows so well, and the styles here go together so well. The album literally sounds like the soundtrack to an old spy film. The spooky and beautiful atmospherics are great for those cold, lonely nights of winter when you can't be close to the one you love.Beth Gibbons' vocals might be a bit of an aquired taste, but fits perfectly in with the music. Her voice doesnt' overpower the music, and the music never overpowers her voice.An interesting tidbit, the chorus of Wandering Stars is actually that of a Bible verse. Which one, I've no clue. But it's true, I checked on this when a friend claimed it to me.I just hope the next album is on it's way. The 1997 follow-up was a bit disappointing, but I'm still wanting to hear what will come next."
5,You've got to want to find...,"... want to find away, to purchase this album.In the 6 years since it's release, DUMMY has gained a place as a creation of modern musical genius.The prodigal Geoff Barrow, accompanied by the tortured voice of Beth Gibbons, delivers the darkest - yet most simplistic - mood to be experienced in the world of popular music.The perfect lyrics of ""SOUR TIMES"", ""WANDERING STAR"", AND ""ROADS"" seem to call upon a purity that we all know is impossible to gain, yet we strive for on a personal basis.Maybe it's a bit strange to think of a soundtrack for the abyss between heaven and hell - but if you were to called to, DUMMY would be a front runner.Listen to it when your happy, sad, ill, ecstatic. It'll strike you every time."
5,Phenomenal,"Portishead 'Dummy' is one of the best albums I've heard. The music strokes the senses, sends chills down the spine... soothing and exciting the inner self. An album in a class/genre by itself."
5,One of the decade's best. Easily.,"Anyone who gives this album less than a four star rating obviously does not know how to listen to music. Sure, on first, second, and even third listen the album sounds tragically depressing and far from pleasing to the ear. All truly great albums shock and/or confuse the listener. What sets apart the true music fan from a mere mainstream, pop-culture follower is how closely he listens to an album, not judging soley on a first impression. And those who know and love music understand how breathtakingly original ""Dummy"" is. Sparse yet full of intricacies, Portishead created one of the decade's most enduring and mind-expanding albums in 1994, years before the other ""media-whoring"" so-called ""trip-hop"" acts. Portishead and ""Dummy"" is the real thing."
5,"Music that moves, touches and holds","Someone once asked me to describe what kind of music Portishead'does, and I failed. I find them very original, and very, very moving. It's hard to describe what I feel when listening to them, but I can sure tell you it's alot. They make music that moves, touches and holds you. But it is an ecuierd taste, so listen to it before you buy it; there's a chance you hate it. But I surely don't, I just love it!!"
3,give sample tracks a good listen first!,"I agree with everything written here by Portishead fans about the instrumentals, but I found the singer's high pitched voice both highly annoying and inexpressive. I find myself wanting to listen to this CD, but always taking it off again about halfway through, when the voice gets even shriller, the lyrics more and more repetitive. I would recommend that people listen hard to the Amazon sound bites before deciding to buy."
3,Its ok.. but not that great..,"I purchased the disc thinking it was gunna be a reat add to my collection... eh..... The only real songs I like are ""El telefono"" & ""la Cama""... but other then that.. I think its okay... but maybe a little too much hype. Also to this is ther first Hector El Father cd I own, And was kinda dissapointed..."
3,But Its Hector EL Father!!!!!!!!!!!,The only reason to get this album is to add it to your Hector EL Father collection it clearly demonstrates that Jay Z and his then camp the ROC had NO business getting envolved on this album...they are clueless to Reggaeton...but Hector pulls through on this cause he knows his sound and his art form.Like I said its a collection cd after all it is EL Father thats why i bought it all the tracks with out the interference of the 'hip hop team' are splendid.
3,IT'S OKAY...,"This album is ok. but REGGAETON dosen't need ""roc a fella"" or ""Def Jam"" and yeah keep reggaeton Spanish besides that Its a AIGHT album but its missing the most important ingredient and that's ""TITO EL BAMBINO"" I didnt like the fact that JAY Z was on one of the songs ya know since when does Jay Z care about REGGAETON??? maybe Its all about the MONEY...JUDEGE for Yourself ""PEACE"""
1,missing,"We never received the CD. I wish I could say I love it, but I can't and it was supposed to be a gift for my mother for mother's day. I have sent a few emails regarding the missing item, but no response yet. I checked the tracking and says it was delivered april 20th or so, but we never got it. I was charged for the item.I hope this resolves the problem and we receive a replacement for the missing CD promptly.Thank you."
4,"Not your typical ""coming out"" novel","I found this book to be a very pleasant surprise. I read ""Tokyo Vanilla"" straight through on a long business flight and was very sorry to see it end (although I did find the ending a bit of a letdown). It is the story of a Japanese college student who gradually realizes his sexual orientation and falls in unrequited love with a handsome Japanese heartbreaker. The plot takes many twists and turns, some of which I found a bit implausible, but overall I enjoyed the ride. According to the cover notes, Thomas Boggs is ""an American Japanese writer who has spent most of his life in Japan's capital."" I cannot speak to the accuracy of Mr. Boggs' description of Tokyo's gay world, but I have definitely placed it on my list of future vacation destinations. I must agree with other reviewers on the title, though - I haven't a clue what ""Tokyo Vanilla"" means"
2,Totally uninspiring,"Only good tracks here - Daddy Get That Cash and I Get High, there have no standouts lyrics, but the hooks are really tight. All cd is about how gangsta Styles is. He has no flow, his lyrics are really weak, he has noting imteresing to say. He just spitting all this gangsta s**** that is flyin' all around.C class rapper, period."
4,DBLOCK WHATUP!!!,"HE GOTTA BE ONE OF MY FAV. RAPPERS WHO KEEPS IT REAL 24/7 AND FOR HIS DEBUT ALBUM I WAS AMAZED. A GANGSTER AND A GENTLMAN IS ONE OF THE REALEST ALBUMS OUT. S.P ALSO FEATURES MY OTHA DBLOKC VETERANS JADAKISS, J-HOOD, AND SHEEK LOUCH. NOW IM WAITIN ON HIS NEXT ALBUM TIME IS MONEY...IM FINNA COP IT THE DAY IT COMES OUT. I KINDA LIKE DBLOCK MORE THEN I LIKE DIPSET. ITS ALL HIP HOP ANYWAYS."
3,Not bad for a solo,"The first two songs ""Good Times"" b/k/a ""I get high"" and ""the life""were impressive singles. As a result, I bought the album expecting Styles to hit hard. Some of the songs were mediocre, but for the most part Styles came wit it."
3,SHOULD OF BEEN BETTER,GOOD TIMES=10/10Y'ALL KNOW WE IN HERE=10/10TITLE TRACK=8/10BLACK MAGIC=7/10DADDY GET THAT CASH=8/10LICK SHOTS=6/10AND I CAME TO...=8/10GET PAID=10/10I'M A RUFF RYDER=5/10SOUL CLAP=8/10WE THUGS=8/10STYLES=6/10LISTEN=6/10Y'ALL DON'T WANNA...10/10NOBODY BELIEVES ME=8/10MY BROTHER=4/10THE LIFE=7/10
1,Plays on CPU but not any CD Player I've tried: Scratches,"Album is dope, but I give the PURCHASE/Vendor low score because it's unplayable in any CD player except my CPU. Album is a definate 4 stars tho."
4,Solid Debut,"This was a solid debut, Styles really holds it down. But 24 tracks? Too long. I really want the Lox to release another album, its been 3 years since ""We Are The Streets"". Their a great group. Styles holds it down with some good lyrics and excellent beats. It's hard rap music, so don't go looking for some quiet stuff on here. I liked this album, although it is too long, gangsta rap fans and Ruff Ryders fans should pick it up.My favorite tracks were ""Good Times"", ""Y'all Know We In Here"", ""Daddy Get That Cash"", ""Lick Shots"", ""I'm A Ruff Ryder"", and ""Life"". There are a lot of other good songs but these were my favorites."
5,GANGSTA!!!,"I think this is one of the best debuts besides DMX, that the Ruff Ryders has ever done. I was always a big LOX fan and also a huge Styles fan. I know Styles i a real gangsta that spits only for the streets and the gutter. Respect styles...hold it up!"
3,I Would've given it a 3.5 but I can't,"This Is a great album Except it starts to crumble towards the ending Styles is one the best Lyricist as he shows in ""Ya'll Know we In Here"". Everything is good except the production starts to crumble at the ending. The guest apperances in this album are nice, it has The Lox and the young upincoming Jae Hood, and Angie Stone brings some soul to the song ""Black Magic"". This is probably the best album of 2002. But this album will not appeal to you if you like all that commercial rap."
3,I'm a little disappointed,"Styles has long been my favorite member of the Lox. He doesn't get as much publicity as Jadakiss, but I feel he brings more to the table lyrically. So when I heard the blazing track, ""Good Times"", I rushed out and bought this album. I must say that I think he is capable of a much better album than this. There just aren't that many great tracks. The album is full of so-so tracks that just leave me wanting better. I hope his next album is better, he can definitely make a classic. The bright spots are, ""My Life"", ""Gangster and a Gentleman"", ""Good Times"", and ""We Thugs""."
4,4 mics/XL outta XXL/4 Nutts...Double R iz at it AGAIN!!!,An impressive single 'I Get High' & a cool 'Life' az a bonus makes u wanna cop it. Tha best street banger iz wit MOP called 'Yall Dont Wanna.' Overall its just REALLY tight expect fo some of the beats sound corny ta me but 4 da hardcore fanz ya gotta cop it! also check out E-40 nu ish. 1 luv playa & peace out.
3,This CD could be so much better,"Styles P really packed this CD with pretty good songs. I'd say that there is about 50.Minutes of very good music! Standouts are ""The Life"", ""My Brother"", ""Nobody Believes Me"", ""We Thugs"", ""Listen"" and ""I'm A RuffRyder"". Still, endlessly long skits and weak songs, such as ""And I Came To..."", ""Get Paid"", ""Lick Shots"" and ""Yall Don't Wanna ...."" put this cd 2 stars down in my rating. Still, Styles shines on most of the songs."
4,Works as designed,"The meter works as it is advertised and seems to be accurate enough for most applications. One feature it does not have that would be useful would be a backlight on the display screen. In low light conditions it is hard to read the display; using a light to see the screen changes the reading. Other than that, it is light and rugged and easy to carry in the field."
4,Beautifully Crafted!,"This is a beautifully crafted novel which addresses many issues including racial tensions, friendship, loss, and incest, but I think it could have been even better if it had been longer and more fully developed. I found myself wanting more than the novel delivered, but it was still beautifully crafted, and now I look forward to reading more of Ms. Woodson's work."
5,Very good Book,"I have read this book 2 times now.It is a very good book,in the story theres this black girl named Marie and a WhiteGirl called Lena moves in,they call Lena 'whitetrash'.These two girls Marie and lena become friends but lena has a terrible secret,Marie dosent know what to do,Should she tell?Yet the two girls learn the value of freindship,and something that is true is,keep it in your mind,""Why cant we all be people here?'People like always"
2,I hadn't meant to tell you this.,"This book was ok. It shows how two girls from a different classe and race can become great friends.The two main characters are Marie and Lena. They become great friends and help each other through their problems. This book shows how kids can get hurt by their parents. Lena experience this when her father hurts her deeply.Both of their mother left them. Lena mother died of breast cancer, and Marie mother walk out on her leaving Marie with her father.These are just some of problems these girls face in the book. This is a good book to read."
4,"A great book, full of emotions and real-life drama, read it!","This book is a great book. Ms. Woodson made a great decisions in choosing the main character the age of the readers. It helps us teens understand the story and relate to it. This book has many morals, and do's/don't's. I recommend it to anyone who likes emotional stories. Again, filled with deep eomtions and you can fell the pain and/or happiness of the characters. It's very realistic and identical to every-day experiences. This helps readers learn about various life-styles and how they can relate. A definite 4 out of 5 stars!! I enjoyed it a lot!"
4,No,"I think this book is pretty involved and 4th graders wouldn't really understand it. I hate the fact that everyone's saying that they shouldn't have run away; Marie should've told someone. I mean, although that would be the smarter choice, these are kids and in real life that's what many kids do. I think this book should've taken place in some other place because you can guess that in Ohio there are more white people than black. I think this book covered the issue of racism well, but Woodson could've spoken more about the kid's feelings and other alternatives Lena might've considered..."
3,Truth hurts,The books is set in Ohio about two girls one white(Lena) one black(Marie). The tables have change in which the black girl is the one who is well off and the white girl is very poor. The book is written from Marie's view. She met her through school where the first day she sat next to her. Both girls soon realize they have a lot in common both their mothers are no longer around. Marie's mother abandoned her and her dad and Lena's mother died of cancer. The book deals with a very sensitive subject about sexual abuse which Lena's dad does to her. The abuse though is slightly touched upon.I believe the author really touched the heart with this book it was very sad but yet it's stuff that happens every day highly recommend great for book discussion for children pertaining to race relation and possible an introducion to knowing about abuse.
3,It was ok.....,"I liked the book and everything, but I as expecting a little more. It didn't really tell you anything. You'd want to know exactly how Lena and Marie must've felt, but it didn't really tell you in much detail. It did have a lot of questions that annoyed me as well because it didn't seem ""real"". You'll know what I mean when you read it. There are other books out there that'll tell you a lot more idea and feeling, so I only rated it 3 stars."
5,Wow. This is a real eye-opener to the real world!!,I read this book three times in one day. It touched my heart so deeply that I began to feel the pain of losing a parent. I absolutely loved this book. It just shows how judgement of character is not about looks.
2,to short,"not as bad as some books, but bad all the same. It would make a good book, if it took up about anouther 200 pages. it might be becouse i read alot, but this book was to short to be worth reading"
5,"Wonderful, You go girl!","This album is wonderful. With great songs like ""Sunny Came Home"" and ""You And The Mona Lisa."" Shawn's vocals and lyrics makes it a wonderful album. Since 1989, Shawn has been going strong. Shawn is a gifted songwriter and a wonderful gutair player too!"
2,I only liked the first song.,"If someone out there wants to buy this CD because of the very first song (""Sunny came home""), don't buy it. I ended up making that mistake. The rest of the CD is rather boring.Thanks."
3,A few steps shy of greatness,"It's not easy building on a huge breakthrough hit, but in all fairness, Shawn Colvin does her darndest. The problem is the same one a lot of up-and-coming singers have, nothing that makes her really stick out. Sarina Paris had a beautiful voice (and plenty of vocoder help), Madonna had...well, everything. Colvin? A willingness to try something different, and, er, regional appeal. And that ""grrl"" mystique. Okay, but not enough to break through to stardom.Nonetheless, she's quite good at what she does, which is enjoyable, listenable folk with just a bit of an edge. If you already have a lot of favorite albums, this is a nice addition.Favorite tracks: The Facts About Jimmy, I Want It Back, Wichita Skyline, Get Out of This House, and of course, Sunny Came Home."
5,Saw this woman live in concert,"""Sunny Came Home"" tells a profound story of a woman who ""didn't believe in transcendence."" It might be easy to dismiss Shawn Colvin as just another angry grrrl alternative rocker/folk singer. Don't. Her love letter to Kansas (she's from North Dakota and loves the move ""Fargo"" for putting it back on the map), Wichita Skyline, elevates, not quite ""Over the Rainbow"" Judy Garland style (no one will ever be Judy Garland), but creates a range for this talented performer who took the stage one night in Detroit, Michigan, wearing overalls and looking as well as sounding beautiful. The kind of person you could see as your best friend...but don't cross her! Just kidding."
4,Joined at the Hip?,"This is not meant aa a knock, so just back off right now, you negginators (yeah, you know who you are!), but does it strike anyone else out there in Amland how strong a resemblence there is betweem Suzie Vega and Shawn? It's not just the fact that their names begin with the same letter. I'd swear they were congenital twins (maybe like Arnie and Danny Devito, sure..) judging from the sound of their songs, the type of lyrics they write (edgy neo romantic, goth tinged) and the sound coming out of their respective backup bands. I'm not gonna do the research on this (will leave it to the true believers to correct me), but they sound like the exact same guys! This is getting scary! Put this CD on, then listen to a Suzanne Vega CD right after it (The Soundtrack to Magnolia will do just fine) then email me and tell me I'm full of it! I'm full of a lot of stuff, but I've done some genius detective work here, so cut me maybe 3'4 inches worth of slack, willya?BEK"
2,OK-- But I Don't Get It!,"Pretty good... but I just don't get ""Sunny Came Home..."" What is the song supposed to be about?I prefer my songs more straight-forward, like ""Burning Down the House"" by Talking Heads, and ""I Just Called To Say I Love You"" by Stevie Wonder."
1,A checklist of cliches,"""I close my eyesI'm hypnotizedI'm walking on a wire? . . . into the fire?!?""Possibly the most trite song ever recorded . . . 'nuff said."
5,Fantastic,"I purchased this on cassette after seeing Ms. Colvin perform on television. I was impressed by her lyrics, voice, emotion and smile. I have come to love this collection of songs. They are relaxing, to me, and offer relief - hearing someone so clearly and eloquently speak of pain that I have known. She does not seek pity, but rather deals with the subjects honestly and factually, as they are facts of one's life that cannot be changed. I love Ms. Colvin's emotion, turn of a phrase, music and sheer genius ability to convey such raw, human, often-hidden feelings in such an honest and appropriate way. I also liked the way she showed respect for all angles of the subjects she addressed. This is a gem. A friend was taking a life changing path and I gave her this to listen to as she drove cross country. I miss it so much. I have to get another cassette of this wonderfully human collection of music by a lovely lady."
4,A Beautiful Listening Experience,"This CD is wonderful. ""Trouble"" is, by far, the best song on the disc - it's sexy and haunting. ""If I Were Brave"" is a close second in loveliness. Shawn has an angel's voice and a poet's heart. If you like folky women singer types, this is right up your alley. I think that this CD and ""Cover Girl"" are her best."
4,A solid ablum,"Shawn Colvin made a great album with ""A Few Small Repairs"". All in all, it's a very honest album that touches the soul and the heart. With ""Sunny Came Home"", Colvin hit the big time and won a grammy. But it's the guts of the album that really make it special. ""The Facts About Jimmy"" talks about colvins long time drinking problem with passion and warmth. She plays with words on this album better then most artist creating her own unique sound that is very consistent to the lyrics that flow from her mouth. This is the type of album that you can put on from begining to end and sit back and relax. A must, but probably the only Colvin album to buy."
3,An OK attempt at some decent music.,"""A Few Small Repairs"" is a good album. I bought it for ""Sunny Came Home"" as did most other people I'm sure. Some of the songs are good, others, not. I need to listen to it more to really feel the album."
5,This Author is an Expert,"After I purchased this book I contacted the author, Mr. Moore to ask him about collecting autographs by index cards or by photographs. He was prompt and very informative with his reply. If you want questions answered about auotgraph collecting, get in touch with him, you will be happy you did."
4,Comprehensive Review,This is a very comprehensive review that left nothing out. Recommend this book as a very valuable reference tool to every professional.
4,Survival of the Fittest,"What a relief to sit comfortably ensconsed in a different century! The author points out the cruelty of everyday life under the reign of Queen Victoria and the futility of the struggle to survive. It should be a lesson to all of us nowadays when we complain about the tough life we have to endure.We have come a long way! While the narration certainly is very interesting, it also seems curiously flat and without a lively soul. Maybe that stems from the fact that much of the book has a few sources only and just seems to copy them. Also, the back and forth of the time frame makes it somewhat incoherent. It would have helped a great deal to include a few maps of London."
3,The Lighter Side Of A Musical Chameleon,"The chameleonic Bruce Cockburn has more muscial sides than one could ever imagine. Here in his self-titled debut album/CD, 'Bruce Cockburn' we are introduced to the lighter side of this musical genius.Nothing complicated here, just Bruce and his guitar having a good time. Containing -10 tracks-, the tunes are simple and folksy like a gentle breeze on a hot summers day. At times carefree, at times contemplative, but all enjoyable. Perfect for daydreaming the afternoon away.A beautiful first album and the humble beginning of a fruitful career for this Canadian legend. To understand where a person's going you have to know where they've been."
4,A solid album,Sold effort by a man who would in his future be one of the greatest guitar players to walk the earth. If you are unfamiliar with his work buy this album after purchasing his later stuff. If you have any of his later work purchase this one to complete your collection so you can see more of his evolution.
4,A nice debut,"There is no question that this is a first album, especially for Cockburn, as none of the anger and seriousness that would show up in his later (and more recent) work was here yet. That said, these songs are light and breezy, gentle folk songs that make for pleasant listening on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Bruce was off to a good start, but he got a lot better very quickly..."
2,You pay your money and you take your chance,"For completists only. Bruce's unremarkable debut gives little hint of the wonders to come. If you have the rest, then by all means you will enjoy hearing where it all began. But there's tremendous growth even to the next album, High Winds White Sky. You can get all the highlights from this one on the double-CD version of Waiting for a Miracle."
5,Excelsior!,It's actually a little brighter than shown on the picture but it's still a great flag. Great way to represent your state (if you're from NY).
2,The Book Is Not What I Thought It Was,"I feel guilty giving Josh Lewin's book a rating of only two stars, but I should have looked more carefully before I bought the book. I am a big Josh Lewin fan, and was disappointed when he left telecasting the Tigers with Kirk Gibson to join the Texas Rangers. I grabbed the book as soon as I saw his name as the author, and I thought I was going to read about Josh's baseball experiences and the making of trades during baseball's winter meetings. Instead, the book is about minor league teams auditioning audio tapes of prospective announcers looking for a minor league job at baseball's winter meetings in Nashville. Some information is also provided regarding team mascots. Had I looked at the book's contents before I bought it, I would have put it back on the shelf. My rating of two stars is based on my interest level, not on the book's quality. If you write another one on your baseball experiences, Josh, I will be sure to buy it, because I enjoy your work."
5,TOO EASY FOR WORDS,"This was the second cookbook I bought after starting on my new weight loss plan. It is great. The ""pretend"" macaroni and cheese recipe, actually made with cauliflower has blown everyone's skirt up. It is so good. Then there's the ""pretend"" mashed potatoes. I could go on and on, but everyone just needs to go buy the book and see for themselves. I LOVE IT"
3,Overuse of artificial sweeteners,I was greatly disappointed to see sugar-free desserts loaded with artificial sweeteners. There are many creative ways to have desserts without using chemicals of highly controversial value.
5,My favorite cookbook,"First I want to say that I am not a diabetic, so I have no idea if this book is useful for that purpose. I am a young mom who is trying to eat sugar-free without counting carbs or points, and I want some easy recipes that we will be excited about for supper. I have been using this cookbook for over six months, and it is absolutely the best thing that ever happened in my kitchen! Of course there are a few recipes that we have tried and do not like -- I just cross them out! But I would say that 90% of the recipes that I try are easy and taste delicious. These recipes use ingredients that I have heard of, the procedures are explained in everyday language, and they end up tasting great. We are eating more variety now and trying new things on a regular basis. I also bought Mrs. Bahan's Sugarfree New Orleans, and we like it just as well. We're just hoping that she eventually puts out another cookbook!!"
5,Hunter X Hunter,"This Anime series, written by the creator of Yu Yu Hakusho, is an excellent tale full of puzzles and fun.As the fourth boxed set, many are saying that this is the last part of the series, which is not quite true. It finishes a major portion of the story, but it is then continued in three OVAs which will hopefully be brought to DVD as boxed sets themselves. This set finishes the war between the 10 Godfathers and the Spiders in a very dramatic way, but it does not end Gon's journey by far. Anyone who loves this series, I recommend reading the Manga and trying to find the OVAs. They are well worth watching."
5,just like i remembered,i had watched this show along time ago and wanted to see it again. some of the endings change but it is still a good anime
5,hunter series is a great show,"all the seasons of hunter should be released onto dvd,I know you can get them from tv addicts but they are not the original studio dvds but if people want them they will go to any lengths to get them"
4,I liked it!,"This nasty princess isnt who everybody thinks she should be, neither is the sweet, well mannered dragon! They trade places and have ball. It teaches that you can be yourself and be happy, also gives some insight into others views. You dont have to be perfect or how others want you to be.. There are perks to being kind and polite though. My kids decided it would be a better choice to be a friend."
3,A lesson in manners.,A simple story of reversing roles between a princess and a dragon.The princess in this story is rude and the dragon is sweet and friendly. Interesting and funny comments from the charcters as they go about living. Lesson learned? Just be yourself.
4,"Gimme something to hold onto, these boys are good!","With the energy of a pack of sugar fed hyperactive 4 year olds, the combined swagger of Jimi Hendrix and the Brat Pack, Hagfish truely do rock Your Lame Ass. I picked up this classic of the Texas scene because I really liked the single Stamp, which received decent airplay on my local alternative radio station back in 1995. I figured since the band was unheard of aside from that one song that the album would be a one good track kind of thing. Was I wrong! Stamp, for all of its pubescent charm (what 18 year old boy wouldn't like a song with a hook like ""we eat my box while I work"")Stamp is not even the best song on this record. It is equaled or surpassed by tracks like Happiness, Bullet, Flat and Minit Maid. If you dig punk-lite/power pop bands, this record is a must have. To the best of my knowledge, it is their best work to date."
4,$29.99 and no ironing,This wasn't my first choice but it is a very user friendly polyester cotton blend.
3,Touching.,"Touching and heart-tugging. Certainly an emotional pull. But I must say, I greatly prefer another book of the genre, ""Daughters of Hope: Stories of Witness and Courage."" It not only covers women from far more countries, but it goes beyond the emotional pull. It gives clear prayer and activity responses, country by country, giving guidance as to what we can do. I don't want to know unless I also know how to respond."
2,"Seems well built, but has function issues","This pump was a letdown. That is a shame because it appears to be quite solid and well built. The air gauge high on the pump made it nice to read. The only problem I encountered, and it was a deal breaker, was the head would not consistently make a good seal on either Presta or Schrader valves. I am convinced that they have not really developed a head that is capable of fitting both types of valves and I don't care for the delicate nature of the dual head models. I returned this pump because it simply was not usable with this head. I intend to purchase a quality pump exclusively made for Presta valves - probably a Lezyne or Silca. I will use my old one for the rare times I need to fill a Schrader valve."
5,as good as it gets...,"I enjoy Scarlatti...have 2 complete sets of the music and have played his works on the piano (sorry!).But this is harpsichord. There are a lot of recordings, some very good of Scarlatti's music. I own a good portion of them including Scott Ross's traversal of the complete works. None is better than this disc. I'm amazed both at the quality of the playing and especially the recording quality. This is a great harpsichord. There's more color and the music dances, bounces, beguiles.... The notes are generous - but I wish I could tell you more. This is volume 1, but of what?? It is recorded on a label called Mirare. Who?? I bought the disc because I've been impressed with Hantai before - and he's recorded Scarlatti before -- but I must admit that while I was previously impressed by his work, this time I'm downright dazzled. I'm hoping we'll see more in this series."
4,sounds good !,"Pretty good CD. I'm cetainly not a music critic so bear with me.I have an eclectic taste in music and if you are looking for something very interesting, this is a good CD to buy.It seems like a fusion of jazz, funk, hiphop. The price is right so if you are at all interested, I would say ""do it"".I'm from Baltimore so I was also interested in hearing what a local band had to offer. I was very pleased and would like to see them play next time they are in town."
4,another good album by LT,"Not as concisely put together as their latest release, Another One Lost (which seems geared more towards the mainstream and has more lyrical songs), but still up there. The best song is easily ""Sounds From Below."" One more thing it has that AOL lacks: saxophone and longer songs. I also recommend their hard-to-find live album, Alone At Last, though w/the exception of a few songs, it's an experimental version of AOL in-the-making (song ""#2"" alone makes it worth buying, however). Their first, self-titled album is also good and has more of a jazzy feel to it than their successive albums."
3,Blackjack is blackjack...,"Atari did nothing to make owning their version of blackjack worthwhile. However, if you're into the novelty of Atari games and you find this title cheap (I paid $0.95) then by all means go for it!"
3,"socially conscious and politically correct, but not hard science","Please see my review of the hardback edition of this book under the title""Biology: A Community Context Student Edition (Hardback)"". The c. date of the edition I read is 2003. It requires a series of videos separate from the book. I do not know if the paperback edition also requires them."
5,A great book!,"Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are teenagers now and off to Paris, the City of Light, to flim the new movie Passport to Paris. The girls have a great time shopping, eating snails!, and riding on montorbikes with two handsome french boys. They each talk about how pretty Paris is and they have a great time there. This a great inside scoop of the hit movie."
1,"repetative, lacking detail, nonlinear time scale","While a fascinating topic I know little about, this book was very hard to read. It is definitely not for history lovers who want to be introduced to King Philips War and the times around it. Rather, it is for readers who already know all the facts they want to know and who want to read a detailed discussion of the relationship between English colonists and the local Native Americans.The main theme of the book is interesting, and the author does have a fresh point of view. But she hammers her point so hard she has managed to drive the life out of the book.The decision to discard a linear time scale in the book was very distracting, especially for this reviewer who was not that well versed in the actual time course of events.On a positive note, the decision to include direct quotes from writers of the period with intact spelling was a great one, these tidbits into the past are what ultimately make the book worth reading."
3,disappointed,In the Name of War is a revisionist interpretation of King Philips War. This is not a history of the war and provides an example of how the colonists at the time interpreted various aspects of the war. From seizing of colonists to selling Indians into slavery the effects of the war were traced throughout the war period. The brutality of the war is captured through the narrative that she lays out but in the end you really have to be interested in the time period to get something out of it. Like many things written about Indians there is a general feeling that the author must apologize for not being an Indian writing about Indians and that comes through in this book. In the end it is lackluster and boring with little for those looking for a history of the war.
4,Some deep thoughts about our past,"This book, by presenting a little studied war in our colonial days, shines a brilliant spotlight on many of our concepts of ourselves, our destiny, and our frequent ability to ignore reality in the justification of our actions. A well written book about the time between the 'Pilgrims' and the 'Colonials' that we have all heard about in school. Very worthwhile reading!!"
3,Demonizing Literacy,"Lepore makes much of the fact that the history of King Philip's War was written by the victors. That is not much of an insight -- victors always write the histories. But she goes one step further, it seems to me, by attempting to demonize literacy -- whether it's the literacy of the English or that attained by John Sassamon. This is a curious stance for a writer to take. As for the non-linear nature of her narrative, I didn't find that to be a drawback."
3,"Solid work, but watch out for the Kindle version.","Lapore offers an interesting look into King Phillip's War and in particular the cultures involved. Her work gets a solid four stars. I would have liked to give her five, but she makes a few too many leaps about the mental state of peoples without hard evidence. But her opinion on events is an interesting one and for the most part is backed up by her research or the research of other scholars in the field. But as a Kindle version it gets 2 stars. There are no page numbers, and in a presentation of research that is an absolute quality killer. No pages means no reference, which means no meaningful discussion with peers. There are also multiple errors related to poor adaptation to the digital format. I regret buying the kindle version now."
1,Boring Left-Wing Polemic,"If it wins a Bancroft Prize, you know it's bad (Remember how ""Arming America"" was exposed as a complete fraud?).One gets the sense that Lepore took one too many women's studies classes as an undergrad. Read Daniel Mandell's history of King Phillip's War for a real history of the conflict or Philbrick's ""Mayflower."" If you want to learn about the war, and not all the ""feelings"" that may or may not surround it, then avoid Lepore at all costs."
2,"Interesting discussion on war ""spin""","As has been stated by prior reviewers, this book makes some valid observations on the language of war, but the lack of a chronological account and the repetitive speculations as to the motives of the NEers, make an otherwise well written book and its gifted author bypass an oppotunity to bring this War to a new generation."
2,Not a history,"For those interested in the story of this war, go elsewhere. It is not here.The book is a speculation on the motivation of participants in the cultural conflict, and its consequences. I did not like the frequent suppositions-often they seem to be a figment of the authors imagination though no doubt founded in her vast knowledge of the subject. It just doesn't hold up as an historian's analysis."
1,Beware - not original recordings!,"This cd has many re-mixed songs, so you are not getting the original artists. However, The online description does not warn you of this! Save your money!"
5,A Wonderful CD,"One thing I must say is that Paul Heaton has the most beautiful voice I have ever heard in my life. I simply love listening to him sing "" I'll Sail This Ship Alone"". The lyrics are satiric and entertaining to listen to. ""Old Red Eyes Is Back"" is my favorite song. I am so glad I own this CD. The only thing is that they are never in the U.S. For an adolescent teen who must listen to her peers flap their mouths about people with no talent like Britney Spears, Usher, and Alanis Morisette, listening to Paul Heaten, David Hemingway, and Jaqueline Abbott, who have real talent, is a relief."
4,"a bit on the twee side, but...","although this band makes me cringe a few times, i have to admit that they can pen some wonderful pop tunes. the music is mostly piano-based with some light orchestral touches. there are plenty of lyrical bits containing satire and humour, some off-handed and some direct. and some downright touching songs such as ""Sail This Ship Alone"" and ""One Last Love Song."" unfortunately, some truly god-awful moments on this album force me to push the skip button (""36D,"" ""My Book"")...but even with all the bad goofy moments, no one can deny the pure shimmering beauty of ""Everybody's Talking."" i would recommend this band to any fan of Belle and Sebastian or The Divine Comedy or even stuff like Barry Manilow. good dramatic, quirky pop music...very pop..very British."
4,"Good as Gold, Stupid as Mud, he'll carry on regardless","With this collection of songs from a band unknown to most Americans, I find myself tapping fingers as I listen to this new found treasure. I especially like many of the witty lyrics and some of the satire and sarcasm they contain (i.e., Song for Whoever). They seemingly play on some of the ironies and oddities that life and love have in store for us all over a lifetime. Certainly, if the lyrics are any indication, this is band that didn't take themselves too seriously and likely had great fun penning and performing these gems. As with any complete collection of songs, I prefer some of the songs over others, some of my favorites being Song for Whoever, 36d, Let Love Speak up Itself, Bell Bottomed Tear, One Last Love Song, and Prettiest Eyes (even with the onset of those crows feet). Also, the album contains a nice cover of Fred Neil's 1966 song ""Everybody's Talkin'"", made famous way back in '69 by Harry Nillson."
5,I went to Oxford,"What do I think of the Beautiful South? I think they are an absolutely fantastic band. They are one of the best bands that I have ever seen, they are absolutely SPOT ON. I remember first seeing them back in 1989 and I thought ""well, there's a band"" and now having just listened to their Greatest hits I was damn right all along. To confirm my opinion, they are a flipping good band."
3,I SPY School Days (Jewel Case),"My 6-year-old son has all the other I SPY computer games and loves them, so we thought he would love this one as well. He doesn't. It probably would have been better if we started him on this one since it seems to be easier than Treasure Hunt, Fantasy, and Spooky Mansion. (It does say ages 5-9, where the others indicate they're for ages 6-10.) Also, it says it's compatible for Windows XP, but only if you switch down to Windows 95 through Windows Compatibility Wizard. Even then, it kept crashing, which of coarse means that it didn't save the puzzles my son completed, so he had to keep starting over. Even so, he thinks the puzzles are fun. It's just not his favorite."
1,Worst game ever!,"I purchased this item because my son loves playing the i spy funhouse. The problem is that not only are you unable to play it on newer computers, it also has some type of spyware on it that creates havic with desktop images and other visuals. It resulted in a costly repair. Had I known that it does not work well with windows xp (which it says it does) I would have never purchased the product. Maybe the ispy manufacture needs to find a better way to enter into the 21st century. I had the same problem with ""can you see what I see?"" Dream maching--Don't buy that one either--it's a huge waste of money!"
5,Another winner from Alfred Price,"Once again, Price has produced a winner. If you want to learn something about one of the greatest planes of WWII you won't go wrong purchasing this book."
4,A good read but too much fluff,"Garber is a good writer who writes a good story. . .But he uses too much fluff in telling the story Whirlwind. I just finished Vertical Run, which Garber wrote in 1995, and he didn't use superfluous words. Both are 'take-no-prisoners' heroes and good reads that keep one's interest. Still, I like the Vince Flynn 'Mitch Rapp' books much better."
4,Hopscotch-ish,"If you remember the book Hopscotch by Brian Garfield, and the movie based on it that starred Walter Matthau, then you'll have a good idea as to what this book is like.The plot centers around an older ostracized spy being brought back in to help 'The Government' solve an otherwise unsolvable problem. Of course, as in many of these books, there are grudges being held and old scores to settle. The fun of this book is in watching the older spy run rings around his opponents, and also the way he influences a younger spy to come along to his way of thinking. The book is highly entertaining and made for a good read.If I were Brian Garfield and I heard about this book, I might decide to see just how many similarities there are between Hopscotch and Whirlwind. Can you say 'lawsuit?'"
3,Whirlwind,"I read and loved Vertical Run. It was an original, fast paced, darkly funny thriller that kept me guessing throughout. Such was not the case with Whirlwind. It's pretty standard thriller fare. While I found it mildly entertaining, when it was time to return it to the library and I still had a little less than half the book to go, I didn't feel the need to renew it so I could finish. While I don't reccomend it, I wouldn't warn you off it either. If you're a thriller fan, I suppose you could do worse."
4,On par with his other book,"I loved Vertical Run. So as I was looking on my bookshelf, I was wondering if Mr. Garber had written another book. And he's not that prolific of writer. But we've got Whirlwind which I did enjoy. I'd say that Vertical Run was a little bit better but I'd have no trouble endorsing this book. Good characters. Well written. Try it."
1,Atrocious Waste Of Time,Vertical Run is an excellent novel. It is hard to believe that Whirlwind was written by the same author. Do not waste your time on this book!
2,Over the Edge,"There is over the top and then there is over the top and right over the edge. Whirlwind is the later. I read to the end because it was just so absurd, so overwrought, so silly that I found it amusing. Basically a romance novel for guys."
5,amazing,"Pros: tiny size, readable display, intuitive controls, great sound, FM radio, recording capabilities, equalizers and sound enhancement settings that actually work, mass storage device (usable as a flash drive).Cons: awful-looking necklace earbuds (ugh!), sometimes iffy radio reception, USB charger cable w/ large magnetic shielding actually bulkier than the player itself.Overall, a very nice player in an amazingly small form factor."
4,Nice alternative to iPod,"I bought the 2GB version recently. Nice product. Very simple to use. Good sound. Lots of extra bells and whistles that I might not use too often (e.g., voice recorder, clock, record radio, etc.) A major plus is that it will play any file type (or at least all the ones I have), unlike the iPod which only play certain file types. My one unexpected complaint is that even though it is a very small package, the ""chunky"" square shape makes it feel bigger than it really is. In some respects, a flatter device might seem smaller. Also, as many others have noted, the earphones stink. The sound is OK, but the ""neck lanyard"" set-up results in too many wires to get tangled, plus they keep falling out of my ears! Fortunately, the Mobiblu uses a standard headphone jack, so all the headphones from other devices will fit. Just plug in your favorite headphones and you're all set."
1,NO customer service from MobiBlu - BEWARE,"Admittedly, the player is extremely small and fairly easy to use - no complaints there, but about after 6 months of moderate use, the unit died. I tried to contact Mobiblu customer service, but due to ""High Call Volume"" all you can do is leave a message and the will get back to you ""at their earliest convenience!!!"" So far its been about a dozen messages and over a month, and it hasn't been 'convenient' for them yet. If you dont believe me, try calling Mobiblu customer service yourself, and see how you fare. 1-888-283-2580 All I can say is BUYER BEWARE, and this is the last Mobiblu product I or any of my friends will ever buy."
1,Couldn't Even Keep the Right Time,Was just going through some old orders and I see nobody reviewed this so I thought I would warn anyone who was going to buy this. Sure it's only 10 bucks but spend an extra 5 or so and get something better. Over a few days time it would get to like 6 minutes ahead. So a number of times I reset it to the right time and sure enough it would be off after a few days. Then I even tried to set it 6 minutes behind the right time so it would even out. Still managed to pass up what time it was and go ahead. I have a Sony now and have had no problems with it for years.
5,The favorite cookbook in my kitchen!,"BUY THIS BOOK!!! This is a cookbook like no other. I have many cookbooks that I will look at for hours but never make anything out of. Then I have a few from church fundraisers that I use for tried and true recipes. But this cookbook gives you the best of both worlds with an added bonus, it has the history of cooking (The who, what, when, where and whys of Jello and the ingenious things you can do with it), recipes (Why are chocolate chip cookies called Toll House?, Find out!) trends that have taken place over time. It also tells why certain ingredients can make or break a recipe. The author writes in such a way that this is a cookbook that read likes a novel, both interesting and entertaining but then you have the desire to actually go to the kitchen and try out her words of cooking wisdom. I've used many of the recipes time and again. I have purchased this book as a gift for my grown children and as a bridal and wedding gift. Everyone should own it. :-)"
5,"The most versatile, entertaining and useful cookboooks","We love cookbooks and have a great library of them. But if for some crazy reason,we were only allowed one cookbook, it would be ""The American Century Cookbook"" by Jean Adnerson. It has great recipes--and 100s of them. And you can sit down and read this lively, anecdotal book like a novel."
2,Poor fit on 2000 S430 (W220),"Have used many Mann filters w/no problems, however, this one was not an exact fit. The rubber side gaskets (vs. a fleece material on previous filters) caused the two filters (which are installed side by side) to bind on insertion. I had to remove the rubber foam gasket from one filter in order to fit. This removal compromised the structure of the filter resulting in much cursing and use of tape. Mann is always good about including instructions, however, the sheet for this product referred to the E series - not sure if there is a problem here. Recommend you look for filters with the ""fleece"" (looks like the non hook side of velcro)to ensure proper fit in this application.All in all will continue to buy other filters @ Amazon as they offer good value for money and prompt shipping."
2,"Where's ""Christmas with Friends""","I was excited to see this collection then very depressed to see the ""Christmas With Friends"" special was not included. If you don't remember, this was a 30-minute special, mostly music from Doc and the band, and ""The Night Before Christmas"" narrated by Ed Mcmahon. NBC used to show this on or around Christmas night, when Johnny didn't put on a Tonight Show. The CD of the music is available, but I'd love to have a copy of the show on DVD. This seemed like a natural place to put it, but no such luck.Another disappointment in the largely disappointing series of Carson DVD's."
1,I broke my own rule,"I broke my own rule for shopping on Amazon: check out the customer reviews before buying. If I had done that, I would have saved myself both money and disappointment. These episodes are edited crudely (very choppy) and on my copy, the sound and picture are not in sync. There are 3 episode included here, all reduced to fit in 72 minutes, so you get very little continuity.I miss Johnny Carson, but this is no way to remember him."
1,not the best of Johnny Carson,How did these episodes get onto this DVD? All from the 1980's and not that much Christmas stuff and not that funny with not that famous of people. I still miss Johnny and this is a DVD we watched once and won't watch again!!!!
5,One of the best first efforts I have read in years!,"I was immediately pulled in by this novel. Having worked with populations something like these, I felt I was once more standing on dark street corners and dealing with rough trade. This is the ultimate ""film noire"" book, because of the atmosphere and because of the main character's disability. As a professor of psychology, I kept looking for errors in the the description of the main character's disability. They were not apparent. The development of this woman was fascinating. Well done !!! I am looking forward to this becoming a film. Although it is a different genre, I cannot help but feel the main character is somehow related to Ridley of "" Alien"" fame. The only difference is that the monsters are us. Humans are far more frightening than anything science fiction writers can dream up. This is a great first effort."
1,One of the worst I've read in a long time,"This book had no suspense, the characters were flat--in fact,Kay was so flat it made no difference if the author had made hereither a man or woman. She did seem androgenous, as did everyone in that book. There was no need to keep repeating about her color blindness--which the author made sure we were aware of on at least every page. It became clear who the killer was about one third into the book, and then it just dragged on and on--all these boring little sequences about Kay's akido class and her mentor. It was poorly written and read like a diary. Also, the author's perception of San Francisco seems way off--walking from the Hall of Justice to Pacific Heights is a long long way, all uphill, not something you do in ten minutes. He makes it sound like everything in SF is ten minutes apart by foot. And what woman prowls the streets of rough areas at night, alone, and with an expensive camera around her neck? Come on, give me a break."
4,"Fierce Woman, Complex multi level plot","Just read a publisher's preview copy. Very strong first person narrative by a woman as fierce as Smila (Smila's sense of snow), or Mallory (O'Connor). The story swept me up. I cared about the people. Author has a bit of a problem with the plot at one or two points and has to slip out of 1st person to describe something the narrator doesn't know about, but I forgive him. The story was quite unexpected and each time I thought it was resloving itself, a little bit more explanation would make the resolution even more interesting. I hope for LOTS more of this character and autho"
2,Decent start foiled by flaws,"This book started out well enough, but the author lost me somewhere in the middle. He was so busy explaining how marginalized people are really great, that he forgot to include much of a plot. Other annoyances: The bad characters are obviously bad from their first appearances; The lead character, Kay, is living too well in SF for what she earns and somehow turns into an ace detective overnight.To be fair, my favorite suspense/thriller authors are folks like James Ellroy, Ian Banks, Nelson Demille and Walter Mosley, where nearly everyone is bad to some degree,you are never quite sure what will happen next and bad things happen to main characters. The author matches these guys in atmospherics. The San Francisco backdrop was probably my favorite part of the book."
3,Good Plot But Slow Going,"This is a good story but David Hunt is more of a writer than a storyteller. The pull to solve the mysteries was strong, but the writing style slowed the pace to a crawl at times. The characters, for the most part, were well drawn and interesting. For some reason the love interest of the main character just didn't ring true. Overall, a pretty good read but it doesn't have me rushing out to by Mr. Hunt's next novel."
5,Best vocabulary textbook for middle school,"As a teacher, I have reviewed many vocabulary texts and have never found one as effective as Word Wealth Junior. Students who have used this text have consistently scored much higher on standardized tests than those who used the typical vocabulary workbook."
4,Pleased With The Purchase,"I bought this watch because it looked sweet in the store and it did everything I needed it to do. I have not tested the interval timing and storing runs a whole lot, but the basics work well, and the controls were not too tough to figure out.The only bad part was the buttons were (and still are) sticky. Also, the button that turns on the button pressing sound always gets hit by my coat sleeve, which is pretty annoying. I would have given it a 5/5 if it weren't for these couple things."
4,"Inexpensive, chic watch","I bought a few of these watches to take to give my teenage relatives in Morocco during a visit this year. They were quite a hit, Nike is a very popular brand there. I spent quite a lot of time setting up the time and date of each watch, I had to look at the instructions frequently as I found the setup not at all intuitive (I usually figure out 90% of electronic devices without referring to the instructions). Three months later all are still happy with their watches, so I guess you can't say fairer than that"
1,"Not exactly what I wanted, the seller do not reply e-mails","The watch itself is working, but one of the buttons stoped working after 5 days.I sent an e-mail to the seller asking what I should do to return it and get another one and the seller simply ignored my e-mail.If you want to buy this watch go ahead, but do not buy it from Watchsavings."
2,grandpa's surprise,This wasnt' the book I had wanted. Instead it came as 4 little books about bunnies. The books had been used a lot. I passed them on to my granddaughter.
3,Too much fun!,"An irresistible romp, reading this is like eating a box of Godiva chocolate truffles in one sitting. You may feel a bit guilty afterwards! Our heroine is a lust-filled married woman with a cold, cold husband. Poor dear, she turns to the muscular and handsome gardener (yes, the gardener) who tends the plants at her office. Shades of Lady Chatterley! There are plenty of ""naughty bits"" though nothing outright pornographic. The protagonist is a therapist but seems to have her own anger control issues. Almost every discussion with her husband ends with her throwing something.... Not that we blame her: As the story goes on, the husband turns out to be a dirty rotten cheating scoundrel. On top of that, there are office politics, scandals and rivalries. Everything is over the top and not very believable, but fun. Oh, and beware -- the ending is a cliff-hanger, so you feel compelled to get the next book in the series."
1,Awful ending and extremely unrealistic,"This book was engrossing like a car wreck, it became ridiculous and made it hard for me to respect the main character. It really was a soap opera, and there was no ending - the author does not wrap up the story; she wants you to buy the rest of her books. Totally disappointing and not worth it. Save your money and buy Bridget Jones or Confessions of a Shopaholic. More entertaining and satisfying, in my opinion."
3,Definitely not the best of this wonderful trilogy.,I loved Steadfast Heart and Reckless Heart and searched for this book as the grand finale. I was pretty disappointed. I liked Graham and Berkely but the story line wasn't that great. I would have liked more than the last chapter devoted to the reunion and interaction of these 3 brothers. With all my Heart had so much potential but it just didn't quite get there. I love Jo Goodman's books and her men are wonderful!! Perhaps I expected too much.
4,Charming,"i generally make it a point to avoid reading trilogy's or a host of romances involving the whole family, but i liked this book particularly coz firstly they had a good old fashioned romance not a love-hate thing like most books it was just a nice book that leaves a smile on your face i thought it was just precious, the Grey and Berkely were well brought out and i have to say i like a little of the supernatural such as berkely's second sight it added a good dimension in the book. good buy."
5,With all my heart,excellent story line! Ms Goodman is one of my favorite writers. I love following the characters through their adventures.Highly recommend this book
4,"mainly what I want, come home to stop yearning","I want songs to get me excited. I Was Only Telling A Lie has been my favorite song when I think I know it, but there are still a few parts that I don't remember. Handy Man is beautiful, but somewhat unreal, because I don't see solutions to broken hearts. Traffic Jam was about to spread in 1977, when I thought ""about to have a heart attack"" was overreacting. Now I consider the roads so dangerous I even worry about going anywhere. James Taylor does not sound like he is trying to make people paranoid, so there is no need to act like he shot your dog, but this is still getting under my skin. Terra Nova ends with the crazy way I feel: I've come home to start yearning for what I feel when I hear this music."
3,JT- the best one,What an artist !!!! A great beginning for a great artist. A great album for any fan of his.
5,The Radiant Voice of Barbara Bonney,"The Radiant Voice of Barbara Bonney is a 2001 Decca Music Group starring soprano Barbara Bonney. Here we get to hear the amazing and world famous soprano sing Dowland, Orff and Pergolesi to mention a few. Bonney does not disappoint but wows the listener with her prowess. The music notes have been written by Richard Wigmore. Truly a stunning performance. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5."
5,A voice of gleaming silver,"I was inspired to buy this when I heard Barbara Bonney's deliciously cool voice singing Solveig's Song on WQXR/WNYC. I have never been lucky enough to see her in an operatic performance as she is seldom seen on the operatic stage these days. The CD is a treasure of impeccable performance. Ms. Bonney deals in perfection and cool beauty, not passion, and she is very good at it."
3,It wasn't that bad!,"This movie is like a Disney movie, the sing is unnessicary and annoying, but it's there anyway! The story would have been better if they tampered with it a little more. But even though this movie wasn't entirly bad, I would still buy the MST3K version instead. IT IS ABSOLUTLY HILARIOUS!"
5,a great book,not only is he a great musician but also a very honest man about life.the ups&downs of life and the music business.he comes correct and doesn't sugar coat nothing.very few artists are real and give any details.Mr. white has overcome alot and still continues to thrive.a must read book.
1,Medical AND Historical Incompetence Combined,"This book has achieved 'classical' status among a certain segment of the population that views history through an ideological lens without the need to process factual information. Unfortunately, this work is lightly regarded by professional historians who take competence seriously. The author has no competence in either the history of medicine and therapeutics, or clinical gynecologic pathology. The work relies primarily on secondary sources, is full of anachronisms, and is useful mainly as a good example of what medical and social history should NOT be. Thoughtful readers might like to read the devastating review of this book in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine. Don't waste your money on this one. Start with Shorter's A History of Women's Bodies or Irvine Loudon's classic Death in Childbirth, if you want to find out what women's lives were like, from a legitimate medical point of view, a century and a half ago."
2,T. Martin,"the quality of this product is fine, however it runs on the small side...if you normally take a medium be sure to order a size large for comfort....."
4,Love Owen!,This is pretty funny...maybe because I love Owen Wilson...but I don't feel as if you are wasting time that you will never get back. It's all good if you are just looking for some silly laughs.
4,Movies,Hubby likes both of these. A nice addition to his collection. He usually likes most movies Jackie Chan does.thank you
1,Terrible,"This is the biggest piece of bull I have heard in a long time! Why do people want to waste their time reading this crap? If you are looking for the truth, why on earth would you read a book that does nothing, but try to tear down and demean someone or something. This is obvious garbage. If you want to know about something, go to the actual source, don't go to someone who has a vendetta or whose only point is to tear down something. Truth builds you up and edifies you, it doesn't take the time to demean others and strive to prove them wrong."
4,I PUT OFF BUYING THIS,"because I teach math and I thought ""Oh, there won't be anything in this book that I don't already know."" WRONG! THis book is a browser's delight. As well as giving relatively clear directions on how to calculate a whole bunch of practical things, it gives away such secrets as how to do those annoying work word problems using only arithmetic, an easy way to do those annoying mixture word problems, how to weigh things using only nickels, the amazing relationship between nickels and the metric system,etc. Highly recommended."
5,Great!,"It cost more than I would normally pay for a cheese slicer, but it was well worth it. The slicer is heavy, adjustable & they even give you an extra *wire to replace the first one if need be."
1,Bad design for softer cheeses,"I tried to cut a block of mozzarella (not too soft really) and this product just didn't work well at all. If you set the slicer down flush with your cutting board you'll notice the problem immediately. The wire doesn't actually touch the cutting board, but floats above it just a little because the roller has a greater height. So basically when you go down vertically on your cheese block, at the end you'll have to kind of finesse it through to make an entire cut. This is a big problem with softer cheeses because the downward pressure you apply creates a bubble of sorts towards the bottom which gets caught up in the roller. I'm going to tryFox Run Marble Cheese Slicerand see how that works."
4,Cheese Grater,We were looking for a new cheese grater. And just came across this randomly. Love it! It arrived very quickly. We also got a spare. I would highly recommend this seller.
1,Not Pleased,"I was very disappointed with this slicer. The metal band came bent, and we could not tighten it at all. It wasn't a good deal even for the cheap price!"
5,My husband loves it,"I bought him 3 different kinds of cheese slicers (it's his ""thing""), and this is one of them. He likes the wire on this one and he kept it (along with the other 2)."
1,Useless piece of JUNK,"Cheese slicer that wont slice cheese,in fact I found it to be Junk, it took more time trying to fix it, than I can justify for a cheese lover like myself ,The dollar store one i previously had served me trouble free for many years before it finally broke , do yourself a favor and save yourself some frustration and time in the workshop,Buy a simple cheap slicer and get the job done :)"
1,"I normally don't give 0's, but this is a ZERO","My wife an I buy many things off Amazon and we trust the reviews and review what we buy. That being said, don't buy this cheese slicer. It is just awful. Really I can't say more than it is a pain in the butt. I do not have experience buying another slicer, but this is not one I would recommend. It just does not seem right, really, dental floss would work better other than the mint flavor, but at least you would not have to hand wash the dental floss."
3,Slippery When Used,"This cheese cutter looks prettier than it cuts. It needs better grip, and is not very easy for kids to use. But it looks good . . ."
4,Good product,"Appears to be a good product so far. Sturdy construction, easy to use, clean and maintain. slicing wire looks substantial and may last longer than other slicers. Would have preferred a more substantial handle."
2,Mangled cheese.,"I was in need of a new cheese slicer and wanted to believe the great reviews on Amazon. Now I have a cheese slicer whose line won't stay tight and mangles my cheese. But it does cut it, just mangles it as well."
1,Inconsistant and unpredictable,The wire which does the cutting is very loose. I presumed that it would be adjustable but it is the roller that's adjustable. The slices are inconsistant and unpredictable.
4,HEAVY METAL,"I was surprised at the heft of this little cheese slicer. The problem I have found is getting the adjustment right and not having it loosen by itself. Overall this is a quality product. It comes with an extra wire slicer part that must be stored separately somewhere, and I doubt I'll ever find it should the need arise (but others may be more organized and not find this an issue)."
1,"Loose wire, no adjustment","From the picture, it looked like a sturdy unit that would keep the wire tight for a clean straight cut. As-delivered, the wire was loose and continued to get more loose with use. There is no provision to tighten the wire. Wire finally broke and now I'm shopping for an alternative."
3,"Good idea, flawed execution","I bought this slicer to replace an Oxo that broke. The reason I did not buy another Oxo is that although I was reasonably happy with the Oxo, it sliced cheese too thick. I bought the Norpro because it has an adjustable slicer feature. Unfortunately, other details of the product make it not worthy of more than 3 stars. My two major complaints are that (1) the handle is too small relative to the rest of the slicer, making it difficult to get leverage on it (the Oxo is much better in this regard); and (2) with the Oxo I could get a clean slice, top to bottom. With the Norpro, the slicing wire is offset from the center and either because of that, or other design features, it won't slice cleanly to the bottom of the slice, and usually there is a jagged piece at the bottom where the slicing wire did not make it all the way through the block of cheese."
2,"handle too small, hard to adjust","I read all the wonderful reviews and after a week-long price watch (it was jumping up and down), I finally ordered. What a bummer. The handle on this slicer is too short. It is so awkward to hold it. And to adjust thickness of a slice, you need to unscrew not 1, but 2 screws (one on each side instead of one is the middle) and make sure they are both even, otherwise your slice is going to be crooked. Blah. Disappointing."
1,It broke,"Norpro Cheese SlicerOnly used it a few times.Never cuts all the way through the cheese.Today I was slicing some Swiss that was apparently too tough for it and the wire broke. I can't find a replacement wire and even if I could I think I don't want the hassle of replacing it.Until I find something that has better reviews and doesn't use a wire, I'll go back to using a knife."
4,Works just fine,"Its better than a knife, not quite as great as a cheese slicer with a board attached. Three more words required"
3,Didn't realize how big/heavy it was,"None of the reviews really touched on how heavy this slicer is. I bought it as a replacement for an old lightweight wire cheese cutter, but this guy carries quite a bit of weight. I very much appreciate that it came with an extra replacement wire but not sure it is for me."
2,Short handle.,"This unit is solidly built and might slice wood LOL but the handle is far too small. It should be at least twice as large as it currently is. I’m not really satisfied. It’s a little like putting a small engine in a Cadillac. It works, but could be a lot better with a couple changes."
1,cheese slicer,You have to use a screwdriver to change thicknesses of cheese. I am very disappointed in this item. The information in guidelines should have told the customer how you had to adjust it.
2,Is it better than a knife,"Ok, I bought it because it looks elegant when serving cheese. But in reality, my knife works better. A must for every junk drawer....."
4,Way better than 'good grips',"After a month or two my 'good grips' slicer was unusable.This cost about the same, and is much higher quality. Comes with one replacement string. The adjuster is a little finnicky, but is manageable. You can take it apart to stick it in the dishwasher, but it's not the easiest to put back together. Just don't machine wash the adjuster knobs, or they will rust I believe.It slices through cheese very easily, and can adjust from very thin to very thick slices. Made the perfect burger:cheese ratio today.I'm very satisfied. Just wish it was 100% dishwasher safe. Another review mentioned getting thumb screws from the hardware store. I'm going to try that out."
3,Split decision,"In some ways, this is the best cheese slicer I have ever owned, and in other ways it is lacking. It is surprising to me that a product that is so well designed at the cutting end would be difficult to use. The problem - the handle is VERY uncomfortable and really too small to provide good leverage. I have pretty large hands, but even so, the handle is like trying to hold on to this thing with something not much larger than half a pencil. Hopefully, it will be redesigned in the future with a handle about 1 1/2 inches longer and much bigger around. Then it would be almost perfect."
5,good slicer,I like this slicer. The wire is heavy gauge and it's adjustable. It comes with an extra wire. It does a good job slicing cheese.
3,Norpro Cheese Slicer,"Like it, it is heavy, it takes skill getting the wire to be equal but a good slicer. it costs more that my fathers aluminum slicer, and his only had one wing nut to screw, wish I had bought that version instead.It is fine, not perfect."
5,10 Stars for this!!,"Well I was expecting this to be a small, flimsy cheese slicer like the one I had when I was a kid. That's actually what I was looking for, and what I really thought it would be, for the reasonable price. But when I opened up the box, WOW was I pleasantly surprised! I can't believe how sturdy this guy is, and the wire is nice and strong, too. I love that it comes with an extra wire, for years of use, with any luck. I only wish there was a little box to keep the extra wire in, because it might be a challenge keeping it straight. I took out the plastic packing material and flattened it, then wrapped the wire in it. I think that will keep it safe in my silverware drawer. 10 stars for this item for sure!!!UPDATE: Yup, as I expected, the extra wire ended up getting bent. I really wish they'd include a box to keep it in, but still, I really love this slicer!"
5,slicer,"The cheese slicers arrived before the quoted time and were exactly what as expected, I do wish it was possible to cut slightly thicker slices but am completely happy with the product"
1,Wire stretched with second slice of cheese,The wire stretched with the second slice of cheese. It is evident that when it was assembled that the knots in the ends of the wire were not pulled tight. Can not get a new wire.
3,Norpro Cheese Slice,"This one is similar to my old one, but not as well made. The slicer does not tighten as well as it should. I would not buy another one. Plus, I still need to get a usable cheese slicer."
2,Not what I expected,"This product claims you can adjust it easily for different size cheese slices but it isn't designed to hold the bolts/screws in place. When you start slicing the cheese it has a habit of ""re-adjusting"" on its own and it doesn't appear as though one can tighten the screws/bolts sufficiently to avoid this.Regarding its ""adjustable"" claim, it isn't sufficient to produce the claimed results."
1,Poor,I bought this as a gift for Christmas and was sad to hear that the wire broke on the second time it was used. )-:
3,"Incredibly insightful, but incredibly boring","In my senior history class, we had to read either this book or Why Nations Go to War by John Stoessinger. We've been discussing the causes of war and the commons misconceptions that different historians have held. I found Blainey to be precisely on the mark in his analysis. The information he presents is hard to refute. However, I felt he made his point a little too well, if you know what I mean. I found myself stuck in example after example. After an interesting first 150 pages, I found myself dreading finishing it. It's just too bland for my taste. If I were you, especially if you're in Dr. Igo's class like I am, I would read the first 7 or 8 chapters, read the first page and the last page of the other chapters, and read the summary at the end of the book. That's all you really need to know."
5,great product great price,"I have to say that when I saw this online I had to get it, I am not due until July and it is so cute for the money. I do wish that it came with a ruffle but you get a plain white or pink, depending on what your having. I love this set ...."
5,Wish I could sleep in the crip...it's so cute!!,"Very happy with this product! The price was incredibly right. Very soft comforter and bumbers. I havn't washed it yet but certainly feels like it will all hold up well and just get softer. Other reviews are right, the picture does not do the colors and the cuteness ANY justice. We don't know if our little bundle is a boy or girl, but either way, we're sure he/she will love their crib decor as much as mommy and daddy do!"
5,I LOVE THE BABY POOH SET,"I RECENTLY PURCHASED THE 4 PC BABY POOH, LAMP AND MOBILE. I LOVE HOW SOFT THE COMFORTER IS. THE COLORS ARE GOOD FOR A BOY OR GIRL. I KNOW MY BABY GIRL IS GOING TO LOVE THE LAMP, WHICH IS ALSO A NIGHT LIGHT. I RECOMEND THESE ITEMS."
4,VERY Cute set!!!,"My Mother in law bought this for our baby girl due in 9 weeks. I LOVE it. It is the cutest thing! The colors are wonderful and bright! The characters are oh so adorable. The only down side is that this is a limited line. There is no dust ruffle or curtain that matches. I did find a dust ruffle on ebay with the same colors and it works great. But overall, this was just too cute to pass up!"
3,Very Cute!,"This crib set is so cute, you'll fall in love with it. The only thing i really did not like about the set was the stuffing fiber for the bumpers. It was a very itchy stuffing unlike cotton, which is hard since my son loves to snuggle into things. Other than that make sure it will fit because we got a sleigh bed and we had to make modifications to the ties to fit."
5,Totally worth the money!,I bought this item for my four month old daughter and I am really satisfied. It was alot cheaper than most of the other products that I viewed and in my opinion jus as good. It's really worth the money and I would recommend it to everyone.
1,Not very good,"The English word ""because"" is not in the English/Dutch section of the book. Just one example of common words not included. Other things missing - pronounciation, gender of nouns, nuances of words ex - facetious). It is easy to read, but I would go for a point or two smaller type to get more words, etc. in."
2,Descriptive talent but depressing,"I have to agree with Calyndula on this one--and more so. This book shows real talent in creating a sense of place and mood, but I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters enough to finish the story. With Perfect Love, her next book, Buchan found a more sympathetic voice--recommended."
4,An excellent introduction to Turkish gypsy music ..,A love of Turkish music does not come naturally to western ears- It's raucous tempo - especially in the Gypsy version- and the multilayered complexity take time to appreciate. This CD is an excellent introduction to the genre - authentic but accessible. Good for belly dance music also.
2,another wasted album,this album was worse than we come strapped in some ways.his production was better to me and thats what saved his album.it still doesn't take away from the fact that its still wack.his lyrics were horrible for example run what the hell is mo drama fo yo mama mo drama mo shootin mo buckin mo slicin mo dicin mo what ever this wack.then he talks about quick in every song quik aint botherd with him.eiht lyrics on this album was horrible i dont know what the hell he was thinking
4,INVESTIGATE THE OTHER SIDE OF LIFE,"I like this album. I like the Moody Blues. I like electronic synth music. I also like the Moody Blues earlier music. I appreciate the band's understanding of an ever-changing musical environment and the willingness to conform with integrity. I like the Moody Blues in all their transformations.THE OTHER SIDE OF LIFE is definitely a synthesized album, but the songs still maintain many elements of why I followed the band through their changes: great melodies, unconventional stylings and the Hayward/Lodge collaborations. It's not their most definitive album, but I love the title track---it's textured layering that validates its 7-minute length. It makes me wanna sing along; to sway to its infectious beat; I never tire of hearing this song. The other tracks are pleasantly diverting pop tunes. If you're a real Moody fan, enjoy their ability to survive five decades of pop confections. I still like them!"
3,Too much pop and not enough seriousness,The songs on this album that measure up to the Moodies long distance legacy are:Your wildest dreamsI just dont careRunning out of loveThe other side of lifeThe other songs are technopop BS...and fluff. They would have been best to combine these 4 tracks with the best material from THE PRESENT....Still a good album...if you can find a good clean used copy.....would be worth the price.
3,"Well, it's OK, but hard core fans may be disappointed.","Well, at this point, hard core fans are beginning to suspect that the Moodies are never going to put out another great album. And this one isn't great. But it does have three excellent songs, and at least two Moodies classics, Your Wildest Dreams, and The Other Side Of Life. In my view, It May Be A Fire is a neglected gem. However, I Just Don't Care, The Spirit, and Slings and Arrows should never have made it on the album. The Moodies do tighten up their sound on the album, but the material isn't up to what they once were capable of doing. Here they sound like ELO. I never thought I would hear a cliche love song from the Moodies, but Justin's I Just Don't Care is just that. But it is better than Sur La Mer and Keys Of The Kingdom, for what it's worth."
4,Time is on their side,"I can hardly believe the many negative reviews of ""The Other Side of Life?"" Outside of the classic 7 Moodies, this has always been one of my favorites and it is much, much better than most of their recent albums. If you're already a fan or a newer fan but are not familiar with TOSOL, I highly recommend you give it a listen or two and make-up your own musical mind. Far superior than Keys to the Kingdom or Sur le Mer and generally better than Strange Times, as well."
3,"An unusual album, but serves a purpose","I'm not a real fan of Moody Blues. I only became aware of this album because my sister liked the single Your Wildest Dreams, and I stole the tape and listened to it a whole lot.As a young listener, I really liked the album. This was prior to being exposed to most modern rock, when most of what I heard was Billy Joel. The album has a huge amount of simplistic charm. The melodies are easy to remember, and the inherent silliness of the layered keyboards is easy to ignore.Is it a good album? Sort of. As I stated, it's got a certain charm to it. This means that it might be good if you aren't looking to take it very seriously. If the 80s keyboard sound is endearing to you, you'll love it.Personally, I think this album is an excellent rock ""starter album."" It's innocent, and not corrupting, and for a listener of the right age, it rocks like nothing else."
3,Average,"Although I love the Moody Blues, this is not one of my favorite albums by them. It's got some great songs, but also a few that I just don't like that well. Still worth having for a true fan, however."
2,Truly The Other Side Of Life,"This is the worst Moody Blues album ever. Not much good came out of 1986, and the Moody Blues proved it with processed music and slick production. The best songs are the Hayward hits, including ""Your Wildest Dream"" and ""The Other Side Of Life."" The best Lodge song is ""It May Be A Fire."" The best Hayward/Lodge song is ""Running Out Of Love,"" and the other best song would have to be the Edge/Moraz song ""The Spirit."" The rest of the album is largely forgettable, and I would not recommend this recording, even to Moody Blues fans. All the other 1980's albums by the Moody Blues are at least 3-1/2 stars, but this '86 outing ranks the lowest at two stars."
1,Dull album from a bunch of has beens,"Even in their lat 1960s heyday, The Moody Blues were not exactly the most energentic band in the world. By 1986, this bunch of aging hippies had pretty much exhausted thier supply of interesting songs. I bought this album for ""Your Wildest Dreams,"" which is a pleasent enough single. But most of the rest of the album sounds like recycled ELO."
4,YEARS LATER,"Years later I still love this album. Crisp and straight-ahead songs from the decade that came after the clear water stuff the Moodys were doing in the seventies. Seems to me they lit up and took off again with new and powerful songs that captured many new listeners. That's part of the challenge--play new stuff to new people and keep moving. There's even an edgy sound on this recording. Enjoy it and sing along. ""Nothing stays the same."""
4,Simply Amazing!,"This album is simply stunning. The album is Killwhitneydead's heaviest album, and the most well composed. All the songs sound very distinguished and all have their own moments. This album is really good, not not flawless, that's why I gave it a 4 out of 5. There are some parts where the audio clips are a little too long, and prevent the overall flow of the album or ""music"". I still think that this album is worth listening, and worth buying. This band has worked on so much stuff, and this album came out to be the very best. I do agree that this band will release better music in the future as their music is constantly getting better within every release. Definitely check out the other albums!"
2,tiny watch,"even for someone like me with small wrists, this looks like a girls watch. the band looks nice. the face is also small making the clock and numbers a bit more difficult to read. the backlight is not very good. feels a bit cheap."
1,Dreadful,--very bad writing --very bad acting--undeveloped characters and bland story line--super gimmicky use of 3D with no attempt at originality--one of the worst movies in the genre; don't waste your money
1,TERRIBLE!! MISSING DISC! No Way to Contact Seller!,"Got this for a party, opened it tonight and only one of two discs was inside, and the disc included was the bonus disc. So, no go for the Valentine's party! And, I contacted Amazon, and they told me the only thing I could do was send it back, but I wanted to contact the seller to complain. It was clear that there should have been an extra plastic piece inside the case for the first disc, but it was completely ripped out. Lovely."
3,This movie was pretty good,Okay let's by honest this movie kind of sucks. It's a dumb slasher film when the director knows it's stupid and decides to have fun with the idea. The movie personally I think is entertaining and the ending is pretty good. I also thought the death scenes were really creative and the gore was great. You also get a 5 minute scene of a women running around from the killer and she is completely naked. But overall I really enjoyed this film
3,3D Looks Great!,"I saw MBV in the theatre and loved the 3d. I hoped I would get the same experience when I got the dvd. I was amazed. The 3d does workand it looks great. Very close to the way it looked in the theatre. Not all the 3d effects worked. I would say 95% of the movie workedin 3d. The movie itself would be fair to good if not for the 3d effects. I have been a fan of 3d movies my whole life. I am the first one who will scream about a bad 3d movie on dvd. You can find this movie on amazon and ebay for a buck. that's how much I paid for a used copy. I am going to buy another copy for my brother who is also a big film buff, and I know he will agree. I have seen horrible 3d movies on dvd like The Polar Express. Great movie, but what they did to the 3d in polar express was a crime."
2,good movie 3D sucks on dvd,loved the movie in theaters hate it on DVD. you have to wear the stupid pink and green tented glasses
3,ok,Not the best 3d movie..its has its parts but its no journey to the center of earth. .or avatar! Maybe one or two whoa moments.
1,Guacala,"esta pelicula no tiene ningun atractivo, su trama es pésima, los efectos 3D no son relevantes....no la recomiendo en verdad"
2,A little entertaining but mostly not,"I was expecting a better 3d experience and was not impressed with the story. Certainly, not worth the $5. A great 3d horror/gore flick is Final Destination 5."
4,3D Works,"Here's the thing: the 3D works. It isn't perfect of course, but it does work, not sure what everyone else is complaining about. Of course it isn't good as theaters, they've spent thousands of dollars upgrading to new 3d technology, if you want it to be as good as a theater then go to the theater but for a 3D experience at home it works fine. Must be user error."
1,Not 3d! More Like Blurry!,"Ok, After buying this horrible movie I realized that after the first 10 minutes of watching this I can't Even See the people! The 3d Was Terrible it was just Blurry and Unwatchable. Then I went to Flip the disk over and Where the 3d glasses were in the box it scratched the movie up so bad it didn't do anything but skip! This is a Horrible Buy! They shouldn't have put the 3d glasses where they scratch the disk.I'm Warning you The 3d DOES NOT WORK, If you like to waste money on a horrible movie and even worst 3d get this thing, But after you watch the 3d side you willl understand it is a horrible piece of crap."
2,my bloody valentine 3D,Ok not great.seen better my son likes it. I liked the last friday the 13th a little beter. would love to see some of the Lara adrain breed series made into movies.
5,3D Horror Film,i really like this movie espically the 3d all the strong violenceits a good horror movie to watchpeople who like the 3d movies would like this one
3,Excellent 3D Horror Movie.,I really enjoyed this 3D Horror movie it was good from start to finish you actually have to use the 3D glasses or the movie will be blurry and won't look good without the glasses this is actually the first time that I've ever seen a 3D horror movie and I've got to say it was a good movie and I'd recommend it to anybody that's a fan of horror movies I enjoyed this horror flick from start to finish and you won't believe who it is that is doing all of this until the end I'm not going to tell anybody who it is because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie yet.
3,3d glasses included???,"When I ordered this item I was under the impression that 4 sets of 3d glasses were included with the video. The sticker shown on the front of the box states that 4 sets were included. However, when I recieved my copy of the movie there were not any 3d glasses included with my purchase. Very dissapointed!!!"
3,3D Blu Ray,"This review is for the real 3D Blu Ray version of the film.The 3D is not bad, but it is not great either. There were a couple nice pop out shots, but the depth was kind of all over the place. There was a little more ghosting, than most movies. Overall I am glad I decided to check this one out in 3D. It does actually add to the movie, just wished it could have been done a little better.As far a the movie goes, I really did enjoy it. The acting was really good, and the dialog pretty believable. This movie wasn't as good a the original, but let's be real what remake has been, but if you just watch it a its own movie and not compare it to the original, this movie is really pretty good, and worth checking out!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!! Edward Scissorhands and Freddy Krueger packaged this movie!!!!!,"I went to the movies and saw this film and loved it. So I was excited for the DVD release. I bought it, got it out to my car and opened it, and couldn't believe how poorly this movie was packaged. It looked like Edward Scissorhands and Freddy Krueger played frisbee with it. I don't know maybe they had a five year old child in charge of packaging. The disc is double sided and the 3-D glasses are sitting on top of the 3-D side of the movie. Wal-Mart opened up ten copies and couldn't find me one that wasn't scratched to hell!!"
3,no thanks,for some reason I believe this to be real 3d not the kind that required paper glasses. i havent watched the movie due to that. But it was delivered in a timely manner
2,ALRIGHT NOT PERFECT,WELL THE MOVIE COMES WITH THESE 3-D GLASSES THAT ARE SO CHEAP AND THAT ENDED UP HURTING MY EYES AND GIVING ME A HEADACHE.THE GRAPHICS WERE ALRIGHT EVEN THOSE GLASSES HURT MY EYESAND THERE ARE A FEW BLOODY SCENES AND A PRETTY GOOD ENDINGID RECOMMEND RENTING IT UNLESS YOU GOT SOME NICE 3-D GLASSES
1,This is not a proper blu-ray 3D title. Very missleading.,"This is not a true blu-ray 3D title for 3D television sets. Instead it's a crappy anaglyph movie that comes with 4 pairs of red/blue glasses! Incredibly miss-leading. The same movie in theatres used proper 3D tech. With blu-ray 3D spec out, i can't believe they'd do this to their customers. If at least they clearly stated so on the box. Instead it's made to look like all other blu-ray 3D titles.When watching this movie in 3D with attached red/blue glasses, entire movie looks like all colors were faded and only green and grey left. This will give you a headache and leave you feel cheated.3D effects itself were a lot better in theatres. With fake red/blu glasses you do not get nowhere near the same 3d effect.If this was a proper 3D blu-ray, i'd rate the movie itself at 6.0 or better for fun usage of 3d effects.Disappointing."
1,Only thing ok is the 3D,"The movie itself has too much special effects and not enough story to keep interested, ends up being boring."
2,BLU RAY DISC WON'T PLAY,"Hi, just tried to watch this movie on my Blu Ray player. It doesn't work. All I see is the start up menu guy with Gas Mask and when I click enter hoping to enter disc menu the whole thing goes blank. Can anyone offer any advice? All my other Blu Ray discs work fine."
3,Just OK Movie,This was just an ok movie. it wasnt as scary as I expected( never saw original). Some of the 3-D was cool though. One thing I really hate anymore is seems like every movie thats rated R or unrated always has to have a naked woman in it. Give it a rest already.
1,This is NOT the movie you saw in theaters!!,"To all potential buyers, beware! This is NOT the 3-D version you saw in the theater. The disc has a re-done old style green and red 3-D treatment. It comes with Green/Red 3-d glasses. Compared to the True 3-d version seen in theaters, this looks like absolute crap. I could not watch it for more than 3 minutes without getting a headache, and the 3-d effects do not work nearly as well. The ONLY good thing about this release is that they give you the 2-d version on the flipside of the disc. No where on the product does it say you are getting a stripped down 3-d version. FAIL."
4,Great gimmick that works!,"This is a great port from the theatre version, I guess. Obviously, it won't match the huge screen feel you get from an actual projection theatre (although I didn't see the movie at the theatre) but I can tell. The 3-D actually works, it comes with 4 glasses to share with friends, the better and bigger screen you got, the better and more impressive the feature works. That aside, the movie itself wasn't bad. It was more than just a hack-n-slash film as it tries valiantly to build characters and a storyline, albeit absurd, with a straight face. The performances were great, with the exception of the lead, Jensen Eckles. All in all, great movie, worth the purchase if you are a fan of the genre."
2,disappointing 3D,Movie is a decent slasher flick plus amazon gave me a free viewing of the original so that was a bonus. Unfortunately the 3D was pretty inconsistent. There were some great shots but also a lot of ghosting.
3,movie,IT IS A GOOD MOVIE EXSPECIALLY WITH JENSEN ACKLES IN IT! WHAT A CUTIE EVEN IF HE IS IN A HORROR MOVIE.
4,4 stars for the 3D,"This is the best 3D take home movie I have seen thus far. We all know the plot, so this review is about the 3D portion of the film. I can still see lines around objects in some of the sences, BUT this has greatly decreased from previous 3D movies...no more people with 4 eyes LOL. I agree with the other reviewers, in that I can not get the 2D version to play. I'm also watching this on an HD DVD and Blu-ray player."
3,Not bad for a remake,"I was a huge fan of the original and this remake is not bad but not great. The story really does not change at all from the original. I have to say I was impressed with the 3-D affect. Better then I expected. I have a Samsung 50"" plasma and even with the cheesy 3-D glasses the come with it (what did you expect) it was not half bad. The gore level did not seem the same as the original and there really not that many scary parts. For the hardcore horror fan, watch it. For others, see the original."
3,"Paid for HD, Got SD","I've got no complaints about the film. It's a fun, silly, horror film. Plenty entertaining, exactly what I wanted.My complaint is with Amazon's streaming service. I have great reception and never have any issues. So I paid extra for the HD version of this film, but it only streams in SD to my television.So Amazon, my question to you is this; if a ""Testing Your Connection"" runs before your movies starts playing to determine the best data rate at which to stream, why couldn't that test run BEFORE someone makes a purchase so they can determine whether or not to spend extra money on HD or not???"
1,beware home video 3D,"I have not seen this movie but since they have never perfected 3D for the home market and the companies who care know that and do not release their 3D movies on dvd (Disney,Pixar) you can bet this is a blurry cheap production, no doubt using the blue and red glasses. Anyone who's checked out the last couple of 3D releases knows what I mean. Don't be fooled the people who put this out could care less about quality. Don't waste your time or your money on the joke. It's a 3D headache."
2,"Horrible slasher, in any dimension","Bush. This is Bush League.My Bloody Valentine is an extremely formulaic horror flick, geared for young teenagers and drunken, easily-amused gorehounds. However, the youthful crowd soon gets alienated by the insertion of full frontal nudity. And when the CGI-bloodbath gets splashed sloppily upon the screen, you might be ready to chop off some heads of your own.Throw in the bad acting, stagnant storyline, and ridiculous plot twists, and you have an easily-passable glossy-cute little horror show....and yes, I stayed in a Holiday Express last night"
3,Wish the 3-D on the DVD was as good as in the cinema...,"This film is one of my all time favorite movie experiences... in the cinema. The 3-D technology used for the cinema release was fantastic and insanely fun to watch. So, I bought it on DVD the day it came out because I could not wait to show my husband who had been unable to catch the cinema release.The 3-D technology on the DVD sucks. Everything is miscolored... the glasses are green and a pinkish-red color. Parts of it are blurry. Lionsgate should have either released in on DVD in only 2-D or found a way to mimic the theater experience. I am disappointed with the 3-D.Having said that, the film itself is fun. The 2-D version works fine... and Jensen Ackles is amazing in it."
2,good 3d cheap script,"What can i say, I'm a sucker for 3D. My bloody valentine has pretty good 3D effects, better than journey to the center of the earth. Now, if you're considering this movie for anything other than its 3D thrills, you might as well throw your money in the garbage disposal and forget about it. It's the cheapest most predictable story ever. 3D is good, axe flying at you is fun, prices on amazon are always a bargain. It's worth pickin up if a quick 3D thrill is all you're looking for. Quality, story, suspense....move along folks, nothing to see here."
3,I actually watched a scary movie,"I don't watch scary movies, but I had to see this one. It was pretty good, meaning I did have to look away from some scenes. The 3-D version is ultimately the best way to view this video."
2,took a long time,Just received movie yesterday I believe i deserve a partial refund since the movie came out weeks ago and it tok so long to get!!I am very disappointed
2,They tried to hard to put it in 3D,"I'm not sure about what went wrong, but I normally have to wear my 3D Glasses on top of my Glasses. So sometimes I notice that when its ment to be way out there in 3D, that you see a second part of that object. But this whole movie is trying so hard to be in 3D that almost everything was messed up and half their bodies had a green shadow next to them.It may be just me, but i think this movie was a one hit wonder in theaters. Maybe with some laser eye surg. on my part I'll watch it again, just to see if maybe its the fact that I wear glasses under the 3D glasses and thats why its not all the 3D jazz. But till then I wont be watching this anytime soon."
1,not a real blue ray 3d,"This was my fault for not reading the 3d reviews 1st.I already had seen the dvd before and knew that it came with blue/red glasses.However when I saw the BLUE RAY 3D version offered I figured that this version would take my regular 3D glasses.It didn't,it came with the same cardboard glasses I have from the regular version.What a rip-off !!! How I looked forward to seeing the pick axe come flying out the screen when the villian threw it at the car window.Its not Amazons fault,its my fault for believing that BLUE RAY 3D meant that it was the new format and not those b.s cardboard glasses.Of all the BLUE RAY 3D dvd's that I own,this is the 1st time i've felt like i was mislead.Two thumbs way down !!!!!!A standing booing ovation to whoever thought about putting BLUE RAY 3D on the cover !!!!!"
3,Gruesome and some good scares,"This remake hits the basic boxes for a horror film. The killings are graphic and quite inventive in some places, and the killer's approach does bring dread in the good way, so these count as a plus.The drawbacks are that it's all a bit contrived and there are few surprises. This film has its moments and is worth seeing, although the 3D only works properly in the cinema, where it does work well.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
4,A 3D gorefest,"With the remake trend showing no end in sight, it was just a matter of time before My Bloody Valentine would get remade and this film is actuly very good and with this in 3D even more of a treat.Ten years in a small town called harmony had a bad mining accident only one minner survived named Harry Warden and on Valentine's day he burtally murdered 22 people fast forward 10 years after that event just when they thought it was over someone is killing again and looks just like Harry Warden has he come back from the dead????My Bloody Valentine is a brutal gory horror show with a 3D touch, the kills on this film is as hardcore as they come and with the 3D glasses you would be cover your face to stop a blood, an eyeball or someone jaw from flying at you're face!so if you want a gore trip with something flying at you're face in 3D then you are in luck."
4,Quickie for all the Amazoners out there with limited time,"Restoring my faith in the 'remake' is this little pleasant surprise - My Bloody Valentine (2009)As a fan of the cult favorite from 1981, I was not the least bit disappointed*The plot had enough substance to keep your attention from the opening explosion to the final blow*The characters were dynamic enough to build care for their fate*The faceless killer was so detached from humanity and was an effective, believable, and down right scary adversary*The kills were as unique and memorable as they were gory*There was a healthy portion of full nudityAll in all, this was a carefully crafted, entertaining, and true to tradition modern take on the slasher film that's sure to please even the most critical genre fans out there8.3/10EnjoyE. RomeroP.S. I have the Blu-ray and I preferred the 2D version. It looked just as 3D as the 3D version with the green/pink glasses, only without the headache."
1,Did not fit my Motorola Cell Phone,"Was happy about the price so I ordered this battery. I believe that when I read the product description that this battery would fit my Motorolla T-720 cell phone. The battery arrived quickly but when I put it into my battery charger, the battery wouldn't seat. So I tried to put it into my cell phone so that the battery could be charged in the cell phone. To my disappointment and dismay, the battery is just a little too wide to seat in the T-720. Effort to return item too great for cost of item so will hold onto battery and hope that one day I have a cell phone that uses the battery or a relative that has a cell phone that uses this size battery. Wound up getting a replacement battery from Radio Shack which is probably what I should have done from the start, the price was competitive."
4,"Not my style, but I really do like it!","This is a great CD and I strongly recommend buying it. There are so many great songs on it and it's really unlike anything I've ever heard. Even if you don't think you'll like it, you probably will. Consider the fact that I usually listen to Korn, but I like this anyway. If you're an alternative fan but feel like something different, here ya go..."
1,An abomination,"While tastes vary, it is impossible to excuse their remake of ""Killing Me Softly""--one of the best love songs of the 70s, gentle, delicate, sweet. In their hands, it is overlaid with a loud, cheap, obscene hip hop beat that defiles the song (everything after 30 seconds in). They can do whatever they want with their own music, but they had no right to this. You can easily find the original by Lori Lieberman on the web."
1,Never received the CD- AWFUL,My credit card was charged promtly however I still have not received the CD. I bought 3 other CD's from other sellers that day and received all within a week. I will chalk it up to a bad experience and never use this seller again.
1,Do yourself a favour - opt for Andre 3000 instead,"I had been to a Fugees concert in Dublin. When the band started dropping bottles on their own fans I and many others were disgusted. Analysing this CD, most of the melodies are plagiarised from other artists - Enya, Abba etc (Some acknowledged, others not). I urge you - please do not support these people."
1,What???????????????????,"I dont know what this ""Wayne Maye"" Guy is talking about but the fugees are far from a ""monumental"" Group. Its a surprise to me that this is even considered Hip-Hop. 1 catchy radio single sells alot of records as the fugees and many others have shown but I wouldnt even consider their name when thinking of a influential or even a player in the game of music. Obviously Wayne doesnt know ANYTHING about music or he wouldnt have commented that ""Nas reigned supreme"". Are U kidding me? Nas? Thats a horrible joke I hope many eyes and ears dont have to hear or see. Giving credit to Nas, some (and I mean very few) of his songs are alright, but I wouldnt even say his name when asked who I thought did anything for rap. The Fugees can make good noise together and sing in harmony but Its far from what I would consider ""monumental"" much less mediocre."
1,This CD is the worst cd ever made,I bought this cd thinking it would be a good addition to my cd collection. After listening to it for less than 5 minutes i could not bear to hear this sound that fans of the fugees call music. They are not talented and should not be as famous as they are today. Don't buy this cd it stinks!
3,music fan,"i use amazon a lot and i could not believe when reading these reviews that everybody(even the editor) think that 2 of the songs are covers. ready or not is also a cover from a delfonics song. killing me softly is quite a good cover, however no woman no cry is totally unnecessary and is COMPLETELY mediocre when compared to marley. ready or not is still below delfonics. the rest of the album is vey ordinary and it is these three songs which stand out and they stand out because they are not the fugees original work."
1,"The singer is nice, the fugees; not so much.","The Fugees version of Killing Me Softly starts out with promise, Lauren Hill is a wonderful singer, AND THEN...the awful crappy drum patch starts. It sounds like it was sampled from a Casio kids keyboard found at the Goodwill. The producer turns it up way too loud in the mix and it overpowers everything, presumably to make it danceable, but who knows? And of course the stupid rapping! Horrendous. Tell you what, lose the Fugees, keep the singer and bring in some REAL musicians like the ones that played on the original Roberta Flack version. In the mean time, just listen to the original, it's 10 times better than this unfortunate exercise in modern faux hipness gone wrong."
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting a great deal more. For the most part the album is one-dimensional. The drum-tracks are void of authenticity which evokes memories of karoke-night. The music numbed me to sleep to the point that if there is a message on this album I certainly missed it.I would rather hear Wyclef pick up the guitar more, and hear greater input from Lauryn vocally.After all the hype, and Lauryn Hill's Miseducation album, I come away from this one feeling very disappointed. I hope Lauryn has established herself where she will not have to resort to this type of mundane production. Let's face it; the two best songs on the album are covers."
3,Maybe I was expecting too much,"After all of the hype, I decided I'd finally check the cd out for myself and while it is a pretty good rap album, lyric wise, nothing else really kept my interest. A majority of the beats sounded the same which was dull and dark. Some people may like dark music but I can't listen to the same simple music for a full album. As I said, the lyrics were pretty good but not enough to keep my attention. I'm not saying that this is a terrible album, but I'm not saying its a great one either. To me, its just a very overrated album. Very far from bad so I would suggest just listening to the samples before purchasing it."
2,better at the time,i used to like this album.i think it had more to do with all the covers.and now 3 years later it sounds like a puffy party instead of a grand break through.don't get me wrong i like wycliff as long as he isn't playing puff#2 and Ms. Hill is a good talent but vastly overrated.pras no comment.but this album was okay for it's time but not what it was all cracked up to be for me.even the album cover bites the godfather.ever heard of originality?
1,They did better solo.,I disagee with those who said that Lauren was the best Fugee. Wyclef is the man. Lauren has issues and is still working on them. Wyclef is so talented. The Score did not impress me as much as the Carnival and Ecleftic. Miseducation was great but it was nothing like Lauren's real style. So I still give it to Wyclef for keeping it real.
5,"FUGEES: ""the score"" is definitely worth listening to.","Sure, it has explicit lyrics, but it isn't anything you can't handle. If you liked songs like ""Nappy Heads"", ""Temple"", and ""Giggles"" you'll love this one."
5,NOW,"It's this simple.Buy this album now, and listen to it through right away.If you don't, you haven't lived.Yes, it is that good."
5,True Classic!,The soulful sound of Lauren Hill's vocals is just amazing! The CD is an excellent mix of talent! I highly recommend for any diverse collection!
5,this is reall music..,"this is real music back in the old days. THIS IS WHEN MUSIC HAD A MEANING. now its just money, guns, hoes the same crap. g unit could learn a lot from this cd...like how to write REAL music. good cd overall fugees. how many mics do i rip on the deli? mini money se missi many many many."
3,Great classic.,This is a great classic album that made the Fugees popular during that time. It also brought some shine onto the very talented and gifted Lauren Hill. This was one of my favorite rap CDs during the late 90s.
5,"BUFFALO SOLDIERS, DREDLOCK RASTAS!!!","THIS JOINT AS WELL AS THE FIRST ONE IS ON THE TOP OF MY LIST AS THE BEST HIP HOP ALBUM OF ALL TIME. CAN'T NOTHING TOUCH IT. NO MATTER HOW YOU TRY, YOU CAN'T DIVIDE THE TRIAD!!!"
4,TALENTED TRIO,"Classic, early 90s rap, before the neo-soul, spoken word, lets-try-to-deep movement came into the play, The Fugees were doing their thing trying to get people to think and had phat bass lines to go along with it. This is a classic from back in the day and every CD collection should have it whether you are a hip-hop head or not. Don't sleep on this talented trio, they are all talented and have proven to be stars in their own right, but together they offered listeners a fantastic collection of their work.The Score gets a top score from me....check it out"
3,Be aware,"Be aware when buying this product, that it does not have a vacuum on it despite being called a SkeeterVac. I missed that when ordering. It relys soley on sticky paper to trap the pests. There is also no fan to help them along to their doom. I have only had the product for a few days, and it has turned cold, so I am not sure how effective it will be. I once had a similair product called Mosquito Deleto and found it to be a very expensive way to kill a few dozen mosquitoes.This is not a state of the art device. Documention that came with it offered a coupon that expired on January 31 2005. Suggest that you shop around a bit before buying."
1,"Vo ""vac"" skeeter Vac","What a disappointment - The decription of this product by the manufacturer is intentially vague about what kills the mosquitos. Sticky paper attached to the CO2 ouput is the method here and not really all that effective. Living in Florida we have 3 gecco lizards stuck to the paper right now, struggling, drawing black flies as the die- Nice! Mean while the mosquitos are buzzing as usual. Would invest in the model with the vac.... had I known."
5,One of the Best Albums of the early 90's,"These guys would have been superstars. My wife and I have loved this album for the past decade. When I first bought it, I couldn't believe there had been no followup and I even half-suspected the whole thing was a hoax by some top musicians performing under pseudonyms for contract reasons or something. Eventually I tracked down the story of the crash that killed most of the band. So I had the experience of waiting and wanting more, being baffled by the band's obscurity and then learning there would be no more, quite like this. I would like to get my hands on the first album. If the label had a brain it would find a way to market these guys. It's great music and a sad but powerful tale behind the music."
3,Not very good,"I just recieved this video game today and I found it extremely hard. It was impossible to get past the Gold Rush level as you had to do three things: find Tommy, have zero items in the item monitor, and also find the Time Portal. I will keep trying to pass the Gold Rush level but I am sure that it will take me, like, three centuries. Also, they give you hardly enough time to complete levels."
2,for kids only!,This game is so easy I beat it in less than an hour and never played it since. This game is for little kids or kids who are very inexperienced at game boy. In short unless you are like what I said above don't buy this game. It [stinks]! I only gave it two stars because it was really fun while I played it. Try again for a hit THQ.
1,TOO CONFUSING!,"I got this game a couple of years ago and I HATE IT! It is way to confusing and No WHERE does it tell you what to do or what the object of the game is. I have played it probably a thousand times and I still don't no what to do! I really like the Rugrats and I am 13, but I couldn't figure this game out. Please listen to ME, RENT this game and see if you can figure it out if you can PLEASE write instructions because I would love to know how. Once again I would strongly advise you to listen to this review. THANX for your time!"
2,Too difficult for a 6 year old,"My six year old is an experienced game boy player. He very much enjoys the Rugrat movie game version. But this new version, with the promise of enticing levels to follow, leaves you that much more frustrated trying to get through the first level. The first level is incredibly monotonous and difficult. It may well be enjoyed by an older player."
4,Definitely frustrating and too hard for children,"We bought this game for my 5 year old, as her first game. It is definitely too hard for a child. She can't get past Chuckie. I played it too, and as an inexperienced game boy player I found it very frustrating. I did get one level past the Pyramid level, but was extremely frustrated. However, it is very hard to put the game down once you start figuring out the tricks to getting through the levels. Once you get past the first level and find Tommy, the next levels don't seem to be quite as hard. The hardest part is figuring out exactly what to do. I did not realize until I played it for awhile that you won't find Tommy until you find 15 bottles. After that Tommy will appear. Once Tommy appears you can leave the portal to the next level."
1,Better yet...,"I was the one who wrote the ""I thought it was hard too..."" review. I changed my mind about what i said about it being good. It's way too hard and barely gives you enough time to complete the levels. I could not get past the goldmine level even though i found TOMMY i just did not find the time portal. Don't get this game if you are under the age of twenty years of playing Game Boy. It's too hard."
2,RUGRATS TIME TRAVELERS,I bought this game 8 months ago for my neice's birthday because her and my daughter are in love with the cartoon series. My neice& daughter is 9 and they are still unable to get passed the gold rush screen. The directions for this game are horrible. Needless to say this game is in a drawer collecting dust. This game is too hard for the recommended ages.
5,A Particularly Fine Local History,"First released in 1959, Templemen's book is a rich local history of Arlington County, Virginia and the surrounding areas (Fairfax, Alexandria, and the District of Columbia.)This large format hardback: cloth over hardback boards with a sewn binding, dustjacket, 200 pp, has something like 250 b&w; illustrations: photos, current photos, period prints, and period paintings.This is a history of structures and of architecture, yes, but the book captures the people, the legends, and the history of this important part of America."
2,A Disappointment for Me,"I found this CD in a bargain bin today, and I am glad I did not get it at full price when it came out. I guess I was expecting (hoping) the CD to sound like a continuation of the Bangles--but it is nothing like it. Her voice sounds strained, and the music is rather bland. It almost sounds like she has a cold or something."
1,You've got to be kidding!,"You guys who bash Susanna's first album but love this one must be on downers. ""When your a boy"" captured much of the same sound that made her popular duringthe 80s. This album is a big bore and I couldnt make it through one song. Stricktly for the hippies."
3,Unpretentious and affecting,"This is a much better CD than her first effort--while there aren't a lot a stunners here, there are no clinkers. All I Wanted and Beekeeper's Blues are standouts and she seems to be developing a really good songwriting gene. I do advise you to buy the Japanese version--the covers of To Sir With Love and Gerry Rafferty's Stuck In The Middle With You are worthy of one whole star. The latter is done with/re-built by Matthew Sweet and it kicks more than her whole CD!"
3,Susanna Hoffs best effort since The Bangles,"A good effort by Susanna Hoffs. Far better than her first solo effort, but still only matching the the lesser of The Bangles Albums. The best tracks are the none listed tracks (Stuck In The Middle With You). Even though this album is not better than The Bangles ""Everywhere"" it is still still an Album well worth finding (It is not readily available In The UK)."
4,"Quite good, actually","While I was disappointed with ""When You're a Boy,"" I didn't think it was horrible. This one is much better, though -- and while she isn't Aimee Mann, any efforts in that general vein are to be encouraged.Highlights include ""Weak With Love,"" ""Enormous Wings"" and the hidden cover of ""Stuck in the Middle With You."" Lowlights -- well, nothing's unlistenable, really, but ""Falling"" and ""Darling One"" are not my favorites.And, FWIW, I happen to like both ""All Over the Place"" and ""Manic Monday."""
5,"A rocking, power-poppy good time","While I'm not going to repeat all the comparisons to the various bands with whom Imperial Teen share parts of their sound, I'll freely say that if you have the opportunity to see this band live (they're currently touring with The Breeders), by all means, DO IT.Within days of seeing them in San Francisco, I'm the proud owner of all three of their albums, and this one, perhaps on the strength of the two-minute punk/pop energy of ""Water Boy"" alone, is my favorite.These guys are so damn fun, I dare you to listen and not smile. Or dance, even. Good, good stuff."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"A Christmas gift for my daughter and her 3 children (6-9) (purchased elsewhere). They faithfully put in coins, saving for a special treat. The kids loved to operate it and their mom loved that it taught them about money and about saving together.After 3-1/2 weeks they'd saved $9.55 and were very excited that soon it would open. And then it jammed. Daughter contacted the company and they sent a replacement. That one jammed after even fewer coins were deposited. When daughter contacted the company again, she received no reply.Considering what this bank costs, it's a very poor buy. My brother and I had one of the original ones, back in the 50's. It lasted for years. I feel like I wasted my money and my daughter and grandchildren were very disappointed. Much as we all loved the concept, I can't afford to try buying another."
1,Can't get money out,"My son patiently put all of his money in there until it read $[...]. It is supposed to unlock the money at this point but it didn't, and there is no other way to get the money out. When I called the company to ask for help they told me to smash the bank with a hammer! This is a terrible toy."
3,Second try was a charm!,"Despite all the Uncle Sam imagery, this toy is made in China. So when it arrived, sure enough, the first quarter we put in jammed. We sent it back (at our own expense) and were promptly sent a new one that works fine. My 8-year-old daughter loves it (it's her savings bank for her newly-offered allowance, so overall, we're happy about the purchase. She doesn't like all the modern techno-banks out there, and this one certainly has an old-fashioned feel. Too bad it isn't made in the USA with reliable quality."
3,nice memories... ...sadly gone,"When I spent the summer of '96 in London, I had the pleasure of meeting, then eventually hanging out with the cuties of Menswear. Every time I listened to this album, it reminds me of how ridiculous and wonderful the retro mod scene was. They were huge in Japan (is that good?) and everyone would whisper in excitement when they entered ""The Spread Eagle"" pub. They had that perfected cocky rock-star attitude. When I returned the following summer, some members had been in mental hospitals, and others told me they were dating a girl named Charlie (meaning cocaine). Even worse, the ugly one tried to kiss me! This is the perfect album to remember London being as sweet and swinging as in the early 60's. I suppose history DOES repeat itself..."
1,pulp without the conejos,"British bands sometimes rely too much on their wimpiness to be charming. Menswear lack the talent and creativity to be charming. Jarvis Cocker of Pulp has perfected the persona that Menswear strive for. In their own words in ""Being Brave,"" ""I don't believe in being brave/ bah bah bah bah."" Bland, uninteresting trip over ground other bands have done far better."
4,great game,"Ok I remember playing this game a long time ago and LOVING it. But after installing the latest patches and giving it another go I have to wonder...WHO decided to make the enemies be able to shoot you from so far away?Whoever did that and made that decision...ruined the game. I am going to uninstall the patch and play again and see if it changes things because I swear it wasnt like that when I played it the first time around. I will update after trying it sans patch.UPDATE: the problem wasnt the patch, it was my memory. My apologies to any this review affected (prolly like 10 people lol). This is a great classic game and I hope you try it."
4,"Great game, but an old one.","I like this game a lot. The multiplayer, either skirmish or with some friends, is among the best out there. The game allows for many different ways to attack, like ground invasion, missiles, air strikes, artillery fire, or just nuke the enemy bases. Plus, every attack has a defense, so good players can stop just about every attack against them. This can lead to very long matches with no clear cut winners.The largest flaw with this game is its age. The engine doesn't allow zooming in or out. Most commanding happens through the mini-map, which can take some adjusting. However, a more advanced engine that supports Total Annihilation maps and mods has been released. It's named ""TA Spring"". I highly recommend that engine as well. Aside from the engine, there were no major flaws to this game. It is one of the best RTS games ever made."
5,TA lives on!,"TA is an awesome game, a great way to relieve stress as it sweeps your attention into building armies to defeat your enemies. I thought it was lost to me as it was no longer compatible with the newer windows programs. Whoever converted it to work with XP, THANK YOU!! And thank you Amazon, for carrying it!"
4,Great game,"Downloaded this last night, I was going to buy Starcraft for nostalgia and tripped over this game while looking around. I got to say I am hooked, it may not be Starcraft exactly but it gives me a similar feel. Although a the animation isn't as good as Starcraft it gave me what I was looking for at a far better price tag and I could download it and play instantly. I recomend it."
5,This game is fun,Try the game for you're self but its classic fun. This game is pretty good for an old pc game.
5,TA,"One of the classic game, a must have for every strategic gamers.There isn't much info you can find about this game, but the game play's pretty intuitive."
3,Heyer Disappoints,"I'm a Georgette Heyer fan of more than 40 years and have loved almost everything she wrote (that I can get my hands on. I'm constantly surprised at how many of her books are hard to find or out of print.) And her mysteries have always been some of my favorites. But, frankly, I was disappointed in this one. The obligatory romance was delightfully sweet and perfectly typical, but there are several points that diminish the book's appeal: there were indeed too many characters with too little emphasis on the more interesting; the murderer wasn't fully fleshed out and came as a surprise to no one; and the denouement was a true let down, leaving me unfulfilled and at a loss. I must immediately re-read Behold, Here's Poison or Footsteps in the Dark just to regain my equilibrium."
3,Why can't I use it?,"As a beginner at the piano I thought this book could help me, since it is a ""teaching"" book. After getting part way thought this ""thick"" spiral bound book I found things in the book went beyond the beginners' understanding. Beginners can gain something from the book if they use it as a suppliment to a more basic book. It is not for beginners trying to learn on their own."
4,nice carpenter jeans,jeans was very nice well made i bought them for my sons they was well pleased i will be coming back for more
3,semi false advertized,"Not a button fly just a button waist. I saw that it said button fly closure and thought that meant total button fly, the pictures don't show a zipper"
3,Button Fly -- NOT!!!,"I order from Amazon literally daily, at least that's what my wife thinks! I have always been super pleased with the items, the delivery, and most importantly the service. I love carpenter jeans. I love button fly jeans. So this was a match made in heaven, right??? I questioned whether Lee would have button fly jeans, but the description clearly stated so. WRONG!!! These jeans have a zipper fly. This was more than likely my misinterpretation meaning the the fly closure was a button, but I did have my hopes up..."
4,Lee Men Dungarees Jeans,"My first purchase of clothes online and I must say this fits pretty good. I always had a problem buying clothes because of my height, so I had to try on before purchasing. But I will say this I will be shopping more for clothes online."
4,Men's Lee Carpenter Jeans,"The service was good, got them fairly quick. I ordered them for my son, so according to him they are good jeans. I have to take his word for it as I am not the one wearing them lol. They do look like good quality."
3,lee jeans,"Belt loops on both pair purchased had one or more loops barely sewn, loops are bound to come loose from jeans soon."
5,Great lightweight carpenter's jeans,"I've worn these for years and love them. When I lost weight, I ordered a new pair online. Same great quality."
2,colors are way off on amazon-returns a nightmare,"Beware---when buying these reduced price Lee Jeans, the colors that Amazon shows on the website are WAY OFF and returns to Amazon are a N-I-G-H-T-M-A-R-E!!!!"
2,I took a gamble and wasn't pleased.,The pants I bought didnt look like the one's on the website... I gambled and lossed... what can you do?
4,Fashion versus Fit!,"I ordered 3 pairs of these jeans for my husband. I ordered two pairs in a size 30x34 and one pair size 31x34, all in different washes. They are good quality fabric nice cut and all the colors were nice. The only problem is that the sizes are off a bit. One pair of the 30x34 were tight and one pair was loose. The 32x34 are identical in size to one pair of the 30x34. I got them on sale so for the money I am very pleased and nobody ever said ordering jeans online was easy!"
4,ovras,"ok ok Okey this product is exelent, the product is fine, beautiful and economic, good choice,my father is very happy whit tis product"
5,Very comfy!,"Great soft jeans fabric. Comfy all over. Love these jeans. Several washings only made them softer and more comfortable. Deep pocket. Great jeans! Reasonably priced, too!"
5,Only Pants I Wear,I have not found a more comfortable pair of pants for work or play than Lee Dungarees. Great at work with the extra room for movement and climbing.
3,light and comfortable,"The only complaint is that,The back pockets tend to rip at the top corner seems within a short time.I had a seemstress reinforce those edges, and now they are fine."
5,Great work jeans,"Great fit. Love them, I am tall and always get jeans that shrink and change lenth. These did not, Yea!"
2,Not for women.,"I have been trying to replace my Victoria's Secret carpenter jeans for awhile. While these are very good, sturdy jeans for a real carpenter, even though they fit, they are HUGE. Very baggy and basically clown pants. I will be donating them."
5,"Lee Hombres Peto Carpenter Jean, Stone Original, 34W x 32L",me quedo bien y es cómodo solo tengo que alegar que la tela es algo delgada me gustaría mas gruesa
2,disallusion,It was disappointing to fine out the first part of the book did not really appen as the author indicated
1,Arcaeological Link Proven a Hoax,"Look up CNN's archive reports of June 18, 2003 for the story about this hoax. Andre Lemaire's attempt at fame fell short when experts discovered the ossuary was a total fabrication. The box with the inscription that was supposed to be the 'smoking gun' to prove that Jesus had brothers, and Mary could not remain a virgin has absolutely no archeological credibility.A June 18, 2003 CNN story entitled ""'Jesus box' exposed as fake"" sank this theory and why this book is still being peddled is beyond me. The news story reads:""Officials with Israel's Antiques Authority announced Wednesday that while the box may date from the correct era, the inscription is a forgery added at a much later date.""The inscription appears new, written in modernity by someone attempting to reproduce ancient written characters,"" the officials said in the statement."""
1,Totally Lacking in Scholarship,"Citations are almost completely lacking, and what few footnotes there are refer back to the authors own work. Then, the quote on the back of the jacket attributed to USA Today is actually a quote from one of the authors that was published in USA Today.Finally, the name ""James"" is so common is early Christian Era Palestine, it's as if we are 2000 years in the future, a tomb is disovered with the name ""George"" on it and the authors are claiming that it is the tomb of George Bush. The authors present no evidence to overcome this fact.I'm not buying it, neither should you."
1,Sad....,"It has now been well publicized that the initial examination of ossuary by the Geological Survey of Israel was preliminary, and the Israeli Antiquities Authority has completed the full study and found the ossuary inscription to be a forgery. The GSI has now released a statement agreeing that it is a forgery...A word to the wise: Approach ""great scientific discoveries"" that are published in the popular press before peer review is completed with great caution, be it ossuary inscriptions or cold fusion. For the authors to rush to publish a book before the IAA had completed their work was very unscholarly. I am afraid that they have permanently damaged their reputations.Addendum: The ossuary owner, Oded Golan, has been arrested by the Israeli authorities on charges of fraud and forgery. According to the news reports he had a number of other artifacts ""in various stages of production"" in his shop."
3,Two Books In One,"Shanks wrote the first half of the book and he has the nasty habit of repeating certain phrases over and over. I really don't care if he ate at a restaurant where the wine was excellent and the fish was delicious. Fortunately, the discovery of James' apparent ossuary is interesting and worth reading. In the second half of the book, Witherington describes the historical significance of James' role in the church and how he has been overshadowed by Paul and Peter.I don't know whether to believe in the authenticity of the ossuary, but I did get a better understanding of early Christianity."
3,Wayne goes commercial?,"Well, I was disappointed to hear this musicfrom ""Brother Wayne."" On this CD he soundsmore like Bruce Springstone and CougarMello-camp. You know and I know that Waynecan do better, much better. On this CD hetakes the Motor City Ted Nugent Type soundof thirty years ago and dishes it up again.Now I used to be amazed at the Coltrane andSun Ra inspired jams that Wayne Kramer usedto do with the Five. He even sounded greatdoing ""Rambling Rose"" at the Grande. If youremember ""Looking at You,"" then you are awarethat Wayne can reach the dizzying heights offree-rock, jazz, or musical expression.Come on Wayne, get back to the real stuff!"
1,Unsafe and Waste of Money,"Put this on my registry and did receive it as a gift. One of the receivers when I put the battery in it started to burn and almost exploded the battery. The reception is full of static all throughout the house. I contacted the company and this is where I gave at least 1 star - they sent Fed Ex to pick it up to replace it, unfortuently I was giving birth when they came so I am in the process of contacting them to do this. But I am very worried about the product and will be buying a different brand anyway. I do not want to take any chances."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This product is horrible. When we first plugged it in it worked ok. Within hours we were getting horrible static. We tried all different places in our house to plug it in and it didn't get any better. We finally found two places where the static isn't THAT bad and we now leave the monitors there, plugged in and turned on ALL the time! One night, when the baby was fussing and my husband was trying to get some sleep, I turned of the monitor in the babies room and we found out that the recievers will then pick up a country radio station! Maybe that's the cause of the static. Horrible product. Do not waste your money unless you like to be disappointed or if you like to return products to the stores!"
2,Can't stand the buzz - too much static.,"Go for a 900MHz or 2.4GHz model - the 49MHz models pick up too much interference from your house power. I really hate static... everything else about this monitor is just fine, but I bet you will be happier in the long run spending $10 more on a higher MHz model."
5,Picks up everything!,"We've only been using it for about 2 months now but sofar it's worked very well. It picks up EVERYTHING...very sensitive. The light is very handy late at night when you want to check on your baby but don't want to turn on the lights and risk waking her up. Very soft, gentle glow."
1,It doesn't work,We brought this monitor home and it didnt work the second we had it in the house. There was so much static and it cut out. I threw it away because my dad bought us a good monitor with a temperature and humidity reading and it works well.
1,"Nice features, poor implementation","I wanted to like this monitor. I really did. We got the Fisher Price Sounds n Lights as a gift and exchanged it for this one because we thought the night light (glow) feature on this one was a nice touch. It was, except that the light kept flashing on and off. Maybe it was a defective switch. Maybe it's the poor design - the on/off switch is on the bottom of the unit, so if you don't have this thing sitting just right, it'll turn the glo light on and off. After a few frustrating attempts at getting it set right, we figured it just wasn't worth the trouble. It's back at the store now and the Fisher Price unit is back home.As far as reception goes, it was ok. The Fisher Price seems a tad clearer - but that might just be me."
3,Too Much Static and Feedback,"The monitor was good with the exception of the feedback and static from the receivers. I received one as a gift at my shower and it was great until the sound stopped working one night which prevented me from hearing my son cry in the middle of the night.I returned that defective one and exchanged it for the same model and the new one had more problems then the one I returned. I found the replacement to have to much inteference, feedback and static. The first one I would have kept if it wasn't for the defect with the sound on one of the receivers. But after experiencing the problems I have had with the replacement, I will be returning this one also and finding a new monitor that hopefully will work better."
1,Horrible Static in every room on every channel,"We received three different moniters at our baby shower and decided on this one. We did not set it up until the baby was born, otherwise, we would have known how horrible this product was. You cannot hear the baby over the static. It is so loud, it is nearly impossible to get to sleep at night. If my husband wouldn't have thrown out the box to this product, it would be returned back to the store ASAP. Please, do not leave the safety of your new baby in the hands of this horrible, full of loud static, product!!!"
1,Too much static!,My husband and I chose this monitor and then received it as a shower gift and seemed to work okay at first but the longer we had it the worse the static was. We tried replacing the batteries and that didn't work. Our daughter is only 3 months and we had to go out and get a new monitor. One of them completely stopped working altogther and the other barely worked. I do not recommend this monitor!
1,Terrible - Would not recommend,"After using these monitors for only five months, the volume broke. We could only turn them up full blast or not hear anything at all. A waste of money."
2,maybe i got a lemon,This monitor stinks. My bed is just on the other side of the wall from my son's crib and I still can't count on this thing. It actually stops working during the night.
3,LOTS OF INTERFERENCE,Not totally happy with this product. I can't run the dishwasher at night because it interferes with the monitor. The night light is nice. I can't compare with other monitors because this is the only one I have tried. It is nice to have two receivers as we live in a two story home.
1,Don't buy if you have a cordless phone.,"I got this monitor as a shower gift. I registered for it because it was supposed to be a good monitor and it had the dual receivers. All we get is static. We can't hear anything from the baby's room, no matter where we are in the house. I really would not recommend this monitor system."
1,Keep your receipt!,"I bought the Safety 1st Safe Glow Monitor late last year. Now it switches off in the middle of the night without warning. I can't help but wonder how many times my daughter has woken up crying and I didn't hear her because I was depending on this thing??? I tried to call Safety 1st to ask them about and was asked to jump through hoops in order to get a replacement for this cheap monitor. You will be asked to fax your receipt along with your information. They verify it and then ask you to mail certain parts from the unit. Finally they will send you a check or voucher to replace it. NOT worth my time. I've already told them that I am going to buy another monitor, but it will NOT be a Safety 1st product."
1,BUY FISHER PRICE!,"This has to be absolutely the worst baby monitor ever. It is extremely suseptable to electrostatic interference. The only sound it puts out is a constant high-pitched whine with intermitted levels of static. The more items you have plugged in (TV, lamp, coffee maker) the worse the noise gets.The noise to baby sounds ratio is terrible so we have to have turn up the whine and static even higher to hear him. This noise permiates the entire house.We had no idea this was wrong until we heard (or didn't hear) our friend's Fisher Price moniter. It was dead silent unless their son made noise. I can't wait to get our Fisher Price moniter so I can throw this one in the trash!"
1,Can hear the neighbors baby great!,"We could hear our babies music playing from our bedroom with our own ears, however using the monitor all we could hear was the neighbor's baby crying.We tried to change the channel (there are 2 to choose from), but it didn't work. Also the base sits on the on/off button so it kept turning itself off. We're exchanging it this weekend for another brand."
2,Nothing But Static,We registered this monitor because it was 2.4 ghz and I thought it would be better than a 900 mhz monitor. All I get is static and our bedroom is right across the hall from my daughters. Now I can't return it to babies r us because I don't have a receipt and it has been longer than 60 days. I am stuck with a monitor that doesn't work.
1,Static,"This monitor had static from the minute we plugged it in. It actually works better using just the batteries, which we went through like crazy. I wouldn't recommend this monitor."
1,Way to much Static!!,"This was one of the worst monitors i have ever dealt with. The static was so loud no matter what we tried that i was afraid i wouldnt be able to hear my baby. It wouldnt even pick up the baby mobile music over the static. We tried Fisher Price- Sounds and Lights, and it was just as bad. If you want a good, clear monitor, even 1500 ft away, go with the 2.4 Ghz Digital Monitor by Summer Infant products. Worked clear and gave a good distance that it was still very clear in. Only comes with one reciever, but batteries are rechargable."
1,Doesn't work in my tiny apartment.,"My husband suggests maybe our apt is too small and that is why there is all this feedback with the monitor.But that is bologna, I think these are just poor quality. I would like to hear my son while he is just fussing and not in all out tantrum mode. But there is so much static and hiss that these monitors are completely useless."
2,Lots of background noise.,"We had no idea which monitor to register for & picked this one b/c it had two receivers and was reasonably priced. It always has static and background noise (including our neigbors! but I'm told a lot of monitors do that), so the red light is always on. My son is still sleeping in our room so we hardley use it, but for my own piece of mind, we'll probably buy another monitor when he goes into his room. One that doesn't have so much background noise and static."
1,The biggest waste of money!!!,"This monitor was the biggest waste of money!!! I thought it would be great to have a monitor with a night light and a receiver in each room, and it would have been had the stupid thing actually worked. Within 3 weeks of my babies being born the light went out, you can't hear out of the receiver unless it's up full blast, and if the volume is up all the way you hear very loud static. I couldn't take it back because I didn't have the box or the reciept any more so all I would be able to do is get the same monitor again. So now I use my 4 year old monitor, and it's much better."
3,Reception is good but night light is awful!,"I registered for this monitor b/c it had two receivers. The receivers work well-rarely picks up any static BUT after the second week, the night light stopped working. I read the manual and YOU CAN'T REPLACE THE NIGHT LIGHT BULB. According to the manual, it's supposed to be a ""long lasting"" bulb but ours burned out after the second week! Luckily, the bulb doesn't interfere with the sound but it sure would be nice to have the bulb working."
1,Find another baby monitor,"Don't bother buying this monitor. It had horrible static everywhere in the house. I tried different outlets, dedicating an outlet to the base, and I still received a lot of static. It's also extremely sensitive to other noise. I could have the baby's bedroom door closed and hear my oldest son in his room. With all the noise it picks up, it's hard to enjoy some quiet time without the baby.Don't bother with this monitor... there are others out on the market for the same price that are much better!"
2,Do Not Waste Your Money!!!!!,"I bought this monitor for my second child. We had another one from our first child that we were still using by fisher price, and THAT one had been through three other sets of children before my own and still works great which is hardly the case with the safety first. It is not the first product I have purchased, but I am starting to think it will be my last. One of the two reciever's AC plug in broke when I was plugging it in, and the reception no matter how close or far from ANYTHING is full of static and bizarre noises. The second reciever's connection is so sensitive that if you blow on it, it will go off and then you must turn it and wiggle it until you can regain there connection. For a well known brand and for a monitor that has not even turned one years old yet (my son will be one in january), this is definitely the biggest waste in money yet."
3,Don't go to the light,"We got this monitor partly for the light. After using it for a month I can safely say I hate the light. The switch has no tactile feedback and is so sensitive that the weight of the device will hold the switch in a half-on/half-off state that makes the light flash like a cheap disco strobe. It would be nice to be able to override the 15 minute timer so you don't end up feeding baby in the dark.The sound quality of the monitor is good, if a little over-sensitive and we like having two receivers."
2,Awful!,"I just got this monitor because my old monitor (Graco Digital) broke after only two months... I hate this one, it is really awful. One channel doesn't work at all, you just get incredibly loud static. The other channel works, but has a loud loud buzzing noise that is impossible to get rid of or ignore. Awful! I am taking it back."
1,horrible,"I received this monitor set as a gift. One of the receivers didn't even work straight from the package. When I called customer support, they were so uncooperative and told me that since I didn't have the receipt, there were nothing they can do. That was the least of the problems we experienced with this monitor. The static it picks up is unbelievable! It would pick up the noise of our dryer so loudly that we always questions whether we hear the baby. Also, the whole set stopped working one night after a few weeks, so now we have to look for a new monitor set pronto!"
4,good value for the price,"We bought these for our 2nd baby because we needed another monitor with 2 receivers. After much searching online and in the stores, we found these on Amazon for nearly half the price of the monitors in the store. I was curious as to how bad the static would be after reading some other reviews but I have to tell you that we have little to no static whatsoever. The range is pretty good too. We are pretty happy with this purchase!!"
4,middle of the road,"These listeners work well for the price. I use one from the basement when my little man is sleeping on the second floor of the house, so distance is pretty good. Compared to our old set (that died from being dropped to much) the sound is not nearly as clear, and you get a pretty good amount of static, but that doesn't stop you from hearing the kids.If you want to hear their breathing, this isn't the listener for you. In our house, we're only worried when the kid actually wakes up and starts to fuss, so these listeners work well.We bought some quality 950ma rechargeable batteries for ours. If you are using the listener without a plug-in nearby, it will eat through batteries rather quickly. The rechargeable batteries are a real money saver.If the price were higher, I probably would only give these a 3. But they are pretty low cost, so they earn a 4."
5,Love it,"This monitor is very sensitive, picks up the slightest sounds. It has a good range, haven't had any interference from the cordless phone. It has very little static. The dim light is perfect for a night light, stays on long enough to get things done. Definately worth the money."
1,Doesn't work when you have a wireless network,"We were not able to use this since it uses the same frequency as wireless networks. So, if you have ANY wireless network at home, you will not be able to use this monitor, you will get continuous static with no reception."
4,It works for us...,"I bought this monitor for my two year old son when we moved into a two story house from an apartment. I liked the fact that it had two recievers(one on each floor), and my son liked the night light. The monitor is very sensitive. I can hear my son breathing, which is important to me because he has athsma. However, it does sometimes pick up static, especially if you have a cell phone near by. Despite it's occasional mishaps, I still feel it's a good monitor, and would recommend it to others."
1,STATIC! DO NOT BUY IF YOU'RE PLANNING 2 USE OTHER APPLIANCES,"This was the first monitor we have purchased as it got decent reviews from consumers. Well, may be if you don't have a cell phone, a wireless phone, at TV, etc. this product will work for you. It's great when everything is turned off. However, if you turn any of the appliances on ... well, you're in for lots of static! We had this this monitor for over 3 months as we only used it at night (we live in an apt. and don't really need it on during the day as we can hear the baby w/out the monitor). We are now shopping for a new one as we're starting to use the monitor during the day / evening and can't even watch TV as the static is ridiculous!"
1,don't buy it!!!!,"Based on all the reviews and the looks of this monitor I thought it would be the best choice. Like many of the other reviewers, even the ones with high ratings, there is just way too much static and interference. We have tried different outlets in different rooms, using batteries only, nothing helps. We are going to exchange it and try a different brand. You need to read all the reviews, not just the ones with low rates, because the others mention the static also! I wish I would have taken my own advice."
4,"Worked in one house, but not the other...","When we were in our old house, it worked fabulously. I liked the night light to softly light up the room to see without turning on the main light. The receivers worked really well. The one thing I disliked was the way they ate up batteries. Gobbled 9 volts very quickly - less than 12 hours...But, it works very badly in this new house. We have to buy something else because all I get is static and it's very annoying."
2,This monitor doesn't work for us...,"Maybe it is our wireless network and phones, but we never got anything but static from this monitor. We could not get this one to work for us at all. And the night light feature wouldn't stay on, it just flashed incessantly unless it was sitting just right.We passed it on to my in-laws to use in their house for when they watch our son, and it does seem to work in their house. This is the only reason I gave it 2 stars."
2,They say it's great....but,"I bought this item because the reviews were great and the price was right. Two months later and it doesn't work. I have replaced the bateries many times. At first it worked great. Now when it's on, there's either no volumn or all you hear is static. I do not recommmend this product."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this monitor. We bought our first one for our son a little before he turned a year. It worked great! We loved it. Then about 1 year down the road one of the receivers stopped working. We loved having both receivers so we decided just to use the old one when we travel (since the one receiver did still work) and buy a new one for the house. It was awful. I honestly thought we had gotten a defective model. Took it back and got another one and got the same results. Horrible static! We couldn't hardly hear the cd player we run in his room with lullaby music and it was sitting pretty close to that where we had always had the old one. I don't know if they did something new to it to ""improve it"" but they went the wrong direction. I would highly recommend you NOT buy this product. We are in the same house, it is in the same room and we are getting much much different results. The older model was much better."
3,Eats Batteries!!!,I don't have much experience with monitors but this one eats batteries like crazy and depending on where it is... gives a tone of feedback.On a good note... it picks up everything which for a paranoid first mom is wonderful!!
4,So far so good!,"So far these monitors have been great. They pick up every little sound so you don't have to wonder if what you heard was the baby or not. We have used them for 2 weeks straight now, have had no static at all. We did pick up what we think was the neighbor's reception for about 10 seconds...no biggie."
1,TOO MUCH STATIC!!,This monitor looked like such a great buy! Boy were we wrong! We returned it for the SONY 27 channel monitor. (also wrote a review on it!)We registered for this monitor mainly because of the dual receivers (we live in a two story home) It also had a night light and it was a good price...not cheap but not too expensive! For how little this monitor worked it should be priced at $9.99! There was soooo much static! The night light didn't work half the time. You would have to push the button a few times for it to light up! I gave this monitor one star for its nightlight that automatically turned off after about 15 minutes (good idea if they can get it to work!)Do some shoppin around before you buy this product...or better yet just go out and buy the Sony!
1,LOUD Static,"We recieved this at our baby shower after we had registered for it. We Tried it out and the static on it was so loud you couldn't hear the baby if you tried. In addition, the loud static drove us mad. We took it back to the store."
1,Complete disappointment,"I bought this product after reading the reviews here, and I was VERY disappointed. We use a fan in our baby's room, and our last monitor had no problem transmitting all sounds! We dropped out last monitor one time too many, and bought this one. With the fan on, you can hear NOTHING coming out of the monitor except occasional loud bursts of static. Without the fan on, it works OK, but that doesn't really help us. Very disappointed."
1,ALL YOU HEAR IS STATIC,"Do not buy, this monitor gives you nothing but static, I could not hear my child at all."
3,It works for a little while,"I received a set of receivers for my shower and one of them did not work. I returned that one for another and they worked great for about 2 months and now they have a lot of static. When you turn the volume up you can hear a buzzing noise that is really annoying when you are trying to sleep. I just loved them when they did the job, but I am tempted to return them to find out what else is out there."
1,To Noisy,After reading all the positive reviews on this monitor I registered for it and received it as a shower gift. I just recently started using it and all I can hear is noise from all over the house. If I am in the living room and my daughter is sleeping in her room I can hear the TV in the living room through the monitor. Plus it has a lot of static. I would not recommend this product.
1,Can be dangerous to some...,"This monitor is definitely cheap for a reason. I will say that for the 1st 3 months it worked...ok. Then when I went to use the light it flashed like 12 times per second or so, upsetting my baby and making it very frustrating. What is worse is that this type of light flashing is dangerous to epileptic children and adults. It can cause seizures in those who are photo-sensitive. Now, 8 mos later, neither receiver even works. I called the company and was put on hold for 1/2 hr. I held on while I worked because I felt it was important to make them aware of this. And these reviews helped me out so much when we were deciding what to register for, I wanted to help others decide. Spend a bit more if you can, it is worth it to hear your baby clearly. You will get ALOT of use out of it so play it safe. I'm off to read reviews as we need to buy another one. They won't refund us til we send the old one's pieces. Wish me luck!"
1,1 Star is too much for this monitor!,"I was given this as a shower gift. From the moment I tried using this all I got was feedback. Even on the lowest setting the static is extremelly loud!!!! It has never worked even talking directly into the unit you cannot hear anything. Good luck shopping, I live by the product reviews so I hope this helps you!"
4,Its pretty good,"This monitor seems to be working great so far. I can go anywhere in the house and still hear her crystal clear, it even works while im outside. The only thing is that the battery gets used up pretty fast and if i plug it in i get mostly static."
1,Poor reception,"We tried this one out since all the reviews I read were so good but unfortunately, we were not pleased with it. When you plug it into the wall it seems to have a lot of static and it doesn't seem to matter where in the house you try it. Don't waste your money..."
1,NOTHING BUT STATIC!,"My wife and I purchased this Safety 1st monitor with dual receivers today. Once home, we put in fresth 9volt batteries and also plug the monitors into the wall with the AC plug. All the lights light up and all we hear is static. Pure junk. I am taking it back to the store after dinner. Disgust!"
1,Don't bother,WE got this as a shower gift and could never use it because it had static everywhere in our house. Everywhere. It's worth the money to get a higher priced one that you will actually use. We bought a Sony and it gets no static. The Safety first people told me it was because of our satellite dish and we'd never be able to use any monitor. WRONG. It was theirs that didn't worik.
2,Strange whining noise,"Sometimes the monitor works just fine. However, it often produces this high-pitched whining sound that is annoying and at times wakes our soundly sleeping baby. It always works for its intended purpose though, which saved this product from a one star rating."
1,Buy the Sony 900mhz instead!,"I had a Fisher Price monitor that worked well for the first year, but after that it steadily got worse until we had to throw it out after a year and a half. So, after reading the positive reviews on this product I decided to give it a try. I was very disappointed--it had lots of static and interferance. I could pick up my neighbor's son across the street better than I could my own son down the hall no matter what channel I tried. And if the receiver was in the bathroom I could not pick my son up at all. I never had this problem with the Fisher Price monitor. (...)"
1,Just threw mine out,"After reading the great reviews on this product, I registered for it for my baby shower. Unfortunatly the box was destroyed or I would have returned it long ago. It works about 2% of the time. The static is overwhelming, usually three lights are lit by the static alone. Every now and then it works okay, so I give it another chance. I just got out of the shower to here my 4 month old screaming her head off and the monitor didn't pick up a peep. I've tried all of the suggestions to remedy the problem, but this monitor just doesn't work. I have an older safety first monitor that works on the same frequency and have had fewer problems with reception, but it still has static."
1,"Bad for Apartments, lots of static","I bought this and set it up days before our daugther was born. I am glad I did because we instantly picked up the neighbor's baby who lives in the townhouse 3 doors down from us- imagine the confusion! Even changing stations didn't help- we still picked up the sounds from their monitor AND even more static! I followed all the directions to avoid other interferrances but none helped. When you turn up the volumne, even if the monitor and hand units are in separate rooms, they will make a horrible sound as though they are still ""too close"", so you have to turn down the volumne thus making it nearly impossible to hear the sounds of your baby- especially over all the static!I read lots of reviews on all the monitors and thought this one would be the best for our money but this one is going back to the store ASAP!"
3,Good product for the price. Lasted only one year.,"This is a simple product. It works well but can have quite a static at times. The receiver died on me after 1 year. It consumed 1 9 volts battery every other night. Next time, I am getting a rechargeble ones, it will be a Sony."
2,Better monitors out there,"We registerd for this monitor, and I wish I would have picked another- maybe the video monitor? I have to say that this does pick up every little noise which is a good thing. We can even hear our neighbors in their house next door in it. However- I dont know if we had a faulty item, but our nite light burned out about 2 weeks after having it!!!!!! And per the instruction booklet, the bulb is not replaceable. This was a big disappointment! And when I walk past the receiver in our bed room, there is an interference. As far as the light bar to indicate the noise level. If you have a humidifier or air purifier in your nursery like us, this feature doesn't help. Because of the constant noise, the bar is always lit. (not a fault of the manufacturer)"
4,Tip to reduce interference/static,"The reception of this monitor is excellent - we can hear the baby smack her lips as she starts to wake up - and having 2 receivers is VERY convenient.This monitor and others were sometimes given low marks due to problems with static. We found that older portable phones can cause static when in use and that using certain outlets produced static. So if you experience static, try different outlets and check the channel options on your portable phones."
4,Pretty Good,"This monitor overall works great. We can hear every little russel that he makes. However, it sometimes gets a bit staticy when next to other electrical items (alarm clock, lamp etc.) but if you just reposition it or move it alittle it stops. We often do yard work when our son is napping and it has a little belt clip that works great and it gets good reception in the yard!!!"
4,A really good monitor to have!,"My husband and I had our first child last April, and received this monitor as a gift from a family member. We love it! I can hear just about everything he does.I can hear him breathing it's that good.The only thing that I found was after a few months the night light that is part of the main monitoring system went out and I am not sure how to replace it or if it even can be replaced. I guess I will need to call the maufacturer and see. Other than that it continues to work GREAT!! Very handy and portable if needed to be taken elsewhere."
2,Not a Great Buy,"We received this as a shower gift, and immediately had problems with it. We had to possition the recievers in just the right spots in our house so we didn't get horrible static. If we bumped the recievers we couldn't hear our son until we repositioned them. I won't say the reception was horrible, because when they worked they worked well. Also we loved the night light feature. Problem with that was you had to get used to it; the on off feature was so sensitive that if you didn't push it just right it turned into a strobe light. Finally after a few months the light just stopped working. We are now looking for another monitor with no static problems and a night light for the room. Don't waste your money on this product."
2,Not for us!,"The first night we used this monitor we noticed a high pitched buzz and some static. What really annoyed me, though, was the way our baby's chatter or cries were so distorted. The sound quality was really poor. I recommend the Graco Soundsleep monitor. We were using it for the past year and a half, and only bought a new one because one of the receivers is starting to go out. Oh well...I will continue to use it with only one, because the quality is MUCH better. I returned this one to the store today."
2,night light was nice,i got this monitor for a shower present i thought it would be great with two receivers and a night light. the only thing that was nice was the night light. i live in a mobile home if you know mobile homes the furnace is loud anyway but it didn't bother us coming thru the monitor. but one night i went to bed and turned it on and all i got was static the furnace wasn't running and we hadn't even moved the monitors at all so i wouldn't recommend this to anyone i am in the process of discussing this with safety 1st because like everyone else it waited until the package was gone. i think they should take them off the shelf.
2,works well-then terrible!,"I registered for this monitor. It worked well for a couple of months (just long enough so I threw out the packaging and can not send it back), but now the volume control does not work and it is either at top volume or completely off when you try to adjust the level. It is, as I have read other people say, extremely staticy now, but it may just be due to the volume control problem. The wire that connects to the receiver is also not secure and wiggles. Not recommended."
2,Didn't last,"I recieved this monitor set as a baby shower gift, and was thrilled as it was one less thing for me to purchase.It worked well for the first 4 months than, as I have read on the other reviews, the static started! Also the hole where you plug the adapter from the wall to the unit has issues. It has to be wiggled in just right to make the connection, which is scary because there have been times where the wire connection is loose and I lose sound during the night. Causing major panic when I cannot hear my son. But ironically due to the loud constant static, I know when to giggle the cord to get the connection again. Long story short- I'm buying a new one."
2,"Started out good, but then.............","I loved this monitor when we first got it. The idea of having the night light is wonderful and it was a nice soft glow. Then one day, the static started..it seemed there was something wrong with the volume switch, it had to be set ""just right"" to get away from the static. Now, I come home and the one monitor is just screaming with static and is just about to die. I am currently looking for something new."
1,Don't buy,"This monitor is not good in the long run. At first, it worked great. Then one receiver stopped working. Now, the other one isn't working, either. There is so much static that I can't hear the baby unless it is turned all of the way up. I would suggest buying a different monitor."
2,"Good sound quality, buy the glog ligth dont work","My wife and me bought this monitor 6 months ago. Now our baby has 2 weeks born, and the monitor works wreat in our house, but uno of the receptors always have the third LED on, the other receptor is fine. And the nightlight on the transmiter only works for one week."
1,Didn't work for us,"We were disappointed to find that this monitor did not work at all in our house. It was so static-y that my boyfriend couldn't even hear me over the noise and he was just down the hall. I'm very glad we tried it out before our son gets here. However, I'm not looking forward to having to keep trying out different monitors till we find one that will actually work."
1,Bad. Awful. Waste of Money.,"If you have anything wireless in your home (wi-fi, telephone, robot, tv remote) then save your cash and run, don't walk, away from this lemon of a monitor. It may look nice, but its functionality is around zero. If you like listening to white noise at high volume 24/7 just to be able to hear your baby, then this is the product for you."
2,Can you say- HATE IT!!!,this thing has so much static it's not even funny. I have heard my neighbors phone conversations. Took it back and got a much better and cheaper one.
2,Static,"This monitor worked fine for quite a while. Then our neighbors had a baby (we live in single family detached homes, so it isn't like we share a wall or are even that close...) and we started picking up their signal and getting a ton of static. We switched channels and still got the static, but it was tolerable since baby was a year old and I just wanted it to know when she woke up. Now we got a new TV and all we get is static. Seriously, if you have electronics or neighbors, get a better model."
1,It works great...At first.,"I registered for this monitor, and received it as a gift. We loved it at first. But we started having problems with them this past summer,just after my son turned 1. We couldn't use them outside because they got nothing but static and high pitched squealling (and we don't have a satellite like someone else mentioned). Now one of the receivers barely works. The on/off switch, which also controls the sound, doesn't work properly and makes it so we can't even hear our son, no matter how high you turn up the volume. There is some kind of short in the switch and no matter how many times I open it up I can't find it. Now I'm going to have to go out and buy new ones."
